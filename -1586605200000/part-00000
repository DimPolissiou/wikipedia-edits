Francis is the first [[Jesuit]] pope, the first from the Americas, the first from the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the first pope from outside Europe since the Syrian [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]], who reigned in the 8th century.\n\nBorn in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, Bergoglio was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was Argentina's [[provincial superior]] of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). He became the [[archbishop of Buenos Aires]] in 1998 and was created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 2001 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He led the Argentine Church during the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]]. The administrations of [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] considered him a political rival. Following the [[resignation of Pope Benedict XVI]] on 28 February 2013, [[2013 papal conclave|a papal conclave]] elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his [[papal name]] in honor of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].\n\nThroughout his public life, Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the poor and commitment to [[interfaith dialogue]]. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]] guesthouse rather than in the [[papal apartments]] of the [[Apostolic Palace]] used by previous popes. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming. He does not support unbridled [[capitalism]], [[Marxism]], or Marxist versions of [[liberation theology]]. Francis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|abortion]], [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]], [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|ordination of women]], and [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]]. He opposes [[consumerism]] and [[overdevelopment]], and supports taking action on [[climate change]], a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of ''[[Laudato si']]''. In international diplomacy, he helped to temporarily restore [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw|full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba]] and [[Theology of Pope Francis#Refugees and migrants|supported the cause of refugees]] during the [[European migrant crisis|European]] and [[Central American migrant caravans|Central American migrant]] crises. Since 2018, he has been a vocal opponent of [[neo-nationalism]]. Francis has faced increasingly open criticism, particularly from theological conservatives, on many questions, including the admission of civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Communion]] with the publication of ''[[Amoris laetitia]]'' and on the question of the alleged cover-up of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|clergy sexual abuse]], against which he promulgated ''[[Vos estis lux mundi]]''.\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Jorge Mario Bergoglio attended a salesian school between 1948 and 1949.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Jorge Mario Bergoglio (fourth boy from the left on the third row from the top) at age 12, while studying at the Salesian College (c. 1948\u201349)]]\nJorge Mario Bergoglio was born on 17 December 1936<ref name=\"directory\">{{cite web|title=Direttorju Ekklezjastiku 2016|url=http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|date=30 June 2016|publisher=The Church in Malta|language=Maltese, English|pages=1\u20132|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122212612/http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2016}}</ref> in [[Flores, Buenos Aires|Flores]],<ref name=Remeseira/> a [[Subdivisions of Buenos Aires|neighborhood]] of [[Buenos Aires]].<ref name=\"directory\"/> He was the eldest<ref name=Garrido/> of five children of Mario Jos\u00e9 Bergoglio (1908\u20131959) and Regina Mar\u00eda S\u00edvori (1911\u20131981).

It is taken from the homilies of the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]] on [[Gospel of Matthew|Saint Matthew's Gospel]] relating to his vocation: 'Jesus saw the tax collector and by having mercy chose him as an apostle saying to him: Follow me.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2013/03/18/pope_francis_:_miserando_atque_eligendo.../en1-674605 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705010045/http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2013/03/18/pope_francis_%3A_miserando_atque_eligendo.../en1-674605 |archivedate= 5 July 2013 |title=Pope Francis: \"Miserando atque eligendo\"... |first=Veronica |last=Scarisbrick |date=18 March 2013 |website= |publisher=[[Vatican Radio]] |accessdate=19 March 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>}}\n}}\n{{Infobox pope styles\n|image=Coat of arms of Franciscus.svg\n|image_size=200px\n|dipstyle=[[His Holiness]]\n|offstyle=Your Holiness\n|relstyle=Holy Father\n|deathstyle=\n}}\n{{Catholic Church sidebar}}\n'''Pope Francis''' ({{lang-la|Franciscus}}; {{lang-it|Francesco}}; {{lang-es|link=no|Francisco}}; born '''Jorge Mario Bergoglio''';{{efn|Pronunciation: {{IPA-es|\u02c8xo\u027exe \u02c8ma\u027ejo \u03b2e\u027e\u02c8\u0263o\u0263ljo|}} (Spanish), {{IPA-it|ber\u02c8\u0261\u0254\u028e\u028eo|}} (Italian)}} 17 December 1936) is the head of the [[Catholic Church]] and [[List of sovereigns of Vatican City State|sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City]] State. Francis is the first [[Jesuit]] pope, the first from the Americas, the first from the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the first pope from outside Europe since the Syrian [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]], who reigned in the 8th century.\n\nBorn in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, Bergoglio was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was Argentina's [[provincial superior]] of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). He became the [[archbishop of Buenos Aires]] in 1998 and was created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 2001 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He led the Argentine Church during the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]]. The administrations of [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] considered him a political rival. Following the [[resignation of Pope Benedict XVI]] on 28 February 2013, [[2013 papal conclave|a papal conclave]] elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his [[papal name]] in honor of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].\n\nThroughout his public life, Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the poor and commitment to [[interfaith dialogue]]. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]] guesthouse rather than in the [[papal apartments]] of the [[Apostolic Palace]] used by previous popes. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming. He does not support unbridled [[capitalism]], [[Marxism]], or Marxist versions of [[liberation theology]]. Francis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|abortion]], [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]], [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|ordination of women]], and [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]]. He opposes [[consumerism]] and [[overdevelopment]], and supports taking action on [[climate change]], a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of ''[[Laudato si']]''. In international diplomacy, he helped to temporarily restore [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw|full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba]] and [[Theology of Pope Francis#Refugees and migrants|supported the cause of refugees]] during the [[European migrant crisis|European]] and [[Central American migrant caravans|Central American migrant]] crises. Since 2018, he has been a vocal opponent of [[neo-nationalism]]. Francis has faced increasingly open criticism, particularly from theological conservatives, on many questions, including the admission of civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Communion]] with the publication of ''[[Amoris laetitia]]'' and on the question of the alleged cover-up of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|clergy sexual abuse]], against which he promulgated ''[[Vos estis lux mundi]]''.\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Jorge Mario Bergoglio attended a salesian school between 1948 and 1949.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Jorge Mario Bergoglio (fourth boy from the left on the third row from the top) at age 12, while studying at the Salesian College (c. 1948\u201349)]]\nJorge Mario Bergoglio was born on 17 December 1936<ref name=\"directory\">{{cite web|title=Direttorju Ekklezjastiku 2016|url=http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|date=30 June 2016|publisher=The Church in Malta|language=Maltese, English|pages=1\u20132|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122212612/http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2016}}</ref> in [[Flores, Buenos Aires|Flores]],<ref name=Remeseira/> a [[Subdivisions of Buenos Aires|neighborhood]] of [[Buenos Aires]].<ref name=\"directory\"/> He was the eldest<ref name=Garrido/> of five children of Mario Jos\u00e9 Bergoglio (1908\u20131959) and Regina Mar\u00eda S\u00edvori (1911\u20131981).

{"title_page": "Dhanka", "text_new": "{{use dmy dates|date=January 2016}}\n{{use Indian English|date=January 2019}}\nThe '''Dhanka''' are a tribe of India who believe themselves to be [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]], although they are unable to assert from whence they came. They are historically neither Hindu nor Muslim and their occupations have changed over time, as circumstances have dictated for survival. Although similar groups in India are often referred to as ''[[adivasi]]'', the Dhanka generally reject this term.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Moodie|first=Megan|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k6cQCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=We Were Adivasis: Aspiration in an Indian Scheduled Tribe|date=2015-08-20|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-25304-6|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Dhanka'' name may be derived the somewhat pejorative word ''dhanak'', meaning a forest dweller.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tcTz54VVHF4C&pg=PA13|title=Being Tribal |page=9 |first=Shereen |last=Ratnagar |authorlink=Shereen Ratnagar |publisher=Primus Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-9-38060-702-3}}</ref> However, it could also come from ''dhanush'', meaning ''bow'', which may reflect a historic association with that weapon.<ref name=\":0\" /> Tribal people - as agriculturists and hunters - historically carried bows with them everywhere.<ref name=\":1\" /> Anthropologist Megan Moodie says that their history and culture is poorly documented and that what does exist \"tend[s] to be brief and stress their 'insignificance' and lowness\". She notes that they are a sub-tribe of the [[Bhil people]], that they are today found throughout much of western India, and that there has been much official confusion regarding their identity, which has tended to impact on their position as a [[Scheduled Tribe]] (ST) entitled to various [[positive discrimination]] benefits. Much of that confusion centres around various names that have been posited as synonyms for ''Dhanka'', including ''Dhanak'', ''Dhankia'', ''Dhanuk'' and ''Valvi''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHistorically, Dhanka were soldiers and forest hunters of the northwestern part of India. Since they used to prepare bows (Dhanush) they are called Dhanka. Another interpretation about its origin is that the word Dhanka consists of 'Dhan' which means \u2018Paddy\u2019 and the person who grows paddy is known as \u2018Dhanka\u2019. In the pre-independence period, some Dhanka were engaged in the services of\u00a0jagirdars\u00a0/ landowners as\u00a0soldiers,\u00a0farmers and cultivators in\u00a0paddy fields. They used to do agricultural activities and cattle breeding.\u00a0SomeA lot of them\u00a0were soldiers too.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe [[2001 Census of India]] recorded the Dhanka in the state of [[Rajasthan]] as one of the 30 STs which did not form part of the [[Bhil]], [[Meena|Mina]] and [[Bhil Mina]] tribes. Those latter communities accounted for 93 per cent of the ST population at that time, whilst the combined population of the Dhanka, Tadvi, Tetaria and Valvi, which was recorded as being one community, comprised 77,047 people.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nToday, the community is regarded respectable and possess good amount of land and goods in the urban areas.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA lot of men from the community are in Indian defence forces. Both males and females of Dhanka community work to get their living. Children are engaged in subsistence activities from a very young age.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDhanka women look after the household affairs in their families. They also contribute to their family income through making strings and ropes of forest grass and jute.

Since they used to prepare bows (Dhanush) they are called Dhanka. Another interpretation about its origin is that the word Dhanka consists of 'Dhan' which means \u2018Paddy\u2019 and the person who grows paddy is known as \u2018Dhanka\u2019. In the pre-independence period, some Dhanka were engaged in the services of\u00a0jagirdars\u00a0/ landowners as\u00a0soldiers,\u00a0farmers and cultivators in\u00a0paddy fields.

Those latter communities accounted for 93 per cent of the ST population at that time, whilst the combined population of the Dhanka, Tadvi, Tetaria and Valvi, which was recorded as being one community, comprised 77,047 people.<ref>{{cite book |title=We Were Adivasis: Aspiration in an Indian Scheduled Tribe |first=Megan |last=Moodie |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-22625-304-6 |page=38 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k6cQCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA38}}</ref>\n\nToday, the community is regarded respectable and possess good amount of land and goods in the urban areas.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA lot of men from the community are in Indian defence forces. Both males and females of Dhanka community work to get their living. Children are engaged in subsistence activities from a very young age.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDhanka women look after the household affairs in their families.

She is currently the assembly woman of the [[Selangor State Legislative Assembly]] for [[Kampung Tunku (state constituency)|Kampung Tunku]] constituency in the state of [[Selangor]].\n\nShe is also division chief for DAP Socialist Youth (DAPSY) Damansara and organising secretary of the DAP Selangor women's wing.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nLim is the eldest of three children born to Lim Chin Chye, a retired lecturer at Institut Perguruan (IPG) Sultan Abdul Halim, Sungai Petani, and Wong Wai Ping, a retired teacher SK La Salle, Ipoh. Outside politics, she played some university rugby. She also has a YouTube channel of piano covers.\n\n== Education ==\n\nLim completed her primary education at SK Marian Convent, Ipoh and her secondary education at SMK (P) Methodist Ipoh before taking the [[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia|Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM)]] at SMK Methodist (ACS) Ipoh.\n\nShe graduated from [[The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology Business School|the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (HKUST)]] with a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in Finance on a scholarship sponsored by Kerry Holdings Ltd. As an international student representative in the HKUST Business School Undergraduate Representatives\u2019 Committee, she helped establish the Business Cohort Community (BCC) to help integrate freshmen into the varsity community. In 2013, she ran an emergency fundraiser in HKUST to support Typhoon Haiyan disaster victims. The 2-day fundraiser raised HKD 75,000 (~USD 9,600).\n\n== Early career ==\n\nUpon graduating, Lim worked as a conference producer covering Asia at [[Incisive Media]]\u2019s Hong Kong office. Her portfolio included two brands: Waterstechnology, covering financial technology and data for capital markets; and Risk.net, covering risk management, derivatives and regulation. Her flagship conference was the Asia Pacific Financial Information Conference (APFIC) 2014 and 2015, featuring technology providers such as Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg and Markit; exchanges such as CME Group, Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx); and buy-side and sell-side firms across Asia. Lim also pioneered the first Asia Pacific blockchain training course for capital markets players, Blockchain Bootcamp, held in Singapore in May 2016. Despite having left Incisive for Malaysian politics by then, the bootcamp has been replicated in Hong Kong and Sydney, with a subsequent Blockchain Applications workshop held in Singapore in March 2017.\n\n== Political career ==\n\nSpurred by the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement, Lim decided to return to Malaysia to participate in Malaysian politics. She began her political career as the political secretary of [[Tony Pua]], then MP of Petaling Jaya Utara (now renamed [[Damansara (Selangor federal constituency)|Damansara]]) and DAP National Publicity Secretary. She actively campaigned in the [[2016 Sarawak state election|2016 Sarawak State Elections]] for the [[Bukit Goram]] state seat, as well as the 2016 Sungai Besar by-elections. In September 2016, Lim was appointed as a Councillor for the [[Petaling Jaya City Council|Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ)]]. She championed issues such as youth and women empowerment and mental health, organising various forums and lectures. Lim was nominated as a DAP candidate for the [[Kampung Tunku (state constituency)|Kampung Tunku]] state constituency during the [[2018 Malaysian general election|2018 General Elections]]. She won the seat with a majority of 30,444 votes, beating [[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]]\u2019s Tan Gim Tuan as well as becoming Kampung Tunku\u2019s first female representative. At the age of 28 she was also one of the youngest candidates to stand for elections in Selangor. After GE14, Lim campaigned actively in the 2019 Cameron Highlands by-elections. Despite being an ethnic Chinese politician, she was posted to the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]]-majority [[Jelai (state constituency)|Jelai state constituency]] and stationed in FELDA Sungai Koyan 3.\n\n== Issues and causes ==\n\nIssues brought by Lim through speeches, writing and programmes as well in the State Assembly include: mental health, youth and women empowerment, civic education, national unity, and culture. Lim is a strong supporter of local cultural efforts such as the awardwinning SK Kampung Tunku Pawana Tari traditional dance team and the Khuan Loke Dragon & Lion Dance Association, which originates from Sungai Way New Village. The Kampung Tunku 2018 Malaysia Day celebration, themed \u201cKampung Tunku Kampungku\u201d (\u201cKampung Tunku, My Village\u201d), featured an exhibition of Kampung Tunku's history and notable residents, including the National Laureate Usman Awang and Yap Ah Loy's descendants. Residents also submitted stories and photos growing up and living in Kampung Tunku. Performances and food were provided by local residents and traders. Lim is currently supporting the Selangor Rugby Union (Malay: Kesatuan Ragbi Selangor; KRS) women's team and the national women's rugby team through contributing funds and raising awareness about women's rugby.\n\n== Election results ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:90%\"\n|+'''[[Selangor State Legislative Assembly]]'''\n!Year\n!Constituency\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!Votes\n!Pct\n! colspan=\"2\" |Opponent(s)\n!Votes\n!Pct\n!Ballots cast\n!Majority\n!Turnout\n|-\n|[[2018 Selangor state election|2018]]\n|[[Kampung Tunku (state constituency)|Kampung Tunku]]\n| {{Party shading/Democratic Action Party}} |\n|{{nowrap|'''Lim Yi Wei'''}} ('''[[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|DAP]]''')\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |'''34,477'''\n|'''89.53%'''\n| {{Party shading/Barisan Nasional}} |\n|Tan Gim Tuan ([[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]])\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |'''4,033'''\n|10.47%\n|38,821\n|'''30,444'''\n|79.88%\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* \"[https://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/376073 DAP: Does EC chair think current voter registration system is efficient?\"] ''[[Malaysiakini]]''. 17 Mar 2017.

She is currently the assembly woman of the [[Selangor State Legislative Assembly]] for [[Kampung Tunku (state constituency)|Kampung Tunku]] constituency in the state of [[Selangor]].\n\nShe is also division chief for DAP Socialist Youth (DAPSY) Damansara and organising secretary of the DAP Selangor women's wing.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nLim is the eldest of three children born to Lim Chin Chye, a retired lecturer at Institut Perguruan (IPG) Sultan Abdul Halim, Sungai Petani, and Wong Wai Ping, a retired teacher SK La Salle, Ipoh. Outside politics, she played some university rugby. She also has a YouTube channel of piano covers.\n\n== Education ==\n\nLim completed her primary education at SK Marian Convent, Ipoh and her secondary education at SMK (P) Methodist Ipoh before taking the [[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia|Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM)]] at SMK Methodist (ACS) Ipoh.\n\nShe graduated from [[The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology Business School|the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (HKUST)]] with a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in Finance on a scholarship sponsored by Kerry Holdings Ltd. As an international student representative in the HKUST Business School Undergraduate Representatives\u2019 Committee, she helped establish the Business Cohort Community (BCC) to help integrate freshmen into the varsity community. In 2013, she ran an emergency fundraiser in HKUST to support Typhoon Haiyan disaster victims. The 2-day fundraiser raised HKD 75,000 (~USD 9,600).\n\n== Early career ==\n\nUpon graduating, Lim worked as a conference producer covering Asia at [[Incisive Media]]\u2019s Hong Kong office. Her portfolio included two brands: Waterstechnology, covering financial technology and data for capital markets; and Risk.net, covering risk management, derivatives and regulation. Her flagship conference was the Asia Pacific Financial Information Conference (APFIC) 2014 and 2015, featuring technology providers such as Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg and Markit; exchanges such as CME Group, Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx); and buy-side and sell-side firms across Asia. Lim also pioneered the first Asia Pacific blockchain training course for capital markets players, Blockchain Bootcamp, held in Singapore in May 2016. Despite having left Incisive for Malaysian politics by then, the bootcamp has been replicated in Hong Kong and Sydney, with a subsequent Blockchain Applications workshop held in Singapore in March 2017.\n\n== Political career ==\n\nSpurred by the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement, Lim decided to return to Malaysia to participate in Malaysian politics. She began her political career as the political secretary of [[Tony Pua]], then MP of Petaling Jaya Utara (now renamed [[Damansara (Selangor federal constituency)|Damansara]]) and DAP National Publicity Secretary. She actively campaigned in the [[2016 Sarawak state election|2016 Sarawak State Elections]] for the [[Bukit Goram]] state seat, as well as the 2016 Sungai Besar by-elections. In September 2016, Lim was appointed as a Councillor for the [[Petaling Jaya City Council|Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ)]]. She championed issues such as youth and women empowerment and mental health, organising various forums and lectures. Lim was nominated as a DAP candidate for the [[Kampung Tunku (state constituency)|Kampung Tunku]] state constituency during the [[2018 Malaysian general election|2018 General Elections]]. She won the seat with a majority of 30,444 votes, beating [[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]]\u2019s Tan Gim Tuan as well as becoming Kampung Tunku\u2019s first female representative. At the age of 28 she was also one of the youngest candidates to stand for elections in Selangor. After GE14, Lim campaigned actively in the 2019 Cameron Highlands by-elections. Despite being an ethnic Chinese politician, she was posted to the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]]-majority [[Jelai (state constituency)|Jelai state constituency]] and stationed in FELDA Sungai Koyan 3.\n\n== Issues and causes ==\n\nIssues brought by Lim through speeches, writing and programmes as well in the State Assembly include: mental health, youth and women empowerment, civic education, national unity, and culture. Lim is a strong supporter of local cultural efforts such as the awardwinning SK Kampung Tunku Pawana Tari traditional dance team and the Khuan Loke Dragon & Lion Dance Association, which originates from Sungai Way New Village. The Kampung Tunku 2018 Malaysia Day celebration, themed \u201cKampung Tunku Kampungku\u201d (\u201cKampung Tunku, My Village\u201d), featured an exhibition of Kampung Tunku's history and notable residents, including the National Laureate Usman Awang and Yap Ah Loy's descendants. Residents also submitted stories and photos growing up and living in Kampung Tunku. Performances and food were provided by local residents and traders. Lim is currently supporting the Selangor Rugby Union (Malay: Kesatuan Ragbi Selangor; KRS) women's team and the national women's rugby team through contributing funds and raising awareness about women's rugby.\n\n== Election results ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:90%\"\n|+'''[[Selangor State Legislative Assembly]]'''\n!Year\n!Constituency\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!Votes\n!Pct\n! colspan=\"2\" |Opponent(s)\n!Votes\n!Pct\n!Ballots cast\n!Majority\n!Turnout\n|-\n|[[2018 Selangor state election|2018]]\n|[[Kampung Tunku (state constituency)|Kampung Tunku]]\n| {{Party shading/Democratic Action Party}} |\n|{{nowrap|'''Lim Yi Wei'''}} ('''[[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|DAP]]''')\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |'''34,477'''\n|'''89.53%'''\n| {{Party shading/Barisan Nasional}} |\n|Tan Gim Tuan ([[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]])\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |'''4,033'''\n|10.47%\n|38,821\n|'''30,444'''\n|79.88%\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* \"[https://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/376073 DAP: Does EC chair think current voter registration system is efficient?\"] ''[[Malaysiakini]]''. 17 Mar 2017.

{"title_page": "History of logic", "text_new": "{{Philosophy sidebar}}\nThe '''history of logic''' deals with the study of the development of the science of valid [[inference]] ([[logic]]).  Formal logics developed in ancient times in [[Indian logic|India]], [[Logic in China|China]], and [[Greek philosophy|Greece]]. Greek methods, particularly [[Aristotelian logic]] (or term logic) as found in the ''[[Organon]]'', found wide application and acceptance in Western science and mathematics for millennia.<ref name=\"Boehner p. xiv\">Boehner p. xiv</ref> The [[Stoicism|Stoics]], especially [[Chrysippus]], began the development of [[predicate logic]].\n\n[[Christian philosophy|Christian]] and [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic]] philosophers such as [[Boethius]] (died 524), [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna, died 1037) and [[William of Ockham]] (died 1347) further developed Aristotle's logic in the [[Medieval philosophy#High Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], reaching a high point in the mid-fourteenth century, with [[Jean Buridan]]. The period between the fourteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century saw largely decline and neglect, and at least one historian of logic regards this time as barren.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Oxford Companion p. 498; Bochenski, Part I Introduction, ''passim''</ref> [[Empirical methods]] ruled the day, as evidenced by Sir [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[Novum Organon]]'' of 1620.\n\nLogic revived in the mid-nineteenth century, at the beginning of a revolutionary period when the subject developed into a rigorous and formal discipline which took as its exemplar the exact method of [[mathematical proof|proof]] used in [[mathematics]], a hearkening back to the Greek tradition.<ref>{{cite book|url= http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Frege,Gottlob/Frege,%20Gottlob%20-%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic%20%281953%29%202Ed_%207.0-2.5%20LotB.pdf|title= The Foundations of Arithmetic|author= Gottlob Frege|page= 1}}</ref> The development of the modern \"symbolic\" or \"mathematical\" logic during this period by the likes of [[George Boole|Boole]], [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], and [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] is the most significant in the two-thousand-year history of logic, and is arguably one of the most important and remarkable events in human [[intellectual history]].<ref name=\"Oxford Companion p. 500\">Oxford Companion p. 500</ref>\n\nProgress in [[mathematical logic]] in the first few decades of the twentieth century, particularly arising from the work of [[Kurt G\u00f6del|G\u00f6del]] and [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]], had a significant impact on [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophical logic]], particularly from the 1950s onwards, in subjects such as [[modal logic]], [[temporal logic]], [[deontic logic]], and [[relevance logic]].\n\n==Logic in the East==\n\n===Logic in India===\n{{Main|Indian logic}}\n\nLogic began independently in [[History of India|ancient India]] and continued to develop to early modern times without any known influence from Greek logic.<ref>Bochenski p. 446</ref> [[Indian logic|Medhatithi Gautama]] (c. 6th century BC) founded the ''[[anviksiki]]'' school of logic.<ref>S. C. Vidyabhusana (1971). ''A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools'', pp. 17\u201321.</ref> The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (12.173.45), around the 5th century BC, refers to the ''anviksiki'' and ''tarka'' schools of logic. {{IAST|[[P\u0101\u1e47ini]]}} (c. 5th century BC) developed a form of logic (to which [[Boolean logic]] has some similarities) for his formulation of [[Vyakarana|Sanskrit grammar]]. Logic is described by [[Chanakya]] (c. 350-283 BC) in his ''[[Arthashastra]]'' as an independent field of inquiry.<ref>R. P. Kangle (1986). ''The Kautiliya Arthashastra'' (1.2.11). Motilal Banarsidass.</ref>\n\nTwo of the six Indian schools of thought deal with logic: [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]]. The [[Nyaya Sutras]] of [[Aksapada Gautama]] (c. 2nd century AD) constitute the core texts of the Nyaya school, one of the six orthodox schools of [[Hindu]] philosophy. This [[Philosophical realism|realist]] school developed a rigid five-member schema of [[inference]] involving an initial premise, a reason, an example, an application, and a conclusion.<ref>Bochenski p. 417 and ''passim''</ref> The [[Idealism|idealist]] [[Buddhist philosophy]] became the chief opponent to the Naiyayikas. [[Nagarjuna]] (c. 150-250 AD), the founder of the [[Madhyamika]] (\"Middle Way\") developed an analysis known as the [[catu\u1e63ko\u1e6di]] (Sanskrit), a \"four-cornered\" system of argumentation that involves the systematic examination and rejection of each of the 4 possibilities of a proposition, ''P'':\n# ''P''; that is, being.\n# not&nbsp;''P''; that is, not being.\n# ''P'' and not&nbsp;''P''; that is, being and not being.\n# not (''P'' or not&nbsp;''P''); that is, neither being nor not being.{{Paragraph break}}Under [[propositional logic]], [[De Morgan's laws]] imply that this is equivalent to the third case (''P'' and not&nbsp;''P''), and is therefore superfluous; there are actually only 3 cases to consider.\n\nHowever, [[Dignaga]] (c 480-540 AD) is sometimes said to have developed a formal syllogism,<ref>Bochenski pp. 431\u20137</ref> and it was through him and his successor, [[Dharmakirti]], that [[Buddhist logic]] reached its height; it is contested whether their analysis actually constitutes a formal syllogistic system. In particular, their analysis centered on the definition of an inference-warranting relation, \"[[vyapti]]\", also known as invariable concomitance or pervasion.<ref name=Matilal>{{cite book|last=Matilal|first=Bimal Krishna|title=The Character of Logic in India|year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=9780791437407|pages=12, 18}}</ref> To this end, a doctrine known as \"apoha\" or differentiation was developed.<ref>Bochenksi p. 441</ref> This involved what might be called inclusion and exclusion of defining properties.\n\nDign\u0101ga's famous \"wheel of reason\" (''[[Hetucakra]]'') is a method of indicating when one thing (such as smoke) can be taken as an invariable sign of another thing (like fire), but the inference is often inductive and based on past observation. Matilal remarks that Dign\u0101ga's analysis is much like John Stuart Mill's Joint Method of Agreement and Difference, which is inductive.<ref>Matilal, 17</ref>\n\nIn addition, the traditional five-member Indian syllogism, though deductively valid, has repetitions that are unnecessary to its logical validity. As a result, some commentators see the traditional Indian syllogism as a rhetorical form that is entirely natural in many cultures of the world, and yet not as a logical form\u2014not in the sense that all logically unnecessary elements have been omitted for the sake of analysis.\n\n===Logic in China===\n{{Main|Logic in China}}\nIn China, a contemporary of [[Confucius]], [[Mozi]], \"Master Mo\", is credited with founding the [[Mohism|Mohist school]], whose canons dealt with issues relating to valid inference and the conditions of correct conclusions. In particular, one of the schools that grew out of Mohism, the [[School of Names|Logicians]], are credited by some scholars for their early investigation of [[formal logic]]. Due to the harsh rule of [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] in the subsequent [[Qin Dynasty]], this line of investigation disappeared in China until the introduction of Indian philosophy by [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].\n\n==Logic in the West==\n\n===Prehistory of logic===\nValid reasoning has been employed in all periods of human history. However, logic studies the ''principles'' of valid reasoning, inference and demonstration. It is probable that the idea of demonstrating a conclusion first arose in connection with [[geometry]], which originally meant the same as \"land measurement\".<ref>Kneale, p. 2</ref> The [[ancient Egypt]]ians discovered [[Egyptian mathematics|geometry]], including the formula for the volume of a [[Frustum|truncated pyramid]].<ref name=Kneale3>Kneale p. 3</ref> [[Babylonian mathematics|Ancient Babylon]] was also skilled in mathematics. [[Esagil-kin-apli]]'s medical ''Diagnostic Handbook'' in the 11th century BC was based on a logical set of [[axiom]]s and assumptions,<ref name=\"Stol-99\">H. F. J.

Brown (2000), ''Mesopotamian Planetary Astronomy-Astrology '', Styx Publications, {{ISBN|90-5693-036-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Ancient Greece before Aristotle===\nWhile the ancient Egyptians empirically discovered some truths of geometry, the great achievement of the ancient Greeks was to replace empirical methods by demonstrative [[Mathematical proof|proof]]. Both [[Thales]] and [[Pythagoras]] of the [[Pre-Socratic philosophers]] seem aware of geometry's methods.\n\nFragments of early proofs are preserved in the works of Plato and Aristotle,<ref>Heath, ''Mathematics in Aristotle'', cited in Kneale, p. 5</ref> and the idea of a deductive system was probably known in the Pythagorean school and the [[Platonic Academy]].<ref name=Kneale3/> The proofs of [[Euclid of Alexandria]] are a paradigm of Greek geometry. The three basic principles of geometry are as follows:\n\n* Certain propositions must be accepted as true without demonstration; such a proposition is known as an [[axiom]] of geometry.\n* Every proposition that is not an axiom of geometry must be demonstrated as following from the axioms of geometry; such a demonstration is known as a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] or a \"derivation\" of the proposition.\n* The proof must be ''formal''; that is, the derivation of the proposition must be independent of the particular subject matter in question.<ref name=Kneale3/>\nFurther evidence that early Greek thinkers were concerned with the principles of reasoning is found in the fragment called ''[[dissoi logoi]]'', probably written at the beginning of the fourth century BC. This is part of a protracted debate about truth and falsity.<ref>Kneale, p. 16</ref> In the case of the classical Greek city-states, interest in argumentation was also stimulated by the activities of the [[Rhetoric]]ians or Orators and the [[Sophists]], who used arguments to defend or attack a thesis, both in legal and political contexts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/346217/history-of-logic#toc65918|title=History of logic|author=|date=|website=britannica.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Thales' Theorem.svg|thumb|130px|left|Thales Theorem]]\n\n====Thales====\nIt is said Thales, most widely regarded as the first philosopher in the [[Greek philosophy|Greek tradition]],<ref>[[Aristotle]], Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.</ref><ref name=\"CPM\">{{cite book|author = Smith|title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year = 1870|url = https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/1016|page = 1016|first = Sir William}}</ref> measured the height of the [[pyramids]] by their shadows at the moment when his own shadow was equal to his height.

He is known for his obscure sayings.\n{{quote|This ''logos'' holds always but humans always prove unable to understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this ''logos'', humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is.

(B 7.1\u20138.2)\n\n[[Zeno of Elea]], a pupil of Parmenides, had the idea of a standard argument pattern found in the method of proof known as ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''.

The members of this school were called \"dialecticians\" (from a Greek word meaning \"to discuss\").\n\n====Plato====\n{{quotation|Let no one ignorant of geometry enter here.|Inscribed over the entrance to Plato's Academy.}}\n[[File:MANNapoli 124545 plato's academy mosaic.jpg|alt=Mosaic: seven men standing under a tree|thumb|200px|[[Plato's Academy mosaic]]]]\nNone of the surviving works of the great fourth-century philosopher [[Plato]] (428\u2013347 BC) include any formal logic,<ref>Kneale p. 17</ref> but they include important contributions to the field of [[philosophical logic]]. Plato raises three questions:\n\n* What is it that can properly be called true or false?\n* What is the nature of the connection between the assumptions of a valid argument and its conclusion?\n* What is the nature of definition?\n\nThe first question arises in the dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', where Plato identifies thought or opinion with talk or discourse (''logos'').<ref>\"forming an opinion is talking, and opinion is speech that is held not with someone else or aloud but in silence with oneself\" ''Theaetetus'' 189E\u2013190A</ref> The second question is a result of Plato's [[theory of Forms]]. Forms are not things in the ordinary sense, nor strictly ideas in the mind, but they correspond to what philosophers later called [[universals]], namely an abstract entity common to each set of things that have the same name. In both the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and the ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', Plato suggests that the necessary connection between the assumptions of a valid argument and its conclusion corresponds to a necessary connection between \"forms\".<ref>Kneale p. 20.  For example, the proof given in the ''Meno'' that the square on the diagonal is double the area of the original square presumably involves the forms of the square and the triangle, and the necessary relation between them</ref> The third question is about [[definition]]. Many of Plato's dialogues concern the search for a definition of some important concept (justice, truth, the Good), and it is likely that Plato was impressed by the importance of definition in mathematics.<ref>Kneale p. 21</ref> What underlies every definition is a Platonic Form, the common nature present in different particular things. Thus, a definition reflects the ultimate object of understanding, and is the foundation of all valid inference. This had a great influence on Plato's student [[Aristotle]], in particular Aristotle's notion of the [[essence]] of a thing.<ref>Zalta, Edward N. \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-logic/#Def Aristotle's Logic]\".

Though it is difficult to determine the dates, the probable order of writing of Aristotle's logical works is:\n* ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|The Categories]]'', a study of the ten kinds of primitive term.\n* ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|The Topics]]'' (with an appendix called ''[[On Sophistical Refutations]]''), a discussion of dialectics.\n* ''[[De Interpretatione|On Interpretation]]'', an analysis of simple [[categorical proposition]]s into simple terms, negation, and signs of quantity. \n* ''[[Prior Analytics|The Prior Analytics]]'', a formal analysis of what makes a [[syllogism]] (a valid argument, according to Aristotle).\n* ''[[Posterior Analytics|The Posterior Analytics]]'', a study of scientific demonstration, containing Aristotle's mature views on logic.\n[[File:Square of opposition, set diagrams.svg|thumb|180px|This diagram shows the contradictory relationships between [[categorical proposition]]s in the [[square of opposition]] of [[Term logic|Aristotelian logic]].]]\nThese works are of outstanding importance in the history of logic. In the ''Categories'', he attempts to discern all the possible things to which a term can refer; this idea underpins his philosophical work ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', which itself had a profound influence on Western thought.\n\nHe also developed a theory of non-formal logic (''i.e.,'' the theory of [[logical fallacy|fallacies]]), which is presented in ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations''.<ref name=\"Bochenski p. 63\"/>\n\n''On Interpretation'' contains a comprehensive treatment of the notions of [[Square of opposition|opposition]] and conversion; chapter 7 is at the origin of the [[square of opposition]] (or logical square); chapter 9 contains the beginning of [[modal logic]].\n\nThe ''Prior Analytics'' contains his exposition of the \"syllogism\", where three important principles are applied for the first time in history: the use of variables, a purely formal treatment, and the use of an axiomatic system.\n\n===Stoics===\n{{Main|Stoic logic}}\nThe other great school of Greek logic is that of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].<ref>\"Throughout later antiquity two great schools of logic were distinguished, the Peripatetic which was derived from Aristotle, and the Stoic which was developed by Chrysippus from the teachings of the Megarians\" \u2013 Kneale p. 113</ref> Stoic logic traces its roots back to the late 5th century BC philosopher [[Euclid of Megara]], a pupil of [[Socrates]] and slightly older contemporary of Plato, probably following in the tradition of Parmenides and Zeno. His pupils and successors were called \"[[Megarian school|Megarians]]\", or \"Eristics\", and later the \"Dialecticians\". The two most important dialecticians of the Megarian school were [[Diodorus Cronus]] and [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo]], who were active in the late 4th century BC. \n[[File:Chrysippos BM 1846.jpg|alt=Stone bust of a bearded, grave-looking man|thumb|160px|[[Chrysippus]] of Soli]]\nThe Stoics adopted the Megarian logic and systemized it. The most important member of the school was [[Chrysippus]] (c. 278\u2013c. 206 BC), who was its third head, and who formalized much of Stoic doctrine.  He is supposed to have written over 700 works, including at least 300 on logic, almost none of which survive.<ref>''Oxford Companion'', article \"Chrysippus\", p. 134</ref><ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: [[Susanne Bobzien]], ''Ancient Logic''</ref> Unlike with Aristotle, we have no complete works by the Megarians or the early Stoics, and have to rely mostly on accounts (sometimes hostile) by later sources, including prominently [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], [[Sextus Empiricus]], [[Galen]], [[Aulus Gellius]], [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], and [[Cicero]].<ref>K. Huelser, Die Fragmente zur Dialektik der Stoiker, 4 vols, Stuttgart 1986-7</ref>\n\nThree significant contributions of the Stoic school were (i) their account of [[Modal logic|modality]], (ii) their theory of the [[Material conditional]], and (iii) their account of [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] and [[truth]].<ref>Kneale 117\u2013158</ref>\n\n* ''Modality''. According to Aristotle, the Megarians of his day claimed there was no distinction between [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|potentiality and actuality]].<ref>''Metaphysics'' Eta 3, 1046b 29</ref>  Diodorus Cronus defined the possible as that which either is or will be, the impossible as what will not be true, and the contingent as that which either is already, or will be false.<ref>[[Boethius]], ''Commentary on the Perihermenias'', Meiser p. 234</ref> Diodorus is also famous for what is known as his [[Master argument (Diodorus Cronus)|Master argument]], which states that each pair of the following 3 propositions contradicts the third proposition:\n:* Everything that is past is true and necessary.\n:* The impossible does not follow from the possible.\n:* What neither is nor will be is possible.\n: Diodorus used the plausibility of the first two to prove that nothing is possible if it neither is nor will be true.<ref>[[Epictetus]], ''Dissertationes'' ed. Schenkel ii. 19. I.</ref>  Chrysippus, by contrast, denied the second premise and said that the impossible could follow from the possible.<ref>Alexander p. 177</ref>\n\n* ''Conditional statements''. The first logicians to debate [[Material conditional|conditional statements]] were Diodorus and his pupil Philo of Megara. Sextus Empiricus refers three times to a debate between Diodorus and Philo. Philo regarded a conditional as true unless it has both a true [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and a false [[consequent]]. Precisely, let ''T<sub>0</sub>'' and ''T<sub>1</sub>'' be true statements, and let ''F<sub>0</sub>'' and ''F<sub>1</sub>'' be false statements; then, according to Philo, each of the following conditionals is a true statement, because it is not the case that the consequent is false while the antecedent is true (it is not the case that a false statement is asserted to follow from a true statement):\n:* If ''T<sub>0</sub>'', then ''T<sub>1</sub>''\n:* If ''F<sub>0</sub>'', then ''T<sub>0</sub>''\n:* If ''F<sub>0</sub>'', then ''F<sub>1</sub>''\n: The following conditional does not meet this requirement, and is therefore a false statement according to Philo:\n:* If ''T<sub>0</sub>, then ''F<sub>0</sub>''\n: Indeed, Sextus says \"According to &#91;Philo&#93;, there are three ways in which a conditional may be true, and one in which it may be false.\"<ref name=sextus-adv-math>Sextus Empiricus, ''Adv. Math.'' viii, Section 113</ref> Philo's criterion of truth is what would now be called a [[truth-functional]] definition of \"if ... then\"; it is the definition used in [[predicate logic|modern logic]].\n\n:In contrast, Diodorus allowed the validity of conditionals only when the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion.<ref name=sextus-adv-math /><ref>Sextus Empiricus, ''Hypotyp.'' ii. 110, comp.</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 47, ''de Fato'', 6.</ref> A century later, the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Chrysippus]] attacked the assumptions of both Philo and Diodorus.\n* ''Meaning and truth''. The most important and striking difference between Megarian-Stoic logic and Aristotelian logic is that Megarian-Stoic logic concerns propositions, not terms, and is thus closer to modern [[propositional logic]].<ref>See e.g. Lukasiewicz p. 21</ref> The Stoics distinguished between utterance (''phone''), which may be noise, speech (''lexis''), which is articulate but which may be meaningless, and discourse (''logos''), which is meaningful utterance. The most original part of their theory is the idea that what is expressed by a sentence, called a ''lekton'', is something real; this corresponds to what is now called a ''proposition''. Sextus says that according to the Stoics, three things are linked together: that which signifies, that which is signified, and the object; for example, that which signifies is the word ''Dion'', and that which is signified is what Greeks understand but barbarians do not, and the object is Dion himself.<ref>Sextus Bk viii., Sections 11, 12</ref>\n\n==Medieval logic==\n\n===Logic in the Middle East===\n{{Main|Logic in Islamic philosophy}}\n{{See also|Avicennism#Avicennian logic|l1=Avicennian logic}}\n[[File:Canon-Avicenna-small.jpg|alt=Arabic text in pink and blue|thumb|A text by [[Avicenna]], founder of [[Avicennism#Avicennian logic|Avicennian logic]] ]]\n\nThe works of [[Al-Kindi]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Ghazali]], [[Averroes]] and other Muslim logicians were based on Aristotelian logic and were important in communicating the ideas of the ancient world to the medieval West.<ref>See e.g. [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/H057 Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy Online Version 2.0]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YFDTux7u?url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/islamic-philosophy;jsessionid=B31B033F077DD5E68E09CC9D35C02105 |date=2015-05-03 }}, article 'Islamic philosophy'</ref> [[Al-Farabi]] (Alfarabi) (873\u2013950) was an Aristotelian logician who discussed the topics of [[future contingent]]s, the number and relation of the categories, the relation between [[logic]] and [[grammar]], and non-Aristotelian forms of [[inference]].<ref name=Britannica/> Al-Farabi also considered the theories of [[conditional syllogism]]s and [[Analogy|analogical inference]], which were part of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] tradition of logic rather than the Aristotelian.<ref>{{Cite journal | issn = 0022-362X | volume = 61 | issue = 22 | pages = 724\u2013734 | last = Feldman | first = Seymour | title = Rescher on Arabic Logic | journal = The Journal of Philosophy| date = 1964-11-26 | jstor = 2023632 | doi = 10.2307/2023632 | publisher = Journal of Philosophy, Inc.}} [726]. {{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-27556-3 | last = Long | first = A.

When the study of logic resumed after the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], the main source was the work of the Christian philosopher [[Boethius]], who was familiar with some of Aristotle's logic, but almost none of the work of the Stoics.<ref name=Kneale198>Kneale p. 198</ref>  Until the twelfth century, the only works of Aristotle available in the West were the ''Categories'', ''On Interpretation'', and Boethius's translation of the [[Isagoge]] of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (a commentary on the Categories). These works were known as the \"Old Logic\" (''Logica Vetus'' or ''Ars Vetus''). An important work in this tradition was the ''Logica Ingredientibus'' of [[Peter Abelard]] (1079\u20131142).  His direct influence was small,<ref>Stephen Dumont, article \"Peter Abelard\" in Gracia and Noone p. 492</ref> but his influence through pupils such as [[John of Salisbury]] was great, and his method of applying rigorous logical analysis to theology shaped the way that theological criticism developed in the period that followed.<ref>Kneale, pp. 202\u20133</ref>\n\nBy the early thirteenth century, the remaining works of Aristotle's ''Organon'' (including the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', and the ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'') had been recovered in the West.<ref>See e.g. Kneale p. 225</ref>  Logical work until then was mostly paraphrasis or commentary on the work of Aristotle.<ref>Boehner p. 1</ref> The period from the middle of the thirteenth to the middle of the fourteenth century was one of significant developments in logic, particularly in three areas which were original, with little foundation in the Aristotelian tradition that came before.  These were:<ref>Boehner pp. 19\u201376</ref>\n\n* The theory of [[Supposition theory|supposition]]. Supposition theory deals with the way that predicates (''e.g.,'' 'man') range over a domain of individuals (''e.g.,'' all men).<ref>Boehner p. 29</ref>  In the proposition 'every man is an animal', does the term 'man' range over or 'supposit for' men existing just in the present, or does the range include past and future men? Can a term supposit for a non-existing individual?  Some medievalists have argued that this idea is a precursor of modern [[first-order logic]].<ref>Boehner p. 30</ref> \"The theory of supposition with the associated theories of ''copulatio'' (sign-capacity of adjectival terms), ''ampliatio'' (widening of referential domain), and ''distributio'' constitute one of the most original achievements of Western medieval logic\".<ref>Ebbesen 1981</ref>\n* The theory of [[Syncategorematic term|syncategoremata]].  Syncategoremata are terms which are necessary for logic, but which, unlike ''categorematic'' terms, do not signify on their own behalf, but 'co-signify' with other words.  Examples of syncategoremata are 'and', 'not', 'every', 'if', and so on.\n* The theory of [[Logical consequence|consequences]].  A consequence is a hypothetical, conditional proposition: two propositions joined by the terms 'if ... then'.  For example, 'if a man runs, then God exists' (''Si homo currit, Deus est'').<ref>Boehner pp. 54\u20135</ref>  A fully developed theory of consequences is given in Book III of [[William of Ockham]]'s work [[Summa Logicae]].  There, Ockham distinguishes between 'material' and 'formal' consequences, which are roughly equivalent to the modern [[Material conditional|material implication]] and [[logical implication]] respectively.  Similar accounts are given by [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Albert of Saxony]].\n\nThe last great works in this tradition are the ''Logic'' of John Poinsot (1589\u20131644, known as [[John of St Thomas]]), the ''Metaphysical Disputations'' of [[Francisco Suarez]] (1548\u20131617), and the ''Logica Demonstrativa'' of [[Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri]] (1667\u20131733).\n\n==Traditional logic==\n\n===The textbook tradition===\n[[File:Fennerartoflogic-small.jpg|alt=Frontispiece, with title beginning \"The Artes of Logike and Rethorike, plainlie set foorth in the English tounge, easie to be learned and practised\".|thumb|[[Dudley Fenner]]'s ''Art of Logic'' (1584)]]\n''Traditional logic'' generally means the textbook tradition that begins with [[Antoine Arnauld]]'s and [[Pierre Nicole]]'s ''Logic, or the Art of Thinking'', better known as the ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]''.<ref>''Oxford Companion'' p. 504, article \"Traditional logic\"</ref> Published in 1662, it was the most influential work on logic after Aristotle until the nineteenth century.<ref name=\"Buroker xxiii\">Buroker xxiii</ref> The book presents a loosely Cartesian doctrine (that the proposition is a combining of ideas rather than terms, for example) within a framework that is broadly derived from Aristotelian and medieval [[term logic]].

The account of [[proposition]]s that [[John Locke|Locke]] gives in the ''Essay'' is essentially that of the Port-Royal:  \"Verbal propositions, which are words, [are] the signs of our ideas, put together or separated in affirmative or negative sentences. So that proposition consists in the putting together or separating these signs, according as the things which they stand for agree or disagree.\"<ref>(Locke, ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', IV. 5. 6)</ref>\n\n[[Dudley Fenner]] helped popularize [[Ramist]] logic, a reaction against Aristotle. Another influential work was the ''[[Novum Organum]]'' by [[Francis Bacon]], published in 1620. The title translates as \"new instrument\". This is a reference to [[Aristotle]]'s work known as the ''[[Organon]]''. In this work, Bacon rejects the syllogistic method of Aristotle in favor of an alternative procedure \"which by slow and faithful toil gathers information from things and brings it into understanding\".<ref>Farrington, 1964, 89</ref> This method is known as [[inductive reasoning]], a method which starts from empirical observation and proceeds to lower axioms or propositions; from these lower axioms, more general ones can be induced. For example, in finding the cause of a ''phenomenal nature'' such as heat, 3 lists should be constructed:\n* The presence list: a list of every situation where heat is found.\n* The absence list: a list of every situation that is similar to at least one of those of the presence list, except for the lack of heat.\n* The variability list: a list of every situation where heat can vary.\nThen, the ''form nature'' (or cause) of heat may be defined as that which is common to every situation of the presence list, and which is lacking from every situation of the absence list, and which varies by degree in every situation of the variability list.\n\nOther works in the textbook tradition include [[Isaac Watts]]'s ''Logick: Or, the Right Use of Reason'' (1725), [[Richard Whately]]'s ''Logic'' (1826), and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''A System of Logic'' (1843).  Although the latter was one of the last great works in the tradition, Mill's view that the foundations of logic lie in introspection<ref>N. Abbagnano, \"Psychologism\" in P. Edwards (ed) ''The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', MacMillan, 1967</ref>  influenced the view that logic is best understood as a branch of psychology, a view which dominated the next fifty years of its development, especially in Germany.<ref>Of the German literature in this period, Robert Adamson wrote \"''Logics'' swarm as bees in springtime...\"; Robert Adamson, ''A Short History of Logic'', Wm. Blackwood & Sons, 1911, page 242</ref>\n\n===Logic in Hegel's philosophy===\n[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]\n[[G.W.F. Hegel]] indicated the importance of logic to his philosophical system when he condensed his extensive ''[[Science of Logic]]'' into a shorter work published in 1817 as the first volume of his ''Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences.''  The \"Shorter\" or \"Encyclopaedia\" ''Logic'', as it is often known, lays out a series of transitions which leads from the most empty and abstract of categories\u2014Hegel begins with \"Pure Being\" and \"Pure Nothing\"\u2014to the \"[[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]\", the category which contains and resolves all the categories which preceded it.  Despite the title, Hegel's ''Logic'' is not really a contribution to the science of valid inference.  Rather than deriving conclusions about concepts through valid inference from premises, Hegel seeks to show that thinking about one concept compels thinking about another concept (one cannot, he argues, possess the concept of \"Quality\" without the concept of \"Quantity\"); this compulsion is, supposedly, not a matter of individual psychology, because it arises almost organically from the content of the concepts themselves.  His purpose is to show the rational structure of the \"Absolute\"\u2014indeed of rationality itself.  The method by which thought is driven from one concept to its contrary, and then to further concepts, is known as the Hegelian [[dialectic]].\n\nAlthough Hegel's ''Logic'' has had little impact on mainstream logical studies, its influence can be seen elsewhere:\n* [[Karl von Prantl|Carl von Prantl]]'s ''Geschichte der Logik in Abendland'' (1855\u20131867).<ref>Carl von Prantl (1855-1867), ''Geschichte von Logik in Abendland'', Leipsig:  S. Hirzl, anastatically reprinted in 1997, Hildesheim:  Georg Olds.</ref>\n* The work of the [[British Idealism|British Idealists]], such as F.H. Bradley's ''Principles of Logic'' (1883).\n* The economic, political, and philosophical studies of [[Karl Marx]], and in the various schools of [[Marxism]].\n\n===Logic and psychology===\nBetween the work of Mill and Frege stretched half a century during which logic was widely treated as a descriptive science, an empirical study of the structure of reasoning, and thus essentially as a branch of [[psychology]].<ref>See e.g. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism Psychologism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref>  The German psychologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]], for example, discussed deriving \"the logical from the psychological laws of thought\", emphasizing that \"psychological thinking is always the more comprehensive form of thinking.\"<ref>Wilhelm Wundt, ''Logik'' (1880\u20131883); quoted in Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, pp. 115\u2013116.</ref>  This view was widespread among German philosophers of the period:\n* [[Theodor Lipps]] described logic as \"a specific discipline of psychology\".<ref>Theodor Lipps, ''Grundz\u00fcge der Logik'' (1893); quoted in Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. 40</ref>\n* [[Christoph von Sigwart]] understood logical necessity as grounded in the individual's compulsion to think in a certain way.<ref>Christoph von Sigwart, ''Logik'' (1873\u201378); quoted in Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. 51</ref>\n* [[Benno Erdmann]] argued that \"logical laws only hold within the limits of our thinking\".<ref>Benno Erdmann, ''Logik'' (1892); quoted in Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. 96</ref>\nSuch was the dominant view of logic in the years following Mill's work.<ref>Dermot Moran, \"Introduction\"; Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. xxi</ref>  This psychological approach to logic was rejected by [[Gottlob Frege]].  It was also subjected to an extended and destructive critique by [[Edmund Husserl]] in the first volume of his ''Logical Investigations'' (1900), an assault which has been described as \"overwhelming\".<ref>Michael Dummett, \"Preface\"; Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. xvii</ref>  Husserl argued forcefully that grounding logic in psychological observations implied that all logical truths remained unproven, and that [[skepticism]] and [[relativism]] were unavoidable consequences.\n\nSuch criticisms did not immediately extirpate what is called \"[[psychologism]]\". For example, the American philosopher [[Josiah Royce]], while acknowledging the force of Husserl's critique, remained \"unable to doubt\" that progress in psychology would be accompanied by progress in logic, and vice versa.<ref>Josiah Royce, \"Recent Logical Enquiries and their Psychological Bearings\" (1902) in John J. McDermott (ed) ''The Basic Writings of Josiah Royce'' Volume 2, Fordham University Press, 2005, p. 661</ref>\n\n==Rise of modern logic==\nThe period between the fourteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century had been largely one of decline and neglect, and is generally regarded as barren by historians of logic.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  The revival of logic occurred in the mid-nineteenth century, at the beginning of a revolutionary period where the subject developed into a rigorous and formalistic discipline whose exemplar was the exact method of proof used in [[mathematics]]. The development of the modern \"symbolic\" or \"mathematical\" logic during this period is the most significant in the 2000-year history of logic, and is arguably one of the most important and remarkable events in human intellectual history.<ref name=\"Oxford Companion p. 500\"/>\n\nA number of features distinguish modern logic from the old Aristotelian or traditional logic, the most important of which are as follows:<ref>Bochenski, p. 266</ref>  Modern logic is fundamentally a ''calculus''  whose rules of operation are determined only by the ''shape'' and not by the ''meaning'' of the symbols it employs, as in mathematics.  Many logicians were impressed by the \"success\" of mathematics, in that there had been no prolonged dispute about any truly mathematical result. [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]] noted<ref>Peirce 1896</ref> that even though a mistake in the evaluation of a definite integral by [[Laplace]] led to an error concerning the moon's orbit that persisted for nearly 50 years, the mistake, once spotted, was corrected without any serious dispute.  Peirce contrasted this with the disputation and uncertainty surrounding traditional logic, and especially reasoning in [[metaphysics]]. He argued that a truly \"exact\" logic would depend upon mathematical, i.e., \"diagrammatic\" or \"iconic\" thought.  \"Those who follow such methods will ... escape all error except such as will be speedily corrected after it is once suspected\".  Modern logic is also \"constructive\" rather than \"abstractive\"; i.e., rather than abstracting and formalising theorems derived from ordinary language (or from psychological intuitions about validity), it constructs theorems by formal methods, then looks for an interpretation in ordinary language. It is entirely symbolic, meaning that even the logical constants (which the medieval logicians called \"[[Syncategorematic term|syncategoremata]]\") and the categoric terms are expressed in symbols.\n\n==Modern logic==\nThe development of modern logic falls into roughly five periods:<ref>See Bochenski p. 269</ref>\n* The '''embryonic period''' from [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] to 1847, when the notion of a logical calculus was discussed and developed, particularly by Leibniz, but no schools were formed, and isolated periodic attempts were abandoned or went unnoticed.\n* The '''algebraic period''' from [[Boole]]'s Analysis to [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der|Schr\u00f6der]]'s ''Vorlesungen''.  In this period, there were more practitioners, and a greater continuity of development.\n* The '''[[logicist]] period''' from the [[Begriffsschrift]] of [[Frege]] to the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' of [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[A.N. Whitehead|Whitehead]]. The aim of the \"logicist school\" was to incorporate the logic of all mathematical and scientific discourse in a single unified system which, taking as a fundamental principle that all mathematical truths are logical, did not accept any non-logical terminology.  The major logicists were [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], and the early [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]].<ref>''Oxford Companion'' p. 499</ref> It culminates with the ''Principia'', an important work which includes a thorough examination and attempted solution of the [[antinomy|antinomies]] which had been an obstacle to earlier progress.\n* The '''metamathematical period''' from 1910 to the 1930s, which saw the development of [[metalogic]], in the [[finitist]] system of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], and the non-finitist system of [[Leopold L\u00f6wenheim|L\u00f6wenheim]] and [[Skolem]], the combination of logic and metalogic in the work of [[G\u00f6del]] and [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]].  G\u00f6del's [[incompleteness theorem]] of 1931 was one of the greatest achievements in the history of logic.  Later in the 1930s, G\u00f6del developed the notion of [[set-theoretic constructibility]].\n* The '''period after World War II''', when [[mathematical logic]] branched into four inter-related but separate areas of research: [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], [[computability theory]], and [[set theory]], and its ideas and methods began to influence [[philosophy]].\n\n===Embryonic period===\n[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|upright|Leibniz]]\nThe idea that inference could be represented by a purely mechanical process is found as early as [[Ramon Llull|Raymond Llull]], who proposed a (somewhat eccentric) method of drawing conclusions by a system of concentric rings.  The work of logicians such as the [[Oxford Calculators]]<ref>Edith Sylla (1999), \"Oxford Calculators\", in ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', Cambridge, Cambridgeshire:  Cambridge.</ref> led to a method of using letters instead of writing out logical calculations (''calculationes'') in words, a method used, for instance, in the ''Logica magna'' by [[Paul of Venice]].  Three hundred years after Llull, the English philosopher and logician [[Thomas Hobbes]] suggested that all logic and reasoning could be reduced to the mathematical operations of addition and subtraction.<ref>El. philos. sect. I de corp 1.1.2.</ref> The same idea is found in the work of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], who had read both Llull and Hobbes, and who argued that logic can be represented through a combinatorial process or calculus.  But, like Llull and Hobbes, he failed to develop a detailed or comprehensive system, and his work on this topic was not published until long after his death. Leibniz says that ordinary languages are subject to \"countless ambiguities\" and are unsuited for a calculus, whose task is to expose mistakes in inference arising from the forms and structures of words;<ref>Bochenski p. 274</ref> hence, he proposed to identify an [[alphabet of human thought]] comprising fundamental concepts which could be composed to express complex ideas,<ref>Rutherford, Donald, 1995, \"Philosophy and language\" in Jolley, N., ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz''. Cambridge Univ. Press.</ref> and create a ''[[calculus ratiocinator]]'' that would make all arguments \"as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate.\"<ref>Wiener, Philip, 1951. ''Leibniz: Selections''. Scribner.</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Diaz Gergonne|Gergonne]] (1816) said that reasoning does not have to be about objects about which one has perfectly clear ideas, because algebraic operations can be carried out without having any idea of the meaning of the symbols involved.<ref>''Essai de dialectique rationelle'', 211n, quoted in Bochenski p. 277.</ref> [[Bernard Bolzano|Bolzano]] anticipated a fundamental idea of modern proof theory when he defined logical consequence or \"deducibility\" in terms of variables:<ref>{{cite book\n| title=The Theory of Science: Die Wissenschaftslehre oder Versuch einer Neuen Darstellung der Logik\n| last=Bolzano\n| first=Bernard\n| editor-last=George\n| editor-first=Rolf\n| others=Translated by George Rolf\n| publisher=[[University of California Press]]\n| date=1972\n| isbn=9780520017870\n| page=209\n| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oA1NDDirneQC&lpg=PA209&dq=%22deducible%20from%20propositions%22&pg=PA209#v=onepage&q=%22deducible%20from%20propositions%22&f=false\n}}</ref><blockquote>Hence I say that propositions <math>M</math>, <math>N</math>, <math>O</math>,&hellip; are ''deducible'' from propositions <math>A</math>, <math>B</math>, <math>C</math>, <math>D</math>,&hellip; with respect to variable parts <math>i</math>, <math>j</math>,&hellip;, if every class of ideas whose substitution for <math>i</math>, <math>j</math>,&hellip; makes all of <math>A</math>, <math>B</math>, <math>C</math>, <math>D</math>,&hellip; true, also makes all of <math>M</math>, <math>N</math>, <math>O</math>,&hellip; true.

The school begins with Boole's seminal work ''Mathematical Analysis of Logic'' which appeared in 1847, although [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] (1847) is its immediate precursor.<ref>Before publishing, he wrote to [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]], who was just finishing his work ''Formal Logic''.  De Morgan suggested they should publish first, and thus the two books appeared at the same time, possibly even reaching the bookshops on the same day. cf. Kneale p. 404</ref> The fundamental idea of Boole's system is that algebraic formulae can be used to express logical relations.  This idea occurred to Boole in his teenage years, working as an usher in a private school in [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire]].<ref>Kneale p. 404</ref>  For example, let x and y stand for classes let the symbol ''='' signify that the classes have the same members, xy stand for the class containing all and only the members of x and y and so on.  Boole calls these ''elective symbols'', i.e. symbols which select certain objects for consideration.<ref name=\"Kneale p. 407\">Kneale p. 407</ref>  An expression in which elective symbols are used is called an ''elective function'', and an equation of which the members are elective functions, is an ''elective equation''.<ref>Boole (1847) p. 16</ref> The theory of elective functions and their \"development\" is essentially the modern idea of [[truth-function]]s and their expression in [[disjunctive normal form]].<ref name=\"Kneale p. 407\"/>\n\nBoole's system admits of two interpretations, in class logic, and propositional logic.  Boole distinguished between \"primary propositions\" which are the subject of syllogistic theory, and \"secondary propositions\", which are the subject of propositional logic, and showed how under different \"interpretations\" the same algebraic system could represent both. An example of a primary proposition is \"All inhabitants are either Europeans or Asiatics.\"  An example of a secondary proposition is \"Either all inhabitants are Europeans or they are all Asiatics.\"<ref>Boole 1847 pp. 58\u20139</ref>  These are easily distinguished in modern propositional calculus, where it is also possible to show that the first follows from the second, but it is a significant disadvantage that there is no way of representing this in the Boolean system.<ref>Beaney p. 11</ref>\n\nIn his ''Symbolic Logic'' (1881), [[John Venn]] used diagrams of overlapping areas to express Boolean relations between classes or truth-conditions of propositions. In 1869 Jevons realised that Boole's methods could be mechanised, and constructed a \"logical machine\" which he showed to the [[Royal Society]] the following year.<ref name=\"Kneale p. 407\"/>  In 1885 [[Allan Marquand]] proposed an electrical version of the machine that is still extant ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080908073359/http://finelib.princeton.edu/instruction/wri172_demonstration.php picture at the Firestone Library]).\n[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce.jpg|left|thumb|160px|Charles Sanders Peirce]]\nThe defects in Boole's system (such as the use of the letter ''v'' for existential propositions) were all remedied by his followers.  Jevons published ''Pure Logic, or the Logic of Quality apart from Quantity'' in 1864, where he suggested a symbol to signify [[exclusive or]], which allowed Boole's system to be greatly simplified.<ref>Kneale p. 422</ref>  This was usefully exploited by Schr\u00f6der when he set out theorems in parallel columns in his ''Vorlesungen'' (1890\u20131905).  Peirce (1880) showed how all the Boolean elective functions could be expressed by the use of a single primitive binary operation, \"[[Logical NOR|neither ... nor ...]]\" and equally well \"[[Sheffer stroke|not both ... and ...]]\",<ref>Peirce, \"A Boolean Algebra with One Constant\", 1880 MS, ''Collected Papers'' v. 4, paragraphs 12\u201320, reprinted ''Writings'' v. 4, pp. 218-21. Google [https://archive.org/details/writingsofcharle0002peir <!-- quote=378 Winter. --> Preview].</ref> however, like many of Peirce's innovations, this remained unknown or unnoticed until [[Henry M. Sheffer|Sheffer]] rediscovered it in 1913.<ref>''Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., xiv (1913)'', pp. 481\u20138. This is now known as the [[Sheffer stroke]]</ref>  Boole's early work also lacks the idea of the [[logical sum]] which originates in Peirce (1867), [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der|Schr\u00f6der]] (1877) and Jevons (1890),<ref>Bochenski 296</ref> and the concept of [[Inclusion (logic)|inclusion]], first suggested by Gergonne (1816) and clearly articulated by Peirce (1870).\n[[File:Boolean multiples of 2 3 5.svg|alt=Coloured diagram of 4 interlocking sets|right|thumb|250px|Boolean multiples]]\nThe success of Boole's algebraic system suggested that all logic must be capable of algebraic representation, and there were attempts to express a logic of relations in such form, of which the most ambitious was Schr\u00f6der's monumental ''Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik'' (\"Lectures on the Algebra of Logic\", vol iii 1895), although the original idea was again anticipated by Peirce.<ref>See CP III</ref>\n\nBoole's unwavering acceptance of Aristotle's logic is emphasized by the historian of logic [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]] in an accessible introduction to ''Laws of Thought''<ref>[[George Boole]]. 1854/2003. The Laws of Thought, facsimile of 1854 edition, with an introduction by J. Corcoran. Buffalo: Prometheus Books (2003). Reviewed by James van Evra in Philosophy in Review.24 (2004) 167\u2013169.</ref> Corcoran also wrote a point-by-point comparison of ''Prior Analytics'' and ''Laws of Thought''.<ref>JOHN CORCORAN, Aristotle's Prior Analytics and Boole's Laws of Thought, History and Philosophy of Logic, vol. 24 (2003), pp. 261\u2013288.</ref> According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle's logic. Boole's goals were \"to go under, over, and beyond\" Aristotle's logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations, 2) extending the class of problems it could treat \u2014 from assessing validity to solving equations \u2014 and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle \u2014 e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.\n\nMore specifically, Boole agreed with what [[Aristotle]] said; Boole's 'disagreements', if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. \nFirst, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced the four propositional forms of Aristotelian logic to formulas in the form of equations \u2014 by itself a revolutionary idea. \nSecond, in the realm of logic's problems, Boole's addition of equation solving to logic \u2014 another revolutionary idea \u2014 involved Boole's doctrine that Aristotle's rules of inference (the \"perfect syllogisms\") must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. \nThird, in the realm of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce \"No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus\" from \"No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle\" or from \"No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle\".\n\n===Logicist period===\n[[File:Young frege.jpg|thumb|160px|Gottlob Frege.]]\nAfter Boole, the next great advances were made by the German mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]]. Frege's objective was the program of [[Logicism]], i.e. demonstrating that arithmetic is identical with logic.<ref name=k435>Kneale p. 435</ref>  Frege went much further than any of his predecessors in his rigorous and formal approach to logic, and his calculus or [[Begriffsschrift]] is important.<ref name=k435/> Frege also tried to show that the concept of [[number]] can be defined by purely logical means, so that (if he was right) logic includes arithmetic and all branches of mathematics that are reducible to arithmetic.  He was not the first writer to suggest this.  In his pioneering work ''Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik'' (The Foundations of Arithmetic), sections 15\u201317, he acknowledges the efforts of Leibniz, [[J.S. Mill]] as well as Jevons, citing the latter's claim that \"algebra is a highly developed logic, and number but logical discrimination.\"<ref>Jevons, ''The Principles of Science'', London 1879, p. 156, quoted in ''Grundlagen'' 15</ref>\n\nFrege's first work, the ''Begriffsschrift'' (\"concept script\") is a rigorously axiomatised system of propositional logic, relying on just two connectives (negational and conditional), two rules of inference (''modus ponens'' and substitution), and six axioms.  Frege referred to the \"completeness\" of this system, but was unable to prove this.<ref>Beaney p. 10 \u2013 the completeness of Frege's system was eventually proved by [[Jan \u0141ukasiewicz]] in 1934</ref>  The most significant innovation, however, was his explanation of the [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] in terms of mathematical functions.  Traditional logic regards the sentence \"Caesar is a man\" as of fundamentally the same form as \"all men are mortal.\"  Sentences with a proper name subject were regarded as universal in character, interpretable as \"every Caesar is a man\".<ref>See for example the argument by the medieval logician [[William of Ockham]] that singular propositions are universal, in [[Summa Logicae]] III. 8 (??)</ref>  At the outset Frege abandons the traditional \"concepts ''subject'' and ''predicate''\", replacing them with ''argument'' and ''function'' respectively, which he believes \"will stand the test of time. It is easy to see how regarding a content as a function of an argument leads to the formation of concepts. Furthermore, the demonstration of the connection between the meanings of the words ''if, and, not, or, there is, some, all,'' and so forth, deserves attention\".<ref>{{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=7}}</ref> Frege argued that the quantifier expression \"all men\" does not have the same logical or semantic form as \"all men\", and that the universal proposition \"every A is B\" is a complex proposition involving two ''functions'', namely ' \u2013 is A' and ' \u2013 is B' such that whatever satisfies the first, also satisfies the second.  In modern notation, this would be expressed as\n\n: <math>\\forall \\; x \\big( A(x) \\rightarrow B (x) \\big)</math>\n\nIn English, \"for all x, if Ax then Bx\".  Thus only singular propositions are of subject-predicate form, and they are irreducibly singular, i.e. not reducible to a general proposition.  Universal and particular propositions, by contrast, are not of simple subject-predicate form at all.  If \"all mammals\" were the logical subject of the sentence \"all mammals are land-dwellers\", then to negate the whole sentence we would have to negate the predicate to give \"all mammals are ''not'' land-dwellers\".  But this is not the case.<ref>\"On concept and object\" p. 198; Geach p. 48</ref>  This functional analysis of ordinary-language sentences later had a great impact on philosophy and [[linguistics]].\n\nThis means that in Frege's calculus, Boole's \"primary\" propositions can be represented in a different way from \"secondary\" propositions.  \"All inhabitants are either men or women\" is\n[[File:BS-13-Begriffsschrift Quantifier2-svg.svg|130px|alt=Straight line with bend; text \"x\" over bend; text \"F(x)\" to the right of the line.|thumb|[[Frege]]'s \"Concept Script\"]]\n: <math>\\forall \\; x \\Big( I(x) \\rightarrow \\big( M(x) \\lor W(x) \\big) \\Big) </math>\n\nwhereas \"All the inhabitants are men or all the inhabitants are women\" is\n\n: <math>\\forall \\; x \\big( I(x) \\rightarrow M(x) \\big) \\lor \\forall \\;x \\big( I(x) \\rightarrow W(x) \\big)</math>\n\nAs Frege remarked in a critique of Boole's calculus:\n\n: \"The real difference is that I avoid [the Boolean] division into two parts ... and give a homogeneous presentation of the lot.  In Boole the two parts run alongside one another, so that one is like the mirror image of the other, but for that very reason stands in no organic relation to it'<ref>BLC p. 14, quoted in Beaney p. 12</ref>\n\nAs well as providing a unified and comprehensive system of logic, Frege's calculus also resolved the ancient [[problem of multiple generality]].  The ambiguity of \"every girl kissed a boy\" is difficult to express in traditional logic, but Frege's logic resolves this through the different scope of the quantifiers.  Thus\n\n:<math>\\forall \\; x \\Big( G(x) \\rightarrow  \\exists \\; y \\big( B(y) \\land K(x,y) \\big) \\Big)</math>\n[[File:Giuseppe_Peano.jpg|thumb|120px|Peano]]\nmeans that to every girl there corresponds some boy (any one will do) who the girl kissed. But\n\n:<math>\\exists \\;x \\Big( B(x) \\land \\forall \\;y \\big( G(y) \\rightarrow K(y, x) \\big) \\Big)</math>\n\nmeans that there is some particular boy whom every girl kissed. Without this device, the project of logicism would have been doubtful or impossible.  Using it, Frege provided a definition of the [[ancestral relation]], of the [[Injective function|many-to-one relation]], and of [[mathematical induction]].<ref>See e.g. [http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/f/frege.htm The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy], article \"Frege\"</ref>\n[[File:Ernst Zermelo 1900s.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Ernst Zermelo]]\nThis period overlaps with the work of what is known as the \"mathematical school\", which included [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]], [[Moritz Pasch|Pasch]], [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Ernst Zermelo|Zermelo]], [[Edward Vermilye Huntington|Huntington]], [[Oswald Veblen|Veblen]] and [[Arend Heyting|Heyting]]. Their objective was the axiomatisation of branches of mathematics like geometry, arithmetic, analysis and set theory. Most notable was [[Hilbert's Program]], which sought to ground all of mathematics to a finite set of axioms, proving its consistency by \"finitistic\" means and providing a procedure which would decide the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement. The standard [[axiomatization]] of the [[natural number]]s is named the [[Peano axioms]] eponymously. Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols. While unaware of Frege's work, he independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of Boole and Schr\u00f6der.<ref>Van Heijenoort 1967, p. 83</ref>\n\nThe logicist project received a near-fatal setback with the discovery of a paradox in 1901 by [[Bertrand Russell]].  This proved Frege's [[naive set theory]] led to a contradiction.  Frege's theory contained the axiom that for any formal criterion, there is a set of all objects that meet the criterion.  Russell showed that a set containing exactly the sets that are not members of themselves would contradict its own definition (if it is not a member of itself, it is a member of itself, and if it is a member of itself, it is not).<ref>See e.g. Potter 2004</ref> This contradiction is now known as [[Russell's paradox]]. One important method of resolving this paradox was proposed by [[Ernst Zermelo]].<ref>Zermelo 1908</ref> [[Zermelo set theory]] was the first [[axiomatic set theory]]. It was developed into the now-canonical [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF). Russell's paradox symbolically is as follows:\n\n:<math>\\text{Let } R = \\{ x \\mid x \\not \\in x \\} \\text{, then } R \\in R \\iff R \\not \\in R</math>\nThe monumental [[Principia Mathematica]], a three-volume work on the [[foundations of mathematics]], written by Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and published 1910\u201313 also included an attempt to resolve the paradox, by means of an elaborate [[system of types]]: a set of elements is of a different type than is each of its elements (set is not the element; one element is not the set) and one cannot speak of the \"[[set of all sets]]\".  The ''Principia'' was an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a well-defined set of [[axiom]]s and [[inference rule]]s in [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]].\n\n===Metamathematical period===\n[[File:Kurt g\u00f6del.jpg|thumb|130px|right|Kurt G\u00f6del]]\nThe names of [[Kurt G\u00f6del|G\u00f6del]] and [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] dominate the 1930s,<ref>Feferman 1999 p. 1</ref> a crucial period in the development of [[metamathematics]] \u2013 the study of mathematics using mathematical methods to produce [[metatheory|metatheories]], or mathematical theories about other mathematical theories.  Early investigations into metamathematics had been driven by Hilbert's program. Work on metamathematics culminated in the work of G\u00f6del, who in 1929 showed that a given [[first-order logic|first-order sentence]] is [[Provability logic|deducible]] if and only if it is logically valid \u2013 i.e. it is true in every [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] for its language.  This is known as [[G\u00f6del's completeness theorem]].  A year later, he proved two important theorems, which showed Hibert's program to be unattainable in its original form.  The first is that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an [[Effective method|effective procedure]] such as an [[algorithm]] or computer program is capable of proving all facts about the [[natural number]]s.  For any such system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second is that if such a system is also capable of proving certain basic facts about the natural numbers, then the system cannot prove the consistency of the system itself.  These two results are known as [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]], or simply ''G\u00f6del's Theorem''.  Later in the decade, G\u00f6del developed the concept of [[set-theoretic constructibility]], as part of his proof that the [[axiom of choice]] and the [[continuum hypothesis]] are consistent with [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]].\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Alonzo Church.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Alonzo Church]] -->\nIn [[proof theory]], [[Gerhard Gentzen]] developed [[natural deduction]] and the [[sequent calculus]].  The former attempts to model logical reasoning as it 'naturally' occurs in practice and is most easily applied to intuitionistic logic, while the latter was devised to clarify the derivation of logical proofs in any formal system.  Since Gentzen's work, natural deduction and sequent calculi have been widely applied in the fields of proof theory, mathematical logic and computer science.  Gentzen also proved normalization and cut-elimination theorems for intuitionistic and classical logic which could be used to reduce logical proofs to a normal form.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jean-Yves | last=Girard | authorlink=Jean-Yves Girard | author2=Paul Taylor | author3=Yves Lafont | title=Proofs and Types | publisher=Cambridge University Press (Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science, 7) | year=1990 | origyear=1989 | isbn=0-521-37181-3 | url=https://archive.org/details/proofstypes0000gira | url-access=registration }}</ref><ref>{{MathWorld | urlname=CutEliminationTheorem | title=Cut Elimination Theorem | author=Alex Sakharov}}</ref>\n[[File:AlfredTarski1968.jpeg|right|200px|alt=Balding man, with bookshelf in background|thumb|Alfred Tarski]]\n[[Alfred Tarski]], a pupil of [[Jan \u0141ukasiewicz|\u0141ukasiewicz]], is best known for his definition of truth and [[logical consequence]], and the semantic concept of [[Open sentence|logical satisfaction]].  In 1933, he published (in Polish) ''The concept of truth in formalized languages'', in which he proposed his [[semantic theory of truth]]: a sentence such as \"snow is white\" is true if and only if snow is white.  Tarski's theory separated the [[metalanguage]], which makes the statement about truth, from the [[object language]], which contains the sentence whose truth is being asserted, and gave a correspondence (the [[T-schema]]) between phrases in the object language and elements of an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]].  Tarski's approach to the difficult idea of explaining truth has been enduringly influential in logic and philosophy, especially in the development of [[model theory]].<ref>Feferman and Feferman 2004, p. 122, discussing \"The Impact of Tarski's Theory of Truth\".</ref>  Tarski also produced important work on the methodology of deductive systems, and on fundamental principles such as [[completeness (logic)|completeness]], [[decidability (logic)|decidability]], [[consistency]] and [[Structure (mathematical logic)|definability]]. According to Anita Feferman, Tarski \"changed the face of logic in the twentieth century\".<ref>Feferman 1999, p. 1</ref>\n\n[[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] proposed formal models of computability, giving independent negative solutions to Hilbert's ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' in 1936 and 1937, respectively. The ''Entscheidungsproblem'' asked for a procedure that, given any formal mathematical statement, would algorithmically determine whether the statement is true.  Church and Turing proved there is no such procedure; Turing's paper introduced the [[halting problem]] as a key example of a mathematical problem without an algorithmic solution.\n\nChurch's system for computation developed into the modern [[\u03bb-calculus]], while the [[Turing machine]] became a standard model for a general-purpose computing device. It was soon shown that many other proposed models of computation were equivalent in power to those proposed by Church and Turing. These results led to the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]] that any deterministic [[algorithm]] that can be carried out by a human can be carried out by a Turing machine. Church proved additional undecidability results, showing that both [[Peano arithmetic]] and [[first-order logic]] are [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]]. Later work by [[Emil Post]] and [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] in the 1940s extended the scope of computability theory and introduced the concept of [[degrees of unsolvability]].\n\nThe results of the first few decades of the twentieth century also had an impact upon [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophical logic]], particularly from the 1950s onwards, in subjects such as [[modal logic]], [[temporal logic]], [[deontic logic]], and [[relevance logic]].\n\n===Logic after WWII===\n[[File:Kripke.JPG|alt=Man with a beard and straw hat on a beach|thumb|[[Saul Kripke]]]]\n\nAfter World War II, [[mathematical logic]] branched into four inter-related but separate areas of research: [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], [[computability theory]], and [[set theory]].<ref>See e.g. Barwise, ''Handbook of Mathematical Logic''</ref>\n\nIn set theory, the method of [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] revolutionized the field by providing a robust method for constructing models and obtaining independence results. <!-- Kunen p. 235ff, Kanamori p. 114ff --> [[Paul Cohen]] introduced this method in 1963 to prove the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]] and the [[axiom of choice]] from [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/72252 The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis, II]  Paul J. Cohen Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 51, No. 1. (Jan. 15, 1964), pp. 105-110.\n</ref> His technique, which was simplified and extended soon after its introduction, has since been applied to many other problems in all areas of mathematical logic.\n\nComputability theory had its roots in the work of Turing, Church, Kleene, and Post in the 1930s and 40s. It developed into a study of abstract computability, which became known as [[recursion theory]].<ref>Many of the foundational papers are collected in ''The Undecidable'' (1965) edited by Martin Davis</ref>  The [[Turing degree|priority method]], discovered independently by [[Albert Muchnik]] and [[Richard Friedberg]] in the 1950s, led to major advances in the understanding of the [[degrees of unsolvability]] and related structures. <!-- cooper 246 -->  Research into higher-order computability theory demonstrated its connections to set theory. <!-- sacks \"higher recursion theory\" -->  The fields of [[constructive analysis]] and [[computable analysis]] were developed to study the effective content of classical mathematical theorems; these in turn inspired the program of [[reverse mathematics]].  A separate branch of computability theory, [[computational complexity theory]], was also characterized in logical terms as a result of investigations into [[descriptive complexity]].\n\nModel theory applies the methods of mathematical logic to study models of particular mathematical theories. Alfred Tarski published much pioneering work in the field, which is named after a series of papers he published under the title ''Contributions to the theory of models''. <!-- \"alfred tarski's work in model theory\", vaught, JSL, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2273900 --> In the 1960s, [[Abraham Robinson]] used model-theoretic techniques to develop calculus and analysis based on [[non-standard analysis|infinitesimals]], a problem that first had been proposed by Leibniz. <!-- Keisler, fundamentals of model theory, HML, p. 48 -->\n\nIn proof theory, the relationship between classical mathematics and intuitionistic mathematics was clarified via tools such as the [[realizability]] method invented by [[Georg Kreisel]] and G\u00f6del's [[Dialectica interpretation|''Dialectica'' interpretation]]. This work inspired the contemporary area of [[proof mining]]. The [[Curry\u2013Howard correspondence]] emerged as a deep analogy between logic and computation, including a correspondence between systems of natural deduction and [[typed lambda calculus|typed lambda calculi]] used in computer science.  As a result, research into this class of formal systems began to address both logical and computational aspects; this area of research came to be known as modern type theory.  Advances were also made in [[ordinal analysis]] and the study of independence results in arithmetic such as the [[Paris\u2013Harrington theorem]].\n\nThis was also a period, particularly in the 1950s and afterwards, when the ideas of mathematical logic begin to influence philosophical thinking.  For example, [[tense logic]] is a formalised system for representing, and reasoning about, propositions qualified in terms of time. The philosopher [[Arthur Prior]] played a significant role in its development in the 1960s. [[Modal logic]]s extend the scope of formal logic to include the elements of [[Linguistic modality|modality]] (for example, [[Logical possibility|possibility]] and [[Necessary and sufficient conditions#Necessary conditions|necessity]]). The ideas of [[Saul Kripke]], particularly about [[possible world]]s, and the formal system now called [[Kripke semantics]] have had a profound impact on [[analytic philosophy]].<ref>Jerry Fodor, \"[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n20/jerry-fodor/waters-water-everywhere Water's water everywhere]\", ''London Review of Books'', 21 October 2004</ref> His best known and most influential work is ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' (1980).<ref>See ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century: Volume 2: The Age of Meaning'', Scott Soames: \"''Naming and Necessity'' is among the most important works ever, ranking with the classical work of Frege in the late nineteenth century, and of Russell, Tarski and Wittgenstein in the first half of the twentieth century\".

[[Nagarjuna]] (c. 150-250 AD), the founder of the [[Madhyamika]] (\"Middle Way\") developed an analysis known as the [[catu\u1e63ko\u1e6di]] (Sanskrit), a \"four-cornered\" system of argumentation that involves the systematic examination and rejection of each of the 4 possibilities of a proposition, ''P'':\n# ''P''; that is, being.\n# not&nbsp;''P''; that is, not being.\n# ''P'' and not&nbsp;''P''; that is, being and not being.\n# not (''P'' or not&nbsp;''P''); that is, neither being nor not being.{{Paragraph break}}Under [[propositional logic]], [[De Morgan's laws]] imply that this is equivalent to the third case (''P'' and not&nbsp;''P''), and is therefore superfluous; there are actually only 3 cases to consider.\n\nHowever, [[Dignaga]] (c 480-540 AD) is sometimes said to have developed a formal syllogism,<ref>Bochenski pp. 431\u20137</ref> and it was through him and his successor, [[Dharmakirti]], that [[Buddhist logic]] reached its height; it is contested whether their analysis actually constitutes a formal syllogistic system. In particular, their analysis centered on the definition of an inference-warranting relation, \"[[vyapti]]\", also known as invariable concomitance or pervasion.<ref name=Matilal>{{cite book|last=Matilal|first=Bimal Krishna|title=The Character of Logic in India|year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=9780791437407|pages=12, 18}}</ref> To this end, a doctrine known as \"apoha\" or differentiation was developed.<ref>Bochenksi p. 441</ref> This involved what might be called inclusion and exclusion of defining properties.\n\nDign\u0101ga's famous \"wheel of reason\" (''[[Hetucakra]]'') is a method of indicating when one thing (such as smoke) can be taken as an invariable sign of another thing (like fire), but the inference is often inductive and based on past observation. Matilal remarks that Dign\u0101ga's analysis is much like John Stuart Mill's Joint Method of Agreement and Difference, which is inductive.<ref>Matilal, 17</ref>\n\nIn addition, the traditional five-member Indian syllogism, though deductively valid, has repetitions that are unnecessary to its logical validity. As a result, some commentators see the traditional Indian syllogism as a rhetorical form that is entirely natural in many cultures of the world, and yet not as a logical form\u2014not in the sense that all logically unnecessary elements have been omitted for the sake of analysis.\n\n===Logic in China===\n{{Main|Logic in China}}\nIn China, a contemporary of [[Confucius]], [[Mozi]], \"Master Mo\", is credited with founding the [[Mohism|Mohist school]], whose canons dealt with issues relating to valid inference and the conditions of correct conclusions. In particular, one of the schools that grew out of Mohism, the [[School of Names|Logicians]], are credited by some scholars for their early investigation of [[formal logic]]. Due to the harsh rule of [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] in the subsequent [[Qin Dynasty]], this line of investigation disappeared in China until the introduction of Indian philosophy by [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].\n\n==Logic in the West==\n\n===Prehistory of logic===\nValid reasoning has been employed in all periods of human history. However, logic studies the ''principles'' of valid reasoning, inference and demonstration. It is probable that the idea of demonstrating a conclusion first arose in connection with [[geometry]], which originally meant the same as \"land measurement\".<ref>Kneale, p. 2</ref> The [[ancient Egypt]]ians discovered [[Egyptian mathematics|geometry]], including the formula for the volume of a [[Frustum|truncated pyramid]].<ref name=Kneale3>Kneale p. 3</ref> [[Babylonian mathematics|Ancient Babylon]] was also skilled in mathematics.

Both [[Thales]] and [[Pythagoras]] of the [[Pre-Socratic philosophers]] seem aware of geometry's methods.\n\nFragments of early proofs are preserved in the works of Plato and Aristotle,<ref>Heath, ''Mathematics in Aristotle'', cited in Kneale, p. 5</ref> and the idea of a deductive system was probably known in the Pythagorean school and the [[Platonic Academy]].<ref name=Kneale3/> The proofs of [[Euclid of Alexandria]] are a paradigm of Greek geometry. The three basic principles of geometry are as follows:\n\n* Certain propositions must be accepted as true without demonstration; such a proposition is known as an [[axiom]] of geometry.\n* Every proposition that is not an axiom of geometry must be demonstrated as following from the axioms of geometry; such a demonstration is known as a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] or a \"derivation\" of the proposition.\n* The proof must be ''formal''; that is, the derivation of the proposition must be independent of the particular subject matter in question.<ref name=Kneale3/>\nFurther evidence that early Greek thinkers were concerned with the principles of reasoning is found in the fragment called ''[[dissoi logoi]]'', probably written at the beginning of the fourth century BC. This is part of a protracted debate about truth and falsity.<ref>Kneale, p. 16</ref> In the case of the classical Greek city-states, interest in argumentation was also stimulated by the activities of the [[Rhetoric]]ians or Orators and the [[Sophists]], who used arguments to defend or attack a thesis, both in legal and political contexts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/346217/history-of-logic#toc65918|title=History of logic|author=|date=|website=britannica.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Thales' Theorem.svg|thumb|130px|left|Thales Theorem]]\n\n====Thales====\nIt is said Thales, most widely regarded as the first philosopher in the [[Greek philosophy|Greek tradition]],<ref>[[Aristotle]], Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.</ref><ref name=\"CPM\">{{cite book|author = Smith|title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year = 1870|url = https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/1016|page = 1016|first = Sir William}}</ref> measured the height of the [[pyramids]] by their shadows at the moment when his own shadow was equal to his height.

(B 7.1\u20138.2)\n\n[[Zeno of Elea]], a pupil of Parmenides, had the idea of a standard argument pattern found in the method of proof known as ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''. This is the technique of drawing an obviously false (that is, \"absurd\") conclusion from an assumption, thus demonstrating that the assumption is false.<ref>Kneale p. 15</ref> Therefore, Zeno and his teacher are seen as the first to apply the art of logic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPoqAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA170&lpg=PA170|title=The Numismatic Circular|author=|date=2 April 2018|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>   Plato's dialogue [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] portrays Zeno as claiming to have written a book defending the [[monism]] of Parmenides by demonstrating the absurd consequence of assuming that there is plurality. Zeno famously used this method to develop his [[Zeno's Paradoxes|paradoxes]] in his arguments against motion. Such ''dialectic'' reasoning later became popular. The members of this school were called \"dialecticians\" (from a Greek word meaning \"to discuss\").\n\n====Plato====\n{{quotation|Let no one ignorant of geometry enter here.|Inscribed over the entrance to Plato's Academy.}}\n[[File:MANNapoli 124545 plato's academy mosaic.jpg|alt=Mosaic: seven men standing under a tree|thumb|200px|[[Plato's Academy mosaic]]]]\nNone of the surviving works of the great fourth-century philosopher [[Plato]] (428\u2013347 BC) include any formal logic,<ref>Kneale p. 17</ref> but they include important contributions to the field of [[philosophical logic]]. Plato raises three questions:\n\n* What is it that can properly be called true or false?\n* What is the nature of the connection between the assumptions of a valid argument and its conclusion?\n* What is the nature of definition?\n\nThe first question arises in the dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', where Plato identifies thought or opinion with talk or discourse (''logos'').<ref>\"forming an opinion is talking, and opinion is speech that is held not with someone else or aloud but in silence with oneself\" ''Theaetetus'' 189E\u2013190A</ref> The second question is a result of Plato's [[theory of Forms]]. Forms are not things in the ordinary sense, nor strictly ideas in the mind, but they correspond to what philosophers later called [[universals]], namely an abstract entity common to each set of things that have the same name. In both the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and the ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', Plato suggests that the necessary connection between the assumptions of a valid argument and its conclusion corresponds to a necessary connection between \"forms\".<ref>Kneale p. 20.  For example, the proof given in the ''Meno'' that the square on the diagonal is double the area of the original square presumably involves the forms of the square and the triangle, and the necessary relation between them</ref> The third question is about [[definition]]. Many of Plato's dialogues concern the search for a definition of some important concept (justice, truth, the Good), and it is likely that Plato was impressed by the importance of definition in mathematics.<ref>Kneale p. 21</ref> What underlies every definition is a Platonic Form, the common nature present in different particular things. Thus, a definition reflects the ultimate object of understanding, and is the foundation of all valid inference. This had a great influence on Plato's student [[Aristotle]], in particular Aristotle's notion of the [[essence]] of a thing.<ref>Zalta, Edward N. \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-logic/#Def Aristotle's Logic]\".

He was the first ''formal logician'', in that he demonstrated the principles of reasoning by employing variables to show the underlying [[logical form]] of an argument. He sought relations of dependence which characterize necessary inference, and distinguished the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of these relations, from the truth of the premises. He was the first to deal with the principles of [[Principle of contradiction|contradiction]] and [[Law of excluded middle|excluded middle]] in a systematic way.<ref name=\"Bochenski p. 63\">Bochenski p. 63</ref> \n[[File:Aristoteles Logica 1570 Biblioteca Huelva.jpg|alt=Front cover of book, titled \"Aristotelis Logica\", with an illustration of eagle on a snake|240px|thumb|left|Aristotle's logic was still influential in the [[Renaissance]]]]\n\n====The Organon====\nHis logical works, called the ''[[Organon]]'', are the earliest formal study of logic that have come down to modern times. Though it is difficult to determine the dates, the probable order of writing of Aristotle's logical works is:\n* ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|The Categories]]'', a study of the ten kinds of primitive term.\n* ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|The Topics]]'' (with an appendix called ''[[On Sophistical Refutations]]''), a discussion of dialectics.\n* ''[[De Interpretatione|On Interpretation]]'', an analysis of simple [[categorical proposition]]s into simple terms, negation, and signs of quantity. \n* ''[[Prior Analytics|The Prior Analytics]]'', a formal analysis of what makes a [[syllogism]] (a valid argument, according to Aristotle).\n* ''[[Posterior Analytics|The Posterior Analytics]]'', a study of scientific demonstration, containing Aristotle's mature views on logic.\n[[File:Square of opposition, set diagrams.svg|thumb|180px|This diagram shows the contradictory relationships between [[categorical proposition]]s in the [[square of opposition]] of [[Term logic|Aristotelian logic]].]]\nThese works are of outstanding importance in the history of logic. In the ''Categories'', he attempts to discern all the possible things to which a term can refer; this idea underpins his philosophical work ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', which itself had a profound influence on Western thought.\n\nHe also developed a theory of non-formal logic (''i.e.,'' the theory of [[logical fallacy|fallacies]]), which is presented in ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations''.<ref name=\"Bochenski p. 63\"/>\n\n''On Interpretation'' contains a comprehensive treatment of the notions of [[Square of opposition|opposition]] and conversion; chapter 7 is at the origin of the [[square of opposition]] (or logical square); chapter 9 contains the beginning of [[modal logic]].\n\nThe ''Prior Analytics'' contains his exposition of the \"syllogism\", where three important principles are applied for the first time in history: the use of variables, a purely formal treatment, and the use of an axiomatic system.\n\n===Stoics===\n{{Main|Stoic logic}}\nThe other great school of Greek logic is that of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].<ref>\"Throughout later antiquity two great schools of logic were distinguished, the Peripatetic which was derived from Aristotle, and the Stoic which was developed by Chrysippus from the teachings of the Megarians\" \u2013 Kneale p. 113</ref> Stoic logic traces its roots back to the late 5th century BC philosopher [[Euclid of Megara]], a pupil of [[Socrates]] and slightly older contemporary of Plato, probably following in the tradition of Parmenides and Zeno. His pupils and successors were called \"[[Megarian school|Megarians]]\", or \"Eristics\", and later the \"Dialecticians\". The two most important dialecticians of the Megarian school were [[Diodorus Cronus]] and [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo]], who were active in the late 4th century BC. \n[[File:Chrysippos BM 1846.jpg|alt=Stone bust of a bearded, grave-looking man|thumb|160px|[[Chrysippus]] of Soli]]\nThe Stoics adopted the Megarian logic and systemized it. The most important member of the school was [[Chrysippus]] (c. 278\u2013c. 206 BC), who was its third head, and who formalized much of Stoic doctrine.  He is supposed to have written over 700 works, including at least 300 on logic, almost none of which survive.<ref>''Oxford Companion'', article \"Chrysippus\", p. 134</ref><ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: [[Susanne Bobzien]], ''Ancient Logic''</ref> Unlike with Aristotle, we have no complete works by the Megarians or the early Stoics, and have to rely mostly on accounts (sometimes hostile) by later sources, including prominently [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], [[Sextus Empiricus]], [[Galen]], [[Aulus Gellius]], [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], and [[Cicero]].<ref>K. Huelser, Die Fragmente zur Dialektik der Stoiker, 4 vols, Stuttgart 1986-7</ref>\n\nThree significant contributions of the Stoic school were (i) their account of [[Modal logic|modality]], (ii) their theory of the [[Material conditional]], and (iii) their account of [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] and [[truth]].<ref>Kneale 117\u2013158</ref>\n\n* ''Modality''. According to Aristotle, the Megarians of his day claimed there was no distinction between [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|potentiality and actuality]].<ref>''Metaphysics'' Eta 3, 1046b 29</ref>  Diodorus Cronus defined the possible as that which either is or will be, the impossible as what will not be true, and the contingent as that which either is already, or will be false.<ref>[[Boethius]], ''Commentary on the Perihermenias'', Meiser p. 234</ref> Diodorus is also famous for what is known as his [[Master argument (Diodorus Cronus)|Master argument]], which states that each pair of the following 3 propositions contradicts the third proposition:\n:* Everything that is past is true and necessary.\n:* The impossible does not follow from the possible.\n:* What neither is nor will be is possible.\n: Diodorus used the plausibility of the first two to prove that nothing is possible if it neither is nor will be true.<ref>[[Epictetus]], ''Dissertationes'' ed. Schenkel ii. 19. I.</ref>  Chrysippus, by contrast, denied the second premise and said that the impossible could follow from the possible.<ref>Alexander p. 177</ref>\n\n* ''Conditional statements''. The first logicians to debate [[Material conditional|conditional statements]] were Diodorus and his pupil Philo of Megara. Sextus Empiricus refers three times to a debate between Diodorus and Philo. Philo regarded a conditional as true unless it has both a true [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and a false [[consequent]]. Precisely, let ''T<sub>0</sub>'' and ''T<sub>1</sub>'' be true statements, and let ''F<sub>0</sub>'' and ''F<sub>1</sub>'' be false statements; then, according to Philo, each of the following conditionals is a true statement, because it is not the case that the consequent is false while the antecedent is true (it is not the case that a false statement is asserted to follow from a true statement):\n:* If ''T<sub>0</sub>'', then ''T<sub>1</sub>''\n:* If ''F<sub>0</sub>'', then ''T<sub>0</sub>''\n:* If ''F<sub>0</sub>'', then ''F<sub>1</sub>''\n: The following conditional does not meet this requirement, and is therefore a false statement according to Philo:\n:* If ''T<sub>0</sub>, then ''F<sub>0</sub>''\n: Indeed, Sextus says \"According to &#91;Philo&#93;, there are three ways in which a conditional may be true, and one in which it may be false.\"<ref name=sextus-adv-math>Sextus Empiricus, ''Adv. Math.'' viii, Section 113</ref> Philo's criterion of truth is what would now be called a [[truth-functional]] definition of \"if ... then\"; it is the definition used in [[predicate logic|modern logic]].\n\n:In contrast, Diodorus allowed the validity of conditionals only when the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion.<ref name=sextus-adv-math /><ref>Sextus Empiricus, ''Hypotyp.'' ii. 110, comp.</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 47, ''de Fato'', 6.</ref> A century later, the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Chrysippus]] attacked the assumptions of both Philo and Diodorus.\n* ''Meaning and truth''. The most important and striking difference between Megarian-Stoic logic and Aristotelian logic is that Megarian-Stoic logic concerns propositions, not terms, and is thus closer to modern [[propositional logic]].<ref>See e.g. Lukasiewicz p. 21</ref> The Stoics distinguished between utterance (''phone''), which may be noise, speech (''lexis''), which is articulate but which may be meaningless, and discourse (''logos''), which is meaningful utterance. The most original part of their theory is the idea that what is expressed by a sentence, called a ''lekton'', is something real; this corresponds to what is now called a ''proposition''. Sextus says that according to the Stoics, three things are linked together: that which signifies, that which is signified, and the object; for example, that which signifies is the word ''Dion'', and that which is signified is what Greeks understand but barbarians do not, and the object is Dion himself.<ref>Sextus Bk viii., Sections 11, 12</ref>\n\n==Medieval logic==\n\n===Logic in the Middle East===\n{{Main|Logic in Islamic philosophy}}\n{{See also|Avicennism#Avicennian logic|l1=Avicennian logic}}\n[[File:Canon-Avicenna-small.jpg|alt=Arabic text in pink and blue|thumb|A text by [[Avicenna]], founder of [[Avicennism#Avicennian logic|Avicennian logic]] ]]\n\nThe works of [[Al-Kindi]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Ghazali]], [[Averroes]] and other Muslim logicians were based on Aristotelian logic and were important in communicating the ideas of the ancient world to the medieval West.<ref>See e.g. [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/H057 Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy Online Version 2.0]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YFDTux7u?url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/islamic-philosophy;jsessionid=B31B033F077DD5E68E09CC9D35C02105 |date=2015-05-03 }}, article 'Islamic philosophy'</ref> [[Al-Farabi]] (Alfarabi) (873\u2013950) was an Aristotelian logician who discussed the topics of [[future contingent]]s, the number and relation of the categories, the relation between [[logic]] and [[grammar]], and non-Aristotelian forms of [[inference]].<ref name=Britannica/> Al-Farabi also considered the theories of [[conditional syllogism]]s and [[Analogy|analogical inference]], which were part of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] tradition of logic rather than the Aristotelian.<ref>{{Cite journal | issn = 0022-362X | volume = 61 | issue = 22 | pages = 724\u2013734 | last = Feldman | first = Seymour | title = Rescher on Arabic Logic | journal = The Journal of Philosophy| date = 1964-11-26 | jstor = 2023632 | doi = 10.2307/2023632 | publisher = Journal of Philosophy, Inc.}} [726]. {{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-27556-3 | last = Long | first = A.

This was further elaborated by his student Afdaladd\u00een al-Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee (d. 1249), who developed a form of logic revolving around the subject matter of [[concept]]ions and [[Grammar of Assent|assents]]. In response to this tradition, [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] (1201\u20131274) began a tradition of Neo-Avicennian logic which remained faithful to Avicenna's work and existed as an alternative to the more dominant Post-Avicennian school over the following centuries.<ref name=Stanford/>\n\nThe [[Illuminationist philosophy|Illuminationist school]] was founded by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] (1155\u20131191), who developed the idea of \"decisive necessity\", which refers to the reduction of all modalities (necessity, [[Logical possibility|possibility]], [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] and [[impossibility]]) to the single mode of necessity.<ref>Dr. Lotfollah Nabavi, [http://public.ut.ac.ir/html/fac/lit/articles.html Sohrevardi's Theory of Decisive Necessity and kripke's QSS System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126100838/http://public.ut.ac.ir/html/fac/lit/articles.html |date=2008-01-26 }}, ''Journal of Faculty of Literature and Human Sciences''.</ref> [[Ibn al-Nafis]] (1213\u20131288) wrote a book on Avicennian logic, which was a commentary of Avicenna's ''Al-Isharat'' (''The Signs'') and  ''Al-Hidayah'' (''The Guidance'').<ref name=Roubi>Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), \"Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher\", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=2008-02-06 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'').</ref> [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (1263\u20131328), wrote the ''Ar-Radd 'ala al-Mantiqiyyin'', where he argued against the usefulness, though not the validity, of the [[syllogism]]<ref>See pp.&nbsp;253\u2013254 of {{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-52069-0 | pages = 247\u2013265 | editors = Peter Adamson and Richard C.

When the study of logic resumed after the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], the main source was the work of the Christian philosopher [[Boethius]], who was familiar with some of Aristotle's logic, but almost none of the work of the Stoics.<ref name=Kneale198>Kneale p. 198</ref>  Until the twelfth century, the only works of Aristotle available in the West were the ''Categories'', ''On Interpretation'', and Boethius's translation of the [[Isagoge]] of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (a commentary on the Categories). These works were known as the \"Old Logic\" (''Logica Vetus'' or ''Ars Vetus''). An important work in this tradition was the ''Logica Ingredientibus'' of [[Peter Abelard]] (1079\u20131142).  His direct influence was small,<ref>Stephen Dumont, article \"Peter Abelard\" in Gracia and Noone p. 492</ref> but his influence through pupils such as [[John of Salisbury]] was great, and his method of applying rigorous logical analysis to theology shaped the way that theological criticism developed in the period that followed.<ref>Kneale, pp. 202\u20133</ref>\n\nBy the early thirteenth century, the remaining works of Aristotle's ''Organon'' (including the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', and the ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'') had been recovered in the West.<ref>See e.g. Kneale p. 225</ref>  Logical work until then was mostly paraphrasis or commentary on the work of Aristotle.<ref>Boehner p. 1</ref> The period from the middle of the thirteenth to the middle of the fourteenth century was one of significant developments in logic, particularly in three areas which were original, with little foundation in the Aristotelian tradition that came before.  These were:<ref>Boehner pp. 19\u201376</ref>\n\n* The theory of [[Supposition theory|supposition]]. Supposition theory deals with the way that predicates (''e.g.,'' 'man') range over a domain of individuals (''e.g.,'' all men).<ref>Boehner p. 29</ref>  In the proposition 'every man is an animal', does the term 'man' range over or 'supposit for' men existing just in the present, or does the range include past and future men? Can a term supposit for a non-existing individual?  Some medievalists have argued that this idea is a precursor of modern [[first-order logic]].<ref>Boehner p. 30</ref> \"The theory of supposition with the associated theories of ''copulatio'' (sign-capacity of adjectival terms), ''ampliatio'' (widening of referential domain), and ''distributio'' constitute one of the most original achievements of Western medieval logic\".<ref>Ebbesen 1981</ref>\n* The theory of [[Syncategorematic term|syncategoremata]].  Syncategoremata are terms which are necessary for logic, but which, unlike ''categorematic'' terms, do not signify on their own behalf, but 'co-signify' with other words.  Examples of syncategoremata are 'and', 'not', 'every', 'if', and so on.\n* The theory of [[Logical consequence|consequences]].  A consequence is a hypothetical, conditional proposition: two propositions joined by the terms 'if ... then'.  For example, 'if a man runs, then God exists' (''Si homo currit, Deus est'').<ref>Boehner pp. 54\u20135</ref>  A fully developed theory of consequences is given in Book III of [[William of Ockham]]'s work [[Summa Logicae]].  There, Ockham distinguishes between 'material' and 'formal' consequences, which are roughly equivalent to the modern [[Material conditional|material implication]] and [[logical implication]] respectively.  Similar accounts are given by [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Albert of Saxony]].\n\nThe last great works in this tradition are the ''Logic'' of John Poinsot (1589\u20131644, known as [[John of St Thomas]]), the ''Metaphysical Disputations'' of [[Francisco Suarez]] (1548\u20131617), and the ''Logica Demonstrativa'' of [[Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri]] (1667\u20131733).\n\n==Traditional logic==\n\n===The textbook tradition===\n[[File:Fennerartoflogic-small.jpg|alt=Frontispiece, with title beginning \"The Artes of Logike and Rethorike, plainlie set foorth in the English tounge, easie to be learned and practised\".|thumb|[[Dudley Fenner]]'s ''Art of Logic'' (1584)]]\n''Traditional logic'' generally means the textbook tradition that begins with [[Antoine Arnauld]]'s and [[Pierre Nicole]]'s ''Logic, or the Art of Thinking'', better known as the ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]''.<ref>''Oxford Companion'' p. 504, article \"Traditional logic\"</ref> Published in 1662, it was the most influential work on logic after Aristotle until the nineteenth century.<ref name=\"Buroker xxiii\">Buroker xxiii</ref> The book presents a loosely Cartesian doctrine (that the proposition is a combining of ideas rather than terms, for example) within a framework that is broadly derived from Aristotelian and medieval [[term logic]]. Between 1664 and 1700, there were eight editions, and the book had considerable influence after that.<ref name=\"Buroker xxiii\"/>  The Port-Royal introduces the concepts of [[extension (semantics)|extension]] and [[intension]]. The account of [[proposition]]s that [[John Locke|Locke]] gives in the ''Essay'' is essentially that of the Port-Royal:  \"Verbal propositions, which are words, [are] the signs of our ideas, put together or separated in affirmative or negative sentences. So that proposition consists in the putting together or separating these signs, according as the things which they stand for agree or disagree.\"<ref>(Locke, ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', IV. 5. 6)</ref>\n\n[[Dudley Fenner]] helped popularize [[Ramist]] logic, a reaction against Aristotle. Another influential work was the ''[[Novum Organum]]'' by [[Francis Bacon]], published in 1620. The title translates as \"new instrument\". This is a reference to [[Aristotle]]'s work known as the ''[[Organon]]''. In this work, Bacon rejects the syllogistic method of Aristotle in favor of an alternative procedure \"which by slow and faithful toil gathers information from things and brings it into understanding\".<ref>Farrington, 1964, 89</ref> This method is known as [[inductive reasoning]], a method which starts from empirical observation and proceeds to lower axioms or propositions; from these lower axioms, more general ones can be induced. For example, in finding the cause of a ''phenomenal nature'' such as heat, 3 lists should be constructed:\n* The presence list: a list of every situation where heat is found.\n* The absence list: a list of every situation that is similar to at least one of those of the presence list, except for the lack of heat.\n* The variability list: a list of every situation where heat can vary.\nThen, the ''form nature'' (or cause) of heat may be defined as that which is common to every situation of the presence list, and which is lacking from every situation of the absence list, and which varies by degree in every situation of the variability list.\n\nOther works in the textbook tradition include [[Isaac Watts]]'s ''Logick: Or, the Right Use of Reason'' (1725), [[Richard Whately]]'s ''Logic'' (1826), and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''A System of Logic'' (1843).  Although the latter was one of the last great works in the tradition, Mill's view that the foundations of logic lie in introspection<ref>N. Abbagnano, \"Psychologism\" in P. Edwards (ed) ''The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', MacMillan, 1967</ref>  influenced the view that logic is best understood as a branch of psychology, a view which dominated the next fifty years of its development, especially in Germany.<ref>Of the German literature in this period, Robert Adamson wrote \"''Logics'' swarm as bees in springtime...\"; Robert Adamson, ''A Short History of Logic'', Wm. Blackwood & Sons, 1911, page 242</ref>\n\n===Logic in Hegel's philosophy===\n[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]\n[[G.W.F. Hegel]] indicated the importance of logic to his philosophical system when he condensed his extensive ''[[Science of Logic]]'' into a shorter work published in 1817 as the first volume of his ''Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences.''  The \"Shorter\" or \"Encyclopaedia\" ''Logic'', as it is often known, lays out a series of transitions which leads from the most empty and abstract of categories\u2014Hegel begins with \"Pure Being\" and \"Pure Nothing\"\u2014to the \"[[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]\", the category which contains and resolves all the categories which preceded it.  Despite the title, Hegel's ''Logic'' is not really a contribution to the science of valid inference.  Rather than deriving conclusions about concepts through valid inference from premises, Hegel seeks to show that thinking about one concept compels thinking about another concept (one cannot, he argues, possess the concept of \"Quality\" without the concept of \"Quantity\"); this compulsion is, supposedly, not a matter of individual psychology, because it arises almost organically from the content of the concepts themselves.  His purpose is to show the rational structure of the \"Absolute\"\u2014indeed of rationality itself.  The method by which thought is driven from one concept to its contrary, and then to further concepts, is known as the Hegelian [[dialectic]].\n\nAlthough Hegel's ''Logic'' has had little impact on mainstream logical studies, its influence can be seen elsewhere:\n* [[Karl von Prantl|Carl von Prantl]]'s ''Geschichte der Logik in Abendland'' (1855\u20131867).<ref>Carl von Prantl (1855-1867), ''Geschichte von Logik in Abendland'', Leipsig:  S. Hirzl, anastatically reprinted in 1997, Hildesheim:  Georg Olds.</ref>\n* The work of the [[British Idealism|British Idealists]], such as F.H. Bradley's ''Principles of Logic'' (1883).\n* The economic, political, and philosophical studies of [[Karl Marx]], and in the various schools of [[Marxism]].\n\n===Logic and psychology===\nBetween the work of Mill and Frege stretched half a century during which logic was widely treated as a descriptive science, an empirical study of the structure of reasoning, and thus essentially as a branch of [[psychology]].<ref>See e.g. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism Psychologism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref>  The German psychologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]], for example, discussed deriving \"the logical from the psychological laws of thought\", emphasizing that \"psychological thinking is always the more comprehensive form of thinking.\"<ref>Wilhelm Wundt, ''Logik'' (1880\u20131883); quoted in Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, pp. 115\u2013116.</ref>  This view was widespread among German philosophers of the period:\n* [[Theodor Lipps]] described logic as \"a specific discipline of psychology\".<ref>Theodor Lipps, ''Grundz\u00fcge der Logik'' (1893); quoted in Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. 40</ref>\n* [[Christoph von Sigwart]] understood logical necessity as grounded in the individual's compulsion to think in a certain way.<ref>Christoph von Sigwart, ''Logik'' (1873\u201378); quoted in Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. 51</ref>\n* [[Benno Erdmann]] argued that \"logical laws only hold within the limits of our thinking\".<ref>Benno Erdmann, ''Logik'' (1892); quoted in Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. 96</ref>\nSuch was the dominant view of logic in the years following Mill's work.<ref>Dermot Moran, \"Introduction\"; Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. xxi</ref>  This psychological approach to logic was rejected by [[Gottlob Frege]].  It was also subjected to an extended and destructive critique by [[Edmund Husserl]] in the first volume of his ''Logical Investigations'' (1900), an assault which has been described as \"overwhelming\".<ref>Michael Dummett, \"Preface\"; Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. xvii</ref>  Husserl argued forcefully that grounding logic in psychological observations implied that all logical truths remained unproven, and that [[skepticism]] and [[relativism]] were unavoidable consequences.\n\nSuch criticisms did not immediately extirpate what is called \"[[psychologism]]\". For example, the American philosopher [[Josiah Royce]], while acknowledging the force of Husserl's critique, remained \"unable to doubt\" that progress in psychology would be accompanied by progress in logic, and vice versa.<ref>Josiah Royce, \"Recent Logical Enquiries and their Psychological Bearings\" (1902) in John J. McDermott (ed) ''The Basic Writings of Josiah Royce'' Volume 2, Fordham University Press, 2005, p. 661</ref>\n\n==Rise of modern logic==\nThe period between the fourteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century had been largely one of decline and neglect, and is generally regarded as barren by historians of logic.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  The revival of logic occurred in the mid-nineteenth century, at the beginning of a revolutionary period where the subject developed into a rigorous and formalistic discipline whose exemplar was the exact method of proof used in [[mathematics]]. The development of the modern \"symbolic\" or \"mathematical\" logic during this period is the most significant in the 2000-year history of logic, and is arguably one of the most important and remarkable events in human intellectual history.<ref name=\"Oxford Companion p. 500\"/>\n\nA number of features distinguish modern logic from the old Aristotelian or traditional logic, the most important of which are as follows:<ref>Bochenski, p. 266</ref>  Modern logic is fundamentally a ''calculus''  whose rules of operation are determined only by the ''shape'' and not by the ''meaning'' of the symbols it employs, as in mathematics.  Many logicians were impressed by the \"success\" of mathematics, in that there had been no prolonged dispute about any truly mathematical result. [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]] noted<ref>Peirce 1896</ref> that even though a mistake in the evaluation of a definite integral by [[Laplace]] led to an error concerning the moon's orbit that persisted for nearly 50 years, the mistake, once spotted, was corrected without any serious dispute.  Peirce contrasted this with the disputation and uncertainty surrounding traditional logic, and especially reasoning in [[metaphysics]]. He argued that a truly \"exact\" logic would depend upon mathematical, i.e., \"diagrammatic\" or \"iconic\" thought.  \"Those who follow such methods will ... escape all error except such as will be speedily corrected after it is once suspected\".  Modern logic is also \"constructive\" rather than \"abstractive\"; i.e., rather than abstracting and formalising theorems derived from ordinary language (or from psychological intuitions about validity), it constructs theorems by formal methods, then looks for an interpretation in ordinary language. It is entirely symbolic, meaning that even the logical constants (which the medieval logicians called \"[[Syncategorematic term|syncategoremata]]\") and the categoric terms are expressed in symbols.\n\n==Modern logic==\nThe development of modern logic falls into roughly five periods:<ref>See Bochenski p. 269</ref>\n* The '''embryonic period''' from [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] to 1847, when the notion of a logical calculus was discussed and developed, particularly by Leibniz, but no schools were formed, and isolated periodic attempts were abandoned or went unnoticed.\n* The '''algebraic period''' from [[Boole]]'s Analysis to [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der|Schr\u00f6der]]'s ''Vorlesungen''.  In this period, there were more practitioners, and a greater continuity of development.\n* The '''[[logicist]] period''' from the [[Begriffsschrift]] of [[Frege]] to the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' of [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[A.N. Whitehead|Whitehead]]. The aim of the \"logicist school\" was to incorporate the logic of all mathematical and scientific discourse in a single unified system which, taking as a fundamental principle that all mathematical truths are logical, did not accept any non-logical terminology.  The major logicists were [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], and the early [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]].<ref>''Oxford Companion'' p. 499</ref> It culminates with the ''Principia'', an important work which includes a thorough examination and attempted solution of the [[antinomy|antinomies]] which had been an obstacle to earlier progress.\n* The '''metamathematical period''' from 1910 to the 1930s, which saw the development of [[metalogic]], in the [[finitist]] system of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], and the non-finitist system of [[Leopold L\u00f6wenheim|L\u00f6wenheim]] and [[Skolem]], the combination of logic and metalogic in the work of [[G\u00f6del]] and [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]].  G\u00f6del's [[incompleteness theorem]] of 1931 was one of the greatest achievements in the history of logic.  Later in the 1930s, G\u00f6del developed the notion of [[set-theoretic constructibility]].\n* The '''period after World War II''', when [[mathematical logic]] branched into four inter-related but separate areas of research: [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], [[computability theory]], and [[set theory]], and its ideas and methods began to influence [[philosophy]].\n\n===Embryonic period===\n[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|upright|Leibniz]]\nThe idea that inference could be represented by a purely mechanical process is found as early as [[Ramon Llull|Raymond Llull]], who proposed a (somewhat eccentric) method of drawing conclusions by a system of concentric rings.  The work of logicians such as the [[Oxford Calculators]]<ref>Edith Sylla (1999), \"Oxford Calculators\", in ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', Cambridge, Cambridgeshire:  Cambridge.</ref> led to a method of using letters instead of writing out logical calculations (''calculationes'') in words, a method used, for instance, in the ''Logica magna'' by [[Paul of Venice]].  Three hundred years after Llull, the English philosopher and logician [[Thomas Hobbes]] suggested that all logic and reasoning could be reduced to the mathematical operations of addition and subtraction.<ref>El. philos. sect. I de corp 1.1.2.</ref> The same idea is found in the work of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], who had read both Llull and Hobbes, and who argued that logic can be represented through a combinatorial process or calculus.  But, like Llull and Hobbes, he failed to develop a detailed or comprehensive system, and his work on this topic was not published until long after his death. Leibniz says that ordinary languages are subject to \"countless ambiguities\" and are unsuited for a calculus, whose task is to expose mistakes in inference arising from the forms and structures of words;<ref>Bochenski p. 274</ref> hence, he proposed to identify an [[alphabet of human thought]] comprising fundamental concepts which could be composed to express complex ideas,<ref>Rutherford, Donald, 1995, \"Philosophy and language\" in Jolley, N., ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz''. Cambridge Univ. Press.</ref> and create a ''[[calculus ratiocinator]]'' that would make all arguments \"as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate.\"<ref>Wiener, Philip, 1951. ''Leibniz: Selections''.

The school begins with Boole's seminal work ''Mathematical Analysis of Logic'' which appeared in 1847, although [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] (1847) is its immediate precursor.<ref>Before publishing, he wrote to [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]], who was just finishing his work ''Formal Logic''.  De Morgan suggested they should publish first, and thus the two books appeared at the same time, possibly even reaching the bookshops on the same day. cf. Kneale p. 404</ref> The fundamental idea of Boole's system is that algebraic formulae can be used to express logical relations.  This idea occurred to Boole in his teenage years, working as an usher in a private school in [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire]].<ref>Kneale p. 404</ref>  For example, let x and y stand for classes let the symbol ''='' signify that the classes have the same members, xy stand for the class containing all and only the members of x and y and so on.  Boole calls these ''elective symbols'', i.e. symbols which select certain objects for consideration.<ref name=\"Kneale p. 407\">Kneale p. 407</ref>  An expression in which elective symbols are used is called an ''elective function'', and an equation of which the members are elective functions, is an ''elective equation''.<ref>Boole (1847) p. 16</ref> The theory of elective functions and their \"development\" is essentially the modern idea of [[truth-function]]s and their expression in [[disjunctive normal form]].<ref name=\"Kneale p. 407\"/>\n\nBoole's system admits of two interpretations, in class logic, and propositional logic.  Boole distinguished between \"primary propositions\" which are the subject of syllogistic theory, and \"secondary propositions\", which are the subject of propositional logic, and showed how under different \"interpretations\" the same algebraic system could represent both. An example of a primary proposition is \"All inhabitants are either Europeans or Asiatics.\"  An example of a secondary proposition is \"Either all inhabitants are Europeans or they are all Asiatics.\"<ref>Boole 1847 pp. 58\u20139</ref>  These are easily distinguished in modern propositional calculus, where it is also possible to show that the first follows from the second, but it is a significant disadvantage that there is no way of representing this in the Boolean system.<ref>Beaney p. 11</ref>\n\nIn his ''Symbolic Logic'' (1881), [[John Venn]] used diagrams of overlapping areas to express Boolean relations between classes or truth-conditions of propositions. In 1869 Jevons realised that Boole's methods could be mechanised, and constructed a \"logical machine\" which he showed to the [[Royal Society]] the following year.<ref name=\"Kneale p. 407\"/>  In 1885 [[Allan Marquand]] proposed an electrical version of the machine that is still extant ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080908073359/http://finelib.princeton.edu/instruction/wri172_demonstration.php picture at the Firestone Library]).\n[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce.jpg|left|thumb|160px|Charles Sanders Peirce]]\nThe defects in Boole's system (such as the use of the letter ''v'' for existential propositions) were all remedied by his followers.  Jevons published ''Pure Logic, or the Logic of Quality apart from Quantity'' in 1864, where he suggested a symbol to signify [[exclusive or]], which allowed Boole's system to be greatly simplified.<ref>Kneale p. 422</ref>  This was usefully exploited by Schr\u00f6der when he set out theorems in parallel columns in his ''Vorlesungen'' (1890\u20131905).  Peirce (1880) showed how all the Boolean elective functions could be expressed by the use of a single primitive binary operation, \"[[Logical NOR|neither ... nor ...]]\" and equally well \"[[Sheffer stroke|not both ... and ...]]\",<ref>Peirce, \"A Boolean Algebra with One Constant\", 1880 MS, ''Collected Papers'' v. 4, paragraphs 12\u201320, reprinted ''Writings'' v. 4, pp. 218-21. Google [https://archive.org/details/writingsofcharle0002peir <!-- quote=378 Winter. --> Preview].</ref> however, like many of Peirce's innovations, this remained unknown or unnoticed until [[Henry M. Sheffer|Sheffer]] rediscovered it in 1913.<ref>''Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., xiv (1913)'', pp. 481\u20138. This is now known as the [[Sheffer stroke]]</ref>  Boole's early work also lacks the idea of the [[logical sum]] which originates in Peirce (1867), [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der|Schr\u00f6der]] (1877) and Jevons (1890),<ref>Bochenski 296</ref> and the concept of [[Inclusion (logic)|inclusion]], first suggested by Gergonne (1816) and clearly articulated by Peirce (1870).\n[[File:Boolean multiples of 2 3 5.svg|alt=Coloured diagram of 4 interlocking sets|right|thumb|250px|Boolean multiples]]\nThe success of Boole's algebraic system suggested that all logic must be capable of algebraic representation, and there were attempts to express a logic of relations in such form, of which the most ambitious was Schr\u00f6der's monumental ''Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik'' (\"Lectures on the Algebra of Logic\", vol iii 1895), although the original idea was again anticipated by Peirce.<ref>See CP III</ref>\n\nBoole's unwavering acceptance of Aristotle's logic is emphasized by the historian of logic [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]] in an accessible introduction to ''Laws of Thought''<ref>[[George Boole]]. 1854/2003. The Laws of Thought, facsimile of 1854 edition, with an introduction by J. Corcoran. Buffalo: Prometheus Books (2003). Reviewed by James van Evra in Philosophy in Review.24 (2004) 167\u2013169.</ref> Corcoran also wrote a point-by-point comparison of ''Prior Analytics'' and ''Laws of Thought''.<ref>JOHN CORCORAN, Aristotle's Prior Analytics and Boole's Laws of Thought, History and Philosophy of Logic, vol. 24 (2003), pp. 261\u2013288.</ref> According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle's logic. Boole's goals were \"to go under, over, and beyond\" Aristotle's logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations, 2) extending the class of problems it could treat \u2014 from assessing validity to solving equations \u2014 and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle \u2014 e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.\n\nMore specifically, Boole agreed with what [[Aristotle]] said; Boole's 'disagreements', if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. \nFirst, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced the four propositional forms of Aristotelian logic to formulas in the form of equations \u2014 by itself a revolutionary idea. \nSecond, in the realm of logic's problems, Boole's addition of equation solving to logic \u2014 another revolutionary idea \u2014 involved Boole's doctrine that Aristotle's rules of inference (the \"perfect syllogisms\") must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. \nThird, in the realm of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce \"No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus\" from \"No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle\" or from \"No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle\".\n\n===Logicist period===\n[[File:Young frege.jpg|thumb|160px|Gottlob Frege.]]\nAfter Boole, the next great advances were made by the German mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]]. Frege's objective was the program of [[Logicism]], i.e. demonstrating that arithmetic is identical with logic.<ref name=k435>Kneale p. 435</ref>  Frege went much further than any of his predecessors in his rigorous and formal approach to logic, and his calculus or [[Begriffsschrift]] is important.<ref name=k435/> Frege also tried to show that the concept of [[number]] can be defined by purely logical means, so that (if he was right) logic includes arithmetic and all branches of mathematics that are reducible to arithmetic.  He was not the first writer to suggest this.  In his pioneering work ''Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik'' (The Foundations of Arithmetic), sections 15\u201317, he acknowledges the efforts of Leibniz, [[J.S. Mill]] as well as Jevons, citing the latter's claim that \"algebra is a highly developed logic, and number but logical discrimination.\"<ref>Jevons, ''The Principles of Science'', London 1879, p. 156, quoted in ''Grundlagen'' 15</ref>\n\nFrege's first work, the ''Begriffsschrift'' (\"concept script\") is a rigorously axiomatised system of propositional logic, relying on just two connectives (negational and conditional), two rules of inference (''modus ponens'' and substitution), and six axioms.  Frege referred to the \"completeness\" of this system, but was unable to prove this.<ref>Beaney p. 10 \u2013 the completeness of Frege's system was eventually proved by [[Jan \u0141ukasiewicz]] in 1934</ref>  The most significant innovation, however, was his explanation of the [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] in terms of mathematical functions.  Traditional logic regards the sentence \"Caesar is a man\" as of fundamentally the same form as \"all men are mortal.\"  Sentences with a proper name subject were regarded as universal in character, interpretable as \"every Caesar is a man\".<ref>See for example the argument by the medieval logician [[William of Ockham]] that singular propositions are universal, in [[Summa Logicae]] III. 8 (??)</ref>  At the outset Frege abandons the traditional \"concepts ''subject'' and ''predicate''\", replacing them with ''argument'' and ''function'' respectively, which he believes \"will stand the test of time. It is easy to see how regarding a content as a function of an argument leads to the formation of concepts. Furthermore, the demonstration of the connection between the meanings of the words ''if, and, not, or, there is, some, all,'' and so forth, deserves attention\".<ref>{{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=7}}</ref> Frege argued that the quantifier expression \"all men\" does not have the same logical or semantic form as \"all men\", and that the universal proposition \"every A is B\" is a complex proposition involving two ''functions'', namely ' \u2013 is A' and ' \u2013 is B' such that whatever satisfies the first, also satisfies the second.  In modern notation, this would be expressed as\n\n: <math>\\forall \\; x \\big( A(x) \\rightarrow B (x) \\big)</math>\n\nIn English, \"for all x, if Ax then Bx\".  Thus only singular propositions are of subject-predicate form, and they are irreducibly singular, i.e. not reducible to a general proposition.  Universal and particular propositions, by contrast, are not of simple subject-predicate form at all.  If \"all mammals\" were the logical subject of the sentence \"all mammals are land-dwellers\", then to negate the whole sentence we would have to negate the predicate to give \"all mammals are ''not'' land-dwellers\".  But this is not the case.<ref>\"On concept and object\" p. 198; Geach p. 48</ref>  This functional analysis of ordinary-language sentences later had a great impact on philosophy and [[linguistics]].\n\nThis means that in Frege's calculus, Boole's \"primary\" propositions can be represented in a different way from \"secondary\" propositions.  \"All inhabitants are either men or women\" is\n[[File:BS-13-Begriffsschrift Quantifier2-svg.svg|130px|alt=Straight line with bend; text \"x\" over bend; text \"F(x)\" to the right of the line.|thumb|[[Frege]]'s \"Concept Script\"]]\n: <math>\\forall \\; x \\Big( I(x) \\rightarrow \\big( M(x) \\lor W(x) \\big) \\Big) </math>\n\nwhereas \"All the inhabitants are men or all the inhabitants are women\" is\n\n: <math>\\forall \\; x \\big( I(x) \\rightarrow M(x) \\big) \\lor \\forall \\;x \\big( I(x) \\rightarrow W(x) \\big)</math>\n\nAs Frege remarked in a critique of Boole's calculus:\n\n: \"The real difference is that I avoid [the Boolean] division into two parts ... and give a homogeneous presentation of the lot.  In Boole the two parts run alongside one another, so that one is like the mirror image of the other, but for that very reason stands in no organic relation to it'<ref>BLC p. 14, quoted in Beaney p. 12</ref>\n\nAs well as providing a unified and comprehensive system of logic, Frege's calculus also resolved the ancient [[problem of multiple generality]].  The ambiguity of \"every girl kissed a boy\" is difficult to express in traditional logic, but Frege's logic resolves this through the different scope of the quantifiers.  Thus\n\n:<math>\\forall \\; x \\Big( G(x) \\rightarrow  \\exists \\; y \\big( B(y) \\land K(x,y) \\big) \\Big)</math>\n[[File:Giuseppe_Peano.jpg|thumb|120px|Peano]]\nmeans that to every girl there corresponds some boy (any one will do) who the girl kissed. But\n\n:<math>\\exists \\;x \\Big( B(x) \\land \\forall \\;y \\big( G(y) \\rightarrow K(y, x) \\big) \\Big)</math>\n\nmeans that there is some particular boy whom every girl kissed. Without this device, the project of logicism would have been doubtful or impossible.  Using it, Frege provided a definition of the [[ancestral relation]], of the [[Injective function|many-to-one relation]], and of [[mathematical induction]].<ref>See e.g. [http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/f/frege.htm The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy], article \"Frege\"</ref>\n[[File:Ernst Zermelo 1900s.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Ernst Zermelo]]\nThis period overlaps with the work of what is known as the \"mathematical school\", which included [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]], [[Moritz Pasch|Pasch]], [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Ernst Zermelo|Zermelo]], [[Edward Vermilye Huntington|Huntington]], [[Oswald Veblen|Veblen]] and [[Arend Heyting|Heyting]]. Their objective was the axiomatisation of branches of mathematics like geometry, arithmetic, analysis and set theory. Most notable was [[Hilbert's Program]], which sought to ground all of mathematics to a finite set of axioms, proving its consistency by \"finitistic\" means and providing a procedure which would decide the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement. The standard [[axiomatization]] of the [[natural number]]s is named the [[Peano axioms]] eponymously. Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols. While unaware of Frege's work, he independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of Boole and Schr\u00f6der.<ref>Van Heijenoort 1967, p. 83</ref>\n\nThe logicist project received a near-fatal setback with the discovery of a paradox in 1901 by [[Bertrand Russell]].  This proved Frege's [[naive set theory]] led to a contradiction.  Frege's theory contained the axiom that for any formal criterion, there is a set of all objects that meet the criterion.  Russell showed that a set containing exactly the sets that are not members of themselves would contradict its own definition (if it is not a member of itself, it is a member of itself, and if it is a member of itself, it is not).<ref>See e.g. Potter 2004</ref> This contradiction is now known as [[Russell's paradox]]. One important method of resolving this paradox was proposed by [[Ernst Zermelo]].<ref>Zermelo 1908</ref> [[Zermelo set theory]] was the first [[axiomatic set theory]]. It was developed into the now-canonical [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF). Russell's paradox symbolically is as follows:\n\n:<math>\\text{Let } R = \\{ x \\mid x \\not \\in x \\} \\text{, then } R \\in R \\iff R \\not \\in R</math>\nThe monumental [[Principia Mathematica]], a three-volume work on the [[foundations of mathematics]], written by Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and published 1910\u201313 also included an attempt to resolve the paradox, by means of an elaborate [[system of types]]: a set of elements is of a different type than is each of its elements (set is not the element; one element is not the set) and one cannot speak of the \"[[set of all sets]]\".  The ''Principia'' was an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a well-defined set of [[axiom]]s and [[inference rule]]s in [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]].\n\n===Metamathematical period===\n[[File:Kurt g\u00f6del.jpg|thumb|130px|right|Kurt G\u00f6del]]\nThe names of [[Kurt G\u00f6del|G\u00f6del]] and [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] dominate the 1930s,<ref>Feferman 1999 p. 1</ref> a crucial period in the development of [[metamathematics]] \u2013 the study of mathematics using mathematical methods to produce [[metatheory|metatheories]], or mathematical theories about other mathematical theories.  Early investigations into metamathematics had been driven by Hilbert's program. Work on metamathematics culminated in the work of G\u00f6del, who in 1929 showed that a given [[first-order logic|first-order sentence]] is [[Provability logic|deducible]] if and only if it is logically valid \u2013 i.e. it is true in every [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] for its language.  This is known as [[G\u00f6del's completeness theorem]].  A year later, he proved two important theorems, which showed Hibert's program to be unattainable in its original form.  The first is that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an [[Effective method|effective procedure]] such as an [[algorithm]] or computer program is capable of proving all facts about the [[natural number]]s.  For any such system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second is that if such a system is also capable of proving certain basic facts about the natural numbers, then the system cannot prove the consistency of the system itself.  These two results are known as [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]], or simply ''G\u00f6del's Theorem''.  Later in the decade, G\u00f6del developed the concept of [[set-theoretic constructibility]], as part of his proof that the [[axiom of choice]] and the [[continuum hypothesis]] are consistent with [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]].\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Alonzo Church.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Alonzo Church]] -->\nIn [[proof theory]], [[Gerhard Gentzen]] developed [[natural deduction]] and the [[sequent calculus]].  The former attempts to model logical reasoning as it 'naturally' occurs in practice and is most easily applied to intuitionistic logic, while the latter was devised to clarify the derivation of logical proofs in any formal system.  Since Gentzen's work, natural deduction and sequent calculi have been widely applied in the fields of proof theory, mathematical logic and computer science.  Gentzen also proved normalization and cut-elimination theorems for intuitionistic and classical logic which could be used to reduce logical proofs to a normal form.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jean-Yves | last=Girard | authorlink=Jean-Yves Girard | author2=Paul Taylor | author3=Yves Lafont | title=Proofs and Types | publisher=Cambridge University Press (Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science, 7) | year=1990 | origyear=1989 | isbn=0-521-37181-3 | url=https://archive.org/details/proofstypes0000gira | url-access=registration }}</ref><ref>{{MathWorld | urlname=CutEliminationTheorem | title=Cut Elimination Theorem | author=Alex Sakharov}}</ref>\n[[File:AlfredTarski1968.jpeg|right|200px|alt=Balding man, with bookshelf in background|thumb|Alfred Tarski]]\n[[Alfred Tarski]], a pupil of [[Jan \u0141ukasiewicz|\u0141ukasiewicz]], is best known for his definition of truth and [[logical consequence]], and the semantic concept of [[Open sentence|logical satisfaction]].  In 1933, he published (in Polish) ''The concept of truth in formalized languages'', in which he proposed his [[semantic theory of truth]]: a sentence such as \"snow is white\" is true if and only if snow is white.  Tarski's theory separated the [[metalanguage]], which makes the statement about truth, from the [[object language]], which contains the sentence whose truth is being asserted, and gave a correspondence (the [[T-schema]]) between phrases in the object language and elements of an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]].  Tarski's approach to the difficult idea of explaining truth has been enduringly influential in logic and philosophy, especially in the development of [[model theory]].<ref>Feferman and Feferman 2004, p. 122, discussing \"The Impact of Tarski's Theory of Truth\".</ref>  Tarski also produced important work on the methodology of deductive systems, and on fundamental principles such as [[completeness (logic)|completeness]], [[decidability (logic)|decidability]], [[consistency]] and [[Structure (mathematical logic)|definability]]. According to Anita Feferman, Tarski \"changed the face of logic in the twentieth century\".<ref>Feferman 1999, p. 1</ref>\n\n[[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] proposed formal models of computability, giving independent negative solutions to Hilbert's ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' in 1936 and 1937, respectively. The ''Entscheidungsproblem'' asked for a procedure that, given any formal mathematical statement, would algorithmically determine whether the statement is true.  Church and Turing proved there is no such procedure; Turing's paper introduced the [[halting problem]] as a key example of a mathematical problem without an algorithmic solution.\n\nChurch's system for computation developed into the modern [[\u03bb-calculus]], while the [[Turing machine]] became a standard model for a general-purpose computing device. It was soon shown that many other proposed models of computation were equivalent in power to those proposed by Church and Turing. These results led to the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]] that any deterministic [[algorithm]] that can be carried out by a human can be carried out by a Turing machine. Church proved additional undecidability results, showing that both [[Peano arithmetic]] and [[first-order logic]] are [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]]. Later work by [[Emil Post]] and [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] in the 1940s extended the scope of computability theory and introduced the concept of [[degrees of unsolvability]].\n\nThe results of the first few decades of the twentieth century also had an impact upon [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophical logic]], particularly from the 1950s onwards, in subjects such as [[modal logic]], [[temporal logic]], [[deontic logic]], and [[relevance logic]].\n\n===Logic after WWII===\n[[File:Kripke.JPG|alt=Man with a beard and straw hat on a beach|thumb|[[Saul Kripke]]]]\n\nAfter World War II, [[mathematical logic]] branched into four inter-related but separate areas of research: [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], [[computability theory]], and [[set theory]].<ref>See e.g. Barwise, ''Handbook of Mathematical Logic''</ref>\n\nIn set theory, the method of [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] revolutionized the field by providing a robust method for constructing models and obtaining independence results. <!-- Kunen p. 235ff, Kanamori p. 114ff --> [[Paul Cohen]] introduced this method in 1963 to prove the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]] and the [[axiom of choice]] from [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/72252 The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis, II]  Paul J.

It developed into a study of abstract computability, which became known as [[recursion theory]].<ref>Many of the foundational papers are collected in ''The Undecidable'' (1965) edited by Martin Davis</ref>  The [[Turing degree|priority method]], discovered independently by [[Albert Muchnik]] and [[Richard Friedberg]] in the 1950s, led to major advances in the understanding of the [[degrees of unsolvability]] and related structures. <!-- cooper 246 -->  Research into higher-order computability theory demonstrated its connections to set theory. <!-- sacks \"higher recursion theory\" -->  The fields of [[constructive analysis]] and [[computable analysis]] were developed to study the effective content of classical mathematical theorems; these in turn inspired the program of [[reverse mathematics]].  A separate branch of computability theory, [[computational complexity theory]], was also characterized in logical terms as a result of investigations into [[descriptive complexity]].\n\nModel theory applies the methods of mathematical logic to study models of particular mathematical theories. Alfred Tarski published much pioneering work in the field, which is named after a series of papers he published under the title ''Contributions to the theory of models''. <!-- \"alfred tarski's work in model theory\", vaught, JSL, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2273900 --> In the 1960s, [[Abraham Robinson]] used model-theoretic techniques to develop calculus and analysis based on [[non-standard analysis|infinitesimals]], a problem that first had been proposed by Leibniz. <!-- Keisler, fundamentals of model theory, HML, p. 48 -->\n\nIn proof theory, the relationship between classical mathematics and intuitionistic mathematics was clarified via tools such as the [[realizability]] method invented by [[Georg Kreisel]] and G\u00f6del's [[Dialectica interpretation|''Dialectica'' interpretation]]. This work inspired the contemporary area of [[proof mining]]. The [[Curry\u2013Howard correspondence]] emerged as a deep analogy between logic and computation, including a correspondence between systems of natural deduction and [[typed lambda calculus|typed lambda calculi]] used in computer science.  As a result, research into this class of formal systems began to address both logical and computational aspects; this area of research came to be known as modern type theory.  Advances were also made in [[ordinal analysis]] and the study of independence results in arithmetic such as the [[Paris\u2013Harrington theorem]].\n\nThis was also a period, particularly in the 1950s and afterwards, when the ideas of mathematical logic begin to influence philosophical thinking.  For example, [[tense logic]] is a formalised system for representing, and reasoning about, propositions qualified in terms of time. The philosopher [[Arthur Prior]] played a significant role in its development in the 1960s. [[Modal logic]]s extend the scope of formal logic to include the elements of [[Linguistic modality|modality]] (for example, [[Logical possibility|possibility]] and [[Necessary and sufficient conditions#Necessary conditions|necessity]]).
