The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 93 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

At {{convert|33-37|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=4}} in length, it is the second largest species of Australian [[honeyeater]]. It has mainly  grey-brown plumage, with red eyes, distinctive pinkish-red [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]] on either side of the neck, white streaks on the chest and a large bright yellow patch on the lower belly. The sexes are similar in plumage. Juveniles have less prominent wattles and browner eyes. [[John White (surgeon)|John White]] described the red wattlebird in 1790. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe species is found in southeast [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and southwest [[Western Australia]] in open forest and woodlands, and is a common visitor to urban gardens and parks. Loud and conspicuous, the red wattlebird is generally found in trees, where it gets most of its food; occasionally it forages on the ground. It is one of the largest [[Nectarivore|nectarivorous]] birds in the world, feeding from a wide variety of flowering plants. Insects also comprise part of its diet. It is territorial and at times aggressive towards birds of other species, often defending rich sources of nectar. Breeding throughout its range, the red wattlebird builds a cup-shaped nest in a tree and raises one or two broods a year. Although it has declined in places from [[land clearing|land-clearing]], it is classified as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red wattlebird was first described as the wattled bee-eater by the Irish surgeon and naturalist, [[John White (surgeon)|John White]], in his ''Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales'', which was published in 1790.<ref name=IUCN/> He wrote that it was the \"size of a [[Mistle thrush|missel thrush]], but much larger in proportion\".{{sfn|White|1790|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/47182685 144]}} The taxonomic descriptions in White's book are believed to have been written by the English naturalist, [[George Shaw]],{{sfn|White|1790|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/47182825 240]}}<ref>{{ cite journal | last=Nelson | first=E.

At {{convert|33-37|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=4}} in length, it is the second largest species of Australian [[honeyeater]]. It has mainly  grey-brown plumage, with red eyes, distinctive pinkish-red [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]] on either side of the neck, white streaks on the chest and a large bright yellow patch on the lower belly. The sexes are similar in plumage. Juveniles have less prominent wattles and browner eyes. [[John White (surgeon)|John White]] described the red wattlebird in 1790. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe species is found in southeast [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and southwest [[Western Australia]] in open forest and woodlands, and is a common visitor to urban gardens and parks. Loud and conspicuous, the red wattlebird is generally found in trees, where it gets most of its food; occasionally it forages on the ground. It is one of the largest [[Nectarivore|nectarivorous]] birds in the world, feeding from a wide variety of flowering plants. Insects also comprise part of its diet. It is territorial and at times aggressive towards birds of other species, often defending rich sources of nectar. Breeding throughout its range, the red wattlebird builds a cup-shaped nest in a tree and raises one or two broods a year. Although it has declined in places from [[land clearing|land-clearing]], it is classified as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red wattlebird was first described as the wattled bee-eater by the Irish surgeon and naturalist, [[John White (surgeon)|John White]], in his ''Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales'', which was published in 1790.<ref name=IUCN/> He wrote that it was the \"size of a [[Mistle thrush|missel thrush]], but much larger in proportion\".{{sfn|White|1790|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/47182685 144]}} The taxonomic descriptions in White's book are believed to have been written by the English naturalist, [[George Shaw]],{{sfn|White|1790|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/47182825 240]}}<ref>{{ cite journal | last=Nelson | first=E.

Further south into New South Wales it is found most places east of (and including) the [[Great Dividing Range]] and stretching west to the southern North-West Plain, Central Western Slopes and eastern [[Riverina]], and is an occasional visitor to points along the Murray River valley. It is found across Victoria, though is uncommon in the northwest of the state. In South Australia, Devonborough Downs Station, Manunda, [[Wilpena Pound]] and Nullarbor Station mark the northern limits of its range. There are scattered records from the [[Nullarbor Plain]], but the species is common in [[Western Australia]] west of  125&nbsp;\u00b0E and south of 29&nbsp;\u00b0S.{{sfn|Higgins|2001|p=464}} The yellow wattlebird replaces it in Tasmania.<ref name=BiB>{{cite web| url=http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Anthochaera-carunculata | title=Red Wattlebird | work=Birds in Backyards |accessdate=25 December 2016 | publisher=Birdlife Australia}}</ref> The red wattlebird has become more common in some localities, such as the [[Sunraysia]] district in the 1960s, and [[Nambucca Heads, New South Wales|Nambucca Heads]] and [[Lefevre Peninsula]] in the 1980s.{{sfn|Higgins|2001|p=464}} Breeding numbers have increased in Sydney and Adelaide.{{sfn|Higgins|2001|p=465}} The red wattlebird is a rare [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] to New Zealand, with confirmed records at [[Matakana]] in 1865 and Rohutu, [[Taranaki]], in 1885, and a third unconfirmed report from [[Motupiko River|Motupiko]] in 1938.{{sfn|Higgins|2001|p=464}}\n\nThe red wattlebird appears to be a permanent resident in much of its range, though its movements are poorly known.

It is the principal route out of the four [[Glasgow to Edinburgh Lines|rail links]] between Scotland's two biggest cities, hosting the flagship \"Shuttle\" service between {{Stnlnk|Glasgow Queen Street}} and {{Stnlnk|Edinburgh Waverley}}. A typical service calls at Glasgow Queen Street, Croy, Falkirk High, Haymarket and Edinburgh or Glasgow Queen Street, Falkirk High, Polmont, Linlithgow, Haymarket and Edinburgh.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway}}\n\nThe route has historic significance as it was Scotland's first inter-city railway, opening on 2 February 1842 as the [[Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway]].<ref name=robertson-3>Robertson(1983).

It was anticipated that electric [[British Rail Class 380|Class 380]] trains would start running from May 2017, followed by new [[British Rail Class 385|Class 385]] trains from September 2017. However, delays to the electrification project mean the 380s did not run until December 2017 and the 385s did not run until July 2018.\n\n== Places served ==\nThe route serves the following places ([[Ordnance Survey]] [[British national grid reference system|grid references]] for stations):\n\n{|-\n| '''Places''' || '''Grid references'''\n|-\n| [[Glasgow]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NS592655}}\n|-\n| [[Lenzie]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NS655719}}\n|-\n| [[Croy, North Lanarkshire|Croy]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NS729755}}\n|-\n| [[Falkirk]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NS882790}}\n|-\n| [[Polmont]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NS930781}}\n|-\n| [[Linlithgow]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NT005770}}\n|-\n| [[Haymarket, Edinburgh|Haymarket]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NT239731}}\n|-\n| [[Edinburgh]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NT257738}}\n|}\n\n==Services==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nPassenger services are operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]].

The \"(Glasgow Queen Street-Edinburgh Haymarket) Shuttle\" weekday day time service pattern sees a train every 15 minutes from Glasgow/Edinburgh. All trains stop at Falkirk High and Haymarket, with selected trains stopping at Croy, Polmont and Linlithgow.\n\nThe Sunday service sees a train every 30 minutes from Glasgow/Edinburgh with all trains calling at Falkirk High and Haymarket and a train every hour at Croy, Polmont and Linlithgow.

Also during this period, [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]] provided through services from Glasgow Queen Street to [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]] and various [[West Country]] destinations, resulting in the use of [[InterCity 125]]s on the route.\n\nAt this time, the service operated on a half-hourly frequency with all trains stopping at Haymarket and Falkirk High, with alternate trains stopping at Polmont and Linlithgow. Some peak hour trains stopped at Bishopbriggs, Lenzie and Croy. Sunday trains served {{Stnlnk|Falkirk Grahamston}}.\n\nIn 1984 the [[Polmont rail accident]], where a train hit a cow on the track (part of the cow's leg was trapped in the bogie of the train, lifting it off the track) resulted in 13 deaths and 61 injuries.

While ordinary kimono would usually be created by women at home, luxurious silk kimono were designed and created by specialist artists who were usually men.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=24}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection includes some white satin examples patterned with flowers, geometric patterns or emblems such as clouds or waves. These would have been worn as formal dress by samurai women.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}} The military connection is more explicit on a bright red kimono illustrated with {{lang|ja-Latn|gunbai}} [[Japanese war fan|war fans]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}}  Another kind of kimono specific to the military elite is the {{lang|ja-Latn|goshodoki}} or \"palace court style\", which would be worn in the residence of a military leader (a {{lang|ja-Latn|[[Sh\u014dgun|Shogun]]}} or {{lang|ja-Latn|[[daimy\u014d]]}}). These would have landscape scenes, among which there are other motifs usually referencing classic literature. The collection has several examples of this type, often with symbolism referring to stories made popular by [[Noh|Noh plays]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=35\u201344}} Samurai men would dress with a more understated design, exemplified by items in the collection with geometrical designs concentrated around the waist.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=76\u201378}} The {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}}, or sleeping kimono, is a thickly wadded form of wearable bedding. The Khalili Collection has some examples from samurai families: whereas {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}} would normally have simple designs, these are especially elaborate and are made of silk rather than the usual [[cotton]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=93\u201395}}\n\nOther items have rich decoration from the waist down only, and family emblems on the neck and shoulders: a style called {{lang|ja-Latn|tsuma moy\u014d}}. These would be worn by women of the merchant class.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=46\u201351}} The kimono of merchant-class women were more subdued than those of the samurai, but still with bold colours and designs representing nature.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=54}} Red was a popular colour for wealthy women, partly because of its cultural association with youth and passion, and partly because the dye{{snd}}derived from [[safflower]]<ref name=\":3\" />{{snd}}was very expensive, so a bright red garment was an ostentatious display of wealth.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=63}} Indian fabrics, brought to Japan by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] importers, were received with enthusiasm and found many uses. The collection includes a flamboyant under-kimono for a man made by combining these finely patterned fabrics with plain-weave silk and cotton.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=80}} Other items show that Japanese designers started printing designs that were influenced by the Indian patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=80\u201384}} Another example in the collection uses fabric imported from Britain or France: ownership of this exotic textile signified wealth and taste, but it was worn as an undergarment where the design would not be seen.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=87}}\n\nWorn by less wealthy merchants, lower down the social scale, are kimono made of cotton or [[ramie]] and dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]], with less dense designs but still a variety of dyes, patterns and techniques.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=96\u2013102}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX142.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) with a design inspired by the ''[[Eight Views of \u014cmi]]'', 1780\u20131820|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX230.jpg|Underkimono for a man ({{lang|ja-Latn|juban}}) using Indian fabrics, 1800\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX154.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}); landscape scene with bridge, pavilions and thatched huts, 1840\u20131870|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX149.jpg|Summer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|katabira}}) depicting a landscape with fishing nets, 1820\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\n</gallery>\n\n== Meiji era (1868\u20131912) ==\nThe Meiji era was a period of modernisation and industrialisation, during which Japan opened itself to the world.{{sfn|Guth|2015|pp=106\u2013107}} It saw a rapid introduction of Western culture to Japan, and also of Japanese culture into Europe and America, where kimono became an object of fascination.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=9}} The production of kimono started to use Western technologies such as [[Dye|synthetic dye]], and decoration was sometimes influenced by Western motifs.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=11}} The textile industry modernised rapidly and silk from Tokyo's factories became Japan's principal export.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}} Cheap synthetic dyes meant that bold purples and reds, previously restricted to the wealthy elite, could be owned by anyone.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} [[Emperor Meiji|The Emperor]] issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=112}} [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] journeyed to Europe and the United States and the books he wrote about Western clothing and customs were influential.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=113}} So Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women.{{sfn|Guth|2015|p=110}} In the 1890s the kimono reasserted itself, with people wearing bolder and brighter styles. A new type called the {{lang|ja-Latn|[[h\u014dmongi]]}} bridged the gap between formal dress and everyday dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection has items that illustrate the trends of the Meiji era. Several have a plain, bold colour with elaborate design around the hem.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} The technology of the time allowed for subtle [[Color gradient|colour gradients]] rather than abrupt changes of colour. Another trend was for outer and inner garments of the same design.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} One trend in the Meiji era was for women's under-kimono made by combining pieces of different fabric, sometimes of radically different colours and designs. The collection has examples of these.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=137}} For men, the trend was for highly decorative under-kimono that would be covered by outer kimono that were plain or very simply designed.

While ordinary kimono would usually be created by women at home, luxurious silk kimono were designed and created by specialist artists who were usually men.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=24}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection includes some white satin examples patterned with flowers, geometric patterns or emblems such as clouds or waves. These would have been worn as formal dress by samurai women.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}} The military connection is more explicit on a bright red kimono illustrated with {{lang|ja-Latn|gunbai}} [[Japanese war fan|war fans]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}}  Another kind of kimono specific to the military elite is the {{lang|ja-Latn|goshodoki}} or \"palace court style\", which would be worn in the residence of a military leader (a {{lang|ja-Latn|[[Sh\u014dgun|Shogun]]}} or {{lang|ja-Latn|[[daimy\u014d]]}}). These would have landscape scenes, among which there are other motifs usually referencing classic literature. The collection has several examples of this type, often with symbolism referring to stories made popular by [[Noh|Noh plays]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=35\u201344}} Samurai men would dress with a more understated design, exemplified by items in the collection with geometrical designs concentrated around the waist.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=76\u201378}} The {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}}, or sleeping kimono, is a thickly wadded form of wearable bedding. The Khalili Collection has some examples from samurai families: whereas {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}} would normally have simple designs, these are especially elaborate and are made of silk rather than the usual [[cotton]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=93\u201395}}\n\nOther items have rich decoration from the waist down only, and family emblems on the neck and shoulders: a style called {{lang|ja-Latn|tsuma moy\u014d}}. These would be worn by women of the merchant class.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=46\u201351}} The kimono of merchant-class women were more subdued than those of the samurai, but still with bold colours and designs representing nature.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=54}} Red was a popular colour for wealthy women, partly because of its cultural association with youth and passion, and partly because the dye{{snd}}derived from [[safflower]]<ref name=\":3\" />{{snd}}was very expensive, so a bright red garment was an ostentatious display of wealth.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=63}} Indian fabrics, brought to Japan by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] importers, were received with enthusiasm and found many uses. The collection includes a flamboyant under-kimono for a man made by combining these finely patterned fabrics with plain-weave silk and cotton.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=80}} Other items show that Japanese designers started printing designs that were influenced by the Indian patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=80\u201384}} Another example in the collection uses fabric imported from Britain or France: ownership of this exotic textile signified wealth and taste, but it was worn as an undergarment where the design would not be seen.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=87}}\n\nWorn by less wealthy merchants, lower down the social scale, are kimono made of cotton or [[ramie]] and dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]], with less dense designs but still a variety of dyes, patterns and techniques.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=96\u2013102}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX142.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) with a design inspired by the ''[[Eight Views of \u014cmi]]'', 1780\u20131820|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX230.jpg|Underkimono for a man ({{lang|ja-Latn|juban}}) using Indian fabrics, 1800\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX154.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}); landscape scene with bridge, pavilions and thatched huts, 1840\u20131870|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX149.jpg|Summer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|katabira}}) depicting a landscape with fishing nets, 1820\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\n</gallery>\n\n== Meiji era (1868\u20131912) ==\nThe Meiji era was a period of modernisation and industrialisation, during which Japan opened itself to the world.{{sfn|Guth|2015|pp=106\u2013107}} It saw a rapid introduction of Western culture to Japan, and also of Japanese culture into Europe and America, where kimono became an object of fascination.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=9}} The production of kimono started to use Western technologies such as [[Dye|synthetic dye]], and decoration was sometimes influenced by Western motifs.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=11}} The textile industry modernised rapidly and silk from Tokyo's factories became Japan's principal export.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}} Cheap synthetic dyes meant that bold purples and reds, previously restricted to the wealthy elite, could be owned by anyone.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} [[Emperor Meiji|The Emperor]] issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=112}} [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] journeyed to Europe and the United States and the books he wrote about Western clothing and customs were influential.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=113}} So Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women.{{sfn|Guth|2015|p=110}} In the 1890s the kimono reasserted itself, with people wearing bolder and brighter styles. A new type called the {{lang|ja-Latn|[[h\u014dmongi]]}} bridged the gap between formal dress and everyday dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection has items that illustrate the trends of the Meiji era. Several have a plain, bold colour with elaborate design around the hem.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} The technology of the time allowed for subtle [[Color gradient|colour gradients]] rather than abrupt changes of colour. Another trend was for outer and inner garments of the same design.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} One trend in the Meiji era was for women's under-kimono made by combining pieces of different fabric, sometimes of radically different colours and designs. The collection has examples of these.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=137}} For men, the trend was for highly decorative under-kimono that would be covered by outer kimono that were plain or very simply designed. Among the Khalili examples, an undergarment depicts performers and dancers among [[haiku]] poems. Another combines postcard-like scenes of Japan's progress with a textual diary of the Meiji era.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=138\u2013141}}\n\nEven the clothing of infants and young children used bold colours, intricate designs, and materials common to adult fashions. The collection has many examples, including a boy's kimono and under-kimono set, decorated with cranes and pine trees, and a girl's set that combines a deep blue outer garment with a bright red undergarment.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=142\u2013144}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX161.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks in pine trees, 1870-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX158.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) showing flowers on rafts, 1870-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX195.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks, 1880-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono K100.jpg|Outer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) with hanging scroll motifs, 1880\u20131890|alt=refer to caption\n</gallery>\n\n== Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods (1912\u20131950) ==\n\nThe early twentieth century brought a new mix on cultural influences, including greater [[Japanese nationalism|nationalism]] and greater Western influence; especially [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=163\u2013164}} The imagery on kimono{{snd}}particularly boys' kimono{{snd}}reflected this, with depictions of skyscrapers, cars or planes to celebrate the modern world.<ref name=\":3\" /> Kimono of these periods are distinguished by vibrant colours and an enormous variety of designs.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=160}} Mass-produced garments used [[Textile printing|printing]] to cheaply imitate traditional dyeing processes.<ref name=\"Atkins\" /> A type of inexpensive, durable, printed silk kimono known as {{lang|ja-Latn|meisen}} became very popular.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} Urban culture of the Taish\u014d period was marked by {{lang|ja-Latn|modanizumu}} (modernism) which celebrated Western art movements and fashion.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} In many aspects of Japanese culture, there was a tension between traditional, orthodox, Japanese influences and modern, Western, subversive influences.

These repeating patterns were achieved with stencil printing or by selective dyeing.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=180\u2013201}} As well as stripes and checks, the geometrical patterns used include [[arabesque]]s and [[swastika]]s.
