He was never on the [[disabled list]] in his career.\n\n==San Diego Padres (1983\u20131986)==\nThurmond was originally drafted by the [[San Diego Padres]] out of [[Texas A&M University]] in the 24th round of the [[1978 MLB Draft]], but he chose not to sign. He was then drafted by the Padres in the fifth round of the [[1979 MLB Draft]], and he signed that time. As a rookie in 1983, Thurmond went 7\u20133 with a 2.65 ERA, and he was tied for ninth in the 1983 NL Rookie of the Year Award voting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1983.shtml# |title=Baseball Awards Voting for 1983}}</ref> In 1984, he had the best season of his career, going 14\u20138 with a 2.97 ERA as the Padres won the [[National League West]]. \n\nHe lost Game 2 of the [[National League Championship Series]], giving up 4 runs in 3{{fraction|2|3}} innings,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1984/B10030CHN1984.htm |title=Chicago Cubs 4, San Diego Padres 2}}</ref> but it didn't matter in the end as the Padres overcame an 0\u20132 deficit in the series to beat the [[Chicago Cubs]] 3 games to 2. He was also the losing pitcher in Game 1 of the [[1984 World Series]] against the [[Detroit Tigers]], giving up only three runs, but only lasting 5 innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1984/B10090SDN1984.htm |title=Detroit Tigers 3, San Diego Padres 2}}</ref> Thurmond also started Game 5, and although he only lasted 1/3 of an inning, he gave up three runs again but earned a no-decision this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1984/B10140DET1984.htm |title=Detroit Tigers 8, San Diego Padres 4}}</ref> \n\nThe 1985 season was sort of a let-down for Thurmond, as he went 7\u201311 with a 3.97 ERA (an entire run higher than 1984) and only started 23 of his 36 games. In 1986, Thurmond got off to a very rocky start, going 3\u20137 with a 6.50 ERA in his first 17 games (15 starts). On July 9, 1986, he was traded to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for pitcher [[Dave LaPoint]].\n\n==Detroit Tigers (1986\u201387)==\nThurmond really turned things around upon his arrival in Detroit, although it was mostly in the bullpen. He finished the year with the Tigers 4\u20131, with a 1.92 ERA in 25 games (4 starts). His next season with the Tigers was the first in which he didn't start a single game, as he went 0\u20131 with a 4.23 ERA in 48 games out of the bullpen. He made his final playoff appearance in Game 4 of the [[1987 ALCS]], pitching 1/3 of an inning without giving up a run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1987/B10110DET1987.htm |title=Minnesota Twins 5, Detroit Tigers 3}}</ref> On February 26, 1988, the Tigers traded Thurmond to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for [[Ray Knight]].\n\n==Baltimore Orioles (1988\u201389)==\nThurmond's first season with the Orioles, like their season in 1988, wasn't that great. He went 1\u20138 with a 4.58 ERA in 43 games (6 starts) while the Orioles finished last in the [[American League]]. The following season was better for Thurmond, as he went 2\u20134 with a 3.90 ERA in 49 games while pitching almost entirely out of the bullpen.\n\n==Houston Astros (1990)==\nOn February 1, 1990, Thurmond signed with the [[Houston Astros]]. However, he didn't pitch with them at all. Instead, he pitched in nine games for the [[Tucson Toros]], the Astros' AAA affiliate, posting a 3.27 ERA with no decisions. On May 1, he was sent to the [[San Francisco Giants]] as part of a conditional deal.\n\n==San Francisco Giants (1990)==\nThurmond pitched reasonably well out of the bullpen for the Giants, going 2\u20133 with a 3.34 ERA in 43 games. However, 1990 was his final year in the major leagues. In 1991, he finished his career with the [[Phoenix Firebirds]], the Giants AAA affiliate, going 0\u20133 with a 3.42 ERA in 26 games.\n\n==Personal life==\nThurmond currently resides in [[Katy, Texas]], and works for an insurance business his father started.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2009/jun/27/84padscaps152624/ |title=Revisiting the Padres of '84}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{baseballstats|br=t/thurmma01|fangraphs=1013052|brm=thurmo001mar}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thurmond, Mark}}\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball pitchers]]\n[[Category:San Diego Padres players]]\n[[Category:Detroit Tigers players]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles players]]\n[[Category:San Francisco Giants players]]\n[[Category:Amarillo Gold Sox players]]\n[[Category:Hawaii Islanders players]]\n[[Category:Tucson Toros players]]\n[[Category:Phoenix Firebirds players]]\n[[Category:Las Vegas 51s players]]\n[[Category:Rochester Red Wings players]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from Texas]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Houston]]\n[[Category:Texas A&M Aggies baseball players]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American baseball player}}\n{{Infobox baseball biography\n| name       =Mark Thurmond\n| image      =\n| alt        =\n| caption    =\n| position   =[[Pitcher]]\n| birth_date  ={{Birth date and age|1956|09|12}}\n| birth_place =[[Houston, Texas]]\n| death_date  =\n| death_place =\n| bats       =Left\n| throws     =Left\n|debutleague = MLB\n| debutdate  =May 14\n| debutyear  =1983\n| debutteam  =San Diego Padres\n|finalleague = MLB\n| finaldate  =September 2\n| finalyear  =1990\n| finalteam  =San Francisco Giants\n| statyear   =\n|statleague = MLB\n| stat1label =[[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|Win\u2013loss record]]\n| stat1value =40\u201346\n| stat2label =[[Earned run average]]\n| stat2value =3.69\n| stat3label =[[Strikeout]]s\n| stat3value =320\n| awards     =\n| teams =\n*[[San Diego Padres]] ({{mlby|1983}}\u2013{{mlby|1986}})\n*[[Detroit Tigers]] ({{mlby|1986}}\u2013{{mlby|1987}})\n*[[Baltimore Orioles]] ({{mlby|1988}}\u2013{{mlby|1989}})\n*[[San Francisco Giants]] ({{mlby|1990}})\n}}\n{{MedalTableTop}}\n{{MedalSport | [[Baseball]]}}\n{{MedalCountry | the {{USA}} }}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[Baseball World Cup|Amateur World Series]]}}\n{{MedalSilver | [[1978 Amateur World Series|1978 Italy]] | [[United States national baseball team|Team]]}}\n{{MedalBottom}}\n'''Mark Anthony Thurmond''' (born September 12, 1956) is a former professional baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 1983 to 1990.

{"title_page": "Ticket resale", "text_new": "{{short description|Act of reselling tickets for admission to events}}\n{{Tone|date=April 2010}}\n'''Ticket resale''' (also known as '''ticket scalping''' or '''ticket touting''') is the act of reselling [[ticket (admission)|tickets for admission]] to events. Tickets are bought from licensed sellers and are then sold for a price determined by the individual or company in possession of the tickets. Tickets sold through secondary sources may be sold for less or more than their [[face value]] depending on demand, which tends to vary as the event date approaches. When the supply of tickets for a given event available through authorized ticket sellers is depleted, the event is considered \"sold out\", generally increasing the market value for any tickets on offer through secondary sellers. Ticket resale is common in both [[spectator sport|sporting]] and [[concert|musical events]].\n\n[[File:Dorgan cartoon about Ticket Scalping.jpg|thumb|right|In this 1920s cartoon by [[Tad Dorgan]], people wishing to attend a boxing match are told that all the good tickets were sold (to \"specs\" - that is, speculators) yesterday, even though the match was only announced that morning.]]\n\nTicket resale is a form of [[arbitrage]] that arises when the number demanded at the sale price exceeds the number supplied (that is, when event organizers charge less than the [[equilibrium price]]s for the tickets).\n\nDuring the 19th century, the term ''scalper'' was applied to railroad ticket brokers who sold tickets for lower rates.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/07/13/98565114.pdf|title=THE TRUNK LINE WARFARE -  WHAT THE RAILROAD PASSENGER AND TICKET AGENTS SAY. - View Article - NYTimes.com|date=13 July 1881|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Purchase and re-sale methods ==\nTicket re-sellers use several different means to secure premium and previously sold-out ticket inventories (potentially in large quantities) for events such as [[concert]]s or [[sporting event]]s. Established re-sellers may operate within networks of ticket contacts, including season ticket holders, individual ticket re-sellers, and ticket brokers. They make a business out of getting customers hard-to-find and previously sold-out tickets that are no longer available through the official box office.\n[[Image:Ticket scalper.jpg|thumb|right|A ticket scalper at work]]\n\nTicket scalpers (or [[Tout#Types of touts|ticket tout]]s in [[British English]]) work outside events, often showing up with unsold tickets from brokers' offices on a consignment basis or showing up without tickets and buying extra tickets from fans at or below face value on a speculative basis hoping to resell them at a profit. There are many full-time scalpers who are regulars at particular venues and may even have a pool of loyal buyers.\n\nOne common concern with resale is with scam artists selling fake tickets to unsuspecting buyers. Another common practice is scalpers that sell tickets that have already been scanned at the venue gate since entry is typically allowed only when a ticket is scanned for the first time.  Since the tickets were authentic, buyers do not have a way of telling if a ticket had been used or not.\n\nA concern when buying tickets on the street from a ticket scalper or via an online auction is that the tickets sold by ticket re-sellers may themselves be stolen or counterfeit.  For many major sporting events, counterfeit tickets are auctioned off in the months leading up to the event. These criminals and their activities are not to be confused with legitimate ticket brokers and individuals who abide by the law to legally resell tickets on the secondary market.\n\nIn 2009, [[Ticketmaster]] started adoption of a \"paperless\" restricted ticketing, in which tickets could not be resold. Under this system, customers prove their purchase by showing a credit card and ID.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ticketmaster.com/creditcardentry|title=Ticketmaster Credit Card Entry - Information and FAQs. Official Ticketmaster Site|website=www.ticketmaster.com|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref> The measure was taken in response to ticket scalping and resale markup of tickets on secondary markets and adopted during [[Wonder World Tour (Miley Cyrus)|Miley Cyrus (2009) World Wonder Tour]], although Ticketmaster first experimented it with [[AC/DC]]'s [[Black Ice World Tour]] (2008\u201310).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32898804/ns/business-retail/#.V27RyeYrJsM|title=Ticketmaster tries to cut out scalpers again|date=2009-09-17|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref><ref name=\"yahootickets\">{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/miley-cyrus/news/miley-cyrus-fights-scalpers-with-paperless-tickets--61720659 |title=Miley Cyrus Fights Scalpers with Paperless Tickets |date=June 21, 2009 |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |work=[[Yahoo!

The system requires large groups to enter together with the person who purchased tickets. Some events have Ticket Transfer which allows the tickets to change ownership and allow for tickets to be transferred through Ticketmaster's proprietary systems. These cannot be later resold or transferred via [[ticket exchange]]s such as [[StubHub]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ticketnews.com/stubhub-begins-warning-customers-that-some-paperless-ticket-sales-might-be-refunded/|title=StubHub begins warning customers that some paperless ticket sales might be refunded|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref>\n\n===Ticket presales===\n\n{{main|Sports ticket derivative}}\n\nObtaining tickets through special presales has become more common. These presales often use unique codes specific to an artist's fan club or venue. The advent of presales has allowed more individuals to participate in reselling tickets outside of a brokers office.\n\nAlthough [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] was a practice in use mostly in the 1980s, some ticket brokers offer tickets even before the tickets are officially available for sale. In such scenarios, those ticket re-sellers are actually selling [[forward contract]]s of those tickets.  One example is a company called TicketReserve, which is making money by selling \"[[option (finance)|options]]\" on future sporting events. This is often possible if the reseller is a season ticket holder. Season ticket holders generally receive the same exact seat locations year after year thus they can enter a contract to deliver on tickets that they own the rights to, even if those tickets have not even been printed or sent to the original ticket holder.\n\n===Automated scalping bots===\nIn recent years, fraudsters have started to use more complex methods by which they obtain tickets for resale on the secondary market. Similar to the technology used to snatch up rare shoes and sneakers,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/13/adidas-yeezy-collectors-sneakerheads-using-bots.html|title=An underground community of 'sneakerheads' is using bots to corner the market on rare sneakers\n|publisher=CNBC}}</ref> automated bot attacks have become a common way to acquire large numbers of tickets only to resell them for higher profits. What fraudsters will do is deploy thousands of bots from untraceable IP addresses in a brute force attack as soon as a venue or ticket seller first makes them available for sale. In 2017, one of the largest online ticket sellers Ticketmaster filed a lawsuit against Prestige Entertainment for their continued use of scalper bots despite paying $3.35&nbsp;million to the New York Attorney General's Office just a year prior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-02/ticketmaster-sues-broker-over-use-of-bots-to-buy-up-tickets|title=Ticketmaster Sues Broker Over Use of 'Bots' to Buy Up Tickets|publisher=Bloomberg}}</ref> Ticketmaster claimed that Prestige Entertainment was able to lock up 40% of available tickets for performances of the hit Broadway musical ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'', as well as a majority of the tickets Ticketmaster had available for the [[Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao|Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao fight]] in Las Vegas in 2015. In an effort to curtail such behavior, Congress moved to pass the [[Better Online Tickets Sales Act]] of 2016, more commonly referred to as the BOTS act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/business/media/ticket-scalping-bots-act.html|title=Congress Moves to Curb Ticket Scalping, Banning Bots Used Online|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref> The legislation was signed into law in December 2016 by then President Barack Obama. The BOTS act enforces several penalties and fines for parties found guilty of using bots or other technology for undermining online ticket seller systems with the hopes of selling them on the secondary ticket market.\n\n===Ticket brokering===\nTicket brokers operate out of offices and use the internet and phone call centers to conduct their business. They are different from scalpers since they offer a consumer-facing storefront to return to if there is any problem with their transaction. The majority of transactions that occur are via credit card over the phone or internet. Some brokers host their own websites and interact directly with customers. These brokers are able to offer additional services such as hotel accommodation and airfare to events. Other brokers partner with online [[ticket exchange]]s. These sites act as marketplaces that allow users to purchase tickets from a large network of brokers. Some brokers offer advice on the best way to buy tickets starting with the box office and working with a broker if tickets aren't available through the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketstogo.com/ticket-buying-advice.html|title=Ticket Buying Advice|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOnline ticket brokering is the resale of tickets through a web-based ticket brokering service. Prices on ticket brokering websites are determined by demand, availability, and the ticket reseller. Tickets sold through an online ticket brokering service may or may not be authorized by the official seller. Generally, the majority of trading on ticket brokering websites concerns itself with tickets to live entertainment events whereby the primary officially licensed seller's supply has been exhausted and the event has been declared \"sold-out\". Critics of the industry compare the resale of tickets online to \u2018ticket touting\u2019, \u2018scalping\u2019 or a variety of other terms for the unofficial sale of tickets directly outside the venue of an event.\n\nThe late 1990s and early 2000s saw the emergence of online ticket brokering as a lucrative business. U.S. corporate ticket reselling firm [[Ticketmaster]] developed a strong online presence and made several acquisitions to compete in the secondary markets. Securities analyst Joe Bonner, who tracks Ticketmaster's parent company New York-based IAC/InterActiveCorp, told USA Today: \"You have to look at the secondary market as something that is a real threat to Ticketmaster. They missed the boat. [[StubHub]] has been around a few years now already. They weren't as proactive as they probably should have been.\"<ref name=\"usatoday\">{{cite news|last=Milicia |first=Joe |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/2008-01-18-48774553_x.htm |title=Ticketmaster's near monopoly challenged as technology changes |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2008-01-19 |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref> Ticketmaster launched [[ticket exchange|fan to fan secondary ticket reselling]] site TicketExchange in November 2005.

If re-sellers buy the tickets and the tickets are not then sold out, then they risk a loss.<ref>[http://www.ticketnews.com/features/Guest-Commentary-The-importance-of-ticket-brokers121119629 TicketNews: Importance of Brokers]. Retrieved December 19, 2012.</ref> There may be individuals who wish to attend a popular event (and decide to sell their tickets later) and those that buy tickets in large quantities in order to resell their tickets for a profit. Some countries have restricted the unauthorized resale of tickets.\n\nIn 2008, Internet ticket fraud had emerged as global problem, when fake ticket websites defrauded millions of dollars from sports fans by selling [[Beijing Olympics 2008|Beijing Olympics]] tickets which they had no intention of delivering.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/09/olympicgames2008.internet|title=How boom in rogue ticket websites fleeces Britons &#124; Sport &#124; The Observer|date=2008-03-09|publisher=Guardian|location=London|first=Jamie|last=Doward|accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/latest-news/ticket-swindle-leaves-trail-of-losers/2008/08/03/1217701854125.html|title=Latest News - News - Olympics|date=2008-08-04|publisher=smh.com.au|accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Stephen Barrett]] of [[Quackwatch]], many online ticket resellers use [[URL]]s that are similar to official box-office websites, sometimes implying via their texts or their pictures that they are official, use [[internet advertising]] to increase traffic to their website, and don't clearly state the real prices they charge for a ticket.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/tickets.html |title=Don't Get Misled By Online Ticket Resellers |last=Barrett |first=Stephen |date=April 2, 2017 |website=Quackwatch |access-date=May 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== International responses ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\nIt is controversial whether tickets are goods which can be privately resold. Typically private resale will contravene the original conditions of sale, but it's legally questionable whether the original conditions of sale are even enforceable, however, most venues declare that they have the right to refuse entry to anyone.\n\n===Australia===\nDepending on the ticketing body's conditions of sale, tickets may be voided if they are resold for a profit. This is so with Ticketek tickets (Ticketek is an Australian-based ticketing company).  Efforts to clamp down on ticket resale have included labeling tickets with the name or a photograph of the buyer,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6251955.stm |title=New bid to stop Glastonbury touts |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-01-11 |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref> and banning people without tickets from the vicinity of the event to prevent the purchase of secondary market tickets.\n\nIn Australia, the secondary ticket market has been put under much scrutiny in the past few years as ticket scalpers dominated the resale ticket market. Scalpers would purchase tickets in bulk from the promoter hoping that the tickets would sell out causing an increase in demand for tickets and thus an increase in the ticket price. This caused event promoters to put restrictions on the number of tickets that can be purchased in one transaction, which has greatly reduced unfair ticket pricing. After many complaints from the community and event promoters, the DFT (Department of Fair Trading) and CCAAC (Commonwealth Consumer Affairs Advisory Council) conducted a survey discussing scalping issues and released The Ticket Scalping Issue Paper for NSW.<ref>http://www.treasury.gov.au/documents/1821/PDF/CCAAC_Issues_Paper_Ticket_scalping_ticket_onselling_and_consumers.pdf</ref>\n\nIn Victoria, some events are declared as \"major events\" and protected by the Major Events Act 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://djpr.vic.gov.au/ticket-scalping/legislation|title=Legislation|website=djpr.vic.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nQuebec put into law \"Bill 25\" in June 2012, making it illegal for ticket brokers to resell a ticket for more than the face value of the ticket without first obtaining permission from the ticket's original vendor. Brokers reselling tickets are required to inform consumers the tickets are being resold and must tell consumers the name of the ticket's original vendor and the original face value price. The penalty to violating the law includes fines of $1,000 to $2,000 for the first offense, and as much as $200,000 for repeated violations.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.ticketnews.com/news/stringent-quebec-ticket-resale-law-goes-into-effect061211846 |title= Stringent Quebec ticket resale law goes into effect |publisher= Ticket News  |accessdate=2012-06-28}}</ref>\n\nIn Ontario, re-selling the tickets above face value is prohibited by the Ticket Speculation Act and is punishable by a fine of $5,000 for an individual (including those buying the tickets above face) or $50,000 for a corporation.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Government of Ontario]]|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90t07_e.htm|title=Ticket Speculation Act|accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nEffective July 1, 2015, in an effort to protect consumers from purchasing fraudulent tickets, Ontario created an exemption under the Ticket Speculation Act to:\n* Enable official ticket sellers to authenticate tickets that are being resold\n* Permit tickets to be resold above face value in circumstances where tickets are authenticated or have a money-back guarantee\n* Allow tickets to be resold at a price that includes any service fees paid when the ticket was first purchased.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.ontario.ca/mag/en/2015/06/ontario-protecting-consumers-in-the-resale-ticket-market.html|title=Newsroom : Ontario Protecting Consumers in the Resale Ticket Market|work=news.ontario.ca}}</ref>\n\nFollowing an announcement in 2016 that [[The Tragically Hip]]'s lead singer [[Gord Downie]] had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, the band held the [[Man Machine Poem Tour]].

The new addition to the penal code enabled police to fight the ticket scalping of sports and music events (especially those scalpers that bought massive numbers of tickets for the sole purpose of resale), which were causing much distress to the public and enabled scalpers to evade paying taxes, but since no law strictly outlawed the practice, could not be legally fought prior to the new law.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://knesset.gov.il/tql/knesset_new/knesset15/HTML_28_03_2012_09-20-03-AM/20010718@225-01JUL18@021.html |title= Israeli Knesset debate prior to enacting the 67th amendment to the Israeli Penal Code |publisher= Israeli Knesset}}</ref>\n\n===Sweden===\nTicket resale by scalpers above face value is legal in Sweden regardless of limitations imposed by event organizer.<ref>Svartbiljetter kan f\u00f6rbjudas, Sydsvenskan 7 September 2010 http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur--nojen/svartbiljetter-kan-forbjudas/</ref><ref>Koll p\u00e5 konsertbiljettsk\u00f6pet?, Konsumentv\u00e4rket, retrieved 18 June 2014 http://www.konsumentverket.se/Om-oss/Nyheter-och-aktuella-fragor/Pressmeddelanden/Pressmeddelanden-2014/Koll-pa-konsertbiljettskopet/</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] resale of football tickets is illegal under section 166 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] unless the resale is authorized by the organizer of the match.

Tickets are bought from licensed sellers and are then sold for a price determined by the individual or company in possession of the tickets. Tickets sold through secondary sources may be sold for less or more than their [[face value]] depending on demand, which tends to vary as the event date approaches. When the supply of tickets for a given event available through authorized ticket sellers is depleted, the event is considered \"sold out\", generally increasing the market value for any tickets on offer through secondary sellers. Ticket resale is common in both [[spectator sport|sporting]] and [[concert|musical events]].\n\n[[File:Dorgan cartoon about Ticket Scalping.jpg|thumb|right|In this 1920s cartoon by [[Tad Dorgan]], people wishing to attend a boxing match are told that all the good tickets were sold (to \"specs\" - that is, speculators) yesterday, even though the match was only announced that morning.]]\n\nTicket resale is a form of [[arbitrage]] that arises when the number demanded at the sale price exceeds the number supplied (that is, when event organizers charge less than the [[equilibrium price]]s for the tickets).\n\nDuring the 19th century, the term ''scalper'' was applied to railroad ticket brokers who sold tickets for lower rates.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/07/13/98565114.pdf|title=THE TRUNK LINE WARFARE -  WHAT THE RAILROAD PASSENGER AND TICKET AGENTS SAY. - View Article - NYTimes.com|date=13 July 1881|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Purchase and re-sale methods ==\nTicket re-sellers use several different means to secure premium and previously sold-out ticket inventories (potentially in large quantities) for events such as [[concert]]s or [[sporting event]]s. Established re-sellers may operate within networks of ticket contacts, including season ticket holders, individual ticket re-sellers, and ticket brokers. They make a business out of getting customers hard-to-find and previously sold-out tickets that are no longer available through the official box office.\n[[Image:Ticket scalper.jpg|thumb|right|A ticket scalper at work]]\n\nTicket scalpers (or [[Tout#Types of touts|ticket tout]]s in [[British English]]) work outside events, often showing up with unsold tickets from brokers' offices on a consignment basis or showing up without tickets and buying extra tickets from fans at or below face value on a speculative basis hoping to resell them at a profit. There are many full-time scalpers who are regulars at particular venues and may even have a pool of loyal buyers.\n\nOne common concern with resale is with scam artists selling fake tickets to unsuspecting buyers. Another common practice is scalpers that sell tickets that have already been scanned at the venue gate since entry is typically allowed only when a ticket is scanned for the first time.  Since the tickets were authentic, buyers do not have a way of telling if a ticket had been used or not.\n\nA concern when buying tickets on the street from a ticket scalper or via an online auction is that the tickets sold by ticket re-sellers may themselves be stolen or counterfeit.  For many major sporting events, counterfeit tickets are auctioned off in the months leading up to the event. These criminals and their activities are not to be confused with legitimate ticket brokers and individuals who abide by the law to legally resell tickets on the secondary market.\n\nIn 2009, [[Ticketmaster]] started adoption of a \"paperless\" restricted ticketing, in which tickets could not be resold. Under this system, customers prove their purchase by showing a credit card and ID.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ticketmaster.com/creditcardentry|title=Ticketmaster Credit Card Entry - Information and FAQs. Official Ticketmaster Site|website=www.ticketmaster.com|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref> The measure was taken in response to ticket scalping and resale markup of tickets on secondary markets and adopted during [[Wonder World Tour (Miley Cyrus)|Miley Cyrus (2009) World Wonder Tour]], although Ticketmaster first experimented it with [[AC/DC]]'s [[Black Ice World Tour]] (2008\u201310).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32898804/ns/business-retail/#.V27RyeYrJsM|title=Ticketmaster tries to cut out scalpers again|date=2009-09-17|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref><ref name=\"yahootickets\">{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/miley-cyrus/news/miley-cyrus-fights-scalpers-with-paperless-tickets--61720659 |title=Miley Cyrus Fights Scalpers with Paperless Tickets |date=June 21, 2009 |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |work=[[Yahoo!

The system requires large groups to enter together with the person who purchased tickets. Some events have Ticket Transfer which allows the tickets to change ownership and allow for tickets to be transferred through Ticketmaster's proprietary systems. These cannot be later resold or transferred via [[ticket exchange]]s such as [[StubHub]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ticketnews.com/stubhub-begins-warning-customers-that-some-paperless-ticket-sales-might-be-refunded/|title=StubHub begins warning customers that some paperless ticket sales might be refunded|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref>\n\n===Ticket presales===\n\n{{main|Sports ticket derivative}}\n\nObtaining tickets through special presales has become more common. These presales often use unique codes specific to an artist's fan club or venue. The advent of presales has allowed more individuals to participate in reselling tickets outside of a brokers office.\n\nAlthough [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] was a practice in use mostly in the 1980s, some ticket brokers offer tickets even before the tickets are officially available for sale. In such scenarios, those ticket re-sellers are actually selling [[forward contract]]s of those tickets.  One example is a company called TicketReserve, which is making money by selling \"[[option (finance)|options]]\" on future sporting events. This is often possible if the reseller is a season ticket holder. Season ticket holders generally receive the same exact seat locations year after year thus they can enter a contract to deliver on tickets that they own the rights to, even if those tickets have not even been printed or sent to the original ticket holder.\n\n===Automated scalping bots===\nIn recent years, fraudsters have started to use more complex methods by which they obtain tickets for resale on the secondary market. Similar to the technology used to snatch up rare shoes and sneakers,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/13/adidas-yeezy-collectors-sneakerheads-using-bots.html|title=An underground community of 'sneakerheads' is using bots to corner the market on rare sneakers\n|publisher=CNBC}}</ref> automated bot attacks have become a common way to acquire large numbers of tickets only to resell them for higher profits. What fraudsters will do is deploy thousands of bots from untraceable IP addresses in a brute force attack as soon as a venue or ticket seller first makes them available for sale. In 2017, one of the largest online ticket sellers Ticketmaster filed a lawsuit against Prestige Entertainment for their continued use of scalper bots despite paying $3.35 million to the New York Attorney General's Office just a year prior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-02/ticketmaster-sues-broker-over-use-of-bots-to-buy-up-tickets|title=Ticketmaster Sues Broker Over Use of 'Bots' to Buy Up Tickets|publisher=Bloomberg}}</ref> Ticketmaster claimed that Prestige Entertainment was able to lock up 40% of available tickets for performances of the hit Broadway musical ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'', as well as a majority of the tickets Ticketmaster had available for the [[Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao|Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao fight]] in Las Vegas in 2015. In an effort to curtail such behavior, Congress moved to pass the [[Better Online Tickets Sales Act]] of 2016, more commonly referred to as the BOTS act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/business/media/ticket-scalping-bots-act.html|title=Congress Moves to Curb Ticket Scalping, Banning Bots Used Online|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref> The legislation was signed into law in December 2016 by then President Barack Obama. The BOTS act enforces several penalties and fines for parties found guilty of using bots or other technology for undermining online ticket seller systems with the hopes of selling them on the secondary ticket market.\n\n===Ticket brokering===\nTicket brokers operate out of offices and use the internet and phone call centers to conduct their business. They are different from scalpers since they offer a consumer-facing storefront to return to if there is any problem with their transaction. The majority of transactions that occur are via credit card over the phone or internet. Some brokers host their own websites and interact directly with customers. These brokers are able to offer additional services such as hotel accommodation and airfare to events. Other brokers partner with online [[ticket exchange]]s. These sites act as marketplaces that allow users to purchase tickets from a large network of brokers. Some brokers offer advice on the best way to buy tickets starting with the box office and working with a broker if tickets aren't available through the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketstogo.com/ticket-buying-advice.html|title=Ticket Buying Advice|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOnline ticket brokering is the resale of tickets through a web-based ticket brokering service. Prices on ticket brokering websites are determined by demand, availability, and the ticket reseller. Tickets sold through an online ticket brokering service may or may not be authorized by the official seller. Generally, the majority of trading on ticket brokering websites concerns itself with tickets to live entertainment events whereby the primary officially licensed seller's supply has been exhausted and the event has been declared \"sold-out\". Critics of the industry compare the resale of tickets online to \u2018ticket touting\u2019, \u2018scalping\u2019 or a variety of other terms for the unofficial sale of tickets directly outside the venue of an event.\n\nThe late 1990s and early 2000s saw the emergence of online ticket brokering as a lucrative business. U.S. corporate ticket reselling firm [[Ticketmaster]] developed a strong online presence and made several acquisitions to compete in the secondary markets. Securities analyst Joe Bonner, who tracks Ticketmaster's parent company New York-based IAC/InterActiveCorp, told USA Today: \"You have to look at the secondary market as something that is a real threat to Ticketmaster. They missed the boat. [[StubHub]] has been around a few years now already.

Some countries have restricted the unauthorized resale of tickets.\n\nIn 2008, Internet ticket fraud had emerged as global problem, when fake ticket websites defrauded millions of dollars from sports fans by selling [[Beijing Olympics 2008|Beijing Olympics]] tickets which they had no intention of delivering.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/09/olympicgames2008.internet|title=How boom in rogue ticket websites fleeces Britons &#124; Sport &#124; The Observer|date=2008-03-09|publisher=Guardian|location=London|first=Jamie|last=Doward|accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/latest-news/ticket-swindle-leaves-trail-of-losers/2008/08/03/1217701854125.html|title=Latest News - News - Olympics|date=2008-08-04|publisher=smh.com.au|accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Stephen Barrett]] of [[Quackwatch]], many online ticket resellers use [[URL]]s that are similar to official box-office websites, sometimes implying via their texts or their pictures that they are official, use [[internet advertising]] to increase traffic to their website, and don't clearly state the real prices they charge for a ticket.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/tickets.html |title=Don't Get Misled By Online Ticket Resellers |last=Barrett |first=Stephen |date=April 2, 2017 |website=Quackwatch |access-date=May 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== International responses ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\nIt is controversial whether tickets are goods which can be privately resold. Typically private resale will contravene the original conditions of sale, but it's legally questionable whether the original conditions of sale are even enforceable, however, most venues declare that they have the right to refuse entry to anyone.\n\n===Australia===\nDepending on the ticketing body's conditions of sale, tickets may be voided if they are resold for a profit. This is so with Ticketek tickets (Ticketek is an Australian-based ticketing company).  Efforts to clamp down on ticket resale have included labeling tickets with the name or a photograph of the buyer,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6251955.stm |title=New bid to stop Glastonbury touts |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-01-11 |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref> and banning people without tickets from the vicinity of the event to prevent the purchase of secondary market tickets.\n\nIn Australia, the secondary ticket market has been put under much scrutiny in the past few years as ticket scalpers dominated the resale ticket market. Scalpers would purchase tickets in bulk from the promoter hoping that the tickets would sell out causing an increase in demand for tickets and thus an increase in the ticket price. This caused event promoters to put restrictions on the number of tickets that can be purchased in one transaction, which has greatly reduced unfair ticket pricing. After many complaints from the community and event promoters, the DFT (Department of Fair Trading) and CCAAC (Commonwealth Consumer Affairs Advisory Council) conducted a survey discussing scalping issues and released The Ticket Scalping Issue Paper for NSW.<ref>http://www.treasury.gov.au/documents/1821/PDF/CCAAC_Issues_Paper_Ticket_scalping_ticket_onselling_and_consumers.pdf</ref>\n\nIn Victoria, some events are declared as \"major events\" and protected by the Major Events Act 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://djpr.vic.gov.au/ticket-scalping/legislation|title=Legislation|website=djpr.vic.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nQuebec put into law \"Bill 25\" in June 2012, making it illegal for ticket brokers to resell a ticket for more than the face value of the ticket without first obtaining permission from the ticket's original vendor.

At 60\u00b018\u2032N, the border proceeds away from the 141st meridian west in a southeastwardly direction and follows the [[St. Elias Mountains]].  South of the [[60th parallel north]], the border continues into British Columbia.  The entire Canada\u2013U.S. border in [[Yukon]] is shared with the U.S. state of [[Alaska]].\n\n===British Columbia===\nBritish Columbia has two international borders with the United States; one with the state of Alaska, and one at the southern end with the northwestern continental United States.\n\nThe former, continuing from the Yukon-Alaska border, proceeds through the St. Elias Mountains. Afterwards, at [[Mt. Fairweather]] at 58\u00b054\u2032N, 137\u00b031\u2032W, the border heads northwestwards towards the [[Coast Mountains]].  Afterwards, at 59\u00b048\u2032N, 135\u00b028\u2032W, the border heads in a generally southeastwardly direction along the Coast Mountains.  The border eventually reaches the [[Portland Canal]], and follows it outward to the [[Dixon Entrance]].  The border then follows the Dixon Entrance out into the [[Pacific Ocean]], and terminates upon reaching [[international waters]].\n\nThe latter begins at the terminus of international waters in the Pacific Ocean southwest of [[Vancouver Island]] and northwest of the [[Olympic Peninsula]].  It follows the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] eastward and then turns northeastward to enter [[Haro Strait]]. The border follows this strait in a northerly direction and turns sharply in an easterly direction through [[Boundary Pass]], separating the Canadian [[Gulf Islands]] from the American [[San Juan Islands]]. Upon reaching the [[Strait of Georgia]], the border turns due north and then to a northwesterly direction, bisecting this strait until the [[49th parallel north]]. At this parallel, the border makes a sharp turn to a due eastbound direction, and follows the parallel across the [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen Peninsula]], separating [[Point Roberts, Washington]] from [[Delta, British Columbia]], and continues into [[Alberta]].  This border, going from west to east, is shared with the U.S. states of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]].\n\n===Alberta===\nThe entire Canada\u2013U.S. border in the Canadian province of Alberta lies on the 49th parallel north.

At the eastern end, however, the border briefly enters the [[Lake of the Woods]], turns north at 48\u00b059\u2032N, 95\u00b009\u2032W, continues into land along the western end of Minnesota's [[Northwest Angle]], and continues into Ontario at 49\u00b023\u2032N, 95\u00b009\u2032W.  This border, going from west to east, is shared with the U.S. states of North Dakota and [[Minnesota]].\n\n===Ontario===\nThe border begins at the northwesternmost point of Minnesota's Northwest Angle 49\u00b023\u2032N, 95\u00b009\u2032W, and proceeds in an easterly direction through the Angle Inlet into the Lake of the Woods.  At 41\u00b019\u2032N, 94\u00b048\u2032W in the Lake of the Woods, the border turns to a southerly direction, and continues into the [[Rainy River (Minnesota\u2013Ontario)|Rainy River]].  The border then follows the Rainy River to [[Rainy Lake]], then subsequently through numerous small lakes, including Lake Namakan, [[Lac la Croix]], and [[Sea Gull Lake]], until reaching the [[Pigeon River (Minnesota-Ontario)|Pigeon River]], which leads it out into [[Lake Superior]].

The border then heads in a southerly direction through Lake Huron until reaching the [[St. Clair River]], which subsequently leads it to [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]].  The border then proceeds through Lake St. Clair, reaching the [[Detroit River]], which leads it to [[Lake Erie]].  The border then proceeds through Lake Erie into the [[Niagara River]], which leads into [[Lake Ontario]].  The border then proceeds in a northwesterly direction in Lake Ontario, then at 43\u00b027\u2032N, 79\u00b012\u2032W, the border makes a sharp turn to a north easterly direction.  The border then reaches and proceeds through the [[St. Lawrence River]]. Finally, at 45\u00b000\u2032N, 74\u00b040\u2032E, the border splits from the St. Lawrence River and continues into [[Quebec]].  This border, going from west to east, is shared with the U.S. states of Minnesota, [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\n===Quebec===\nThe border begins in the St. Lawrence River, continuing from the Ontario-New York border, at the [[45th parallel north]], the border heads inland in an easterly direction, remaining on or near the parallel. At 45\u00b000\u2032N, 71\u00b030\u2032W, the border begins to follow various natural features of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].  It continues to do so until 46\u00b025\u2032N, 70\u00b003\u2032W, where it begins to follow a northerly direction, followed by a northeasterly direction at 46\u00b041\u2032N, 69\u00b059\u2032W.  Afterwards, at 47\u00b027\u2032N, 69\u00b013\u2032E the border heads toward [[Beau Lake]].  Finally, after the border proceeds through Beau Lake, it continues into [[New Brunswick]].  This border, going from west to east, is shared with the U.S. states of New York, [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Maine]].\n\n===New Brunswick===\nThe border begins at the southern tip of Beau Lake at 47\u00b018\u2032N, 69\u00b003\u2032W and proceeds to the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]]. The border then proceeds through the Saint John River until 47\u00b004\u2032N, 67\u00b047\u2032W, where it splits from the river and heads southward. Then, at 45\u00b056\u2032N, 67\u00b047\u2032W heads into the [[Chiputneticook Lakes]], which subsequently lead it to the St. Croix River.  The border then proceeds through the [[St. Croix River (Maine \u2013 New Brunswick)|St. Croix River]] to [[Passamaquoddy Bay]], which in turn leads it past [[Grand Manan Island]] into the middle of the [[Bay of Fundy]], where it turns in a southerly direction and then terminates upon reaching international waters.

He often uses his four-seam fastball up in the zone to hitters. This has allowed him to strike out more batters with that pitch than any others. His slider has evolved throughout his career. In his early years, his slider was in the mid-80s with a larger break. However, in recent years, Verlander has added velocity to his slider. This change has caused a later, sharper break that has led many to believe it is actually a [[Cut fastball|cutter]], although Verlander has denied this on various occasions. In 2017, Verlander began to incorporate both sliders. He usually throws the slower, longer slider under the hands of lefties, and the sharper, faster slider down and away to righties. His 12\u20136 curveball has always been a dominant pitch that buckles hitters' knees at any point in the count. He also intentionally uses this pitch up in the zone at times to freeze hitters or throw off their timing.  Since the 2016 season, Verlander has essentially become a three-pitch pitcher (fastball, slider, curveball). His changeup has been used almost exclusively against left-handed batters in recent years, and its usage has dropped considerably. The changeup accounted for 8.5 percent of his pitches in 2016, only 4 percent of his pitches in 2017, and less than 2 percent of his pitches in 2018.\n\nVerlander is known for his unusual ability to \"add\" and \"subtract\" from his fastball velocity at any point in the game, giving him the ability to throw it in the upper 90s even in the late innings of games. Since 2008, Verlander has thrown pitches of over 100+ mph in the 8th inning or later 44 times, 39 more times than [[James Paxton (baseball)|James Paxton]] who is second on the list.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=Foolish Baseball|title=Justin Verlander's Impossible Inning: A Study in Velocity and Spin Rate l Baseball Bits|date=2018-12-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpIs__45t5I|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> This is despite the fact that he has thrown the most pitches in the major leagues since the beginning of the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/joe_lemire/05/02/justin.verlander.velocity/index.html |title=Detroit Tigers' Justin Verlander defies conventional wisdom \u2013 Joe Lemire \u2013 SI.com |last=Lemire |first=Joe |date=May 2, 2012 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=August 6, 2012 }}</ref> After a couple of injury prone seasons, many believed Verlander had lost the velocity most fans had grown accustomed to.

[[pitcher]] for the [[Houston Astros]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). He has also played in MLB for the [[Detroit Tigers]].\n\nFrom [[Manakin-Sabot, Virginia]], Verlander attended [[Old Dominion University]] (ODU) and played [[college baseball]] for the [[Old Dominion Monarchs baseball|Monarchs]]. He broke the Monarchs' and [[Colonial Athletic Association]]'s career records for [[strikeout]]s.  At the [[2003 Pan American Games]], Verlander helped lead the [[United States national baseball team|United States national team]] to a [[silver medal]].\n\nThe Tigers selected Verlander with the second overall pick of the [[2004 Major League Baseball draft|2004 MLB draft]]. He made his major league debut with the Tigers in 2005, and played there for 12 years as the [[Ace (baseball)|ace]] in their starting rotation, as a key figure in four consecutive [[American League Central|American League (AL) Central]] division championships (from 2011 to 2014) and two [[American League Championship Series|AL Pennants]] (in 2006 and 2012). He is among the career pitching leaders for the Tigers, including ranking second in strikeouts (2,373), seventh in [[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|wins]] (183), and eighth in [[innings pitched]] (2,511). The Tigers traded Verlander to the Astros before the 2017 trade deadline, and he went undefeated in his first five starts heading into the postseason. He was named [[League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]], and was co-winner of the [[Babe Ruth Award]] as the Astros won the [[2017 World Series]]. In 2018, Verlander became the 114th pitcher in major league history to earn 200 career wins, also becoming the 20th-fastest to reach the milestone (412 starts).<ref name=JV-200th>{{cite web |last=McTaggart |first=Brian |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/justin-verlanders-200th-win-has-astros-in-1st/c-291015284 |title=Verlander's 200th win puts Astros alone in first |publisher=[[MLB.com]] |date=August 19, 2018 |accessdate=August 21, 2018}}</ref> In 2019, Verlander became the sixth pitcher in MLB history to throw three career no-hitters<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hascup |first1=Jimmy |title=Astros starter Justin Verlander throws no-hitter against Blue Jays |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2019/09/01/justin-verlander-no-hitter-blue-jays/2187900001/ |website=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=1 September 2019 }}</ref> and struck out his 3,000th batter, becoming the 18th pitcher in major league history to do so.\n\nVerlander is an eight-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]], and has led the AL in strikeouts five times, and in [[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|wins]] twice.

On May 17, 2002, he struck out a then-school record 17 batters against James Madison. In 2003, he set a school single-season record by recording 139 [[strikeouts]]. In 2004, he broke his own record and established a new [[Colonial Athletic Association]] (CAA) record with 151 strikeouts.

Verlander was named the ODU Alumni Association's Male Athlete of the Year in 2004, and was the second overall pick in the [[2004 Major League Baseball draft]] by the [[Detroit Tigers]].\n\n===Minor leagues===\nVerlander's professional baseball career began when the [[Detroit Tigers]] selected him second overall in the [[2004 Major League Baseball draft|2004 MLB Draft]]. He signed a contract on October 25, 2004. Verlander made his professional debut in 2005. He played for two of Detroit's minor league affiliates: the [[Lakeland Flying Tigers]] (A+) and the [[Erie SeaWolves]] (AA), and also started two games for the Tigers in July. After posting a 9\u20132 record and a 1.67 ERA in 13 starts for Lakeland, Verlander joined the SeaWolves on June 20.\n\nOn July 4, 2005, Verlander started against the [[Cleveland Indians]] and pitched 5\u2153 innings, gave up four runs and was charged with a loss. He also made a start against the [[Minnesota Twins]] 19 days later. Verlander lost both of his major league starts in 2005, but in seven starts with Erie, he was 2\u20130 and his ERA was 0.28. Tightness in his right shoulder caused Verlander's season to end in early August when he was placed on the [[disabled list]]. Verlander was recognized as a [[Florida State League]] all\u2013star, was a starting pitcher in the [[All-Star Futures Game|Futures Game]] and, according to ''[[Baseball America]]'', was Detroit's highest rated prospect.<ref name=\"Information Guide\" />\n\n===Detroit Tigers===\n\n====2005\u20132006: MLB debut and AL Rookie of the Year====\nVerlander made his MLB debut on July 4, 2005.

He often uses his four-seam fastball up in the zone to hitters. This has allowed him to strike out more batters with that pitch than any others. His slider has evolved throughout his career. In his early years, his slider was in the mid-80s with a larger break. However, in recent years, Verlander has added velocity to his slider. This change has caused a later, sharper break that has led many to believe it is actually a [[Cut fastball|cutter]], although Verlander has denied this on various occasions. In 2017, Verlander began to incorporate both sliders. He usually throws the slower, longer slider under the hands of lefties, and the sharper, faster slider down and away to righties. His 12\u20136 curveball has always been a dominant pitch that buckles hitters' knees at any point in the count. He also intentionally uses this pitch up in the zone at times to freeze hitters or throw off their timing.  Since the 2016 season, Verlander has essentially become a three-pitch pitcher (fastball, slider, curveball). His changeup has been used almost exclusively against left-handed batters in recent years, and its usage has dropped considerably. The changeup accounted for 8.5 percent of his pitches in 2016, only 4 percent of his pitches in 2017, and less than 2 percent of his pitches in 2018.\n\nVerlander is known for his unusual ability to \"add\" and \"subtract\" from his fastball velocity at any point in the game, giving him the ability to throw it in the upper 90s even in the late innings of games.

They became the 6th team to win the Christy Ring Cup.\n\nKerry's Christy Ring Cup defeat was their second having already lost the final in [[2010 Christy Ring Cup Final|2010]].\n\n==Match==\n===Details===\n\n{{Football box\n|date = 8 June 2013\n|time = 16:00\n|team1 = [[Down GAA|Down]] [[File: Colours of Down.svg|20px|border]]\n|score = 3-16 - 2-17\n|aet =\n|report = [http://munster.gaa.ie/2013/05/04/christy-ring-cup-down-v-kerry/ Report]\n|team2 = [[File: Colours of Kerry.svg|20px|border]] [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]]\n|goals1 = G Johnson 2-1, S Nicholson 1-2, P Braniff 0-6 (4f, 1 pen), J Coyle, C Woods (1f, 1 '65') 0-2 each, D Hughes, D Toner, J McCusker 0-1 each.\n|goals2 = S Nolan 1-9 (0-5f), P Boyle 1-3, W O'Dwyer 0-2, B O'Leary, A Boyle, G O'Brien 0-1 each.\n|stadium = [[Croke Park]], [[Dublin]]\n|attendance =\n|referee = C Browne ([[Galway GAA|Galway]])\n}}\n\n{| width=92% |\n|-\n|{{Football kit\n  |pattern_la = _blackline\n |pattern_b  = _down14\n |pattern_ra = _blackline\n |pattern_so = _aguianegra15h\n |pattern_sh = _adidasred\n |leftarm    = EE0000\n |body       = EE0000\n |rightarm   = EE0000\n |shorts     = 000000\n |socks      = 000000\n | title      = Down\n}}\n|{{Football kit\n| pattern_la = _kerry15\n| pattern_b = _kerry15\n| pattern_ra = _kerry15\n| pattern_sh = _adidasonwhite\n| pattern_so = _color_3_stripes_gold\n| leftarm = 006844\n| body = 006844\n| rightarm = 006844\n| shorts = 006844\n| socks = 006844\n| title      = Kerry\n}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Christy Ring Cup}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n\n[[Category:2013 in hurling|Christy Ring Cup Final]]\n[[Category:Christy Ring Cup Finals]]\n[[Category:Kerry GAA matches]]\n[[Category:Down GAA matches]]\n", "name_user": "Dewritech", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up,typo(s) fixed: 3-16 \u2192 3\u201316 (3), \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Christy_Ring_Cup_Final"}
