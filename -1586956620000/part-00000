It stars its creator as an [[anthropomorphic]] orange who annoys fruits, vegetables, and various other objects by using jokes and puns, which are sometimes [[Incivility|crude]].\n\nThe show became popular, later leading to its becoming the subject of a [[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange|TV series]], a [[Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage|video game]], a range of toys, backpacks, couches, pillows, blankets, lunchboxes, drink bottles, mattresses, towels, and a T-shirt line. Other accessories, such as costumes of the series' characters, have also appeared on the market for the company.\n\nSince its inception, the ''Annoying Orange'' [[YouTube]] channel has amassed over 9 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/annoying-orange-creator-takes-collective-ds-to-court/| title=Annoying Orange Creator Takes Collective DS To Court| last=Kiley| first=Rachel| date=December 23, 2014| publisher=NMR| access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show is centered on Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]), who resides on a fruit cart display in a kitchen with other objects such as his best friend, Pear, an irritable but geeky [[Williams pear|Bartlett pear]] (also voiced by Boedigheimer). Other fruits include Passion, a sensible [[passion fruit]] and Orange's love interest played by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]], an arrogant [[grapefruit]] (voiced by Bob Jennings), a tiny but hot-blooded [[Red delicious apple]] known as Midget Apple (though he prefers the name Little Apple), a happy-go-lucky and slightly eccentric [[marshmallow]] who always sees everything filled with enthusiasm, and an elderly [[lemon]] named Grandpa Lemon, all of whom were gradually introduced into the show over the years.\n\nMost episodes consist of Orange heckling other characters until they meet a sudden and gruesome end, usually by [[Disembowelment|evisceration]] with a [[chef's knife]] (although the implements used to cut them up range from a [[blender]] to a toy [[pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]). Usually, Orange tries to \"warn\" them before it happens, blurting out the weapon-in-use, such as \"Knife!\".<ref name=\"wsj-orange\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703404004575198410669579950?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech#articleTabs%3Darticle | title= Now Playing on a Computer Near You: A Fruit With an Obnoxious Streak  | first= Geoffrey A. | last= Fowler | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= April 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrange has several recurring mannerisms. He often begins an episode by repeatedly calling for a character's attention until the character responds. Orange also often refers to the character as something that plays on the object's name or appearance (such as calling Grapefruit \"Apefruit\"). If an object behaves in a way Orange dislikes, he will often call that object an \"apple\", even if the object is not (''e.g.'', a tomato). Apart from those, Orange will often tell rude and offensive jokes, burp, fart and make childish noises with his tongue to get attention.\n\nDespite what other fruits and objects think, Orange often cannot control his tendency to be \"[[annoying]]\", and rarely intentionally tries to spite others; he usually means well for most fruits and objects. In one episode of the web series, a \"life coach\", Mango, suggests that Orange uses his annoying nature to try to cope with the destruction of the fruits he tries to make friends with. It is implied that Orange has a learning disability. \n\nRegardless of his seemingly anti-social behavior, Orange can almost always find comfort in the company of his friends and sometimes makes new ones.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*'''Orange''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - the main character who is incredibly annoying. He has the ability to spit seeds from his mouth, and has a passion for farts, TNT, kazoos, making noises, and touching his tongue to his eyeball. Despite this, he is generally good-hearted, to the point of warning his guests about their imminent deaths.\n*'''Pear''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - the only fruit who puts up with Orange (at least most of the time), and is arguably his best friend, although Pear refuses to admit it. The other foods think he is boring due to his passion for reading, and he is often the butt of many jokes throughout the series.\n*'''Midget Apple''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - A diminutive red delicious apple who prefers to be called \"Little Apple\" - as he deems the name \"Midget Apple\" to be politically incorrect towards fruits his size. He owns a monster truck, and is often ridiculed for his height, mostly by Orange. He is also an expert in horror video games, according to the gaming channel.\n*'''Marshmallow''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - Marshmallow is Midget Apple's best friend who talks in a squeaky voice and is almost always in a happy, joyful mood. He loves unicorns (his mother being a unicorn herself), rainbows, cuddly animals, and all things cute. A running gag has many foods & AO fans questioning whether Marshmallow is a boy or a girl - although Marshmallow's gender has referred to be male, according to pronouns used in reference to Marshmallow in his early appearances.\n*'''Grapefruit''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A brawny grapefruit who seems to have a bit of a temper - and is often called \"fat\" by others, usually Orange, much to his frustration. Although he was killed by Knife in his first appearance, he was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" as the head of the titular amalgamated monster, and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In earlier seasons, he acts as an antagonist, but in later seasons, he acts as an antihero and has since become part of the main cast. He has the personality of a bodybuilder, as he likes to flex, and also uses bodybuilding terms a lot. He also likes to impress others, particularly the female foods.\n*'''Passion Fruit''' (voiced by [[Justine Ezarik]]) - Passion Fruit is sweet and sassy, and is Orange's love interest - although Orange constantly refuses to admit he is in love with her out of embarrassment.\n*'''Grandpa Lemon''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - An elderly lemon who constantly falls asleep and has a tendency to mishear words. Like Grapefruit, Grandpa Lemon died in his first appearance, being sliced and juiced into a glass of lemonade, but was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In the High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episode \"Veggie Zombies\", a character called Grandma Lime was mentioned by Grandpa Lemon, which is presumed to be his wife, although it is unconfirmed whether or not she is currently living or deceased, as she was never mentioned again in the franchise.\n\n===Minor===\n*'''Knife''' (voiced by [[Kevin Nalty]], singing voice by Peter Coffin) - A knife who often kills various foods against his will - and not only is he terrified of the fact he is used to mutilate food, but also is terrified of a cruel knife sharpener who seems to find amusement in Knife's suffering.\n*'''Liam the Leprechaun''' (portrayed by Bob Jennings) - A short-tempered leprechaun who's always losing his pot of gold, and ever since his first encounter with Orange, he has become one of his most bitter enemies. He has his own YouTube channel. In early episodes of the series, Orange refers to him as the \"Jolly Green Giant\". \n*'''ZOOM''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - An [[energy drink]]. His recurring one-liner is, \"EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME!\". ZOOM also appears in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZIP''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - Another [[energy drink]] like ZOOM, stated by the latter that ZIP contains more energy per ounce. Like ZOOM, ZIP appears as a power-up in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZOOP''' (voiced by Bob Jennings, and later Aaron Massey) - Yet another [[energy drink]], but also the combination of both ZOOM ''and'' ZIP.\n*'''Squash''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - A nervous butternut squash who always ends up inadvertently falling onto various foods and crushing them to death, much to his horror and disgust, as he doesn't even intend to hurt or kill anyone.\n*'''Copper Lincoln''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A miniature copper statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who is incredibly fond of break-dancing and was birthed from an ordinary penny after it was swallowed and coughed up by a magical oyster.\n*'''Dr. Bananas''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - A brilliant, yet somewhat insane banana scientist - whose inventions have been known to be incredible achievements, or to cause certain death.\n*'''Nude Dude''' (voiced by [[Jack Douglass]], later Kevin Brueck) - An apple who became permanently naked after being put into an electric peeler. It is revealed in \"Barewolf\" that he is a werewolf.\n*'''Captain Obvious''' (voiced by [[Steve Zaragoza]]) - A sea captain onion who always points out the obvious, much to the annoyance of others.\n*'''Lou the Tick''' (voiced by Michael Wingate) - A conspiracy theorist tick who lives in a shelter, always worrying about [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] possibly taking over [[Earth]].\n*'''Orange's Sister''' (voiced by Jess Lizama) - Also referred to as Sissy, Orange's sister is just as annoying as him.\n*'''Gaming Grape''' (voiced by Shannon Jones) - A young grape who loves to play [[video game]]s on his PS4 and other [[game consoles]], much to the chagrin of his mother and his sports fanatic older brother, Game Ball. He mostly appears on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel.\n*'''Sour Rangers''' - These four sour candies that resemble [[Sour Patch Kids]] are parodies of the ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', and have saved the kitchen from the threat of domination or destruction by various villains, including Marshageddon, Lord Bread, and Chivan Stews, via the use of their powers, as well as their Gourds (which are parodies of Zords), which can be used to form Megagourd (parody of the Megazord). So far, they have starred in four episodes chronicling their adventures.\n**'''Red''' (voiced by Steven Zurita) - The team leader, Red seems to be somewhat of a braggart and also seems to be the strongest of the four. His Gourd is a zucchini, and was gifted the power of the Mussel Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Pink''' (voiced by [[Shira Lazar]]) - Pink is a gymnast and the sole female member of the team. Her Gourd is a pumpkin, and was gifted the power of the Oyster Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Yellow''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - Yellow serves as the brains of the team. His Gourd is a squash, and was gifted the power of the Clam Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Green''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - Green is the always-ignored voice of reason, as his logical ideas on how to deal with villains are always shot down by his teammates, even though they would be very effective, much to his chagrin. His Gourd is a courgette, and was gifted the power of an unknown Chowdergourd in the fourth episode (presumed to be a scallop).\n\n==Videos==\n{{Main|List of The Annoying Orange episodes}}\n[[File:Annoying Orange - Orange Coin (Ft iJustine, Steve Zaragoza, and Mikey Bolts).webm|thumb|\"Orange Coin\" episode]]\nThe first Annoying Orange episode was released on October 9, 2009.

The eighth rap was a [[Bendy and the Ink Machine|Bendy]]-themed rap, which was on {{Start date|2017|10|12}}, the ninth rap was Marshmallow rapping instead, which was on {{Start date|2017|11|6}} and the eleventh one was Christmas-themed, which was on {{Start date|2017|12|18}}.\n\n====Annoying Orange Challenges ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|18}}, Orange released a series of challenges from the fans' comments and made a series about it that are very extreme, such as the 3 a.m. challenges. As of {{Start date|2018|2|4}}, there are seven challenges and  a  few  more .\n\n====Shocktober====\nOn every October from 2013 Onwards, horror / Halloween episodes are released to celebrate the month of Halloween. Pear is one of a few characters who happens to hate Shocktober, as first stated in the episode \"The Deviled Egg\". This particular fact was even answered in an Ask Orange question in \"Ask Orange 9\". In later years, Shocktober would also be involved in the Annoying Orange Gaming Channel, in which the characters mostly play Horror Games, games that are scary, or games that are not really scary but are still meant to celebrate Halloween; whether it'd be a videogame, an online web game, a downloadable game, DLC for a game, a fan game, and more.\n\n====Thanksgiving Episodes & Thanksgiving Series====\nThe Annoying Orange has been known to release Thanksgiving Episodes. According to all the foods in the kitchen, Thanksgiving is one of the most dangerous days of the year for foods.\n\n* ThanksGaming (Series)\n* Turducken (Episode; Released on November 7, 2014)\n* Black Friday (5-Part Series; Released from November 23 through 27, 2015; Thanksgiving takes place in Part 4 of the series, which was released on November 26, 2015.)\n* Gobble! Gobble! (Episode; Released on November 18, 2016)\n* PilGRIM Reaper (Episode; Released on November 17, 2017)\n* Thanksgiving Can Stuff It! (Episode; Released on November 16, 2018)\n\n====X-Massacre / Christ-Massacre====\nFrom {{Start date|2017|11|24}} until December 22, 2017, X-Massacre, also called Christ-Massacre, was released. This series is about different types of food being killed and served for a Christmas dinner. Each episode would feature a food from the Christmas Dinner list on the refrigerator. This list is what the foods of the kitchen call the \"X-Massacre List\" / \"Christ-Massacre List\". Whenever a food from the list would be killed, that food gets crossed out from the list.\n\n#Limp Biscuit ({{Start date|2017|11|24}}) (Item Crossed Out: Crescent Rolls)\n#Orange Beans (December 1) (Item Crossed Out: Green Bean Casserole)\n#Nutcracking the Code (December 8) (Items Crossed Out: Chestnuts and Egg Nog)\n#Figgy Pudding (December 15) (Item Crossed Out: Figgy Pudding)\n#Pig Out (December 22) (Items Crossed Out: Ham and Carrots)\n\nThis series had also been reuploaded in the form of a Saturday Supercut on December 30, 2018, 8 days after when the 5th & final episode of the series aired. It basically has all the episodes combined as one, being exactly the same, albeit with a different question of the day at the end of the Supercut.\n\n====Storytime ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|22}}, a new series was released where Pear tries to read classical children's stories and fairy tales, only for Orange to make up his own versions (which the plots are often odd or confusing), much to Pear's chagrin, which started with the second episode on {{Start date|2018|1|5}}. One episode sees Grapefruit reading a story, only for Marshmallow to twist the story up. Marshmallow appeared in a few later episodes as well.\n\nFeatured Stories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=29em|\n#Hansel and Gretel\n#Goldilocks and the Three Bears\n#The Three Little Pigs\n#Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n#Jack and the Beanstalk\n#The Emperor's New Clothes\n#The Little Mermaid\n#The Ugly Duckling\n#Beauty and the Beast\n#The Tortoise and the Hare\n#The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\n#The Boy Who Cried Wolf\n#A Christmas Carol\n#Humpty Dumpty\n#Aladdin\n#Cinderella\n#Rapunzel\n#Little Red Riding Hood\n#Puss in Boots\n#Sleeping Beauty\n#Peter Pan\n#The Snow Queen\n#Rumpelstiltskin\n#Pinocchio\n#The Sword in the Stone}}\n\n====Saturday Supercut ====\nReleasing every Saturday, Orange uploads a collection of a series of older videos, like HOW2 or all of his Wazzup videos, for example.\n\n====Annoying History====\nOn July 31, 2019, a new series of videos called Annoying History was created. Like How2 it is both education and comedy. Pear gives truthful wise information while Orange gives confusing off-topic information that would drive Pear insane.\n\n#[[Moon landing|The Moon Landing]]\n#[[Area 51]]\n#[[Oregon Trail|The Oregon Trail]]\n#[[Black Death|The Black Death]]\n\n==Annoying Orange Gaming channel==\nThe Annoying Orange has his own gaming channel, simply known as Annoying Orange Gaming.

The player is given [[apple]]s and [[banana]]s at the start. When the second level is reached, [[tomato]]es are added.

It stars its creator as an [[anthropomorphic]] orange who annoys fruits, vegetables, and various other objects by using jokes and puns, which are sometimes [[Incivility|crude]].\n\nThe show became popular, later leading to its becoming the subject of a [[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange|TV series]], a [[Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage|video game]], a range of toys, backpacks, couches, pillows, blankets, lunchboxes, drink bottles, mattresses, towels, and a T-shirt line. Other accessories, such as costumes of the series' characters, have also appeared on the market for the company.\n\nSince its inception, the ''Annoying Orange'' [[YouTube]] channel has amassed over 9 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/annoying-orange-creator-takes-collective-ds-to-court/| title=Annoying Orange Creator Takes Collective DS To Court| last=Kiley| first=Rachel| date=December 23, 2014| publisher=NMR| access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show is centered on Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]), who resides on a fruit cart display in a kitchen with other objects such as his best friend, Pear, an irritable but geeky [[Williams pear|Bartlett pear]] (also voiced by Boedigheimer). Other fruits include Passion, a sensible [[passion fruit]] and Orange's love interest played by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]], an arrogant [[grapefruit]] (voiced by Bob Jennings), a tiny but hot-blooded [[Red delicious apple]] known as Midget Apple (though he prefers the name Little Apple), a happy-go-lucky and slightly eccentric [[marshmallow]] who always sees everything filled with enthusiasm, and an elderly [[lemon]] named Grandpa Lemon, all of whom were gradually introduced into the show over the years.\n\nMost episodes consist of Orange heckling other characters until they meet a sudden and gruesome end, usually by [[Disembowelment|evisceration]] with a [[chef's knife]] (although the implements used to cut them up range from a [[blender]] to a toy [[pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]). Usually, Orange tries to \"warn\" them before it happens, blurting out the weapon-in-use, such as \"Knife!\".<ref name=\"wsj-orange\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703404004575198410669579950?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech#articleTabs%3Darticle | title= Now Playing on a Computer Near You: A Fruit With an Obnoxious Streak  | first= Geoffrey A. | last= Fowler | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= April 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrange has several recurring mannerisms. He often begins an episode by repeatedly calling for a character's attention until the character responds. Orange also often refers to the character as something that plays on the object's name or appearance (such as calling Grapefruit \"Apefruit\"). If an object behaves in a way Orange dislikes, he will often call that object an \"apple\", even if the object is not (''e.g.'', a tomato). Apart from those, Orange will often tell rude and offensive jokes, burp, fart and make childish noises with his tongue to get attention.\n\nDespite what other fruits and objects think, Orange often cannot control his tendency to be \"[[annoying]]\", and rarely intentionally tries to spite others; he usually means well for most fruits and objects. In one episode of the web series, a \"life coach\", Mango, suggests that Orange uses his annoying nature to try to cope with the destruction of the fruits he tries to make friends with. It is implied that Orange has a learning disability. \n\nRegardless of his seemingly anti-social behavior, Orange can almost always find comfort in the company of his friends and sometimes makes new ones.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*'''Orange''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - the main character who is incredibly annoying. He has the ability to spit seeds from his mouth, and has a passion for farts, TNT, kazoos, making noises, and touching his tongue to his eyeball. Despite this, he is generally good-hearted, to the point of warning his guests about their imminent deaths.\n*'''Pear''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - the only fruit who puts up with Orange (at least most of the time), and is arguably his best friend, although Pear refuses to admit it. The other foods think he is boring due to his passion for reading, and he is often the butt of many jokes throughout the series.\n*'''Midget Apple''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - A diminutive red delicious apple who prefers to be called \"Little Apple\" - as he deems the name \"Midget Apple\" to be politically incorrect towards fruits his size. He owns a monster truck, and is often ridiculed for his height, mostly by Orange. He is also an expert in horror video games, according to the gaming channel.\n*'''Marshmallow''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - Marshmallow is Midget Apple's best friend who talks in a squeaky voice and is almost always in a happy, joyful mood. He loves unicorns (his mother being a unicorn herself), rainbows, cuddly animals, and all things cute. A running gag has many foods & AO fans questioning whether Marshmallow is a boy or a girl - although Marshmallow's gender has referred to be male, according to pronouns used in reference to Marshmallow in his early appearances.\n*'''Grapefruit''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A brawny grapefruit who seems to have a bit of a temper - and is often called \"fat\" by others, usually Orange, much to his frustration. Although he was killed by Knife in his first appearance, he was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" as the head of the titular amalgamated monster, and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In earlier seasons, he acts as an antagonist, but in later seasons, he acts as an antihero and has since become part of the main cast. He has the personality of a bodybuilder, as he likes to flex, and also uses bodybuilding terms a lot. He also likes to impress others, particularly the female foods.\n*'''Passion Fruit''' (voiced by [[Justine Ezarik]]) - Passion Fruit is sweet and sassy, and is Orange's love interest - although Orange constantly refuses to admit he is in love with her out of embarrassment.\n*'''Grandpa Lemon''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - An elderly lemon who constantly falls asleep and has a tendency to mishear words. Like Grapefruit, Grandpa Lemon died in his first appearance, being sliced and juiced into a glass of lemonade, but was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In the High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episode \"Veggie Zombies\", a character called Grandma Lime was mentioned by Grandpa Lemon, which is presumed to be his wife, although it is unconfirmed whether or not she is currently living or deceased, as she was never mentioned again in the franchise.\n\n===Minor===\n*'''Knife''' (voiced by [[Kevin Nalty]], singing voice by Peter Coffin) - A knife who often kills various foods against his will - and not only is he terrified of the fact he is used to mutilate food, but also is terrified of a cruel knife sharpener who seems to find amusement in Knife's suffering.\n*'''Liam the Leprechaun''' (portrayed by Bob Jennings) - A short-tempered leprechaun who's always losing his pot of gold, and ever since his first encounter with Orange, he has become one of his most bitter enemies. He has his own YouTube channel. In early episodes of the series, Orange refers to him as the \"Jolly Green Giant\". \n*'''ZOOM''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - An [[energy drink]]. His recurring one-liner is, \"EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME!\". ZOOM also appears in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZIP''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - Another [[energy drink]] like ZOOM, stated by the latter that ZIP contains more energy per ounce. Like ZOOM, ZIP appears as a power-up in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZOOP''' (voiced by Bob Jennings, and later Aaron Massey) - Yet another [[energy drink]], but also the combination of both ZOOM ''and'' ZIP.\n*'''Squash''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - A nervous butternut squash who always ends up inadvertently falling onto various foods and crushing them to death, much to his horror and disgust, as he doesn't even intend to hurt or kill anyone.\n*'''Copper Lincoln''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A miniature copper statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who is incredibly fond of break-dancing and was birthed from an ordinary penny after it was swallowed and coughed up by a magical oyster.\n*'''Dr. Bananas''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - A brilliant, yet somewhat insane banana scientist - whose inventions have been known to be incredible achievements, or to cause certain death.\n*'''Nude Dude''' (voiced by [[Jack Douglass]], later Kevin Brueck) - An apple who became permanently naked after being put into an electric peeler. It is revealed in \"Barewolf\" that he is a werewolf.\n*'''Captain Obvious''' (voiced by [[Steve Zaragoza]]) - A sea captain onion who always points out the obvious, much to the annoyance of others.\n*'''Lou the Tick''' (voiced by Michael Wingate) - A conspiracy theorist tick who lives in a shelter, always worrying about [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] possibly taking over [[Earth]].\n*'''Orange's Sister''' (voiced by Jess Lizama) - Also referred to as Sissy, Orange's sister is just as annoying as him.\n*'''Gaming Grape''' (voiced by Shannon Jones) - A young grape who loves to play [[video game]]s on his PS4 and other [[game consoles]], much to the chagrin of his mother and his sports fanatic older brother, Game Ball. He mostly appears on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel.\n*'''Sour Rangers''' - These four sour candies that resemble [[Sour Patch Kids]] are parodies of the ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', and have saved the kitchen from the threat of domination or destruction by various villains, including Marshageddon, Lord Bread, and Chivan Stews, via the use of their powers, as well as their Gourds (which are parodies of Zords), which can be used to form Megagourd (parody of the Megazord). So far, they have starred in four episodes chronicling their adventures.\n**'''Red''' (voiced by Steven Zurita) - The team leader, Red seems to be somewhat of a braggart and also seems to be the strongest of the four. His Gourd is a zucchini, and was gifted the power of the Mussel Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Pink''' (voiced by [[Shira Lazar]]) - Pink is a gymnast and the sole female member of the team. Her Gourd is a pumpkin, and was gifted the power of the Oyster Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Yellow''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - Yellow serves as the brains of the team. His Gourd is a squash, and was gifted the power of the Clam Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Green''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - Green is the always-ignored voice of reason, as his logical ideas on how to deal with villains are always shot down by his teammates, even though they would be very effective, much to his chagrin. His Gourd is a courgette, and was gifted the power of an unknown Chowdergourd in the fourth episode (presumed to be a scallop).\n\n==Videos==\n{{Main|List of The Annoying Orange episodes}}\n[[File:Annoying Orange - Orange Coin (Ft iJustine, Steve Zaragoza, and Mikey Bolts).webm|thumb|\"Orange Coin\" episode]]\nThe first Annoying Orange episode was released on October 9, 2009.

While Pear gives useful and proper advice, Orange gives advice that is misleading, confusing, or off-topic. It was released on {{Start date|2016|1|27}} with How To Tie a Tie, and despite that Orange ends much of the videos by surviving an explosion of TNT - in How to Make a Halloween Costume on {{Start date|2017|10|11}}, Pear ended the video with TNT due to Orange going overboard with terms of cows, which has become a running gag since How to be a Rapper on {{Start date|2017|8|2}}. There were 3 Christmas/New Year specials in 2016, 4 in 2017, 1 in 2018 and 12 Halloween/Shocktober-themed episodes, four in 2016, 2017, & 2018 each. As of {{Start date|2019|7|24}}, there have been ??? HOW2 episodes.\n\n====Emoji Raps====\nThe Emoji Raps star Orange rapping about several things using emojis, including himself.

The eighth rap was a [[Bendy and the Ink Machine|Bendy]]-themed rap, which was on {{Start date|2017|10|12}}, the ninth rap was Marshmallow rapping instead, which was on {{Start date|2017|11|6}} and the eleventh one was Christmas-themed, which was on {{Start date|2017|12|18}}.\n\n====Annoying Orange Challenges ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|18}}, Orange released a series of challenges from the fans' comments and made a series about it that are very extreme, such as the 3 a.m. challenges. As of {{Start date|2018|2|4}}, there are seven challenges and  a  few  more .\n\n====Shocktober====\nOn every October from 2013 Onwards, horror / Halloween episodes are released to celebrate the month of Halloween. Pear is one of a few characters who happens to hate Shocktober, as first stated in the episode \"The Deviled Egg\". This particular fact was even answered in an Ask Orange question in \"Ask Orange 9\". In later years, Shocktober would also be involved in the Annoying Orange Gaming Channel, in which the characters mostly play Horror Games, games that are scary, or games that are not really scary but are still meant to celebrate Halloween; whether it'd be a videogame, an online web game, a downloadable game, DLC for a game, a fan game, and more.\n\n====Thanksgiving Episodes & Thanksgiving Series====\nThe Annoying Orange has been known to release Thanksgiving Episodes. According to all the foods in the kitchen, Thanksgiving is one of the most dangerous days of the year for foods.\n\n* ThanksGaming (Series)\n* Turducken (Episode; Released on November 7, 2014)\n* Black Friday (5-Part Series; Released from November 23 through 27, 2015; Thanksgiving takes place in Part 4 of the series, which was released on November 26, 2015.)\n* Gobble!

This series is about different types of food being killed and served for a Christmas dinner. Each episode would feature a food from the Christmas Dinner list on the refrigerator. This list is what the foods of the kitchen call the \"X-Massacre List\" / \"Christ-Massacre List\". Whenever a food from the list would be killed, that food gets crossed out from the list.\n\n#Limp Biscuit ({{Start date|2017|11|24}}) (Item Crossed Out: Crescent Rolls)\n#Orange Beans (December 1) (Item Crossed Out: Green Bean Casserole)\n#Nutcracking the Code (December 8) (Items Crossed Out: Chestnuts and Egg Nog)\n#Figgy Pudding (December 15) (Item Crossed Out: Figgy Pudding)\n#Pig Out (December 22) (Items Crossed Out: Ham and Carrots)\n\nThis series had also been reuploaded in the form of a Saturday Supercut on December 30, 2018, 8 days after when the 5th & final episode of the series aired. It basically has all the episodes combined as one, being exactly the same, albeit with a different question of the day at the end of the Supercut.\n\n====Storytime ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|22}}, a new series was released where Pear tries to read classical children's stories and fairy tales, only for Orange to make up his own versions (which the plots are often odd or confusing), much to Pear's chagrin, which started with the second episode on {{Start date|2018|1|5}}. One episode sees Grapefruit reading a story, only for Marshmallow to twist the story up. Marshmallow appeared in a few later episodes as well.\n\nFeatured Stories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=29em|\n#Hansel and Gretel\n#Goldilocks and the Three Bears\n#The Three Little Pigs\n#Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n#Jack and the Beanstalk\n#The Emperor's New Clothes\n#The Little Mermaid\n#The Ugly Duckling\n#Beauty and the Beast\n#The Tortoise and the Hare\n#The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\n#The Boy Who Cried Wolf\n#A Christmas Carol\n#Humpty Dumpty\n#Aladdin\n#Cinderella\n#Rapunzel\n#Little Red Riding Hood\n#Puss in Boots\n#Sleeping Beauty\n#Peter Pan\n#The Snow Queen\n#Rumpelstiltskin\n#Pinocchio\n#The Sword in the Stone}}\n\n====Saturday Supercut ====\nReleasing every Saturday, Orange uploads a collection of a series of older videos, like HOW2 or all of his Wazzup videos, for example.\n\n====Annoying History====\nOn July 31, 2019, a new series of videos called Annoying History was created. Like How2 it is both education and comedy. Pear gives truthful wise information while Orange gives confusing off-topic information that would drive Pear insane.\n\n#[[Moon landing|The Moon Landing]]\n#[[Area 51]]\n#[[Oregon Trail|The Oregon Trail]]\n#[[Black Death|The Black Death]]\n\n==Annoying Orange Gaming channel==\nThe Annoying Orange has his own gaming channel, simply known as Annoying Orange Gaming.

The studio kept him on for ''[[Lili]]'' (1953) as the title character (played by [[Leslie Caron]])'s love interest. It was another big success; Ferrer and Caron also got a hit single out of it, \"Hi-Lili-Hi-Lo\". ''[[Saadia (film)|Saadia]]'' (1953), which Ferrer made with [[Cornel Wilde]], was a flop, but ''[[Knights of the Round Table (film)|Knights of the Round Table]]'' (1954), in which Ferrer played King Arthur, was another hit.

Ferrer returned to MGM to make ''[[The Vintage]]'' (1957) with [[Pier Angeli]], which was a big flop.

Upon hearing this news, Sambhaji started his preparations and took possession of the Panhala fort. He arrested the fort commander Vitthal Tryambak and senior minister Janardanpant Hanumante who were involved in the conspiracy. He also asked his father-in-law of Pilajirao Shirke to be ready with his forces at Shringarpur. Both sides were vying for the crucial support of [[Hambirrao Mohite]] the commander-in-chief of Maratha army. He was the brother of [[Soyarabai]] and the maternal uncle of [[Rajaram I|Rajaram]]<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> . Soyarabai issued orders to [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] and [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle|Moropant]] to leave Raigad with a force of 5,000 to arrest Sambhaji at Panhala. Hambirrao was near [[Karad]] with his army of 20,000. Anaji and Moropant came to meet Hambirrao and asked for his support to arrest Sambhaji. Hambirrao refused and arrested both these ministers. On the next day Hambirrao along with his senior generals Rupaji Bhosle and Anandrao Makaji met Sambhaji at Panhala.

Sambhaji held a ceremony at Panhala to acknowledge Hambirrao's support. He stayed at Panhala for some time as condolence letters were coming to him from British, Portuguese, Dutch, French, Adilshahi, Qutbshahi and other neighbouring powers after Shivaji's death. Meanwhile he asked Pilajirao to secure Raigad with a force of 10,000. He was confronted by sardar Malsawant of Soyarabai's side but Pilajirao defeated and arrested him and secured the control of Raigad [[Raigad Fort|fort]]. Sambhaji formally ascended the throne on 20 July 1680. Rajaram, his mother [[Soyarabai]], all the senior ministers involved in the conspiracy were put under house arrest. Malsawant still kept on insulting Sambhaji and he was executed by throwing him off the cliff.(Takmak Tok cliff). Sambhaji's coronation took place on 16 January 1681. Sambhaji pardoned and restored all the ministers such as [[Janardanpant]], [[Hiroji Farzand]], Rahuji Somnath in their previously held positions. Peshwa Moropant had died meanwhile, his position was given to his son Nilopant Pingale. [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] was also pardoned but he was transferred to Mujumdar and his former post of Suranvis was given to [[Abaji Sondev]] <ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />. In 1681 Aurangzeb's rebel son Akbar along with Rajput chieftain Durgadas Rathore had arrived in Maharashtra to seek help against his father. Sambhaji had appointed Hiroji Farzand to negotiate with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore. The conspirators tried lure Akbar to their side to dethrone Sambhaji. They offered him half of the Maratha kingdom in return for his support to dethrone Sambhaji. The conspirators also tried to poison Sambhaji but the attempt failed. Akbar did not pay heed to their offer and instead informed Sambhaji about this conspiracy. Sambhaji quickly marched to [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]] and arrested the conspirators near Sudhagad fort at Pali. Senior ministers Anaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand, Balaji Awji, Somaji Datto, Awji Balaji and others were arrested. Sambhaji had pardoned them before and they still conspired to poison him. Sambhaji gave the order to execute the traitors by trampling them under elephant. Some of Shivaji's ministers such as Annaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand and other conspirators were executed on charges of conspiracy and treason.<ref name=\"Mehta2005\"/>{{rp|48}}<ref name=\"SharmaL\u0101\u02bcibrer\u012b2004\">{{cite book|author1=Sunita Sharma|author2=K\u0332h\u0332ud\u0101 Bak\u0332h\u0332sh Oriyan\u1e6dal Pablik L\u0101\u02bcibrer\u012b|title=Veil, sceptre, and quill: profiles of eminent women, 16th- 18th centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2kaAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=30 September 2012|year=2004|publisher=Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library|page=139}} \u2013 ''By June 1680 three months after Shivaji's death Rajaram was made a prisoner in the fort of [[Raigad Fort|Raigad]].\"</ref> Sambhaji arrived at Raigad and put Soyarabai and Rajaram under house arrest. Soyarabai was guilty for her actions and commited suicide by poisoning herself. Sambhaji was very sad at the demise of Soyarabai which is evident from the letter sent by him to Bakre Shastri of Kudal wherein he mentions that 'Soyarabai had a pure heart'.

Historians have been quick to note the distinction between the more tolerant and chivalrous practices of his father Shivaji, and the more pragmatic and brutal practices of Sambhaji. \n\n===Attack on Burhanpur===\nThe fort of Burhanpur was first in the charge of Bahadur khan who later gave it to Kakar Khan. Kakar was at the duty of collecting [[Jizya]] tax from the citizens. In order to accomplish the task, Kakar Khan destroyed more than 100 temples surrounding Burhanpur and conducting torture, plunder, killing, cutting of women's ears and men's eyes for the wealth. The Jizya was collected and stored captive at the Burhanpur fort.<ref>{|url=  http://informatonaboutsambhajiraje.blogspot.com/2016/10/maratha-yodhha-early-life-sambhaji-was.html?m=1}</ref>.Sambhaji plundered and ravaged [[Burhanpur]] in 1680.

They were allowed into the fort and planned to detonate the [[gunpowder magazine]] during a coming Maratha attack. However, one of the female defectors became involved with a Siddi man and he uncovered the plot, and the infiltrators were executed. The Maratha then attempted to build a stone [[causeway]] from the shore to the island, but were interrupted halfway through when the Mughal army moved to menace Raigad.

[[Keshav Pandit]] was employed for Sambhaji's education. Keshav Pandit, alias Keshav Bhatta of Shringarpur, was an erudite scholar in the Nitishastra and Sanskrit language and literature. He seems to have deeper knowledge of the different forms of Sanskrit literature; Hindu jurisprudence and the Puranas. He also seems to have made Sambhaji familiar with the famous works of different sciences and music written by ancient scholars in the Sanskrit language.<ref name=\"Joshi1980\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ngBAAAAMAAJ&q=Keshav+Pandit+Sambhaji&dq=Keshav+Pandit+Sambhaji&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4nJWctqfaAhXMPo8KHa3gDC8Q6AEIJzAA|title=Chhatrapati Sambhaji, 1657\u20131689 A.D.|last=Joshi|first=Pandit Shankar|date=1980|publisher=S.

Sambhaji's rule was largely shaped by the ongoing wars between the Maratha kingdom and [[Mughal Empire]] as well as other neighbouring powers such as the [[Siddi]]s, [[Mysore]] and the Portuguese in [[Goa]]. In 1689, Sambhaji was captured, tortured and executed by the Mughals, and succeeded by his brother [[Rajaram I]].<ref name=\"sen2\">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=199\u2013200}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nSambhaji was born at [[Purandar fort]] to [[Sai Bhosale|Saibai]], Shivaji's first wife.

Upon hearing this news, Sambhaji started his preparations and took possession of the Panhala fort. He arrested the fort commander Vitthal Tryambak and senior minister Janardanpant Hanumante who were involved in the conspiracy. He also asked his father-in-law of Pilajirao Shirke to be ready with his forces at Shringarpur. Both sides were vying for the crucial support of [[Hambirrao Mohite]] the commander-in-chief of Maratha army. He was the brother of [[Soyarabai]] and the maternal uncle of [[Rajaram I|Rajaram]]<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> . Soyarabai issued orders to [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] and [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle|Moropant]] to leave Raigad with a force of 5,000 to arrest Sambhaji at Panhala. Hambirrao was near [[Karad]] with his army of 20,000. Anaji and Moropant came to meet Hambirrao and asked for his support to arrest Sambhaji. Hambirrao refused and arrested both these ministers. On the next day Hambirrao along with his senior generals Rupaji Bhosle and Anandrao Makaji met Sambhaji at Panhala. Sambhaji was delighted at the arrival of Hambirrao on his side<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Patil|first=Vishwas|title=Sambhaji|publisher=Mehta Publishing House|year=2016|isbn=9788177666519|location=Pune|pages=196-208}}</ref> . Sambhaji held a ceremony at Panhala to acknowledge Hambirrao's support. He stayed at Panhala for some time as condolence letters were coming to him from British, Portuguese, Dutch, French, Adilshahi, Qutbshahi and other neighbouring powers after Shivaji's death. Meanwhile he asked Pilajirao to secure Raigad with a force of 10,000. He was confronted by sardar Malsawant of Soyarabai's side but Pilajirao defeated and arrested him and secured the control of Raigad [[Raigad Fort|fort]]. Sambhaji formally ascended the throne on 20 July 1680. Rajaram, his mother [[Soyarabai]], all the senior ministers involved in the conspiracy were put under house arrest. Malsawant still kept on insulting Sambhaji and he was executed by throwing him off the cliff.(Takmak Tok cliff). Sambhaji's coronation took place of 16th January 1681. Sambhaji pardoned and restored all the ministers such as [[Janardanpant]], [[Hiroji Farzand]], Rahuji Somnath in their previously held positions. Peshwa Moropant had died meanwhile, his position was given to his son Nilopant Pingale. [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] was also pardoned but he was transferred to Mujumdar and his former post of Suranvis was given to [[Abaji Sondev]] <ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />. In 1681 Aurangzeb's rebel son Akbar along with Rajput chieftain Durgadas Rathore had arrived in Maharashtra to seek help against his father. Sambhaji had appointed Hiroji Farzand to negotiate with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore. The conspirators tried lure Akbar to their side to dethrone Sambhaji. They offered him half of the Maratha kingdom in return for his support to dethrone Sambhaji. The conspirators also tried to poison Sambhaji but the attempt failed. Akbar did not pay heed to their offer and instead informed Sambhaji about this conspiracy. Sambhaji quickly marched to [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]] and arrested the conspirators near Sudhagad fort at Pali. Senior ministers Anaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand, Balaji Awji, Somaji Datto, Awji Balaji and others were arrested. Sambhaji had pardoned them before and they still conspired to poison him. Sambhaji gave the order to execute the traitors by trampling them under elephant. Some of Shivaji's ministers such as Annaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand and other conspirators were executed on charges of conspiracy and treason.<ref name=\"Mehta2005\"/>{{rp|48}}<ref name=\"SharmaL\u0101\u02bcibrer\u012b2004\">{{cite book|author1=Sunita Sharma|author2=K\u0332h\u0332ud\u0101 Bak\u0332h\u0332sh Oriyan\u1e6dal Pablik L\u0101\u02bcibrer\u012b|title=Veil, sceptre, and quill: profiles of eminent women, 16th- 18th centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2kaAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=30 September 2012|year=2004|publisher=Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library|page=139}} \u2013 ''By June 1680 three months after Shivaji's death Rajaram was made a prisoner in the fort of [[Raigad Fort|Raigad]].\"</ref> Sambhaji arrived at Raigad and put Soyarabai and Rajaram under house arrest.

Kakar was at the duty of collecting [[Jizya]] tax from the citizens.

They were allowed into the fort and planned to detonate the [[gunpowder magazine]] during a coming Maratha attack. However, one of the female defectors became involved with a Siddi man and he uncovered the plot, and the infiltrators were executed. The Maratha then attempted to build a stone [[causeway]] from the shore to the island, but were interrupted halfway through when the Mughal army moved to menace Raigad.

{"title_page": "Consistent hashing", "text_new": "In [[computer science]], '''consistent hashing''' is a special kind of [[hash function|hashing]] such that when a [[hash table]] is resized, only <math>n/m</math> keys need to be remapped on average where <math>n</math> is the number of keys and <math>m</math> is the number of slots.\n\nIn contrast, in most traditional hash tables, a change in the number of array slots causes nearly all keys to be remapped because the mapping between the keys and the slots is defined by a [[Modular arithmetic|modular operation]]. Consistent hashing is a particular case of [[rendezvous hashing]], which has a conceptually simpler algorithm, and was first described in 1996. Consistent hashing first appeared in 1997, and uses a different algorithm.<ref name=\"KargerEtAl1997\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe term \"consistent hashing\" was introduced by [[David Karger|Karger]] ''et al.'' at [[MIT]] for use in distributed caching. This academic paper from 1997 introduced the term \"consistent hashing\" as a way of distributing requests among a changing population of web servers. Each slot is then represented by a node in a distributed system. The addition (joins) and removal (leaves/failures) of nodes only requires <math>num\\_keys/num\\_slots</math> items to be re-shuffled when the number of slots/nodes change. The authors mention [[linear hashing]] and its ability to handle sequential node addition and removal, while consistent hashing allows buckets to be added and removed in arbitrary order.\n<ref name=\"KargerEtAl1997\">{{cite conference\n | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=258660\n | doi = 10.1145/258533.258660\n |author1= Karger, D. |author2=Lehman, E. |author3=[[F.

Teradata still use the concept of a [[hash table]] to fulfill exactly this purpose. [[Akamai Technologies]] was founded in 1998 by the scientists [[Daniel Lewin]] and [[F. Thomson Leighton]] (co-authors of the article coining \"consistent hashing\") to apply this algorithm, which gave birth to the [[content delivery network]] industry.\n\nConsistent hashing has also been used to reduce the impact of partial system failures in large web applications to provide robust caching without incurring the system-wide fallout of a failure.<ref name=KargerEtAl1999>{{cite journal |url=http://www8.org/w8-papers/2a-webserver/caching/paper2.html |doi=10.1016/S1389-1286(99)00055-9 |author1=Karger, D. |author2=Sherman, A. |author3=Berkheimer, A. |author4=Bogstad, B. |author5=Dhanidina, R. |author6=Iwamoto, K. |author7=Kim, B. |author8=Matkins, L. |author9=Yerushalmi, Y. |journal=Computer Networks |volume=31 |issue=11 |pages=1203\u20131213 |year=1999 |title=Web Caching with Consistent Hashing |access-date=2008-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721013638/http://www8.org/w8-papers/2a-webserver/caching/paper2.html |archive-date=2008-07-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nConsistent hashing is also the cornerstone of [[distributed hash table]]s (DHTs), which employ hash values to partition a keyspace across a distributed set of nodes, then construct an overlay network of connected nodes that provide efficient node retrieval by key.\n\n[[Rendezvous hashing]], designed at the same time as consistent hashing, achieves the same goals using the very different highest random weight (HRW) algorithm. \n<!-- should describe here why the \"consistency\" of consistent hashing is essential to DHTs -->\n\n==Motivations==\n\nWhile running collections of caching machines some limitations are experienced. A common way of [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] <math>n</math> cache machines is to put object <math>o</math> in cache machine number <math>\\text{hash}(o)\\; \\left(\\text{mod } n\\right)</math>. But this will not work if a cache machine is added or removed because <math>n</math> changes and every object is hashed to a new location. This can be disastrous since the originating content servers are flooded with requests from the cache machines. Hence consistent hashing is needed to avoid swamping of servers.\n\nConsistent hashing maps objects to the same cache machine, as far as possible. It means when a cache machine is added, it takes its share of objects from all the other cache machines and when it is removed, its objects are shared among the remaining machines.\n\nThe main idea behind the consistent hashing algorithm is to associate each cache with one or more hash value intervals where the interval boundaries are determined by calculating the hash of each cache identifier. (The hash function used to define the intervals does not have to be the same function used to hash the cached values. Only the range of the two functions need match.) If the cache is removed, its interval is taken over by a cache with an adjacent interval while all the remaining caches are unchanged.\n\n==Technique==\n\nConsistent hashing is based on mapping each object to a point on a circle (or equivalently, mapping each object to a real angle). The system maps each available machine (or other storage bucket) to many pseudo-randomly distributed points on the same circle.\n\nTo find where an object should be placed, the system finds the location of that object's key on the circle; then walks around the circle until falling into the first bucket it encounters (or equivalently, the first available bucket with a higher angle). The result is that each bucket contains all the resources located between each one of its points and the previous points that belong to other buckets.\n\nIf a bucket becomes unavailable (for example because the computer it resides on is not reachable), then the points it maps to will be removed. Requests for resources that would have mapped to each of those points now map to the next highest points. Since each bucket is associated with many pseudo-randomly distributed points, the resources that were held by that bucket will now map to many different buckets. The items that mapped to the lost bucket must be redistributed among the remaining ones, but values mapping to other buckets will still do so and do not need to be moved.\n\nA similar process occurs when a bucket is added. By adding new bucket points, we make any resources between those and the points corresponding to the next smaller angles map to the new bucket. These resources will no longer be associated with the previous buckets, and any value previously stored there will not be found by the selection method described above.\n\nThe portion of the keys associated with each bucket can be altered by altering the number of angles that bucket maps to.\n\n=== Monotonic keys ===\nIf key values will always increase [[monotonic]]ally, an alternative

[[hash function|hashing]] such that when a [[hash table]] is resized, only <math>n/m</math> keys need to be remapped on average where <math>n</math> is the number of keys and <math>m</math> is the number of slots.\n\nIn contrast, in most traditional hash tables, a change in the number of array slots causes nearly all keys to be remapped because the mapping between the keys and the slots is defined by a [[Modular arithmetic|modular operation]]. Consistent hashing is a particular case of [[rendezvous hashing]], which has a conceptually simpler algorithm, and was first described in 1996.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}. Consistent hashing first appeared in 1997, and uses a different algorithm.<ref name=\"KargerEtAl1997\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe term \"consistent hashing\" was introduced by [[David Karger|Karger]] ''et al.'' at [[MIT]] for use in distributed caching. This academic paper from 1997 introduced the term \"consistent hashing\" as a way of distributing requests among a changing population of web servers. Each slot is then represented by a node in a distributed system. The addition (joins) and removal (leaves/failures) of nodes only requires <math>num\\_keys/num\\_slots</math> items to be re-shuffled when the number of slots/nodes change. The authors mention [[linear hashing]] and its ability to handle sequential node addition and removal, while consistent hashing allows buckets to be added and removed in arbitrary order.\n<ref name=\"KargerEtAl1997\">{{cite conference\n | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=258660\n | doi = 10.1145/258533.258660\n |author1= Karger, D. |author2=Lehman, E. |author3=[[F.

Teradata still use the concept of a [[hash table]] to fulfill exactly this purpose. [[Akamai Technologies]] was founded in 1998 by the scientists [[Daniel Lewin]] and [[F. Thomson Leighton]] (co-authors of the article coining \"consistent hashing\") to apply this algorithm, which gave birth to the [[content delivery network]] industry.\n\nConsistent hashing has also been used to reduce the impact of partial system failures in large web applications to provide robust caching without incurring the system-wide fallout of a failure.<ref name=KargerEtAl1999>{{cite journal |url=http://www8.org/w8-papers/2a-webserver/caching/paper2.html |doi=10.1016/S1389-1286(99)00055-9 |author1=Karger, D. |author2=Sherman, A. |author3=Berkheimer, A. |author4=Bogstad, B. |author5=Dhanidina, R. |author6=Iwamoto, K. |author7=Kim, B. |author8=Matkins, L. |author9=Yerushalmi, Y. |journal=Computer Networks |volume=31 |issue=11 |pages=1203\u20131213 |year=1999 |title=Web Caching with Consistent Hashing |access-date=2008-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721013638/http://www8.org/w8-papers/2a-webserver/caching/paper2.html |archive-date=2008-07-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nConsistent hashing is also the cornerstone of [[distributed hash table]]s (DHTs), which employ hash values to partition a keyspace across a distributed set of nodes, then construct an overlay network of connected nodes that provide efficient node retrieval by key.\n\n[[Rendezvous hashing]], designed at the same time as consistent hashing, achieves the same goals using the very different highest random weight (HRW) algorithm. \n<!-- should describe here why the \"consistency\" of consistent hashing is essential to DHTs -->\n\n==Motivations==\n\nWhile running collections of caching machines some limitations are experienced. A common way of [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] <math>n</math> cache machines is to put object <math>o</math> in cache machine number <math>\\text{hash}(o)\\; \\left(\\text{mod } n\\right)</math>. But this will not work if a cache machine is added or removed because <math>n</math> changes and every object is hashed to a new location. This can be disastrous since the originating content servers are flooded with requests from the cache machines. Hence consistent hashing is needed to avoid swamping of servers.\n\nConsistent hashing maps objects to the same cache machine, as far as possible. It means when a cache machine is added, it takes its share of objects from all the other cache machines and when it is removed, its objects are shared among the remaining machines.\n\nThe main idea behind the consistent hashing algorithm is to associate each cache with one or more hash value intervals where the interval boundaries are determined by calculating the hash of each cache identifier. (The hash function used to define the intervals does not have to be the same function used to hash the cached values. Only the range of the two functions need match.) If the cache is removed, its interval is taken over by a cache with an adjacent interval while all the remaining caches are unchanged.\n\n==Technique==\n\nConsistent hashing is based on mapping each object to a point on a circle (or equivalently, mapping each object to a real angle). The system maps each available machine (or other storage bucket) to many pseudo-randomly distributed points on the same circle.\n\nTo find where an object should be placed, the system finds the location of that object's key on the circle; then walks around the circle until falling into the first bucket it encounters (or equivalently, the first available bucket with a higher angle). The result is that each bucket contains all the resources located between each one of its points and the previous points that belong to other buckets.\n\nIf a bucket becomes unavailable (for example because the computer it resides on is not reachable), then the points it maps to will be removed. Requests for resources that would have mapped to each of those points now map to the next highest points. Since each bucket is associated with many pseudo-randomly distributed points, the resources that were held by that bucket will now map to many different buckets. The items that mapped to the lost bucket must be redistributed among the remaining ones, but values mapping to other buckets will still do so and do not need to be moved.\n\nA similar process occurs when a bucket is added. By adding new bucket points, we make any resources between those and the points corresponding to the next smaller angles map to the new bucket. These resources will no longer be associated with the previous buckets, and any value previously stored there will not be found by the selection method described above.\n\nThe portion of the keys associated with each bucket can be altered by altering the number of angles that bucket maps to.\n\n=== Monotonic keys ===\nIf key values will always increase [[monotonic]]ally, an alternative approach using a [[Hash table#Monotonic keys|hash table with monotonic keys]] may be more suitable.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Complexity ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Asymptotic

It is based on the children's book of same name by [[Lois Lowry]]. \n\nThe film stars the voices of [[Will Forte]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Alessia Cara]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Martin Short]], [[Jane Krakowski]] and [[Ricky Gervais]].

{"title_page": "Traction motor", "text_new": "{{see also|Electric vehicle|Electric motor}}\n\nA '''traction motor''' is an [[electric motor]] used for propulsion of a vehicle, such as [[locomotive]]s, [[electric vehicle|electric]] or [[hydrogen vehicle]]s, [[elevator]]s or [[electric multiple unit]].\n\nTraction motors are used in electrically powered rail vehicles ([[electric multiple unit]]s) and  other [[electric vehicle]]s including [[electric milk float]]s, [[elevator]]s, [[roller coaster]]s, [[conveyor]]s, and [[trolleybus]]es, as well as vehicles with electrical transmission systems ([[Diesel locomotive#Transmission types|Diesel-electric Locomotive]]s, electric [[hybrid vehicle]]s), and [[battery electric vehicle]]s.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Motor types and control==\n[[DC motor|Direct-current motors]] with series [[Field coil|field windings]] are the oldest type of traction motors. These provide a speed-torque characteristic useful for propulsion, providing high torque at lower speeds for acceleration of the vehicle, and declining torque as speed increases. By arranging the field winding with multiple taps, the speed characteristic can be varied, allowing relatively smooth operator control of acceleration. A further measure of control is provided by using pairs of motors on a vehicle in [[series-parallel control]]; for slow operation or heavy loads, two motors can be run in series off the direct-current supply. Where higher speed is desired, these motors can be operated in parallel, making a higher voltage available at each and so allowing higher speeds. Parts of a rail system might use different voltages, with higher voltages in long runs between stations and lower voltage near stations where only slower operation is needed.\n\nA variant of the DC system is the AC-operated series motor, which is essentially the same device but operated on alternating current. Since both the armature and field current reverse at the same time, the behavior of the motor is similar to that when energized with direct current. To achieve better operating conditions, AC railways are often supplied with current at a lower  [[utility frequency|frequency]] than the commercial supply used for general lighting and power; special [[traction current]] power stations are used, or [[rotary converter]]s used to convert 50 or 60&nbsp;Hz commercial power to the 25&nbsp;Hz or {{frac|16|2|3}}&nbsp;Hz frequency used for AC traction motors. The AC system allows efficient distribution of power down the length of a rail line, and also permits speed control with switchgear on the vehicle.\n\nAC induction motors and synchronous motors are simple and low maintenance, but are awkward to apply for traction motors because of their fixed speed characteristic. An AC induction motor only generates useful amounts of power over a narrow speed range determined by its construction and the frequency of the AC power supply. The advent of [[power semiconductor device|power semiconductors]] has made it possible to fit a [[variable frequency drive]] on a locomotive; this allows a wide range of speeds, AC power transmission, and rugged induction motors without wearing parts like brushes and commutators.<ref name=AS08>Andreas Steimel ''Electric Traction - Motive Power and Energy Supply: Basics and Practical Experience '' Oldenbourg Industrieverlag, 2008 {{ISBN|3835631322}} ; Chapter 6 \"Induction Traction Motors and Their Control\"</ref>\n\n==Transportation applications==\n\n===Road vehicles===\n{{see also|Hybrid electric vehicle|battery electric vehicle}}\nTraditionally road vehicles (cars, buses and trucks) have used diesel and petrol engines with a mechanical or hydraulic transmission system. In the latter part of the 20th century, vehicles with electrical transmission systems (powered from [[internal combustion engine]]s, batteries or [[fuel cells]]) began to be developed\u2014one advantage of using electric machines is that specific types can regenerate energy (i.e. act as a [[regenerative brake]])\u2014providing deceleration as well as increasing overall efficiency by charging the battery pack.\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:Ge 6-6 I 407 Krokodil.jpeg|thumb|Swiss [[Rhaetian Railway Ge 6/6 I]] [[Crocodile (locomotive)|Krokodil]] locomotive, with a single large traction motor above each bogie, with drive by coupling rods.]]\nTraditionally, these were [[Universal motor|series-wound brushed DC motors]], usually running on approximately 600 volts. The availability of high-powered semiconductors ([[thyristors]] and the [[IGBT]]) has now made practical the use of much simpler, higher-reliability [[Alternating current|AC]] [[induction motor]]s known as asynchronous traction motors. [[synchronous motor|Synchronous AC motors]] are also occasionally used, as in the French [[TGV]].\n\n====Mounting of motors====\nBefore the mid-20th century, a single large motor was often used to drive multiple [[driving wheel]]s through [[connecting rod#Steam engines|connecting rods]] that were very similar to those used on [[steam locomotive]]s. Examples are the [[PRR DD1|Pennsylvania Railroad DD1]], [[PRR FF1|FF1]] and [[PRR L5|L5]] and the various [[Crocodile (locomotive)|Swiss Crocodiles]]. It is now standard practice to provide one traction motor driving each axle through a gear drive.\n\n[[File:Class 181 traction motor2.jpg|thumb|Nose-suspended traction motor for a Czech [[\u010cSD Class E 669.2|\u010cD class 182]] locomotive]]\nUsually, the traction motor is three-point suspended between the [[bogie]] frame and the driven axle; this is referred to as a \"nose-suspended traction motor\". The problem with such an arrangement is that a portion of the motor's weight is [[unsprung weight|unsprung]], increasing unwanted forces on the track. In the case of the famous Pennsylvania Railroad [[PRR GG1|GG1]], two bogie-mounted motors drove each axle through a [[quill drive]]. The \"[[Milwaukee Road class EP-2|Bi-Polar]]\" electric locomotives built by [[General Electric]] for the [[Milwaukee Road]] had direct drive motors. The rotating shaft of the motor was also the axle for the wheels. In the case of French TGV [[power car]]s, a motor mounted to the power car\u2019s frame drives each axle; a \"tripod\" drive allows a small amount of flexibility in the drive train allowing the trucks bogies to pivot. By mounting the relatively heavy traction motor directly to the power car's frame, rather than to the bogie, better dynamics are obtained, allowing better high-speed operation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/tgvpages/motrice.html|title=TGVweb - \"Under the Hood\" of a TGV|website=www.trainweb.org|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref>\n\n====Windings====\nThe DC motor was the mainstay of electric traction drives on electric and diesel-electric locomotives, street-cars/trams and diesel electric drilling rigs for many years. It consists of two parts, a rotating armature and fixed field windings surrounding the rotating armature mounted around a shaft. The fixed field windings consist of tightly wound coils of wire fitted inside the motor case. The armature is another set of coils wound round a central shaft and is connected to the field windings through \"brushes\" which are spring-loaded contacts pressing against an extension of the armature called the [[commutator (electric)|commutator]]. The commutator collects all the terminations of the armature coils and distributes them in a circular pattern to allow the correct sequence of current flow. When the armature and the field windings are connected in series, the whole motor is referred to as \"series-wound\". A series-wound DC motor has a low resistance field and armature circuit. For this reason, when voltage is applied to it, the current is high due to [[Ohm's law]]. The advantage of high current is that the magnetic fields inside the motor are strong, producing high torque (turning force), so it is ideal for starting a train. The disadvantage is that the current flowing into the motor has to be limited, otherwise the supply could be overloaded or the motor and its cabling could be damaged. At best, the torque would exceed the adhesion and the driving wheels would slip. Traditionally, [[resistor]]s were used to limit the initial current.\n\n====Power control====\nAs the DC motor starts to turn, interaction of the magnetic fields inside causes it to generate a voltage internally. This [[counter-electromotive force]] (CEMF) opposes the applied voltage and the current that flows is governed by the difference between the two. As the motor speeds up, the internally generated voltage rises, the resultant EMF falls, less current passes through the motor and the torque drops. The motor naturally stops accelerating when the drag of the train matches the torque produced by the motors. To continue accelerating the train, series resistors are switched out step by step, each step increasing the effective voltage and thus the current and torque for a little bit longer until the motor catches up. This can be heard and felt in older DC trains as a series of clunks under the floor, each accompanied by a jerk of acceleration as the torque suddenly increases in response to the new surge of current. When no resistors are left in the circuit, full line voltage is applied directly to the motor. The train's speed remains constant at the point where the torque of the motor, governed by the effective voltage, equals the drag - sometimes referred to as balancing speed. If the train starts to climb an incline, the speed decreases because drag is greater than torque and the reduction in speed causes the CEMF to fall and thus the effective voltage to rise - until the current through the motor produces enough torque to match the new drag. The use of series resistance was wasteful because a lot of energy was lost as heat. To reduce these losses, [[electric locomotive]]s and trains (before the advent of [[power electronics]]) were normally equipped for [[series-parallel control]] as well.\n\n====Dynamic braking====\nIf the train starts to descend a grade, the speed increases because the (reduced) drag is less than the torque. With increased speed, the internally generated back-EMF voltage rises, reducing the torque until the torque again balances the drag. Because the field current is reduced by the back-EMF in a series wound motor, there is no speed at which the back-EMF will exceed the supply voltage, and therefore a single series wound DC traction motor alone cannot provide dynamic or regenerative braking.\n\nThere are, however various schemes applied to provide a retarding force using the traction motors. The energy generated may be returned to the supply (regenerative braking), or dissipated by on board resistors (dynamic braking). Such a system can bring the load to a low speed, requiring relatively little friction braking to bring the load to a full stop.\n\n====Automatic acceleration====\nOn an electric train, the train driver originally had to control the cutting out of resistance manually, but by 1914, automatic acceleration was being used. This was achieved by an accelerating relay (often called a \"notching relay\") in the motor circuit which monitored the fall of current as each step of resistance was cut out. All the driver had to do was select low, medium or full speed (called \"series\", \"parallel\" and \"shunt\" from the way the motors were connected in the resistance circuit) and the automatic equipment would do the rest.\n\n==Rating==\n[[Electric locomotive]]s usually have a ''continuous'' and a ''one-hour'' rating. The one-hour rating is the maximum power that the motors can continuously develop over a one-hour period without overheating. Such a test starts with the motors at +25&nbsp;\u00b0C (and the outside air used for ventilation also at +25&nbsp;\u00b0C). In the USSR, per GOST 2582-72 with class N insulation, the maximum temperatures allowed for DC motors were 160&nbsp;\u00b0C for the armature, 180&nbsp;\u00b0C for the stator, and 105&nbsp;\u00b0C for the collector.<ref>\u0421\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 1980, p.47</ref>  The one-hour rating is typically about ten percent higher than the continuous rating, and limited by the temperature rise in the motor.\n\nAs traction motors use a reduction gear setup to transfer torque from the motor armature to the driven axle, the actual load placed on the motor varies with the gear ratio. Otherwise \"identical\" traction motors can have significantly different load rating. A traction motor geared for freight use with a [[low gear]] ratio will safely produce higher torque at the wheels for a longer period at the same current level because the lower gears give the motor more mechanical advantage.\n\nIn [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] and [[gas turbine-electric locomotive]]s, the [[horsepower]] rating of the traction motors is usually around 81% that of the [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]. This assumes that the [[electrical generator]] converts 90% of the engine's output into electrical energy and the traction motors convert 90% of this electrical energy back into mechanical energy.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Calculation: 0.9 \u00d7 0.9 = 0.81\n\nIndividual traction motor ratings usually range up 1,600&nbsp;kW (2,144&nbsp;hp)\n\nAnother important factor when traction motors are designed or specified is operational speed. The motor armature has a maximum safe rotating speed at or below which the windings will stay safely in place.\n\nAbove this maximum speed centrifugal force on the armature will cause the windings to be thrown outward. In severe cases, this can lead to \"birdnesting\" as the windings contact the motor housing and eventually break loose from the armature entirely and uncoil.\n\nBird-nesting due to overspeed can occur either in operating traction motors of powered locomotives or in traction motors of dead-in-consist locomotives being transported within a train traveling too fast. Another cause is replacement of worn or damaged traction motors with units incorrectly geared for the application.\n\nDamage from overloading and overheating can also cause bird-nesting below rated speeds when the armature assembly and winding supports and retainers have been damaged by the previous abuse.\n\n==Cooling==\nBecause of the high power levels involved, traction motors are almost always cooled using forced air, water or a special dielectric liquid.\n\nTypical cooling systems on U.S. diesel-electric locomotives consist of an electrically-powered fan blowing air into a passage integrated into the locomotive frame. Rubber cooling ducts connect the passage to the individual traction motors and cooling air travels down and across the armatures before being exhausted to the atmosphere.\n\n== Manufacturers ==\n{{main|List of traction motor manufacturers}}\n\n==See also==\n {{div col}}\n* [[Air cooling]]\n* [[Electric vehicle battery]]\n* [[Induction motor]] & [[Three-phase AC railway electrification]]\n* [[Rare earths]]\n* [[Torque and speed of a DC motor]]\n* [[Diesel-electric transmission]]\n {{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book\n  |title=Diesel Traction Manual for Enginemen\n  |author=British Railways\n  |publisher=British Transport Commission\n  |edition=1st\n  |year=1962\n  |ref={{harvid|Diesel Traction|1962}}\n  |chapter=Section 13: Traction Control\n  |pages=172\u2013189\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |title=The Railwayman's Diesel Manual\n  |last=Bolton  |first=William F.\n  |edition=4th\n  |year=1963\n  |ref={{harvid|Diesel Manual|1963}}\n  |pages=107\u2013111, 184\u2013190\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Traction motors (rail transport)|Traction motors}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120204150932/http://www.associatedrewinds.com/english/deconstructingmotor.html \"Deconstructing a traction motor - Associated Rewinds (Ireland) Limited\"]\n* [http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?7591 Image of a nose mounted traction motor on an [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46] New York City Subway car.

An AC induction motor only generates useful amounts of power over a narrow speed range determined by its construction and the frequency of the AC power supply. The advent of [[power semiconductor device|power semiconductors]] has made it possible to fit a [[variable frequency drive]] on a locomotive; this allows a wide range of speeds, AC power transmission, and rugged induction motors without wearing parts like brushes and commutators.<ref name=AS08>Andreas Steimel ''Electric Traction - Motive Power and Energy Supply: Basics and Practical Experience '' Oldenbourg Industrieverlag, 2008 {{ISBN|3835631322}} ; Chapter 6 \"Induction Traction Motors and Their Control\"</ref>\n\n==Transportation applications==\n\n===Road vehicles===\n{{see also|Hybrid electric vehicle|battery electric vehicle}}\nTraditionally road vehicles (cars, buses and trucks) have used diesel and petrol engines with a mechanical or hydraulic transmission system. In the latter part of the 20th century, vehicles with electrical transmission systems (powered from [[internal combustion engine]]s, batteries or [[fuel cells]]) began to be developed\u2014one advantage of using electric machines is that specific types can regenerate energy (i.e. act as a [[regenerative brake]])\u2014providing deceleration as well as increasing overall efficiency by charging the battery pack.\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:Ge 6-6 I 407 Krokodil.jpeg|thumb|Swiss [[Rhaetian Railway Ge 6/6 I]] [[Crocodile (locomotive)|Krokodil]] locomotive, with a single large traction motor above each bogie, with drive by coupling rods.]]\nTraditionally, these were [[Universal motor|series-wound brushed DC motors]], usually running on approximately 600 volts. The availability of high-powered semiconductors ([[thyristors]] and the [[IGBT]]) has now made practical the use of much simpler, higher-reliability [[Alternating current|AC]] [[induction motor]]s known as asynchronous traction motors. [[synchronous motor|Synchronous AC motors]] are also occasionally used, as in the French [[TGV]].\n\n====Mounting of motors====\nBefore the mid-20th century, a single large motor was often used to drive multiple [[driving wheel]]s through [[connecting rod#Steam engines|connecting rods]] that were very similar to those used on [[steam locomotive]]s. Examples are the [[PRR DD1|Pennsylvania Railroad DD1]], [[PRR FF1|FF1]] and [[PRR L5|L5]] and the various [[Crocodile (locomotive)|Swiss Crocodiles]]. It is now standard practice to provide one traction motor driving each axle through a gear drive.\n\n[[File:Class 181 traction motor2.jpg|thumb|Nose-suspended traction motor for a Czech [[\u010cSD Class E 669.2|\u010cD class 182]] locomotive]]\nUsually, the traction motor is three-point suspended between the [[bogie]] frame and the driven axle; this is referred to as a \"nose-suspended traction motor\". The problem with such an arrangement is that a portion of the motor's weight is [[unsprung weight|unsprung]], increasing unwanted forces on the track. In the case of the famous Pennsylvania Railroad [[PRR GG1|GG1]], two bogie-mounted motors drove each axle through a [[quill drive]]. The \"[[Milwaukee Road class EP-2|Bi-Polar]]\" electric locomotives built by [[General Electric]] for the [[Milwaukee Road]] had direct drive motors. The rotating shaft of the motor was also the axle for the wheels. In the case of French TGV [[power car]]s, a motor mounted to the power car\u2019s frame drives each axle; a \"tripod\" drive allows a small amount of flexibility in the drive train allowing the trucks bogies to pivot. By mounting the relatively heavy traction motor directly to the power car's frame, rather than to the bogie, better dynamics are obtained, allowing better high-speed operation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/tgvpages/motrice.html|title=TGVweb - \"Under the Hood\" of a TGV|website=www.trainweb.org|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref>\n\n====Windings====\nThe DC motor was the mainstay of electric traction drives on electric and diesel-electric locomotives, street-cars/trams and diesel electric drilling rigs for many years. It consists of two parts, a rotating armature and fixed field windings surrounding the rotating armature mounted around a shaft. The fixed field windings consist of tightly wound coils of wire fitted inside the motor case. The armature is another set of coils wound round a central shaft and is connected to the field windings through \"brushes\" which are spring-loaded contacts pressing against an extension of the armature called the [[commutator (electric)|commutator]]. The commutator collects all the terminations of the armature coils and distributes them in a circular pattern to allow the correct sequence of current flow. When the armature and the field windings are connected in series, the whole motor is referred to as \"series-wound\". A series-wound DC motor has a low resistance field and armature circuit. For this reason, when voltage is applied to it, the current is high due to [[Ohm's law]]. The advantage of high current is that the magnetic fields inside the motor are strong, producing high torque (turning force), so it is ideal for starting a train. The disadvantage is that the current flowing into the motor has to be limited, otherwise the supply could be overloaded or the motor and its cabling could be damaged. At best, the torque would exceed the adhesion and the driving wheels would slip. Traditionally, [[resistor]]s were used to limit the initial current.\n\n====Power control====\nAs the DC motor starts to turn, interaction of the magnetic fields inside causes it to generate a voltage internally. This [[counter-electromotive force]] (CEMF) opposes the applied voltage and the current that flows is governed by the difference between the two. As the motor speeds up, the internally generated voltage rises, the resultant EMF falls, less current passes through the motor and the torque drops. The motor naturally stops accelerating when the drag of the train matches the torque produced by the motors. To continue accelerating the train, series resistors are switched out step by step, each step increasing the effective voltage and thus the current and torque for a little bit longer until the motor catches up. This can be heard and felt in older DC trains as a series of clunks under the floor, each accompanied by a jerk of acceleration as the torque suddenly increases in response to the new surge of current. When no resistors are left in the circuit, full line voltage is applied directly to the motor. The train's speed remains constant at the point where the torque of the motor, governed by the effective voltage, equals the drag - sometimes referred to as balancing speed. If the train starts to climb an incline, the speed decreases because drag is greater than torque and the reduction in speed causes the CEMF to fall and thus the effective voltage to rise - until the current through the motor produces enough torque to match the new drag. The use of series resistance was wasteful because a lot of energy was lost as heat. To reduce these losses, [[electric locomotive]]s and trains (before the advent of [[power electronics]]) were normally equipped for [[series-parallel control]] as well.\n\n====Dynamic braking====\nIf the train starts to descend a grade, the speed increases because the (reduced) drag is less than the torque. With increased speed, the internally generated back-EMF voltage rises, reducing the torque until the torque again balances the drag. Because the field current is reduced by the back-EMF in a series wound motor, there is no speed at which the back-EMF will exceed the supply voltage, and therefore a single series wound DC traction motor alone cannot provide dynamic or regenerative braking.\n\nThere are, however various schemes applied to provide a retarding force using the traction motors. The energy generated may be returned to the supply (regenerative braking), or dissipated by on board resistors (dynamic braking). Such a system can bring the load to a low speed, requiring relatively little friction braking to bring the load to a full stop.\n\n====Automatic acceleration====\nOn an electric train, the train driver originally had to control the cutting out of resistance manually, but by 1914, automatic acceleration was being used. This was achieved by an accelerating relay (often called a \"notching relay\") in the motor circuit which monitored the fall of current as each step of resistance was cut out. All the driver had to do was select low, medium or full speed (called \"series\", \"parallel\" and \"shunt\" from the way the motors were connected in the resistance circuit) and the automatic equipment would do the rest.\n\n==Rating==\n[[Electric locomotive]]s usually have a ''continuous'' and a ''one-hour'' rating. The one-hour rating is the maximum power that the motors can continuously develop over a one-hour period without overheating. Such a test starts with the motors at +25&nbsp;\u00b0C (and the outside air used for ventilation also at +25&nbsp;\u00b0C). In the USSR, per GOST 2582-72 with class N insulation, the maximum temperatures allowed for DC motors were 160&nbsp;\u00b0C for the armature, 180&nbsp;\u00b0C for the stator, and 105&nbsp;\u00b0C for the collector.<ref>\u0421\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 1980, p.47</ref>  The one-hour rating is typically about ten percent higher than the continuous rating, and limited by the temperature rise in the motor.\n\nAs traction motors use a reduction gear setup to transfer torque from the motor armature to the driven axle, the actual load placed on the motor varies with the gear ratio. Otherwise \"identical\" traction motors can have significantly different load rating. A traction motor geared for freight use with a [[low gear]] ratio will safely produce higher torque at the wheels for a longer period at the same current level because the lower gears give the motor more mechanical advantage.\n\nIn [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] and [[gas turbine-electric locomotive]]s, the [[horsepower]] rating of the traction motors is usually around 81% that of the [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]. This assumes that the [[electrical generator]] converts 90% of the engine's output into electrical energy and the traction motors convert 90% of this electrical energy back into mechanical energy.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Calculation: 0.9 \u00d7 0.9 = 0.81\n\nIndividual traction motor ratings usually range up 1,600&nbsp;kW (2,144&nbsp;hp)\n\nAnother important factor when traction motors are designed or specified is operational speed. The motor armature has a maximum safe rotating speed at or below which the windings will stay safely in place.\n\nAbove this maximum speed centrifugal force on the armature will cause the windings to be thrown outward. In severe cases, this can lead to \"birdnesting\" as the windings contact the motor housing and eventually break loose from the armature entirely and uncoil.\n\nBird-nesting due to overspeed can occur either in operating traction motors of powered locomotives or in traction motors of dead-in-consist locomotives being transported within a train traveling too fast. Another cause is replacement of worn or damaged traction motors with units incorrectly geared for the application.\n\nDamage from overloading and overheating can also cause bird-nesting below rated speeds when the armature assembly and winding supports and retainers have been damaged by the previous abuse.\n\n==Cooling==\nBecause of the high power levels involved, traction motors are almost always cooled using forced air, water or a special dielectric liquid.\n\nTypical cooling systems on U.S. diesel-electric locomotives consist of an electrically-powered fan blowing air into a passage integrated into the locomotive frame. Rubber cooling ducts connect the passage to the individual traction motors and cooling air travels down and across the armatures before being exhausted to the atmosphere.\n\n== Manufacturers ==\n{{main|List of traction motor manufacturers}}\n\n==See also==\n {{div col}}\n* [[Air cooling]]\n* [[Electric vehicle battery]]\n* [[Induction motor]] & [[Three-phase AC railway electrification]]\n* [[Rare earths]]\n* [[Torque and speed of a DC motor]]\n* [[Diesel-electric transmission]]\n {{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book\n  |title=Diesel Traction Manual for Enginemen\n  |author=British Railways\n  |publisher=British Transport Commission\n  |edition=1st\n  |year=1962\n  |ref={{harvid|Diesel Traction|1962}}\n  |chapter=Section 13: Traction Control\n  |pages=172\u2013189\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |title=The Railwayman's Diesel Manual\n  |last=Bolton  |first=William F.\n  |edition=4th\n  |year=1963\n  |ref={{harvid|Diesel Manual|1963}}\n  |pages=107\u2013111, 184\u2013190\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Traction motors (rail transport)|Traction motors}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120204150932/http://www.associatedrewinds.com/english/deconstructingmotor.html \"Deconstructing a traction motor - Associated Rewinds (Ireland) Limited\"]\n* [http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?7591 Image of a nose mounted traction motor on an [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46] New York City Subway car.

The [[Union Pacific]]'s old Los Angeles and Salt Lake line to the harbor ran just east of that location, and the main lines of the [[Southern Pacific]] and [[Santa Fe Railroad|Santa Fe]] ran by just north of there as well.
