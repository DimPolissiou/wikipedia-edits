The fire killed approximately 300 people, destroyed roughly {{convert|3.3|sqmi|km2|0}} of the city, and left more than 100,000 residents homeless.<ref name=Rayfield1997 />  The fire began in a neighborhood southwest of the city center. A long period of hot, dry, windy conditions, and the wooden construction prevalent in the city led to a [[conflagration]]. The fire leapt the south branch of the [[Chicago River]] and destroyed much of central Chicago and then leapt the main branch of the river, consuming the near north side.\n\nHelp flowed to the city from near and far after the fire. The city government improved building codes to stop the rapid spread of future fires and rebuilt rapidly to those higher standards. A donation from the United Kingdom spurred the establishment of the [[Chicago Public Library]], a free public library system, a contrast to the private, fee-for-membership libraries common before the fire.\n\n/* Spread */ \nThe spread of the Chicago fire lasted 2 days. It was finally put out when it started to rain on October 9.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Chicago-fire2.jpeg|thumb|Aftermath of the fire, corner of Dearborn and Monroe Streets, 1871]]\n\nOnce the fire had ended, the smoldering remains were still too hot for a survey of the damage to be completed for many days.

H. Burgess of London proposed an \"English Book Donation\", to spur a free library in Chicago, in their sympathy with Chicago over the damages suffered.<ref name=CPL /> Libraries in Chicago had been private with membership fees. In April 1872, the City Council passed the ordinance to establish the free [[Chicago Public Library]], starting with the donation from the United Kingdom of more than 8,000 volumes.<ref name=CPL>{{cite web |url=https://www.chipublib.org/cpl-history/ |title=CPL History, 1871-1872 |publisher=Chicago Public Library |accessdate=September 26, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe fire also led to questions about development in the United States. Due to Chicago's rapid expansion at that time, the fire led to Americans reflecting on industrialization. Based on a religious point of view, some said that Americans should return to a more old-fashioned way of life, and that the fire was caused by people ignoring traditional morality. On the other hand, others believed that a lesson to be learned from the fire was that cities needed to improve their building techniques. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] observed that poor building practices in Chicago were a problem:<ref name=Pauly673/>\n\n<blockquote>Chicago had a weakness for \"big things\", and liked to think that it was outbuilding New York. It did a great deal of commercial advertising in its house-tops. The faults of construction as well as of art in its great showy buildings must have been numerous. Their walls were thin, and were overweighted with gross and coarse misornamentation.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Cheer up.jpg|thumb|''Chicago Tribune'' editorial]]\n\nOlmsted also believed that with brick walls, and disciplined firemen and police, the deaths and damage caused would have been much less.<ref name=Pauly673>{{cite journal |first=John J. |last=Pauly |title=The Great Chicago Fire as a National Event |journal=American Quarterly |volume=36 |number=5 |date=Winter 1984 |pages=673\u2013674 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=2712866}}</ref>\n\nAlmost immediately, the city began to rewrite its fire standards, spurred by the efforts of leading insurance executives, and fire-prevention reformers such as [[Arthur C. Ducat]]. Chicago soon developed one of the country's leading fire-fighting forces.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:World Columbian Exposition - White City - 1.JPG|thumb|More than 20 years after the Great Fire, 'The World Colombian Exposition of 1893', known as the 'White City', for being lit up with newly invented light bulbs and electric power.]]\nBusiness owners, and land speculators such as [[Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard]], quickly set about rebuilding the city. The first load of lumber for rebuilding was delivered the day the last burning building was extinguished. By the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] 22 years later, Chicago hosted more than 21 million visitors. The [[Palmer House]] hotel burned to the ground in the fire 13 days after its grand opening. Its developer, [[Potter Palmer]], secured a loan and rebuilt the hotel to higher standards across the street from the original, proclaiming it to be \"The World's First Fireproof Building\".{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 1956, the remaining structures on the original O'Leary property at 558 W. [[DeKoven Street (Chicago)|DeKoven Street]] were torn down for construction of the Chicago Fire Academy, a training facility for Chicago firefighters, known as the Quinn Fire Academy or Chicago Fire Department Training Facility. A bronze [[sculpture]] of stylized flames, entitled ''Pillar of Fire'' by sculptor [[Egon Weiner]], was erected on the point of origin in 1961.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/S/SiteChicagoFire.html |title=Chicago Landmarks |accessdate=December 14, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504194842/http://www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/S/SiteChicagoFire.html |archive-date=May 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Surviving structures==\n[[File:pre fire house in Chicago on Fullerton  2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A pre-fire house in Chicago on Cleveland Avenue (photographed in 2016)]]\n\n<!-- Do not add St. Ignatius High School, Old St. Patrick's Church, or Holy Family Church.

Donnelly]] in ''[[Ragnarok: The Age of Fire and Gravel]]'', is that the fire was caused by a [[meteor shower]]. This was described as a \"fringe theory\" concerning [[Biela's Comet#Meteoric impacts|Biela's Comet]]. At a 2004 conference of the Aerospace Corporation and the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]], engineer and physicist Robert Wood suggested that the fire began when [[Biela's Comet]] broke up over the Midwest. That four large fires took place, all on the same day, all on the shores of [[Lake Michigan]] (see [[#Related events|Related Events]]), suggests a common root cause. Eyewitnesses reported sighting spontaneous ignitions, lack of smoke, \"balls of fire\" falling from the sky, and blue flames.

A long period of hot, dry, windy conditions, and the wooden construction prevalent in the city led to a [[conflagration]]. The fire leapt the south branch of the [[Chicago River]] and destroyed much of central Chicago and then leapt the main branch of the river, consuming the near north side.\n\nHelp flowed to the city from near and far after the fire. The city government improved building codes to stop the rapid spread of future fires and rebuilt rapidly to those higher standards. A donation from the United Kingdom spurred the establishment of the [[Chicago Public Library]], a free public library system, a contrast to the private, fee-for-membership libraries common before the fire.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:1871 Chicago view before the Great Conflagration.jpg|thumb|right|1871 Chicago view before the 'Great Conflagration']]\nThe fire is claimed to have started at about 9:00&nbsp;p.m. on October&nbsp;8, in or around a small barn belonging to the O'Leary family that bordered the alley behind 137 [[DeKoven Street (Chicago)|DeKoven Street]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Pierce |first=Bessie Louise |authorlink=Bessie Louise Pierce |title=A History of Chicago: Volume III: The Rise of a Modern City, 1871\u20131893 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |orig-year=1957 |year=2007 |version=Republished |location=Chicago |page=4 |isbn=978-0-226-66842-0}}</ref> The shed next to the barn was the first building to be consumed by the fire.

There has been much speculation over the years on a single start to the fire. The most popular tale blames [[Catherine O'Leary|Mrs. O'Leary's cow]], who allegedly knocked over a lantern; others state that a group of men were gambling inside the barn and knocked over a lantern.<ref name=\"JimMurphy\"/> Still other speculation suggests that the blaze was related to [[:Category:1871 fires|other fires in the Midwest that day]].<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\"/>\n\nThe fire's spread was aided by the city's use of wood as the predominant building material in a style called [[Framing (construction)#Balloon framing|balloon frame]]. More than two-thirds of the structures in Chicago at the time of the fire were made entirely of wood, with most of the houses and buildings being topped with highly flammable [[tar]] or [[Roof shingle|shingle]] roofs.

Firefighters had hoped that the South Branch of the Chicago River and an area that had previously thoroughly burned would act as a natural [[firebreak]].<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\"/>{{rp|147}} All along the river, however, were lumber yards, warehouses, and coal yards, and barges and numerous bridges across the river.

Around midnight, flaming debris blew across the river and landed on roofs and the South Side Gas Works.<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\"/>{{rp|148}}\n\nWith the fire across the river and moving rapidly toward the heart of the city, panic set in. About this time, Mayor [[Roswell B. Mason]] sent messages to nearby towns asking for help.

Due to Chicago's rapid expansion at that time, the fire led to Americans reflecting on industrialization. Based on a religious point of view, some said that Americans should return to a more old-fashioned way of life, and that the fire was caused by people ignoring traditional morality. On the other hand, others believed that a lesson to be learned from the fire was that cities needed to improve their building techniques. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] observed that poor building practices in Chicago were a problem:<ref name=Pauly673/>\n\n<blockquote>Chicago had a weakness for \"big things\", and liked to think that it was outbuilding New York. It did a great deal of commercial advertising in its house-tops. The faults of construction as well as of art in its great showy buildings must have been numerous. Their walls were thin, and were overweighted with gross and coarse misornamentation.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Cheer up.jpg|thumb|''Chicago Tribune'' editorial]]\n\nOlmsted also believed that with brick walls, and disciplined firemen and police, the deaths and damage caused would have been much less.<ref name=Pauly673>{{cite journal |first=John J. |last=Pauly |title=The Great Chicago Fire as a National Event |journal=American Quarterly |volume=36 |number=5 |date=Winter 1984 |pages=673\u2013674 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=2712866}}</ref>\n\nAlmost immediately, the city began to rewrite its fire standards, spurred by the efforts of leading insurance executives, and fire-prevention reformers such as [[Arthur C.

Chicago soon developed one of the country's leading fire-fighting forces.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:World Columbian Exposition - White City - 1.JPG|thumb|More than 20 years after the Great Fire, 'The World Colombian Exposition of 1893', known as the 'White City', for being lit up with newly invented light bulbs and electric power.]]\nBusiness owners, and land speculators such as [[Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard]], quickly set about rebuilding the city.
