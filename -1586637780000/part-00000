Photography, to her, is not an instrument of memory but also a tool for the invention of memory. At the Woman ''Wanted'' exhibition at the Hong Kong Heritage Museum, she display the photograph reconstructed by her in a way that she recruits her friends to simulate the original in the 1930s. She also create the Polaroid series to simulate crime scene in a still frame in a way that mimic thriller film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Light and meaning ====\nWong has her persistent interest in spatial and temporal exchange. Her work uses light, coming in through different forms and materials and with space and non-space to symbolise transitions from the known to the unknown, especially for the photography taken during her travel journey. Viewers of the work tend to turn around the work having their focuses unknowingly shifted.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Advisory and education ====\nWong is also one of the founding members of Hong Kong International Photo Festival (Hong Kong Photographic Culture Association), and has been the Museum Honorary Advisor for the [[Leisure and Cultural Services Department]] since 1996.\n\nWong had also taught photography and communication at [[Hong Kong Arts Centre]] and multiples universities in Hong Kong, such as [[The University of Hong Kong]] and [[The Chinese University of Hong Kong]] and worked as a researcher at [[Hong Kong Heritage Museum]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Awards and achievements ==\n*1975\u201377 Columbus College of Art and Design \u2013 College Grant\n*1977\u201379 Tyler School of Art, Temple University \u2013 Fellowship and Scholarship\n*1994 Asian Cultural Council \u2013 Fellowship\n*1995 International Institute of Education \u2013 Fellowship on Chinese Women Leadership Programme\n*2010 The Certificate of Commendation from the Secretary of Home Affairs, Hong Kong\n*2013 Hong Kong Women Excellence in the Six Arts, Hong Kong Federation of Women\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n=== Solo Exhibitions ===\n*1981  \"Colour Images\", [[Hong Kong Arts Centre]] (Presented by the Polaroid Far East Limited), Hong Kong\n*1985  \"Photography Exhibition by Wong Wo Bik\", USIS American Library, Hong Kong\n*1986  \"Impression\", [[Alliance Fran\u00e7aise|Alliance Francaise]] de Hong Kong, Hong Kong\n*1988  \"Plastic Motion\", a photo-installation collaborating with a dance performance aurelo, [[City Contemporary Dance Company]]\u2019s gallery and theatre, Hong Kong\n*2009  \"Seized Moments: The Photographic Journey of Wong Wo Bik\", [[Hong Kong Fringe Club]] (Organized by Asia One Product & Publishing Limited), Hong Kong\n*2011 \"Memory and Fiction\", Blindspot Gallery, Hong Kong\n*2014 \"Not Just a Fashion Parade\", Lumenvisum, Hong Kong<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lumenvisum.org/site/exhibition/not-just-a-fashion-parade-wong-wo-bik/|title=Not just a Fashion Parade: Wong Wo Bik {{!}} Lumenvisum|access-date=9 March 2019}}</ref>\n*2017 \"City of Exchange: Liverpool/Hong Kong\", [[Open Eye Gallery]], Liverpool, UK, as part of the [[Look Photo Biennial|Liverpool International Photography Festival]]\n\n=== Group Exhibitions ===\n*1978 \"East Coast Consortium\", Tyler School of Art, Temple University, USA<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Collections ==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=January 2015}}\n*[[Archive of Modern Conflict]], London, UK<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Guangdong Museum of Art, Guangzhou, China.\n*[[Hong Kong Heritage Museum]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n*[[M+ Museum|Hong Kong M+ Museum]]<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wongwobik.com/about|title=About|website=Wong Wo Bik|access-date=9 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\n*{{cite book|last1=Tam|first1=Eve|last2=Wong Wo Bik|title=Hong Kong/China Photographers \u2013 Volume Four \u2013 Wong Wo Bik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uSNMQwAACAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Asia One Product & Publishing Limited|isbn=978-988-17998-5-2}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Wong Wo Bik (1983).

He made his televised in-ring debut by defeating [[Rip Rogers]] on the December 14 episode of ''[[WCW Saturday Night|World Championship Wrestling]]''. Bagwell made his pay-per-view debut at [[Starrcade (1991)|Starrcade]], where he was paired with [[Jimmy Garvin]] against [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]] and [[Tracy Smothers]] in a Lethal Lottery match, which Bagwell and Garvin won to qualify for the Battlebowl battle royal later in the night, which [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] won. Bagwell received his first title shot on the January 11, 1992 episode of ''World Championship Wrestling'' against [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] for the [[WCW World Television Championship|World Television Championship]], but failed to win the title as the match ended in a ten-minute time limit draw. Bagwell would then begin feuding with [[Terry Taylor|Terrance Taylor]], which led to a match between the two at [[SuperBrawl II]], which Bagwell won.\n\nBagwell formed a tag team with [[Tom Zenk]] on the February 15 episode of ''World Championship Wrestling'', to feud with Taylor and his partner [[Greg Valentine]] over the [[WCW United States Tag Team Championship|United States Tag Team Championship]] and received several title shots but failed to win the titles. Bagwell would then lose a match to [[Raven (wrestler)|Scotty Flamingo]] at [[WrestleWar (1992)|WrestleWar]]. The duo would participate in a tournament for the newly created [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]], where they would lose to [[Rick Rude]] and Steve Austin in the first round at ''[[Clash of the Champions XIX]]''. Bagwell would then face Greg Valentine in a losing effort at [[Beach Blast (1992)|Beach Blast]]. Bagwell and Zenk would fail in several title shots and after limited success as a team, they split up quietly and focused on their singles careers. He would then form a short-lived tag team with [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]] for the remainder of the year until the two split up in early 1993.\n\n====World Tag Team Champion (1993\u20131996)====\n{{Main|Stars and Stripes (professional wrestling)|l1=Stars and Stripes|The American Males}}\nBagwell participated in a tournament for the vacant World Television Championship on the February 20, 1993 episode of ''[[WCW Worldwide|Worldwide]]'', where he lost to [[Maxx Payne]] in the first round. On the February 20 episode of ''Saturday Night'', Bagwell teamed with [[2 Cold Scorpio]] and Steve Regal to defeat Scotty Flamingo, [[The Godwinns|Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce]] in a six-man tag team match. This would lead to the formation of a tag team of Bagwell and Scorpio. During this time, Bagwell began a feud with [[The Hollywood Blonds]] ([[Brian Pillman]] and Steve Austin), which led to Bagwell teaming with [[Erik Watts]] to take on Hollywood Blonds in a tag team match at [[SuperBrawl III]], which Bagwell's team lost. Bagwell resumed teaming with Scorpio and the team gained success unlike Bagwell's previous teams as they defeated various teams including [[Bobby Eaton]] and [[Chris Benoit]] at [[Slamboree (1993)|Slamboree]], Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce at [[Beach Blast (1993)|Beach Blast]] and [[Dave Sullivan (wrestler)|The Equalizer]] and [[Paul Orndorff]] at [[Fall Brawl (1993)|Fall Brawl]]. As a result of their success in the tag team division, they quickly became contenders for the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|World Tag Team Championship]]. On the October 23 episode of ''Saturday Night'', Bagwell and Scorpio defeated [[The Nasty Boys]] to win the World Tag Team Championship, thus marking Bagwell's first title win in WCW. They lost the titles back to Nasty Boys at [[Halloween Havoc (1993)|Halloween Havoc]].\n\nBagwell would be paired with Tex Slazenger against Rick Rude and Shanghai Pierce in a Battlebowl qualifying match at [[Battlebowl]] pay-per-view on November 20, which Bagwell's team lost. Bagwell and Scorpio would then begin feuding with the newly formed team [[Pretty Wonderful]], which led to a match at [[Starrcade (1993)|Starrcade]], which Pretty Wonderful won. However, Bagwell and Scorpio defeated Pretty Wonderful in a rematch at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXVI]]'' to earn a title shot for the World Tag Team Championship against Nasty Boys on the January 29, 1994 episode of ''Saturday Night'', but failed in regaining the titles. Bagwell received his first [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world championship]] title shot on the final episode of ''[[WCW Power Hour|Power Hour]]'' on March 5 against [[Rick Rude]] for the [[WCW International World Heavyweight Championship|International World Heavyweight Championship]], which he lost. Shortly after, Scorpio was released by WCW, thus dissolving Bagwell and Scorpio's tag team.\n\nOn the May 28 episode of ''Worldwide'', Bagwell formed a new tag team with [[The Patriot (wrestler)|The Patriot]] called Stars and Stripes as they defeated [[Dick Slater]] and Chris Sullivan in their first match as a team. They were quickly put in contention for the World Tag Team Championship and entered a feud with the champions Pretty Wonderful over the titles. After losing to Pretty Wonderful in a title shot at [[Fall Brawl (1994)|Fall Brawl]], Stars and Stripes defeated them in a rematch on the September 25 episode of ''[[WCW Main Event|Main Event]]'' to win the World Tag Team Championship, thus marking Bagwell's second reign with the title. They lost the titles back to Pretty Wonderful at [[Halloween Havoc (1994)|Halloween Havoc]] but won the titles a second time at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXIX]]''. They lost the titles to [[Harlem Heat]] on December 8, which aired on the January 14, 1995 episode of ''Saturday Night''. Stars and Stripes failed in regaining the titles from Harlem Heat in rematches at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXX]]'', the February 11 episode of ''Saturday Night'' and the March 5 episode of ''Worldwide''.\n\nBagwell would enter a tournament for the vacant [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Championship]], losing to [[Tonga Fifita|Meng]] in the opening round on the April 29 episode of ''Saturday Night''. Patriot left WCW in May and Bagwell resumed to singles competition while making makeshift tag teams with [[Jim Duggan]], [[Marc Mero|Johnny B. Badd]] and [[Alex Wright]] to regain the World Tag Team Championship but could not regain the titles.\n\nOn the September 16 episode of ''Saturday Night'', Bagwell formed a tag team with [[Scotty Riggs]] called The American Males as they defeated State Patrol in their debut match. The newly formed team defeated Harlem Heat to win the World Tag Team Championship on the September 18 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]''. They lost the titles back to Harlem Heat on the October 28 episode of ''Saturday Night''. Bagwell participated in the first-ever [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|World War 3 battle royal]] at the [[World War 3 (1995)|namesake event]] for the vacant [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Championship]], which was won by [[Randy Savage]]. American Males received a rematch for the tag team titles against Harlem Heat on the December 4 episode of ''Nitro'', which they failed to win. The team would find no success afterwards and would lose most of their matches throughout 1996. During this time, Bagwell made only two pay-per-view appearances; the first at [[The Great American Bash (1996)|The Great American Bash]], where he lost to [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and the second at [[World War 3 (1996)|World War 3]], where he participated in the namesake match with the winner earning a title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship but failed to win the match.\n\n====The New World Order (1996\u20131999)====\n{{see also|Vicious and Delicious}}\nOn November 25, 1996, Bagwell joined the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) after turning on his partner Scotty Riggs. He soon renamed himself to Buff Bagwell and formed a tag team with [[Scott Norton]] called [[Vicious and Delicious]]. To go along with his name change he developed the habits of flexing his muscles and would  talk to the camera insulting his opponents while complementing himself.  While with the nWo, he also competed for [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) as a part of nWo Japan, the NJPW version of the nWo. When he returned to America, he began a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Lex Luger]], which later saw Bagwell defeat him at [[Starrcade (1997)|Starrcade]].<ref name=\"Accl3359\"/><ref name=\"Solie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/newsletter/svwn252.html|author=Oliver, E.|title=Solie's Tuesday Morning Report|accessdate=April 16, 2007|date=December 8, 1997|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102614/http://www.solie.org/newsletter/svwn252.html|archivedate=September 29, 2007}}</ref>\n[[File:Buff Bagwell at Nitro 1998.jpg|thumb|right|Bagwell posing during a taping of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' in 1998]]\nOn the April 22, 1998 edition of ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'', Bagwell wrestled a match tag team match with [[Scott Norton]] (representing the nWo) against [[Rick Steiner]] and Lex Luger which they won when [[Scott Steiner]] interfered on his behalf.<ref name=WCWbio/> Just before that, however, Rick attempted his [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving bulldog|diving bulldog]] finishing move, which was not executed correctly and resulted in Bagwell's head striking Steiner's back, jamming his neck and severely injuring him. Bagwell was diagnosed with several damaged vertebrae and developed [[spinal shock]], leading him to use a [[wheelchair]] and neck brace for some time. He returned months later for an interview only to be viciously ridiculed by [[Hulk Hogan|Hollywood Hogan]] and shoved to the entryway floor.<ref name=\"Accl3359\"/> On July 6, after recently having neck surgery, the wheelchair-ridden Bagwell returned to WCW in his home state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bagwell seemed to have a new attitude and even called out Rick Steiner to offer him his forgiveness. However, Bagwell restrained Rick while fellow nWo member Scott Steiner assaulted him with a steel chair, reaffirming his loyalty to Hogan and the nWo. Bagwell then rose from his wheelchair and helped Scott beat down Rick. In January 1999, the nWo factions reunited, leading Bagwell and Steiner to side with the nWo Wolfpac. Their alliance ended at [[Uncensored (1999)|Uncensored]] when Bagwell accidentally hit Steiner with a chair, costing him the [[WCW World Television Championship|World Television Championship]].<ref name=\"Accl3359\"/>\n\n====The New Blood (1999\u20132000)====\n{{Main|The New Blood}}\n[[File:Lis&buff.jpg|thumb|left|Bagwell with a fan during his time in WCW.]]\nIn June 1999, Bagwell engaged in a rivalry with WCW President [[Ric Flair]] and Vice President [[Roddy Piper]] after claiming he was being held back. This led to a three-round [[boxing]] match with Piper at the [[Bash at the Beach (1999)|Bash at the Beach]], which saw Bagwell victorious. In September 1999, he feuded with [[Alex Wright|Berlyn]] when Berlyn issued a challenge to Bagwell, but at Fall Brawl, Bagwell was late coming to the arena and \"Hacksaw\" [[Jim Duggan]] replaced him. The next night on ''Nitro'', Bagwell lost to Berlyn after the interference of his bodyguard, [[Jerry Tuite|The Wall]]. In November, he defeated veteran [[Curt Hennig]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Retirement match|retirement match]]. Bagwell then feuded with [[Diamond Dallas Page]] after he made allegations about Page's wife [[Kimberly Page|Kimberly]]. Having spent much of 1999 feuding with older wrestlers, Bagwell was one of the first to join [[Eric Bischoff]]'s [[The New Blood|New Blood]] alliance, forming a tag team with [[Shane Douglas]] while both were members. Bagwell and Douglas eventually won the World Tag Team Championship from Ric Flair and Lex Luger, giving Bagwell his fifth World Tag Team Title reign and rekindling his feud with Luger from two years earlier. At [[Slamboree (2000)|Slamboree]], Luger defeated Bagwell via submission with the ''[[Backbreaker#Argentine backbreaker rack|Torture Rack]]''.<ref name=\"Accl3359\"/>\nOn May 9, 2000 following a ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'' taping in [[Springfield, Illinois]], Bagwell punched and yelled racial slurs at WCW crew member Darrell Miller after he and Bagwell began arguing when Miller attempted to carry equipment through a doorway in which Bagwell was standing. Six days later, Bagwell was charged with battery by the [[Sangamon County, Illinois]] [[State's Attorney]]'s office. In response, WCW suspended Bagwell for thirty days and stripped him of his half of the World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=\"Tearson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingclassics.com/wawli/Nos.729-735.html|author=Tearson, M.|title=A 'Scary Scene' Involving the Nature Boy|publisher=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|accessdate=April 16, 2007|date=May 23, 2000|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502044131/http://www.wrestlingclassics.com/wawli/Nos.729-735.html|archivedate=May 2, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Digest\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-661937_ITM|title=Buff Is the Jailbird Stuff|publisher=Wrestling Digest|accessdate=April 16, 2007|date=October 1, 2000|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153726/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-661937_ITM|archivedate=September 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nUpon his return, Bagwell attempted to win the World Tag Team Title with Douglas once more, but was unsuccessful. Bagwell, now with [[Torrie Wilson]] by his side, wrestled Douglas at [[Bash at the Beach (2000)|Bash at the Beach]], but lost when Wilson distracted him and sided with Douglas. Bagwell then began a feud with [[Chris Kanyon]], who began stalking him and harassing Bagwell's mother Judy as a psychological tactic. Bagwell eventually defeated Kanyon in a match where Judy was suspended from a [[forklift]]. He rescued his mother despite the surprise interference of actor [[David Arquette]].<ref name=\"Guttman\"/><ref name=\"Accl3359\"/> In August 2000, [[David Flair]]'s [[Kayfabe|storyline]] girlfriend [[Stacy Keibler|Miss Hancock]] mysteriously became pregnant. Flair quickly accused the [[Promiscuity|womanizing]] Bagwell, which led to a [[Professional wrestling match types#First Blood match|First Blood match]] at [[Halloween Havoc (2000)|Halloween Havoc]], with Flair hoping to obtain a sample of Bagwell's blood to prove he was the father of Hancock's child. Although Bagwell was victorious, Flair managed to get his blood sample when Bagwell's nemesis Lex Luger attacked him after the match. Bagwell was then revealed as not being the father, and the entire pregnancy was eventually found to have been a fabrication.<ref name=\"Accl3359\"/>\n\n====Totally Buffed (2000\u20132001)====\nAt [[Starrcade (2000)|Starrcade]], Bagwell, who at the time had returned as a backstage interviewer, betrayed [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] by trying to cost him his match with Lex Luger. Bagwell's efforts were unsuccessful, but he managed to hit Goldberg with a steel chair after he had pinned Luger. Despite feuding in the past, Bagwell and Luger united and became known as Totally Buffed. Totally Buffed would go on to defeat Goldberg at [[WCW Sin|Sin]] after a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Plant|fan]] [[Mace (spray)|maced]] Goldberg, allowing Bagwell to pin him. Due to a stipulation in the match, Goldberg was, [[Kayfabe|in storyline]], fired. In early 2001, Totally Buffed joined [[Ric Flair]]'s [[Magnificent Seven (professional wrestling)|Magnificent Seven]] stable, and remained with them until WCW's closure.<ref name=\"Accl3359\"/>\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (2001)===\nShortly after WCW was purchased by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in March 2001, Bagwell was one of the first [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]] contracted wrestlers to accept the offered buy-out on his contract and sign with the WWF. On July 1, 2001, Bagwell faced [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] at a [[house show]] and he made his WWF televised debut on the July 2 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw is War]]'', facing Booker T for the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW Championship]]. The match went to a no-contest after interference from [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Kurt Angle]].<ref name=oww/> When Bagwell arrived to the ''Raw'' tapings on July 9 in Atlanta, Georgia, he was informed he was being released from his contract due to complaints about his attitude and an altercation with fellow WCW alumnus [[Gregory Helms|Shane Helms]]. There were also accusations that Bagwell faked an injury at the July 3 ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' tapings after receiving an [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided powerbomb|aided powerbomb]] from the [[Acolytes Protection Agency]]. The accusations also claimed his mother Judy was calling WWF offices to request that her son get time off to heal from an injury supposedly inflicted to Bagwell from the aided powerbomb and to complain about her son's travel arrangements.<ref name=\"Guttman\"/><ref name=\"Accl3359\"/> However, Bagwell himself claims that he never understood why he was fired from the WWF.<ref name=BuffDecemeber>{{cite web|url=http://shiningwizards.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/episode-65-monday-night-wars-with-buff-bagwell-headbanger-thrasher/|title=Episode 65: Monday Night Wars with Buff Bagwell and Headbanger Thrasher|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312124537/http://shiningwizards.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/episode-65-monday-night-wars-with-buff-bagwell-headbanger-thrasher/|archivedate=March 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002, 2003, 2006)===\nAfter making several appearances with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] in 2002 and 2003, Bagwell returned to TNA on the April 27, 2006 episode of ''[[Impact!

Bagwell also appeared on the September 28 episode of ''Impact!'' in several segments, including a press conference, a video package, and a live segment where he briefly brawled with [[Jeff Jarrett]]. Bagwell also competed in two live events in TNA on December 15, 2006, Bagwell and [[Ron Killings]] defeated [[David Santo|David Young]] and [[Elix Skipper]] and the next night Bagwell and [[Rhyno|Rhino]] defeated David Young and Elix Skipper.

Bagwell received his first title shot on the January 11, 1992 episode of ''World Championship Wrestling'' against [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] for the [[WCW World Television Championship|World Television Championship]], but failed to win the title as the match ended in a ten-minute time limit draw. Bagwell would then begin feuding with [[Terry Taylor|Terrance Taylor]], which led to a match between the two at [[SuperBrawl II]], which Bagwell won.\n\nBagwell formed a tag team with [[Tom Zenk]] on the February 15 episode of ''World Championship Wrestling'', to feud with Taylor and his partner [[Greg Valentine]] over the [[WCW United States Tag Team Championship|United States Tag Team Championship]] and received several title shots but failed to win the titles. Bagwell would then lose a match to [[Raven (wrestler)|Scotty Flamingo]] at [[WrestleWar (1992)|WrestleWar]].

Bagwell would then face Greg Valentine in a losing effort at [[Beach Blast (1992)|Beach Blast]]. Bagwell and Zenk would fail in several title shots and after limited success as a team, they split up quietly and focused on their singles careers. He would then form a short-lived tag team with [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]] for the remainder of the year until the two split up in early 1993.\n\n====World Tag Team Champion (1993\u20131996)====\n{{Main|Stars and Stripes (professional wrestling)|l1=Stars and Stripes|The American Males}}\nBagwell participated in a tournament for the vacant World Television Championship on the February 20, 1993 episode of ''[[WCW Worldwide|Worldwide]]'', where he lost to [[Maxx Payne]] in the first round. On the February 20 episode of ''Saturday Night'', Bagwell teamed with [[2 Cold Scorpio]] and Steve Regal to defeat Scotty Flamingo, [[The Godwinns|Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce]] in a six-man tag team match. This would lead to the formation of a tag team of Bagwell and Scorpio. During this time, Bagwell began a feud with [[The Hollywood Blonds]] ([[Brian Pillman]] and Steve Austin), which led to Bagwell teaming with [[Erik Watts]] to take on Hollywood Blonds in a tag team match at [[SuperBrawl III]], which Bagwell's team lost. Bagwell resumed teaming with Scorpio and the team gained success unlike Bagwell's previous teams as they defeated various teams including [[Bobby Eaton]] and [[Chris Benoit]] at [[Slamboree (1993)|Slamboree]], Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce at [[Beach Blast (1993)|Beach Blast]] and [[Dave Sullivan (wrestler)|The Equalizer]] and [[Paul Orndorff]] at [[Fall Brawl (1993)|Fall Brawl]].

On the October 23 episode of ''Saturday Night'', Bagwell and Scorpio defeated [[The Nasty Boys]] to win the World Tag Team Championship, thus marking Bagwell's first title win in WCW. They lost the titles back to Nasty Boys at [[Halloween Havoc (1993)|Halloween Havoc]].\n\nBagwell would be paired with Tex Slazenger against Rick Rude and Shanghai Pierce in a Battlebowl qualifying match at [[Battlebowl]] pay-per-view on November 20, which Bagwell's team lost. Bagwell and Scorpio would then begin feuding with the newly formed team [[Pretty Wonderful]], which led to a match at [[Starrcade (1993)|Starrcade]], which Pretty Wonderful won. However, Bagwell and Scorpio defeated Pretty Wonderful in a rematch at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXVI]]'' to earn a title shot for the World Tag Team Championship against Nasty Boys on the January 29, 1994 episode of ''Saturday Night'', but failed in regaining the titles. Bagwell received his first [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world championship]] title shot on the final episode of ''[[WCW Power Hour|Power Hour]]'' on March 5 against [[Rick Rude]] for the [[WCW International World Heavyweight Championship|International World Heavyweight Championship]], which he lost. Shortly after, Scorpio was released by WCW, thus dissolving Bagwell and Scorpio's tag team.\n\nOn the May 28 episode of ''Worldwide'', Bagwell formed a new tag team with [[The Patriot (wrestler)|The Patriot]] called Stars and Stripes as they defeated [[Dick Slater]] and Chris Sullivan in their first match as a team. They were quickly put in contention for the World Tag Team Championship and entered a feud with the champions Pretty Wonderful over the titles. After losing to Pretty Wonderful in a title shot at [[Fall Brawl (1994)|Fall Brawl]], Stars and Stripes defeated them in a rematch on the September 25 episode of ''[[WCW Main Event|Main Event]]'' to win the World Tag Team Championship, thus marking Bagwell's second reign with the title. They lost the titles back to Pretty Wonderful at [[Halloween Havoc (1994)|Halloween Havoc]] but won the titles a second time at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXIX]]''. They lost the titles to [[Harlem Heat]] on December 8, which aired on the January 14, 1995 episode of ''Saturday Night''. Stars and Stripes failed in regaining the titles from Harlem Heat in rematches at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXX]]'', the February 11 episode of ''Saturday Night'' and the March 5 episode of ''Worldwide''.\n\nBagwell would enter a tournament for the vacant [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Championship]], losing to [[Tonga Fifita|Meng]] in the opening round on the April 29 episode of ''Saturday Night''. Patriot left WCW in May and Bagwell resumed to singles competition while making makeshift tag teams with [[Jim Duggan]], [[Marc Mero|Johnny B. Badd]] and [[Alex Wright]] to regain the World Tag Team Championship but could not regain the titles.\n\nOn the September 16 episode of ''Saturday Night'', Bagwell formed a tag team with [[Scotty Riggs]] called The American Males as they defeated State Patrol in their debut match.

Bagwell participated in the first-ever [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|World War 3 battle royal]] at the [[World War 3 (1995)|namesake event]] for the vacant [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Championship]], which was won by [[Randy Savage]]. American Males received a rematch for the tag team titles against Harlem Heat on the December 4 episode of ''Nitro'', which they failed to win. The team would find no success afterwards and would lose most of their matches throughout 1996. During this time, Bagwell made only two pay-per-view appearances; the first at [[The Great American Bash (1996)|The Great American Bash]], where he lost to [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and the second at [[World War 3 (1996)|World War 3]], where he participated in the namesake match with the winner earning a title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship but failed to win the match.\n\n====The New World Order (1996\u20131999)====\n{{see also|Vicious and Delicious}}\nOn November 25, 1996, Bagwell joined the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] after turning on his partner Scotty Riggs. He soon renamed himself to Buff Bagwell and formed a tag team with [[Scott Norton]] called [[Vicious and Delicious]]. To go along with his name change he developed the habits of flexing his muscles and would  talk to the camera insulting his opponents while complementing himself.  While with the nWo, he also competed for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) as a part of nWo Japan, the NJPW version of the nWo. When he returned to America, he began a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Lex Luger]], which later saw Bagwell defeat him at [[Starrcade (1997)|Starrcade]].<ref name=\"Accl3359\"/><ref name=\"Solie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/newsletter/svwn252.html|author=Oliver, E.|title=Solie's Tuesday Morning Report|accessdate=April 16, 2007|date=December 8, 1997|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102614/http://www.solie.org/newsletter/svwn252.html|archivedate=September 29, 2007}}</ref>\n[[File:Buff Bagwell at Nitro 1998.jpg|thumb|right|Bagwell posing during a taping of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' in 1998]]\nOn the April 22, 1998 edition of ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'', Bagwell wrestled a match tag team match with [[Scott Norton]] (representing the nWo) against [[Rick Steiner]] and Lex Luger which they won when [[Scott Steiner]] interfered on his behalf.<ref name=WCWbio/> Just before that, however, Rick attempted his [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving bulldog|diving bulldog]] finishing move, which was not executed correctly and resulted in Bagwell's head striking Steiner's back, jamming his neck and severely injuring him. Bagwell was diagnosed with several damaged vertebrae and developed [[spinal shock]], leading him to use a [[wheelchair]] and neck brace for some time. He returned months later for an interview only to be viciously ridiculed by [[Hulk Hogan|Hollywood Hogan]] and shoved to the entryway floor.<ref name=\"Accl3359\"/> On July 6, after recently having neck surgery, the wheelchair-ridden Bagwell returned to WCW in his home state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bagwell seemed to have a new attitude and even called out Rick Steiner to offer him his forgiveness. However, Bagwell restrained Rick while fellow nWo member Scott Steiner assaulted him with a steel chair, reaffirming his loyalty to Hogan and the nWo. Bagwell then rose from his wheelchair and helped Scott beat down Rick. In January 1999, the nWo factions reunited, leading Bagwell and Steiner to side with the nWo Wolfpac. Their alliance ended at [[Uncensored (1999)|Uncensored]] when Bagwell accidentally hit Steiner with a chair, costing him the [[WCW World Television Championship|World Television Championship]].<ref name=\"Accl3359\"/>\n\n====The New Blood (1999\u20132000)====\n{{Main|The New Blood}}\n[[File:Lis&buff.jpg|thumb|left|Bagwell with a fan during his time in WCW.]]\nIn June 1999, Bagwell engaged in a rivalry with WCW President [[Ric Flair]] and Vice President [[Roddy Piper]] after claiming he was being held back. This led to a three-round [[boxing]] match with Piper at the [[Bash at the Beach (1999)|Bash at the Beach]], which saw Bagwell victorious. In September 1999, he feuded with [[Alex Wright|Berlyn]] when Berlyn issued a challenge to Bagwell, but at Fall Brawl, Bagwell was late coming to the arena and \"Hacksaw\" [[Jim Duggan]] replaced him. The next night on ''Nitro'', Bagwell lost to Berlyn after the interference of his bodyguard, [[Jerry Tuite|The Wall]]. In November, he defeated veteran [[Curt Hennig]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Retirement match|retirement match]]. Bagwell then feuded with [[Diamond Dallas Page]] after he made allegations about Page's wife [[Kimberly Page|Kimberly]]. Having spent much of 1999 feuding with older wrestlers, Bagwell was one of the first to join [[Eric Bischoff]]'s [[The New Blood|New Blood]] alliance, forming a tag team with [[Shane Douglas]] while both were members. Bagwell and Douglas eventually won the World Tag Team Championship from Ric Flair and Lex Luger, giving Bagwell his fifth World Tag Team Title reign and rekindling his feud with Luger from two years earlier. At [[Slamboree (2000)|Slamboree]], Luger defeated Bagwell via submission with the ''[[Backbreaker#Argentine backbreaker rack|Torture Rack]]''.<ref name=\"Accl3359\"/>\nOn May 9, 2000 following a ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'' taping in [[Springfield, Illinois]], Bagwell punched and yelled racial slurs at WCW crew member Darrell Miller after he and Bagwell began arguing when Miller attempted to carry equipment through a doorway in which Bagwell was standing. Six days later, Bagwell was charged with battery by the [[Sangamon County, Illinois]] [[State's Attorney]]'s office.

Bagwell, now with [[Torrie Wilson]] by his side, wrestled Douglas at [[Bash at the Beach (2000)|Bash at the Beach]], but lost when Wilson distracted him and sided with Douglas. Bagwell then began a feud with [[Chris Kanyon]], who began stalking him and harassing Bagwell's mother Judy as a psychological tactic. Bagwell eventually defeated Kanyon in a match where Judy was suspended from a [[forklift]]. He rescued his mother despite the surprise interference of actor [[David Arquette]].<ref name=\"Guttman\"/><ref name=\"Accl3359\"/> In August 2000, [[David Flair]]'s [[Kayfabe|storyline]] girlfriend [[Stacy Keibler|Miss Hancock]] mysteriously became pregnant. Flair quickly accused the [[Promiscuity|womanizing]] Bagwell, which led to a [[Professional wrestling match types#First Blood match|First Blood match]] at [[Halloween Havoc (2000)|Halloween Havoc]], with Flair hoping to obtain a sample of Bagwell's blood to prove he was the father of Hancock's child. Although Bagwell was victorious, Flair managed to get his blood sample when Bagwell's nemesis Lex Luger attacked him after the match. Bagwell was then revealed as not being the father, and the entire pregnancy was eventually found to have been a fabrication.<ref name=\"Accl3359\"/>\n\n====Totally Buffed (2000\u20132001)====\nAt [[Starrcade (2000)|Starrcade]], Bagwell, who at the time had returned as a backstage interviewer, betrayed [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] by trying to cost him his match with Lex Luger. Bagwell's efforts were unsuccessful, but he managed to hit Goldberg with a steel chair after he had pinned Luger. Despite feuding in the past, Bagwell and Luger united and became known as Totally Buffed. Totally Buffed would go on to defeat Goldberg at [[WCW Sin|Sin]] after a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Plant|fan]] [[Mace (spray)|maced]] Goldberg, allowing Bagwell to pin him. Due to a stipulation in the match, Goldberg was, [[Kayfabe|in storyline]], fired. In early 2001, Totally Buffed joined [[Ric Flair]]'s [[Magnificent Seven (professional wrestling)|Magnificent Seven]] stable, and remained with them until WCW's closure.<ref name=\"Accl3359\"/>\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (2001)===\nShortly after WCW was purchased by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in March 2001, Bagwell was one of the first [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]] contracted wrestlers to accept the offered buy-out on his contract and sign with the WWF.

The match went to a no-contest after interference from [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Kurt Angle]].<ref name=oww/> When Bagwell arrived to the ''Raw'' tapings on July 9 in Atlanta, Georgia, he was informed he was being released from his contract due to complaints about his attitude and an altercation with fellow WCW alumnus [[Gregory Helms|Shane Helms]]. There were also accusations that Bagwell faked an injury at the July 3 ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' tapings after receiving an [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided powerbomb|aided powerbomb]] from the [[Acolytes Protection Agency]]. The accusations also claimed his mother Judy was calling WWF offices to request that her son get time off to heal from an injury supposedly inflicted to Bagwell from the aided powerbomb and to complain about her son's travel arrangements.<ref name=\"Guttman\"/><ref name=\"Accl3359\"/> However, Bagwell himself claims that he never understood why he was fired from the WWF.<ref name=BuffDecemeber>{{cite web|url=http://shiningwizards.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/episode-65-monday-night-wars-with-buff-bagwell-headbanger-thrasher/|title=Episode 65: Monday Night Wars with Buff Bagwell and Headbanger Thrasher|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312124537/http://shiningwizards.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/episode-65-monday-night-wars-with-buff-bagwell-headbanger-thrasher/|archivedate=March 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002, 2003, 2006)===\nAfter making several appearances with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] in 2002 and 2003, Bagwell returned to TNA on the April 27, 2006 episode of ''[[Impact!

{"title_page": "Diaphragm (acoustics)", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=April 2016}}\nIn the field of [[acoustics]], a '''diaphragm''' is a [[transducer]] intended to inter-convert mechanical vibrations to sounds, or vice versa.  It is commonly constructed of a thin membrane or sheet of various materials, suspended at its edges.  The varying air pressure of sound waves imparts mechanical vibrations to the diaphragm which can then be converted to some other type of signal; examples of this type of diaphragm are found in [[microphone]]s and the human [[eardrum]].  Conversely a diaphragm vibrated by a source of energy beats against the air, creating sound waves.  Examples of this type of diaphragm are [[loudspeaker]] cones and [[earphone]] diaphragms and are found in [[air horn]]s.\n\n==Loudspeaker==\nIn a dynamic [[loudspeaker]], a diaphragm is the thin, semi-rigid [[Acoustic membrane|membrane]] attached to the [[voice coil]], which moves in a magnetic gap, vibrating the diaphragm, and producing [[sound]]. It can also be called a '''cone''', though not all speaker diaphragms are cone-shaped.  Diaphragms are also found in [[headphones]].\n\nQuality midrange and bass drivers are usually made from paper, paper composites and laminates, plastic materials such as [[polypropylene]], or mineral/fiber filled polypropylene.  Such materials have very high strength/weight ratios (paper being even higher than metals) and tend to be relatively immune from flexing during large excursions.  This allows the driver to react quickly during transitions in music (i.e. fast changing transient impulses) and minimizes acoustical output distortion.\n\nIf properly designed in terms of mass, stiffness, and damping, paper woofer/midrange cones can outperform many exotic drivers made from more expensive materials. Other materials used for diaphragms include [[polypropylene]] (PP), [[polyetheretherketone]] (PEEK) [[polycarbonate]] (PC), [[Mylar]] (PET), [[silk]], [[glassfibre]], [[carbon fibre]], [[titanium]], [[aluminium]], aluminium-[[magnesium]] alloy, [[nickel]], and [[beryllium]]. A {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} paper woofer with a peak-to-peak excursion of 0.5 inches at 60&nbsp;Hz undergoes a maximum acceleration of 92 \"g\"s.\n\nPaper-based cones account for approximately 85% of the cones sold worldwide. The ability of paper (cellulose) to be easily modified by chemical or mechanical means gives it a practical processing advantage not found in other common cone materials.\n\nThe purpose of the cone/surround assembly is to accurately reproduce the voice coil signal waveform.  Inaccurate reproduction of the voice coil signal results in acoustical distortion.  The ideal for a cone/surround assembly is an extended range of linearity or \"pistonic\" motion characterized by i) minimal acoustical breakup of the cone material, ii) minimal standing wave patterns in the cone, and iii) linearity of the surrounds force-deflection curve.  The cone stiffness/damping plus the surround's linearity/damping play a crucial role in accuracy of the reproduced voice coil signal waveform.  This is the crux of high-fidelity stereo.\n\nThe surround may be resin-treated cloth, resin-treated non-wovens, polymeric foams, or thermoplastic elastomers over-molded onto the cone body.  An ideal surround has a linear force-deflection curve with sufficient damping to fully absorb vibrational transmissions from the cone/surround interface, and the \"toughness\" to withstand long-term vibration-induced fatigue.  Sometimes the conical part and the outer surround are molded in one step and are one piece as commonly used for a [[Guitar speaker]].\n\nOther types of speakers (such as [[electrostatic loudspeakers]]) may use a thin membrane instead of a cone.\n\n==Microphone==\n[[Microphones]] can be thought of as speakers in reverse.  The sound waves strike the thin diaphragm, causing it to vibrate.<ref name=MC1>{{cite web|title=How Microphones Work|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/audio/microphones/how-microphones-work.html|website=Mediacollege.com|publisher=Media College}}</ref> Microphone diaphragms, unlike speaker diaphragms, tend to be thin and flexible, since they need to absorb as much sound as possible.

In a condenser microphone, the diaphragm is placed in front of a plate and is [[electric charge|charged]].<ref name=MC2>{{cite web|title=Condenser|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/audio/microphones/condenser.html|publisher=Media College}}</ref> In a dynamic microphone, the diaphragm is glued to a magnetic coil, similar to the one in a dynamic loudspeaker. (In fact, a dynamic speaker can be used as a rudimentary microphone, and vice versa.)<ref name=MC3>{{cite web|title=Dynamic Microphone|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/audio/microphones/dynamic.html}}</ref>\n\nThe diaphragm in a microphone works similarly to the human [[eardrum]].\n\n==Other uses==\nIn a [[phonograph]] reproducer, the diaphragm is a flat disk of typically [[mica]] or [[isinglass]] that converts the mechanical vibration imparted on the buttress from the recorded groove into sound.  In the case of [[Acoustic_recording#Acoustic_recording|acoustic recording]] the reproducer converts the sound into the motion of the needle that scribes the groove on the recording media.\n\n==See also==\n[[Acoustic membrane]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Acoustics]]\n[[Category:Loudspeakers]]\n", "name_user": "81.105.215.176", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragm_(acoustics)"}

These were fed into the machine, and the corresponding amount debited from the customer's account.\n\nA Chubb-made ATM appeared in [[Sydney]] in 1969. This was the first ATM installed in [[Australia]].

On-premises ATMs are typically more advanced, multi-function machines that complement a bank branch's capabilities, and are thus more expensive.

Some examples of interbank networks include [[NYCE]], [[Pulse (interbank network)|PULSE]], [[Plus (interbank network)|PLUS]], [[Cirrus (interbank network)|Cirrus]], [[AFFN]], [[Interac]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interac.ca/en/interac-cash-consumer.html|title=Interac Cash web page|author=<!--Not stated-->|access-date=July 2, 2018}}</ref> Interswitch, [[STAR (interbank network)|STAR]], [[LINK (UK)|LINK]], [[MegaLink]], and [[BancNet]].\n\nATMs rely on authorization of a [[financial transaction]] by the card issuer or other authorizing institution on a communications network. This is often performed through an [[ISO 8583]] messaging system.\n\nMany banks charge [[ATM usage fees]]. In some cases, these fees are charged solely to users who are not customers of the bank that operates the ATM; in other cases, they apply to all users.\n\nIn order to allow a more diverse range of devices to attach to their networks, some interbank networks have passed rules expanding the definition of an ATM to be a terminal that either has the vault within its footprint or utilises the vault or cash drawer within the merchant establishment, which allows for the use of a [[scrip cash dispenser]].\n\n[[File:Diebold 1063 ATM with modem.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Diebold 1063]]ix with a dial-up modem visible at the base]]\n\nATMs typically connect directly to their host or [[ATMC|ATM Controller]] on either [[ADSL]] or dial-up [[modem]] over a [[telephone]] line or directly on a leased line. Leased lines are preferable to [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) lines because they require less time to establish a connection. Less-trafficked machines will usually rely on a dial-up modem on a POTS line rather than using a leased line, since a leased line may be comparatively more expensive to operate compared to a POTS line. That dilemma may be solved as high-speed Internet [[VPN]] connections become more ubiquitous. Common lower-level layer communication protocols used by ATMs to communicate back to the bank include [[Systems Network Architecture|SNA]] over [[Synchronous Data Link Control|SDLC]], [[TC500]] over [[Asynchronous communication|Async]], [[X.25]], and [[TCP/IP]] over [[Ethernet]].\n\nIn addition to methods employed for transaction security and secrecy, all communications traffic between the ATM and the Transaction Processor may also be encrypted using methods such as [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]].<ref>[http://www.ebcvg.com/press.php?id=794] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073750/http://www.ebcvg.com/press.php?id=794|date=16 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Global use ==\n[[File:HSBC Express Banking in Shatin 2017.jpg|thumb|HSBC Express Banking ATM in, [[Shatin]], [[Hong Kong]]]]\n[[File:ATM machines in Siam Paragon.jpg|thumb|Assortment of ATMs in [[Siam Paragon]] shopping centre, [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]]]\n\nThere are no hard international or government-compiled numbers totaling the complete number of ATMs in use worldwide.

Indian-based [[Vortex Engineering]] is manufacturing ATMs which operate only with Linux.\nCommon application layer transaction protocols, such as [[Diebold]] 91x (911 or 912) and [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] [[NCR Corporation|NDC or NDC+]] provide [[Hardware emulation|emulation]] of older generations of hardware on newer platforms with incremental extensions made over time to address new capabilities, although companies like NCR continuously improve these protocols issuing newer versions (e.g. NCR's AANDC v3.x.y, where x.y are subversions). Most major ATM manufacturers provide software packages that implement these protocols. Newer protocols such as IFX have yet to find wide acceptance by transaction processors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=1252 |title=Messaging standard to give multiple channels a common language |publisher=selfserviceworld.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329032543/http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=1252 |archivedate=29 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nWith the move to a more standardised software base, financial institutions have been increasingly interested in the ability to pick and choose the application programs that drive their equipment. [[WOSA/XFS]], now known as [[CEN/XFS|CEN XFS (or simply XFS)]], provides a common [[API]] for accessing and manipulating the various devices of an ATM. [[J/XFS]] is a Java implementation of the CEN XFS API.\n\nWhile the perceived benefit of XFS is similar to the Java's \"[[write once, run anywhere]]\" mantra, often different ATM hardware vendors have different interpretations of the XFS standard. The result of these differences in interpretation means that ATM applications typically use a [[middleware]] to even out the differences among various platforms.\n\nWith the onset of Windows operating systems and XFS on ATMs, the software applications have the ability to become more intelligent. This has created a new breed of ATM applications commonly referred to as programmable applications. These types of applications allows for an entirely new host of applications in which the ATM terminal can do more than only communicate with the ATM switch. It is now empowered to connected to other content servers and [[video banking]] systems.\n\nNotable ATM software that operates on XFS platforms include Triton PRISM, [[Diebold]] Agilis EmPower, [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] [[NCR Corporation|APTRA Edge]], [[Absolute Systems]] AbsoluteINTERACT, [[KAL (Korala Associates Limited)|KAL]] [[KAL (Korala Associates Limited)|Kalignite Software Platform]], Phoenix Interactive VISTAatm, [[Wincor Nixdorf]] [[Wincor Nixdorf|ProTopas]], [[Euronet Worldwide|Euronet]] EFTS and Intertech inter-ATM.\n\nWith the move of ATMs to industry-standard computing environments, concern has risen about the integrity of the ATM's software stack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/32350.html |title=Technology News: Security: Windows Cash-Machine Worm Generates Concern |publisher=Technewsworld.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318100752/http://www.technewsworld.com/story/32350.html |archivedate=18 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Impact on labor ==\nThe number of human [[bank teller]]s in the United States increased from approximately 300,000 in 1970 to approximately 600,000 in 2010. Counter-intuitively, a contributing factor may be the introduction of automated teller machines. ATMs let a branch operate with fewer tellers, making it cheaper for banks to open more branches. This likely resulted in more tellers being hired to handle non-automated tasks, but further automation and [[online banking]] may reverse this increase.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.recode.net/2017/5/8/15584268/eric-schmidt-alphabet-automation-atm-bank-teller |title=Eric Schmidt said ATMs led to more jobs for bank tellers.

To avoid this, the schedule for filling them is kept secret, varying and random. The money is often kept in cassettes, which will dye the money if incorrectly opened.\n\n=== Transactional secrecy and integrity ===\n\nThe security of ATM transactions relies mostly on the integrity of the secure [[cryptoprocessor]]: the ATM often uses general commodity components that sometimes are not considered to be \"[[trusted system]]s\".\n\nEncryption of personal information, required by law in many jurisdictions, is used to prevent fraud. Sensitive data in ATM transactions are usually [[encryption|encrypted]] with [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], but transaction processors now usually require the use of [[Triple DES]].<ref>[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=25059&pavilion=126&step=story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012175105/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=25059&pavilion=126&step=story|date=12 October 2006}}</ref> Remote Key Loading techniques may be used to ensure the secrecy of the initialisation of the encryption keys in the ATM.

Alarm sensors are placed inside ATMs and their servicing areas to alert their operators when doors have been opened by unauthorised personnel.\n\nTo protect against hackers, ATMs have a built-in firewall. Once the firewall has detected malicious attempts to break into the machine remotely, the firewall locks down the machine.\n\nRules are usually set by the government or ATM operating body that dictate what happens when integrity systems fail. Depending on the jurisdiction, a bank may or may not be liable when an attempt is made to dispense a customer's money from an ATM and the money either gets outside of the ATM's vault, or was exposed in a non-secure fashion, or they are unable to determine the state of the money after a failed transaction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kuluttajavirasto.fi/user_nf/default_mag.asp?id=12263&lmf=11440&mode=readdoc&tmf=11440|title=Kilpailu- ja kuluttajavirasto}}</ref> Customers often commented that it is difficult to recover money lost in this way, but this is often complicated by the policies regarding suspicious activities typical of the criminal element.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Banking/P57803.asp |title=Banking |publisher=Moneycentral.msn.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417111312/http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Banking/P57803.asp |archivedate=17 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Customer security ===\n[[File:ATMs In A Van.jpg|thumb|left|Dunbar armored personnel watching over ATMs that have been installed in a [[van]]]]\n\nIn some countries, multiple [[security camera]]s and [[security guard]]s are a common feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.banking.state.ny.us/legal/atmsafe.htm |title=NYSBD - Text of the ATM Safety Act |publisher=Banking.state.ny.us |date=1997-06-01 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410044556/http://www.banking.state.ny.us/legal/atmsafe.htm |archivedate=10 April 2011 }} \n</ref> In the [[United States]], The [[New York State]] Comptroller's Office has advised the New York State Department of Banking to have more thorough safety inspections of ATMs in high crime areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/oct07/100407.htm |title=DiNapoli Calls for Better Oversight of Bank ATMs |publisher=Osc.state.ny.us |date=2007-10-04 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610044250/http://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/oct07/100407.htm |archivedate=10 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\nConsultants of ATM operators assert that the issue of customer security should have more focus by the banking industry;<ref>[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=5171&pavilion=4&step=story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509230352/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=5171&pavilion=4&step=story|date=9 May 2006}}</ref> it has been suggested that efforts are now more concentrated on the preventive measure of deterrent legislation than on the problem of ongoing forced withdrawals.<ref>[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news_story.htm?i=20479] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509230332/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news_story.htm?i=20479|date=9 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nAt least as far back as July 30, 1986, consultants of the industry have advised for the adoption of an emergency PIN system for ATMs, where the user is able to send a [[panic alarm|silent alarm]] in response to a threat.<ref>Representative Mario Biaggi, Congressional Record, July 30, 1986, Page 18232 et seq.</ref> Legislative efforts to require an emergency PIN system have appeared in [[Illinois]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.obre.state.il.us/AGENCY/News/atmrpt.htm |title=ATM Report |publisher=Obre.state.il.us |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104220104/http://www.obre.state.il.us/AGENCY/News/atmrpt.htm |archivedate=4 November 2010 }}</ref> [[Kansas]]<ref>[http://www.cunews.com/newsletters/2004216.htm Credit Union tech-talk news and technology resource] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073753/https://www.cunews.com/newsletters/2004216.htm |date=16 October 2015 }}.

In the wake of a homicide in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, the city council passed an ATM security bill as well.\n\nIn China and elsewhere, many efforts to promote security have been made. On-premises ATMs are often located inside the bank's lobby, which may be accessible 24 hours a day. These lobbies have extensive security camera coverage, a courtesy telephone for consulting with the bank staff, and a security guard on the premises. Bank lobbies that are not guarded 24 hours a day may also have secure doors that can only be opened from outside by swiping the bank card against a wall-mounted scanner, allowing the bank to identify which card enters the building. Most ATMs will also display on-screen safety warnings and may also be fitted with convex mirrors above the display allowing the user to see what is happening behind them.\n\nAs of 2013, the only claim available about the extent of ATM-connected homicides is that they range from 500 to 1,000 per year in the US, covering only cases where the victim had an ATM card and the card was used by the killer after the known time of death.<ref>[http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Could_Reverse_Pin_Save_Lives_at_ATM_152336195.html Could Reverse PIN Save Lives at ATM?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013150036/http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Could_Reverse_Pin_Save_Lives_at_ATM_152336195.html |date=13 October 2014 }}.

Fraud against ATMs and people's attempts to use them takes several forms.\n\nThe first known instance of a fake ATM was installed at a shopping mall in [[Manchester, Connecticut]] in 1993. By modifying the inner workings of a [[Fujitsu]] model 7020 ATM, a criminal gang known as the Bucklands Boys stole information from cards inserted into the machine by customers.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/atm_pr.html |title=1.05: The Bucklands Boys and Other Tales of the ATM |journal=Wired |accessdate=2011-02-11 |first=Phil |last=Patton |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029073146/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/atm_pr.html |archivedate=29 October 2010 |df=dmy-all |date=May 1993 }}</ref>\n\n[[WAVY-TV]] reported an incident in Virginia Beach in September 2006 where a hacker, who had probably obtained a factory-default administrator password for a filling station's white-label ATM, caused the unit to assume it was loaded with US$5 bills instead of $20s, enabling himself\u2014and many subsequent customers\u2014to walk away with four times the money withdrawn from their accounts.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html?url=/video/tech/2006/09/14/owens.va.atm.scam.wavy |title=Video |publisher=Cnn.com |date=2005-06-06 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109222545/http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html?url=%2Fvideo%2Ftech%2F2006%2F09%2F14%2Fowens.va.atm.scam.wavy |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This type of scam was featured on the TV series ''[[The Real Hustle]]''.\n\nATM behaviour can change during what is called \"stand-in\" time, where the bank's cash dispensing network is unable to access databases that contain account information (possibly for database maintenance). In order to give customers access to cash, customers may be allowed to withdraw cash up to a certain amount that may be less than their usual daily withdrawal limit, but may still exceed the amount of available money in their accounts, which could result in fraud if the customers intentionally withdraw more money than what they had in their accounts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/4.html |title=Kennison v Daire [1986&#93; HCA 4; (1986) 160 CLR 129 (20 February 1986) |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date=1986-02-20 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Card fraud ===\nIn an attempt to prevent criminals from [[shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]] the customer's [[personal identification number]] (PIN), some banks draw privacy areas on the floor.\n\nFor a low-tech form of fraud, the easiest is to simply steal a customer's card along with its PIN. A later variant of this approach is to trap the card inside of the ATM's card reader with a device often referred to as a [[Lebanese loop]]. When the customer gets frustrated by not getting the card back and walks away from the machine, the criminal is able to remove the card and withdraw cash from the customer's account, using the card and its PIN.\n\nThis type of fraud has spread globally. Although somewhat replaced in terms of volume by skimming incidents, a re-emergence of card trapping has been noticed in regions such as Europe, where EMV chip and PIN cards have increased in circulation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atmsecurity.com/articles/atm-fraud/atm-security-issues-atm-fraud-issues-by-geography.html |title=ATM Security Issues & ATM Fraud Issues by Geography &#124; ATMSecurity.com ATM Security news ATM Security issues ATM fraud info ATM |publisher=Atmsecurity.com |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024215333/http://www.atmsecurity.com/articles/atm-fraud/atm-security-issues-atm-fraud-issues-by-geography.html |archivedate=24 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAnother simple form of fraud involves attempting to get the customer's bank to issue a new card and its PIN and stealing them from their mail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/phracks/phrack-08 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724213440/http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/phracks/phrack-08 |archivedate=24 July 2008 }} \n</ref>\n\nBy contrast, a newer high-tech method of operating, sometimes called '''card skimming''' or '''card cloning''', involves the installation of a magnetic card reader over the real ATM's card slot and the use of a wireless surveillance camera or a modified digital camera or a false PIN keypad to observe the user's PIN. Card data is then cloned into a duplicate card and the criminal attempts a standard cash withdrawal. The availability of low-cost commodity wireless cameras, keypads, card readers, and card writers has made it a relatively simple form of fraud, with comparatively low risk to the fraudsters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/warnings/atmcamera.asp|title=Skimming with ATM Cameras : snopes.com|author=snopes|date=29 March 2016|work=snopes}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to stop these practices, countermeasures against card cloning have been developed by the banking industry, in particular by the use of [[smart card]]s which cannot easily be copied or spoofed by unauthenticated devices, and by attempting to make the outside of their ATMs [[tamper-evident|tamper evident]].

This signature, known as a \"MagnePrint\" or \"BluPrint\", can be used in conjunction with common two-factor authentication schemes used in ATM, debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.\n\nThe concept and various methods of copying the contents of an ATM card's magnetic stripe onto a duplicate card to access other people's financial information was well known in the hacking communities by late 1990.<ref>{{cite web |author=Fredric L.

They used principles including [[radiation|Carbon-14]] and low-coercivity [[magnetism]] in order to make fraud more difficult.\n\n[[File:\u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442 \u0421\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sberbank of Russia|Sberbank]] ATM in [[Tolyatti]], [[Russia]]]]\n\nThe idea of a [[Personal identification number|PIN]] stored on the card was developed by a group of engineers working at [[Smiths Group]] on the Chubb MD2 in 1965 and which has been credited to [[James Goodfellow]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013n554|title=James Goodfellow, Series 2, Pioneers - BBC Radio 4 Extra|author=|date=|website=BBC|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> (patent GB1197183 filed on 2 May 1966 with Anthony Davies).

This patent is also the earliest instance of a complete \"currency dispenser system\" in the patent record. This patent was filed on 5 March 1968 in the US (US 3543904) and granted on 1 December 1970. It had a profound influence on the industry as a whole.

For example, given its link with [[Barclays]],  [[Bank of Scotland]] deployed a DACS in 1968 under the  [http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/our-group/our-heritage/timeline/1951-1990/ 'Scotcash'] brand. Customers were given personal code numbers to activate the machines, similar to the modern PIN. They were also supplied with \u00a310 vouchers. These were fed into the machine, and the corresponding amount debited from the customer's account.\n\nA Chubb-made ATM appeared in [[Sydney]] in 1969. This was the first ATM installed in [[Australia]]. The machine only dispensed $25 at a time and the bank card itself would be mailed to the user after the bank had processed the withdrawal.\n\n[[File:ABC ATMs.ogv|thumb|1969 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news report on the introduction of ATMs in [[Sydney, Australia]].

In some cases, these fees are charged solely to users who are not customers of the bank that operates the ATM; in other cases, they apply to all users.\n\nIn order to allow a more diverse range of devices to attach to their networks, some interbank networks have passed rules expanding the definition of an ATM to be a terminal that either has the vault within its footprint or utilises the vault or cash drawer within the merchant establishment, which allows for the use of a [[scrip cash dispenser]].\n\n[[File:Diebold 1063 ATM with modem.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Diebold 1063]]ix with a dial-up modem visible at the base]]\n\nATMs typically connect directly to their host or [[ATMC|ATM Controller]] on either [[ADSL]] or dial-up [[modem]] over a [[telephone]] line or directly on a leased line. Leased lines are preferable to [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) lines because they require less time to establish a connection. Less-trafficked machines will usually rely on a dial-up modem on a POTS line rather than using a leased line, since a leased line may be comparatively more expensive to operate compared to a POTS line. That dilemma may be solved as high-speed Internet [[VPN]] connections become more ubiquitous.

[[WOSA/XFS]], now known as [[CEN/XFS|CEN XFS (or simply XFS)]], provides a common [[API]] for accessing and manipulating the various devices of an ATM. [[J/XFS]] is a Java implementation of the CEN XFS API.\n\nWhile the perceived benefit of XFS is similar to the Java's \"[[write once, run anywhere]]\" mantra, often different ATM hardware vendors have different interpretations of the XFS standard. The result of these differences in interpretation means that ATM applications typically use a [[middleware]] to even out the differences among various platforms.\n\nWith the onset of Windows operating systems and XFS on ATMs, the software applications have the ability to become more intelligent. This has created a new breed of ATM applications commonly referred to as programmable applications. These types of applications allows for an entirely new host of applications in which the ATM terminal can do more than only communicate with the ATM switch.

Depending on the jurisdiction, a bank may or may not be liable when an attempt is made to dispense a customer's money from an ATM and the money either gets outside of the ATM's vault, or was exposed in a non-secure fashion, or they are unable to determine the state of the money after a failed transaction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kuluttajavirasto.fi/user_nf/default_mag.asp?id=12263&lmf=11440&mode=readdoc&tmf=11440|title=Kilpailu- ja kuluttajavirasto}}</ref> Customers often commented that it is difficult to recover money lost in this way, but this is often complicated by the policies regarding suspicious activities typical of the criminal element.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Banking/P57803.asp |title=Banking |publisher=Moneycentral.msn.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417111312/http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Banking/P57803.asp |archivedate=17 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Customer security ===\n[[File:ATMs In A Van.jpg|thumb|left|Dunbar armored personnel watching over ATMs that have been installed in a [[van]]]]\n\nIn some countries, multiple [[security camera]]s and [[security guard]]s are a common feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.banking.state.ny.us/legal/atmsafe.htm |title=NYSBD - Text of the ATM Safety Act |publisher=Banking.state.ny.us |date=1997-06-01 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410044556/http://www.banking.state.ny.us/legal/atmsafe.htm |archivedate=10 April 2011 }} \n</ref> In the [[United States]], The [[New York State]] Comptroller's Office has advised the New York State Department of Banking to have more thorough safety inspections of ATMs in high crime areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/oct07/100407.htm |title=DiNapoli Calls for Better Oversight of Bank ATMs |publisher=Osc.state.ny.us |date=2007-10-04 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610044250/http://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/oct07/100407.htm |archivedate=10 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\nConsultants of ATM operators assert that the issue of customer security should have more focus by the banking industry;<ref>[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=5171&pavilion=4&step=story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509230352/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=5171&pavilion=4&step=story|date=9 May 2006}}</ref> it has been suggested that efforts are now more concentrated on the preventive measure of deterrent legislation than on the problem of ongoing forced withdrawals.<ref>[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news_story.htm?i=20479] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509230332/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news_story.htm?i=20479|date=9 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nAt least as far back as July 30, 1986, consultants of the industry have advised for the adoption of an emergency PIN system for ATMs, where the user is able to send a [[panic alarm|silent alarm]] in response to a threat.<ref>Representative Mario Biaggi, Congressional Record, July 30, 1986, Page 18232 et seq.</ref> Legislative efforts to require an emergency PIN system have appeared in [[Illinois]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.obre.state.il.us/AGENCY/News/atmrpt.htm |title=ATM Report |publisher=Obre.state.il.us |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104220104/http://www.obre.state.il.us/AGENCY/News/atmrpt.htm |archivedate=4 November 2010 }}</ref> [[Kansas]]<ref>[http://www.cunews.com/newsletters/2004216.htm Credit Union tech-talk news and technology resource] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073753/https://www.cunews.com/newsletters/2004216.htm |date=16 October 2015 }}.

In the wake of a homicide in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, the city council passed an ATM security bill as well.\n\nIn China and elsewhere, many efforts to promote security have been made. On-premises ATMs are often located inside the bank's lobby, which may be accessible 24 hours a day. These lobbies have extensive security camera coverage, a courtesy telephone for consulting with the bank staff, and a security guard on the premises. Bank lobbies that are not guarded 24 hours a day may also have secure doors that can only be opened from outside by swiping the bank card against a wall-mounted scanner, allowing the bank to identify which card enters the building. Most ATMs will also display on-screen safety warnings and may also be fitted with convex mirrors above the display allowing the user to see what is happening behind them.\n\nAs of 2013, the only claim available about the extent of ATM-connected homicides is that they range from 500 to 1,000 per year in the US, covering only cases where the victim had an ATM card and the card was used by the killer after the known time of death.<ref>[http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Could_Reverse_Pin_Save_Lives_at_ATM_152336195.html Could Reverse PIN Save Lives at ATM?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013150036/http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Could_Reverse_Pin_Save_Lives_at_ATM_152336195.html |date=13 October 2014 }}.

Fraud against ATMs and people's attempts to use them takes several forms.\n\nThe first known instance of a fake ATM was installed at a shopping mall in [[Manchester, Connecticut]] in 1993. By modifying the inner workings of a [[Fujitsu]] model 7020 ATM, a criminal gang known as the Bucklands Boys stole information from cards inserted into the machine by customers.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/atm_pr.html |title=1.05: The Bucklands Boys and Other Tales of the ATM |journal=Wired |accessdate=2011-02-11 |first=Phil |last=Patton |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029073146/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/atm_pr.html |archivedate=29 October 2010 |df=dmy-all |date=May 1993 }}</ref>\n\n[[WAVY-TV]] reported an incident in Virginia Beach in September 2006 where a hacker, who had probably obtained a factory-default administrator password for a filling station's white-label ATM, caused the unit to assume it was loaded with US$5 bills instead of $20s, enabling himself\u2014and many subsequent customers\u2014to walk away with four times the money withdrawn from their accounts.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html?url=/video/tech/2006/09/14/owens.va.atm.scam.wavy |title=Video |publisher=Cnn.com |date=2005-06-06 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109222545/http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html?url=%2Fvideo%2Ftech%2F2006%2F09%2F14%2Fowens.va.atm.scam.wavy |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This type of scam was featured on the TV series ''[[The Real Hustle]]''.\n\nATM behaviour can change during what is called \"stand-in\" time, where the bank's cash dispensing network is unable to access databases that contain account information (possibly for database maintenance). In order to give customers access to cash, customers may be allowed to withdraw cash up to a certain amount that may be less than their usual daily withdrawal limit, but may still exceed the amount of available money in their accounts, which could result in fraud if the customers intentionally withdraw more money than what they had in their accounts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/4.html |title=Kennison v Daire [1986&#93; HCA 4; (1986) 160 CLR 129 (20 February 1986) |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date=1986-02-20 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Card fraud ===\nIn an attempt to prevent criminals from [[shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]] the customer's [[personal identification number]] (PIN), some banks draw privacy areas on the floor.\n\nFor a low-tech form of fraud, the easiest is to simply steal a customer's card along with its PIN. A later variant of this approach is to trap the card inside of the ATM's card reader with a device often referred to as a [[Lebanese loop]]. When the customer gets frustrated by not getting the card back and walks away from the machine, the criminal is able to remove the card and withdraw cash from the customer's account, using the card and its PIN.\n\nThis type of fraud has spread globally. Although somewhat replaced in terms of volume by skimming incidents, a re-emergence of card trapping has been noticed in regions such as Europe, where EMV chip and PIN cards have increased in circulation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atmsecurity.com/articles/atm-fraud/atm-security-issues-atm-fraud-issues-by-geography.html |title=ATM Security Issues & ATM Fraud Issues by Geography &#124; ATMSecurity.com ATM Security news ATM Security issues ATM fraud info ATM |publisher=Atmsecurity.com |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024215333/http://www.atmsecurity.com/articles/atm-fraud/atm-security-issues-atm-fraud-issues-by-geography.html |archivedate=24 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAnother simple form of fraud involves attempting to get the customer's bank to issue a new card and its PIN and stealing them from their mail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/phracks/phrack-08 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724213440/http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/phracks/phrack-08 |archivedate=24 July 2008 }} \n</ref>\n\nBy contrast, a newer high-tech method of operating, sometimes called '''card skimming''' or '''card cloning''', involves the installation of a magnetic card reader over the real ATM's card slot and the use of a wireless surveillance camera or a modified digital camera or a false PIN keypad to observe the user's PIN. Card data is then cloned into a duplicate card and the criminal attempts a standard cash withdrawal. The availability of low-cost commodity wireless cameras, keypads, card readers, and card writers has made it a relatively simple form of fraud, with comparatively low risk to the fraudsters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/warnings/atmcamera.asp|title=Skimming with ATM Cameras : snopes.com|author=snopes|date=29 March 2016|work=snopes}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to stop these practices, countermeasures against card cloning have been developed by the banking industry, in particular by the use of [[smart card]]s which cannot easily be copied or spoofed by unauthenticated devices, and by attempting to make the outside of their ATMs [[tamper-evident|tamper evident]].

This signature, known as a \"MagnePrint\" or \"BluPrint\", can be used in conjunction with common two-factor authentication schemes used in ATM, debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.\n\nThe concept and various methods of copying the contents of an ATM card's magnetic stripe onto a duplicate card to access other people's financial information was well known in the hacking communities by late 1990.<ref>{{cite web |author=Fredric L.
