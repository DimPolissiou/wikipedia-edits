Found in south-eastern Guatemala to northern Colombia and north-western Venezuela\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Keel-billed toucan, costa rica.jpg|thumb|left|Keel-billed toucan in Las Pumas Zoo, [[Costa Rica]]]]\nIncluding its bill, the keel-billed toucan ranges in length from around {{convert|42|to|55|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Skutch1971/> Their large and colorful bill averages around {{convert|12|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}, about one-third of its length. It typically weighs about {{convert|380|-|500|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name=anywherecostarica/> While the bill seems large and cumbersome, it is in fact a spongy, hollow bone covered in [[keratin]], a very light and hard protein.\n\nThe [[feather|plumage]] of the keel-billed toucan is mainly black with a yellow neck and chest. [[Moult|Molting]] occurs once per year.<ref name=vantyne1929/> It has blue feet and red feathers at the tip of its tail. The bill is mainly green with a red tip and orange sides.\n\nKeel-billed toucans have [[Zygodactyl#Zygodactyly|zygodactyl feet]] (or feet with toes facing in different directions) \u2013 two toes face forward and two face back. Because toucans spend a large portion of time in the trees, this helps the birds to stay on the branches of the trees and jump from one branch to another.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe keel-billed toucan can be found from Southern Mexico to Venezuela and Colombia. It roosts in the [[Canopy (forest)|canopies]] of tropical, subtropical, and lowland rainforests, up to altitudes of {{convert|1900|m|ft|abbr = on}}.<ref name=StreweNavarro2004/> It roosts in holes in trees,<ref name=vantyne1929/> often with several other toucans. This can be very cramped, so the birds tuck their tails and beaks under their bodies to conserve space while sleeping. Adding to the lack of space, the bottoms of the holes are often covered with pits from the fruit the toucans have eaten.<ref name=vantyne1929/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nLike many toucans, keel-billed toucans are very social birds, rarely seen alone. They fly in small [[Herd|flocks]] of approximately six to twelve individuals through lowland [[rainforest]]s. Their flight is slow and undulating, consisting of rapid wing beats (six to ten), then a glide with the bird's beak extending forward and dipping downward as though pulling the rest of the bird.<ref name=vantyne1929/> Their feet are drawn up forward in flight. The flight distances are typically short.<ref name=vantyne1929/> They live together in groups, often sharing cramped living quarters of holes in trees. There is a family structure within the group. Birds often \"duel\" with each other using their bills, and throw fruit into each other's mouths. They 'play ball', one throwing a fruit in the air and a second seizing it.<ref name=vantyne1929/>\n[[File:Keel-billed Toucan (16201157519).jpg|thumb|Keel-billed toucan in Costa Rica]]\n\n===Breeding===\nThe female keel-billed toucan will lay 1\u20134 white eggs in a natural or already-made tree cavity.<ref name=saczoo/> The male and female share in the caring of the eggs, both taking turns incubating.<ref name=vantyne1929/> The eggs hatch approximately 15\u201320 days after being laid. After hatching, the male and female again take turns feeding the chicks. When the chicks hatch, they have no feathers, and have their eyes closed for approximately 3 weeks. The chicks have adequately formed heel pads, which assist on the pit-covered bottom of the nest.<ref name=vantyne1929/> The chicks stay in their nest for approximately eight to nine weeks while their bills develop fully and they are ready to fledge from the nest.\n\n===Food and feeding===\nThe diet of keel-billed toucans consists mostly of a wide range of fruit,{{refn|name=notes|E.g. ''[[Cymbopetalum mayanum]]'' ([[Annonaceae]]) and [[gumbo-limbo]] (''Bursera simaruba'')<ref name=vantyne1929/><ref name=Foster2007/>}} but may also include insects, eggs, [[nestling]]s and lizards. The bill, surprisingly dexterous, allows this toucan to utilize a large variety of fruit that might not otherwise be reached. When eating the fruit, it uses its bill to dissect the fruit, and then tosses its head back to swallow the fruit whole.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Ramphastos sulfuratus -London Zoo-4c.jpg|At [[London

sensitive to [[hemochromatosis]] (an iron storage disease).<ref name=Otten2001/>\n\n==Status==\nAble to utilize human-altered [[habitat]] to some extent,<ref name=Foster2007/> this widespread bird is considered to be a Species of Least Concern by the [[IUCN]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, they are still threatened by hunting for their meat and beaks, and toucan populations are on a decreasing

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with [[Amnesty International]] and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.<ref

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Chhang Dawa Sherpa and his brother Mingma Sherpa attained the [[Guinness world record]] of  \"World's First Siblings (Brothers)\" to successfully summit the fourteen mountains of the world which are over 8000 meters in height.\n\n==8000m Mountains Summit By Chhang Dawa Sherpa==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!width=\"50\"|'''S.NO'''\n!width=\"150\"|'''Name of Mountain'''\n!width=\"100\"|'''Year'''\n!width=\"100\"|'''Season'''\n!width=\"100\"|'''Height(M)'''\n!width=\"100\"|'''Country'''\n\n|-\n| 1\n| Makalu\n| 2001\n| Spring\n| 8463\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 2\n| Lhotse\n| 2002\n| Spring\n| 8516\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 3\n| Cho-Oyu\n| 2002\n| Autumn\n| 8201\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 4\n| Mount Everest\n| 2003\n| Spring\n| 8848\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 5\n| Mount Everest\n| 2004\n| Spring\n| 8848\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 6\n| Mount Everest\n| 2005\n| Spring\n| 8848\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 7\n| Makalu\n| 2008\n| Spring\n| 8463\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 8\n| Broad Peak\n| 2008\n| Summer\n| 8047\n| Pakistan\n|-\n| 9\n| Dhami Khang\n| 2009\n| Spring\n| 7264\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 10\n| Nanga Parbat\n| 2010\n| Summer\n| 8125\n| Pakistan\n|-\n| 11\n| G-I\n| 2010\n| Summer\n| 8068\n| Pakistan\n|-\n| 12\n| Manaslu\n| 2010\n| Autumn\n| 8163\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 13\n| Langtang Lirung\n| 2010\n| Autumn\n| 7234\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 14\n| Kanchanjunga\n| 2011\n| Spring\n| 8586\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 15\n| G-I\n| 2011\n| Summer\n| 8068\n| Pakistan\n|-\n| 16\n| G-II\n| 2011\n| Summer\n| 8035\n| Pakistan\n|-\n| 17\n| Manaslu\n| 2011\n| Autumn\n| 8163\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 18\n| Annapurna I\n| 2012\n| Spring\n| 8091\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 19\n| Dhaulagiri I\n| 2012\n| Spring\n| 8167\n| Nepal\n|-\n| 20\n| K-2\n| 2012\n| Summer\n| 8611\n| Pakistan\n|-\n| 21\n| Shisha Pangma\n| 2013\n| Spring\n| 8027\n| China\n|-\n| 22\n| Dhaulagiri I\n| 2014\n| Spring\n| 8167\n| Nepal\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Mount Everest summiters by number of times to the summit]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sherpa, Chhang Dawa}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1982 births]]\n[[Category:Sherpa summiters of Mount Everest]]\n[[Category:People from Sankhuwasabha District]]\n[[Category:Nepalese summiters of Mount Everest]]\n", "name_user": "MB", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix infobox image syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhang_Dawa_Sherpa"}

True fish are also referred to as ''finfish'' or ''fin fish'' to distinguish them from other [[aquatic life]] harvested in fisheries or aquaculture.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Faina de Pesca,Sesimbra.jpg|thumb|right|Fishermen in [[Sesimbra]], Portugal]]\nFisheries are harvested for their value ([[Commercial fishing|commercial]], [[Recreational fishing|recreational]] or [[Artisan fishing|subsistence]]). They can be [[Seawater|saltwater]] or [[freshwater]], [[Wildlife|wild]] or [[farmed]]. Examples are the [[salmon]] fishery of [[Alaska]], the [[Atlantic cod|cod]] fishery off the [[Lofoten]] islands, the [[tuna]] fishery of the [[Pacific Ocean|Eastern Pacific]], or the [[shrimp farm]] fisheries in [[China]]. Capture fisheries can be broadly classified as industrial scale, small-scale or artisanal, and recreational.\n\nClose to 90% of the world's fishery catches come from [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s, as opposed to inland waters. These marine catches have remained relatively stable since the mid-nineties (between 80 and 86 million tonnes).<ref>{{cite web | title=Scientific Facts on Fisheries| publisher=GreenFacts Website | date=2009-03-02 | accessdate=2009-03-25 | url= http://www.greenfacts.org/en/fisheries/index.htm\n}}</ref> Most marine fisheries are based near the [[coast]]. This is not only because harvesting from relatively shallow waters is easier than in the open ocean, but also because fish are much more abundant near the [[coast|coastal shelf]], due to the abundance of [[nutrient]]s available there from [[upwelling|coastal upwelling]] and [[land runoff]]. However, productive wild fisheries also exist in open oceans, particularly by [[seamount]]s, and inland in lakes and rivers.\n\nMost fisheries are [[wild fisheries]], but [[Fish farm|farmed fisheries]] are increasing. Farming can occur in coastal areas, such as with [[Oyster farming|oyster farms]],<ref>New Zealand Seafood Industry Council. [http://www.seafood.co.nz/musselfarming ''Mussel Farming.'']</ref> but more typically occur inland, in lakes, ponds, tanks and other enclosures.\n\nThere are species fisheries worldwide for finfish, [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s and [[echinoderm]]s, and by extension, [[aquatic plant]]s such as [[kelp]]. However, a very small number of species support the majority of the world's fisheries. Some of these species are [[herring]], [[cod]], [[anchovy]], tuna, [[flounder]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[squid]], [[shrimp]], salmon, [[crab]], [[lobster]], [[oyster]] and [[scallop]]s. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a [[million]] [[tonne]]s in 1999, with herring and [[sardine]]s together providing a harvest of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species are harvested in smaller numbers.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Global capture fisheries and aquaculture production, 1990-2030.svg|thumb|right|Global capture fisheries and aquaculture production reported by FAO, 1990-2030]]\n\nTotal fish production in 2016 reached an all-time high of 171 million tonnes, of which 88 percent was utilized for direct human consumption, thanks to relatively stable capture fisheries production, reduced wastage and continued aquaculture growth.

Roberts, Allan L. Larson: ''Integrated Principles of Zoology'', McGraw-Hill Publishing Co, 2001, {{ISBN|0-07-290961-7}}</ref>\n* '''In fisheries''' \u2013 the term ''fish'' is used as a collective term, and includes [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s and any [[aquatic animal]] which is harvested.<ref name=\"FAO-Glossary\" />\n* '''True fish''' \u2013 The strict biological definition of a fish, above, is sometimes called a true fish. True fish are also referred to as ''finfish'' or ''fin fish'' to distinguish them from other [[aquatic life]] harvested in fisheries or aquaculture.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Faina de Pesca,Sesimbra.jpg|thumb|right|Fishermen in [[Sesimbra]], Portugal]]\nFisheries are harvested for their value ([[Commercial fishing|commercial]], [[Recreational fishing|recreational]] or [[Artisan fishing|subsistence]]). They can be [[Seawater|saltwater]] or [[freshwater]], [[Wildlife|wild]] or [[farmed]]. Examples are the [[salmon]] fishery of [[Alaska]], the [[Atlantic cod|cod]] fishery off the [[Lofoten]] islands, the [[tuna]] fishery of the [[Pacific Ocean|Eastern Pacific]], or the [[shrimp farm]] fisheries in [[China]]. Capture fisheries can be broadly classified as industrial scale, small-scale or artisanal, and recreational.\n\nClose to 90% of the world's fishery catches come from [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s, as opposed to inland waters. These marine catches have remained relatively stable since the mid-nineties (between 80 and 86 million tonnes).<ref>{{cite web | title=Scientific Facts on Fisheries| publisher=GreenFacts Website | date=2009-03-02 | accessdate=2009-03-25 | url= http://www.greenfacts.org/en/fisheries/index.htm\n}}</ref> Most marine fisheries are based near the [[coast]]. This is not only because harvesting from relatively shallow waters is easier than in the open ocean, but also because fish are much more abundant near the [[coast|coastal shelf]], due to the abundance of [[nutrient]]s available there from [[upwelling|coastal upwelling]] and [[land runoff]]. However, productive wild fisheries also exist in open oceans, particularly by [[seamount]]s, and inland in lakes and rivers.\n\nMost fisheries are [[wild fisheries]], but [[Fish farm|farmed fisheries]] are increasing. Farming can occur in coastal areas, such as with [[Oyster farming|oyster farms]],<ref>New Zealand Seafood Industry Council. [http://www.seafood.co.nz/musselfarming ''Mussel Farming.'']</ref> but more typically occur inland, in lakes, ponds, tanks and other enclosures.\n\nThere are species fisheries worldwide for finfish, [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s and [[echinoderm]]s, and by extension, [[aquatic plant]]s such as [[kelp]]. However, a very small number of species support the majority of the world's fisheries. Some of these species are [[herring]], [[cod]], [[anchovy]], tuna, [[flounder]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[squid]], [[shrimp]], salmon, [[crab]], [[lobster]], [[oyster]] and [[scallop]]s. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a [[million]] [[tonne]]s in 1999, with herring and [[sardine]]s together providing a harvest of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species are harvested in smaller numbers.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Global capture fisheries and aquaculture production, 1990-2030.svg|thumb|right|Global capture fisheries and aquaculture production reported by FAO, 1990-2030]]\n\nTotal fish production in 2016 reached an all-time high of 171 million tonnes, of which 88 percent was utilized for direct human consumption, thanks to relatively stable capture fisheries production, reduced wastage and continued aquaculture growth.
