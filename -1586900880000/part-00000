It was first defined by the [[IEEE 802.3|IEEE 802.3ae-2002]] standard. Unlike previous Ethernet standards, 10 Gigabit Ethernet defines only [[Duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex]] point-to-point links which are generally connected by [[network switch]]es; shared-medium [[CSMA/CD]] operation has not been carried over from the previous generations Ethernet standards<ref name=\"Palmer\">{{cite book |author=Michael Palmer |title=Hands-On Networking Fundamentals, 2nd ed. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QELAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA180 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-1-285-40275-8|page=180}}</ref> so half-duplex operation and [[Ethernet hub|repeater hubs]] do not exist in 10GbE.<ref>IEEE 802.3-2012 ''44.1.1 Scope''</ref>\n\nThe 10 Gigabit Ethernet standard encompasses a number of different [[physical layer]] (PHY) standards.

PHY modules are not specified in an official standards body but by [[multi-source agreement]]s (MSAs) that can be negotiated more quickly. Relevant MSAs for 10GbE include [[XENPAK]] (and related X2 and XPAK), [[XFP]] and [[SFP+]]. When choosing a PHY module, a designer considers cost, reach, media type, power consumption, and size (form factor).  A single point-to-point link can have different MSA pluggable formats on either end (e.g. XPAK and SFP+) as long as the 10GbE optical or copper port type (e.g. 10GBASE-SR) supported by the pluggable is identical.\n\nXENPAK was the first MSA for 10GE and had the largest form factor. X2 and XPAK were later competing standards with smaller form factors. X2 and XPAK have not been as successful in the market as XENPAK. XFP came after X2 and XPAK and it is also smaller.\n\nThe newest module standard is the [[enhanced small form-factor pluggable transceiver]], generally called SFP+. Based on the [[small form-factor pluggable transceiver]] (SFP) and developed by the ANSI T11 [[fibre channel]] group, it is smaller still and lower power than XFP. SFP+ has become the most popular socket on 10GE systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightcounting.com/lighttrends/1004/|title=LightCounting's LightTrends April 2010|accessdate=3 May 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyquistcapital.com/2007/11/28/10gbe-and-sfp-this-time-its-different/|title=10GbE Optical Component and SFP+ Modules: This Time It's Different by Andrew Schmitt|accessdate=11 March 2008}}</ref> SFP+ modules do only optical to electrical conversion, no clock and data recovery, putting a higher burden on the host's channel equalization.  SFP+ modules share a common physical form factor with legacy SFP modules, allowing higher port density than XFP and the re-use of existing designs for 24 or 48 ports in a [[19-inch rack]] width blade.\n\nOptical modules are connected to a host by either a [[XAUI]], [[XFI]] or [[SerDes Framer Interface]] (SFI) interface. XENPAK, X2, and XPAK modules use XAUI to connect to their hosts. XAUI (XGXS) uses a four-lane data channel and is specified in IEEE 802.3 Clause 47. XFP modules use a XFI interface and SFP+ modules use an SFI interface. XFI and SFI use a single lane data channel and the [[64b/66b encoding]] specified in IEEE 802.3 Clause 49.\n\nSFP+ modules can further be grouped into two types of host interfaces: linear or limiting. Limiting modules are preferred except when for long-reach applications using 10GBASE-LRM modules.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lw.pennnet.com/display_article/317903/13/ARTCL/none/OTRAT/1/The-road-to-SFP+:-Examining-module-and-system-architectures/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516214920/http://lw.pennnet.com/display_article/317903/13/ARTCL/none/OTRAT/1/The-road-to-SFP+:-Examining-module-and-system-architectures/ |archive-date=2008-05-16 |title=The road to SFP+: Examining module and system architectures |author1=Ryan Latchman |author2=Bharat Tailor}}</ref>\n\n{{Fibre legend}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

SMF is used for long distance communication and MMF is used for distances of less than 300&nbsp;m. SMF has a narrower core (8.3&nbsp;\u03bcm) which requires a more precise termination and connection method. MMF has a wider core (50 or 62.5&nbsp;\u03bcm). The advantage of MMF is that it can be driven by a low cost [[Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser]] (VCSEL) for short distances, and multi-mode connectors are cheaper and easier to terminate reliably in the field.

The 802.3 standard also references [[ISO/IEC 11801]] which specifies [[Multi-mode optical fiber#Types|optical MMF fiber types]] OM1, OM2, OM3 and OM4. OM1 has a 62.5&nbsp;\u03bcm core while the others have a 50&nbsp;\u03bcm core.

The WAN PHY encapsulates Ethernet packets in [[Synchronous optical networking|SONET]] OC-192c frames and operates at a slightly slower data-rate (9.95328&nbsp;Gbit/s) than the [[local area network]] (LAN) PHY.\n\nThe WAN PHY uses the same 10GBASE-S, 10GBASE-L and 10GBASE-E optical PMDs as the LAN PHYs and is designated as 10GBASE-SW, 10GBASE-LW or 10GBASE-EW. Its 64b/66b PCS is defined in IEEE 802.3 Clause 49 and its PMD sublayers in Clauses 52. It also uses a WAN Interface Sublayer (WIS) defined in Clause 50 which adds extra encapsulation to format the frame data to be compatible with SONET STS-192c.<ref name=\"ethernet_spec\" />\n\nThe WAN PHY was designed to interoperate with OC-192/STM-64 [[Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]]/[[SONET]] equipment using a light-weight SDH/SONET frame running at 9.953&nbsp;Gbit/s.\n\nThe WAN PHY can drive maximum link distances up to 80&nbsp;km depending on the fiber standard employed.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[GG45]]\n* [[List of device bandwidths]]\n* [[Optical communication]]\n* [[Optical fiber cable]]\n* [[Parallel optical interface]]\n* [[TERA]]\n* [[XAUI]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/802.3.html Full text of the IEEE 802.3 standard]\n* [http://www.ieee802.org/3/ IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Working Group]\n* [http://www.ethernetalliance.org Ethernet Alliance website]\n* [http://www.iol.unh.edu/consortiums/10gec/ University of New Hampshire Interoperability Laboratory 10 Gigabit Ethernet Consortium]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141219175107/http://www.ampnetconnect.es/web/MEA/Home/Current/News/News_Detail/?news_id=8160 World's First Independent 10GBASE-T Comparative Test Study]\n* [http://www.intel.com/Assets/PDF/prodbrief/Intel_10_Gig_AFDA_Dual_Port_prodbrief.pdf Description of SFP+ Direct Attach server NIC in top-of-rack concept]\n\n{{Ethernet}}\n\n[[Category:Ethernet]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Standards for Ethernet on cables or fibers at ten times the speed of Gigabit Ethernet}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n\n[[File:Avaya-10G-ERS-8600.png|thumb|upright=1.4| [[Router (computing)|Router]] with 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports and three physical layer module types ]]\n\n'''10 Gigabit Ethernet''' ('''10GE''', '''10GbE''', or '''10 GigE''') is a group of [[computer network]]ing technologies for transmitting [[Ethernet frame]]s at a rate of 10 [[Data rate units#Gigabit per second|gigabits per second]].

PHY modules are not specified in an official standards body but by [[multi-source agreement]]s (MSAs) that can be negotiated more quickly. Relevant MSAs for 10GbE include [[XENPAK]] (and related X2 and XPAK), [[XFP]] and [[SFP+]]. When choosing a PHY module, a designer considers cost, reach, media type, power consumption, and size (form factor).  A single point-to-point link can have different MSA pluggable formats on either end (e.g. XPAK and SFP+) as long as the 10GbE optical or copper port type (e.g. 10GBASE-SR) supported by the pluggable is identical.\n\nXENPAK was the first MSA for 10GE and had the largest form factor. X2 and XPAK were later competing standards with smaller form factors. X2 and XPAK have not been as successful in the market as XENPAK. XFP came after X2 and XPAK and it is also smaller.\n\nThe newest module standard is the [[enhanced small form-factor pluggable transceiver]], generally called SFP+. Based on the [[small form-factor pluggable transceiver]] (SFP) and developed by the ANSI T11 [[fibre channel]] group, it is smaller still and lower power than XFP. SFP+ has become the most popular socket on 10GE systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightcounting.com/lighttrends/1004/|title=LightCounting's LightTrends April 2010|accessdate=3 May 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyquistcapital.com/2007/11/28/10gbe-and-sfp-this-time-its-different/|title=10GbE Optical Component and SFP+ Modules: This Time It's Different by Andrew Schmitt|accessdate=11 March 2008}}</ref> SFP+ modules do only optical to electrical conversion, no clock and data recovery, putting a higher burden on the host's channel equalization.  SFP+ modules share a common physical form factor with legacy SFP modules, allowing higher port density than XFP and the re-use of existing designs for 24 or 48 ports in a [[19-inch rack]] width blade.\n\nOptical modules are connected to a host by either a [[XAUI]], [[XFI]] or [[SerDes Framer Interface]] (SFI) interface. XENPAK, X2, and XPAK modules use XAUI to connect to their hosts. XAUI (XGXS) uses a four-lane data channel and is specified in IEEE 802.3 Clause 47. XFP modules use a XFI interface and SFP+ modules use an SFI interface. XFI and SFI use a single lane data channel and the [[64b/66b encoding]] specified in IEEE 802.3 Clause 49.\n\nSFP+ modules can further be grouped into two types of host interfaces: linear or limiting. Limiting modules are preferred except when for long-reach applications using 10GBASE-LRM modules.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lw.pennnet.com/display_article/317903/13/ARTCL/none/OTRAT/1/The-road-to-SFP+:-Examining-module-and-system-architectures/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516214920/http://lw.pennnet.com/display_article/317903/13/ARTCL/none/OTRAT/1/The-road-to-SFP+:-Examining-module-and-system-architectures/ |archive-date=2008-05-16 |title=The road to SFP+: Examining module and system architectures |author1=Ryan Latchman |author2=Bharat Tailor}}</ref>\n\n{{Fibre legend}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

SMF is used for long distance communication and MMF is used for distances of less than 300&nbsp;m. SMF has a narrower core (8.3&nbsp;\u03bcm) which requires a more precise termination and connection method. MMF has a wider core (50 or 62.5&nbsp;\u03bcm). The advantage of MMF is that it can be driven by a low cost [[Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser]] (VCSEL) for short distances, and multi-mode connectors are cheaper and easier to terminate reliably in the field. The advantage of SMF is that it can work over longer distances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corning.com/docs/opticalfiber/cn0603.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730144831/http://www.corning.com/docs/opticalfiber/cn0603.pdf |archive-date=2014-07-30 |title=Why choose Multimode fiber? by Corning}}</ref>\n\nIn the 802.3 standard, reference is made to FDDI-grade MMF fiber. This has a 62.5&nbsp;\u03bcm core and a minimum [[modal bandwidth]] of 160&nbsp;MHz\u00b7km at 850&nbsp;nm. It was originally installed in the early 1990s for [[FDDI]] and [[100BASE-FX]] networks. The 802.3 standard also references [[ISO/IEC 11801]] which specifies [[Multi-mode optical fiber#Types|optical MMF fiber types]] OM1, OM2, OM3 and OM4. OM1 has a 62.5&nbsp;\u03bcm core while the others have a 50&nbsp;\u03bcm core. At 850&nbsp;nm the minimum modal bandwidth of OM1 is 200&nbsp;MHz\u00b7km, of OM2 500&nbsp;MHz\u00b7km, of OM3 2000&nbsp;MHz\u00b7km and of OM4 4700&nbsp;MHz\u00b7km.

In yet others, the infection may still be in the incubation period, when it is asymptomatic and may not yet be detectable even by testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/03/200309110456.htm|title=COVID-19 infections in U.S. may be much higher, new estimates show|date=|website=sciencedaily.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n<div class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:800px; margin:1em 0;\"><center>'''COVID19 Epidemic curve selected countries (Logarithmic scale / from the 100th case)'''</center>\n{{Graph:Chart\n|type=line\n|linewidth=3\n|width=600\n|height=600\n|xAxisTitle= Day \n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|yAxisTitle= No. of new cases\n|legend= Legend \n<!-- PLease clipboard copy the \"}x=...\" and \"y1=...\" lines from the log plot of total cases when you update these charts -->\n\n<!-- Search string CASES_X -->\n|x=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,\n<!-- Search string CASES_Y -->\n|y1Title=Italy\n|y1=100,229,322,445,650,888,1128,1694,2036,2502,3089,3858,4636,5883,7375,9172,10149,12462,15113,17660,21157,24747,27980,31506,35713,41035,47021,53578,59138,63927,69176,74386,80539,86498,92472,97889,101739,105793,110574,115242,119827,124632,128948,132547,135586,139422,143626,147577,152271,156363,159516,\n|y4Title=China\n|y4=100,198,270,300,400,547,639,916,1399,2062,2863,5494,6070,8125,9783,11871,16607,19693,23680,27409,30553,34075,36778,39790,42306,44699,59832,66292,68347,70446,72364,74158,75002,75891,76288,76936,77150,77658,78064,78824,79251,79824,80026,80151,80270,80409,80552,80651,80695,80735,80754,80778,80793,80813,80824,80844,80860,80881,\n|y3Title=Czech Rep.\n|y3=100,116,141,189,198,383,450,560,765,889,1047,1161,1287,1472,1763,2022,2395,2657,2817,3001,3308,3589,3858,4190,4472,4587,4822,5017,5312,5569,5732,5902,5991,6059,\n|y2Title=Netherlands\n|y2=100,128,188,264,321,382,503,614,804,959,1135,1413,1705,2051,2460,2994,3631,4204,4749,5560,6412,7431,8603,9762,10866,11750,12595,13614,14697,15723,16627,17851,18803,19580,20549,21762,23097,24413,25587,26551,\n|y5Title=S.Korea\n|y5=100,204,433,602,833,977,1261,1766,2337,3150,3736,4335,5186,5621,6088,6593,7041,7314,7478,7513,7755,7869,7979,8086,8162,8236,8320,8413,8565,8652,8799,8897,8961,9037,9137,9241,9332,9478,9583,9661,9786,9887,9976,10062,10156,10237,10284,10331,10384,10423,10450,10480,10512,10537,10564,\n|y10Title=Slovakia\n|y10=100,105,123,138,179,186,204,216,226,269,292,314,336,363,400,426,450,471,485,534,581,682,701,715,728,742,769,\n|y7Title=Germany\n|y7=100,151,188,240,349,534,684,847,1112,1565,1966,2745,3675,4585,5813,6012,7156,8198,10999,13957,16662,18610,22672,27436,31554,36508,42228,48582,52547,57298,61913,67336,73522,79696,85778,91714,95391,99225,103228,108202,113525,117658,120479,123016,125098,\n|y8Title=Japan\n|y8=100,132,144,157,164,186,210,230,239,254,268,284,317,349,408,455,488,514,568,620,675,716,780,814,829,873,914,950,1007,1054,1086,1128,1193,1291,1387,1499,1693,1866,1953,2178,2384,2617,2920,3139,3654,3906,4257,4667,5347,6005,6748,7370,\n|y9Title=Sweden\n|y9=100,137,161,203,260,356,500,687,814,941,1032,1121,1196,1292,1439,1639,1770,1934,2046,2286,2824,3069,3447,3700,4028,4435,4947,5466,6131,6443,6830,7206,7693,8419,9141,9685,10151,10446,10865,10948,\n|y6Title=United States\n|y6=100,175,252,353,497,645,936,1205,1598,2163,2825,3501,4373,5664,8074,12022,17439,23710,32341,42751,52690,64916,81966,101012,121105,140223,160686,186082,212814,241626,273808,307876,333593,362955,393602,425746,459989,493567,525436,553493,578178,\n|yGrid= |xGrid=\n|yScaleType=log<!-- This is the line that makes this plot have a log axis -->\n|yAxisMin = 100 <!-- Needed to avoid trying to show the values y2, y3 of 0, impossible on log scale because log(0)=-infinity -->\n}}</div>\n<small>*Datasource: Wikipedia</small>\n\n<small>Czech restriction actions:/ '''Day0''': Schools closed / '''Day2''': State of Emergency: close of sport facilities&amp;close restaurants&amp;bars at 8pm,border control,travel restrictions,ban 30+events /'''Day3''': Criminalize spreading virus on purpose/'''Day4''': Complete closure all shops restaurants&amp;bars ex:food shops,petrol,pharmacies/'''Day5''': Nationwide quarantine ex: shopping, employment need/ '''Day6''': Borders closed&amp;closure municipalities in Olomouc region/ '''Day8''': Mandatory nose&amp;mouth cover / '''Day9''': Special 7\u20139 shop-opening hours for seniors.\n</small>\n\n==Basic reproduction number==\nIn epidemiology, [[Basic reproduction number|the basic reproduction number]] (sometimes called basic reproductive ratio, or incorrectly basic reproductive rate, and denoted R<sub>0</sub>, pronounced R nought or R zero<ref>Milligan, Gregg N.; Barrett, Alan D.

In yet others, the infection may still be in the incubation period, when it is asymptomatic and may not yet be detectable even by testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/03/200309110456.htm|title=COVID-19 infections in U.S. may be much higher, new estimates show|date=|website=sciencedaily.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n<div class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:800px; margin:1em 0;\"><center>'''COVID19 Epidemic curve selected countries (Logarithmic scale / from the 100th case)'''</center>\n{{Graph:Chart\n|type=line\n|linewidth=3\n|width=600\n|height=600\n|xAxisTitle= Day \n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|yAxisTitle= No. of new cases\n|legend= Legend \n<!-- PLease clipboard copy the \"}x=...\" and \"y1=...\" lines from the log plot of total cases when you update these charts -->\n\n<!-- Search string CASES_X -->\n|x=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,\n<!-- Search string CASES_Y -->\n|y1Title=Italy\n|y1=100,229,322,445,650,888,1128,1694,2036,2502,3089,3858,4636,5883,7375,9172,10149,12462,15113,17660,21157,24747,27980,31506,35713,41035,47021,53578,59138,63927,69176,74386,80539,86498,92472,97889,101739,105793,110574,115242,119827,124632,128948,132547,135586,139422,143626,147577,152271,156363,159516,\n|y4Title=China\n|y4=100,198,270,300,400,547,639,916,1399,2062,2863,5494,6070,8125,9783,11871,16607,19693,23680,27409,30553,34075,36778,39790,42306,44699,59832,66292,68347,70446,72364,74158,75002,75891,76288,76936,77150,77658,78064,78824,79251,79824,80026,80151,80270,80409,80552,80651,80695,80735,80754,80778,80793,80813,80824,80844,80860,80881,\n|y3Title=Czech Rep.\n|y3=100,116,141,189,198,383,450,560,765,889,1047,1161,1287,1472,1763,2022,2395,2657,2817,3001,3308,3589,3858,4190,4472,4587,4822,5017,5312,5569,5732,5902,5991,6059,\n|y2Title=Netherlands\n|y2=100,128,188,264,321,382,503,614,804,959,1135,1413,1705,2051,2460,2994,3631,4204,4749,5560,6412,7431,8603,9762,10866,11750,12595,13614,14697,15723,16627,17851,18803,19580,20549,21762,23097,24413,25587,26551,\n|y5Title=S.Korea\n|y5=100,204,433,602,833,977,1261,1766,2337,3150,3736,4335,5186,5621,6088,6593,7041,7314,7478,7513,7755,7869,7979,8086,8162,8236,8320,8413,8565,8652,8799,8897,8961,9037,9137,9241,9332,9478,9583,9661,9786,9887,9976,10062,10156,10237,10284,10331,10384,10423,10450,10480,10512,10537,10564,\n|y10Title=Slovakia\n|y10=100,105,123,138,179,186,204,216,226,269,292,314,336,363,400,426,450,471,485,534,581,682,701,715,728,742,769,\n|y7Title=Germany\n|y7=100,151,188,240,349,534,684,847,1112,1565,1966,2745,3675,4585,5813,6012,7156,8198,10999,13957,16662,18610,22672,27436,31554,36508,42228,48582,52547,57298,61913,67336,73522,79696,85778,91714,95391,99225,103228,108202,113525,117658,120479,123016,125098,\n|y8Title=Japan\n|y8=100,132,144,157,164,186,210,230,239,254,268,284,317,349,408,455,488,514,568,620,675,716,780,814,829,873,914,950,1007,1054,1086,1128,1193,1291,1387,1499,1693,1866,1953,2178,2384,2617,2920,3139,3654,3906,4257,4667,5347,6005,6748,7370,\n|y9Title=Sweden\n|y9=100,137,161,203,260,356,500,687,814,941,1032,1121,1196,1292,1439,1639,1770,1934,2046,2286,2824,3069,3447,3700,4028,4435,4947,5466,6131,6443,6830,7206,7693,8419,9141,9685,10151,10446,10865,10948,\n|y6Title=United States\n|y6=100,175,252,353,497,645,936,1205,1598,2163,2825,3501,4373,5664,8074,12022,17439,23710,32341,42751,52690,64916,81966,101012,121105,140223,160686,186082,212814,241626,273808,307876,333593,362955,393602,425746,459989,493567,525436,553493,578178,\n|yGrid= |xGrid=\n|yScaleType=log<!-- This is the line that makes this plot have a log axis -->\n|yAxisMin = 100 <!-- Needed to avoid trying to show the values y2, y3 of 0, impossible on log scale because log(0)=-infinity -->\n}}</div>\n<small>*Datasource: Wikipedia</small>\n\n<small>Czech restriction actions:/ '''Day0''': Schools closed / '''Day2''': State of Emergency: close of sport facilities&amp;close restaurants&amp;bars at 8pm,border control,travel restrictions,ban 30+events /'''Day3''': Criminalize spreading virus on purpose/'''Day4''': Complete closure all shops restaurants&amp;bars ex:food shops,petrol,pharmacies/'''Day5''': Nationwide quarantine ex: shopping, employment need/ '''Day6''': Borders closed&amp;closure municipalities in Olomouc region/ '''Day8''': Mandatory nose&amp;mouth cover / '''Day9''': Special 7\u20139 shop-opening hours for seniors.\n</small>\n\n==Basic reproduction number==\nIn epidemiology, [[Basic reproduction number|the basic reproduction number]] (sometimes called basic reproductive ratio, or incorrectly basic reproductive rate, and denoted R<sub>0</sub>, pronounced R nought or R zero<ref>Milligan, Gregg N.; Barrett, Alan D.

Kim taehyung is the best along with bts \n\nSurface gravity is measured in units of acceleration, which, in the [[SI units|SI]] system, are [[metre per second squared|meters per second squared]].

The neutron star's compactness gives it a surface gravity of up to 7{{e|12}} m/s\u00b2 with typical values of order 10<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;m/s\u00b2 (that is more than 10<sup>11</sup> times that of Earth). One measure of such immense gravity is that neutron stars have an [[escape velocity]] of around [[Orders of magnitude (speed)#8|100,000 km/s]], about a third of the [[speed of light]].

Newtonian gravity also follows an [[inverse square law]], so that moving an object twice as far away divides its gravitational force by four, and moving it ten times as far away divides it by 100. This is similar to the intensity of [[light]], which also follows an inverse square law: with relation to distance, light becomes less visible.  Generally speaking, this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space.\n\nA large object, such as a [[planet]] or [[star]], will usually be approximately round, approaching [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (where all points on the surface have the same amount of [[gravitational potential energy]]). On a small scale, higher parts of the terrain are eroded, with eroded material deposited in lower parts of the terrain. On a large scale, the planet or star itself deforms until equilibrium is reached.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Why is the Earth round?\n| website = Ask A Scientist\n| url = http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen99/gen99251.htm\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080921075319/http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen99/gen99251.htm\n| archive-date = 21 September 2008\n| publisher = Argonne National Laboratory, Division of Educational Programs}}</ref> For most celestial objects, the result is that the planet or star in question can be treated as a near-perfect [[sphere]] when the rotation rate is low. However, for young, massive stars, the equatorial [[azimuth]]al velocity can be quite high\u2014up to 200&nbsp;km/s or more\u2014causing a significant amount of [[equatorial bulge]]. Examples of such [[stellar rotation|rapidly rotating stars]] include [[Achernar]], [[Altair]], [[Regulus|Regulus A]] and [[Vega]].\n\nThe fact that many large celestial objects are approximately spheres makes it easier to calculate their surface gravity. The gravitational force outside a spherically symmetric body is the same as if its entire mass were concentrated in the center, as was established by [[Sir Isaac Newton]].<ref>Book I, &sect;XII, pp. 218\u2013226, ''Newton's Principia: The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'', Sir Isaac Newton, tr.

The surface gravity of infinite planes, tubes, lines, hollow shells, cones, and even more unrealistic structures may be used to provide insights into the behavior of real structures.\n\n==Black holes==\nIn relativity, the Newtonian concept of acceleration turns out not to be clear cut. For a black hole, which must be treated relativistically, one cannot define a surface gravity as the acceleration experienced by a test body at the object's surface. This is because the acceleration of a test body at the event horizon of a black hole turns out to be infinite in relativity.  Because of this, a renormalized value is used that corresponds to the Newtonian value in the non-relativistic limit.  The value used is generally the local proper acceleration (which diverges at the event horizon) multiplied by the [[gravitational time dilation]] factor (which goes to zero at the event horizon).  For the Schwarzschild case, this value is mathematically well behaved for all non-zero values of ''r'' and&nbsp;''M''.\n\nWhen one talks about the surface gravity of a black hole, one is defining a notion that behaves analogously to the Newtonian surface gravity, but is not the same thing. In fact, the surface gravity of a general black hole is not well defined. However, one can define the surface gravity for a black hole whose event horizon is a Killing horizon.\n\nThe surface gravity <math>\\kappa</math> of a static [[Killing horizon]] is the acceleration, as exerted at infinity, needed to keep an object at the horizon. Mathematically, if <math>k^a</math> is a suitably normalized [[Killing vector]], then the surface gravity is defined by\n\n:<math>k^a \\,\\nabla_a k^b = \\kappa k^b,</math>\n\nwhere the equation is evaluated at the horizon. For a static and asymptotically flat spacetime, the normalization should be chosen so that <math>k^a k_a \\rightarrow -1</math> as <math>r\\rightarrow\\infty</math>, and so that <math>\\kappa \\geq 0</math>. For the Schwarzschild solution, we take <math>k^a</math> to be the [[time translation]] [[Killing vector]] <math>k^a\\partial_a = \\frac \\partial {\\partial t}</math>, and more generally for the [[Kerr\u2013Newman solution]] we take <math>k^a\\partial_a = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\Omega \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\varphi}</math>, the linear combination of the time translation and axisymmetry Killing vectors which is null at the horizon, where <math>\\Omega</math> is the angular velocity.\n\n===Schwarzschild solution===\nSince <math>k^a</math> is a Killing vector <math>k^a \\,\\nabla_a k^b = \\kappa k^b </math> implies <math> -k^a \\,\\nabla^b k_a = \\kappa k^b</math>.

The neutron star's compactness gives it a surface gravity of up to 7{{e|12}} m/s\u00b2 with typical values of order 10<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;m/s\u00b2 (that is more than 10<sup>11</sup> times that of Earth). One measure of such immense gravity is that neutron stars have an [[escape velocity]] of around [[Orders of magnitude (speed)#8|100,000 km/s]], about a third of the [[speed of light]].

Newtonian gravity also follows an [[inverse square law]], so that moving an object twice as far away divides its gravitational force by four, and moving it ten times as far away divides it by 100. This is similar to the intensity of [[light]], which also follows an inverse square law: with relation to distance, light becomes less visible.  Generally speaking, this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space.\n\nA large object, such as a [[planet]] or [[star]], will usually be approximately round, approaching [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (where all points on the surface have the same amount of [[gravitational potential energy]]). On a small scale, higher parts of the terrain are eroded, with eroded material deposited in lower parts of the terrain. On a large scale, the planet or star itself deforms until equilibrium is reached.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Why is the Earth round?\n| website = Ask A Scientist\n| url = http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen99/gen99251.htm\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080921075319/http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen99/gen99251.htm\n| archive-date = 21 September 2008\n| publisher = Argonne National Laboratory, Division of Educational Programs}}</ref> For most celestial objects, the result is that the planet or star in question can be treated as a near-perfect [[sphere]] when the rotation rate is low.

This fact has been put to practical use since 1915\u20131916, when [[Roland E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]]'s [[torsion balance]] was used to prospect for [[oil]] near the city of [[Egbell]] (now [[Gbely]], [[Slovakia]].)<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1190/1.1487109|title=Ellipsoid, geoid, gravity, geodesy, and geophysics|journal=Geophysics|volume=66|issue=6|pages=1660\u20131668|year=2001|last1=Li|first1=Xiong|last2=G\u00f6tze|first2=Hans\u2010J\u00fcrgen}}</ref><sup>,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;1663;</sup><ref name=\"hung\">[http://www.pp.bme.hu/ci/2002_2/pdf/ci2002_2_09.pdf Prediction by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s' torsion balance data in Hungary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128200353/http://www.pp.bme.hu/ci/2002_2/pdf/ci2002_2_09.pdf |date=2007-11-28 }}, Gyula T&oacute;th, ''Periodica Polytechnica Ser.

The surface gravity of infinite planes, tubes, lines, hollow shells, cones, and even more unrealistic structures may be used to provide insights into the behavior of real structures.\n\n==Black holes==\nIn relativity, the Newtonian concept of acceleration turns out not to be clear cut. For a black hole, which must be treated relativistically, one cannot define a surface gravity as the acceleration experienced by a test body at the object's surface. This is because the acceleration of a test body at the event horizon of a black hole turns out to be infinite in relativity.  Because of this, a renormalized value is used that corresponds to the Newtonian value in the non-relativistic limit.  The value used is generally the local proper acceleration (which diverges at the event horizon) multiplied by the [[gravitational time dilation]] factor (which goes to zero at the event horizon).  For the Schwarzschild case, this value is mathematically well behaved for all non-zero values of ''r'' and&nbsp;''M''.\n\nWhen one talks about the surface gravity of a black hole, one is defining a notion that behaves analogously to the Newtonian surface gravity, but is not the same thing. In fact, the surface gravity of a general black hole is not well defined. However, one can define the surface gravity for a black hole whose event horizon is a Killing horizon.\n\nThe surface gravity <math>\\kappa</math> of a static [[Killing horizon]] is the acceleration, as exerted at infinity, needed to keep an object at the horizon. Mathematically, if <math>k^a</math> is a suitably normalized [[Killing vector]], then the surface gravity is defined by\n\n:<math>k^a \\,\\nabla_a k^b = \\kappa k^b,</math>\n\nwhere the equation is evaluated at the horizon. For a static and asymptotically flat spacetime, the normalization should be chosen so that <math>k^a k_a \\rightarrow -1</math> as <math>r\\rightarrow\\infty</math>, and so that <math>\\kappa \\geq 0</math>. For the Schwarzschild solution, we take <math>k^a</math> to be the [[time translation]] [[Killing vector]] <math>k^a\\partial_a = \\frac \\partial {\\partial t}</math>, and more generally for the [[Kerr\u2013Newman solution]] we take <math>k^a\\partial_a = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\Omega \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\varphi}</math>, the linear combination of the time translation and axisymmetry Killing vectors which is null at the horizon, where <math>\\Omega</math> is the angular velocity.\n\n===Schwarzschild solution===\nSince <math>k^a</math> is a Killing vector <math>k^a \\,\\nabla_a k^b = \\kappa k^b </math> implies <math> -k^a \\,\\nabla^b k_a = \\kappa k^b</math>. In <math>(t,r,\\theta,\\varphi)</math> coordinates <math>k^a=(1,0,0,0)</math>. Performing a coordinate change to the advanced Eddington\u2013Finklestein coordinates <math>v = t+r+2M\\ln |r-2M|</math> causes the metric to take the form\n\n: <math>ds^2 = -\\left(1-\\frac{2M} r \\right)\\,dv^2+2\\,dv\\,dr+r^2 \\left(d\\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta\\, d\\varphi^2\\right).</math>\n\nUnder a general change of coordinates the Killing vector transforms as <math>k^v = A_t^v k^t</math> giving the vectors <math>k^{a'}=(1,0,0,0)</math> and <math>k_{a'} = \\left(-1+\\frac{2M} r ,1,0,0\\right).</math>\n\nConsidering the ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''v'' entry for <math>k^a \\,\\nabla_a k^b = \\kappa k^b</math> gives the differential equation <math>-\\frac 1 2 \\frac \\partial {\\partial r} \\left( -1+\\frac{2M} r \\right) = \\kappa.</math>\n\nTherefore, the surface gravity for the [[Schwarzschild solution]] with mass <math>M</math> is <math>\\kappa = \\frac 1 {4M}.</math><ref>{{cite book |title=Black Holes: An Introduction |edition=illustrated |first1=Derek J. |last1=Raine |first2=Edwin George |last2=Thomas |publisher=[[Imperial College Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-84816-382-9 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3puAMw5U3UC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=O3puAMw5U3UC&pg=PA44 Extract of page 44]</ref>\n\n===Kerr solution===\nThe surface gravity for the uncharged, rotating black hole is, simply\n\n:<math>\\kappa = g - k , </math>\n\nwhere <math>g = \\frac 1 {4M}</math> is the Schwarzschild surface gravity, and <math>k := M \\Omega_+^2 </math> is the spring constant of the rotating black hole. <math>\\Omega_+</math> is the angular velocity at the event horizon.

Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi women are widowed as a result of a series of wars and internal conflicts. Women's rights organizations struggle against harassment and intimidation, while they work to promote improvements to women's status in the law, in education, the workplace, and many other spheres of Iraqi life, and to curtail abusive traditional practices such as [[honor killings]] and [[forced marriages]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{See also|Women in Islam}}\n\nDuring the seventh century  the [[lama]]s as a part of their conquest were [[Islamic conquest of Persia|fighting the Persians]], who were defeated.

In particular, a woman called Amina bint Qais \"at the age of seventeen was the youngest woman to lead a [[Bimaristan|medical team]] in one of these early battles.\"<ref name=\"Insgrams\">Doreen Insgrams, The Awakened: Women in Iraq.

In the 1920s there was a \"major uprising where women took part\" (p.&nbsp;27). In 1932, Iraq was declared independent and in 1958 was declared a Republic as a member of the League of Nations. As Doreen Ingrams argues, instability was dominating the region until 1968 when \"the Ba\u2019ath Party took control over the President Al Bakr and Iraq began to enjoy a period of stability\" (p.&nbsp;28).

It has been very active in Iraq for several years, with thousands of members, and it is the Iraqi women's rights organization with the largest international profile. It was founded in June 2003 by [[Yanar Mohammed]], Nasik Ahmad and Nadia Mahmood. It defends full social equality between women and men and [[secularism]], and fights against [[Islamic fundamentalism]] and the [[American occupation of Iraq]]. Its president is [[Yanar Mohammed]].\n\nOWFI originated with the Organisation ind\u00e9pendante des femmes, active in [[Kurdistan]] from 1992 to 2003 despite government and religious oppression, and the Coalition de d\u00e9fense des droits des femmes irakiennes, founded in 1998 by Iraqi women in exile. OWFI concentrates its activities on the fight against [[sharia law]], against abduction and murder of women and against [[honour killings]]. Thousands of members strong, it has at its disposal a network of support from outside Iraq, notably from the [[United States]]. It also has members in Great Britain, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Finland, and Denmark. Its activists and its directors have many times been the object of death threats from Islamic organizations.\n\nThe circumstances resulting from the [[Gulf War]] and then the Kurdish uprising in [[Iraq]] in 1991, gave the Kurdish region of Iraq an essentially autonomous situation for a period, despite the conflicts between zones controlled by the largest nationalist parties. This allowed the development of some claims to women's rights, which in turn influenced some of the women who would become active in founding OWFI.\n\nThe founding statement of OWFI contains a mandate in six points:\n* To put in place a humanist law founded on equality and the assurance of the greatest freedom for women, and to abolish all forms of discriminatory laws;\n* To separate religion from the government and education;\n* To put an end to all forms of violence against women and honour killings, and to push for punishment for the murderers of women;\n* To abolish mandatory wearing of veils, the veil for children and to protect freedom of dress;\n* To put in place the equal participation of women and men in all social, economic, administrative and political spheres, at every level;\n* To abolish gender segregation in schools at all levels.\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq (OWFI) Founding Statement|url=http://www.wpiran.org/Organization%20of%20Women's%20Freedom%20in%20Iraq%20(OWFI).htm|publisher=Worker-communist Party of Iran|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSome militant women's rights advocates in Iraq, who seek to establish a dialogue with Islamist women, maintain a distance from the radical feminism and secularism of OWFI.<ref>{{in lang|en}} Nadje Al-Ali,Nadje Sadig Al-Ali,Nicola Christine Pratt, What kind of liberation?

Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi women are widowed as a result of a series of wars and internal conflicts. Women's rights organizations struggle against harassment and intimidation, while they work to promote improvements to women's status in the law, in education, the workplace, and many other spheres of Iraqi life, and to curtail abusive traditional practices such as [[honor killings]] and [[forced marriages]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{See also|Women in Islam}}\n\nDuring the seventh century  the [[lama]]s as a part of their conquest were [[Islamic conquest of Persia|fighting the Persians]], who were defeated.

It has been very active in Iraq for several years, with thousands of members, and it is the Iraqi women's rights organization with the largest international profile. It was founded in June 2003 by [[Yanar Mohammed]], Nasik Ahmad and Nadia Mahmood. It defends full social equality between women and men and [[secularism]], and fights against [[Islamic fundamentalism]] and the [[American occupation of Iraq]]. Its president is [[Yanar Mohammed]].\n\nOWFI originated with the Organisation ind\u00e9pendante des femmes, active in [[Kurdistan]] from 1992 to 2003 despite government and religious oppression, and the Coalition de d\u00e9fense des droits des femmes irakiennes, founded in 1998 by Iraqi women in exile. OWFI concentrates its activities on the fight against [[sharia law]], against abduction and murder of women and against [[honour killings]]. Thousands of members strong, it has at its disposal a network of support from outside Iraq, notably from the [[United States]]. It also has members in Great Britain, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Finland, and Denmark. Its activists and its directors have many times been the object of death threats from Islamic organizations.\n\nThe circumstances resulting from the [[Gulf War]] and then the Kurdish uprising in [[Iraq]] in 1991, gave the Kurdish region of Iraq an essentially autonomous situation for a period, despite the conflicts between zones controlled by the largest nationalist parties. This allowed the development of some claims to women's rights, which in turn influenced some of the women who would become active in founding OWFI.\n\nThe founding statement of OWFI contains a mandate in six points:\n* To put in place a humanist law founded on equality and the assurance of the greatest freedom for women, and to abolish all forms of discriminatory laws;\n* To separate religion from the government and education;\n* To put an end to all forms of violence against women and honour killings, and to push for punishment for the murderers of women;\n* To abolish mandatory wearing of veils, the veil for children and to protect freedom of dress;\n* To put in place the equal participation of women and men in all social, economic, administrative and political spheres, at every level;\n* To abolish gender segregation in schools at all levels.\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq (OWFI) Founding Statement|url=http://www.wpiran.org/Organization%20of%20Women's%20Freedom%20in%20Iraq%20(OWFI).htm|publisher=Worker-communist Party of Iran|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSome militant women's rights advocates in Iraq, who seek to establish a dialogue with Islamist women, maintain a distance from the radical feminism and secularism of OWFI.<ref>{{in lang|en}} Nadje Al-Ali,Nadje Sadig Al-Ali,Nicola Christine Pratt, What kind of liberation?

''The New Humanitarian''</ref>\n\nAs noted by Yasmin Husein, author of ''Women in Iraq'', the traditional role of women in Iraq is confined mainly to domestic responsibilities and nurturing the family.  The wide scale destruction of Iraq's infrastructure (i.e., sanitation, water supply and electricity) as a result of war and sanctions, worsened women's situation. Women, in the process, assumed extra burdens and domestic responsibilities in society, as opposed to their male counterparts.<ref>Yasmine Hussein, Al Jawaheri (2008), Women in Iraq, London: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 118-119</ref>\n\n== Women in the government and military ==\n{{See also|Federal government of Iraq|Iraqi Armed Forces}}\nThe Iraqi Constitution states that a quarter of the government must be made up of women. However, the women that hold position in the government still have little to no power. Often, the women in government are just relatives of other leaders. Serious women leaders in Iraq are unheard of. However, Iraq has been a leader on women's rights for quite some time. In the 1950s it became the first Arab country to have a female minister and to have a law that gave women the ability to ask for divorces.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coughlin|first=Kathryn M.|title=Muslim Women and the Family in Iraq: Modern World|url=http://dailylife.abc-clio.com/Search/Display/1424571?terms=iraq+women%27s+rights|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=25 Apr 2013}}</ref>  Women attained the right to vote and run for public office in 1980.

''Inter Press Service''</ref>\n\nThere is also a large divide among the women themselves, some more modern women wanting a larger percent of women in the Iraqi government still, and some more traditional women believing that they and others are not qualified enough to hold any sort of position in the Iraqi government. Another existing issue is the increasing amount of illiterate women in the country. In 1987 approximately 75 percent of Iraqi women were literate. In 2000, Iraq had the lowest regional adult literacy levels, with the percentage of literate women at less than 25 percent. This makes it increasingly difficult to put educated women in a position of power.<ref>{{cite web|title=Background on Women's Status in Iraq Prior to the Fall of the Saddam Hussein Government|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/wrd/iraq-women.htm|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there are many issues with the current spread of power among genders in Iraq, they are one of the more westernized Arab countries. However, there is hope for women in Iraq. After Hussein's fall in 2003, women's leaders in Iraq saw it as a key opportunity to gain more power in Parliament. The leaders asked for a quota that would have seen that at least 40 percent of the Parliament to be women.
