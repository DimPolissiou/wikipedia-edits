Due to frequent invasions by the Shandu and subsequent colonization by the British, the Ahraing Khami (Khumi) left their homeland. They emigrated to the hilly regions of the Kaladan River headwaters, and to the Pi Chaung and the Mi Chaung streams in the Arakan Hill Tracts where another group of Khami (Khumi), the Mro (Mru) and Ahraing Khami (Khumi), lived. To escape the Ahraing Khami (Khumi), the Mro (Mru) and  (Awa Khami) migrated to the Chittagong Hill Tracts where they currently reside.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=149}}</ref>\n\nAccording to legend, the hilly region was once ruled by Nga Maung Kadon, who built the barriers which form the waterfalls in all the streams and tributaries connected to the Kalapanzin River.

However, the Mro (Mru) and  ( Awa Khamis) are the oldest tribes living in the region. Together, they form the largest percentage of the population of the approximately 230 square miles Saingdin region.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\" />\nThe two main streams that flow through Saingdin are Re Chaung in the east and Sit Chaung in the west. Both streams originate from the northern part of the region which forms the boundary between Buthidaung Township and the Arakan Hill Tracts. The two streams meander between cliffs for 30 miles before they finally join together near Tharaungchaung village. The two streams flood during the [[monsoon]] season and normally subside after the rains. Water transportation is difficult due to large rocks obstructing the streams. Canoes and bamboo rafts are the only means of transportation to the interior area of the region.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\" />\nOn the sloping banks of the two streams, the Mro(Mru) grow tobacco in the alluvial deposits after clearing naturally grown ''kaing'' grass. They also grow paddy, cotton, cane, and bamboo to sell in a weekly bazaar near the waterfall.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 1931, the Saingdin area consists of 90 hamlets and each hamlet contains between two and twenty bamboo houses.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\"/> The population, according to the 1931 Census is 3,390, of which 1,779 are males.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\"/>\nCurrently, about 70,000 Mro (Mru) live on the border of Burma with India and Bangladesh. The majority of Mro (Mru) people, approximately 12,000, live in Burma within the Yoma District and the Arakan Hill Tracts of western Burma. These figures are, however, just rough estimates as the last census was conducted in 1931 when the country was under the colonial rule. At that time, the total number of Mro (Mru) people was estimated around 13,766. Around 200 more villages making up of between 20,000 and 25,000 people are located in the Chittaung Hills of southern Bangladesh. Another 2,000 Mrus inhabit the districts of West Bengal, India.

They cultivate on the hillsides after cutting down the trees, which usually takes a month. This process usually occurs in January or February. Around March, they burn the trees that are taken down for taungya paddy cultivation and they start sowing in April. When they sow the seeds separately in pits, they use spades, which are made with a long handle from an old taungya-cutting-dah (knife) that is no longer usable.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=251}}</ref>\n\n== Traditional rites and rituals ==\n\n=== Birth ===\nAfter the birth of a child, four short bamboos are placed on the bank of the stream.

One of the goats is put in front of the hut closest to the stream and the other near the second hut. The fowls are then placed in between the two huts. After the villagers pray for good health and the abundance of crops for the coming taungya cultivation, both the goats and fowls are slaughtered one after another starting from the goat nearest to the stream. The blood of the animals is then sprayed over the small huts and the flowing water. The villagers then cooked the goats and the fowls are reclaimed by their respective owners. With the meat and ''khaung'', they made an offering to the nat before they begin the feast. Meanwhile, the village is shut down for three days and the villagers fix up bamboo arches over the village path. If anyone enters the village during this time period, a compensation has to be paid to cover all the expenses incurred. This ceremony is celebrated once a year and after the ceremony, they can start their ''taungya'' cultivation for the year.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 253\">{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=253}}</ref>\n\n=== Beginning of Taungya Harvest ===\nAfter the ''taungya'' fruits and vegetables are ready for the harvest, household members go into their ''taungyas'' and collect several different vegetables and fruits with a few plants of paddy. The vegetables and fruits are then put into a big basket and paddy into ''khaung'' pot. A fowl is then killed and its blood sprinkled over the ''khaung'' pot and the vegetable basket. Another fowl is cooked using rice flour and mixing it with salt and ginger. Then the rice is mixed with the ''khaung'' and then together with the fowl, they made an offering in various different baskets to the ''nats'' who live in the staircase of the house. Neighbors are then invited to enjoy the rest of the meat. This ''natpwe'' is held on the same day by different households in a village. Villagers can harvest their produce after the ceremony.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 253\"/>\n\n=== End of Taungya Harvest ===\nAfter all the crops have been harvested, every household kills a pig or two and cooks some pieces of pork in a bamboo tube. The household members then take the meat along with rice and ''khaung'' to their ''taungya''. Once they arrived at their ''taungya'', offerings are made to various nats roaming near the streams close to the ''taungya''. They then pray to the nats for their physical well-being. After they return home, they threw a feast with the rest of the pork and ''khaung''. This ''pwe'' is also celebrated on the same day by all the villagers.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 253\"/>\n\n=== Funeral ===\nUpon the death of a Mro individual, their body is put in a coffin made of split colored bamboos and in some cases rugs and blankets. The body is then cremated and the remaining unburnt pieces of bones are collected; after being stored in the village for 2\u20133 months they are stored in a small hut constructed above the location at which the body was cremated.\n\nIn the case of death by contagious disease (especially small-pox and cholera) the deceased individual is buried immediately and no hut is constructed<ref>{{cite book|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|last=Beniison|first=J.J|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=250}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage law ==\nA man usually discusses with his father about the woman he intends to marry. The father along with his son and a few other villagers visits the house of the prospective bride. They bring three birds, a spear and a ''dah'' (dagger) with them and the spear and the ''dah'' are given to the bride's parents as presents and the fowls for the family to eat. In return, the bride's family cooks pork for the visitors. The visitors must not eat the fowls and the hosts the pork. The bride's father then consults with her daughter and after getting her consent, asks for a dowry. In 1931, it usually consisted of around Rs. 100 and the groom's father may not bargain. After the dowry is settled, the groom's party stays for three days, feasting on ''khaung'' and leaves the next day.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=255}}</ref>\nHowever, in case of a marriage, contracted between the couple without the parental consent, for instance, in a case in which a man elopes with a woman to his parent's house, the parents, with the village elders, return the bride to her parents along with three fowls and ''khaung''. The groom's parents then ask what dowry the bride's parents would like to accept. The dowry, in this case, can be as high as Rs. 100 or as low as Rs. 30. Similar procedures as the one mentioned above take place, except that the groom's family does not stay over for a night but return home with the couple. Then the marriage date is chosen. The bride visits her home occasionally but never returns to live there permanently. If either party breaks the promise of marriage, no action is taken as long as either the bride or the groom claims that one does not love the other. If the bride breaks the promise, half of the dowry has to be returned whereas if the groom breaks the promise, his family loses the dowry. If the husband dies, the heir is entitled to nothing; she has to abandon the issue of marriage, if any, with her father-in-law or a brother-in-law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=208}}</ref>\n\n== Dress ==\n[[File:Mro women working in Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|Mru women working in a village in Bangladesh.

At least one cow or more are sacrificed in devotion to the sacred spirit with the intention of being free from ill or any curse that has been suffered. A full night of dancing and playing ploong takes place and continues onto the next day. After full night of dancing, early in the morning, the cow is killed by a spear. Then its tongue is cut off. The villagers then move to sit on the body of the cow putting a turban on head. Rice beer or alcohol is served during the feast. After cooking the meat and most of the cow all villagers come together and enjoy the feast. There is no fixed time for the ceremony as anybody who affords it can organize it anytime. Guests are allowed to take part. On 28 December 2017, I happened to take the ceremony in Sakoi Commander para (village) of Thanchi with 4 other friends. While attending, I asked an elder Mru in the venue why this cow killing ceremony? He told me a legendary as follows: <nowiki>''</nowiki>Long time ago, almighty summoned Mru people to take their letters. In that time all the people were so busy with work. For bringing the letters, they send a cow. Cow according to their order went, received and then set to move back. On the halfway, the cow felt so hungry and took rest under a fig tree. During then, unconsciously the letter plate was swallowed down into her stomach. On return, the Mru people came to know the story of losing the letters and fired on the cow. The chief of the Mru first hit the mouth, thus all the upper teeth of the cow were broken. While the almighty spirit cross-checked, they complain about the swallowing incident and the spirit asked them to punish the cow by act anything they want to. And that was proclaimed as No Sin. Hence, the angered Mru people decided to kill the cow and then cut off the tongue as punishment. Thus the ceremony started and being regarded as one of the highest ought of all the rituals they follow.

Due to frequent invasions by the Shandu and subsequent colonization by the British, the Ahraing Khami (Khumi) left their homeland. They emigrated to the hilly regions of the Kaladan River headwaters, and to the Pi Chaung and the Mi Chaung streams in the Arakan Hill Tracts where another group of Khami (Khumi), the Mru (Mrucha) and Ahraing Khami (Khumi), lived.

However, the Mru (Mrucha) and Mru ( Awa Khamis) are the oldest tribes living in the region. Together, they form the largest percentage of the population of the approximately 230 square miles Saingdin region.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\" />\nThe two main streams that flow through Saingdin are Re Chaung in the east and Sit Chaung in the west. Both streams originate from the northern part of the region which forms the boundary between Buthidaung Township and the Arakan Hill Tracts. The two streams meander between cliffs for 30 miles before they finally join together near Tharaungchaung village. The two streams flood during the [[monsoon]] season and normally subside after the rains. Water transportation is difficult due to large rocks obstructing the streams. Canoes and bamboo rafts are the only means of transportation to the interior area of the region.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\" />\nOn the sloping banks of the two streams, the Mru (Mrucha) grow tobacco in the alluvial deposits after clearing naturally grown ''kaing'' grass. They also grow paddy, cotton, cane, and bamboo to sell in a weekly bazaar near the waterfall.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 1931, the Saingdin area consists of 90 hamlets and each hamlet contains between two and twenty bamboo houses.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\"/> The population, according to the 1931 Census is 3,390, of which 1,779 are males.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\"/>\nCurrently, about 70,000 Mru (Mrucha) live on the border of Burma with India and Bangladesh. The majority of Mru (Mrucha) people, approximately 12,000, live in Burma within the Yoma District and the Arakan Hill Tracts of western Burma. These figures are, however, just rough estimates as the last census was conducted in 1931 when the country was under the colonial rule. At that time, the total number of Mru (Mrucha) people was estimated around 13,766. Around 200 more villages making up of between 20,000 and 25,000 people are located in the Chittaung Hills of southern Bangladesh. Another 2,000 Mrus inhabit the districts of West Bengal, India.

They cultivate on the hillsides after cutting down the trees, which usually takes a month. This process usually occurs in January or February. Around March, they burn the trees that are taken down for taungya paddy cultivation and they start sowing in April. When they sow the seeds separately in pits, they use spades, which are made with a long handle from an old taungya-cutting-dah (knife) that is no longer usable.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=251}}</ref>\n\n== Traditional rites and rituals ==\n\n=== Birth ===\nAfter the birth of a child, four short bamboos are placed on the bank of the stream.

One of the goats is put in front of the hut closest to the stream and the other near the second hut. The fowls are then placed in between the two huts. After the villagers pray for good health and the abundance of crops for the coming taungya cultivation, both the goats and fowls are slaughtered one after another starting from the goat nearest to the stream. The blood of the animals is then sprayed over the small huts and the flowing water. The villagers then cooked the goats and the fowls are reclaimed by their respective owners. With the meat and ''khaung'', they made an offering to the nat before they begin the feast. Meanwhile, the village is shut down for three days and the villagers fix up bamboo arches over the village path. If anyone enters the village during this time period, a compensation has to be paid to cover all the expenses incurred. This ceremony is celebrated once a year and after the ceremony, they can start their ''taungya'' cultivation for the year.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 253\">{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=253}}</ref>\n\n=== Beginning of Taungya Harvest ===\nAfter the ''taungya'' fruits and vegetables are ready for the harvest, household members go into their ''taungyas'' and collect several different vegetables and fruits with a few plants of paddy. The vegetables and fruits are then put into a big basket and paddy into ''khaung'' pot. A fowl is then killed and its blood sprinkled over the ''khaung'' pot and the vegetable basket. Another fowl is cooked using rice flour and mixing it with salt and ginger. Then the rice is mixed with the ''khaung'' and then together with the fowl, they made an offering in various different baskets to the ''nats'' who live in the staircase of the house. Neighbors are then invited to enjoy the rest of the meat. This ''natpwe'' is held on the same day by different households in a village. Villagers can harvest their produce after the ceremony.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 253\"/>\n\n=== End of Taungya Harvest ===\nAfter all the crops have been harvested, every household kills a pig or two and cooks some pieces of pork in a bamboo tube. The household members then take the meat along with rice and ''khaung'' to their ''taungya''. Once they arrived at their ''taungya'', offerings are made to various nats roaming near the streams close to the ''taungya''. They then pray to the nats for their physical well-being. After they return home, they threw a feast with the rest of the pork and ''khaung''. This ''pwe'' is also celebrated on the same day by all the villagers.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 253\"/>\n\n=== Funeral ===\nUpon the death of a Mru individual, their body is put in a coffin made of split colored bamboos and in some cases rugs and blankets. The body is then cremated and the remaining unburnt pieces of bones are collected; after being stored in the village for 2\u20133 months they are stored in a small hut constructed above the location at which the body was cremated.\n\nIn the case of death by contagious disease (especially small-pox and cholera) the deceased individual is buried immediately and no hut is constructed<ref>{{cite book|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|last=Beniison|first=J.J|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=250}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage law ==\nA man usually discusses with his father about the woman he intends to marry. The father along with his son and a few other villagers visits the house of the prospective bride. They bring three birds, a spear and a ''dah'' (dagger) with them and the spear and the ''dah'' are given to the bride's parents as presents and the fowls for the family to eat. In return, the bride's family cooks pork for the visitors. The visitors must not eat the fowls and the hosts the pork. The bride's father then consults with her daughter and after getting her consent, asks for a dowry. In 1931, it usually consisted of around Rs. 100 and the groom's father may not bargain. After the dowry is settled, the groom's party stays for three days, feasting on ''khaung'' and leaves the next day.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=255}}</ref>\nHowever, in case of a marriage, contracted between the couple without the parental consent, for instance, in a case in which a man elopes with a woman to his parent's house, the parents, with the village elders, return the bride to her parents along with three fowls and ''khaung''. The groom's parents then ask what dowry the bride's parents would like to accept. The dowry, in this case, can be as high as Rs. 100 or as low as Rs. 30. Similar procedures as the one mentioned above take place, except that the groom's family does not stay over for a night but return home with the couple. Then the marriage date is chosen. The bride visits her home occasionally but never returns to live there permanently. If either party breaks the promise of marriage, no action is taken as long as either the bride or the groom claims that one does not love the other. If the bride breaks the promise, half of the dowry has to be returned whereas if the groom breaks the promise, his family loses the dowry. If the husband dies, the heir is entitled to nothing; she has to abandon the issue of marriage, if any, with her father-in-law or a brother-in-law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=208}}</ref>\n\n== Dress ==\n[[File:Mru women working in Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|Mru women working in a village in Bangladesh.

At least one cow or more are sacrificed in devotion to the sacred spirit with the intention of being free from ill or any curse that has been suffered. A full night of dancing and playing ploong takes place and continues onto the next day. After full night of dancing, early in the morning, the cow is killed by a spear. Then its tongue is cut off. The villagers then move to sit on the body of the cow putting a turban on head. Rice beer or alcohol is served during the feast. After cooking the meat and most of the cow all villagers come together and enjoy the feast. There is no fixed time for the ceremony as anybody who affords it can organize it anytime. Guests are allowed to take part. On 28 December 2017, I happened to take the ceremony in Sakoi Commander para (village) of Thanchi with 4 other friends. While attending, I asked an elder Mru in the venue why this cow killing ceremony? He told me a legendary as follows: <nowiki>''</nowiki>Long time ago, almighty summoned Mru people to take their letters. In that time all the people were so busy with work. For bringing the letters, they send a cow. Cow according to their order went, received and then set to move back. On the halfway, the cow felt so hungry and took rest under a fig tree. During then, unconsciously the letter plate was swallowed down into her stomach. On return, the Mru people came to know the story of losing the letters and fired on the cow. The chief of the Mru first hit the mouth, thus all the upper teeth of the cow were broken. While the almighty spirit cross-checked, they complain about the swallowing incident and the spirit asked them to punish the cow by act anything they want to. And that was proclaimed as No Sin.

Fletcher suffered from [[dyspepsia]] and [[obesity]] in his later years, so devised a system of chewing food to maximize digestion.<ref name=\"Skulski 1997\"/> His mastication system became known as \"Fletcherism\". \n\nFletcher and his followers recited and followed his instructions religiously, even claiming that liquids, too, had to be chewed in order to be properly mixed with [[saliva]]. Fletcher argued that his [[Chewing|mastication]] method will increase the amount of strength a person could have while actually decreasing the amount of food that he consumed.<ref>Fletcher, 1913, 20</ref> Fletcher promised that \"Fletcherizing\", as it became known, would turn \"a pitiable glutton into an intelligent [[epicurean]]\".\n\nFletcher also advised against eating before being \"Good and Hungry\", or while angry or sad. Fletcher would claim that knowing exactly what was in the food one consumed was important. He stated that different foods have different waste materials, so knowing what type of waste one was going to have in one\u2019s body was valuable knowledge, thus critical to one\u2019s overall well being (The New Glutton, 1906, 132\u2013133). He promoted his theories for decades on lecture circuits, and became a millionaire. [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Henry James]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]] were among those who gave his ideas a try. Henry James and [[Mark Twain]] were visitors to his palazzo in Venice. He lived in the Palazzo Saibante with his wife, Grace Fletcher, an amateur painter, who studied in Paris in the 1870s and was influenced by the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], and her daughter, Ivy. Ivy, later to become a journalist at the ''Daily Express'' in the 1930s, was often a guinea pig for Horace's experiments, which she described in her unpublished memoirs \"Remember Me\".\n\nFletcher inspired [[Russell Henry Chittenden]] of [[Yale University]] to test the efficacy of his mastication system.<ref>Chittenden, Russell.

The tests included: \u201cdeep-knee bending\u201d, holding out arms horizontally for a length of time, and [[calf raises]] on an intricate machine. Fletcher claimed to lift \u201cthree hundred pounds dead weight three hundred and fifty times with his right calf\u201d.<ref>Fletcher, 25</ref> The tests claim that Fletcher outperformed these Yale athletes in all events and that they were very impressed with his athletic ability at his old age.

He believed that the only true indication of one\u2019s nutrition was evidenced by excreta (Fletcher 142). Fletcher advocated teaching children to examine their excreta as a means for disease prevention (Fletcher 143). If one was in good health and maintained proper nutrition then their excreta, or digestive \"ash\", as Fletcher called it, should be entirely \"inoffensive\". By inoffensive, Fletcher meant that there was no stench and no evidence of bacterial [[decomposition]].<ref>Fletcher 145</ref>\n\nFletcher was an avid spokesman for Belgian Relief and a member of the [[Commission for Relief in Belgium]] in [[World War I]].\n\nFletcher, 69, died of [[bronchitis]]. His message to humanity \u2013 to have an excellent overall health \u2013 was to have a holistic approach. The approach has only three steps:\n\n# Eat only when you have a good appetite\n# Chew the food like pulp and drink that pulp. Do not swallow food.\n# Drink all the liquids and liquid food sip by sip. Do not drink in gulps.\n\n==Reception==\n\nAlthough he acquired many followers, medical experts described Fletcher as a [[Fad diet|food faddist]] and promoter of [[quackery]].<ref name=\"Gratzer 2005\"/><ref name=\"Malmberg 1935\">Malmberg, Carl.

His 1990 solo album, ''[[Up from the Ashes (Don Dokken album)|Up from the Ashes]]'',  spawned two singles, and achieved modest success. He released his second solo album, titled ''[[Solitary (album)|Solitary]]'' in 2008; it was a stylistic departure from his Dokken material.\n\nDon reformed Dokken in the early 1990s and has been continuing on with the band ever since. He is the only remaining original member of Dokken. Don joined forces with TTM Guitars and has his very own Don Dokken Signature Model TTM Guitar.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early success===\nIn the late 1970s, Don Dokken was playing in a [[Los Angeles]]-based band called ''Airborn'', and had the opportunity to reach a record deal in [[Germany]]. After seeing the band ''Xciter'', and future bandmates [[George Lynch (musician)|George Lynch]] and [[Mick Brown (musician)|Mick Brown]], he knew that they would complete the band that would land the record deal. Although Lynch and Brown were not interested in joining forces with him when he first contacted them, he went ahead to Germany. Don, with the help of one of Xciter's songs, did get the record deal, and he finally convinced Lynch and Brown, along with bassist [[Juan Croucier]], to join him in Dokken soon after he received it.\n\nDuring his time in Germany, Dokken befriended the German band [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], and sang with them in rehearsals for their ''[[Blackout (Scorpions album)|Blackout]]'' album while lead vocalist [[Klaus Meine]] was being treated for nodes on his vocal cords.  Don has stated that he recorded scratch vocals for \"No One Like You,\" \"You Give Me All I Need,\" and \"Dynamite.\"[https://soundcloud.com/user-90858124/ryan-june-2018-dokken]  Don has also stated, \"I was just helping Klaus out,\" and \"You'll never hear those (tracks)...because it's not fair to the Scorpions.\"[https://sleazeroxx.com/scorpions-songs-for-blackout-album-with-don-dokken-on-lead-vocals-will-never-be-released/]  Meine recovered and returned to record the album.\n\nIn 1983, America saw the release of the first Dokken album, ''[[Breaking the Chains (Dokken album)|Breaking the Chains]]'' which had a moderate reception. However Juan Croucier left the band to join [[Ratt]]. [[Jeff Pilson]] was brought in for their second release, ''[[Tooth and Nail (Dokken album)|Tooth and Nail]]'', and at this time metal fans and critics began to take notice of the band. Don's strong, melodic vocals, coupled with Lynch's blazing guitar playing, guided Dokken to national fame.\n\n===Solo release===\nIn the late 1980s, however, personal tension between Dokken and Lynch took its toll on the band. In 1988, after the Monsters of Rock Tour and a further platinum album, Don Dokken decided to break up the band and they went on their separate ways. Don Dokken originally wanted to continue on under the Dokken moniker, but since the other three members shared partial ownership over the Dokken name, he was forced to put out his next album under his own name, and it became known as his first solo album. \n\nThe album, titled ''[[Up from the Ashes (Don Dokken album)|Up from the Ashes]]'', was released in 1990, and was very similar to the Dokken catalog. This project was a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] of sorts, made up of guitarists [[John Norum]] (of [[Europe (band)|Europe]] fame) and Billy White (of [[Watchtower (band)|Watchtower]] fame), bassist [[Peter Baltes]] (of [[Accept (band)|Accept]] fame), and drummer [[Mikkey Dee]] (of [[King Diamond]] and [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] and [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]). John Norum's drummer Hempo Hild\u00e9n was initially part of the band but was replaced by Dee before the album was recorded. Baltes had previously been a member of Dokken during the late 1970s for a brief period. Two music videos were made for the singles \"Mirror Mirror\" and \"Stay,\" respectively. Also, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Don spent time as a producer for the metal band [[XYZ (US band)|XYZ]].\n\nHe also made a guest appearance on the German progressive metal band [[Vanden Plas (band)|Vanden Plas]]'s ''[[Spirit of Live]]'' album as the vocalist for their live performance of Dokken's \"Kiss of Death,\" the studio version of which can be found on Vanden Plas's ''Far Off Grace'' album.\n\n===Dokken reunion===\nAround late 1993, Don started to talk with [[Mick Brown (musician)|Mick Brown]], who had recently left [[George Lynch (musician)|George Lynch]]'s new group, [[Lynch Mob (band)|Lynch Mob]]. They joined up with [[Jeff Pilson]], and started to write new songs. In 1994, they sent what they had written to George Lynch, who was impressed with the material. Together, they decided to reunite and tour again. This reunion lasted for three years and resulted in two new Dokken albums, an acoustic live disc, and a full live concert recorded in Japan in 1995.\n \nIn the late-1990s, Dokken once again parted ways with George Lynch, gained guitarist [[Reb Beach]], and later kicked off a new era with guitarist [[John Norum]] after the departure of Reb Beach. That union didn't last long as Norum departed quickly to re-unite with [[Europe (band)|Europe]]. Norum was briefly replaced by Italian guitarist [[Alex De Rosso]] for the live tour [https://web.archive.org/web/20120710051548/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/california/los+angeles/dokken] until Don managed to find a permanent replacement and in 2003 guitarist/lawyer [[Jon Levin]] filled that position where he continues to this day at Don's side.\n\nSince 1994, Dokken has released six studio albums, two live albums, a Greatest Hits album, as well as their first two DVDs. Don Dokken released a new solo album titled ''[[Solitary (album)|Solitary]]'' in 2008 and Dokken released a new album titled ''[[Lightning Strikes Again]]'' during the same year.  On March 1, 2010, the band Dokken's second greatest hits album, aptly titled Greatest Hits, was digitally released to [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon.com]].  The physical album with additional tracks is set to release from [[King Records (Japan)]] on April 21, 2010 and will be available in the United States through [[Cleopatra Records]] at a later date.\n\nOn September 22, 2010, in an interview with BraveWords.com, Don Dokken revealed that he would be undergoing vocal surgery, to correct problems with nodes and tears in his vocal chords. [http://www.bravewords.com/news/146892] February 4, 2011 Anchorage, Alaska was Dokken's first show since surgery. In addition to the vocal chord surgery, Dokken underwent treatment for cancer around the same time. He has since recovered and his voice has seen great improvement over the past few years.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Dokken discography}}\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"60\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]<br><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=don dokken|chart=all}}|title=Don Dokken Album & Song Chart History (Billboard 200)|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>\n! width=\"60\"| [[Sverigetopplistan|SWE]]<br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swedishcharts.com/search.asp?search=Don+Dokken&cat=a|title=swedishcharts.com - Swedish charts portal|publisher=swedishcharts.com|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>\n! width=\"60\"| [[Swiss Music Charts|SWI]]<br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hitparade.ch/search.asp?search=Don+Dokken&cat=a|title=Die Offizielle Schweizer Hitparade und Music Community und Music Community|publisher=hitparade.ch|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>\n|-\n| 1990\n| align=\"left\"| '''''[[Up from the Ashes (Don Dokken album)|Up from the Ashes]]'''''\n* Release date: October 21, 1990\n* Label: [[Geffen Records]]\n| 50\n| 27\n| 38\n|-\n| 2008\n| align=\"left\"| '''''[[Solitary (album)|Solitary]]'''''\n* Release date: October 21, 2008\n* Label: [[self-released]]\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Tribute Albums ===\n* ''[[Hear 'n Aid]] - Stars'' (1986)\n* ''Smoke On The Water - A Tribute To Deep Purple'' (1994) (lead vocals on ''Fireball'')\n* ''Humanary Stew: A Tribute to Alice Cooper'' (1999) (lead vocals on ''Eighteen'')\n* ''Frankie Banali and Friends  - 24/7/365: The Tribute to Led Zeppelin'' (2007) (lead vocals on ''Kashmir'')\n\n=== Other appearances ===\n* ''[[Great White]] - Out of the Night'' (1983)  (backing vocals on ''On Your Knees'')\n* ''Sexist - Demo'' (1983)  (backing vocals)\n* ''[[Twisted Sister]] - [[Come Out and Play (Twisted Sister album)|Come Out and Play]]'' (1985)  (backing vocals)\n* ''[[Herman Rarebell]] - Herman Ze German and Friends ''(1986) (lead vocals on ''I'll Say Goodbye'', ''Destiny'', and ''Hard Sensation'')\n* ''Munetaka Higachi with Dream Castle'' - ''Free World'' (1997) (lead vocals on ''Tell Me True'')\n* ''[[Vanden Plas (band)|Vanden Plas]] - [[Spirit of Live]]'' (2000) (lead vocals on ''Kiss of Death'')\n* ''[[Eizo Sakamoto]] - Shout Drunker'' (2002) (lead vocals on ''Crescent Moon'')\n* ''[[Kelly Keeling]] \u2013 Giving Sight To The Eye'' (2005) (backing vocals)\n* ''Paris Keeling \u2013 End of Ride Revisited'' (2009)  (lead vocals on ''I've Found'')\n* ''United Rockers 4U \u2013 One Family'' (2011) \n* ''Alex De Rosso \u2013 Lions & Lambs'' (2013) (lead vocals on ''Disappear'')\n* ''Herman Rarebell & Friends - Acoustic Fever'' (2013) (lead vocals on ''You Give Me All I Need'')\n* ''[[Herman Rarebell]]'' \u2013 ''Herman\u2019s Scorpions Songs'' (2014) (lead vocals on ''You Give Me All I Need'')\n* ''Wolfpakk (Michael Voss & Mark Sweeney)'' - ''Rise of The Animal'' (2014) (lead vocals on ''Running out of Times'')\n* ''D.H.
