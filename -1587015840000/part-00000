He is best known for his career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), where he played as both a [[shooting guard]] and [[small forward]]. McGrady is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star]], seven-time [[All-NBA]] selection, two-time [[NBA annual scoring champion|NBA scoring champion]], and one-time winner of the [[NBA Most Improved Player Award]]. He was also inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the Class of 2017.\n\nMcGrady [[NBA high school draftees|entered the NBA straight out of high school]] and was selected as the ninth overall pick by the [[Toronto Raptors]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]]. Beginning his career as a low-minute player, he gradually improved his role with the team, eventually forming an exciting duo with his cousin [[Vince Carter]]. In 2000, he left the Raptors for the [[Orlando Magic]], where he became one of the league's most prolific scorers and a candidate for the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]]. In 2004, he was traded to the [[Houston Rockets]], where he paired with center [[Yao Ming]] to help the Rockets become a perennial [[NBA Playoffs|playoff]] team. His final seasons in the NBA were plagued by injuries, and he retired in 2013 following a brief stint with the [[Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles]] of the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] (CBA) and the [[San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nSince retiring, McGrady has worked as a basketball analyst for [[ESPN]]. From April to July 2014, he realized his dream of playing professional [[baseball]], [[Pitcher (baseball)|pitching]] for the [[Sugar Land Skeeters]] of the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nMcGrady was born on May 24, 1979, in [[Bartow, Florida]], to Melanise Williford.<ref name=Reference /> His father was not a part of his everyday life, so Melanise raised McGrady with the help of her mother, Roberta, in [[Auburndale, Florida|Auburndale]].<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web|title=Tracy McGrady Biography|url=https://www.jockbio.com/Bios/McGrady/McGrady_bio.html|publisher=JockBio|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref> As a youth, McGrady played [[high school basketball]] and [[baseball]] at [[Auburndale High School]] for three years before transferring to [[Mt.

American former professional [[basketball]] player. He is best known for his career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), where he played as both a [[shooting guard]] and [[small forward]]. McGrady is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star]], seven-time [[All-NBA]] selection, two-time [[NBA annual scoring champion|NBA scoring champion]], and one-time winner of the [[NBA Most Improved Player Award]]. He was also inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the Class of 2017.\n\nMcGrady [[NBA high school draftees|entered the NBA straight out of high school]] and was selected as the ninth overall pick by the [[Toronto Raptors]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]]. Beginning his career as a low-minute player, he gradually improved his role with the team, eventually forming an exciting duo with his cousin [[Vince Carter]]. In 2000, he left the Raptors for the [[Orlando Magic]], where he became one of the league's most prolific scorers and a candidate for the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]]. In 2004, he was traded to the [[Houston Rockets]], where he paired with center [[Yao Ming]] to help the Rockets become a perennial [[NBA Playoffs|playoff]] team. His final seasons in the NBA were plagued by injuries, and he retired in 2013 following a brief stint with the [[Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles]] of the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] (CBA) and the [[San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nSince retiring, McGrady has worked as a basketball analyst for [[ESPN]]. From April to July 2014, he realized his dream of playing professional [[baseball]], [[Pitcher (baseball)|pitching]] for the [[Sugar Land Skeeters]] of the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nMcGrady was born on May 24, 1979, in [[Bartow, Florida]], to Melanise Williford.<ref name=Reference /> His father was not a part of his everyday life, so Melanise raised McGrady with the help of her mother, Roberta, in [[Auburndale, Florida|Auburndale]].<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web|title=Tracy McGrady Biography|url=https://www.jockbio.com/Bios/McGrady/McGrady_bio.html|publisher=JockBio|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref> As a youth, McGrady played [[high school basketball]] and [[baseball]] at [[Auburndale High School]] for three years before transferring to [[Mt.

The Broncos compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC West|West]] division. The team began play in 1960 as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL) and joined the NFL as part of the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] in 1970. The Broncos are owned by the [[Pat Bowlen]] trust and currently play home games at [[Empower Field at Mile High]] (formerly known as [[Invesco]] Field at Mile High from 2001\u20132010, [[Sports Authority]] Field at Mile High from 2011\u20132017, and Broncos Stadium at Mile High from 2018\u20132019). Prior to that, they played at [[Mile High Stadium]] from 1960 to 2000.\n\nThe Broncos were barely competitive during their 10-year run in the AFL and their first seven years in the NFL.

On the navy blue jerseys, the streak is orange, with an orange collar and white numerals trimmed in orange, while on the road white jerseys, the streak is navy blue, with a thin orange accent strip on both sides, a navy collar and navy numerals trimmed in orange; the helmet facemasks became navy blue.

Croce|Carlo Maria Croce]]. He has been a visiting scientist at both the Center for Molecular Genetics at the [[University of California]], [[San Diego]], and at the [[Scripps Research Institute]].\n\nHe was appointed Assistant Professor at the Medical School of the [[Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]], [[Rome]], in 1995 before moving to Assistant Professor in Virology at the Medical School of the [[University of Ancona]] in 1999.\nBurioni moved to the medical school at the [[Vita-Salute San Raffaele University| Universit\u00e0 Vita-Salute San Raffaele]] in Milan in 2004, first as an Associate Professor and later as Full Professor of Microbiology and Virology.{{R|\"History\"}}\n\n=== 2016 to present day: stand against the antivaccination movement and continuous career ===\nBurioni is an active campaigner against the [[antivaccination]] movement and rose to fame in Italy after an appearance on the TV talk show \"Virus\" in 2016, on the national TV channel [[Rai 2]].{{R|\"ScienceMag\"}} The majority of the segment was given to Red Ronnie, a DJ, and former actress [[Eleonora Brigliadori]], both of whom hold antivaccination positions. Burioni was left with only a few minutes in which to rebut the misinformation. In response, Burioni posted to [[Facebook]] giving his version of the facts. The post was read by over 5 million people in one day. The TV show \"Virus\" was eventually canceled at the end of the season.{{R|\"FalseBalance\"}} Since then he has developed a large following on social media with almost 480,000 followers on Facebook{{R|\"ScienceMag\"}} and over 114,000 followers on [[Twitter]].{{R|\"Twitter\"}}\n\nIn 2017 he authored the book \"Il vaccino non \u00e8 un'opinione: Le vaccinazioni spiegate a chi proprio non le vuole capire\" (\"The vaccine is not an opinion: Vaccinations, explained to those who just do not want to understand them\"){{R|\"Amazon\"}} which won the 2017 Premio Asimov ([[Isaac Asimov Awards|Asimov Award]]), an annual award established by the [[Gran Sasso Science Institute]] of [[L'Aquila]] awarded to books of science dissemination published in Italy during the previous year.{{R|\"ResearchItaly\"|\"LinkedIn\"}}\n\nIn 2018 Burioni, along with several colleagues, created the website Medical Facts. Articles on the site are written by [[Biomedical scientist|medical scientists]], doctors and other [[Health professional|health professionals]] with the intent of promoting news and advice on a range of health issues.{{R|\"ScienceMag\"|\"MedicalFacts\"}}\n\nIn January 2019 Burioni launched a Pact for Science, calling on all Italian political parties to sign on and pledge to follow five points: to support science as a universal value of progress and humanity; to refuse to support or tolerate pseudoscience, pseudomedicine, and any treatments that are not based on scientific and medical evidence; to prevent pseudo-scientists from creating unjustified alarm regarding health care interventions which have been scientifically and medically demonstrated to be safe; to implement programs designed to correctly inform the public about science, using experts in their fields; and to ensure that scientific research is adequately supported in terms of public financing. Many politicians have signed the pledge, including [[Beppe Grillo]], founder of the [[Five Star Movement]], a party which has strong ties to the antivaccination movement.{{R|\"Pact\"|\"Symptoms\"|\"Grillo\"}}\n\n== Approach with antivaccination activists ==\nBurioni is known for his matter-of-fact approach when dealing with antivaccination activists. \"I don't mind being curt with those who spend five minutes on Google and want to teach me about virology, which I have studied for 35 years. Science is no democracy.\" His stance on vaccinations has led to death threats against both himself and his daughter.{{R|\"Curt\"}}\n\n== Response to COVID-19 (Coronavirus) ==\nIn early February 2020, Burioni noted that the [[coronavirus]] was far more dangerous than the common flu and that due to its highly contagious nature, it was important not to underestimate it, but rather deal with it decisively. He further noted the importance of diagnosing cases as quickly as possible and isolating people who were or might get infected.{{R|\"underestimate\"|\"pop\"}} This position led to Burioni being accused of being a fascist and a supporter of the League, a far-right political party.{{R|\"accused\"}} Later the same month, Burioni again emphasised the importance of self-isolation and avoiding crowded places, noting that Italy had so far been unable to limit the rapid spread of the virus.{{R|\"draconian\"}} Burioni has backed the measures taken by the Italian government to halt the spread of [[COVID-19]], calling it an \"indispensable measure\".{{R|\"pop\"|\"indispensable\"}} Due to the Coronavirus outbreak, Burioni released his latest book, ''Virus. La grande sfida'' (''Virus. The Great Challenge'') in March 2020, several months earlier than originally planned. He received criticism on social media for doing this but responded saying that books on the epidemic were needed now in order to help people understand what was happening.{{R|\"Rush\"|\"Virus\"}} In response to the Italian government's plans to relax [[lockdown]] measures from May 4, Burioni said that anyone leaving their homes should be required to wear a mask and have some form of [[contact tracing]]. He further suggested that anyone found to have the virus should be isolated at a hotel or other facility rather than their home, warning that without these measures the virus could spread anew, resulting in having to start the lockdown all over again.{{R|\"tightrope\"}}\n\n==Awards and recognitions==\n*Jano Planco d'Oro Award, December 2017 in [[Rimini]], awarded annually to doctors, dentists, researchers, other health professionals, bodies, associations, or to other persons who have brought prestige to health, promoting the ethical principles of medicine.{{R|\"JanoPlanco\"}}\n*Annual Prize for Medicine of the UNAMSI, National Scientific Medical Union of Information, 11 December 2017.{{R|\"Unamsi\"}}\n*[[Isaac Asimov Awards|Premio Asimov]].

and Professor of [[Microbiology]] and [[Virology]] at the [[Vita-Salute San Raffaele University]], [[Milan]] where he runs a lab developing human monoclonal antibodies against human infectious agents, the study of pathogen-host interplay, and the use of molecular tools in the early diagnosis of infectious diseases.{{R|\"History\"}} Burioni has risen to fame in Italy for his strong stance against the [[antivaccination]] movement.{{R|\"ScienceMag\"}}\n\n== Education, career, and activism ==\n\n=== 1980s to 2004: studies and early career ===\nAfter graduating from the Liceo Classico Raffaello, [[Urbino]], [[Italy]], he received his Medical Degree from the [[Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]] Medical School in Rome and a [[Ph.D.]] in Microbiological Sciences from the [[University of Genoa]].\n\nBurioni attended the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia and the Wistar Institute of the University of Pennsylvania as a visiting student in the laboratory of Dr. [[Hilary Koprowski]] and [[Carlo M. Croce|Carlo Maria Croce]]. He has been a visiting scientist at both the Center for Molecular Genetics at the [[University of California]], [[San Diego]], and at the [[Scripps Research Institute]].\n\nHe was appointed Assistant Professor at the Medical School of the [[Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]], [[Rome]], in 1995 before moving to Assistant Professor in Virology at the Medical School of the [[University of Ancona]] in 1999.\nBurioni moved to the medical school at the [[Vita-Salute San Raffaele University| Universit\u00e0 Vita-Salute San Raffaele]] in Milan in 2004, first as an Associate Professor and later as Full Professor of Microbiology and Virology.{{R|\"History\"}}\n\n=== 2016 to present day: stand against the antivaccination movement and continuous career ===\nBurioni is an active campaigner against the [[antivaccination]] movement and rose to fame in Italy after an appearance on the TV talk show \"Virus\" in 2016, on the national TV channel [[Rai 2]].{{R|\"ScienceMag\"}} The majority of the segment was given to Red Ronnie, a DJ, and former actress [[Eleonora Brigliadori]], both of whom hold antivaccination positions. Burioni was left with only a few minutes in which to rebut the misinformation. In response, Burioni posted to [[Facebook]] giving his version of the facts. The post was read by over 5 million people in one day. The TV show \"Virus\" was eventually canceled at the end of the season.{{R|\"FalseBalance\"}} Since then he has developed a large following on social media with almost 480,000 followers on Facebook{{R|\"ScienceMag\"}} and over 114,000 followers on [[Twitter]].{{R|\"Twitter\"}}\n\nIn 2017 he authored the book \"Il vaccino non \u00e8 un'opinione: Le vaccinazioni spiegate a chi proprio non le vuole capire\" (\"The vaccine is not an opinion: Vaccinations, explained to those who just do not want to understand them\"){{R|\"Amazon\"}} which won the 2017 Premio Asimov ([[Isaac Asimov Awards|Asimov Award]]), an annual award established by the [[Gran Sasso Science Institute]] of [[L'Aquila]] awarded to books of science dissemination published in Italy during the previous year.{{R|\"ResearchItaly\"|\"LinkedIn\"}}\n\nIn 2018 Burioni, along with several colleagues, created the website Medical Facts. Articles on the site are written by [[Biomedical scientist|medical scientists]], doctors and other [[Health professional|health professionals]] with the intent of promoting news and advice on a range of health issues.{{R|\"ScienceMag\"|\"MedicalFacts\"}}\n\nIn January 2019 Burioni launched a Pact for Science, calling on all Italian political parties to sign on and pledge to follow five points: to support science as a universal value of progress and humanity; to refuse to support or tolerate pseudoscience, pseudomedicine, and any treatments that are not based on scientific and medical evidence; to prevent pseudo-scientists from creating unjustified alarm regarding health care interventions which have been scientifically and medically demonstrated to be safe; to implement programs designed to correctly inform the public about science, using experts in their fields; and to ensure that scientific research is adequately supported in terms of public financing. Many politicians have signed the pledge, including [[Beppe Grillo]], founder of the [[Five Star Movement]], a party which has strong ties to the antivaccination movement.{{R|\"Pact\"|\"Symptoms\"|\"Grillo\"}}\n\n== Approach with antivaccination activists ==\nBurioni is known for his matter-of-fact approach when dealing with antivaccination activists. \"I don't mind being curt with those who spend five minutes on Google and want to teach me about virology, which I have studied for 35 years. Science is no democracy.\" His stance on vaccinations has led to death threats against both himself and his daughter.{{R|\"Curt\"}}\n\n== Response to COVID-19 (Coronavirus) ==\nIn early February 2020, Burioni noted that the coronavirus was far more dangerous than the common flu and that due to its highly contagious nature, it was important not to underestimate it, but rather deal with it decisively. He further noted the importance of diagnosing cases as quickly as possible and isolating people who were or might get infected.{{R|\"underestimate\"|\"pop\"}} This position led to Burioni being accused of being a fascist and a supporter of the League, a far-right political party.{{R|\"accused\"}} Later the same month, Burioni again emphasised the importance of self-isolation and avoiding crowded places, noting that Italy had so far been unable to limit the rapid spread of the virus.{{R|\"draconian\"}} Burioni has backed the measures taken by the Italian government to halt the spread of COVID-19, calling it an \"indispensable measure\".{{R|\"pop\"|\"indispensable\"}} Due to the Coronavirus outbreak, Burioni released his latest book, ''Virus. La grande sfida'' (''Virus. The Great Challenge'') in March 2020, several months earlier than originally planned. He received criticism on social media for doing this but responded saying that books on the epidemic were needed now in order to help people understand what was happening.{{R|\"Rush\"|\"Virus\"}} In response to the Italian government's plans to relax [[lockdown]] measures from May 4, Burioni said that anyone leaving their homes should be required to wear a mask and have some form of [[contact tracing]]. He further suggested that anyone found to have the virus should be isolated at a hotel or other facility rather than their home, warning that without these measures the virus could spread anew, resulting in having to start the lockdown all over again.{{R|\"tightrope\"}}\n\n==Awards and recognitions==\n*Jano Planco d'Oro Award, December 2017 in [[Rimini]], awarded annually to doctors, dentists, researchers, other health professionals, bodies, associations, or to other persons who have brought prestige to health, promoting the ethical principles of medicine.{{R|\"JanoPlanco\"}}\n*Annual Prize for Medicine of the UNAMSI, National Scientific Medical Union of Information, 11 December 2017.{{R|\"Unamsi\"}}\n*[[Isaac Asimov Awards|Premio Asimov]].

It was announced and released by Samsung in early 2011. In some markets it is known as '''Samsung Galaxy Next/Pop/NG'''\nIt is currently available in four different colors; steel grey, white, lime and orange. The same device is sold in the United States as the '''Samsung Dart''' exclusively for [[T-Mobile]]. The face buttons were changed to capacitive matching the rest of the Galaxy lineup.\n\nIt was succeeded by the [[Samsung Galaxy Mini 2]], featuring better screen (480x320 high contrast type vs old 320x240), higher clocked processor (600 >> 800 MHz) & drastically improved memory (278 >> 384 MB of RAM; 160 >> 1830 MB of internal storage avail.) over the original, as well as [[Bluetooth]] v3.0, [[Wi-Fi Direct]] & [[Near-field communication|NFC]] support, amongst others.\n\n==Features==\nThe Galaxy Mini is a 3.5G smartphone that offers quad-band [[GSM]] and was announced with two-band [[HSDPA]] (900/2100&nbsp;MHz) at 7.2&nbsp;Mbit/s. \nThe display is a {{convert|3.14|in|abbr=on}}-diagonal TFT LCD with a 240\u00d7320 pixels QVGA resolution supporting up to 256,000 colors.\n\nThe Galaxy Mini is presented as an entry-level smartphone, and is (as of 13 May 2011) one of the cheapest Android phones on the market.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nThe Galaxy Mini originally ran on [[Android Froyo|Android 2.2 \"Froyo\"]], but in May 2011, Samsung announced that the Galaxy Mini (along with other Galaxy models) will get an official upgrade to [[Android Gingerbread|Android 2.3 Gingerbread]]. An official upgrade to Android 2.3.6 (Gingerbread) was released via [[Samsung Kies]] on December 9, 2011 for some mobile operators. The Galaxy Mini can also be flashed with custom ROMs such as [[CyanogenMod]] releases (although not officially supported by Samsung) where it is codenamed ''tass''.

It was announced and released by Samsung in early 2011. In some markets it is known as '''Samsung Galaxy Next/Pop/NG'''\nIt is currently available in four different colors; steel grey, white, lime and orange. The same device is sold in the United States as the '''Samsung Dart''' exclusively for [[T-Mobile]]. The face buttons were changed to capacitive matching the rest of the Galaxy lineup.\n\nIt was succeeded by the [[Samsung Galaxy Mini 2]], featuring better screen (480x320 high contrast type vs old 320x240), higher clocked processor (600 >> 800 MHz) & drastically improved memory (278 >> 384 MB of RAM; 160 >> 1830 MB of internal storage avail.) over the original, as well as [[Bluetooth]] v3.0, [[Wi-Fi Direct]] & [[NFC]] support, amongst others.\n\n==Features==\nThe Galaxy Mini is a 3.5G smartphone that offers quad-band [[GSM]] and was announced with two-band [[HSDPA]] (900/2100&nbsp;MHz) at 7.2&nbsp;Mbit/s. \nThe display is a {{convert|3.14|in|abbr=on}}-diagonal TFT LCD with a 240\u00d7320 pixels QVGA resolution supporting up to 256,000 colors.\n\nThe Galaxy Mini is presented as an entry-level smartphone, and is (as of 13 May 2011) one of the cheapest Android phones on the market.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nThe Galaxy Mini originally ran on [[Android Froyo|Android 2.2 \"Froyo\"]], but in May 2011, Samsung announced that the Galaxy Mini (along with other Galaxy models) will get an official upgrade to [[Android Gingerbread|Android 2.3 Gingerbread]]. An official upgrade to Android 2.3.6 (Gingerbread) was released via [[Samsung Kies]] on December 9, 2011 for some mobile operators. The Galaxy Mini can also be flashed with custom ROMs such as [[CyanogenMod]] releases (although not officially supported by Samsung) where it is codenamed ''tass''. The officially supported version of CyanogenMod on the Galaxy Mini as of August 2012 is CyanogenMod 7.2.
