For a short while at the beginning of the 2000s, Fulham played at Loftus Road whilst their own ground was being re-developed to Premiership standards.|alt=A colour photograph of Craven Cottage football stadium, showing the pitch in the centre of the image, surrounded stands. At the top of the photo, the word 'Fulham' is spelt out in white lettering on the black seats.]]\nThis article shows the record of [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham Football Club]] against each of the Football League clubs they have played against in all four divisions since 1907.\nFulham's first competitive match was against Maidenhead United on September 10th 1898 in the Southern League but by September 3rd 1907 they had been promoted to the Football League Division Two. Their first match was a home defeat by Hull City. Apart from a brief spell of four seasons in Division 3 (S) they stayed in League Division 2 until promoted to the (old) Division One for the first time in 1949. A memorable F.A.Cup run in 1975 saw them play West Ham United in the final at Wembley, losing 0-2. Tough times were ahead in the late '80s/early '90s when they slipped to next to bottom of the old Third Division at one time. But by 2001 Fulham were promoted to the Top Division, The Premiership.\n\nThen followed a decade of top flight football at Craven Cottage in the Premiership, once finishing in 7th place. But it wasn't going to last forever as they were relegated to the new Championship in 2014 for a few seasons, but after being promoted to the Premiership (again) via the play-offs in May 2018, Fulham had a tough time throughout the 2018-2019 season and after two managerial changes, were relegated after that one season in May 2019. The popular ex midfield player Scott Parker was appointed manager in May and the club looks forward to a return to the Premiership, in due course.\n\n==Key==\n*The records include the results of matches played in [[The Football League]] only (1907-2019). Wartime matches are regarded as unofficial and are excluded, as are matches from the abandoned 1939\u201340 season. F.A.Cup games, Championship Play-Off matches and Test Matches are not included, and matches in the [[Southern Football League]] (1899 to 1907) are not included because records are hard to locate.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pre-League |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/history/pre-league |publisher=Fulham Football Club |accessdate=13 November 2012}}</ref>\n*For the sake of simplicity, present-day names are used throughout: for example, results against Ardwick, Small Heath and Woolwich Arsenal are integrated into the records against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], respectively.\n*P = matches played; W = matches won; D = matches drawn; L = matches lost; F = Goals scored; A = Goals conceded; % Performance = percentage of total points won.\n'''Information up to date at the close of the 2018-2019 season and to be updated at end of the following season'''. \n\nFULHAM'S RECORD AGAINST OTHER FOOTBALL LEAGUE CLUBS <ref>Fulham - A Complete Record Dennis Turner & Alex White (updated by David Shrimpton May 2019)</ref>\n\nAlthough formed in 1879, Fulham were not elected to the Football League until 1907. \nThey have played 106 clubs in the Football League since 1907-1908.

For a short while at the beginning of the 2000s, Fulham played at Loftus Road whilst their own ground was being re-developed to Premiership standards.|alt=A colour photograph of Craven Cottage football stadium, showing the pitch in the centre of the image, surrounded stands. At the top of the photo, the word 'Fulham' is spelt out in white lettering on the black seats.]]\nThis article shows the record of [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham Football Club]] against each of the Football League clubs they have played against in all four divisions since 1907.\nFulham's first competitive match was against Maidenhead United on September 10th 1898 in the Southern League but by September 3rd 1907 they had been promoted to the Football League Division Two. Their first match was a home defeat by Hull City. Apart from a brief spell of four seasons in Division 3 (S) they stayed in League Division 2 until promoted to the (old) Division One for the first time in 1949. A memorable F.A.Cup run in 1975 saw them play West Ham United in the final at Wembley, losing 0-2. Tough times were ahead in the late '80s/early '90s when they slipped to next to bottom of the old Third Division at one time. But by 2001 Fulham were promoted to the Top Division, The Premiership.\n\nThen followed a decade of top flight football at Craven Cottage in the Premiership, once finishing in 7th place. But it wasn't going to last forever as they were relegated to the new Championship in 2014 for a few seasons, but after being promoted to the Premiership (again) via the play-offs in May 2018, Fulham had a tough time throughout the 2018-2019 season and after two managerial changes, were relegated after that one season in May 2019. The popular ex midfield player Scott Parker was appointed manager in May and the club looks forward to a return to the Premiership, in due course.\n\n==Key==\n*The records include the results of matches played in [[The Football League]] only (1907-2019).

She has blonde hair and green eyes, wears glasses and is said to be pretty. Her mother, the Spell Lady Atanaqui, died when she was three years old. Natalie's father, a jobless salesman, later marries Natalie's stepmother Julie, who already has a son called Timothy. Natalie and her stepbrother dislike each other. Julie and Tim left London due to the marriage, so that the family live in an English small town whose name is Millennium Green. Natalie's only friend is Jo Carter, the strongest and tallest girl of their school, where Natalie is often teased due to her [[visual impairment]] and perceived as crazy because she owns a spider named Itsy. This animal is kidnapped by Hawk and his followers to receive the opportunity to get disposal of Natalie, but the plan is unsuccessful. During the adventure, Natalie makes friends with the coeval Merlin and K'tanaqui, Lady Atanaqui's hound.\n\n=== Merlin ===\nMerlin is Hawk's downtrodden son. His mother committed suicide when he still was a baby. Hawk regards Merlin as being completely incompetent as Merlin lacks many magical skills (Hawk chose the name \"[[Merlin]]\" to make fun of him). Merlin is linked with a mouse since he did not manage to get associated to a [[Merlin (bird)|merlin]]. He loves computers, a passion his father does not approve of. At the end of the story, Merlin makes his father disappear by transporting in a very successful way. Then Merlin stays in Earthaven to acquaint the Spell Lords with the technology, since a bigger knowledge about computers would help them to understand Oq's system better.\n\n===Hawk===\nHawk is the story's villain. The malicious would-be Spell Lord feverishly looks for a person with magical skills he could abduct and whose pet his [[Northern goshawk|goshawk]] could eat, so that the person would join his spellclave as a thirteenth member and make him become a Spell Lord. Hawk has long, black hair, yellow eyes, wears a hawk feather and always carries about with him a cane with a hawk head as its knob.\n\nHawk caused the death of Merlin's mother by accidentally killing her pet, a sweet little [[Domestic canary|canary]]. She then took a train to the coast and wandered on a high cliff; her dead body was discovered a few days later on the rocks. Afterwards, Merlin was put by his father into the cellar so that Merlin could not elope.\n\nHawk eventually gets imprisoned between the worlds by his own son.\n\n=== Jo Carter ===\nJoanne \"Jo\" Carter is Natalie's best and only friend and a member of the school's [[netball]] team. They became friends after somebody had stolen Natalie's glasses and been struck down by Jo a few moments later. Jo, the most athletic girl in the school, is extremely big, has brown hair dressed like a fringe and possesses, unlike Natalie, very good eyes. She has a little sister named Sarah, a freckled girl who loves to jabber and annoy Tim.\n\nJo convinces Natalie to learn [[inline skating]] and along with Jo's very fat and drooling dog Bilbo she goes out very early in the morning. During the lesson Natalie loses track of Jo and Bilbo as they disappear inside the fog. A little time later, Natalie is ambushed by Hawk and his followers, who inject Natalie with a [[tranquiliser]] to make her fall asleep. Hawk drowns Bilbo in a nearby river. Jo, who cannot free her friend, alerts Natalie's and her own family.\n\nDuring the residual course of the story, Jo and Tim become friends, too. In the end, Jo and her sister are offered a new dog.\n\n=== Mr Marlins ===\nMr Marlins \u2013 first name unrevealed \u2013 is Natalie's father. He drinks much beer and is constantly intoxicated. He used to work as a salesman until he lost his job, so that he always stays at home and mainly spends his time cleaning his prestigious car, which he had not been driving any more since the death of Natalie's mother. There are quite few people whom Mr Marlins has a good relationship to, a fact which will have changed by the end of the tale.\n\n=== Julie Marlins ===\nJulie Marlins is Natalie's stepmother, Mr Marlin's wife and Tim's mother. As she told her son before marrying Mr Marlins, she regards Natalie as a confused little girl and her father as being an unhappy man. Because of this attitude, she mothers Natalie inordinately, by which she neglects her son. The latter fact led to the hostility that rose between Natalie and Tim, whereby Tim behaves more aggressively and teasingly.\n\n=== Tim ===\nTimothy Lockley, \"Tim\" for short, is the stepbrother of Natalie and the son of Julie. He is angry with his mother's second marriage, which forced them to leave London and move to Millennium Green. Tim also detests Natalie and her father, making them responsible for his anger and terrorising his stepsister to get rid of his [[aggressiveness]]. He has made friends with a gang composed of some of his classmates; to enter that group he had to [[Piercing|pierce]] his ear with an earring that looks like a skull. Tim is described to have blonde curls.\n\n== Reception==\n\nThe majority of reviews were positive, for example the [[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]] said the novel was \"Involving and suspenseful,\"<ref name=\"Chicken House\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.doublecluck.com/bookdetails.php?bid=63 |title=Chicken House homepage \u2013 reviewers comments |access-date=11 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208001341/http://www.doublecluck.com/bookdetails.php?bid=63 |archive-date=8 February 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the Voice of Young Advocates \"highly recommended\" it.<ref name=\"Chicken House\"/>\n\nOther positive comments came from [[Jean Ure]] who said Spellfall was, \"A spellbinder!

Clarke & Company|quote=Sir Lachlan Mor became chief. He was called \"Big Lachlan,\" both on account of his size and the greatness of his mind. It is recorded that he was the most accomplished and warlike chief that ever held sway in the castle. This assumption might be owing to the nearness of his time, whilst those remote might grow dim as ages melt away. His military talents were of a high order; his chivalrous character everywhere commanded respect, and his devoted interest in behalf of his people endeared him to all. Historians have written of him in unstinted praise. His reign covers a very interesting period, though varied and much given to tumult.
