By 1917, when both Russian revolutions took place the territory of the actual Azerbaijan had been part of the empire's Transcaucasian administrative region for more than 100 years, alongside the rest of the Transcaucasus, ever since Iran's cession. It was a multinational region of the Russian Empire, where 3 independent states were born later: Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. The population of the latter was in major part Muslims and that is why it is often referred to as Muslim territory when talking about this period of history. After the February revolution of 1917 in Russia on March 22, 1917, the [[Special Transcaucasian Committee]] ''Ozakom'' (short for ''Osobyi Zakavkazskii Komitet'', \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0439 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442) was established  to fill the administrative gap following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|abdication of the Tsar]]. The members of Ozakom were the members of the State Council and representatives of the Armenian, Georgian and Azerbaijan political elite.  Ozakom announced that in the following months the most important issues, i.e. national, religious, agrarian and social, were to be solved by the Transcaucasian Constituent Assembly. In the course of April and May 1917 several Muslim Assemblies took place. Like many ethnic minorities of Transcaucasia, Azeris aimed at secession from Russia after the February Revolution. Two general opinions were expressed by the representatives of the Muslim community (Mammad Hasan Hajinski, [[Mammad Amin Rasulzade]], [[Alimardan Topchubashov]], [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]], and other founders of the future Azerbaijan Democratic Republic): pan-Turkish, meaning joining with Turkey, and federalization (expressed by M. Rasulzade). The Transcaucasian region got an opportunity to decide its destiny, taking the course of federalization. In accordance with the new structure, the Transcaucasian region was to have a fully independent internal policy, leaving to the new Russian government only foreign policy, defense and army, and custom.\n\nAfter the October revolution of 1917 the Transcaucaisan government had to change its policy as Russia was now involved in the Civil War. The Transcaucausians did not accept the Bolshevik revolution. In February, 1918 the Transcaucasian Council (\u201cSejm\u201d) started its work in Tbilisi, and this was the first serious step towards complete independence of the Caucasian nations. The \u201cSejm\u201d consisted of 125 deputies and represented 3 leading parties: Georgian mensheviks (32 deputies), Azerbaijan Muslims (\u201cMussavat\u201d, 30 deputies) and Armenian \u201cdashnaks\u201d (27 deputies). Bolsheviks refused to join the Sejm and established their own government of the local [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] in Baku: the so-called Baku Commune (November 1917{{spaced ndash}}31 July 1918). The Commune was formed by 85 [[Social Revolutionaries]] and [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries|Left Social Revolutionaries]], 48 [[Bolsheviks]], 36 [[Dashnaks]], 18 [[Musavat]]ists and 13 [[Mensheviks]]. [[Stepan Shaumyan]], a Bolshevik, and  [[Prokopius Dzhaparidze]], a leftist SR, were elected Chairmen of the Council of People's Commissioners of the Commune of Baku. \n[[File:Mammad Amin Rasulzade.jpg|left|180px|thumb|A founder and Speaker of the Republic, [[Mammad Amin Rasulzade]] is widely regarded as the national leader of [[Azerbaijan]].]]\n\nThe [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] was degrading after the collapse of the Russian Empire. The Russian forces were substituted by new Armenian bodies, which were not prepared to the war. Given the circumstances, the Transcaucasian Sejm signed the [[Armistice of Erzincan]] with the [[Ottoman Empire]] on December 5, 1917.  On March 3, 1918, the Bolshevik government in Russia signed the Brest-Litovsk Treaty with Germany. One of the terms was the loss of the regions of [[Kars]], [[Batumi]] and [[Ardahan]] to the Ottoman Empire.

However, Parliament was in complicated circumstance, education, the enlightenment of population was crucial factors in its policy. New schools for girls, hospitals in villages, libraries, courses for teachers were founded in different parts of the country by the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The foundation of Baku State University on September 1, 1919, demonstrates that education was an essential factor in the policy of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. Although the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic collapsed, Baku State University played great in gaining freedom again in the future. Parliament started to create an opportunity for a young generation to study abroad in order to increase the number of educated people. 100 students were sent abroad with the help of state fund.http://www.ebooks.az/view/uSjb49G5.pdf\n\n===Domestic===\nPolitical life in the ADR was dominated by the [[Musavat]] Party, the local winner of the [[Constituent Assembly]] elections of 1917.

Throughout its existence from 1918 to 1920, the Republic of Azerbaijan had diplomatic relations with a number of states.

That diplomatic relations be established between the United States of America and the Republic of Azerbaijan.<ref name=\"Bulletin d 1919, pp. 6\"/>\n\nPresident Wilson granted the delegation an audience, at which he displayed a cold and rather unsympathetic attitude.  As the Azerbaijani delegation reported to its Government, Wilson had stated that the Conference did not want to partition the world into small pieces.  Wilson advised Azerbaijan that it would be better for them to develop a spirit of confederation, and that such a confederation of all the peoples of Transcaucasia could receive the protection of some Power on the basis of a mandate granted by the League of Nations.  The Azerbaijani question, Wilson concluded, could not be solved prior to the general settlement of the Russian question.<ref>''Report of the Delegation'', No. 7, June, 1919, Fund of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dossier No. 3, p. 7, as cited in Raevskii, ''\u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u041c\u0443\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e'', p. 53</ref>\n\n[[File:FireTemple1919.jpg|thumb|right|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic postage stamp, 1919]]\nHowever, despite Wilson's attitude, on January 12, 1920, the [[Allied Supreme Council]] extended ''de facto'' recognition to Azerbaijan, along with Georgia, and Armenia.<ref>Prof. Avtandil Menteshashvili, \"From the history of relations of Georgian democratic Republic with Soviet Russia and Entente\". 1918\u20131921.

In particular, these included disputes with the [[First Republic of Armenia]] ([[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], Zangezur (today the Armenian province of [[Syunik Province|Syunik]]), and [[Qazakh]]) and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] ([[Balak\u0259n|Balakan]], [[Zaqatala (rayon)|Zaqatala]], and [[Qakh]]).  The ADR also claimed territories of the [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]] ([[Derbent]]), but they were not as persistent about these claims as they were about the territories they disputed between Armenia and Georgia.\n\n=== Armenian-Azerbaijani war ===\n[[File:Army of Azerbaijan in 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers and officers of the army of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918]]\n[[File:Mexmandarov 1.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Samad bey Mehmandarov]] was a General of the Artillery in Imperial Russian Army before becoming the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic's Minister of Defense.]]\n{{Main|Armenian\u2013Azerbaijani War|Battle of Baku}}\n\nIn the summer of 1918, the Dashnaks, together with the SRs and the Mensheviks, expelled the [[Bolsheviks]], who refused to ask for British support, and founded the [[Centro Caspian Dictatorship]] (1 August 1918{{spaced ndash}}15 September 1918). The CCD was supported by the [[United Kingdom|British]] who sent an expeditionary force to Baku to help the Armenians and the [[Mensheviks]]. The purpose of the British forces (led by  [[Major General]] [[Lionel Dunsterville]], who arrived from [[Persian Empire|Persia]]'s [[Enzeli]] at the head of a 1,000-strong elite force) was to seize the oil fields in Baku ahead of [[Enver Pasha]]'s advancing Turkish troops ([[Army of Islam (Ottoman Empire)|Army of Islam]]) or the [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser]]'s [[German peoples|German]] troops (who were in neighboring Georgia) and to block a Bolshevik consolidation in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]].\n\n[[File:bakuroad.jpg|left|thumb|North Staffords, a contingent of the [[Dunsterforce]], during the [[Battle of Baku]]]]\nThe city of [[Baku]] only became the capital of the Republic in September 1918.\n\nUnable to resist advancing Turkish troops during the [[Battle of Baku]], Dunsterville ordered the evacuation of the city on September 14, after six weeks of occupation, and withdrew to Iran; most of the Armenian population escaped with the British forces. The Ottoman Army of Islam and its Azeri allies, led by [[Nuri Pasha]], entered Baku on September 15 and slaughtered between 10,000 \u2013 20,000 Armenians in retaliation for the March massacre of Muslims.<ref name=\"Swietochowski\"/><ref name=\"hrw\"/><ref name=\"Croissant-15\">Croissant. ''Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict'', p. 15.</ref> The capital of the ADR was finally moved from Ganja to Baku. However, after the [[Armistice of Mudros]] between Great Britain and Turkey on October 30, Turkish troops were replaced by the [[Allies of World War I]]. Headed by British general [[William Montgomery Thomson]], who had declared himself the military governor of Baku, 5,000 [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] soldiers arrived in Baku on November 17, 1918. By General Thomson's order, [[martial law]] was implemented in Baku.\n\n=== Fight for survival ===\n[[File:SV100190-azeri genocide.jpg|thumb|200px|Memorial to Turkish soldiers killed in the Battle of Baku]]\n[[File:1 march days 1918.jpg|thumb|200px|Remains of the editorial offices of the ''Kaspi'' newspaper on [[Baku]]'s Nikolayevskaya Street (modern-day Istiqlaliyyet Street), ruined during the [[March Days]] in 1918]]\n\nThe ADR found itself in a difficult position, hemmed in from the north by advancing [[Denikin]] forces, unfriendly Iran in the south; the British administration was not hostile but indifferent to the plight of Muslims. General Thomson initially did not recognize the Republic {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} but tacitly cooperated with it. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} On April 25, 1919, a violent protest organized by [[Talysh people|Talysh]] workers of pro-Bolshevik orientation exploded in [[Lankaran]] and deposed the [[Provisional Military Dictatorship of Mughan|Mughan Territorial Administration]], a military dictatorship led by Russian colonel V.T. Sukhorukov. On May 15, the Extraordinary Congress of the \"Councils of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies\" of Lankaran district proclaimed the ''[[Mughan Soviet Republic]]''. By mid-1919 the situation in Azerbaijan had more or less stabilized, and British forces left on August 19, 1919.\n\nThis made the ADR pursue a neutral policy with regards to the Russian Civil War. On June 16, 1919, the ADR and Georgia signed a defensive treaty against the White troops of General [[Anton Denikin]]'s [[Volunteer Army]] who were threatening to start an offensive on their borders. Denikin concluded a secret military pact with Armenia. The Republic of Armenia with its forces formed the 7th corps of Denikin's army and gained military support from the White Movement. This fact increased the tension between the ADR and Armenia. However, the war never materialized as by January 1920, Denikin's army was completely defeated by the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|XI Red Army]], which later started to concentrate its troops on Azerbaijan's borders.\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan were engaged in [[Armenian-Azeri war 1918|fighting over Karabakh]] for some part of 1919. The fighting increased in intensity by February 1920 and martial law was introduced in Karabakh, which was enforced by the newly formed National Army, led by general [[Samedbey Mehmandarov]].\n\n== Fall of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (April 1920) ==\n{{Main|Red Army invasion of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan SSR}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe Baku secession in 1918 was a sensitive strike for Soviet Russia, and it caused heavy consequences during the economic warfare.  Moscow's intention to regain control of the vitally necessary region was strong and coherent, and on its way the Soviet government was ready to accept any concession.\n\nIn 1918 and 1919 Soviet Russia rejected all attempts made by the ADR to establish diplomatic relations between the two.  1920 was marked by a diplomatic dispatch which started with a radiogram sent by Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Georgy Chicherin]], which said: \u201cThe government of the Russian Socialist Federative Republic reverts to Azerbaijan with an initiative to immediately launch talks with the Soviet government aiming at acceleration and finishing of the White army bodies in the South of Russia\u201d. In his response, [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]], the head of the Azerbaijan government, insisted on non-interference in the internal affairs of the country. The Soviets considered this position as support rendered by Azerbaijan to the White army led by Denikin, and lobby of the British interests on the Caspian Sea.\n\nIn 1919 the Azerbaijan left parties including the Baku organization of the Russian communist party, \u201cGummet\u201d and \u201cAdalet\u201d, started consolidating and by the end of the year the Azerbaijan Communist Party (ACP) was created.  The ACP held an active agitation campaign in Baku and its region and was supported by Russia.\n\nIn 1920 the Soviet government established a strong relationship with the new Turkish government headed by Mustafa Kemal. The Soviets were ready to supply Turkey with armaments in exchange for Turkish military support in Azerbaijan. Turkey particularly suggested using military bodies formed in Dagestan to occupy Baku and to avoid exploding its petrol storage reservoirs. Turkish support played an important role and attracted to the Bolsheviks the sympathies of the Muslim population in Azerbaijan.\n\nBy March 1920, it was obvious that the economic and political situation in the ADR had reached a crucial point. In accordance with the analysis made by the Bolsheviks the ADR government received weak support from the people and this should have provided success to the operation. [[Vladimir Lenin]] said that the invasion was justified by the fact that [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] could not survive without Baku oil.<ref>[http://www.globalrus.ru/print_this/134413/ Lenin and Caucasus oil] on GlobalRus.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref>[http://www.window2baku.com/001history_3.htm Deliveries of Baku oil to Russia in April-May 1920] \"History of the City of Baku\" {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nAfter a major political crisis, the Fifth Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic resigned on April 1, 1920. In the beginning of April 1920 the [[Russia]]n [[11th Army (RSFSR)|XI Red Army]] reached the border of Azerbaijan and prepared to attack. The official date of the operation is considered April 25, 1920, when the Azerbaijan Communist Party transformed the party's cells into military bodies, which were to take part in the attack. On April 27, 1920, the Provisional Revolutionary Committee with [[Nariman Narimanov]] as chairman was established and issued the ADR Government an ultimatum. The labor military detachments managed to occupy oilfields, state offices, post offices. Police regiments defected to the rebels. To avoid bloodshed, the deputies complied with the demand and the ADR officially ceased to exist on April 28, 1920, giving way to the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Azerbaijan SSR) as its successor state.\n \nThe Red Army, which entered Baku by April 30, 1920, met very little resistance in Baku from Azerbaijani forces, which were tied up on the Karabakh front. The first [[Communist]] government of Azerbaijan consisted almost entirely of native Azerbaijanis from the left factions of the ''Hummat'' and ''Adalat'' parties.<ref name=\"Pipes\">Richard Pipes.

The uprising was crushed by government troops by May 31. Leaders of the ADR either fled to the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], Turkey and Iran, or were captured by the Bolsheviks and executed, including Gen. Selimov, Gen. Sulkevich, Gen.

Other prominent ADR military figures like former Minister of Defense General [[Samedbey Mehmandarov]] and deputy defense minister General [[Ali-Agha Shikhlinski]] (who was called \"the God of Artillery\" ) were at first arrested, but then released two months later thanks to efforts of [[Nariman Narimanov]]. Gen. Mehmandarov and Gen. Shikhlinsky spent their last years teaching in the Azerbaijan SSR military school.\n\nIn the end, \"the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918-20 quickly or easily.

By 1917, when both Russian revolutions took place the territory of the actual Azerbaijan had been part of the empire's Transcaucasian administrative region for more than 100 years, alongside the rest of the Transcaucasus, ever since Iran's cession. It was a multinational region of the Russian Empire, where 3 independent states were born later: Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. The population of the latter was in major part Muslims and that is why it is often referred to as Muslim territory when talking about this period of history. After the February revolution of 1917 in Russia on March 22, 1917, the [[Special Transcaucasian Committee]] ''Ozakom'' (short for ''Osobyi Zakavkazskii Komitet'', \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0439 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442) was established  to fill the administrative gap following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|abdication of the Tsar]]. The members of Ozakom were the members of the State Council and representatives of the Armenian, Georgian and Azerbaijan political elite.  Ozakom announced that in the following months the most important issues, i.e. national, religious, agrarian and social, were to be solved by the Transcaucasian Constituent Assembly. In the course of April and May 1917 several Muslim Assemblies took place. Like many ethnic minorities of Transcaucasia, Azeris aimed at secession from Russia after the February Revolution. Two general opinions were expressed by the representatives of the Muslim community (Mammad Hasan Hajinski, [[Mammad Amin Rasulzade]], [[Alimardan Topchubashov]], [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]], and other founders of the future Azerbaijan Democratic Republic): pan-Turkish, meaning joining with Turkey, and federalization (expressed by M. Rasulzade). The Transcaucasian region got an opportunity to decide its destiny, taking the course of federalization. In accordance with the new structure, the Transcaucasian region was to have a fully independent internal policy, leaving to the new Russian government only foreign policy, defense and army, and custom.\n\nAfter the October revolution of 1917 the Transcaucaisan government had to change its policy as Russia was now involved in the Civil War. The Transcaucausians did not accept the Bolshevik revolution. In February, 1918 the Transcaucasian Council (\u201cSejm\u201d) started its work in Tbilisi, and this was the first serious step towards complete independence of the Caucasian nations. The \u201cSejm\u201d consisted of 125 deputies and represented 3 leading parties: Georgian mensheviks (32 deputies), Azerbaijan Muslims (\u201cMussavat\u201d, 30 deputies) and Armenian \u201cdashnaks\u201d (27 deputies). Bolsheviks refused to join the Sejm and established their own government of the local [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] in Baku: the so-called Baku Commune (November 1917{{spaced ndash}}31 July 1918). The Commune was formed by 85 [[Social Revolutionaries]] and [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries|Left Social Revolutionaries]], 48 [[Bolsheviks]], 36 [[Dashnaks]], 18 [[Musavat]]ists and 13 [[Mensheviks]]. [[Stepan Shaumyan]], a Bolshevik, and  [[Prokopius Dzhaparidze]], a leftist SR, were elected Chairmen of the Council of People's Commissioners of the Commune of Baku. \n[[File:Mammad Amin Rasulzade.jpg|left|180px|thumb|A founder and Speaker of the Republic, [[Mammad Amin Rasulzade]] is widely regarded as the national leader of [[Azerbaijan]].]]\n\nThe [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] was degrading after the collapse of the Russian Empire. The Russian forces were substituted by new Armenian bodies, which were not prepared to the war. Given the circumstances, the Transcaucasian Sejm signed the [[Armistice of Erzincan]] with the [[Ottoman Empire]] on December 5, 1917.  On March 3, 1918, the Bolshevik government in Russia signed the Brest-Litovsk Treaty with Germany. One of the terms was the loss of the regions of [[Kars]], [[Batumi]] and [[Ardahan]] to the Ottoman Empire. The terms of the Treaty revealed a deep conflict between Georgians and Armenians on one side and the Muslims on another.  The peace talks between the Sejm and Turkey started in March, 1918, in Trapezond did not have any results.  \nThe Ottoman Empire delivered an ultimatum to the Sejm with requirements to accept the terms of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty and initiated an attack to occupy the territories of [[Kars]], [[Batumi]] and [[Ardahan]].\n\n[[File:Flag of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan (1918).svg|thumb|First flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic adopted on June 21, 1918, with reference number 144<ref>[http://aghsu.cls.az/front/files/libraries/2374/books/177531451388440.pdf \u0410\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 (1918\u20151920). \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b].

The Musavat and Ittihad parties were accused of [[Pan-Turkism]] by the Bolsheviks and their allies. The Armenian and Muslim militias engaged in armed confrontation, with the formally neutral Bolsheviks tacitly supporting the Armenian side. All the non-Azeri political groups of the city joined the Bolsheviks against the Muslims: Bolsheviks, [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]], Social Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and even the anti-Bolshevik [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadets]] found themselves for the first time on the same side of the barricade because they were all fighting \"for the Russian cause\".

Following the Moslem rising of 18 March, it had to introduce a dictatorship. This rising, instigated by the Mussavat, set the Tartar and Turkish population, led by their reactionary bourgeoisie, against the Soviet, which consisted of Russians with support from the Armenians.

Despite the objections of [[Mammad Amin Rasulzadeh]], Shafi bey Rustambayli, and others, the Parliament decided to surrender the government in order not to cause bloodshed.

However, Parliament was in complicated circumstance, education, the enlightenment of population was crucial factors in its policy. New schools for girls, hospitals in villages, libraries, courses for teachers were founded in different parts of the country by the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The foundation of Baku State University on September 1, 1919, demonstrates that education was an essential factor in the policy of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. Although the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic collapsed, Baku State University played great in gaining freedom again in the future.

Upon its arrival, the Azerbaijani delegation addressed a note to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]], making the following requests:\n::1. That the independence of Azerbaijan be recognized,\n::2. That Wilsonian principles be applied to Azerbaijan,\n::3. That the Azerbaijani delegation be admitted to the Paris Peace Conference,\n::4. That Azerbaijan be admitted to the League of Nations,\n::5. That the United States War Department extend military help to Azerbaijan, and\n::6. That diplomatic relations be established between the United States of America and the Republic of Azerbaijan.<ref name=\"Bulletin d 1919, pp. 6\"/>\n\nPresident Wilson granted the delegation an audience, at which he displayed a cold and rather unsympathetic attitude.  As the Azerbaijani delegation reported to its Government, Wilson had stated that the Conference did not want to partition the world into small pieces.  Wilson advised Azerbaijan that it would be better for them to develop a spirit of confederation, and that such a confederation of all the peoples of Transcaucasia could receive the protection of some Power on the basis of a mandate granted by the League of Nations.  The Azerbaijani question, Wilson concluded, could not be solved prior to the general settlement of the Russian question.<ref>''Report of the Delegation'', No. 7, June, 1919, Fund of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dossier No. 3, p. 7, as cited in Raevskii, ''\u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u041c\u0443\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e'', p. 53</ref>\n\n[[File:FireTemple1919.jpg|thumb|right|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic postage stamp, 1919]]\nHowever, despite Wilson's attitude, on January 12, 1920, the [[Allied Supreme Council]] extended ''de facto'' recognition to Azerbaijan, along with Georgia, and Armenia.<ref>Prof. Avtandil Menteshashvili, \"From the history of relations of Georgian democratic Republic with Soviet Russia and Entente\". 1918\u20131921.

In addition, the consulates of Azerbaijan started operating in Tabriz, Khoy, Anzali, Rasht, Ahar, Mashhad, Batumi, Kiev, Crimea, Ashgabat and elsewhere.

If so, they said, it should be stated clearly, otherwise Iranians would be opposed to calling that republic Azerbaijan.  Consequently, to allay Iranian fears, the Azerbaijani government would accommodatingly use the term Caucasian Azerbaijan in its documents for circulation abroad.}}\n\nOn 16 July 1919, the Council of Ministers [of ADR] appointed Adil Khan Ziatkhan, who had up to that time served as Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, diplomatic representative of Azerbaijan to the court of the Persian King of Kings.<ref>\"\u0412\u043d\u0435\u0448\u043d\u044f\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432 \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0435 1919-\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\", ''\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0432'', No. 6 (37), 1929, p. 94.</ref>  A Persian delegation headed by Seyed Ziaed-Din Tabatai came to Baku, to negotiate transit, tariff, mail, customs, and other such agreements.

In particular, these included disputes with the [[First Republic of Armenia]] ([[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], Zangezur (today the Armenian province of [[Syunik Province|Syunik]]), and [[Qazakh]]) and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] ([[Balak\u0259n|Balakan]], [[Zaqatala (rayon)|Zaqatala]], and [[Qakh]]).  The ADR also claimed territories of the [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]] ([[Derbent]]), but they were not as persistent about these claims as they were about the territories they disputed between Armenia and Georgia.\n\n=== Armenian-Azerbaijani war ===\n[[File:Army of Azerbaijan in 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers and officers of the army of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918]]\n[[File:Mexmandarov 1.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Samad bey Mehmandarov]] was a General of the Artillery in Imperial Russian Army before becoming the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic's Minister of Defense.]]\n{{Main|Armenian\u2013Azerbaijani War|Battle of Baku}}\n\nIn the summer of 1918, the Dashnaks, together with the SRs and the Mensheviks, expelled the [[Bolsheviks]], who refused to ask for British support, and founded the [[Centro Caspian Dictatorship]] (1 August 1918{{spaced ndash}}15 September 1918). The CCD was supported by the [[United Kingdom|British]] who sent an expeditionary force to Baku to help the Armenians and the [[Mensheviks]]. The purpose of the British forces (led by  [[Major General]] [[Lionel Dunsterville]], who arrived from [[Persian Empire|Persia]]'s [[Enzeli]] at the head of a 1,000-strong elite force) was to seize the oil fields in Baku ahead of [[Enver Pasha]]'s advancing Turkish troops ([[Army of Islam (Ottoman Empire)|Army of Islam]]) or the [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser]]'s [[German peoples|German]] troops (who were in neighboring Georgia) and to block a Bolshevik consolidation in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]].\n\n[[File:bakuroad.jpg|left|thumb|North Staffords, a contingent of the [[Dunsterforce]], during the [[Battle of Baku]]]]\nThe city of [[Baku]] only became the capital of the Republic in September 1918.\n\nUnable to resist advancing Turkish troops during the [[Battle of Baku]], Dunsterville ordered the evacuation of the city on September 14, after six weeks of occupation, and withdrew to Iran; most of the Armenian population escaped with the British forces. The Ottoman Army of Islam and its Azeri allies, led by [[Nuri Pasha]], entered Baku on September 15 and slaughtered between 10,000 \u2013 20,000 Armenians in retaliation for the March massacre of Muslims.<ref name=\"Swietochowski\"/><ref name=\"hrw\"/><ref name=\"Croissant-15\">Croissant. ''Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict'', p. 15.</ref> The capital of the ADR was finally moved from Ganja to Baku. However, after the [[Armistice of Mudros]] between Great Britain and Turkey on October 30, Turkish troops were replaced by the [[Allies of World War I]]. Headed by British general [[William Montgomery Thomson]], who had declared himself the military governor of Baku, 5,000 [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] soldiers arrived in Baku on November 17, 1918. By General Thomson's order, [[martial law]] was implemented in Baku.\n\n=== Fight for survival ===\n[[File:SV100190-azeri genocide.jpg|thumb|200px|Memorial to Turkish soldiers killed in the Battle of Baku]]\n[[File:1 march days 1918.jpg|thumb|200px|Remains of the editorial offices of the ''Kaspi'' newspaper on [[Baku]]'s Nikolayevskaya Street (modern-day Istiqlaliyyet Street), ruined during the [[March Days]] in 1918]]\n\nThe ADR found itself in a difficult position, hemmed in from the north by advancing [[Denikin]] forces, unfriendly Iran in the south; the British administration was not hostile but indifferent to the plight of Muslims. General Thomson initially did not recognize the Republic {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} but tacitly cooperated with it. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} On April 25, 1919, a violent protest organized by [[Talysh people|talysh]] workers of pro-Bolshevik orientation exploded in [[Lankaran]] and deposed the [[Provisional Military Dictatorship of Mughan|Mughan Territorial Administration]], a military dictatorship led by Russian colonel V.T. Sukhorukov. On May 15, the Extraordinary Congress of the \"Councils of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies\" of Lankaran district proclaimed the ''[[Mughan Soviet Republic]]''. By mid-1919 the situation in Azerbaijan had more or less stabilized, and British forces left on August 19, 1919.\n\nThis made the ADR pursue a neutral policy with regards to the Russian Civil War. On June 16, 1919, the ADR and Georgia signed a defensive treaty against the White troops of General [[Anton Denikin]]'s [[Volunteer Army]] who were threatening to start an offensive on their borders. Denikin concluded a secret military pact with Armenia. The Republic of Armenia with its forces formed the 7th corps of Denikin's army and gained military support from the White Movement. This fact increased the tension between the ADR and Armenia. However, the war never materialized as by January 1920, Denikin's army was completely defeated by the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|XI Red Army]], which later started to concentrate its troops on Azerbaijan's borders.\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan were engaged in [[Armenian-Azeri war 1918|fighting over Karabakh]] for some part of 1919. The fighting increased in intensity by February 1920 and martial law was introduced in Karabakh, which was enforced by the newly formed National Army, led by general [[Samedbey Mehmandarov]].\n\n== Fall of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (April 1920) ==\n{{Main|Red Army invasion of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan SSR}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe Baku secession in 1918 was a sensitive strike for Soviet Russia, and it caused heavy consequences during the economic warfare.  Moscow's intention to regain control of the vitally necessary region was strong and coherent, and on its way the Soviet government was ready to accept any concession.\n\nIn 1918 and 1919 Soviet Russia rejected all attempts made by the ADR to establish diplomatic relations between the two.  1920 was marked by a diplomatic dispatch which started with a radiogram sent by Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Georgy Chicherin]], which said: \u201cThe government of the Russian Socialist Federative Republic reverts to Azerbaijan with an initiative to immediately launch talks with the Soviet government aiming at acceleration and finishing of the White army bodies in the South of Russia\u201d. In his response, [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]], the head of the Azerbaijan government, insisted on non-interference in the internal affairs of the country. The Soviets considered this position as support rendered by Azerbaijan to the White army led by Denikin, and lobby of the British interests on the Caspian Sea.\n\nIn 1919 the Azerbaijan left parties including the Baku organization of the Russian communist party, \u201cGummet\u201d and \u201cAdalet\u201d, started consolidating and by the end of the year the Azerbaijan Communist Party (ACP) was created.  The ACP held an active agitation campaign in Baku and its region and was supported by Russia.\n\nIn 1920 the Soviet government established a strong relationship with the new Turkish government headed by Mustafa Kemal. The Soviets were ready to supply Turkey with armaments in exchange for Turkish military support in Azerbaijan. Turkey particularly suggested using military bodies formed in Dagestan to occupy Baku and to avoid exploding its petrol storage reservoirs. Turkish support played an important role and attracted to the Bolsheviks the sympathies of the Muslim population in Azerbaijan.\n\nBy March 1920, it was obvious that the economic and political situation in the ADR had reached a crucial point. In accordance with the analysis made by the Bolsheviks the ADR government received weak support from the people and this should have provided success to the operation. [[Vladimir Lenin]] said that the invasion was justified by the fact that [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] could not survive without Baku oil.<ref>[http://www.globalrus.ru/print_this/134413/ Lenin and Caucasus oil] on GlobalRus.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref>[http://www.window2baku.com/001history_3.htm Deliveries of Baku oil to Russia in April-May 1920] \"History of the City of Baku\" {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nAfter a major political crisis, the Fifth Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic resigned on April 1, 1920. In the beginning of April 1920 the [[Russia]]n [[11th Army (RSFSR)|XI Red Army]] reached the border of Azerbaijan and prepared to attack. The official date of the operation is considered April 25, 1920, when the Azerbaijan Communist Party transformed the party's cells into military bodies, which were to take part in the attack. On April 27, 1920, the Provisional Revolutionary Committee with [[Nariman Narimanov]] as chairman was established and issued the ADR Government an ultimatum. The labor military detachments managed to occupy oilfields, state offices, post offices. Police regiments defected to the rebels. To avoid bloodshed, the deputies complied with the demand and the ADR officially ceased to exist on April 28, 1920, giving way to the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Azerbaijan SSR) as its successor state.\n \nThe Red Army, which entered Baku by April 30, 1920, met very little resistance in Baku from Azerbaijani forces, which were tied up on the Karabakh front. The first [[Communist]] government of Azerbaijan consisted almost entirely of native Azerbaijanis from the left factions of the ''Hummat'' and ''Adalat'' parties.<ref name=\"Pipes\">Richard Pipes.

The uprising was crushed by government troops by May 31. Leaders of the ADR either fled to the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], Turkey and Iran, or were captured by the Bolsheviks and executed, including Gen. Selimov, Gen. Sulkevich, Gen. Agalarov: a total of over 20 generals ([[Mammed Amin Rasulzade]] was later allowed to emigrate),<ref name=\"zerbaijan.com\">[http://www.zerbaijan.com/azgenerals.htm List of Azerbaijani Generals and Admirals, Military Leaders and Heroes, May 2006]</ref> or assassinated by Armenian militants like [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]] and Behbudagha Javanshir.<ref name=\"azer.com\">[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/73_folder/73_articles/73_parliamentfate.htm \"The Fate of some of the ADR Parliament Members\", Azerbaijan International (7.3) Autumn 1999]</ref> Most students and citizens travelling abroad remained in those countries, never to return. Other prominent ADR military figures like former Minister of Defense General [[Samedbey Mehmandarov]] and deputy defense minister General [[Ali-Agha Shikhlinski]] (who was called \"the God of Artillery\" ) were at first arrested, but then released two months later thanks to efforts of [[Nariman Narimanov]].

He describes these influences as follows:\n\n{{quote|there was a little disco club there called Le Hibou, which in French means 'the owl.' And it was run by a gentleman named [[Harvey Glatt]], and he brought every, and I mean every, blues star that you or I would ever have wanted to have seen through Ottawa in the late '50s, well I guess more late '60s sort of, in around the Newport jazz rediscovery. I was going to Le Hibou and hearing [[James Cotton]], [[Otis Spann]], [[Pinetop Perkins]], and [[Muddy Waters]]. I actually jammed behind Muddy Waters. S.P. Leary left the drum kit one night, and Muddy said 'anybody out there play drums? I don't have a drummer.' And I walked on stage and we started, I don't know, [[Little Red Rooster]], something. He said 'keep that beat going, you make Muddy feel good.' And I heard [[Howlin' Wolf]] (Chester Burnett). Many, many times I saw Howlin' Wolf. As well as [[the Doors]]. And of course [[Buddy Guy]], Buddy Guy and [[Junior Wells]], [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]]. So I was exposed to all of these players, playing there as part of this scene to service the academic community in Ottawa, a very well-educated community. Had I lived in a different town I don't think that this would have happened, because it was just the confluence of educated government workers, and then also all the colleges in the area, [[University of Ottawa|Ottawa University]], [[Carleton University|Carleton]], and all the schools\u2014these people were interested in blues culture.<ref name=\"AustinSound\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinsound.net/author/roger-gatchet/page/2|title=Still on a mission from God: interview with Dan Aykroyd|author=Roger Gatchet|date=May 18, 2007|publisher=www.austinsound.net|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>This recollection of Aykroyd is subject to challenge.

He was originally hired, and paid $278 a week, as a writer for the show, but became a part of the cast before the series premiered. The original cast was referred to on the show as \"The Not Ready For Prime Time Players\". Aykroyd was the youngest member of the cast, and appeared on the show for its first four seasons, from 1975\u20131979. He brought a unique sensibility to the show, combining youth, unusual interests, talent as an [[impersonator]], and an almost lunatic intensity. Guest host [[Eric Idle]] of [[Monty Python]] said that Aykroyd's ability to write and act out characters flawlessly made him the only member of the ''SNL'' cast capable of being a Python.<ref name=\"snl20050220\">{{cite episode|title=Live from New York: The First 5 Years of Saturday Night Live|series=''SNL''|network=NBC|airdate=2005-02-20}}</ref>\n\nHe was known for his impersonations of celebrities like [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Vincent Price]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Rod Serling]], [[Tom Snyder]], [[Julia Child]], and others. He was also known for his recurring roles, such as Beldar, father of the [[Coneheads]] family; with [[Steve Martin]], Yortuk Festrunk, one of the \"Two Wild and Crazy Guys\" [[Czech Republic|Czech]] brothers; sleazy late-night cable TV host E. Buzz Miller and his cousin, corrupt maker of children's toys and costumes Irwin Mainway (who extolled the virtues and defended the safety of the \"Bag-o-Glass\" toy, perhaps the retail leader of the \"Bag-o\" series of toys); Fred Garvin \u2013 male prostitute; and high-bred but low-brow critic [[Leonard Pinth-Garnell]]. He also co-hosted the [[Weekend Update]] segment for one season with [[Jane Curtin]], known particularly for their point-counterpoint debates enlivened with vicious personal insults including his [[catchphrase]] \"Jane, you ignorant slut\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/point-counterpoint-lee-marvin-and-michelle-triola/2846665|title=Point Counterpoint: Lee Marvin and Michelle Triola|date=March 17, 1979|website=Nbc.com|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAykroyd's eccentric talent was recognized by others in the highly competitive ''SNL'' environment: when he first presented his famous \"Super Bass-O-Matic '76\" sketch, a fake T.V. commercial in which a garish, hyper-pitchman touts a [[blender (device)|food blender]] that turns an entire [[striped bass|bass]] into liquid pulp, \"to [other writers and cast members] the 'Bass-O-Matic' was so exhilaratingly strange that many remember sitting and listening, open-mouthed ... Nobody felt jealous of it because they couldn't imagine writing anything remotely like it.\"<ref>Hill and Weingrad p. 143</ref> While Aykroyd was a close friend and partner with fellow cast member [[John Belushi]] and shared some of the same sensibilities, Aykroyd was more reserved and less self-destructive. Aykroyd later recalled that, unlike Belushi and other of his peers, he was uninterested in recreational drug use.<ref>\"I was never into the powders or pills. I tried it all but didn't like that clenched-teeth feeling. I didn't like the 'I'm a palpitating rabbit and I'm gonna solve the world's problems' feeling either. I drank some beers. I'm still here.\" Sean O'Hagan, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/sep/28/features.review \"I'm still haunted by Belushi\"], ''The Observer''  September 2003)</ref>\n\nIn 1977, he received an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series|Emmy Award]] for writing on ''SNL''; he later received two more nominations for writing and one for acting. In ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 ''Saturday night live'' cast members to date, Aykroyd was ranked fifth (behind Belushi, [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Tina Fey]], and [[Mike Myers]]). \"Of all the original [''SNL''] greats, Aykroyd is the least imitated\", they wrote, \"because nobody else can do what he did.\"<ref>''Rolling Stone'', issue 1229, February 26, 2015, p. 32.</ref>\n\nIn later decades, Aykroyd made occasional guest appearances and unannounced [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]s on ''SNL'', often impersonating the American politician [[Bob Dole]]. He would also bring back past characters including Irwin Mainway and Leonard Pinth-Garnell. In 1995, he appeared on the show to introduce a performance by Canadian rock band [[The Tragically Hip]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rudnick |first1=Natasha |title=The Tragically Hip: 10 Essential Songs |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-tragically-hip-10-essential-songs-97420/grace-too-1994-98177/ |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=28 May 2019 |date=19 August 2016}}</ref> Aykroyd, who is a fan of the band, had personally lobbied [[Lorne Michaels]] to book them as a musical guest.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dan Aykroyd on the Tragically Hip, the blues, ghosts and the Caesar |url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/thursday-may-16-2019-dan-aykroyd-ahmed-best-jar-jar-binks-and-more-from-nunavut-1.5136928/dan-aykroyd-on-the-tragically-hip-the-blues-ghosts-and-the-caesar-1.5137189 |website=CBC Radio |accessdate=28 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring some guest appearances he resurrected [[the Blues Brothers]] musical act with frequent host [[John Goodman]] in place of Belushi. He became the second member of the original cast to host ''SNL'' in May 2003 when he appeared in the season finale. During his monologue, he performed a musical number with [[James Belushi]] similar to the Blues Brothers, but neither Aykroyd nor Belushi donned the famous black suit and sunglasses. On March 24, 2007, Aykroyd appeared as a crying fan of ''[[American Idol]]'' finalist [[Sanjaya Malakar]] (played by [[Andy Samberg]]) during [[Weekend Update]]. On February 14, 2009, he appeared as U.S. House Minority leader [[John Boehner]].

According to Aykroyd, it was their first meeting that helped spark the [[Blues Brothers]] act. When they met in a club that Aykroyd frequented, he played a blues record in the background, and it stimulated a fascination with blues in Belushi, who was primarily a fan of heavy rock bands at the time. Aykroyd educated Belushi on the finer points of blues music and, with a little encouragement from then-''SNL'' music director [[Paul Shaffer]], it led to the creation of their Blues Brothers characters.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Blues Brothers - Soul Man|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/12/the-blues-brothers-soul-man.html|language=en|accessdate=2018-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/making-of-blues-brothers-budget-for-cocaine|title=Making Blues Brothers With John Belushi and Dan Akroyd\u2014\"We Had a Budget for Cocaine\"|last=Zeman|first=Ned|work=HWD|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBacked by such experienced professional R&B sidemen as lead guitarist [[Steve Cropper]], sax man [[Lou Marini]], trumpeter [[Alan Rubin]], and bass guitarist [[Donald \"Duck\" Dunn]], the Blues Brothers proved more than an ''SNL'' novelty. Taking off with the public as a legitimate musical act, they performed live gigs and in 1978 released the hit album ''[[Briefcase Full of Blues]]'' (drawn from the fact that Aykroyd, as \"Elwood Blues\", carried his blues harmonicas in a briefcase that he kept handcuffed to his wrist, in the manner of a CIA courier; Belushi originally carried the key to those handcuffs). ''Briefcase Full of Blues'' eventually sold 3.5 million copies, and is one of the highest-selling blues albums of all time.<ref name=\"AustinSound\" /> The band was much further popularized in the 1980 film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', which Aykroyd co-wrote. A sequel, titled ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', was released in 1998 and featured [[John Goodman]] as Belushi's replacement.\n\n[[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles was a regular haunt for the original Blues Brothers in the early days of the band. Belushi and Aykroyd became fixtures at the recording studio, while fellow Blues Brother Steve Cropper called Cherokee his producing home. Whenever they needed a bass player, they were joined by another Blues Brother, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn. During this time, Cropper, along with producing partner and Cherokee owner [[Bruce Robb (producer)|Bruce Robb]], worked on a number of music projects with the two comedians/musicians, including Belushi's favourite band, [[Fear (band)|Fear]], and later Aykroyd's movie ''Dragnet''.\n\nThe Blues Brothers Band continues to tour today, both with and without Aykroyd. The band features original members Cropper and Marini, along with vocalist [[Eddie Floyd]]. Aykroyd sometimes performs as Elwood, along with Belushi's younger brother [[Jim Belushi]], who plays \"Brother Zee\" on stage. They are most frequently backed by the Sacred Hearts Band.<ref>{{cite web|author=Karen|url=http://www.jimbelushi.ws/jim-sacredhearts.htm|title=Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts|publisher=Jimbelushi.ws|date=January 28, 2011|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Other film and television work==\n{{BLP sources section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Greatoutdoors aykroyd.jpg|thumb|left|Aykroyd (right) on the set of ''[[The Great Outdoors (film)|The Great Outdoors]]'', 1987]]\nConcurrent with his work in ''Saturday Night Live'', Aykroyd played the role of Purvis Bickle, lift operator at the fictitious office block 99 Sumach Street in the [[CBC Television]] series ''[[Coming Up Rosie]]''.\n\nAfter leaving ''Saturday Night Live'', Aykroyd starred in a number of films, mostly comedies, with uneven results both commercially and artistically. His first three American feature films all co-starred Belushi. The first, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' (1979), directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]]. The second, ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), which he co-wrote with director [[John Landis]], was a massive hit. The third, ''[[Neighbors (1981 film)|Neighbors]]'' (1981) had mixed critical reaction but was another box-office hit. One of his best-received performances was as a blueblood-turned-wretch in the 1983 comedy ''[[Trading Places]]'', in which he co-starred with fellow ''SNL'' alumnus [[Eddie Murphy]] as well as [[Jamie Lee Curtis]].\n\nIn the early 1980s, Aykroyd began work on a script for the film that eventually became ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', inspired by his fascination with [[parapsychology]]. The script initially included a much greater fantasy element, including [[time travel]], but this was toned down substantially through work on the script with [[Harold Ramis]] (who became a co-writer) and director [[Ivan Reitman]]. Aykroyd originally wrote the role of Dr. Peter Venkman with Belushi in mind, but rewrote it for [[Bill Murray]] after Belushi's death. Aykroyd joked that the green ghost, later known as \"Slimer\", was \"the ghost of John Belushi\" and was based on Belushi's party animal personality. ''Ghostbusters'' was released in 1984 and became a huge success for Aykroyd, who also appeared as one of the lead actors; the film earned nearly {{US$|300{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}} on a {{US$|30{{nbsp}}million}} budget.\n\nAykroyd's next major film role was in the 1985 spy comedy film ''[[Spies Like Us]]'', which like ''The Blues Brothers'' was co-conceived and co-written by Aykroyd, and directed by Landis. Aykroyd had again intended for Belushi to be the other lead in the film; the part was instead given to ''SNL'' alumnus [[Chevy Chase]]. The film was intended as an homage to the [[Bob Hope]]/[[Bing Crosby]] \"[[Road to ...]]\" movies of the 1940s to 1960s. Bob Hope made a cameo appearance in the film.\n\n1987 saw the release of ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', which Aykroyd co-starred in (with [[Tom Hanks]]) and co-wrote. The film was both an homage and a satire of the [[Dragnet (franchise)|previous ''Dragnet'' series]], with Aykroyd playing Sgt. [[Joe Friday]] as a police officer whose law-and-order attitude is at odds with modern sensibilities.\n\nAykroyd appeared in five films released in 1988, all of them critical and commercial failures. A sequel to ''Ghostbusters'', ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', was released in 1989; Aykroyd and the other co-creators were reluctant to make another ''Ghostbusters'' film but succumbed to pressure from the film's studio, [[Columbia Pictures]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Ghostly Movie|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=May 17, 1987|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-17/entertainment/ca-380_1_david-puttnam|accessdate=November 8, 2010|first=Leonard|last=Klady}}</ref> The film, while considered inferior to the original, was another big hit, earning {{US$|215{{nbsp}}million}}. Aykroyd was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for 1989's ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]''. He was the second ''SNL'' cast member to be nominated for an Oscar, the first being [[Joan Cusack]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAykroyd's [[film director|directorial]] debut was 1991's ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'' starring [[Demi Moore]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[John Candy]] and Aykroyd, sporting a bulbous prosthetic nose. The film was a critical and box office flop. Aykroyd's other films in the 1990s were mostly similarly poorly-received, including ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' (also based on a ''Saturday Night Live'' skit), ''[[Exit to Eden (film)|Exit to Eden]]'', ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', and ''[[Getting Away with Murder (1996 film)|Getting Away with Murder]]''. Two exceptions were ''[[Tommy Boy (film)|Tommy Boy]]'' (1995), which starred ''SNL'' alumni [[David Spade]] and [[Chris Farley]], in which Aykroyd played the role of Ray Zalinsky, and ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'' (1997), in which Aykroyd had a well-received role as a rival hit man.\n\nIn 1994, Aykroyd made a guest appearance in an episode of the sitcom ''[[The Nanny]]'' as a refrigerator repairman. In 1997, he starred as an Episcopal priest in the ABC sitcom ''[[Soul Man (TV series)|Soul Man]]'' which lasted two seasons. In 1998, Aykroyd voiced the role of Chip, a wasp, in ''[[Antz]]''. In 2001, he starred in the [[Woody Allen]] film ''[[The Curse of the Jade Scorpion]]''. Most of his film roles since then have tended to be small character parts in big-budget productions, such as a signals analyst in ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' and a neurologist in ''[[50 First Dates]]''.\n\nIn 2009, Aykroyd and Ramis wrote and appeared in ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'', which also featured Bill Murray, [[Ernie Hudson]], [[Annie Potts]], [[William Atherton]], and [[Brian Doyle-Murray]]. In 2010, he played the voice of the title character, [[Yogi Bear]], in the live-action/CGI-animated-film ''[[Yogi Bear (film)|Yogi Bear]]''. That same year, Aykroyd and Chevy Chase guest starred in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[Spies Reminiscent of Us]]\", an homage to ''Spies Like Us''.\n\nAykroyd appeared in two February 2011 episodes of CBS's ''[[The Defenders (2010 TV series)|The Defenders]]'', which starred Jim Belushi.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Dan-Aykroyd-Defenders-1026196.aspx|title=Dan Aykroyd to Reunite with Jim Belushi on The Defenders|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=November 30, 2010}}</ref> He also appeared on ''Top Chef Canada'' as a guest judge.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/17/AR2011021706507.html|title=TV Highlights: Dan Aykroyd on 'The Defenders'; Dina Lohan on '20/20'; 'Gold Rush: Alaska' finale|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 18, 2011|accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Aykroyd voiced the role of [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] in ''[[Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return]]''.

He describes these influences as follows:\n\n{{quote|there was a little disco club there called Le Hibou, which in French means 'the owl.' And it was run by a gentleman named [[Harvey Glatt]], and he brought every, and I mean every, blues star that you or I would ever have wanted to have seen through Ottawa in the late '50s, well I guess more late '60s sort of, in around the Newport jazz rediscovery. I was going to Le Hibou and hearing [[James Cotton]], [[Otis Spann]], [[Pinetop Perkins]], and [[Muddy Waters]]. I actually jammed behind Muddy Waters. S.P. Leary left the drum kit one night, and Muddy said 'anybody out there play drums? I don't have a drummer.' And I walked on stage and we started, I don't know, [[Little Red Rooster]], something. He said 'keep that beat going, you make Muddy feel good.' And I heard [[Howlin' Wolf]] (Chester Burnett). Many, many times I saw Howlin' Wolf. As well as [[the Doors]]. And of course [[Buddy Guy]], Buddy Guy and [[Junior Wells]], [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]]. So I was exposed to all of these players, playing there as part of this scene to service the academic community in Ottawa, a very well-educated community. Had I lived in a different town I don't think that this would have happened, because it was just the confluence of educated government workers, and then also all the colleges in the area, [[University of Ottawa|Ottawa University]], [[Carleton University|Carleton]], and all the schools\u2014these people were interested in blues culture.<ref name=\"AustinSound\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinsound.net/author/roger-gatchet/page/2|title=Still on a mission from God: interview with Dan Aykroyd|author=Roger Gatchet|date=May 18, 2007|publisher=www.austinsound.net|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>This recollection of Aykroyd is subject to challenge.

He was originally hired, and paid $278 a week, as a writer for the show, but became a part of the cast before the series premiered. The original cast was referred to on the show as \"The Not Ready For Prime Time Players\". Aykroyd was the youngest member of the cast, and appeared on the show for its first four seasons, from 1975\u20131979. He brought a unique sensibility to the show, combining youth, unusual interests, talent as an [[impersonator]], and an almost lunatic intensity. Guest host [[Eric Idle]] of [[Monty Python]] said that Aykroyd's ability to write and act out characters flawlessly made him the only member of the ''SNL'' cast capable of being a Python.<ref name=\"snl20050220\">{{cite episode|title=Live from New York: The First 5 Years of Saturday Night Live|series=''SNL''|network=NBC|airdate=2005-02-20}}</ref>\n\nHe was known for his impersonations of celebrities like [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Vincent Price]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Rod Serling]], [[Tom Snyder]], [[Julia Child]], and others. He was also known for his recurring roles, such as Beldar, father of the [[Coneheads]] family; with [[Steve Martin]], Yortuk Festrunk, one of the \"Two Wild and Crazy Guys\" [[Czech Republic|Czech]] brothers; sleazy late-night cable TV host E. Buzz Miller and his cousin, corrupt maker of children's toys and costumes Irwin Mainway (who extolled the virtues and defended the safety of the \"Bag-o-Glass\" toy, perhaps the retail leader of the \"Bag-o\" series of toys); Fred Garvin \u2013 male prostitute; and high-bred but low-brow critic [[Leonard Pinth-Garnell]]. He also co-hosted the [[Weekend Update]] segment for one season with [[Jane Curtin]], known particularly for their point-counterpoint debates enlivened with vicious personal insults including his [[catchphrase]] \"Jane, you ignorant slut\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/point-counterpoint-lee-marvin-and-michelle-triola/2846665|title=Point Counterpoint: Lee Marvin and Michelle Triola|date=March 17, 1979|website=Nbc.com|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAykroyd's eccentric talent was recognized by others in the highly competitive ''SNL'' environment: when he first presented his famous \"Super Bass-O-Matic '76\" sketch, a fake T.V. commercial in which a garish, hyper-pitchman touts a [[blender (device)|food blender]] that turns an entire [[striped bass|bass]] into liquid pulp, \"to [other writers and cast members] the 'Bass-O-Matic' was so exhilaratingly strange that many remember sitting and listening, open-mouthed ... Nobody felt jealous of it because they couldn't imagine writing anything remotely like it.\"<ref>Hill and Weingrad p. 143</ref> While Aykroyd was a close friend and partner with fellow cast member [[John Belushi]] and shared some of the same sensibilities, Aykroyd was more reserved and less self-destructive. Aykroyd later recalled that, unlike Belushi and other of his peers, he was uninterested in recreational drug use.<ref>\"I was never into the powders or pills. I tried it all but didn't like that clenched-teeth feeling. I didn't like the 'I'm a palpitating rabbit and I'm gonna solve the world's problems' feeling either. I drank some beers. I'm still here.\" Sean O'Hagan, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/sep/28/features.review \"I'm still haunted by Belushi\"], ''The Observer''  September 2003)</ref>\n\nIn 1977, he received an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series|Emmy Award]] for writing on ''SNL''; he later received two more nominations for writing and one for acting. In ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 ''Saturday night live'' cast members to date, Aykroyd was ranked fifth (behind Belushi, [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Tina Fey]], and [[Mike Myers]]). \"Of all the original [''SNL''] greats, Aykroyd is the least imitated\", they wrote, \"because nobody else can do what he did.\"<ref>''Rolling Stone'', issue 1229, February 26, 2015, p. 32.</ref>\n\nIn later decades, Aykroyd made occasional guest appearances and unannounced [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]s on ''SNL'', often impersonating the American politician [[Bob Dole]]. He would also bring back past characters including Irwin Mainway and Leonard Pinth-Garnell. In 1995, he appeared on the show to introduce a performance by Canadian rock band [[The Tragically Hip]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rudnick |first1=Natasha |title=The Tragically Hip: 10 Essential Songs |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-tragically-hip-10-essential-songs-97420/grace-too-1994-98177/ |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=28 May 2019 |date=19 August 2016}}</ref> Aykroyd, who is a fan of the band, had personally lobbied [[Lorne Michaels]] to book them as a musical guest.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dan Aykroyd on the Tragically Hip, the blues, ghosts and the Caesar |url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/thursday-may-16-2019-dan-aykroyd-ahmed-best-jar-jar-binks-and-more-from-nunavut-1.5136928/dan-aykroyd-on-the-tragically-hip-the-blues-ghosts-and-the-caesar-1.5137189 |website=CBC Radio |accessdate=28 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring some guest appearances he resurrected [[the Blues Brothers]] musical act with frequent host [[John Goodman]] in place of Belushi. He became the second member of the original cast to host ''SNL'' in May 2003 when he appeared in the season finale. During his monologue, he performed a musical number with [[James Belushi]] similar to the Blues Brothers, but neither Aykroyd nor Belushi donned the famous black suit and sunglasses. On March 24, 2007, Aykroyd appeared as a crying fan of ''[[American Idol]]'' finalist [[Sanjaya Malakar]] (played by [[Andy Samberg]]) during [[Weekend Update]]. On February 14, 2009, he appeared as U.S. House Minority leader [[John Boehner]]. Aykroyd also made a surprise guest appearance, along with many other ''SNL'' alumni, on the show of March 9, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/justin-timberlake-snl-seth-meyers-429238|title=Seth Meyers Reveals Squabbling Behind Justin Timberlake's 'SNL' (Video)|last=Couch|first=Aaron|date=2013-03-15|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==The Blues Brothers==\n{{main|The Blues Brothers}}\n\nAykroyd was a close friend of [[John Belushi]]. According to Aykroyd, it was their first meeting that helped spark the [[Blues Brothers]] act. When they met in a club that Aykroyd frequented, he played a blues record in the background, and it stimulated a fascination with blues in Belushi, who was primarily a fan of heavy rock bands at the time. Aykroyd educated Belushi on the finer points of blues music and, with a little encouragement from then-''SNL'' music director [[Paul Shaffer]], it led to the creation of their Blues Brothers characters.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Blues Brothers - Soul Man|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/12/the-blues-brothers-soul-man.html|language=en|accessdate=2018-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/making-of-blues-brothers-budget-for-cocaine|title=Making Blues Brothers With John Belushi and Dan Akroyd\u2014\"We Had a Budget for Cocaine\"|last=Zeman|first=Ned|work=HWD|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBacked by such experienced professional R&B sidemen as lead guitarist [[Steve Cropper]], sax man [[Lou Marini]], trumpeter [[Alan Rubin]], and bass guitarist [[Donald \"Duck\" Dunn]], the Blues Brothers proved more than an ''SNL'' novelty. Taking off with the public as a legitimate musical act, they performed live gigs and in 1978 released the hit album ''[[Briefcase Full of Blues]]'' (drawn from the fact that Aykroyd, as \"Elwood Blues\", carried his blues harmonicas in a briefcase that he kept handcuffed to his wrist, in the manner of a CIA courier; Belushi originally carried the key to those handcuffs). ''Briefcase Full of Blues'' eventually sold 3.5 million copies, and is one of the highest-selling blues albums of all time.<ref name=\"AustinSound\" /> The band was much further popularized in the 1980 film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', which Aykroyd co-wrote. A sequel, titled ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', was released in 1998 and featured [[John Goodman]] as Belushi's replacement.\n\n[[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles was a regular haunt for the original Blues Brothers in the early days of the band. Belushi and Aykroyd became fixtures at the recording studio, while fellow Blues Brother Steve Cropper called Cherokee his producing home. Whenever they needed a bass player, they were joined by another Blues Brother, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn. During this time, Cropper, along with producing partner and Cherokee owner [[Bruce Robb (producer)|Bruce Robb]], worked on a number of music projects with the two comedians/musicians, including Belushi's favourite band, [[Fear (band)|Fear]], and later Aykroyd's movie ''Dragnet''.\n\nThe Blues Brothers Band continues to tour today, both with and without Aykroyd. The band features original members Cropper and Marini, along with vocalist [[Eddie Floyd]]. Aykroyd sometimes performs as Elwood, along with Belushi's younger brother [[Jim Belushi]], who plays \"Brother Zee\" on stage. They are most frequently backed by the Sacred Hearts Band.<ref>{{cite web|author=Karen|url=http://www.jimbelushi.ws/jim-sacredhearts.htm|title=Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts|publisher=Jimbelushi.ws|date=January 28, 2011|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Other film and television work==\n{{BLP sources section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Greatoutdoors aykroyd.jpg|thumb|left|Aykroyd (right) on the set of ''[[The Great Outdoors (film)|The Great Outdoors]]'', 1987]]\nConcurrent with his work in ''Saturday Night Live'', Aykroyd played the role of Purvis Bickle, lift operator at the fictitious office block 99 Sumach Street in the [[CBC Television]] series ''[[Coming Up Rosie]]''.\n\nAfter leaving ''Saturday Night Live'', Aykroyd starred in a number of films, mostly comedies, with uneven results both commercially and artistically. His first three American feature films all co-starred Belushi. The first, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' (1979), directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]]. The second, ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), which he co-wrote with director [[John Landis]], was a massive hit. The third, ''[[Neighbors (1981 film)|Neighbors]]'' (1981) had mixed critical reaction but was another box-office hit. One of his best-received performances was as a blueblood-turned-wretch in the 1983 comedy ''[[Trading Places]]'', in which he co-starred with fellow ''SNL'' alumnus [[Eddie Murphy]] as well as [[Jamie Lee Curtis]].\n\nIn the early 1980s, Aykroyd began work on a script for the film that eventually became ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', inspired by his fascination with [[parapsychology]]. The script initially included a much greater fantasy element, including [[time travel]], but this was toned down substantially through work on the script with [[Harold Ramis]] (who became a co-writer) and director [[Ivan Reitman]]. Aykroyd originally wrote the role of Dr. Peter Venkman with Belushi in mind, but rewrote it for [[Bill Murray]] after Belushi's death. Aykroyd joked that the green ghost, later known as \"Slimer\", was \"the ghost of John Belushi\" and was based on Belushi's party animal personality. ''Ghostbusters'' was released in 1984 and became a huge success for Aykroyd, who also appeared as one of the lead actors; the film earned nearly {{US$|300{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}} on a {{US$|30{{nbsp}}million}} budget.\n\nAykroyd's next major film role was in the 1985 spy comedy film ''[[Spies Like Us]]'', which like ''The Blues Brothers'' was co-conceived and co-written by Aykroyd, and directed by Landis. Aykroyd had again intended for Belushi to be the other lead in the film; the part was instead given to ''SNL'' alumnus [[Chevy Chase]]. The film was intended as an homage to the [[Bob Hope]]/[[Bing Crosby]] \"[[Road to ...]]\" movies of the 1940s to 1960s. Bob Hope made a cameo appearance in the film.\n\n1987 saw the release of ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', which Aykroyd co-starred in (with [[Tom Hanks]]) and co-wrote. The film was both an homage and a satire of the [[Dragnet (franchise)|previous ''Dragnet'' series]], with Aykroyd playing Sgt. [[Joe Friday]] as a police officer whose law-and-order attitude is at odds with modern sensibilities.\n\nAykroyd appeared in five films released in 1988, all of them critical and commercial failures. A sequel to ''Ghostbusters'', ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', was released in 1989; Aykroyd and the other co-creators were reluctant to make another ''Ghostbusters'' film but succumbed to pressure from the film's studio, [[Columbia Pictures]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Ghostly Movie|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=May 17, 1987|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-17/entertainment/ca-380_1_david-puttnam|accessdate=November 8, 2010|first=Leonard|last=Klady}}</ref> The film, while considered inferior to the original, was another big hit, earning {{US$|215{{nbsp}}million}}. Aykroyd was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for 1989's ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]''. He was the second ''SNL'' cast member to be nominated for an Oscar, the first being [[Joan Cusack]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAykroyd's [[film director|directorial]] debut was 1991's ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'' starring [[Demi Moore]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[John Candy]] and Aykroyd, sporting a bulbous prosthetic nose. The film was a critical and box office flop. Aykroyd's other films in the 1990s were mostly similarly poorly-received, including ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' (also based on a ''Saturday Night Live'' skit), ''[[Exit to Eden (film)|Exit to Eden]]'', ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', and ''[[Getting Away with Murder (1996 film)|Getting Away with Murder]]''. Two exceptions were ''[[Tommy Boy (film)|Tommy Boy]]'' (1995), which starred ''SNL'' alumni [[David Spade]] and [[Chris Farley]], in which Aykroyd played the role of Ray Zalinsky, and ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'' (1997), in which Aykroyd had a well-received role as a rival hit man.\n\nIn 1994, Aykroyd made a guest appearance in an episode of the sitcom ''[[The Nanny]]'' as a refrigerator repairman. In 1997, he starred as an Episcopal priest in the ABC sitcom ''[[Soul Man (TV series)|Soul Man]]'' which lasted two seasons. In 1998, Aykroyd voiced the role of Chip, a wasp, in ''[[Antz]]''. In 2001, he starred in the [[Woody Allen]] film ''[[The Curse of the Jade Scorpion]]''. Most of his film roles since then have tended to be small character parts in big-budget productions, such as a signals analyst in ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' and a neurologist in ''[[50 First Dates]]''.\n\nIn 2009, Aykroyd and Ramis wrote and appeared in ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'', which also featured Bill Murray, [[Ernie Hudson]], [[Annie Potts]], [[William Atherton]], and [[Brian Doyle-Murray]]. In 2010, he played the voice of the title character, [[Yogi Bear]], in the live-action/CGI-animated-film ''[[Yogi Bear (film)|Yogi Bear]]''. That same year, Aykroyd and Chevy Chase guest starred in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[Spies Reminiscent of Us]]\", an homage to ''Spies Like Us''.\n\nAykroyd appeared in two February 2011 episodes of CBS's ''[[The Defenders (2010 TV series)|The Defenders]]'', which starred Jim Belushi.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Dan-Aykroyd-Defenders-1026196.aspx|title=Dan Aykroyd to Reunite with Jim Belushi on The Defenders|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=November 30, 2010}}</ref> He also appeared on ''Top Chef Canada'' as a guest judge.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/17/AR2011021706507.html|title=TV Highlights: Dan Aykroyd on 'The Defenders'; Dina Lohan on '20/20'; 'Gold Rush: Alaska' finale|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 18, 2011|accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Aykroyd voiced the role of [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] in ''[[Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return]]''.

On his death, the property transferred to his daughter, the then Mrs. David Castleman who eventually built a mansion on the horse farm site and gave it the family name. Under Mr. & Mrs. Castleman, Castleton Farm continued as a Thoroughbred operation, but would add the breeding of [[American Saddlebred]]s as well as [[Standardbred horse|Standardbreds]] for [[harness racing]].\n\nThe original property changed hands several times, occasionally small parts being divied up and sold to multiple different parties. In the early 1890s [[Wall Street]] tycoon [[James R. Keene]] acquired the farm and purchased additional land to bring the operation to almost 1,000 acres (4&nbsp;km\u00b2). Keene usually referred to the farm as \"Castleton Stud\" and under his direction it became one of the greatest Thoroughbred operations of its day.

Keene in 1913, the farm was taken over by his son [[Foxhall P. Keene]]. He continued the operation on a slightly reduced basis but sold it in the 1920s to fellow New Yorker, David Look. Look would have considerable success in harness racing but was forced to sell the farm after experiencing personal financial setbacks during the [[Great Depression]].\n\nIn the early 1940s, heiress [[Frances Dodge]] founded the Dodge Stable. She was the daughter of [[Michigan]] [[automobile]] pioneer [[John Francis Dodge|John F. Dodge]] and a half-sister of [[Isabel Dodge Sloane|Isabel Dodge]], owner of the highly successful [[Brookmeade Stable]]. In 1945, Frances Dodge, with her husband (polo player and hunter/jumper rider) James B. \"Jimmy\" Johnson, purchased Castleton Farm and relocated her Dodge stables there. Their Standardbred  breeding operation included two Hambletonian and a Little Brown Jug  winner.  After she married Pennsylvia native Fredrick Van Lennep in 1949, the farm underwent major renovations in order to breed and raise Standardbreds. The Van Lenneps made Castleton Farm one of the preeminent operations in both disciplines. Under Mrs. Johnson,  Dodge Stables'  show horse [[Wing Commander (horse)|Wing Commander]] became a six-time World Grand Champion and with her husband, she enjoyed enormous success in harness racing that included a number of [[Hambletonian Stakes|Hambletonian]] and [[Little Brown Jug (horse racing)|Little Brown Jug]] victories from horses such as [[United States Harness Horse of the Year]] and [[Harness Racing Museum & Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Victory Song (horse)|Victory Song]] (1947),  [[Hambletonian Stakes]] winners, [[Hoot Mon]] (1947), [[Emily's Pride]] (1958) and [[Speedy Scot]] (1963).

Look would have considerable success in harness racing but was forced to sell the farm after experiencing personal financial setbacks during the [[Great Depression]].\n\nIn the early 1940s, heiress [[Frances Dodge]] founded the Dodge Stable. She was the daughter of [[Michigan]] [[automobile]] pioneer [[John Francis Dodge|John F. Dodge]] and a half-sister of [[Isabel Dodge Sloane|Isabel Dodge]], owner of the highly successful [[Brookmeade Stable]]. In 1945, Frances Dodge, with her husband (polo player and hunter/jumper rider) James B. \"Jimmy\" Johnson, purchased Castleton Farm and relocated her Dodge stables there. Their Standardbred  breeding operation included two Hambletonian and a Little Brown Jug  winner.  After she married Pennsylvia native Fredrick Van Lennep in 1949, the farm underwent major renovations in order to breed and raise Standardbreds. The Van Lenneps made Castleton Farm one of the preeminent operations in both disciplines. Under Mrs. Johnson,  Dodge Stables'  show horse [[Wing Commander (horse)|Wing Commander]] became a six-time World Grand Champion and with her husband, she enjoyed enormous success in harness racing that included a number of [[Hambletonian Stakes|Hambletonian]] and [[Little Brown Jug (horse racing)|Little Brown Jug]] victories from horses such as \"Harness Horse of the Year\" winner Victory Song (1947),  [[Hambletonian Stakes]] winners,  [[Hoot Mon]] (1947), [[Emily's Pride]] (1958) and [[Speedy Scot]] (1963). Among the other noteworthy harness horses bred by Castleton Stud were [[Ensign Hanover]], winner of the 1946 inaugural [[Little Brown Jug (horse race)|Little Brown Jug]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1946/09/19/archives/little-brown-jug-to-johnson-pacer-ensign-hanover-wins-richest-race.html|title=Little Brown Jug To Johnson Pacer |publisher=[[New York Times]], Section Sports, page 43 |date=1946-09-19 |accessdate=2020-01-06}}</ref> and 1972 Jug winner [[Strike Out]] who won in [[world record]] time. Strike Out would go on to sire 1979 winner [[Hot Hitter]] who would be bred by Castleton in conjunction with Anthony Tavolacci.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canadianhorseracinghalloffame.com/1976/11/03/strike-out/ |title=Strike Out |publisher=Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame |date=1976-01-01 |accessdate=2020-01-06}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/21/archives/hot-hitter-prevails-in-little-brown-jug-happy-motoring-beaten-badly.html |title=Hot Hitter Prevails In Little Brown Jug |publisher=[[New York Times]], Section A, page 24 |date=1979-09-21|accessdate=2020-01-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, [[Ireland|Irish]] businessman and racing enthusiast [[Tony Ryan]] acquired Castleton Farm from the Van Lennep Family Trust. Ryan renamed it Castleton Lyons and undertook renovations to the property while returning to its original roots as a Thoroughbred operation.\n\n==Gravesite==\n\nThe Castleton Farm Cemetery lies at an \"intersection of two of the tree-lined farm roads, and is an open green space flanked on one end by a twelve foot high horseshoe-shaped hedge.\" It is not only the final resting spot of a number of Standardbred and Saddlebred mares and stallions, including [[Wing Commander (horse)|Wing Commander]] but also, in unmarked graves, the gravesite for the [[Thoroughbred]] stallions [[Commando (horse)|Commando]] (c. 1898-1905) and [[Kingston (horse)|Kingston]] (c. 1884-1912).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.castletonlyons.com/ Castleton Lyons website]\n* [http://www.tbheritage.com/TurfHallmarks/Graves/cem/GraveMattersCastleton.html TB Heritage Grave Matters Castleton]\n\n{{coord|38.1278|-84.4737|type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:American racehorse owners and breeders]]\n[[Category:Horse farms in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Horse monuments]]\n[[Category:Breckinridge family]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Lexington, Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Lexington, Kentucky]]\n[[Category:American Saddlebred breeders and trainers]]\n[[Category:1793 establishments in Kentucky]]\n", "name_user": "Stretchrunner", "label": "safe", "comment": "links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castleton_Lyons"}
