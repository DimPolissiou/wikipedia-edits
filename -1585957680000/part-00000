The pitch at the Creek was once notorious for its sloping surface but work has been undertaken in recent years to eliminate the slope. With seating and floodlights added since 1980, the club now boasts excellent facilities alongside a spacious clubhouse.\n \nHaving a permanent base enabled the club to apply successfully to join the Somerset Senior League where they were to progress rapidly through the divisions before deciding to advance further to the Western League in 1977.\n \nThe club joined the First Division for the 1977/78 season and remained there until the 1982/83 season when they won the First Division championship and gained promotion to the Premier Division. They remained there until relegation under Pete McCall's management team in 2001/02 but regained their Premier status just two seasons later in 2003/04 under Shaun Bond and Nicky Johns. In 1983/84 they reached the final of the G.F.A. Challenge Trophy where they lost to then Hellenic League side [[Shortwood United]]. The trophy did make its way to the Creek in 1987/88 and has been won on a further three occasions by the club.\n \n \nMain stand at The Creek.\nThe 2011/12 season saw the club win its first double when they took both the GFA Challenge Trophy and the Toolstation League Les Phillips League Cup back to Sea Mills.\n \nLee Lashenko become the new manager at the start of the 2013/14 season and quickly made an impact in the [[FA Cup]], overcoming [[Oldland Abbotonians F.C.|Oldland Abootonians]], [[Lymington Town F.C.|Lymington Town]] and [[Corsham Town]] to reach the Second Qualifying Round, equaling their best ever performance in the competition. Unfortunately, they were unable to go one better and lost to [[Bridgwater Town]] 1-2 in a replay at Fairfax Park. The club continued to fight for top spot in the league and applied for promotion. The club finished second but were unsuccessful in their promotion bid when [[Larkhall Athletic F.C.|Larkhall Athletic]] were accepted into the Southern League. The second-placed finish was the best in the club's history. It also saw the team break the club records for the most goals scored in a season and the fewest goals conceded.\n \nThe 2015/16 season left the club with mixed feelings as on one hand they managed to get to the Quarter-Final of the [[FA Vase]] narrowly going out away to eventual winners [[Morpeth Town]]. On the other hand, whilst they finished 3rd in the Western League, again they just missed out on promotion to the Southern League by one place. They did, however, win the GFA County Challenge Trophy for the second time in succession and the fourth time overall with a record 9-2 win over [[Lydney Town F.C.|Lydney Town]].\n \nIn the 2016/17 season, Bristol Manor Farm were finally successful in gaining promotion to the Southern League, winning the Western League by quite a distance. They also had another successful run in the FA Vase where they went out in the Fifth Round Proper to Semi-Finalists [[Bromsgrove Sporting F.C.|Bromsgrove Sporting]].\n \nThe Farm finished their first season in the eighth tier with a very respectable 9th-place finish, falling away towards the end after troubling the top six places all season.\n\n== Staff ==\n \n*'''First team manager''': Lee Lashenko\n*'''Assistant manager''': Iain Harvey\n*'''Physio''': Stephen Carter\n*'''Coach(s)''': Chris Bailes, Terry Buffrey, [[Mike Mahoney (footballer)|Mike Mahoney]]\n\n== Club rivals ==\nBristol Manor Farm's main rivals are considered to be [[Yate Town F.C.|Yate Town]] and [[Mangotsfield United F.C.|Mangotsfield United]], both from the northern outskirts of Bristol. With all three clubs playing in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League Division One]] since 2017, fixtures among the three have been seen by some fans as a contest to claim the title of Bristol's third club and tend to attract higher than usual attendances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mufc-online.co.uk/teams/32267/match-centre/1-2862155|title=Bristol Manor Farm 3 vs. 1 Mangotsfield

They are currently members of the {{English football updater|BristoMF}} and play at The Creek. The club is affiliated to the [[Gloucestershire County FA]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:The Creek, Bristol Manor Farm.jpg|alt=|thumb|400x400px|Bristol Manor Farm's ground, The Creek, in 2015]]\nBristol Manor Farm Football Club was formed for the 1960/61 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bristolmanorfarm.com/history.php|title=Club History|publisher=Bristol Manor Farm FC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708094805/http://www.bristolmanorfarm.com/history.php|archive-date=2011-07-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> After just one season, the club was disbanded but was reformed and began playing again in the 1962/63 season. Their current home The Creek used to be the site of the Port of Bristol Authority Sports & Social Club but when they moved to new premises 1965, Manor Farm took it over. The pitch at the Creek was once notorious for its sloping surface but work has been undertaken in recent years to eliminate the slope. With seating and floodlights added since 1980, the club now boasts excellent facilities alongside a spacious clubhouse.\n \nHaving a permanent base enabled the club to apply successfully to join the Somerset Senior League where they were to progress rapidly through the divisions before deciding to advance further to the Western League in 1977.\n \nThe club joined the First Division for the 1977/78 season and remained there until the 1982/83 season when they won the First Division championship and gained promotion to the Premier Division. They remained there until relegation under Pete McCall's management team in 2001/02 but regained their Premier status just two seasons later in 2003/04 under Shaun Bond and Nicky Johns. In 1983/84 they reached the final of the G.F.A. Challenge Trophy where they lost to then Hellenic League side [[Shortwood United]]. The trophy did make its way to the Creek in 1987/88 and has been won on a further three occasions by the club.\n \n \nMain stand at The Creek.\nThe 2011/12 season saw the club win its first double when they took both the GFA Challenge Trophy and the Toolstation League Les Phillips League Cup back to Sea Mills.\n \nLee Lashenko become the new manager at the start of the 2013/14 season and quickly made an impact in the [[FA Cup]], overcoming [[Oldland Abbotonians F.C.|Oldland Abootonians]], [[Lymington Town F.C.|Lymington Town]] and [[Corsham Town]] to reach the Second Qualifying Round, equaling their best ever performance in the competition. Unfortunately, they were unable to go one better and lost to [[Bridgwater Town]] 1-2 in a replay at Fairfax Park. The club continued to fight for top spot in the league and applied for promotion. The club finished second but were unsuccessful in their promotion bid when [[Larkhall Athletic F.C.|Larkhall Athletic]] were accepted into the Southern League. The second-placed finish was the best in the club's history. It also saw the team break the club records for the most goals scored in a season and the fewest goals conceded.\n \nThe 2015/16 season left the club with mixed feelings as on one hand they managed to get to the Quarter-Final of the [[FA Vase]] narrowly going out away to eventual winners [[Morpeth Town]]. On the other hand, whilst they finished 3rd in the Western League, again they just missed out on promotion to the Southern League by one place. They did, however, win the GFA County Challenge Trophy for the second time in succession and the fourth time overall with a record 9-2 win over [[Lydney Town F.C.|Lydney Town]].\n \nIn the 2016/17 season, Bristol Manor Farm were finally successful in gaining promotion to the Southern League, winning the Western League by quite a distance. They also had another successful run in the FA Vase where they went out in the Fifth Round Proper to Semi-Finalists [[Bromsgrove Sporting F.C.|Bromsgrove Sporting]].\n \nThe Farm finished their first season in the eighth tier with a very respectable 9th-place finish, falling away towards the end after troubling the top six places all season.\n\n== Staff ==\n \n*'''First team manager''': Lee Lashenko\n*'''Assistant manager''': Iain Harvey\n*'''Physio''': Stephen Carter\n*'''Coach(s)''': Chris Bailes, Terry Buffrey, [[Mike Mahoney (footballer)|Mike Mahoney]]\n\n== Club rivals ==\nBristol Manor Farm's main rivals are considered to be [[Yate Town F.C.|Yate Town]] and [[Mangotsfield United F.C.|Mangotsfield United]], both from the northern outskirts of Bristol. With all three clubs playing in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League Division One]] since 2017, fixtures among the three have been seen by some fans as a contest to claim the title of Bristol's third club and tend to attract higher than usual attendances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mufc-online.co.uk/teams/32267/match-centre/1-2862155|title=Bristol Manor Farm 3 vs. 1 Mangotsfield United - 16 September 2017 - First Team - Mangotsfield United FC \u2122|website=www.mufc-online.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/yatetownfootballclub/teams/97151/match-centre/1-2862485|title=Bristol Manor Farm 1 vs. 1 Yate Town - 24 March 2018 - 1st Team - Yate Town Football Club|website=www.pitchero.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n*'''[[Western Football League]] Premier Division'''<ref name=\"FCHD\">{{Fchd|id=BRISTOMF|name=Bristol Manor Farm}}</ref>\n**Champions: [[2016\u201317 Western Football League#Premier Division|2016-17]]\n**Runners-up: [[2013\u201314 Western Football League#Premier Division|2013-14]]\n*'''[[Western Football League]] Division One'''<ref name=\"FCHD\">{{Fchd|id=BRISTOMF|name=Bristol Manor Farm}}</ref>\n**Champions: [[1982\u201383 Western Football League#First Division|1982\u201383]]\n\n==Cup Honours==\n*'''Gloucestershire Football Association Challenge Trophy'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gloucestershirefa.com/|title=The website for Gloucestershire FA|first=The Football|last=Association|date=|website=www.gloucestershirefa.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n** Winners: 1987-88, 2011\u201312, 2014\u201315, 2015-16<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gloucestershirefa.com/cups/2015-2016/challenge-trophy/results#final|title=Cups & Competitions|first=The Football|last=Association|date=|website=www.gloucestershirefa.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n*'''[[Western Football League]] Cup''':<ref>{{cite web|title=Les Phillips Cup Winners|url=http://www.toolstationleague.com/history2.php|publisher=Toolstation Western League|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n** Winners: 2011-12\n\n==Seasons==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Season\n!Division\n!Pos\n!P\n!W\n!D\n!L\n!F\n!A\n!GD\n!Pts\n!FA Cup\n!FA Trophy\n!FA Vase\n|-\n|[[1977\u201378 Western Football League|1977\u201378]]\n|[[Western Football League|Western Football League Division 1]]\n|4th\n|36\n|20\n|5\n|11\n|67\n|38\n| +29\n|65\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|[[1978\u201379 Western Football League|1978\u201379]]\n|[[Western Football League|Western Football League Division 1]]\n|3rd\n|36\n|20\n|5\n|11\n|59\n|47\n| +12\n|65\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| PR\n|-\n|[[1979\u201380 Western Football League|1979\u201380]]\n|[[Western Football League|Western Football League Division 1]]\n|8th\n|42\n|20\n|9\n|13\n|70\n|58\n| +12\n|49\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| R1\n|-\n|[[1980\u201381 Western Football League|1980\u201381]]\n|[[Western Football League|Western Football League Division 1]]\n|10th\n|36\n|14\n|8\n|14\n|53\n|57\n| \u20134\n|36\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| R1\n|-\n|[[1981\u201382 Western Football League|1981\u201382]]\n|[[Western Football League|Western Football League Division 1]]\n|8th\n|36\n|15\n|9\n|12\n|58\n|50\n| +8\n|39\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| R1\n|-\n|[[1982\u201383 Western Football League|1982\u201383]]\n|[[Western Football League|Western Football League Division 1]]\n|bgcolor=\"gold\"|1st\n|36\n|26\n|7\n|3\n|85\n|31\n| +54\n|59\n| QR2\n| \u2013\n| R3\n|}\n\n==Records==\n*'''[[FA Cup]]'''<ref name=\"FCHD\"/>\n**Third Qualifying Round 2018\u201319, 2019\u201320\n*'''[[FA Trophy]]'''<ref name=\"FCHD\"/>\n**First Qualifying Round 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319\n*'''[[FA Vase]]'''<ref name=\"FCHD\"/>\n**Quarter Finals 2015-16\n*'''Biggest victory'''\n**10\u20130 versus Devizes Town in the Les Phillips Cup.

Between Blaney's 1st year in 1974 and last in 1981, the team went undefeated through league and knockout stages in the various age category competitions. Winning Dalton Cup(74/75)(Blaney captain), Corn na nOg(76/77), Rannefast(78/79) and [[MacRory Cup]](1981). Unfortunately, this team never had the chance to test their mettle on the Irish stage. In this era the only All-Ireland football competition was the final school year but the disparity between school leaving age in Ulster and the other three provinces meant a misalignment of the competition ages. So in 1981, having qualified for the then only All-Ireland college competition, the [[Hogan Cup]], but with the age disparity between Ulster's [[MacRory]](U18 1/2) and the other 3 provinces, Blaney and half a dozen colleagues from this undefeated team were deemed ineligible for the Hogan Cup (U18).<br>\nBlaney's honours while at St. Colman's included helping the school win three [[MacRory Cup]]s<ref name=\"ulster_125\"/> (1978, 1979 and 1981<ref name=\"QUB\"/>).
