Samarth approached Suresh Mullick with the proposal made by Doordarshan to create a film on the unity of India with a planned release date of 15 August 1988. Mullick had previously worked with Kailash Surendranath on the successful national integration film of 1985, ''Torch of Freedom'' (or ''Freedom Run''), and thus chose him to produce the film. Mullick and Surendranath then approached Pandit Bhimsen Joshi who immediately agreed.<ref name=\"CampaignIndiaInterview17\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.campaignindia.in/article/blog-remembering-mile-sur-mera-tumhara-the-song-of-united-india/438921|title=Remembering 'Mile sur mera tumhara', the song of united India|first=Sandeep|last=Goyal|date=14 August 2017|website=Campaign India|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> Mullick decided to fuse together [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] and [[Hindustani classical music]] with modern music for the same, choosing ''Raga Bharavi'' as the base (as per Pandit Joshi's suggestion). The lyrics were written by a young Piyush Pandey and were approved after seventeen other drafts were rejected. Mullick chose Louis Banks and P Vaidyanathan to blend the music correctly and arrange the final score, which was sung by M Balamuralikrishna, Pandit Joshi and Lata Mangeshkar.<ref name=\"FEAnthem07\" />\n\nProducer and director Kailash Surendranath filmed the opening sequence with Pandit Bhimsen Joshi at Pambar Falls in Kodaikanal, where Surendranath had previously filmed a famous ad for [[Liril]] soap (leading to the falls being known popularly as \"Liril Falls\"). With the help of an [[Air Marshal (India)|Air Marshal]] and an [[Indian Air Force|IAF]] helicopter, he shot the aerial view of the Taj Mahal. This led both Surendranath and the Air Marshal in to trouble. The video also features the [[Kolkata Metro]] and the [[Deccan Queen]]. Kamal Hassan's cameo was initially unplanned but he was included only because he accompanied M Balamuralikrishna for the shooting at the beach.<ref name=\"CNTravellerThings18\" /> At the request of Doordarshan, many actors agreed to be a part of the film, with only [[Naseeruddin Shah]] declining. While Kavita Krishnamurthy had recorded most of the initial track for the actresses to [[lip sync]], Lata Mangeshkar made time in her schedule at the last minute and recorded the song in the studio, wearing a [[sari]] with a ''pallu'' ({{trans|drape}}) in the colours of the Indian flag. The last shot of the film, featuring school children, was shot at Mullick's [[alma mater]] in [[Shimla]].<ref name=\"CampaignIndiaInterview17\" />\n\n==Phir Mile Sur Mera Tumhara==\nTwenty years after the tune's debut, it was re-recorded with an updated cast for telecast on 26 January 2010 by [[Zoom (Indian TV channel)|Zoom TV]]. This version, titled \"Phir Mile Sur Mera Tumhara\", features Indian musicians, singers, sportspersons and film personalities from the current generation. The current version's 16 min 17 sec length exceeds the older 6 min 9 sec version and was directed by [[Kailash Surendranath]] who had produced the original version as well. The new version retains music composer/arranger [[Louis Banks]]. It attracted criticism in a large part of the population among them were the [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] community which were upset over the deletion of the Sindhi lines \"Mohnja sur tohi desa pyara mile jadein Geet ashaanjo madhur tarano bane tadein\" present in the original. Further criticism arose over the omission of notable personalities such as, [[A.P.J. Abdul Kalam]], [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and [[Viswanathan Anand]].

The main interest of POEMAS is the observation of [[solar flare]]s in a frequency range where there are very few detectors and fill the gap between [[microwave]]s observed with the [[Radio Solar Telescope Network]] (1 to 15.4&nbsp;GHz) and submillimeter observations of the [[Solar Submillimeter Telescope]] (212 and 405&nbsp;GHz). Moreover, POEMAS is the only current telescope capable of carrying on circular polarization [[solar flare]] observations at 90&nbsp;GHz. (Although, in principle, [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] band 3 may also observe at 90&nbsp;GHz with circular polarization<ref>[http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/about-alma/how-does-alma-work/technology/front-end ALMA Front End]</ref>).\n\n==Science==\n\nPOEMAS was designed to ''fill the gap'' between microwaves and submillimeter (less than 1&nbsp;mm) [[wavelength]] observations of the solar activity. There are a number of different instruments around the world that monitors the sun at microwaves.

The Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP),<ref>[http://solar.nro.nao.ac.jp/norp/ NoRP Official Site]</ref> ([[Nobeyama]], [[Japan]]) is a set of patrol telescopes with receivers from 1&nbsp;GHz (\u03bb\u224830&nbsp;cm) to 80&nbsp;GHz (\u03bb\u22483.7&nbsp;mm) at selected frequencies and circular polarization detection (except at 80&nbsp;GHz) with full sun disk spatial resolution. The [[Radio Solar Telescope Network|Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN)]] is worldwide network of telescopes with receivers at selected bands from few hundred MHz (\u03bb\u224875&nbsp;cm) to 15.4&nbsp;GHz (\u03bb\u22482&nbsp;cm). At the other end of the band, the [[Solar Submillimeter Telescope| Solar Submillimeter Telescope (SST)]] installed at [[Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito]] in [[San Juan Province, Argentina]] observes the sun at 212&nbsp;GHz (\u03bb\u22481.4&nbsp;mm) and 405&nbsp;GHz (\u03bb\u22480.7&nbsp;mm).  Since there is no observational time overlap between Japan and Argentina, the NoRH and NoRP cannot be used together with SST, and only data from some RSTN observatories have times in common with the SST.\n\nThe relevance of observing at 45 and 90&nbsp;GHz comes from the necessity to determine the ''upturn'' frequency in the so-called ''THz events'': if the main radiation mechanism is [[synchrotron radiation]] from accelerated electrons emitting at [[chromosphere|chromospheric]] or [[Stellar corona|corona]]l heights, it is expected a spectrum with a long and descending logarithmic tail towards millimeter wavelengths.  In some cases this classical (''textbook'') shape is broken and an ''upturn'' or ''spectral reversion'' is observed.<ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/603/2/L121/ Kaufmann, P., et al., ''A New Solar Burst Spectral Component Emitting Only in the Terahertz Range'', Astrophys.

The main interest of POEMAS is the observation of [[solar flare]]s in a frequency range where there are very few detectors and fill the gap between [[microwave]]s observed with the [[Radio Solar Telescope Network]] (1 to 15.4&nbsp;GHz) and submillimeter observations of the [[Solar Submillimeter Telescope]] (212 and 405&nbsp;GHz). Moreover, POEMAS is the only current telescope capable of carrying on circular polarization [[solar flare]] observations at 90&nbsp;GHz. (Although, in principle, [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] band 3 may also observe at 90&nbsp;GHz with circular polarization<ref>[http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/about-alma/how-does-alma-work/technology/front-end ALMA Front End]</ref>).\n\n==Science==\n\nPOEMAS was designed to ''fill the gap'' between microwaves and submillimeter (less than 1&nbsp;mm) [[wavelength]] observations of the solar activity. There are a number of different instruments around the world that monitors the sun at microwaves. The [[Nobeyama radio observatory|Nobeyama Radio Heliograph (NoRH)]]<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994IEEEP..82..705N Nakajima, H., et al., Proc. IEEE, 82(5),705, 1994]</ref><ref>Takano, T., et al., ''An Upgrade of Nobeyama Radioheliograph to a Dual-Frequency (17 and 34 GHz) System'', in ''Coronal Physics from Radio and Space Observations''; Proceedings of the CESRA Workshop held in Nouan le Fuzelier, France 3\u20137 June 1996, edited by Gerard Trottet, Published by Springer, p.183,(1997)</ref> ([[Nobeyama]], [[Japan]]) makes daily maps at 17&nbsp;GHz (1.7&nbsp;cm) with circular left and right polarizations and 34&nbsp;GHz (8.8&nbsp;mm), total intensity.  The Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP),<ref>[http://solar.nro.nao.ac.jp/norp/ NoRP Official Site]</ref> ([[Nobeyama]], [[Japan]]) is a set of patrol telescopes with receivers from 1&nbsp;GHz (\u03bb\u224830&nbsp;cm) to 80&nbsp;GHz (\u03bb\u22483.7&nbsp;mm) at selected frequencies and circular polarization detection (except at 80&nbsp;GHz) with full sun disk spatial resolution. The [[Radio Solar Telescope Network|Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN)]] is worldwide network of telescopes with receivers at selected bands from few hundred MHz (\u03bb\u224875&nbsp;cm) to 15.4&nbsp;GHz (\u03bb\u22482&nbsp;cm). At the other end of the band, the [[Solar Submillimeter Telescope| Solar Submillimeter Telescope (SST)]] installed at [[Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito]] in [[San Juan Province, Argentina]] observes the sun at 212&nbsp;GHz (\u03bb\u22481.4&nbsp;mm) and 405&nbsp;GHz (\u03bb\u22480.7&nbsp;mm).  Since there is no observational time overlap between Japan and Argentina, the NoRH and NoRP cannot be used together with SST, and only data from some RSTN observatories have times in common with the SST.\n\nThe relevance of observing at 45 and 90&nbsp;GHz comes from the necessity to determine the ''upturn'' frequency in the so-called ''THz events'': if the main radiation mechanism is [[synchrotron radiation]] from accelerated electrons emitting at [[chromosphere|chromospheric]] or [[corona]]l heights, it is expected a spectrum with a long and descending logarithmic tail towards millimeter wavelengths.  In some cases this classical (''textbook'') shape is broken and an ''upturn'' or ''spectral reversion'' is observed.<ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/603/2/L121/ Kaufmann, P., et al., ''A New Solar Burst Spectral Component Emitting Only in the Terahertz Range'', Astrophys.
