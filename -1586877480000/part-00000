Thereafter, ''Pioneer 11'' became the [[List of artificial objects leaving the Solar System|second of five artificial objects]] to achieve the [[escape velocity]] that will allow them to [[Solar System#Farthest regions|leave the Solar System]]. Due to power constraints and the vast distance to the probe, the last routine contact with the spacecraft was on September 30, 1995, and the last good engineering data was received on November 24, 1995.<ref>http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/missions/archive/pioneer.html</ref><ref name=\"InDepth\">{{cite web|title=Pioneer 11: In Depth|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/pioneer-11/in-depth/|accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Mission background==\n===History===\nApproved in February 1969, ''Pioneer 11'' and its twin probe, ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', were the first to be designed for exploring the [[outer Solar System]]. Yielding to multiple proposals throughout the 1960s, early mission objectives were defined as:\n* Explore the [[interplanetary medium]] beyond the orbit of Mars\n* Investigate the nature of the asteroid belt from the scientific standpoint and assess the belt's possible hazard to missions to the outer planets.\n* Explore the [[Atmosphere of Jupiter|environment of Jupiter]].\n\nSubsequent planning for an encounter with Saturn added many more goals:\n* Map the magnetic field of Saturn and determine its intensity, direction, and structure.\n* Determine how many electrons and protons of various energies are distributed along the trajectory of the spacecraft through the Saturn system.\n* Map the interaction of the Saturn system with the [[solar wind]].\n* Measure the temperature of Saturn's atmosphere and that of Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn.\n* Determine the structure of the upper atmosphere of Saturn where molecules are expected to be electrically charged and form an ionosphere.\n* Map the thermal structure of [[Atmosphere of Saturn|Saturn's atmosphere]] by infrared observations coupled with [[radio occultation]] data.\n* Obtain spin-scan images of the [[Saturnian system]] in two colors during the encounter sequence and polarimetry measurements of the planet.\n* Probe the ring system and the atmosphere of Saturn with S-band radio occultation.\n* Determine more precisely the masses of Saturn and its larger satellites by accurate observations of the effects of their gravitational fields on the motion of the spacecraft.\n* As a precursor to the [[Voyager Program|Mariner Jupiter/Saturn mission]], verify the environment of the ring plane to find out where it may be safely crossed by the Mariner spacecraft without serious damage.<ref>Mark, Hans: [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-349/ch5.htm ''Pioneer Odyssey'' SP-349/396, Chapter 5, NASA-Ames Research Center, 1974]</ref>\n\n''Pioneer 11'' was built by [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] and managed as part of the [[Pioneer program]] by [[NASA Ames Research Center]].<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/missions/archive/pioneer.html NASA - The Pioneer Missions]</ref> A backup unit, [[Pioneer H]], is currently on display in the \"Milestones of Flight\" exhibit at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/gal100/index.cfm#pioneer10|title=Milestones of Flight|publisher=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum}}</ref> Many elements of the mission proved to be critical in the planning of the [[Voyager program|''Voyager'' program]].<ref name=\"burrows\">William E.

Each transceiver is 8 watts and transmits data across the [[S-band]] using 2110 MHz for the uplink from Earth and 2292 MHz for the downlink to Earth with the [[Deep Space Network]] tracking the signal.

They are positioned on two three-rod trusses, each {{convert|3|m|ftin|abbr=off|sp=us}} in length and 120 degrees apart. This was expected to be a safe distance from the sensitive scientific experiments carried on board. Combined, the RTGs provided 155 watts at launch, and decayed to 140 W in transit to Jupiter.

The spacecraft includes two command decoders and a command distribution unit, a very limited form of a processor, to direct operations on the spacecraft. This system requires that mission operators prepare commands long in advance of transmitting them to the probe. A data storage unit is included to record up to 6,144 [[bytes]] of information gathered by the instruments. The digital telemetry unit is then be used to prepare the collected data in one of the thirteen possible formats before transmitting it back to Earth.<ref name=\"PionOdys\"/>{{rp|38}}\n\n====Scientific instruments====\nPioneer 11 has one additional instrument more than Pioneer 10, a flux-gate magnetometer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://solarviews.com/eng/pn10-11.htm|title=Pioneer 10 & 11|website=solarviews.com|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: left\"  | Helium Vector [[Magnetometer]] ('''HVM''')\n|-\n| [[File:Pioneer 10-11 - P50 - fx.jpg|150px]]\n|Measures the fine structure of the interplanetary magnetic field, mapped the Jovian magnetic field, and provides magnetic field measurements to evaluate solar wind interaction with Jupiter.<ref name=\"NSSDCHVM\">{{cite web |url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-019A-08|title= Magnetic Fields|publisher= NASA / National Space Science Data Center|accessdate= 2011-02-19}}</ref>\n* {{small|'''Principal investigator:''' Edward Smith / JPL}}\n* {{small|1='''Data:''' [http://pds-ppi.igpp.ucla.edu/search/?filter=PN_5001,PN_6001&title=Pioneer_11_Helium_Vector_Magnetometer PDS/PPI data catalog], [ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/pioneer/pioneer11/mag/ NSSDC data archive]}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: left\"  | Quadrispherical [[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] Analyzer\n|-\n| [[File:Pioneer 10-11 - P51b - fx.jpg|150px]]\n|Peer through a hole in the large dish-shaped antenna to detect particles of the solar wind originating from the Sun.<ref name=\"NSSDCQPA\">{{cite web |url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1972-012A-13|title= Quadrispherical Plasma Analyzer|publisher= NASA / National Space Science Data Center|accessdate= 2011-02-19}}</ref>\n* {{small|'''Principal investigator:''' Aaron Barnes / NASA Ames Research Center ([https://web.archive.org/web/20000520044455/http://arwen.arc.nasa.gov/ archived website])}}{{sfn|Simpson|2001|p=146}}\n* {{small|1='''Data:''' [http://pds-ppi.igpp.ucla.edu/search/?filter=PN_5001,PN_6001&title=Pioneer_11_Quadrispherical_Plasma_Analyser PDS/PPI data catalog], [ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/pioneer/pioneer11/plasma/ NSSDC data archive]}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: left\"  | [[Charged Particle]] Instrument ('''CPI''')\n|-\n| [[File:Pioneer 10-11 - P52a - fx.jpg|150px]]\n|Detects cosmic rays in the Solar System.<ref name=\"NSSDCCPI\">{{cite web |url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1972-012A-02|title= Charged Particle Instrument (CPI)|publisher= NASA / National Space Science Data Center|accessdate= 2011-02-19}}</ref>\n* {{small|'''Principal investigator:''' [[John Alexander Simpson|John Simpson]] / University of Chicago}}{{sfn|Simpson|2001|p=146}}\n* {{small|'''Data:''' [ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/pioneer/pioneer11/particle/cpi/ NSSDC data archive]}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: left\"  | [[Cosmic Ray]] Telescope ('''CRT''')\n|-\n| [[File:Pioneer 10-11 - P52b - fx.jpg|150px]]\n|Collects data on the composition of the cosmic ray particles and their energy ranges.<ref name=\"NSSDCCRT\">{{cite web |url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1972-012A-12|title= Cosmic-Ray Spectra|publisher= NASA / National Space Science Data Center|accessdate= 2011-02-19}}</ref>\n* {{small|'''Principal investigator:''' [[Frank B.

If there were faint ring particles that could damage a probe in that area, mission planners felt it was better to learn about it via Pioneer. Thus, ''Pioneer 11'' was acting as a \"pioneer\" in a true sense of the word; if danger were detected, then the Voyager probes could be rerouted further away from the rings, but missing the opportunity to visit Uranus and Neptune in the process.\n\n''Pioneer 11'' imaged and nearly collided with one of Saturn's small moons, passing at a distance of no more than {{convert|4000|km|mi|sp=us}}. The object was tentatively identified as [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]], a moon discovered the previous day from ''Pioneer''{{'}}s imaging, and suspected from earlier observations by Earth-based telescopes. After the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] flybys, it became known that there are two similarly-sized moons (Epimetheus and [[Janus (moon)|Janus]]) in the same orbit, so there is some uncertainty about which one was the object of Pioneer's near-miss. ''Pioneer 11'' encountered Janus on September 1, 1979 at 14:52 [[UTC]] at a distance of 2500&nbsp;km and [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] at 16:20 UTC the same day at 103000&nbsp;km.\n\nBesides Epimetheus, instruments located another previously undiscovered small moon and an additional ring, charted Saturn's magnetosphere and magnetic field and found its planet-size moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], to be too cold for life. Hurtling underneath the ring plane, the probe sent back pictures of Saturn's rings. The rings, which normally seem bright when observed from Earth, appeared dark in the Pioneer pictures, and the dark gaps in the rings seen from Earth appeared as bright rings.\n\n{{Gallery|align=center\n|width=175 |lines=1\n|File:P11F81.jpg|alt1=Pioneer 11 image of Saturn (image F81).

Yielding to multiple proposals throughout the 1960s, early mission objectives were defined as:\n* Explore the [[interplanetary medium]] beyond the orbit of Mars\n* Investigate the nature of the asteroid belt from the scientific standpoint and assess the belt's possible hazard to missions to the outer planets.\n* Explore the [[Atmosphere of Jupiter|environment of Jupiter]].\n\nSubsequent planning for an encounter with Saturn added many more goals:\n* Map the magnetic field of Saturn and determine its intensity, direction, and structure.\n* Determine how many electrons and protons of various energies are distributed along the trajectory of the spacecraft through the Saturn system.\n* Map the interaction of the Saturn system with the [[solar wind]].\n* Measure the temperature of Saturn's atmosphere and that of Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn.\n* Determine the structure of the upper atmosphere of Saturn where molecules are expected to be electrically charged and form an ionosphere.\n* Map the thermal structure of [[Atmosphere of Saturn|Saturn's atmosphere]] by infrared observations coupled with [[radio occultation]] data.\n* Obtain spin-scan images of the [[Saturnian system]] in two colors during the encounter sequence and polarimetry measurements of the planet.\n* Probe the ring system and the atmosphere of Saturn with S-band radio occultation.\n* Determine more precisely the masses of Saturn and its larger satellites by accurate observations of the effects of their gravitational fields on the motion of the spacecraft.\n* As a precursor to the [[Voyager Program|Mariner Jupiter/Saturn mission]], verify the environment of the ring plane to find out where it may be safely crossed by the Mariner spacecraft without serious damage.<ref>Mark, Hans: [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-349/ch5.htm ''Pioneer Odyssey'' SP-349/396, Chapter 5, NASA-Ames Research Center, 1974]</ref>\n\n''Pioneer 11'' was built by [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] and managed as part of the [[Pioneer program]] by [[NASA Ames Research Center]].<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/missions/archive/pioneer.html NASA - The Pioneer Missions]</ref> A backup unit, [[Pioneer H]], is currently on display in the \"Milestones of Flight\" exhibit at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/gal100/index.cfm#pioneer10|title=Milestones of Flight|publisher=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum}}</ref> Many elements of the mission proved to be critical in the planning of the [[Voyager program|''Voyager'' program]].<ref name=\"burrows\">William E.

If there were faint ring particles that could damage a probe in that area, mission planners felt it was better to learn about it via Pioneer. Thus, ''Pioneer 11'' was acting as a \"pioneer\" in a true sense of the word; if danger were detected, then the Voyager probes could be rerouted further away from the rings, but missing the opportunity to visit Uranus and Neptune in the process.\n\n''Pioneer 11'' imaged and nearly collided with one of Saturn's small moons, passing at a distance of no more than {{convert|4000|km|mi|sp=us}}. The object was tentatively identified as [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]], a moon discovered the previous day from ''Pioneer''{{'}}s imaging, and suspected from earlier observations by Earth-based telescopes. After the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] flybys, it became known that there are two similarly-sized moons (Epimetheus and [[Janus (moon)|Janus]]) in the same orbit, so there is some uncertainty about which one was the object of Pioneer's near-miss. ''Pioneer 11'' encountered Janus on September 1, 1979 at 14:52 [[UTC]] at a distance of 2500&nbsp;km and [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] at 16:20 UTC the same day at 103000&nbsp;km.\n\nBesides Epimetheus, instruments located another previously undiscovered small moon and an additional ring, charted Saturn's magnetosphere and magnetic field and found its planet-size moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], to be too cold for life. Hurtling underneath the ring plane, the probe sent back pictures of Saturn's rings. The rings, which normally seem bright when observed from Earth, appeared dark in the Pioneer pictures, and the dark gaps in the rings seen from Earth appeared as bright rings.\n\n{{Gallery|align=center\n|width=175 |lines=1\n|File:P11F81.jpg|alt1=Pioneer 11 image of Saturn (image F81).

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|Swann]]'' decision, which supported busing programs to integrate school districts to remedy ''[[de jure]]'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]], but opposed it to remedy ''[[de facto]]'' segregation, as in Delaware. He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]].\n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]].

He was [[United States Senate elections, 1972|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972, when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]].

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|Swann]]'' decision, which supported busing programs to integrate school districts to remedy ''[[de jure]]'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]], but opposed it to remedy ''[[de facto]]'' segregation, as in Delaware. He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

It is a mainly residential district of [[Inner London]], extending from Islington's [[Islington#Islington High Street|High Street]] to Highbury Fields, encompassing the area around the busy High Street, [[Upper Street]], [[Essex Road]] (former \"Lower Street\"), and [[Southgate Road]] to the east.\n\n==Modern definition==\nIslington grew as a sprawling [[Middlesex]] village along the line of the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]], and has provided the name of the modern borough. This gave rise to some confusion, as neighbouring districts may also be said to be in Islington. This district is bounded by [[Liverpool Road]] to the west and [[City Road]] and Southgate Road to the south-east. Its northernmost point is in the area of [[Canonbury]]. The main north\u2013south high street, [[A1 road (London)#Upper Street|Upper Street]] splits at Highbury Corner to Holloway Road to the west and St. Paul's Road to the east.\n\nThe  [[Angel, London|Angel]]  [[Business improvement district#United Kingdom|business improvement district]] (BID), an area centered around the [[Angel tube station]], exists within southern Islington district and northern portions of two other districts in the London Borough of Islington \u2013  [[Finsbury]] and [[Pentonville]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Islington Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the wards of Islington Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]\n\n===Etymology===\nIslington was originally named by the [[Saxons]] ''Giseldone'' (1005), then ''Gislandune'' (1062). The name means \"G\u012bsla's hill\" from the Old English [[personal name]] ''G\u012bsla'' and ''dun'' (\"hill\", \"[[Downland|down]]\"). The name later mutated to ''Isledon'', which remained in use well into the 17th century when the modern form arose.<ref name=Growth>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=6734 \"Islington: Growth\", A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 8: Islington and Stoke Newington parishes (1985), pp. 9\u201319].

What is known is that the [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] from [[Aldersgate]] came into use in the 14th century, connecting with a new turnpike (toll road) up [[Highgate Hill]]. This was along the line of modern Upper Street, with a toll gate at [[The Angel, Islington|The Angel]] defining the extent of the village. The ''Back Road'', the modern [[Liverpool Road]], was primarily a [[drovers' road]] where cattle would be rested before the final leg of their journey to [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]]. Pens and sheds were erected along this road to accommodate the animals.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=7111 'Islington: Communications', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 8: Islington and Stoke Newington parishes (1985), pp. 3\u20138].

There were substantial medieval moated [[manor house]]s in the area, principally at Canonbury and Highbury. In 1548, there were 440 communicants listed and the rural atmosphere, with access to the City and Westminster, made it a popular residence for the rich and eminent.<ref name=Growth/> The local inns harboured many fugitives and sheltered recusants.\n\nThe [[Royal Agricultural Hall]] was built in 1862 on the [[Liverpool Road]] site of William Dixon's Cattle Layers. The hall was 75&nbsp;ft high and the arched glass roof spanned 125&nbsp;ft. It was built for the annual [[Smithfield Show]] in December of that year but was popular for other purposes, including recitals and the [[Royal Tournament]]. It was the primary exhibition site for London until the 20th century and the largest building of its kind, holding up to 50,000 people.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=168&st=Islington A Vision of Britain \u2013 Islington].

These included [[Sadler's Wells]], London Spa and [[Clerkenwell]].\n\nBy the 17th century these traditional sources were inadequate to supply the growing population and plans were laid to construct a waterway, the [[New River (England)|New River]], to bring fresh water from the source of the [[River Lea]], in [[Hertfordshire]] to New River Head, below Islington in [[Finsbury]]. The river was opened on 29 September 1613 by Sir [[Hugh Myddelton]], the constructor of the project. His statue still stands where Upper Street meets Essex Road. The course of the river ran to the east of Upper Street, and much of its course is now covered and forms a ''linear park'' through the area.<ref>[http://www.thameswater.co.uk/waterinschools/newriver/story.html ''The Story of the New River'' (Thames Water)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211190732/http://www.thameswater.co.uk/waterinschools/newriver/story.html |date=11 February 2008 }}.

The stretch is marked above with a series of pavement plaques so walkers may find their way from one entrance to the other. The area of the canal east of the tunnel and north of the City Road was once dominated by much warehousing and industry surrounding the large City Road Basin and Wenlock Basin. Those old buildings that survive here are now largely residential or small creative work units. This stretch has an old double-fronted pub ''The Narrowboat'', one side accessed from the towpath.\n\nThe canal was constructed in 1820 to carry cargo from [[Limehouse]] into the canal system. There is no tow-path in the tunnel so bargees had to ''walk'' their barges through, braced against the roof.<ref>Alan Faulkner \"The Regent's Canal: London's Hidden Waterway\" (2005) {{ISBN|1-870002-59-8}}</ref> Commercial use of the canal has declined since the 1960s.\n\n===Market gardens and entertainments===\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries the availability of water made Islington a good place for growing vegetables to feed London. The manor became a popular excursion destination for Londoners, attracted to the area by its rural feel. Many [[public houses]] were therefore built to serve the needs of both the excursionists and travellers on the turnpike. By 1716, there were 56 ale-house keepers in Upper Street, also offering pleasure and tea gardens, and activities such as archery, skittle alleys and bowling. By the 18th century, music and dancing were offered, together with billiards, firework displays and balloon ascents. The ''[[The King's Head Theatre|King's Head Tavern]]'', now a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] building with a theatre, has remained on the same site, opposite the parish church, since 1543.<ref name=social/> The founder of the theatre, Dan Crawford, who died in 2005, disagreed with the introduction of decimal coinage. For twenty-plus years after decimalisation (on 15 February 1971), the bar continued to show prices and charge for drinks in pre-decimalisation currency.\n\nBy the 19th century many [[music halls]] and theatres were established around [[Islington Green]]. One such was Collins' Music Hall, the remains of which are now partly incorporated into a bookshop. The remainder of the Hall has been redeveloped into a new theatre, with its entrance at the bottom of [[Essex Road]].  It stood on the site of the Landsdowne Tavern, where the landlord had built an entertainment room for customers who wanted to sing (and later for professional entertainers). It was founded in 1862 by Samuel Thomas Collins Vagg and by 1897 had become a 1,800-seat theatre with 10 bars. The theatre suffered damage in a fire in 1958 and has not reopened.<ref name=social/> Between 92 and 162 acts were put on each evening and performers who started there included [[Marie Lloyd]], [[George Robey]], [[Harry Lauder]], [[Harry Tate]], [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]], [[Vesta Tilley]], [[Tommy Trinder]], [[Gracie Fields]], [[Tommy Handley]] and [[Norman Wisdom]].\n[[File:Islington E Baker 1805.jpg|thumb|250px|An 1805 map of Islington]]\n\nThe Islington Literary and Scientific Society was established in 1833 and first met in Mr. Edgeworth's Academy on Upper Street. Its goal was to spread knowledge through lectures, discussions, and experiments, politics and theology being forbidden. A building, the Literary and Scientific Institution, was erected in 1837 in Wellington (later Almeida) Street, designed by Roumieu and Gough in a stuccoed Grecian style. It included a library (containing 3,300 volumes in 1839), reading room, museum, laboratory, and lecture theatre seating 500. The subscription was two guineas a year. After the library was sold off in 1872, the building was sold or leased in 1874 to the ''Wellington Club'', which occupied it until 1886. In 1885 the hall was used for concerts, balls, and public meetings. The [[Salvation Army]] bought the building in 1890, renamed it the Wellington Castle barracks, and remained there until 1955. The building became a factory and showroom for Beck's British Carnival Novelties for a few years from 1956, after which it stood empty. In 1978 a campaign began with the goal to redevelop the building as a theatre. A public appeal was launched in 1981, and a festival of avant-garde theatre and music was held there and at other Islington venues in 1982. What has become the successful [[Almeida Theatre]] was founded.<ref name=social/>\n\n===Housing===\nSome early development took place to accommodate the popularity of the nearby Sadler's Wells, which became a resort in the 16th century, but the 19th century saw the greatest expansion in housing, soon to cover the whole parish. In 1801, the population was 10,212, but by 1891 this had increased to 319,143. This rapid expansion was partly due to the introduction of horse-drawn omnibuses in 1830. Large well-built houses and fashionable squares drew clerks, artisans and professionals to the district. However, from the middle of the 19th century the poor were being displaced by clearances in inner London to build the new railway stations and goods yards. Many of the displaced settled in Islington, with the houses becoming occupied by many families. This, combined with the railways pushing into outer Middlesex, reduced Islington's attraction for the \"better off\" as it became \"unfashionable\".<ref name=\"world and its people\">{{cite book\n  |last = Dunton\n  |first = Larkin\n  |authorlink =\n  |title = The World and Its People\n  |url = https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop05duntgoog\n  |publisher = Silver, Burdett\n  |series =\n  |year = 1896\n  |page = [https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop05duntgoog/page/n37 29]}}</ref> The area fell into a long decline; and by the mid-20th century, it was largely run-down and a byword for urban poverty.<ref name=Growth/>\n\n[[The Blitz|The aerial bombing of World War II]] caused much damage to Islington's housing stock, with 3,200 dwellings destroyed. Before the war a number of 1930s [[Public housing in the United Kingdom|council housing]] blocks had been added to the stock. After the war, partly as a result of bomb site redevelopment, the council housing boom got into its stride, reaching its peak in the 1960s: several extensive estates were constructed, by both the [[Metropolitan Borough of Islington]] and the [[London County Council]]. Clearance of the worst [[terraced housing]] was undertaken, but Islington continued to be very densely populated, with a high level of overcrowding. The district has many council blocks, and the local authority has begun to replace some of them.\n\nFrom the 1960s, the remaining [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] terraces were rediscovered by middle-class families. Many of the houses were rehabilitated, and the area became newly fashionable. This displacement of the poor by the aspirational has become known as [[gentrification]]. Among the new residents were a number of figures who became central in the [[New Labour]] movement, including [[Tony Blair]] before his victory in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]. According to ''[[The Guardian]] in 2006,'' \"Islington is widely regarded as the spiritual home of Britain's left-wing intelligentsia.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1724459,00.html David Clark, \"Accusations of anti-Semitic chic are poisonous intellectual thuggery\"]; ''The Guardian'', 6 March 2006, Retrieved 9 March 2007</ref> The ''[[Blair-Brown deal|Granita Pact]]'' between [[Gordon Brown]] and Tony Blair is said to have been made at a now defunct restaurant on Upper Street.<ref>Happold, Tom and Maguire, Kevin.

It was the target of a [[1982 bombing of the African National Congress headquarters in London|bomb attack in 1982]].\n\nThe completion of the [[Victoria line]] and redevelopment of [[Angel tube station]] created the conditions for developers to renovate many of the early Victorian and Georgian townhouses. They also built new developments.  Islington remains a district with diverse inhabitants, with its private houses and apartments not far from social housing in immediately neighbouring wards such as Finsbury and Clerkenwell to the south, Bloomsbury and King's Cross to the west, and Highbury to the north west, and also the Hackney districts of De Beauvoir and Old Street to the north east.\n\nIslington is the most densely populated borough in the UK according to the 2011 census, with a population density of 138.7 people per hectare, compared to an average of 52.0 for London.\n\n==Upper Street==\n[[Upper Street]] is the main shopping street of central Islington, and carries the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]].\n\n==Islington High Street==\nIslington High Street is the former [[High Street]] of the original village of Islington.  High Street runs approximately {{convert|500|m|mi}} from the intersection of [[London Inner Ring Road#Pentonville Road|Pentonville Road]] and [[City Road]] at the south end to [[Islington Green]] at the north end, where it branches into [[Upper Street]] and [[Essex Road]] (former Lower Street) \u2013 though some maps may simply show High Street as the southern portion of Upper Street.  The earliest reference to Islington High Street is its appearance on a 1590 map of the area. At this time, nine [[inns]] (including the famous [[The Angel, Islington|Angel]], which has subsequently given its name to the area around High Street), as well as housing and a public pond were shown lining the street.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last =Croot\n  | first =Patricia\n  | authorlink =\n  | author2 =\n  | title =Islington Growth\n  | journal =A History of the County of Middlesex\n  | volume =8\n  | issue =\n  | pages =9\u201319\n  | publisher =British History Online\n  | year =1985\n  | url =http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=6734\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | accessdate =2007-05-11  }}</ref> Then as now, Islington was and is unusual in that the village church, [[St Mary's Church, Islington|St Mary's]], does not stand on the high street but is some way off on Upper Street.\n\nIn 1716 Islington High Street came under the control of the newly formed Islington Turnpike Trust.

What is known is that the [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] from [[Aldersgate]] came into use in the 14th century, connecting with a new turnpike (toll road) up [[Highgate Hill]]. This was along the line of modern Upper Street, with a toll gate at [[The Angel, Islington|The Angel]] defining the extent of the village. The ''Back Road'', the modern [[Liverpool Road]], was primarily a [[drovers' road]] where cattle would be rested before the final leg of their journey to [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]]. Pens and sheds were erected along this road to accommodate the animals.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=7111 'Islington: Communications', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 8: Islington and Stoke Newington parishes (1985), pp. 3\u20138].

There were substantial medieval moated [[manor house]]s in the area, principally at Canonbury and Highbury.

(November 2005)]]\nThe hill on which Islington stands has long supplied the [[City of London]] with water, the first projects drawing water through wooden pipes from the many springs that lay at its foot, in [[Finsbury]]. These included [[Sadler's Wells]], London Spa and [[Clerkenwell]].\n\nBy the 17th century these traditional sources were inadequate to supply the growing population and plans were laid to construct a waterway, the [[New River (England)|New River]], to bring fresh water from the source of the [[River Lea]], in [[Hertfordshire]] to New River Head, below Islington in [[Finsbury]]. The river was opened on 29 September 1613 by Sir [[Hugh Myddelton]], the constructor of the project. His statue still stands where Upper Street meets Essex Road. The course of the river ran to the east of Upper Street, and much of its course is now covered and forms a ''linear park'' through the area.<ref>[http://www.thameswater.co.uk/waterinschools/newriver/story.html ''The Story of the New River'' (Thames Water)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211190732/http://www.thameswater.co.uk/waterinschools/newriver/story.html |date=11 February 2008 }}.

The stretch is marked above with a series of pavement plaques so walkers may find their way from one entrance to the other. The area of the canal east of the tunnel and north of the City Road was once dominated by much warehousing and industry surrounding the large City Road Basin and Wenlock Basin. Those old buildings that survive here are now largely residential or small creative work units. This stretch has an old double-fronted pub ''The Narrowboat'', one side accessed from the towpath.\n\nThe canal was constructed in 1820 to carry cargo from [[Limehouse]] into the canal system. There is no tow-path in the tunnel so bargees had to ''walk'' their barges through, braced against the roof.<ref>Alan Faulkner \"The Regent's Canal: London's Hidden Waterway\" (2005) {{ISBN|1-870002-59-8}}</ref> Commercial use of the canal has declined since the 1960s.\n\n===Market gardens and entertainments===\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries the availability of water made Islington a good place for growing vegetables to feed London. The manor became a popular excursion destination for Londoners, attracted to the area by its rural feel. Many [[public houses]] were therefore built to serve the needs of both the excursionists and travellers on the turnpike. By 1716, there were 56 ale-house keepers in Upper Street, also offering pleasure and tea gardens, and activities such as archery, skittle alleys and bowling. By the 18th century, music and dancing were offered, together with billiards, firework displays and balloon ascents. The ''[[The King's Head Theatre|King's Head Tavern]]'', now a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] building with a theatre, has remained on the same site, opposite the parish church, since 1543.<ref name=social/> The founder of the theatre, Dan Crawford, who died in 2005, disagreed with the introduction of decimal coinage. For twenty-plus years after decimalisation (on 15 February 1971), the bar continued to show prices and charge for drinks in pre-decimalisation currency.\n\nBy the 19th century many [[music halls]] and theatres were established around [[Islington Green]]. One such was Collins' Music Hall, the remains of which are now partly incorporated into a bookshop. The remainder of the Hall has been redeveloped into a new theatre, with its entrance at the bottom of [[Essex Road]].  It stood on the site of the Landsdowne Tavern, where the landlord had built an entertainment room for customers who wanted to sing (and later for professional entertainers). It was founded in 1862 by Samuel Thomas Collins Vagg and by 1897 had become a 1,800-seat theatre with 10 bars. The theatre suffered damage in a fire in 1958 and has not reopened.<ref name=social/> Between 92 and 162 acts were put on each evening and performers who started there included [[Marie Lloyd]], [[George Robey]], [[Harry Lauder]], [[Harry Tate]], [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]], [[Vesta Tilley]], [[Tommy Trinder]], [[Gracie Fields]], [[Tommy Handley]] and [[Norman Wisdom]].\n[[File:Islington E Baker 1805.jpg|thumb|250px|An 1805 map of Islington]]\n\nThe Islington Literary and Scientific Society was established in 1833 and first met in Mr. Edgeworth's Academy on Upper Street. Its goal was to spread knowledge through lectures, discussions, and experiments, politics and theology being forbidden. A building, the Literary and Scientific Institution, was erected in 1837 in Wellington (later Almeida) Street, designed by Roumieu and Gough in a stuccoed Grecian style. It included a library (containing 3,300 volumes in 1839), reading room, museum, laboratory, and lecture theatre seating 500. The subscription was two guineas a year. After the library was sold off in 1872, the building was sold or leased in 1874 to the ''Wellington Club'', which occupied it until 1886. In 1885 the hall was used for concerts, balls, and public meetings. The [[Salvation Army]] bought the building in 1890, renamed it the Wellington Castle barracks, and remained there until 1955. The building became a factory and showroom for Beck's British Carnival Novelties for a few years from 1956, after which it stood empty. In 1978 a campaign began with the goal to redevelop the building as a theatre. A public appeal was launched in 1981, and a festival of avant-garde theatre and music was held there and at other Islington venues in 1982. What has become the successful [[Almeida Theatre]] was founded.<ref name=social/>\n\n===Housing===\nSome early development took place to accommodate the popularity of the nearby Sadler's Wells, which became a resort in the 16th century, but the 19th century saw the greatest expansion in housing, soon to cover the whole parish. In 1801, the population was 10,212, but by 1891 this had increased to 319,143. This rapid expansion was partly due to the introduction of horse-drawn omnibuses in 1830. Large well-built houses and fashionable squares drew clerks, artisans and professionals to the district. However, from the middle of the 19th century the poor were being displaced by clearances in inner London to build the new railway stations and goods yards. Many of the displaced settled in Islington, with the houses becoming occupied by many families. This, combined with the railways pushing into outer Middlesex, reduced Islington's attraction for the \"better off\" as it became \"unfashionable\".<ref name=\"world and its people\">{{cite book\n  |last = Dunton\n  |first = Larkin\n  |authorlink =\n  |title = The World and Its People\n  |url = https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop05duntgoog\n  |publisher = Silver, Burdett\n  |series =\n  |year = 1896\n  |page = [https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop05duntgoog/page/n37 29]}}</ref> The area fell into a long decline; and by the mid-20th century, it was largely run-down and a byword for urban poverty.<ref name=Growth/>\n\n[[The Blitz|The aerial bombing of World War II]] caused much damage to Islington's housing stock, with 3,200 dwellings destroyed. Before the war a number of 1930s [[Public housing in the United Kingdom|council housing]] blocks had been added to the stock. After the war, partly as a result of bomb site redevelopment, the council housing boom got into its stride, reaching its peak in the 1960s: several extensive estates were constructed, by both the [[Metropolitan Borough of Islington]] and the [[London County Council]]. Clearance of the worst [[terraced housing]] was undertaken, but Islington continued to be very densely populated, with a high level of overcrowding. The district has many council blocks, and the local authority has begun to replace some of them.\n\nFrom the 1960s, the remaining [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] terraces were rediscovered by middle-class families. Many of the houses were rehabilitated, and the area became newly fashionable. This displacement of the poor by the aspirational has become known as [[gentrification]]. Among the new residents were a number of figures who became central in the [[New Labour]] movement, including [[Tony Blair]] before his victory in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]. According to ''[[The Guardian]] in 2006,'' \"Islington is widely regarded as the spiritual home of Britain's left-wing intelligentsia.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1724459,00.html David Clark, \"Accusations of anti-Semitic chic are poisonous intellectual thuggery\"]; ''The Guardian'', 6 March 2006, Retrieved 9 March 2007</ref> The ''[[Blair-Brown deal|Granita Pact]]'' between [[Gordon Brown]] and Tony Blair is said to have been made at a now defunct restaurant on Upper Street.<ref>Happold, Tom and Maguire, Kevin.

It was the target of a [[1982 bombing of the African National Congress headquarters in London|bomb attack in 1982]].\n\nThe completion of the [[Victoria line]] and redevelopment of [[Angel tube station]] created the conditions for developers to renovate many of the early Victorian and Georgian townhouses. They also built new developments.  Islington remains a district with diverse inhabitants, with its private houses and apartments not far from social housing in immediately neighbouring wards such as Finsbury and Clerkenwell to the south, Bloomsbury and King's Cross to the west, and Highbury to the north west, and also the Hackney districts of De Beauvoir and Old Street to the north east.\n\nIslington is the most densely populated borough in the UK according to the 2011 census, with a population density of 138.7 people per hectare, compared to an average of 52.0 for London.\n\n==Upper Street==\n[[Upper Street]] is the main shopping street of central Islington, and carries the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]].\n\n==Islington High Street==\nIslington High Street is the former [[High Street]] of the original village of Islington.

The earliest reference to Islington High Street is its appearance on a 1590 map of the area.
