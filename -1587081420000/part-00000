E.}}</ref>\n\nOne example is a mutation in the ''rpoB'' gene, which encodes the beta subunit of the bacteria's RNA polymerase. In non-resistant TB, rifampin binds the beta subunit of RNA polymerase and disrupt transcription elongation. Mutation in the ''rpoB'' gene changes the sequence of amino acids and eventual conformation of the beta subunit. In this case rifampin can no longer bind or prevent transcription, and the bacteria is resistant.\n\nOther mutations make the bacterium resistant to other drugs. For example, there are many mutations that confer resistance to isoniazid (INH), including in the genes ''katG'', ''inhA'', ''ahpC'' and others. Amino acid replacements in the NADH binding site of InhA apparently result in INH resistance by preventing the inhibition of mycolic acid biosynthesis, which the bacterium uses in its cell wall. Mutations in the ''katG'' gene make the enzyme catalase peroxidase unable to convert INH to its biologically active form. Hence, INH is ineffective and the bacteria is resistant.'''<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1128/AAC.46.2.267-274.2002 |title=Evolution of Drug Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Clinical and Molecular Perspective |year=2002 |last1=Gillespie |first1=S.

If TB is identified and treated soon, drug resistance can be avoided.\n#Completion of treatment: Previous treatment of TB is an indicator of MDR TB. If the patient does not complete his/her antibiotic treatment, or if the physician does not prescribe the proper antibiotic regimen, resistance can develop. Also, drugs that are of poor quality or less in quantity, especially in developing countries, contribute to MDR TB.\n#Patients with HIV/AIDS should be identified and diagnosed as soon as possible. They lack the immunity to fight the TB infection and are at great risk of developing drug resistance.\n#Identify contacts who could have contracted TB: i.e. family members, people in close contact, etc.\n#Research: Much research and funding is needed in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of TB and MDR TB.\n\n\"Opponents of a universal tuberculosis treatment, reasoning from misguided notions of cost-effectiveness, fail to acknowledge that MDRTB is not a disease of poor people in distant places.

First, the treatment of smear-positive cases in DOTS programs must be the foundation of any tuberculosis control approach, and should be a basic practice for all control programs. Second, there is a powerful economic case for treating smear-negative and extra-pulmonary cases in DOTS programs along with treating smear-negative and extra-pulmonary cases in DOTS programs as a new WHO \"STOP TB\" approach and the second global plan for tuberculosis control. Last, but not least, the study shows that significant scaling up of all interventions is needed in the next 10 years if the millennium development goal and related goals for tuberculosis control are to be achieved. If the case detection rate can be improved, this will guarantee that people who gain access to treatment facilities are covered and that coverage is widely distributed to people who do not now have access.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.38645.660093.68 |title=Cost effectiveness analysis of strategies for tuberculosis control in developing countries |year=2005 |last1=Baltussen |first1=R. |journal=BMJ |volume=331 |issue=7529 |pages=1364 |pmid=16282379 |last2=Floyd |first2=K |last3=Dye |first3=C |pmc=1309642}}</ref>\n\nIn general, treatment courses are measured in months to years; MDR-TB may require surgery, and death rates remain high despite optimal treatment.

Mortality and morbidity in patients treated in non-specialist centers are <!--subject is plural: \"mortality and morbidity\"-->significantly higher to those of patients treated in specialist centers. Treatment of MDR-TB must be done on the basis of sensitivity testing: it is impossible to treat such patients without this information. When treating a patient with suspected MDR-TB, pending the result of laboratory sensitivity testing, the patient could be started on SHREZ ([[Streptomycin]]+ [[isoniazid|isonicotinyl Hydrazine]]+ [[Rifampicin]]+[[Ethambutol]]+ [[pyrazinamide|pyraZinamide]]) and [[moxifloxacin]] with [[cycloserine]]. There is evidence that previous therapy with a drug for more than a month is associated with diminished efficacy of that drug regardless of ''in vitro'' tests indicating susceptibility.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199302253280802 |title=Treatment of 171 Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis Resistant to Isoniazid and Rifampin |year=1993 |last1=Goble |first1=Marian |last2=Iseman |first2=Michael D. |last3=Madsen |first3=Lorie A. |last4=Waite |first4=Dennis |last5=Ackerson |first5=Lynn |last6=Horsburgh Jr |first6=C.

In addition to the obvious risks (i.e., known exposure to a patient with MDR-TB), risk factors for MDR-TB include HIV infection, previous incarceration, failed TB treatment, failure to respond to standard TB treatment, and relapse following standard TB treatment.\n\nA gene probe for ''[[rpoB]]'' is available in some countries. This serves as a useful marker for MDR-TB, because isolated RMP resistance is rare (except when patients have a history of being treated with rifampicin alone). If the results of a gene probe (''rpoB'') are known to be positive, then it is reasonable to omit RMP and to use SHEZ+[[moxifloxacin|MXF]]+[[cycloserine]]. The reason for maintaining the patient on INH is that INH is so potent in treating TB that it is foolish to omit it until there is microbiological proof that it is ineffective (even though isoniazid resistance so commonly occurs with rifampicin resistance).\n\nFor treatment of RR- and MDT-TB, WHO treatment guidelines are as follows: \"a regimen with at least five effective TB medicines during the intensive phase is recommended, including pyrazinamide and four core second-line TB medicines \u2013 one chosen from Group A, one from Group B, and at least two from Group C3 (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence). If the minimum number of effective TB medicines cannot be composed as given above, an agent from Group D2 and other agents from Group D3 may be added to bring the total to five. It is recommended that the regimen be further strengthened with high-dose isoniazid and/or ethambutol (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence).\" <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK390455/|title=WHO Treatment Guidelines for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, 2016 Update|date=2016|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241549639|series=WHO Guidelines Approved by the Guidelines Review Committee|location=Geneva|pmid=27748093}}</ref> Medicines recommended are the following:\n\n* Group A: Fluoroquinolones (levofloxacinm moxifloxicin, gatifloxacin), linezolid, bedaquiline  \n* Group B: clofazimine, cycloserine/terizidone\n* Group C: Other core second-line agents (ethambutol, delamanid, pyrazinamide, imipenem-cilastatin/meropenem, amikacin/streptomycin, ethionamide/prothionamide, p-aminosalicylic acid)\n\nFor patients with RR-TB or MDR-TB, \"not previously treated with second-line drugs and in whom resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable agents was excluded or is considered highly unlikely, a shorter MDR-TB regimen of 9\u201312 months may be used instead of the longer regimens (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence).\" <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK390455/|title=WHO Treatment Guidelines for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, 2016 Update|date=2016|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241549639|series=WHO Guidelines Approved by the Guidelines Review Committee|location=Geneva|pmid=27748093}}</ref>\n\nIn general, resistance to one drug within a class means resistance to all drugs within that class, but a notable exception is rifabutin: Rifampicin-resistance does not always mean rifabutin-resistance, and the laboratory should be asked to test for it. It is possible to use only one drug within each drug class. If it is difficult finding five drugs to treat then the clinician can request that high-level INH-resistance be looked for. If the strain has only low-level INH-resistance (resistance at 0.2&nbsp;mg/l INH, but sensitive at 1.0&nbsp;mg/l INH), then high dose INH can be used as part of the regimen. When counting drugs, PZA and interferon count as zero; that is to say, when adding PZA to a four-drug regimen, another drug must be chosen to make five. It is not possible to use more than one injectable (STM, capreomycin or amikacin), because the toxic effect of these drugs is additive: If possible, the aminoglycoside should be given daily for a minimum of three months (and perhaps thrice weekly thereafter). Ciprofloxacin should not be used in the treatment of tuberculosis if other fluoroquinolones are available. As of 2008, Cochrane reports that trials of other  fluoroquinolones are ongoing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ziganshina|first=L. E.|last2=Squire|first2=S.

Treatment for MDR-TB must be given for a minimum of 18 months and cannot be stopped until the patient has been culture-negative for a minimum of nine months. It is not unusual for patients with MDR-TB to be on treatment for two years or more.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nPatients with MDR-TB should be isolated in negative-pressure rooms, if possible. Patients with MDR-TB should not be accommodated on the same ward as immunosuppressed patients (HIV-infected patients, or patients on immunosuppressive drugs). Careful monitoring of compliance with treatment is crucial to the management of MDR-TB (and some physicians insist on hospitalisation if only for this reason). Some physicians will insist that these patients remain isolated until their sputum is smear-negative, or even culture-negative (which may take many months, or even years). Keeping these patients in hospital for weeks (or months) on end may be a practical or physical impossibility, and the final decision depends on the clinical judgement of the physician treating that patient. The attending physician should make full use of therapeutic drug monitoring (in particular, of the aminoglycosides) both to monitor compliance and to avoid toxic effects.\n\nSome supplements may be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of tuberculosis, but, for the purposes of counting drugs for MDR-TB, they count as zero (if four drugs are already in the regimen, it may be beneficial to add arginine or vitamin D or both, but another drug will be needed to make five).

Overcrowding in prisons is especially conducive to the spread of tuberculosis; an inmate in a prison hospital has (on average) 3 meters of personal space, and an inmate in a correctional colony has 2 meters.<ref name=\"Bobrik\"/> Specialized hospitals and treatment facilities within the prison system, known as TB colonies, are intended to isolate infected prisoners to prevent transmission; however, as Ruddy et al. demonstrate, there are not enough of these colonies to sufficiently protect staff and other inmates.<ref name=\"Ruddy\"/> Additionally, many cells lack adequate ventilation, which increases likelihood of transmission. Bobrik et al. have also noted food shortages within prisons, which deprive inmates of the nutrition necessary for healthy functioning.<ref name=\"Bobrik\"/>\n\nComorbidity of [[HIV]] within prison populations has also been shown to worsen health outcomes. Nachega & Chaisson articulate that while HIV-infected prisoners are not more susceptible MDR-TB infection, they are more likely to progress to serious clinical illness if infected.<ref name=\"Nachega\"/> According to Stern, HIV infection is 75 times more prevalent in Russian prison populations than in the civilian population.<ref name=\"Stern\"/> Therefore, prison inmates are both more likely to become infected with MDR-TB initially and to experience severe symptoms because of previous exposure to HIV.\n\nShin et al. emphasize another factor in MDR-TB prevalence in Russian prisons: alcohol and substance use.<ref name=\"Shin\"/> Ruddy et al. showed that risk for MDR-TB is three times higher among recreational drug users than non-users.<ref name=\"Ruddy\"/> Shin et al.'s study demonstrated that alcohol usage was linked to poorer outcomes in MDR-TB treatment; they also noted that a majority of subjects within their study (many of whom regularly used alcohol) were nevertheless cured by their aggressive treatment regimen.<ref name=\"Shin\"/>\n\nNon-compliance with treatment plans is often cited as a contributor to MDR-TB transmission and mortality.

In non-resistant TB, rifampin binds the beta subunit of RNA polymerase and disrupt transcription elongation. Mutation in the ''rpoB'' gene changes the sequence of amino acids and eventual conformation of the beta subunit. In this case rifampin can no longer bind or prevent transcription, and the bacteria is resistant.\n\nOther mutations make the bacterium resistant to other drugs. For example, there are many mutations that confer resistance to isoniazid (INH), including in the genes ''katG'', ''inhA'', ''ahpC'' and others. Amino acid replacements in the NADH binding site of InhA apparently result in INH resistance by preventing the inhibition of mycolic acid biosynthesis, which the bacterium uses in its cell wall. Mutations in the ''katG'' gene make the enzyme catalase peroxidase unable to convert INH to its biologically active form. Hence, INH is ineffective and the bacteria is resistant.'''<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1128/AAC.46.2.267-274.2002 |title=Evolution of Drug Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Clinical and Molecular Perspective |year=2002 |last1=Gillespie |first1=S.

If the patient does not complete his/her antibiotic treatment, or if the physician does not prescribe the proper antibiotic regimen, resistance can develop. Also, drugs that are of poor quality or less in quantity, especially in developing countries, contribute to MDR TB.\n#Patients with HIV/AIDS should be identified and diagnosed as soon as possible. They lack the immunity to fight the TB infection and are at great risk of developing drug resistance.\n#Identify contacts who could have contracted TB: i.e. family members, people in close contact, etc.\n#Research: Much research and funding is needed in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of TB and MDR TB.\n\n\"Opponents of a universal tuberculosis treatment, reasoning from misguided notions of cost-effectiveness, fail to acknowledge that MDRTB is not a disease of poor people in distant places.

First, the treatment of smear-positive cases in DOTS programs must be the foundation of any tuberculosis control approach, and should be a basic practice for all control programs. Second, there is a powerful economic case for treating smear-negative and extra-pulmonary cases in DOTS programs along with treating smear-negative and extra-pulmonary cases in DOTS programs as a new WHO \"STOP TB\" approach and the second global plan for tuberculosis control. Last, but not least, the study shows that significant scaling up of all interventions is needed in the next 10 years if the millennium development goal and related goals for tuberculosis control are to be achieved.

Mortality and morbidity in patients treated in non-specialist centers are <!--subject is plural: \"mortality and morbidity\"-->significantly higher to those of patients treated in specialist centers. Treatment of MDR-TB must be done on the basis of sensitivity testing: it is impossible to treat such patients without this information. When treating a patient with suspected MDR-TB, pending the result of laboratory sensitivity testing, the patient could be started on SHREZ ([[Streptomycin]]+ [[isoniazid|isonicotinyl Hydrazine]]+ [[Rifampicin]]+[[Ethambutol]]+ [[pyrazinamide|pyraZinamide]]) and [[moxifloxacin]] with [[cycloserine]]. There is evidence that previous therapy with a drug for more than a month is associated with diminished efficacy of that drug regardless of ''in vitro'' tests indicating susceptibility.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199302253280802 |title=Treatment of 171 Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis Resistant to Isoniazid and Rifampin |year=1993 |last1=Goble |first1=Marian |last2=Iseman |first2=Michael D. |last3=Madsen |first3=Lorie A. |last4=Waite |first4=Dennis |last5=Ackerson |first5=Lynn |last6=Horsburgh Jr |first6=C.

In addition to the obvious risks (i.e., known exposure to a patient with MDR-TB), risk factors for MDR-TB include HIV infection, previous incarceration, failed TB treatment, failure to respond to standard TB treatment, and relapse following standard TB treatment.\n\nA gene probe for ''[[rpoB]]'' is available in some countries. This serves as a useful marker for MDR-TB, because isolated RMP resistance is rare (except when patients have a history of being treated with rifampicin alone). If the results of a gene probe (''rpoB'') are known to be positive, then it is reasonable to omit RMP and to use SHEZ+[[moxifloxacin|MXF]]+[[cycloserine]]. The reason for maintaining the patient on INH is that INH is so potent in treating TB that it is foolish to omit it until there is microbiological proof that it is ineffective (even though isoniazid resistance so commonly occurs with rifampicin resistance).\n\nFor treatment of RR- and MDT-TB, WHO treatment guidelines are as follows: \"a regimen with at least five effective TB medicines during the intensive phase is recommended, including pyrazinamide and four core second-line TB medicines \u2013 one chosen from Group A, one from Group B, and at least two from Group C3 (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence). If the minimum number of effective TB medicines cannot be composed as given above, an agent from Group D2 and other agents from Group D3 may be added to bring the total to five. It is recommended that the regimen be further strengthened with high-dose isoniazid and/or ethambutol (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence).\" <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK390455/|title=WHO Treatment Guidelines for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, 2016 Update|date=2016|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241549639|series=WHO Guidelines Approved by the Guidelines Review Committee|location=Geneva|pmid=27748093}}</ref> Medicines recommended are the following:\n\n* Group A: Fluoroquinolones (levofloxacinm moxifloxicin, gatifloxacin), linezolid, bedaquiline  \n* Group B: clofazimine, cycloserine/terizidone\n* Group C: Other core second-line agents (ethambutol, delamanid, pyrazinamide, imipenem-cilastatin/meropenem, amikacin/streptomycin, ethionamide/prothionamide, p-aminosalicylic acid)\n\nFor patients with RR-TB or MDR-TB, \"not previously treated with second-line drugs and in whom resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable agents was excluded or is considered highly unlikely, a shorter MDR-TB regimen of 9\u201312 months may be used instead of the longer regimens (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence).\" <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK390455/|title=WHO Treatment Guidelines for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, 2016 Update|date=2016|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241549639|series=WHO Guidelines Approved by the Guidelines Review Committee|location=Geneva|pmid=27748093}}</ref>\n\nIn general, resistance to one drug within a class means resistance to all drugs within that class, but a notable exception is rifabutin: Rifampicin-resistance does not always mean rifabutin-resistance, and the laboratory should be asked to test for it. It is possible to use only one drug within each drug class. If it is difficult finding five drugs to treat then the clinician can request that high-level INH-resistance be looked for. If the strain has only low-level INH-resistance (resistance at 0.2&nbsp;mg/l INH, but sensitive at 1.0&nbsp;mg/l INH), then high dose INH can be used as part of the regimen. When counting drugs, PZA and interferon count as zero; that is to say, when adding PZA to a four-drug regimen, another drug must be chosen to make five. It is not possible to use more than one injectable (STM, capreomycin or amikacin), because the toxic effect of these drugs is additive: If possible, the aminoglycoside should be given daily for a minimum of three months (and perhaps thrice weekly thereafter). Ciprofloxacin should not be used in the treatment of tuberculosis if other fluoroquinolones are available. As of 2008, Cochrane reports that trials of other  fluoroquinolones are ongoing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ziganshina|first=L. E.|last2=Squire|first2=S.

Treatment for MDR-TB must be given for a minimum of 18 months and cannot be stopped until the patient has been culture-negative for a minimum of nine months. It is not unusual for patients with MDR-TB to be on treatment for two years or more.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nPatients with MDR-TB should be isolated in negative-pressure rooms, if possible. Patients with MDR-TB should not be accommodated on the same ward as immunosuppressed patients (HIV-infected patients, or patients on immunosuppressive drugs). Careful monitoring of compliance with treatment is crucial to the management of MDR-TB (and some physicians insist on hospitalisation if only for this reason). Some physicians will insist that these patients remain isolated until their sputum is smear-negative, or even culture-negative (which may take many months, or even years). Keeping these patients in hospital for weeks (or months) on end may be a practical or physical impossibility, and the final decision depends on the clinical judgement of the physician treating that patient. The attending physician should make full use of therapeutic drug monitoring (in particular, of the aminoglycosides) both to monitor compliance and to avoid toxic effects.\n\nSome supplements may be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of tuberculosis, but, for the purposes of counting drugs for MDR-TB, they count as zero (if four drugs are already in the regimen, it may be beneficial to add arginine or vitamin D or both, but another drug will be needed to make five).

Overcrowding in prisons is especially conducive to the spread of tuberculosis; an inmate in a prison hospital has (on average) 3 meters of personal space, and an inmate in a correctional colony has 2 meters.<ref name=\"Bobrik\"/> Specialized hospitals and treatment facilities within the prison system, known as TB colonies, are intended to isolate infected prisoners to prevent transmission; however, as Ruddy et al. demonstrate, there are not enough of these colonies to sufficiently protect staff and other inmates.<ref name=\"Ruddy\"/> Additionally, many cells lack adequate ventilation, which increases likelihood of transmission. Bobrik et al. have also noted food shortages within prisons, which deprive inmates of the nutrition necessary for healthy functioning.<ref name=\"Bobrik\"/>\n\nComorbidity of [[HIV]] within prison populations has also been shown to worsen health outcomes. Nachega & Chaisson articulate that while HIV-infected prisoners are not more susceptible MDR-TB infection, they are more likely to progress to serious clinical illness if infected.<ref name=\"Nachega\"/> According to Stern, HIV infection is 75 times more prevalent in Russian prison populations than in the civilian population.<ref name=\"Stern\"/> Therefore, prison inmates are both more likely to become infected with MDR-TB initially and to experience severe symptoms because of previous exposure to HIV.\n\nShin et al. emphasize another factor in MDR-TB prevalence in Russian prisons: alcohol and substance use.<ref name=\"Shin\"/> Ruddy et al. showed that risk for MDR-TB is three times higher among recreational drug users than non-users.<ref name=\"Ruddy\"/> Shin et al.'s study demonstrated that alcohol usage was linked to poorer outcomes in MDR-TB treatment; they also noted that a majority of subjects within their study (many of whom regularly used alcohol) were nevertheless cured by their aggressive treatment regimen.<ref name=\"Shin\"/>\n\nNon-compliance with treatment plans is often cited as a contributor to MDR-TB transmission and mortality. Indeed, of the 80 newly-released TB-infected inmates in Fry et al.'s study, 73.8% did not report visiting a community dispensary for further treatment.<ref name=\"Fry\">{{cite journal |author1=Fry R. |author2=Khoshnood K. |author3=Vdovichenko E. |author4=Granskaya J. |author5=Sazhin V. |author6=Shpakovskaya L |author7=Zhemkov V. |author8=Zhemkova M. |author9=Rowhani-Rahbar A. |author10=Funk M. |author11=Kozlov A. | year = 2005 | title = Barriers to completion of tuberculosis treatment among prisoners and former prisoners in St. Petersburg, Russia | url = | journal = The International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease | volume = 9 | issue = 9| pages = 1027\u20131033 |pmid=16158896 }}</ref> Ruddy et al. cite release from facilities as one of the main causes of interruption in prisoner's TB treatment, in addition to non-compliance within the prison and upon reintegration into civilian life.<ref name=\"Ruddy\"/> Fry et al.'s study also listed side effects of TB treatment medications (especially in HIV positive individuals), financial worries, housing insecurities, family problems, and fear of arrest as factors that prevented some prisoners from properly adhering to TB treatment.<ref name=\"Fry\"/> They also note that some researchers have argued that the short-term gains TB-positive prisoners receive, such as better food or work exclusion, may dis-incentivize becoming cured.<ref name=\"Fry\"/> In their World Health Organization article, Gelmanova et al. posit that non-adherence to TB treatment indirectly contributes to bacterial resistance.<ref name=\"Gelmanova\">{{cite journal |author1=Gelmanova I. |author2=Keshavjee S. |author3=Golubchikova V. |author4=Berezina V. |author5=Strelis A. |author6=Yanova G. |author7=Atwood S. |author8=Murray M. | year = 2007 | title = Barriers to successful tuberculosis treatment in Tomsk, Russian Federation: non-adherence, default and the acquisition of multidrug resistance | url = | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 85 | issue = 9|pages=703\u201311 |doi=10.2471/BLT.06.038331 |pmid=18026627 |pmc=2636414 }}</ref> Although ineffective or inconsistent treatment does not \"create\" resistant strains, mutations within the high bacterial load in non-adherent prisoners can cause resistance.\n\nNachega & Chaisson argue that inadequate TB control programs are the strongest driver of MDR-TB incidence.<ref name=\"Nachega\"/> They note that prevalence of MDR-TB is 2.5 times higher in areas of poorly controlled TB.<ref name=\"Nachega\"/> Russian-based therapy (i.e., not DOTS) has been criticized by Kimerling et al. as \"inadequate\" in properly controlling TB incidence and transmission.<ref name=\"Kimerling\">{{cite journal |author1=Kimerling M.E. |author2=Kluge H. |author3=Vezhnina N. |author4=Iacovazzi T. |author5=Demeulenaere T. |author6=Portaels F. |author7=Matthys F. | year = 1999 | title = Inadequacy of the current WHO re-treatment regimen in a central Siberian prison: treatment failure and MDR-TB. | url = | journal = The International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 451\u2013453 |title-link=WHO |pmid=10331736 }}</ref> Bobrik et al. note that treatment for MDR-TB is equally inconsistent; the second-line drugs used to treat the prisoners lack specific treatment guidelines, infrastructure, training, or follow-up protocols for prisoners reentering civilian life.<ref name=\"Bobrik\"/>\n\n====Policy impacts====\n\nAs Ruddy et al. note in their scholarly article, Russia's recent penal reforms will greatly reduce the number of inmates inside prison facilities and thus increase the number of ex-convicts integrated into civilian populations.<ref name=\"Ruddy\">{{cite journal |author1=Ruddy M. |author2=Balabanova Y. |author3=Graham C. |author4=Fedorin I. |author5=Malomanova N. |author6=Elisarova E. |author7=Kuznetznov S. |author8=Gusarova G. |author9=Zakharova S. |author10=Melentyev A. |author11=Krukova E. |author12=Golishevskaya V. |author13=Erokhin V. |author14=Dorozhkova I. |author15=Drobniewski F. | year = 2005 | title = Rates of drug resistance and risk factor analysis in civilian and prison patients with tuberculosis in Samar Region, Russia | url = | journal = Thorax | volume = 60 | issue = 2| pages = 130\u2013135 | doi=10.1136/thx.2004.026922|pmid=15681501 |pmc=1747303 }}</ref> Because the incidence of MDR-TB is strongly predicted by past imprisonment, the health of Russian society will be greatly impacted by this change.<ref name=\"Ruddy\"/> Formerly incarcerated Russians will re-enter civilian life and remain within that sphere; as they live as civilians, they will infect others with the contagions they were exposed to in prison.
