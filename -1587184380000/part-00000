Taking a degree in [[history of architecture|architectural history]] from [[Cambridge University]] in 1978, he moved directly into working as a carpenter on building sites and set up a small workshop, trading as Bloomsbury Joinery, in [[London|London\u2019s]] [[Covent Garden]] that year<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. In 1981 he bought a former vegetable warehouse in the same district at a much reduced price because it was earmarked by the [[Greater London Council]] for compulsory purchase, demolition and redevelopment. (The Council was abolished<ref>{{cite report |author=Hansard|date=1803-2005 |title=Streamlining the Cities |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1984/may/22/streamlining-the-cities |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> before the plans could be realized.)\n\nIn the early 1980s the workshop\u2019s output consisted of high quality furniture for the residential market. Exposure to an increasing number of institutional clients came from a chance encounter with Colonel David Gordon-Lennox, commanding officer of the [[Grenadier Guards]], whose own kitchen shelving led to a commission for the regiment\u2019s archive library, and from there a series of bookcases for Inns of Court lawyers<ref>{{cite news |last=Steiner |first=Rupert |date=29 June 1997 |title=Carpenter carved out success by going against the grain | work=The Sunday Times}}</ref>. Many subsequent library commissions have included high-profile installations such as the library of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2009)<ref>{{Cite book |title=A visit to the Supreme Court Library |date=2011 |publisher=Inner Temple Newsletter|}}</ref>.\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the company\u2019s short-lived and ultimately ill-fated engagement with design for the retail market in the form of its robust but modestly priced \u2018Ovolo\u2019 range of bedroom furniture, sold through upmarket outlets such as [[Heal\u2019s]], [[Liberty\u2019s]] and [[John Lewis]]. [[Venture capital]] was raised and significant investment made in a factory in [[Wiltshire]] which opened in 1990. Copyright infringement and the deep UK recession of the late 1980s, which forced the factory\u2019s eventual closure in 1994, prompted a decision to target recession-proof clients with long-term needs to furnish their buildings of architectural quality \u2013\u00a0namely the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Much was owed in this strategic shift to Ray Leigh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GRDM-Newsletter-22.pdf|title=22nd e-newsletter of the Gordon Russell Design Museum|website=www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>, appointed chairman of the limited company in 1990, and an architect whose own background included work on the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951 and a long career, first as design director then managing director, of iconic [[Cotswold]] furniture manufacturer [[Gordon Russell (designer)|Gordon Russell]]<ref>{{Cite book | last=Leigh | first=Ray | title=Advance the Product |date=2015 |publisher=Gordon Russell Trust|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Myerson | first=Jeremy | title=Gordon Russell, Designer of Furniture |date=1992 |publisher=The Design Council of Great Britain|}}</ref>.

The first [[Oxbridge]] commission, of dining hall furniture for [[Corpus Christi College Cambridge]], came in 1991, a job which also marked the company\u2019s first use of computer-aided design<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. The first commission for the Foreign Office \u2013 the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Buenos Aires|British Embassy in Buenos Aires]] \u2013 and the first order over \u00a3250,000, for [[Merton College Oxford]], followed in 1992. 1997 saw a high-profile commission at the height of the \u2018[[Cool Britannia]]\u2019 years for the idiosyncratic new [[British Embassy in Moscow]], designed by [[Ahrends Burton Koralek]]<ref>{{Cite book | last=Melvin | first=Jeremy | title=British Embassy in Moscow |date=1999 |publisher=Foreign & Commonwealth Office}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Powell | first=Kenneth | title=From Russia with love - the Moscow embassy |date=2000 |publisher=Royal Academy Journal|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Taylor | first=David | title=ABK's Moscow Embassy - Britain at its best |date=2000 |publisher=Architect's Journal|}}</ref>, and in 1998 came the first order of over \u00a3500,000, for [[St Hugh\u2019s College, Oxford|St Hugh's College Oxford]].

Although the company had been working expressly on those lines since the early 1990s, it was in 2013 \u2013 with the help of Craig Allen, former creative director at Linley Furniture and a senior buyer at the Conran Shop \u2013 that its brand messages were rationalised. \n\nThe greater part of Luke Hughes & Company furniture is designed for existing or historic buildings. Response to the architecture is key; an understanding of architecture and the design process, and sympathy for the architect who designed it, are central to its work. The pivotal idea behind Luke Hughes & Company\u2019s approach is that in any quality building, the connection between architecture and furniture should be seamless, creating a sense of \u201crightness\u201d, both functionally and aesthetically. Most buildings cannot function without the furniture, yet inappropriate furniture can grossly undermine great architecture<ref>{{cite news | last=Lim | first=Candice | date=2012 |title=In conversation with Luke Hughes | work=Futurarc: the Voice of Green Architecture in Asia | edition=vol 27 }}</ref>.  \n\nThe company\u2019s design practice is focused not only on responding to the aesthetic and functional qualities of the buildings that house its furniture, but also the economic outcomes. Analysis and re-arrangement of the leg positions on the tables in a dining hall such as New College Oxford<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=236}}</ref> or an overhaul of the seating geometry in a small historic theatre<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=150}}</ref> add capacity, improving the efficiency and profitability of the building.

The proposition is that the longer a building and its furniture stay relevant, the longer the carbon stays locked up, and the longer it stays locked up, the less CO2 emissions. Luke Hughes furniture is designed for long life, 30 \u2013 50 years minimum.  The strict company policy is to buy solid hardwoods from suppliers who derive their raw material from forests managed to the standards of FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification), SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) or equivalent, where replanting and controlled felling are part of the overall plan.

Taking a degree in [[history of architecture|architectural history]] from [[Cambridge University]] in 1978, he moved directly into working as a carpenter on building sites and set up a small workshop, trading as Bloomsbury Joinery, in [[London|London\u2019s]] [[Covent Garden]] that year<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. In 1981 he bought a former vegetable warehouse in the same district at a much reduced price because it was earmarked by the [[Greater London Council]] for compulsory purchase, demolition and redevelopment. (The Council was abolished<ref>{{cite report |author=Hansard|date=1803-2005 |title=Streamlining the Cities |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1984/may/22/streamlining-the-cities |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> before the plans could be realized.)\n\nIn the early 1980s the workshop\u2019s output consisted of high quality furniture for the residential market. Exposure to an increasing number of institutional clients came from a chance encounter with Colonel David Gordon-Lennox, commanding officer of the [[Grenadier Guards]], whose own kitchen shelving led to a commission for the regiment\u2019s archive library, and from there a series of bookcases for Inns of Court lawyers<ref>{{cite news |last=Steiner |first=Rupert |date=29 June 1997 |title=Carpenter carved out success by going against the grain | work=The Sunday Times}}</ref>. Many subsequent library commissions have included high-profile installations such as the library of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2009)<ref>{{Cite book |title=A visit to the Supreme Court Library |date=2011 |publisher=Inner Temple Newsletter|}}</ref>.\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the company\u2019s short-lived and ultimately ill-fated engagement with design for the retail market in the form of its robust but modestly priced \u2018Ovolo\u2019 range of bedroom furniture, sold through upmarket outlets such as [[Heal\u2019s]], [[Liberty\u2019s]] and [[John Lewis]]. [[Venture capital]] was raised and significant investment made in a factory in [[Wiltshire]] which opened in 1990. Copyright infringement and the deep UK recession of the late 1980s, which forced the factory\u2019s eventual closure in 1994, prompted a decision to target recession-proof clients with long-term needs to furnish their buildings of architectural quality \u2013\u00a0namely the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Much was owed in this strategic shift to Ray Leigh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GRDM-Newsletter-22.pdf|title=22nd e-newsletter of the Gordon Russell Design Museum|website=www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>, appointed chairman of the limited company in 1990, and an architect whose own background included work on the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951 and a long career, first as design director then managing director, of iconic [[Cotswold]] furniture manufacturer [[Gordon Russell (designer)|Gordon Russell]]<ref>{{Cite book | last=Leigh | first=Ray | title=Advance the Product |date=2015 |publisher=Gordon Russell Trust|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Myerson | first=Jeremy | title=Gordon Russell, Designer of Furniture |date=1992 |publisher=The Design Council of Great Britain|}}</ref>.

The first [[Oxbridge]] commission, of dining hall furniture for [[Corpus Christi College Cambridge]], came in 1991, a job which also marked the company\u2019s first use of computer-aided design<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>.

Although the company had been working expressly on those lines since the early 1990s, it was in 2013 \u2013 with the help of Craig Allen, former creative director at Linley Furniture and a senior buyer at the Conran Shop \u2013 that its brand messages were rationalised. \n\nThe greater part of Luke Hughes & Company furniture is designed for existing or historic buildings. Response to the architecture is key; an understanding of architecture and the design process, and sympathy for the architect who designed it, are central to its work. The pivotal idea behind Luke Hughes & Company\u2019s approach is that in any quality building, the connection between architecture and furniture should be seamless, creating a sense of \u201crightness\u201d, both functionally and aesthetically. Most buildings cannot function without the furniture, yet inappropriate furniture can grossly undermine great architecture<ref>{{cite news | last=Lim | first=Candice | date=2012 |title=In conversation with Luke Hughes | work=Futurarc: the Voice of Green Architecture in Asia | edition=vol 27 }}</ref>.  \n\nThe company\u2019s design practice is focused not only on responding to the aesthetic and functional qualities of the buildings that house its furniture, but also the economic outcomes. Analysis and re-arrangement of the leg positions on the tables in a dining hall such as New College Oxford<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=236}}</ref> or an overhaul of the seating geometry in a small historic theatre<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=150}}</ref> add capacity, improving the efficiency and profitability of the building.

The proposition is that the longer a building and its furniture stay relevant, the longer the carbon stays locked up, and the longer it stays locked up, the less CO2 emissions. Luke Hughes furniture is designed for long life, 30 \u2013 50 years minimum.  The strict company policy is to buy solid hardwoods from suppliers who derive their raw material from forests managed to the standards of FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification), SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) or equivalent, where replanting and controlled felling are part of the overall plan. Tree-planting schemes are actively supported and the company is a founder member of the Woodland Heritage Trust<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.woodlandheritage.org|title=Woodland Heritage website|website=woodlandheritage.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>. Timbers listed as endangered in the CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) are  not used.

The name Togo is translated from the [[Ewe language]] as \"land where lagoons lie\". Not much is known of the period before arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in 1490. During the period from the 11th century to the 16th century, various tribes entered the region from all directions: the [[Ewe people|Ew\u00e9]] from the west, and the [[Gen language|Mina]] and [[Fon language|Gun]] from the east. Most of them settled in coastal areas.\n\nThe [[slave trade]] began in the 16th century, and for the next two hundred years the coastal region was a major trading centre for Europeans in search of slaves, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name \"The [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]\".\n\n=== Colonial era (1884\u20131960) ===\n{{Main article|Togoland|British Togoland|French Togoland}}\n[[File:Togoland.jpg|thumb|left|Togoland ([[Rudolf Hellgrewe|R. Hellgrewe]], 1908)]]\n\nIn 1884, a paper was signed at [[Togoville]] with the King Mlapa III, whereby Germany claimed a [[protectorate]] over a stretch of territory along the coast and gradually extended its control inland. Its borders were defined after the capture of hinterland by German forces and signing agreements with France and Britain. In 1905, this became the [[German colonial empire|German colony]] of [[Togoland]]. The local population was forced to work, cultivate cotton, coffee and cocoa and pay high taxes. A railway and the port of [[Lom\u00e9]] were built for export of agricultural products. The Germans introduced modern techniques of cultivation of [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[coffee]] and [[cotton]] and developed the infrastructure.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], Togoland was invaded by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]], proclaiming the Anglo-French condominium. On 7 December 1916, the condominium collapsed and Togo was divided into British and French zones. 20 July 1922 Great Britain received the [[League of Nations]] mandate to govern the western part of Togo and France to govern the eastern part. In 1945, the country received the right to send three representatives to the French parliament.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], these mandates became [[United Nations Trust Territories|UN Trust Territories]]. The residents of [[British Togoland]] [[1956 British Togoland status plebiscite|voted]] to join the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as part of the new independent nation of [[Ghana]] in 1957. [[French Togoland]] became an autonomous republic within the [[French Union]] in 1959, while France retained the right to control the defense, foreign relations and finances.\n\n=== Independence to present day (1960\u2013present) ===\n[[File:Sylvanus Olympio.jpg|thumb|[[Sylvanus Olympio]]|left]]\n\nThe Togolese Republic was proclaimed on 27 April 1960.

A decree was issued on the dissolution of the opposition parties. Olympio tried to reduce dependence on France by establishing cooperation with the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[West Germany]]. He also rejected efforts of French soldiers who were demobilized after the [[Algerian War]] and tried to get a position in the Togolese army.

In May 1963 Grunitzky was [[Togolese general election, 1963|elected]] President of the Republic. The new leadership pursued a policy of developing relations with France. His main aim was to dampen the divisions between north and south, promulgate a new constitution, and introduce a multiparty system.\n\nExactly four years later, on  January 13 1967, Eyad\u00e9ma Gnassingb\u00e9 overthrew Grunitzky in a bloodless coup and assumed the presidency. He created the [[Rally of the Togolese People|Rally of the Togolese People Party]], banned activities of other political parties and introduced a one-party system in November 1969. He was reelected in [[Togolese general election, 1979|1979]] and [[Togolese presidential election, 1986|1986]]. In 1983, the [[privatization]] program launched and in 1991 other political parties were allowed. In 1993, the EU froze the partnership, describing Eyadema's re-election in [[Togolese presidential election, 1993|1993]], [[Togolese presidential election, 1998|1998]] and [[Togolese presidential election, 2003|2003]], as a seizure of power.

The opposition declared that the election results were fraudulent. The events of 2005 led to questions regarding the government's commitment to [[democracy]] that had been made in an attempt to normalize relations with the [[European Union|EU]], which cut off [[aid]] in 1993 due to questions about Togo's human rights situation. In addition, up to 400 people were killed in the violence surrounding the presidential elections, according to the [[United Nations|UN]]. Around 40,000 Togolese fled to neighboring countries.

It borders the [[Bight of Benin]] in the south; [[Ghana]] lies to the west; [[Benin]] to the east; and to the north, Togo is bound by [[Burkina Faso]]. Togo lies mostly between latitudes [[6th parallel north|6\u00b0]] and [[11th parallel north|11\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[prime meridian|0\u00b0]] and [[2nd meridian east|2\u00b0E]].\n\nThe coast of Togo in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] is 56&nbsp;km long and consists of lagoons with sandy beaches. In the north, the land is characterized by a gently rolling [[savanna]] in contrast to the center of the country, which is characterized by hills. The south of Togo is characterized by a [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic|savanna and woodland plateau]] which reaches to a coastal plain with extensive lagoons and marshes.\n\nThe highest [[mountain]] of the country is the [[Mont Agou]] at 986 m above sea level. The longest [[river]] is the [[Mono River]] with a length of 400&nbsp;km. It runs from north to south.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{main|Climate of Togo}}\nThe climate is generally tropical with average temperatures ranging from {{convert|23|\u00b0C}} on the coast to about {{convert|30|\u00b0C}} in the northernmost regions, with a dry climate and characteristics of a [[tropical savanna]]. To the south, there are two seasons of rain (the first between April and July and the second between September and November), even though the average rainfall is not very high.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\nThe coast of Togo is characterized by [[marshes]] and [[mangroves]]. High human population growth is leading to rapid [[deforestation]], endangering many species. At least four parks and reserves have been established: [[Abdoulaye Faunal Reserve]], [[Fazao Malfakassa National Park]], [[Fosse aux Lions National Park]], [[Koutammouko]], and [[K\u00e9ran National Park]].

Major crops are [[cassava]], [[jasmine rice]], [[maize]] and [[millet]]. Other important sectors are [[brewery]] and the [[textile]] industry. A permanent problem is the lack of [[electricity]], because the country is able to produce only about a third of its consumption, the rest is covered by imports from [[Ghana]] and [[Nigeria]]. Low market prices for Togo's major export commodities, however, coupled with the volatile political situation of the 1990s and early 2000s, had a negative effect on the economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://britannica.com/place/Togo#toc55354|title=Britannica|website=Britannica.org|accessdate=2017-08-26}}</ref>\n\nTogo is one of the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]]; the economic situation is still precarious. Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade center. The government's decade-long efforts, supported by the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), to carry out economic reforms, to encourage investment, and to create the balance between income and consumption has stalled. Political unrest, including private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, jeopardized the reform program, shrank the tax base, and disrupted vital economic activity.\n\nTogo imports [[machinery]], equipment, [[petroleum]] products, and [[food]]. Main import partners are [[France]] (21.1%), the [[Netherlands]] (12.1%), [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] (5.9%), [[Germany]] (4.6%), [[Italy]] (4.4%), [[South Africa]] (4.3%) and [[China]] (4.1%). The main exports are [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[coffee]], re-export of goods, [[phosphates]] and [[cotton]]. Major export partners are [[Burkina Faso]] (16.6%), [[China]] (15.4%), the [[Netherlands]] (13%), [[Benin]] (9.6%) and [[Mali]] (7.4%).\n\n[[File:Togo-pedaleamundo.jpg|thumb|Togolese fishermen]]\nIn terms of structural reforms, Togo has made progress in the [[liberalization]] of the economy, namely in the fields of [[trade]] and port activities. However, the privatization program of the cotton sector, [[telecommunications]] and water supply has stalled. The country currently has no debt due to financial assistance from the outside while Togo is likely among the most beneficiary countries under the Initiative help in [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]].\n\n12 January 1994 devaluation of the currency by 50% provided an important impetus to renewed structural adjustment; these efforts were facilitated by the end of strife in 1994 and a return to overt political calm. Progress depends on increased openness in government financial operations (to accommodate increased social service outlays) and possible downsizing of the [[armed forces]], on which the regime has depended to stay in place. Lack of aid, along with depressed cocoa prices, generated a 1% fall in GDP in 1998, with growth resuming in 1999.

Togo has the fourth largest [[phosphate]] deposits in the world. Their production is 2.1 million tons per year. Since the mid-90s, however, there has been a decline in the mining industry and government will need to invest heavily to sustain it. The mining industry is facing difficulties due to falling phosphate prices on world markets and increasing foreign competition. There are also reserves of [[limestone]], [[marble]] and [[salt]]. \n\nIndustry provides only 20.4% of Togo's national income, because it consists only of a few light industries and builders. Large reserves of limestone allows Togo to produce [[cement]].<ref name=\"cia.gov\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Togo|title=Togo {{!}} Location, History, Population, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Togo}}\n[[File:Danseuses-Adossa.JPG|thumb|Women in [[Sokod\u00e9]].]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"4\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\"|Population{{UN_Population|ref}}\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Million\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1950 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|1.4\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|5.0\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{UN_Population|Year}} ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|{{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Togo}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}}\n|}\nThe November 2010 census gave Togo a population of 6,191,155, more than double the total counted in the last census.

Sculptures and hunting trophies were used rather than the more ubiquitous African masks. The wood-carvers of [[Kloto]] are famous for their \"chains of marriage\": two characters are connected by rings drawn from only one piece of wood.\n\nThe dyed fabric [[batik]]s of the artisanal center of Kloto represent stylized and colored scenes of ancient everyday life. The loincloths used in the ceremonies of the weavers of Assahoun are famous. Works of the painter Sokey Edorh are inspired by the immense arid extents, swept by the dry wind, and where the soil keeps the prints of the men and the animals. The plastics technician [[Paul Ahyi]] is internationally recognized today. He practiced the \"[[zota]]\", a kind of pyroengraving, and his monumental achievements decorate [[Lom\u00e9]].\n\nThe official Togolese drink is called [[:fr:Sodabi|sodabi]], a liquor that is created from the distillation of palm wine.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Emmanuel Adebayor.jpg|thumb|Footballer [[Emmanuel Adebayor]].]]\n\n====Olympics====\n{{main|Togo at the Olympics}}\nOn 12 August 2008, [[Benjamin Boukpeti]] (born to a Togolese father and a French mother) won a bronze medal in the Men's K1 Kayak Slalom, the first medal ever won by a member of the Togolese team at the [[Olympics]].\n\n====Football====\n{{main|Football in Togo}}\nFootball is the most recognized and national sport of Togo.

He successfully played in the German Bundesliga for more than 14 years and is a living legend for the German Clubs Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and MSV Duisburg, where they even perpetuated him in their stadium. Salou gained 38 caps for Togo during a nine-year span. He played 300 games and scored 69 goals in the German major league.\n[[Emmanuel Adebayor]] is the most famous footballer for Togo, scoring 30 goals for the national team and 97 in the English Premier League.\n\n====Basketball====\n{{main|Togo national basketball team}}\n\n===Media===\n{{main|Media of Togo}}\n\n===Celebrations===\nTogo has secular celebrations.

While the official language is French, many other languages are spoken, particularly those of the [[Gbe languages|Gbe family]]. The largest [[Religious denomination|religious group]] consists of those with indigenous beliefs, and there are significant [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Muslims|Muslim]] minorities. Togo is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[African Union]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], [[South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]], and [[Economic Community of West African States]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Togo}}\n\n=== Before colonization (pre-1884) ===\nArchaeological finds indicate that ancient tribes were able to produce [[pottery]] and process [[iron]]. The name Togo is translated from the [[Ewe language]] as \"land where lagoons lie\". Not much is known of the period before arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in 1490. During the period from the 11th century to the 16th century, various tribes entered the region from all directions: the [[Ewe people|Ew\u00e9]] from the west, and the [[Gen language|Mina]] and [[Fon language|Gun]] from the east. Most of them settled in coastal areas.\n\nThe [[slave trade]] began in the 16th century, and for the next two hundred years the coastal region was a major trading centre for Europeans in search of slaves, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name \"The [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]\".\n\n=== Colonial era (1884\u20131960) ===\n{{Main article|Togoland|British Togoland|French Togoland}}\n[[File:Togoland.jpg|thumb|left|Togoland ([[Rudolf Hellgrewe|R. Hellgrewe]], 1908)]]\n\nIn 1884, a paper was signed at [[Togoville]] with the King Mlapa III, whereby Germany claimed a [[protectorate]] over a stretch of territory along the coast and gradually extended its control inland. Its borders were defined after the capture of hinterland by German forces and signing agreements with France and Britain. In 1905, this became the [[German colonial empire|German colony]] of [[Togoland]]. The local population was forced to work, cultivate cotton, coffee and cocoa and pay high taxes. A railway and the port of [[Lom\u00e9]] were built for export of agricultural products. The Germans introduced modern techniques of cultivation of [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[coffee]] and [[cotton]] and developed the infrastructure.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], Togoland was invaded by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]], proclaiming the Anglo-French condominium. On 7 December 1916, the condominium collapsed and Togo was divided into British and French zones. 20 July 1922 Great Britain received the [[League of Nations]] mandate to govern the western part of Togo and France to govern the eastern part. In 1945, the country received the right to send three representatives to the French parliament.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], these mandates became [[United Nations Trust Territories|UN Trust Territories]]. The residents of [[British Togoland]] [[1956 British Togoland status plebiscite|voted]] to join the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as part of the new independent nation of [[Ghana]] in 1957. [[French Togoland]] became an autonomous republic within the [[French Union]] in 1959, while France retained the right to control the defense, foreign relations and finances.\n\n=== Independence to present day (1960\u2013present) ===\n[[File:Sylvanus Olympio.jpg|thumb|[[Sylvanus Olympio]]|left]]\n\nThe Togolese Republic was proclaimed on 27 April 1960.  In the [[Togolese general election, 1961|first presidential elections]] in 1961, [[Sylvanus Olympio]] became the first president, gaining 100% of the vote in elections boycotted by the opposition. On  April 9 1961 the Constitution of the Togolese Republic was adopted, according to which the supreme legislative body was the [[National Assembly of Togo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ujamaalive.africa/encyclomedia/togo/|title=Togo|date=2019-04-26|website=Ujamaa Live|language=en-ZA|access-date=2019-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502190520/https://ujamaalive.africa/encyclomedia/togo/|archive-date=2 May 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1961, leaders of opposition parties were arrested because they were accused of the preparation of an anti-government conspiracy. A decree was issued on the dissolution of the opposition parties. Olympio tried to reduce dependence on France by establishing cooperation with the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[West Germany]]. He also rejected efforts of French soldiers who were demobilized after the [[Algerian War]] and tried to get a position in the Togolese army. These factors eventually led to a military coup on  January 13 1963, during which he was [[assassinate]]d by a group of soldiers under the direction of Sergeant [[Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma]].<ref name=\"ellis93\">{{cite journal | last = Ellis | first = Stephen | title = Rumour and Power in Togo | journal = Africa: Journal of the International African Institute | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 462\u2013476 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1993 | jstor = 1161002 }}</ref> A State of emergency was declared in Togo.\n\nThe military handed over power to an interim government led by [[Nicolas Grunitzky]]. In May 1963 Grunitzky was [[Togolese general election, 1963|elected]] President of the Republic. The new leadership pursued a policy of developing relations with France. His main aim was to dampen the divisions between north and south, promulgate a new constitution, and introduce a multiparty system.\n\nExactly four years later, on  January 13 1967, Eyad\u00e9ma Gnassingb\u00e9 overthrew Grunitzky in a bloodless coup and assumed the presidency. He created the [[Rally of the Togolese People|Rally of the Togolese People Party]], banned activities of other political parties and introduced a one-party system in November 1969. He was reelected in [[Togolese general election, 1979|1979]] and [[Togolese presidential election, 1986|1986]]. In 1983, the [[privatization]] program launched and in 1991 other political parties were allowed. In 1993, the EU froze the partnership, describing Eyadema's re-election in [[Togolese presidential election, 1993|1993]], [[Togolese presidential election, 1998|1998]] and [[Togolese presidential election, 2003|2003]], as a seizure of power.

The opposition declared that the election results were fraudulent. The events of 2005 led to questions regarding the government's commitment to [[democracy]] that had been made in an attempt to normalize relations with the [[European Union|EU]], which cut off [[aid]] in 1993 due to questions about Togo's human rights situation. In addition, up to 400 people were killed in the violence surrounding the presidential elections, according to the [[United Nations|UN]]. Around 40,000 Togolese fled to neighboring countries. Gnassingb\u00e9 was reelected in [[Togolese presidential election, 2010|2010]] and [[Togolese presidential election, 2015|2015]].\n\nIn late 2017, [[Anti-government protests in Togo, 2017|anti-government protests]] erupted in Togo, the biggest since those after the [[Togolese presidential election, 2005|2005 election]]. Protesters demanded the resignation of Gnassingb\u00e9, who is part of a family they alleged has been in power too long. The UN condemned the resulting crackdown by Togolese security forces, and [[The Gambia|Gambia's]] foreign minister, [[Ousainou Darboe]], had to issue a correction after saying that Gnassingb\u00e9 should resign.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-togo/togos-president-gnassingbe-should-resign-immediately-gambian-foreign-minister-idUSKBN1CS1W7|title=Gambian ministry says up to Togo to resolve crisis|last=Farge|first=Emma|date=2017-10-23|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-10-26|publisher=Thomson Reuters}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Togo}}\n{{ multiple images\n| align=right\n|image1=Ghana Topography.png\n|caption1 =Ghana-Togo [[topography]]\u2212[[topographic map]]\n|image2=To-map.png\n|caption2=Map of Togo\n|total_width=330\n}}\nTogo has an area equal to {{convert|21925|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and is one of the smallest countries in Africa. It borders the [[Bight of Benin]] in the south; [[Ghana]] lies to the west; [[Benin]] to the east; and to the north, Togo is bound by [[Burkina Faso]]. Togo lies mostly between latitudes [[6th parallel north|6\u00b0]] and [[11th parallel north|11\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[prime meridian|0\u00b0]] and [[2nd meridian east|2\u00b0E]].\n\nThe coast of Togo in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] is 56&nbsp;km long and consists of lagoons with sandy beaches. In the north, the land is characterized by a gently rolling [[savanna]] in contrast to the center of the country, which is characterized by hills. The south of Togo is characterized by a [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic|savanna and woodland plateau]] which reaches to a coastal plain with extensive lagoons and marshes.\n\nThe highest [[mountain]] of the country is the [[Mont Agou]] at 986 m above sea level. The longest [[river]] is the [[Mono River]] with a length of 400&nbsp;km. It runs from north to south.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{main|Climate of Togo}}\nThe climate is generally tropical with average temperatures ranging from {{convert|23|\u00b0C}} on the coast to about {{convert|30|\u00b0C}} in the northernmost regions, with a dry climate and characteristics of a [[tropical savanna]]. To the south, there are two seasons of rain (the first between April and July and the second between September and November), even though the average rainfall is not very high.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\nThe coast of Togo is characterized by [[marshes]] and [[mangroves]]. High human population growth is leading to rapid [[deforestation]], endangering many species. At least four parks and reserves have been established: [[Abdoulaye Faunal Reserve]], [[Fazao Malfakassa National Park]], [[Fosse aux Lions National Park]], [[Koutammouko]], and [[K\u00e9ran National Park]]. The most frequently observed animals are [[giraffes]], [[cape buffalo]], [[hyenas]], and [[lions]]. Few elephants remain.

Gravely ill, he was being transported by plane to a foreign country for care. He died in transit while over Tunisia. Under the Togolese Constitution, the President of the Parliament, [[Fambar\u00e9 Ouattara Natchaba]], should have become President of the country, pending a new presidential election to be called within sixty days.

Cotton is the most important cash crop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefactfile.org/togo-facts/|title=The Fact File|website=factfile.org|accessdate=2018-08-06}}</ref> The fertile land occupies 11.3% of the country, most of which is developed. Major crops are [[cassava]], [[jasmine rice]], [[maize]] and [[millet]]. Other important sectors are [[brewery]] and the [[textile]] industry. A permanent problem is the lack of [[electricity]], because the country is able to produce only about a third of its consumption, the rest is covered by imports from [[Ghana]] and [[Nigeria]]. Low market prices for Togo's major export commodities, however, coupled with the volatile political situation of the 1990s and early 2000s, had a negative effect on the economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://britannica.com/place/Togo#toc55354|title=Britannica|website=Britannica.org|accessdate=2017-08-26}}</ref>\n\nTogo is one of the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]]; the economic situation is still precarious. Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade center. The government's decade-long efforts, supported by the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), to carry out economic reforms, to encourage investment, and to create the balance between income and consumption has stalled. Political unrest, including private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, jeopardized the reform program, shrank the tax base, and disrupted vital economic activity.\n\nTogo imports [[machinery]], equipment, [[petroleum]] products, and [[food]]. Main import partners are [[France]] (21.1%), the [[Netherlands]] (12.1%), [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] (5.9%), [[Germany]] (4.6%), [[Italy]] (4.4%), [[South Africa]] (4.3%) and [[China]] (4.1%). The main exports are [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[coffee]], re-export of goods, [[phosphates]] and [[cotton]]. Major export partners are [[Burkina Faso]] (16.6%), [[China]] (15.4%), the [[Netherlands]] (13%), [[Benin]] (9.6%) and [[Mali]] (7.4%).\n\n[[File:Togo-pedaleamundo.jpg|thumb|Togolese fishermen]]\nIn terms of structural reforms, Togo has made progress in the [[liberalization]] of the economy, namely in the fields of [[trade]] and port activities. However, the privatization program of the cotton sector, [[telecommunications]] and water supply has stalled. The country currently has no debt due to financial assistance from the outside while Togo is likely among the most beneficiary countries under the Initiative help in [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]].\n\n12 January 1994 devaluation of the currency by 50% provided an important impetus to renewed structural adjustment; these efforts were facilitated by the end of strife in 1994 and a return to overt political calm. Progress depends on increased openness in government financial operations (to accommodate increased social service outlays) and possible downsizing of the [[armed forces]], on which the regime has depended to stay in place. Lack of aid, along with depressed cocoa prices, generated a 1% fall in GDP in 1998, with growth resuming in 1999.

Since the mid-90s, however, there has been a decline in the mining industry and government will need to invest heavily to sustain it. The mining industry is facing difficulties due to falling phosphate prices on world markets and increasing foreign competition. There are also reserves of [[limestone]], [[marble]] and [[salt]]. \n\nIndustry provides only 20.4% of Togo's national income, because it consists only of a few light industries and builders.

There is no record of what became of the Ark in the Books of Kings and Chronicles.  An ancient Greek version of the biblical third Book of Ezra, [[1 Esdras]], suggests that Babylonians took away the vessels of the ark of God, but does not mention taking away the Ark:<ref>{{bible|1 Esdras|1:54}}</ref>\n{{quote|And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king's treasures, and carried them away into Babylon}}\n\nIn [[Rabbinic literature]], the final disposition of the Ark is disputed. Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ark of the Covenant |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1777-ark-of-the-covenant#anchor10 |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref> A late 2nd-century rabbinic work known as the ''[[Tosefta]]'' states the opinions of these rabbis that [[Josiah]], the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of [[manna]], and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines.<ref>Tosefta (''Sotah'' 13:1); cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Kereithot'' 5b)</ref> This was said to have been done in order to prevent their being carried off into Babylon as had already happened to the other vessels. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon, in the same rabbinic work, state that the Ark was, in fact, taken into Babylon. Rabbi Yehudah, dissenting, says that the Ark was stored away in its own place, meaning, somewhere on the Temple Mount.\n\n==Archaeology==\nArchaeological evidence shows strong cultic activity at [[Kiriath-Jearim]] in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, well after the ark was supposedly removed from there to Jerusalem. In particular, archaeologists found a large elevated podium, associated with the Northern Kingdom and not the Southern Kingdom, which may have been a shrine. [[Thomas R\u00f6mer]] suggests that this may indicate that the ark was not moved to Jerusalem until much later, possibly during the reign of [[King Josiah]].  He notes that this might explain why the ark featured prominently in the history before Solomon, but not after. Additionally, 2 Chronicles 35:3<ref>{{bible|2 Chronicles|35:3}}</ref> indicates that it was moved during King Josiah's reign.<ref name=David>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/MAGAZINE-the-real-ark-of-the-covenant-may-have-housed-pagan-gods-1.5446116|title=The Real Ark of the Covenant may have Housed Pagan Gods|newspaper=Haaretz|author=Ariel David|date=30 Aug 2017}}</ref> Some scholars believe the story of the Ark was written independently around the 8th century in a text referred to as the \"Ark Narrative\" and then incorporated into the main biblical narrative just before the exile into Babylon.<ref>K. L. Sparks, \"Ark of the Covenant\" in Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Historical Books'' (InterVarsity Press, 2005), 91.</ref>\n\nThomas R\u00f6mer also suggests that the ark may have originally carried sacred stones \"of the kind found in the chests of pre-Islamic Bedouins\", and speculates that these may have been either a statue of Yahweh or a pair of statues depicting both Yahweh and his companion goddess Asherah.<ref>Thomas R\u00f6mer, ''The Invention of God'' (Harvard University Press, 2015), 93.</ref> In contrast, Scott Noegel has argued that the parallels between the ark and these practices \"remain unconvincing\" in part because the Bedouin objects lack the ark's distinctive structure, function, and mode of transportation. Specifically, unlike the ark, the Bedouin chests \"contained no box, no lid, and no poles,\" they did not serve as the throne or footstool of a god, they were not overlaid with gold, did not have [[kerubim]] figures upon them, there were no restrictions on who could touch them, and they were transported on horses or camels. Noegel suggests that the ancient Egyptian [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|bark]] is a more plausible model for the Israelite ark, since Egyptian barks had all the features just mentioned. Noegel adds that the Egyptians also were known to place written covenants beneath the feet of statues, proving a further parallel to the placement of the covenental tablets inside the ark.<ref>Scott Noegel, \"The Egyptian Origin of the Ark of the Covenant\" in Thomas E.

Kirjath-jearim remained the abode of the Ark for twenty years. Under Saul, the Ark was with the army before he first met the Philistines, but the king was too impatient to consult it before engaging in battle.

There is no record of what became of the Ark in the Books of Kings and Chronicles.  An ancient Greek version of the biblical third Book of Ezra, [[1 Esdras]], suggests that Babylonians took away the vessels of the ark of God, but does not mention taking away the Ark:<ref>{{bible|1 Esdras|1:54}}</ref>\n{{quote|And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king's treasures, and carried them away into Babylon}}\n\nIn [[Rabbinic literature]], the final disposition of the Ark is disputed. Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ark of the Covenant |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1777-ark-of-the-covenant#anchor10 |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref> A late 2nd-century rabbinic work known as the ''[[Tosefta]]'' states the opinions of these rabbis that [[Josiah]], the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of [[manna]], and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines.<ref>Tosefta (''Sotah'' 13:1); cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Kereithot'' 5b)</ref> This was said to have been done in order to prevent their being carried off into Babylon as had already happened to the other vessels. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon, in the same rabbinic work, state that the Ark was, in fact, taken into Babylon. Rabbi Yehudah, dissenting, says that the Ark was stored away in its own place, meaning, somewhere on the Temple Mount.\n\n==Archaeology==\nArchaeological evidence shows strong cultic activity at [[Kiriath-Jearim]] in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, well after the ark was supposedly removed from there to Jerusalem. In particular, archaeologists found a large elevated podium, associated with the Northern Kingdom and not the Southern Kingdom, which may have been a shrine. [[Thomas R\u00f6mer]] suggests that this may indicate that the ark was not moved to Jerusalem until much later, possibly during the reign of [[King Josiah]].  He notes that this might explain why the ark featured prominently in the history before Solomon, but not after. Additionally, 2 Chronicles 35:3<ref>{{bible|2 Chronicles|35:3}}</ref> indicates that it was moved during King Josiah's reign.<ref name=David>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/MAGAZINE-the-real-ark-of-the-covenant-may-have-housed-pagan-gods-1.5446116|title=The Real Ark of the Covenant may have Housed Pagan Gods|newspaper=Haaretz|author=Ariel David|date=30 Aug 2017}}</ref> Some scholars believe the story of the Ark was written independently around the 8th century in a text referred to as the \"Ark Narrative\" and then incorporated into the main biblical narrative just before the exile into Babylon.<ref>K. L. Sparks, \"Ark of the Covenant\" in Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Historical Books'' (InterVarsity Press, 2005), 91.</ref>\n\nThomas R\u00f6mer also suggests that the ark may have originally carried sacred stones \"of the kind found in the chests of pre-Islamic Bedouins\", and speculates that these may have been either a statue of Yahweh or a pair of statues depicting both Yahweh and his companion goddess Asherah.<ref>Thomas R\u00f6mer, ''The Invention of God'' (Harvard University Press, 2015), 93.</ref> In contrast, Scott Noegel has argued that the parallels between the ark and these practices \"remain unconvincing\" in part because the Bedouin objects lack the ark's distinctive structure, function, and mode of transportation. Specifically, unlike the ark, the Bedouin chests \"contained no box, no lid, and no poles,\" they did not serve as the throne or footstool of a god, they were not overlaid with gold, did not have [[kerubim]] figures upon them, there were no restrictions on who could touch them, and they were transported on horses or camels. Noegel suggests that the ancient Egyptian [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|bark]] is a more plausible model for the Israelite ark, since Egyptian barks had all the features just mentioned. Noegel adds that the Egyptians also were known to place written covenants beneath the feet of statues, proving a further parallel to the placement of the covenental tablets inside the ark.<ref>Scott Noegel, \"The Egyptian Origin of the Ark of the Covenant\" in Thomas E. Levy, Thomas Schneider, and William H.C.

The story depicts the character's 19-year-long struggle to lead a normal life after serving a prison sentence for stealing bread to feed his sister's children during a time of [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] and various attempts to escape from prison. Valjean is also known in the novel as '''Monsieur Madeleine''', '''Ultime Fauchelevent''', '''Monsieur Leblanc''', and '''Urbain Fabre.'''\n\nValjean and police Inspector [[Javert]], who repeatedly encounters Valjean and attempts to return him to prison, have become archetypes in literary culture. In the popular imagination, the character of Jean Valjean came to represent Hugo himself.\n\nIn 1871, when Hugo was living in Brussels during the radical revolt known as the [[Paris Commune]],  anti-revolutionary mobs attacked his house and broke windows shouting \"Down with Jean Valjean!\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Behr |first=Edward |title=The Complete Book of Les Mis\u00e9rables|year=1989|publisher=Arcade|location=NY|page=24}}</ref>\n\n== Outline of the novel ==\nAs a [[parolee]], Valjean is issued a yellow passport with marching orders to [[Pontarlier]], where he will be forced to live under severe restrictions. This document, often called a \"passeport jaune\" (yellow passport), identifies him to all as a former convict and immediately brands Valjean an outcast wherever he travels. His life turns around when [[Bishop Myriel]] of [[Digne]], from whom he steals valuable silverware, tells the police that he has given the treasure to Valjean. Out of this encounter, Valjean becomes a [[repentant]], honorable, and dignified man. He becomes kind, a devoted father-figure to a girl who loses her mother, [[Cosette]], and a benefactor to those in need. Although a known criminal and a parolee, Valjean yet grows morally to represent the best traits of humanity. Despite being classified as a criminal outcast, Valjean maintains the highest of human virtues and ethics.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nHis antithesis, [[Javert]], a dedicated and capable police officer, occupies a place of honour in society. The relationship of Javert and Valjean develops as a binary opposition between law and love. Javert sees Valjean only as the convict he once was, rather than the benefactor of humanity he has become. Javert's struggle against this dichotomy leads to his eventual suicide.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n== In the novel ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}\n\n=== Part One: Fantine ===\nAfter devoting the novel's opening chapters to [[Bishop Myriel]], a kind-hearted old clergyman in the town of Digne, Hugo, without any transition, launches into the story of Valjean. He is a strange man, who arrives one October evening in [[Digne]], searches for a place to stay the night and is turned away. At last he is taken in by the bishop, who trusts him, feeds him supper, and gives him a bed for the night. Hugo then details Valjean's background. He was born sometime in 1769 in a small town and orphaned as a child. He became a pruner and helped support his widowed sister and her seven children. In the winter of 1795, when resources were scarce, Valjean stole a loaf of bread from a local baker by breaking the [[window]]. He was caught and imprisoned for five years in the [[Bagne of Toulon]], the Toulon prison. He attempted to escape four times, and each time his sentence was lengthened by three years; he also received an extra two years for once resisting recapture during his second escape. After nineteen years in prison, he was released, but by law must carry a yellow passport that announces he is an ex-convict.\n\nDuring the night, he awakens and steals the bishop's silverware and silver plates, and runs off. He is arrested and brought back to the bishop. However, the Bishop admonishes Valjean (in front of the police) for forgetting to also take the silver candlesticks that he'd given Valjean, reminding Valjean of his \"promise\" to use the silver to become an honest man, claiming to have bought Valjean's soul with it, withdrawing it from evil and giving it to God. Despite the Bishop's words, it is later revealed that the police marked the event down in Valjean's permanent record.\n\nBewildered and not understanding what the bishop is talking about, Jean Valjean heads instead back out into the nearby mountains and meets a young traveling worker from Savoy named [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Petit Gervais]]. Valjean places his foot on a coin that Petit Gervais drops, then refuses to return it, despite Gervais' protests, and threatens to beat him. When the boy flees the scene and Valjean comes to his senses, remembering what the bishop told him, he is ashamed of what he has done and searches for the boy in vain.\n\nHugo introduces [[Fantine]] and explains how she came to be abandoned by her child's father. In late 1815, Jean Valjean, now using the name Madeleine, arrives in [[Montreuil-sur-Mer]]. He revolutionizes the town's manufacturing and earns a fortune, which he spends mostly for the town's good, paying for the maintenance (including required staff) of hospital beds, orphanages and schools. He is appointed mayor after refusing the first time. He declines the king's offer to make him a [[Legion of honor#First Empire|Knight of the Legion of Honor]].\n\nMadeleine (Valjean) saves an old man named [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Fauchelevent]] from death. Fauchelevent had fallen beneath his wagon as his horse fell and broke two of its legs. Madeleine offers to pay anyone who could raise the wagon but nobody wants to risk his life climbing under the wagon. Javert, who witnessed the scene, tells Madeleine that he had only known of one man capable of doing such a feat, and that was a convict doing forced labor in Toulon. Madeleine turns pale, but gets down into the mud and lifts the wagon off Fauchelevent. Since Fauchelevent had earlier lost his business and now had a broken kneecap, Madeleine (Valjean) arranges a job at a convent for Fauchelevent. Valjean also brings the broken cart and horse as an excuse to give Fauchelevent money.\n\nLater, Javert arrests Fantine, who has become a prostitute, when he sees her scratch and try to hit a bourgeois named [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Bamatabois]], who had taunted Fantine and thrown snow down her dress while she walked back and forth trying to get business. Valjean was told what had happened and knew that Bamatabois should have been the one arrested and ordered Fantine free. Javert knew only what he'd seen and was furious with Valjean for interfering with police work. When Valjean orders Javert to leave in front of Javert's squad, Javert leaves and denounces \"Madeleine\" to the prefect of police at Paris, saying that he suspects Madeleine is Valjean. Javert is told that he must be incorrect because the \"real\" Jean Valjean (who is in reality [[Champmathieu]]) had just been found.\n\nValjean takes Fantine to the local hospital (which is on the side of the mayor's house) and has her cared for. He learns of Cosette, Fantine's daughter, and tries to pay off the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]] (who are abusing Cosette).\n\nJavert then apologizes to \"M. Madeleine\", and tells him that the \"real\" Jean Valjean has been found and is to be tried the next day. Javert also asks that he be [[Termination of employment|dismissed]] in disgrace by Valjean from his job for acting out of revenge incorrectly, saying that since he had been hard on others he could not be less harsh on himself but after Valjean repeatedly refuses, Javert says he will continue acting as police chief until a replacement can be found.\n\nIt is only here that the novel finally reveals Madeleine to be Valjean, a fact which was heavily [[foreshadowing|foreshadowed]] before.\n\n[[File:\u00c9mile Bayard - Il lui ferma les yeux.jpg|thumb|left|The death of Fantine; Valjean (as Monsieur Madeleine) closes her eyes.]]\nThat night, Valjean has a terrific struggle within himself, but finally decides to go to the trial and reveal his identity in order to free Champmathieu (for, if he gave himself up, who would care for Fantine or rescue Cosette?). He gives his evidence and proves that he is the real Jean Valjean, but nobody wants to arrest him, so Valjean says that they know where to find him and he returns to Montreuil-sur-Mer. The judge at the trial, although quite impressed with M. Madeleine's work and reputation, is shocked that Valjean, while mentioning a date that another convict had tattooed on himself (in order to prove that M. Madeleine was actually Jean Valjean) called [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]] \"the Emperor\" instead of \"Bonaparte\" and orders Valjean arrested for robbing Petit Gervais. Javert comes to arrest him the next day while Valjean is in Fantine's room. Valjean asks for three days to get Cosette from Montfermeil and give her to Fantine before he is arrested and Javert refuses, saying that it would be too easy for Valjean to escape. Fantine (who'd been told by the doctors that Valjean, who'd been at the trial, had been getting her daughter) was shocked to find that her daughter was not there already and that her savior was being arrested, and died of shock (her body had been greatly weakened by her poor living conditions and long illness, probably [[tuberculosis]]).\n\nValjean allows Javert to arrest him, but quickly escapes. It is hinted that Valjean escaped with the help of a file hidden in a coin, an item he is later proved to possess. Valjean returns to his house to pack his clothes and hides behind the door when Javert comes looking for him. [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Sister Simplice]], one of the hospital nuns, who had a reputation for never having told a lie in her life, twice lied to Javert that there was nobody there but her to protect Valjean. Javert believed her and left, giving Valjean an opportunity to escape the town.\n\n=== Part Two: Cosette ===\n\nA short chapter, mainly consisting of two newspaper articles, informs the reader, that Jean Valjean has been re-arrested while getting into the stagecoach to [[Montfermeil]] (on his way to get Fantine's eight-year-old daughter, [[Cosette]], whom he had promised to rescue). In July 1823, he was condemned to death for the 40-sous theft and the escape from the jail in Montreuil-sur-Mer, as the prosecutor claims that Valjean was part of a gang of street robbers and the latter refuses to defend himself. His sentence was graciously reduced by the king to only life in prison instead of death. Before he was captured, Jean Valjean had already traveled near to Montfermeil and buried all the money he'd saved as M. Madeleine\u2014a chapter tells of a worker in [[Montfermeil]], a former Toulon convict, who claims having seen, according to a local fairy tale, the devil burying his treasure in the forest. No further explanation is ever given as to why, having buried his money near Montfermeil, Valjean had traveled back to Paris and then attempted to travel back to Montfermeil.\n\nValjean was assigned a new number of 9430, but escapes from a sailing vessel after only a few months' imprisonment, on 16 November 1823, by apparently falling into the sea after a daring rescue of a sailor who had gotten stuck in a dangerous situation up in the ship's rigging. Thereafter he is officially presumed dead.\n\nValjean goes to Montfermeil, where he meets Cosette alone in the forest on [[Christmas Eve]], 1823. He accompanies her back to the inn; and watches that evening as the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]] mistreat her very badly. He sees the Th\u00e9nardiers' daughters [[\u00c9ponine]] and [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Azelma]] acting unkindly to her as well, tattling on her to their mother when she tries to play with their temporarily abandoned doll. After seeing this, Valjean briefly leaves the inn and returns with a beautiful new doll to give to Cosette, which she happily accepts. This makes Mme. Th\u00e9nardier furious with Valjean, affronted that he would do such a thing for Cosette instead of her own daughters. M. Th\u00e9nardier tells her that Valjean can do as he wishes as long as he pays them. That evening, Mme. Th\u00e9nardier insists that Cosette will be turned out onto the street the next day.\n\nThe next morning, [[Christmas Day]], Valjean offers to take Cosette with him. Mme. Th\u00e9nardier immediately accepts, but M. Th\u00e9nardier haggles for a compensation and gets 1500 francs in the end. Valjean takes Cosette with him. Only now does the book confirm that the mysterious man Cosette met is actually Jean Valjean. M. Th\u00e9nardier is soon overcome with grief at having sold Cosette too cheaply and runs after them. When M. Th\u00e9nardier demands more money, Valjean gives him the note Fantine signed before she died, saying that the bearer of the note was authorized to take Cosette. M. Th\u00e9nardier tries to continue following Valjean, but is soon frightened back to the inn.\n\nValjean takes Cosette to [[Paris]], where they live in No. 50-52 [[Boulevard de l'H\u00f4pital]], in the so-called \"Gorbeau House.\" They cannot live calmly for long\u2014in Spring 1824, Javert, who has been promoted to the police in Paris, finds the house. He has heard of a \"kidnapping\" from Montfermeil and remembers Valjean's request of three days. He has also heard of a man, poorly dressed, who gives money to other poor people, the \"beggar who gives alms\", who had a granddaughter with him and who has been heard to say that she came from Montfermeil. Javert goes undercover, discovers that it is Jean Valjean, and makes plans to arrest him.\n\nValjean recognizes Javert, and taking Cosette, walks out of the house and leaves. They barely manage to get away from Javert, who allowed Valjean to leave the house, believing that Valjean would take him to meet other criminals. Valjean managed to steal a rope from a streetlamp, climb a wall to a convent and pull Cosette up after him. They then climbed down a shed roof into a garden. it turned out that this was the convent where Fauchelevent worked, who wanted to return the favor and save Valjean's life this time. After almost burying Valjean alive in a scheme to get him out of the convent so that he could openly walk back into the convent, Fauchelevent was able to bring in his \"brother\" Ultimas (fr. Ultime) Fauchelevent (the real name of Fauchelevent's deceased brother). Cosette was admitted to the convent school.\n\n=== Part Three: Marius ===\n\nDuring this whole part, Valjean and Cosette are unnamed, as the action is seen from [[Marius Pontmercy]]'s point of view. They are described only as a father and daughter, whom Marius notices on his daily walks in the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]]. He ignores them at first, but later he and Cosette fall in love. Marius stalks the two until Valjean is alerted that someone is stalking them and moves from his house in Rue de l'Ouest (today [[Rue d'Assas]]).\n\nThey meet again by pure luck, six months later: Valjean is known for his generosity. As \"the generous man from the St-\u00c9tienne-church\", Th\u00e9nardier, Marius' neighbour, asks for charity. He recognises Valjean and decides to build a trap for him. Marius, overhearing the plans, denounces the plot to the police, unfortunately meeting Javert. Valjean walks right into the trap and attempts to escape Th\u00e9nardier once he realises this. Th\u00e9nardier forces Valjean to write a letter to Cosette, instructing her to come with the bearer. Valjean, however, gives Th\u00e9nardier a false name and address and manages to free himself of the ropes tying him with the help of a file concealed in a coin, which is found afterwards. He berates the gang for thinking that they could force him to tell something he does not want to tell and burns his own left forearm with the poker Th\u00e9nardier had used to threaten him before surrendering to the gang. It is at that moment that Javert enters the scene. Valjean manages to escape before the latter recognises him.\n\n=== Part Four: Saint-Denis ===\n\nOnly now is when Valjean's and Cosette's life during the last years revealed: They lived in the convent until Fauchelevent's death, and left in 1829; Cosette is fourteen years old. Valjean buys three houses (so that he will always have somewhere to flee to) in Rue de l'Ouest (today Rue D'Assas), Rue Plumet (today Rue Oudinot) and No. 7 Rue de l'Homme-Arm\u00e9 (today 40, rue des Archives), mostly living in Rue Plumet.\n\nValjean does not know that Cosette returns Marius' love and does not understand why Cosette seems less attached to \"her grandfather\" than before. He is happy to see that the brand wound he got during the attack makes her worry and care for him more. During one of their walks, they witness the passing of a chain gang being taken from Paris south. The event leaves a profound impression on Cosette and makes Valjean even more determined to stop his daughter from learning about his past.\n\nMarius, through \u00c9ponine, finds Cosette, stalks her house, leaves his daily love journal for her to find then one evening leaps over the gate and surprises her in the garden. They begin meeting every evening to gaze into each other's eyes. But it is also \u00c9ponine, jealous, who throws Valjean an anonymous note, telling him to move. Valjean, feeling threatened since the incident with Th\u00e9nardier and since he believes there has been a man hiding in his garden, decides to move to England. He takes Cosette to the house in the Rue de l'Homme-Arm\u00e9. This takes places during the first days of June 1832.\n\nIt is only there that he learns of Cosette's love for Marius when a young boy ([[Gavroche]]) delivers a letter from Marius to Cosette, which mentions that Marius is at the barricade and will die as he promised her, since she left without a forwarding address. Valjean has another long inward struggle, at first feeling relief about Marius' certain death, then guilt about his former feeling. He joins the rebellion without an actual decision about his following actions.\n\n=== Part Five: Valjean ===\n[[File:Lesmiserables 1900 valjean rescues Marius.jpg|thumb|Valjean rescues Marius through the sewers. Illustration by [[Mead Schaeffer]]]]\nValjean plays his part in the insurrection and proves an excellent shot. To thank him, [[Enjolras]], the barricade's leader, offers him anything he wants. Valjean asks that he be allowed to kill Javert, who has been captured as a spy. The request is granted and Valjean takes Javert out of sight to kill him but instead of executing him, sets him free, though Javert warns that he will still be bound to arrest Valjean. Valjean agrees and gives Javert his address. After Valjean releases Javert, the fighters on the barricades are all killed with the exception of Marius, whom Valjean carries to safety through miles of Parisian sewers. Valjean finds the sewer exit to the Grand-Caillou locked. Th\u00e9nardier is there and has the key. He offers Valjean the key in return for payment, believing that Valjean had killed Marius for his money. Valjean gives the few sous he has to Th\u00e9nardier and unlocks the sewer gate and encounters Javert, now returned to duty and in pursuit of Th\u00e9nardier. Valjean requests that Javert help him carry Marius to safety and Javert summons his carriage. Valjean asks permission to return home to say goodbye to Cosette and Javert agrees, saying that he will wait out front. As he walks up the stairs, Valjean looks out the window and notices that Javert is gone. Javert confronts his life spent in pursuit of a criminal who has demonstrated a sense of justice outside of the one that Javert has upheld his entire life. Unable to accept this, he commits suicide.\n\nAfter recovering from his injuries, Marius receives permission from his grandfather to marry Cosette and they wed. The day after the wedding, Valjean reveals to Marius that he is an ex-convict. Marius, horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean's character and begins pushing him out of Cosette's life. After this, Valjean's previously habitual visits to Cosette at Marius' grandfather's house become shorter and shorter, until he ceases to visit at all, having become bedridden with loss of will to live. Some time after he stops coming, Th\u00e9nardier visits Marius and claims that Valjean is a murderer and shows Marius several newspaper articles to prove this. Marius sees through Th\u00e9nardier's disguise and, in an attempt to show Marius something that he does not already know, Th\u00e9nardier shows newspaper clippings proving that M. Madeleine and Jean Valjean are the same person, and that Javert committed suicide. Marius is then told that Valjean was the man who had \"assassinated\" one of Marius' relatives, carrying the body through the sewers on 6 June. Realizing that Th\u00e9nardier had seen Valjean saving him, Marius finishes with Th\u00e9nardier and hurries with Cosette to Valjean's flat. Unfortunately, they are too late and find Valjean is dying. Valjean makes peace with Marius, with whom he had uneasy relations, and tells Cosette the name of her mother, Fantine. He dies content, under the light of the Bishop's candlesticks, and it is stated that an angel awaits to carry his soul to Heaven. He is buried in an unmarked grave, per his request, after death. Only these four lines appear on the gravestone:\n\n<poem>\n''Il dort. Quoique le sort f\u00fbt pour lui bien \u00e9trange,''\n''Il vivait. Il mourut quand il n'eut plus son ange;''\n''La chose simplement d'elle-m\u00eame arriva,''\n''Comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s'en va.''</poem>\n\n<poem>\nTranslation:\nHe sleeps.

The number appears only twice in the novel, and is never spoken by Javert.\n* Valjean's assumed name, Monsieur Madeleine, is used in the original French language [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|concept album]], but not in the later English version of the musical, where he is only called ''Monsieur le maire'' (Mr. Mayor). In the 2012 film adaptation of the musical, the factory foreman breaks up the fight between Fantine and the factory workers, announcing \"Monsieur Madeleine's here!\". The assumed name can also be seen on the door of his office.\n* In the novel, Valjean is arrested for the second time after confessing to be a parole-breaker in court. Javert later chases him for escaping prison. In the musical, Valjean neither gets arrested again nor escapes from prison.\n* Valjean and Cosette do not live in Gorbeau House and take refuge from Javert in a convent in the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|musical version]], but the 2012 movie depicts Valjean inadvertently entering the convent with Cosette while escaping Javert, where he then encounters Fauchelevent. The Gorbeau House episode with the Thenardiers is also omitted in the musical and film adaptation. Instead, Thenardier lures Valjean into a trap on the streets with his gang and later attempts to rob him in his house, which is located on Rue Plumet.\n* In Act 2, ''The First Attack'', Valjean shoots a sniper who is attempting to kill Enjolras. It is unclear in the musical (due to the sniper being off stage) whether Valjean actually shoots the sniper or if he shoots the sniper's helmet to prevent him from killing Enjolras. In the novel, he shoots only at soldiers' helmets while at the barricade and purposely does not kill anyone.\n* Valjean reveals his past to Marius before Marius and Cosette's wedding, and he also does not attend it. In the book, he does attend the wedding and confesses to Marius afterwards.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n{{Main|Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\nSince the original publication of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in 1862, the character of Jean Valjean has been in a large number of adaptations in numerous types of media based on the novel, such as [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Books|books]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Film|films]],<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014450 Jean Valjean (Character)] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Musical|musicals]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Plays|plays]] and [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Games|games]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikisource|Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\n*[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014450 Jean Valjean (Character)] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]\n*[http://www.ibdb.com/advSearchRole.php Search for Jean Valjean] at the [[Internet Broadway Database]]\n\n{{lesmis}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Valjean, Jean}}\n[[Category:Les Mis\u00e9rables characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional mayors]]\n[[Category:Fictional outlaws]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people in literature]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1862]]\n[[Category:Fictional people from the 19th-century]]\n[[Category:Fictional thieves]]\n[[Category:Fictional prison escapees]]\n[[Category:Everyman]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the fictional character in Victor Hugo's novel ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' and its various adaptations|the novel by Solomon Cleaver|Jean Val Jean{{!}}''Jean Val Jean''|the asteroid|24601 Valjean}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour           = <!-- headers background colour; the foreground colour is automatically computed -->\n| name             = Jean Valjean\n| series           = [[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]\n| image            = Monsieur Madeleine par Gustave Brion.jpg\n| image_upright    = \n| alt              = \n| caption          = Jean Valjean disguised as Monsieur Madeleine.

The story depicts the character's 19-year-long struggle to lead a normal life after serving a prison sentence for stealing bread to feed his sister's children during a time of [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] and various attempts to escape from prison. Valjean is also known in the novel as '''Monsieur Madeleine''', '''Ultime Fauchelevent''', '''Monsieur Leblanc''', and '''Urbain Fabre.'''\n\nValjean and police Inspector [[Javert]], who repeatedly encounters Valjean and attempts to return him to prison, have become archetypes in literary culture. In the popular imagination, the character of Jean Valjean came to represent Hugo himself.\n\nIn 1871, when Hugo was living in Brussels during the radical revolt known as the [[Paris Commune]],  anti-revolutionary mobs attacked his house and broke windows shouting \"Down with Jean Valjean!\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Behr |first=Edward |title=The Complete Book of Les Mis\u00e9rables|year=1989|publisher=Arcade|location=NY|page=24}}</ref>\n\n== Outline of the novel ==\nAs a [[parolee]], Valjean is issued a yellow passport with marching orders to [[Pontarlier]], where he will be forced to live under severe restrictions. This document, often called a \"passeport jaune\" (yellow passport), identifies him to all as a former convict and immediately brands Valjean an outcast wherever he travels. His life turns around when [[Bishop Myriel]] of [[Digne]], from whom he steals valuable silverware, tells the police that he has given the treasure to Valjean. Out of this encounter, Valjean becomes a [[repentant]], honorable, and dignified man. He becomes kind, a devoted father-figure to a girl who loses her mother, [[Cosette]], and a benefactor to those in need. Although a known criminal and a parolee, Valjean yet grows morally to represent the best traits of humanity. Despite being classified as a criminal outcast, Valjean maintains the highest of human virtues and ethics.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nHis antithesis, [[Javert]], a dedicated and capable police officer, occupies a place of honour in society. The relationship of Javert and Valjean develops as a binary opposition between law and love. Javert sees Valjean only as the convict he once was, rather than the benefactor of humanity he has become. Javert's struggle against this dichotomy leads to his eventual suicide.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n== In the novel ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}\n\n=== Part One: Fantine ===\nAfter devoting the novel's opening chapters to [[Bishop Myriel]], a kind-hearted old clergyman in the town of Digne, Hugo, without any transition, launches into the story of Valjean. He is a strange man, who arrives one October evening in [[Digne]], searches for a place to stay the night and is turned away. At last he is taken in by the bishop, who trusts him, feeds him supper, and gives him a bed for the night. Hugo then details Valjean's background. He was born sometime in 1769 in a small town and orphaned as a child. He became a pruner and helped support his widowed sister and her seven children. In the winter of 1795, when resources were scarce, Valjean stole a loaf of bread from a local baker by breaking the [[window]]. He was caught and imprisoned for five years in the [[Bagne of Toulon]], the Toulon prison. He attempted to escape four times, and each time his sentence was lengthened by three years; he also received an extra two years for once resisting recapture during his second escape. After nineteen years in prison, he was released, but by law must carry a yellow passport that announces he is an ex-convict.\n\nDuring the night, he awakens and steals the bishop's silverware and silver plates, and runs off. He is arrested and brought back to the bishop. However, the Bishop admonishes Valjean (in front of the police) for forgetting to also take the silver candlesticks that he'd given Valjean, reminding Valjean of his \"promise\" to use the silver to become an honest man, claiming to have bought Valjean's soul with it, withdrawing it from evil and giving it to God. Despite the Bishop's words, it is later revealed that the police marked the event down in Valjean's permanent record.\n\nBewildered and not understanding what the bishop is talking about, Jean Valjean heads instead back out into the nearby mountains and meets a young traveling worker from Savoy named [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Petit Gervais]]. Valjean places his foot on a coin that Petit Gervais drops, then refuses to return it, despite Gervais' protests, and threatens to beat him. When the boy flees the scene and Valjean comes to his senses, remembering what the bishop told him, he is ashamed of what he has done and searches for the boy in vain.\n\nHugo introduces [[Fantine]] and explains how she came to be abandoned by her child's father. In late 1815, Jean Valjean, now using the name Madeleine, arrives in [[Montreuil-sur-Mer]]. He revolutionizes the town's manufacturing and earns a fortune, which he spends mostly for the town's good, paying for the maintenance (including required staff) of hospital beds, orphanages and schools. He is appointed mayor after refusing the first time. He declines the king's offer to make him a [[Legion of honor#First Empire|Knight of the Legion of Honor]].\n\nMadeleine (Valjean) saves an old man named [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Fauchelevent]] from death. Fauchelevent had fallen beneath his wagon as his horse fell and broke two of its legs. Madeleine offers to pay anyone who could raise the wagon but nobody wants to risk his life climbing under the wagon. Javert, who witnessed the scene, tells Madeleine that he had only known of one man capable of doing such a feat, and that was a convict doing forced labor in Toulon. Madeleine turns pale, but gets down into the mud and lifts the wagon off Fauchelevent. Since Fauchelevent had earlier lost his business and now had a broken kneecap, Madeleine (Valjean) arranges a job at a convent for Fauchelevent. Valjean also brings the broken cart and horse as an excuse to give Fauchelevent money.\n\nLater, Javert arrests Fantine, who has become a prostitute, when he sees her scratch and try to hit a bourgeois named [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Bamatabois]], who had taunted Fantine and thrown snow down her dress while she walked back and forth trying to get business. Valjean was told what had happened and knew that Bamatabois should have been the one arrested and ordered Fantine free. Javert knew only what he'd seen and was furious with Valjean for interfering with police work. When Valjean orders Javert to leave in front of Javert's squad, Javert leaves and denounces \"Madeleine\" to the prefect of police at Paris, saying that he suspects Madeleine is Valjean. Javert is told that he must be incorrect because the \"real\" Jean Valjean (who is in reality [[Champmathieu]]) had just been found.\n\nValjean takes Fantine to the local hospital (which is on the side of the mayor's house) and has her cared for. He learns of Cosette, Fantine's daughter, and tries to pay off the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]] (who are abusing Cosette).\n\nJavert then apologizes to \"M. Madeleine\", and tells him that the \"real\" Jean Valjean has been found and is to be tried the next day. Javert also asks that he be [[Termination of employment|dismissed]] in disgrace by Valjean from his job for acting out of revenge incorrectly, saying that since he had been hard on others he could not be less harsh on himself but after Valjean repeatedly refuses, Javert says he will continue acting as police chief until a replacement can be found.\n\nIt is only here that the novel finally reveals Madeleine to be Valjean, a fact which was heavily [[foreshadowing|foreshadowed]] before.\n\n[[File:\u00c9mile Bayard - Il lui ferma les yeux.jpg|thumb|left|The death of Fantine; Valjean (as Monsieur Madeleine) closes her eyes.]]\nThat night, Valjean has a terrific struggle within himself, but finally decides to go to the trial and reveal his identity in order to free Champmathieu (for, if he gave himself up, who would care for Fantine or rescue Cosette?). He gives his evidence and proves that he is the real Jean Valjean, but nobody wants to arrest him, so Valjean says that they know where to find him and he returns to Montreuil-sur-Mer. The judge at the trial, although quite impressed with M. Madeleine's work and reputation, is shocked that Valjean, while mentioning a date that another convict had tattooed on himself (in order to prove that M. Madeleine was actually Jean Valjean) called [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]] \"the Emperor\" instead of \"Bonaparte\" and orders Valjean arrested for robbing Petit Gervais. Javert comes to arrest him the next day while Valjean is in Fantine's room. Valjean asks for three days to get Cosette from Montfermeil and give her to Fantine before he is arrested and Javert refuses, saying that it would be too easy for Valjean to escape. Fantine (who'd been told by the doctors that Valjean, who'd been at the trial, had been getting her daughter) was shocked to find that her daughter was not there already and that her savior was being arrested, and died of shock (her body had been greatly weakened by her poor living conditions and long illness, probably [[tuberculosis]]).\n\nValjean allows Javert to arrest him, but quickly escapes. It is hinted that Valjean escaped with the help of a file hidden in a coin, an item he is later proved to possess. Valjean returns to his house to pack his clothes and hides behind the door when Javert comes looking for him. [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Sister Simplice]], one of the hospital nuns, who had a reputation for never having told a lie in her life, twice lied to Javert that there was nobody there but her to protect Valjean. Javert believed her and left, giving Valjean an opportunity to escape the town.\n\n=== Part Two: Cosette ===\n\nA short chapter, mainly consisting of two newspaper articles, informs the reader, that Jean Valjean has been re-arrested while getting into the stagecoach to [[Montfermeil]] (on his way to get Fantine's eight-year-old daughter, [[Cosette]], whom he had promised to rescue). In July 1823, he was condemned to death for the 40-sous theft and the escape from the jail in Montreuil-sur-Mer, as the prosecutor claims that Valjean was part of a gang of street robbers and the latter refuses to defend himself. His sentence was graciously reduced by the king to only life in prison instead of death. Before he was captured, Jean Valjean had already traveled near to Montfermeil and buried all the money he'd saved as M. Madeleine\u2014a chapter tells of a worker in [[Montfermeil]], a former Toulon convict, who claims having seen, according to a local fairy tale, the devil burying his treasure in the forest. No further explanation is ever given as to why, having buried his money near Montfermeil, Valjean had traveled back to Paris and then attempted to travel back to Montfermeil.\n\nValjean was assigned a new number of 9430, but escapes from a sailing vessel after only a few months' imprisonment, on 16 November 1823, by apparently falling into the sea after a daring rescue of a sailor who had gotten stuck in a dangerous situation up in the ship's rigging. Thereafter he is officially presumed dead.\n\nValjean goes to Montfermeil, where he meets Cosette alone in the forest on [[Christmas Eve]], 1823. He accompanies her back to the inn; and watches that evening as the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]] mistreat her very badly. He sees the Th\u00e9nardiers' daughters [[\u00c9ponine]] and [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Azelma]] acting unkindly to her as well, tattling on her to their mother when she tries to play with their temporarily abandoned doll. After seeing this, Valjean briefly leaves the inn and returns with a beautiful new doll to give to Cosette, which she happily accepts. This makes Mme. Th\u00e9nardier furious with Valjean, affronted that he would do such a thing for Cosette instead of her own daughters. M. Th\u00e9nardier tells her that Valjean can do as he wishes as long as he pays them. That evening, Mme. Th\u00e9nardier insists that Cosette will be turned out onto the street the next day.\n\nThe next morning, [[Christmas Day]], Valjean offers to take Cosette with him. Mme. Th\u00e9nardier immediately accepts, but M. Th\u00e9nardier haggles for a compensation and gets 1500 francs in the end. Valjean takes Cosette with him. Only now does the book confirm that the mysterious man Cosette met is actually Jean Valjean. M. Th\u00e9nardier is soon overcome with grief at having sold Cosette too cheaply and runs after them. When M. Th\u00e9nardier demands more money, Valjean gives him the note Fantine signed before she died, saying that the bearer of the note was authorized to take Cosette. M. Th\u00e9nardier tries to continue following Valjean, but is soon frightened back to the inn.\n\nValjean takes Cosette to [[Paris]], where they live in No. 50-52 [[Boulevard de l'H\u00f4pital]], in the so-called \"Gorbeau House.\" They cannot live calmly for long\u2014in Spring 1824, Javert, who has been promoted to the police in Paris, finds the house. He has heard of a \"kidnapping\" from Montfermeil and remembers Valjean's request of three days. He has also heard of a man, poorly dressed, who gives money to other poor people, the \"beggar who gives alms\", who had a granddaughter with him and who has been heard to say that she came from Montfermeil. Javert goes undercover, discovers that it is Jean Valjean, and makes plans to arrest him.\n\nValjean recognizes Javert, and taking Cosette, walks out of the house and leaves. They barely manage to get away from Javert, who allowed Valjean to leave the house, believing that Valjean would take him to meet other criminals. Valjean managed to steal a rope from a streetlamp, climb a wall to a convent and pull Cosette up after him. They then climbed down a shed roof into a garden. it turned out that this was the convent where Fauchelevent worked, who wanted to return the favor and save Valjean's life this time. After almost burying Valjean alive in a scheme to get him out of the convent so that he could openly walk back into the convent, Fauchelevent was able to bring in his \"brother\" Ultimas (fr. Ultime) Fauchelevent (the real name of Fauchelevent's deceased brother). Cosette was admitted to the convent school.\n\n=== Part Three: Marius ===\n\nDuring this whole part, Valjean and Cosette are unnamed, as the action is seen from [[Marius Pontmercy]]'s point of view. They are described only as a father and daughter, whom Marius notices on his daily walks in the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]]. He ignores them at first, but later he and Cosette fall in love. Marius stalks the two until Valjean is alerted that someone is stalking them and moves from his house in Rue de l'Ouest (today [[Rue d'Assas]]).\n\nThey meet again by pure luck, six months later: Valjean is known for his generosity. As \"the generous man from the St-\u00c9tienne-church\", Th\u00e9nardier, Marius' neighbour, asks for charity. He recognises Valjean and decides to build a trap for him. Marius, overhearing the plans, denounces the plot to the police, unfortunately meeting Javert. Valjean walks right into the trap and attempts to escape Th\u00e9nardier once he realises this. Th\u00e9nardier forces Valjean to write a letter to Cosette, instructing her to come with the bearer. Valjean, however, gives Th\u00e9nardier a false name and address and manages to free himself of the ropes tying him with the help of a file concealed in a coin, which is found afterwards. He berates the gang for thinking that they could force him to tell something he does not want to tell and burns his own left forearm with the poker Th\u00e9nardier had used to threaten him before surrendering to the gang. It is at that moment that Javert enters the scene. Valjean manages to escape before the latter recognises him.\n\n=== Part Four: Saint-Denis ===\n\nOnly now is when Valjean's and Cosette's life during the last years revealed: They lived in the convent until Fauchelevent's death, and left in 1829; Cosette is fourteen years old. Valjean buys three houses (so that he will always have somewhere to flee to) in Rue de l'Ouest (today Rue D'Assas), Rue Plumet (today Rue Oudinot) and No. 7 Rue de l'Homme-Arm\u00e9 (today 40, rue des Archives), mostly living in Rue Plumet.\n\nValjean does not know that Cosette returns Marius' love and does not understand why Cosette seems less attached to \"her grandfather\" than before. He is happy to see that the brand wound he got during the attack makes her worry and care for him more. During one of their walks, they witness the passing of a chain gang being taken from Paris south. The event leaves a profound impression on Cosette and makes Valjean even more determined to stop his daughter from learning about his past.\n\nMarius, through \u00c9ponine, finds Cosette, stalks her house, leaves his daily love journal for her to find then one evening leaps over the gate and surprises her in the garden. They begin meeting every evening to gaze into each other's eyes. But it is also \u00c9ponine, jealous, who throws Valjean an anonymous note, telling him to move. Valjean, feeling threatened since the incident with Th\u00e9nardier and since he believes there has been a man hiding in his garden, decides to move to England. He takes Cosette to the house in the Rue de l'Homme-Arm\u00e9. This takes places during the first days of June 1832.\n\nIt is only there that he learns of Cosette's love for Marius when a young boy ([[Gavroche]]) delivers a letter from Marius to Cosette, which mentions that Marius is at the barricade and will die as he promised her, since she left without a forwarding address. Valjean has another long inward struggle, at first feeling relief about Marius' certain death, then guilt about his former feeling. He joins the rebellion without an actual decision about his following actions.\n\n=== Part Five: Valjean ===\n[[File:Lesmiserables 1900 valjean rescues Marius.jpg|thumb|Valjean rescues Marius through the sewers. Illustration by [[Mead Schaeffer]]]]\nValjean plays his part in the insurrection and proves an excellent shot. To thank him, [[Enjolras]], the barricade's leader, offers him anything he wants. Valjean asks that he be allowed to kill Javert, who has been captured as a spy. The request is granted and Valjean takes Javert out of sight to kill him but instead of executing him, sets him free, though Javert warns that he will still be bound to arrest Valjean. Valjean agrees and gives Javert his address. After Valjean releases Javert, the fighters on the barricades are all killed with the exception of Marius, whom Valjean carries to safety through miles of Parisian sewers. Valjean finds the sewer exit to the Grand-Caillou locked. Th\u00e9nardier is there and has the key. He offers Valjean the key in return for payment, believing that Valjean had killed Marius for his money. Valjean gives the few sous he has to Th\u00e9nardier and unlocks the sewer gate and encounters Javert, now returned to duty and in pursuit of Th\u00e9nardier. Valjean requests that Javert help him carry Marius to safety and Javert summons his carriage. Valjean asks permission to return home to say goodbye to Cosette and Javert agrees, saying that he will wait out front. As he walks up the stairs, Valjean looks out the window and notices that Javert is gone. Javert confronts his life spent in pursuit of a criminal who has demonstrated a sense of justice outside of the one that Javert has upheld his entire life. Unable to accept this, he commits suicide.\n\nAfter recovering from his injuries, Marius receives permission from his grandfather to marry Cosette and they wed. The day after the wedding, Valjean reveals to Marius that he is an ex-convict. Marius, horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean's character and begins pushing him out of Cosette's life. After this, Valjean's previously habitual visits to Cosette at Marius' grandfather's house become shorter and shorter, until he ceases to visit at all, having become bedridden with loss of will to live. Some time after he stops coming, Th\u00e9nardier visits Marius and claims that Valjean is a murderer and shows Marius several newspaper articles to prove this. Marius sees through Th\u00e9nardier's disguise and, in an attempt to show Marius something that he does not already know, Th\u00e9nardier shows newspaper clippings proving that M. Madeleine and Jean Valjean are the same person, and that Javert committed suicide. Marius is then told that Valjean was the man who had \"assassinated\" one of Marius' relatives, carrying the body through the sewers on 6 June. Realizing that Th\u00e9nardier had seen Valjean saving him, Marius finishes with Th\u00e9nardier and hurries with Cosette to Valjean's flat. Unfortunately, they are too late and find Valjean is dying. Valjean makes peace with Marius, with whom he had uneasy relations, and tells Cosette the name of her mother, Fantine. He dies content, under the light of the Bishop's candlesticks, and it is stated that an angel awaits to carry his soul to Heaven. He is buried in an unmarked grave, per his request, after death. Only these four lines appear on the gravestone:\n\n<poem>\n''Il dort. Quoique le sort f\u00fbt pour lui bien \u00e9trange,''\n''Il vivait. Il mourut quand il n'eut plus son ange;''\n''La chose simplement d'elle-m\u00eame arriva,''\n''Comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s'en va.''</poem>\n\n<poem>\nTranslation:\nHe sleeps.

The number appears only twice in the novel, and is never spoken by Javert.\n* Valjean's assumed name, Monsieur Madeleine, is used in the original French language [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|concept album]], but not in the later English version of the musical, where he is only called ''Monsieur le maire'' (Mr. Mayor). In the 2012 film adaptation of the musical, the factory foreman breaks up the fight between Fantine and the factory workers, announcing \"Monsieur Madeleine's here!\". The assumed name can also be seen on the door of his office.\n* In the novel, Valjean is arrested for the second time after confessing to be a parole-breaker in court. Javert later chases him for escaping prison. In the musical, Valjean neither gets arrested again nor escapes from prison.\n* Valjean and Cosette do not live in Gorbeau House and take refuge from Javert in a convent in the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|musical version]], but the 2012 movie depicts Valjean inadvertently entering the convent with Cosette while escaping Javert, where he then encounters Fauchelevent. The Gorbeau House episode with the Thenardiers is also omitted in the musical and film adaptation. Instead, Thenardier lures Valjean into a trap on the streets with his gang and later attempts to rob him in his house, which is located on Rue Plumet.\n* In Act 2, ''The First Attack'', Valjean shoots a sniper who is attempting to kill Enjolras. It is unclear in the musical (due to the sniper being off stage) whether Valjean actually shoots the sniper or if he shoots the sniper's helmet to prevent him from killing Enjolras. In the novel, he shoots only at soldiers' helmets while at the barricade and purposely does not kill anyone.\n* Valjean reveals his past to Marius before Marius and Cosette's wedding, and he also does not attend it. In the book, he does attend the wedding and confesses to Marius afterwards.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n{{Main|Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\nSince the original publication of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in 1862, the character of Jean Valjean has been in a large number of adaptations in numerous types of media based on the novel, such as [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Books|books]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Film|films]],<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014450 Jean Valjean (Character)] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Musical|musicals]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Plays|plays]] and [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Games|games]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikisource|Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\n*[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014450 Jean Valjean (Character)] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]\n*[http://www.ibdb.com/advSearchRole.php Search for Jean Valjean] at the [[Internet Broadway Database]]\n\n{{lesmis}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Valjean, Jean}}\n[[Category:Les Mis\u00e9rables characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional mayors]]\n[[Category:Fictional outlaws]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people in literature]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1862]]\n[[Category:Fictional people from the 19th-century]]\n[[Category:Fictional thieves]]\n[[Category:Fictional prison escapees]]\n[[Category:Everyman]]\n", "name_user": "Raladic", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding Colm Wilkinson who was the original cast of Jean Valjean of the English Language Musical", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Valjean"}

CDCR correctional officers are sworn law enforcement officers with peace officer powers.\n\nAs of 2013, CDCR employed approximately 24,000 peace officers (state correctional officers), 1,800 state parole agents, and 200 criminal investigators/special agents.\n\n\n\n'''Secretary Ralph Diaz'''\n\nRalph Diaz was appointed by Governor Gavin Newsom as Secretary for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) on March 27, 2019. Most recently, he served as Undersecretary of Operations, Deputy Director of Facility Operations, and Associate Director of High Security Institutions. Before that, Mr. Diaz served as a prison Warden, Correctional Counselor Supervisor, and Correctional Counselor, after starting his career as a Correctional Officer in 1991. \n\nMr. Diaz has the honor and privilege to lead over 60,000 of the nation\u2019s finest correctional professionals, who provide outstanding levels of rehabilitative services to the offenders in our care. \n\nWith more than 29 years of diverse correctional experience, Mr. Diaz has seen first-hand how restorative justice practices can transform communities inside and outside prison walls. He believes in a holistic approach to corrections that offers a variety of educational, vocational, and therapeutic programs to offenders while also stressing individual accountability and respecting and honoring victims of crime.\n\nMr. Diaz has been instrumental in developing policies focused on staff well-being and professional development, while empowering them to serve as role models and mentors to all.<ref>CDCR Webpage https://cdcr.ca.gov/about-cdcr/secretary.html/ref>\n==History==\nIn 1851, California activated its first state-run institution.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation).

FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates.

Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|}}\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|}}\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

Brown]]'' is a federal [[class action]] [[civil rights]] lawsuit alleging unconstitutionally inadequate medical services, and as a result of a [[stipulation]] between the plaintiffs and the state, the court issued an [[injunction]] requiring defendants to provide \"only the minimum level of medical care required under the Eighth Amendment.\" However, three years after approving the stipulation as an order of the court, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing that revealed the continued existence of appalling conditions arising from defendants\u2019 failure to provide adequate medical care to California inmates.

It grossed $86&nbsp;million worldwide against a production budget of $20&nbsp;million. Two sequels, ''[[John Wick: Chapter 2]]'', and ''[[John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum]]'', were released in February 2017 and May 2019 respectively, both to comparable critical and commercial success, with another sequel, ''John Wick: Chapter 4'', set for a May 2021 release. It is also the only film in the series to be distributed by [[Summit Entertainment]], as the other films are distributed by [[Lionsgate Films]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nAfter John Wick loses his wife Helen to a terminal illness, he receives a [[beagle]] puppy named Daisy from her to help him cope with his grief. Despite John's stoic demeanor, he bonds with the puppy and they spend their day driving around in his vintage 1969 [[Ford Mustang Mach 1]]. At a gas station, he encounters a trio of Russian gangsters whose leader Iosef insists on buying his car, but John repeatedly states that it is not for sale. Frustrated, the mobsters follow John to his home, knock him unconscious, steal his car, and kill Daisy.\n\nIosef takes the Mustang to a [[chop shop]] to have the [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] changed. Aurelio, the shop's owner, recognizes the car and, upon learning that Iosef stole it from John, punches Iosef before kicking him out of his shop. John visits Aurelio, who identifies Iosef as the son of Viggo Tarasov, the head of the [[Russian mafia|Russian crime syndicate]] in [[New York City]]. Viggo, informed by Aurelio of Iosef's activities, beats and berates Iosef before explaining to him who John Wick is: A famed assassin formerly in Viggo's employ, nicknamed \"[[Baba Yaga]]\" (translated in the film as {{Langnf||Russian|\"[[Bogeyman|Boogeyman]]\"}}). Previously, when John wanted to retire and marry Helen, Viggo gave him an \"impossible task\", implied to involve multiple assassinations in a short period of time. John succeeded, and his efforts were key in establishing the Tarasov syndicate.\n\nViggo tries to talk John out of seeking retribution, but John refuses. Viggo then sends a twelve-man hit squad to John's house, but John kills them all and has the bodies professionally removed. An unsurprised Viggo places a $2 million bounty on John's head and personally offers the [[contract killing|contract]] to John's mentor, Marcus, who accepts the offer. John seeks refuge at the Continental Hotel, which caters exclusively to the criminal underworld and permits no assassinations on its premises. Viggo doubles the bounty for those willing to break the rules to kill John at the Continental. Winston, the Continental's owner, tells John that Viggo has Iosef under guard at his nightclub, the Red Circle. John enters the Red Circle and makes his way to Iosef, but Viggo's henchman Kirill waylays John, allowing Iosef to escape.\n\nJohn retreats to the Continental to patch up his injuries. Ms. Perkins, an assassin and former acquaintance, sneaks into John's room to kill him, but Marcus alerts John, allowing him to subdue Perkins. John forces Perkins to reveal the location of Viggo's [[front organization|front]], knocks her unconscious, and leaves her with Harry, a fellow assassin, to await punishment. However, Perkins frees herself and kills Harry. John travels to the [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Little Russia]] church, which serves as Viggo's front, and destroys Viggo's cache of money and [[blackmail]] material. When Viggo and his team arrive, John ambushes them, but is subdued and captured. Viggo taunts John for thinking that he could leave his old life behind. Marcus intervenes again, allowing John to free himself and to kill Kirill before accosting Viggo, who (implied to be tired of his son's behavior) reveals Iosef's location. John then travels to the [[safe house]], killing Iosef and his bodyguards.\n\nPerkins learns that John and Marcus have been in contact and tells Viggo, who has Marcus beaten and tortured before executing him in his home. Viggo calls John to report this, planning to have Perkins ambush him. While waiting for John, Perkins is called to a meeting with Winston, who has her executed for killing Harry on Continental grounds. Winston calls John to inform him that Viggo is planning to escape by helicopter. John races to the harbor helipad, where he kills Viggo's remaining henchmen before engaging Viggo in a battle on the dock. Viggo pulls out a knife, and John allows himself to be stabbed, surprising Viggo. John then disarms Viggo and fatally wounds him. John breaks into a waterfront animal clinic to treat his wound and releases a [[pit bull]] puppy scheduled to be euthanized. John and the dog walk home along the boardwalk, where he had his last date with Helen.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Keanu Reeves]] as [[John Wick (character)|John Wick]]\n:A former hitman who  returns to the underworld he fought to leave behind.<ref name=\"John Wick Review\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/mess-with-keanus-puppy-at-your-peril-in-blazing-97633834091.html|title=Mess With Keanu Reeves' Puppy At Your Peril In Blazing John Wick Trailer|publisher=[[Yahoo]]|accessdate=September 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919232713/https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/mess-with-keanus-puppy-at-your-peril-in-blazing-97633834091.html|archive-date=September 19, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsgatepublicity.com/uploads/assets/JOHN%20WICK%20FINAL%20Production%20Notes.pdf|title=John Wick PRODUCTION NOTES|publisher=[[Lionsgate]]|accessdate=October 22, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129041940/http://www.lionsgatepublicity.com/uploads/assets/JOHN%20WICK%20FINAL%20Production%20Notes.pdf|archive-date=November 29, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> On accepting the role of Wick, Reeves explained, \"Basil and Peter Lawson of Thunder Road brought the script to me with the idea that I would be a part of such a great collaboration.

It grossed $86&nbsp;million worldwide against a production budget of $20&nbsp;million. Two sequels, ''[[John Wick: Chapter 2]]'', and ''[[John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum]]'', were released in February 2017 and May 2019 respectively, both to comparable critical and commercial success, with another sequel, ''John Wick: Chapter 4'', set for a May 2021 release. It is also the only film in the series to be distributed by [[Summit Entertainment]], as the other films are distributed by [[Lionsgate Films]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nAfter John Wick loses his wife Helen to a terminal illness, he receives a [[beagle]] puppy named Daisy from her to help him cope with his grief. Despite John's stoic demeanor, he bonds with the puppy and they spend their day driving around in his vintage 1969 [[Ford Mustang Mach 1]]. At a gas station, he encounters a trio of Russian gangsters whose leader Iosef insists on buying his car, but John repeatedly states that it is not for sale. Frustrated, the mobsters follow John to his home, knock him unconscious, steal his car, and kill Daisy.\n\nIosef takes the Mustang to a [[chop shop]] to have the [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] changed. Aurelio, the shop's owner, recognizes the car and, upon learning that Iosef stole it from John, punches Iosef before kicking him out of his shop. John visits Aurelio, who identifies Iosef as the son of Viggo Tarasov, the head of the [[Russian mafia|Russian crime syndicate]] in [[New York City]]. Viggo, informed by Aurelio of Iosef's activities, beats and berates Iosef before explaining to him who John Wick is: A famed assassin formerly in Viggo's employ, nicknamed \"[[Baba Yaga]]\" (translated in the film as {{Langnf||Russian|\"[[Bogeyman|Boogeyman]]\"}}). Previously, when John wanted to retire and marry Helen, Viggo gave him an \"impossible task\", implied to involve multiple assassinations in a short period of time. John succeeded, and his efforts were key in establishing the Tarasov syndicate.\n\nViggo tries to talk John out of seeking retribution, but John refuses. Viggo then sends a twelve-man hit squad to John's house, but John kills them all and has the bodies professionally removed. An unsurprised Viggo places a $2 million bounty on John's head and personally offers the [[contract killing|contract]] to John's mentor, Marcus, who accepts the offer. John seeks refuge at the Continental Hotel, which caters exclusively to the criminal underworld and permits no assassinations on its premises. Viggo doubles the bounty for those willing to break the rules to kill John at the Continental. Winston, the Continental's owner, tells John that Viggo has Iosef under guard at his nightclub, the Red Circle. John enters the Red Circle and makes his way to Iosef, but Viggo's henchman Kirill waylays John, allowing Iosef to escape.\n\nJohn retreats to the Continental to patch up his injuries. Ms. Perkins, an assassin and former acquaintance, sneaks into John's room to kill him, but Marcus alerts John, allowing him to subdue Perkins. John forces Perkins to reveal the location of Viggo's [[front organization|front]], knocks her unconscious, and leaves her with Harry, a fellow assassin, to await punishment. However, Perkins frees herself and kills Harry. John travels to the [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Little Russia]] church, which serves as Viggo's front, and destroys Viggo's cache of money and [[blackmail]] material. When Viggo and his team arrive, John ambushes them, but is subdued and captured. Viggo taunts John for thinking that he could leave his old life behind. Marcus intervenes again, allowing John to free himself and to kill Kirill before accosting Viggo, who (implied to be tired of his son's behavior) reveals Iosef's location. John then travels to the [[safe house]], killing Iosef and his bodyguards.\n\nPerkins learns that John and Marcus have been in contact and tells Viggo, who has Marcus beaten and tortured before executing him in his home. Viggo calls John to report this, planning to have Perkins ambush him. While waiting for John, Perkins is called to a meeting with Winston, who has her executed for killing Harry on Continental grounds. Winston calls John to inform him that Viggo is planning to escape by helicopter. John races to the harbor helipad, where he kills Viggo's remaining henchmen before engaging Viggo in a battle on the dock.

They adapted the scientific research of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Isaac Newton]] into a form accessible to laypeople.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\">Herbert, Robert L., ''Neo-impressionism'', New York, Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, 1968</ref> Artists followed new discoveries in perception with great interest.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nChevreul was perhaps the most important influence on artists at the time; his great contribution was producing a color wheel of primary and intermediary hues. Chevreul was a French [[chemistry|chemist]] who restored [[tapestry|tapestries]]. During his restorations he noticed that the only way to restore a section properly was to take into account the influence of the colors around the missing [[wool]]; he could not produce the right hue unless he recognized the surrounding [[dye]]s. Chevreul discovered that two colors juxtaposed, slightly overlapping or very close together, would have the effect of another color when seen from a distance. The discovery of this phenomenon became the basis for the pointillist technique of the Neoimpressionist painters.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nChevreul also realized that the \"halo\" that one sees after looking at a color is the opposing color (also known as [[complementary color]]). For example: After looking at a red object, one may see a cyan echo/halo of the original object. This complementary color (as an example, cyan for red) is due to [[retina]]l persistence. Neoimpressionist painters interested in the interplay of colors made extensive use of complementary colors in their paintings. In his works, Chevreul advised artists to think and paint not just the color of the central object, but to add colors and make appropriate adjustments to achieve a harmony among colors. It seems that the harmony Chevreul wrote about is what Seurat came to call \"emotion\".<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nIt is not clear whether Seurat read all of Chevreul's book on color contrast, published in 1859, but he did copy out several paragraphs from the chapter on painting, and he had read [[Charles Blanc]]'s ''Grammaire des arts du dessin'' (1867),<ref name=techbull/> which cites Chevreul's work. Blanc's book was directed at artists and art connoisseurs. Because of color's emotional significance to him, he made explicit recommendations that were close to the theories later adopted by the Neoimpressionists. He said that color should not be based on the \"judgment of taste\", but rather it should be close to what we experience in reality. Blanc did not want artists to use equal intensities of color, but to consciously plan and understand the role of each hue in creating a whole.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nWhile Chevreul based his theories on Newton's thoughts on the mixing of light, Ogden Rood based his writings on the work of Helmholtz. He analyzed the effects of mixing and juxtaposing material pigments. Rood valued as [[primary colors]] red, green, and blue-violet. Like Chevreul, he said that if two colors are placed next to each other, from a distance they look like a third distinctive color. He also pointed out that the juxtaposition of primary hues next to each other would create a far more intense and pleasing color, when perceived by the eye and mind, than the corresponding color made simply by mixing paint. Rood advised artists to be aware of the difference between additive and subtractive qualities of color, since material pigments and optical pigments (light) do not mix in the same way:\n\n*Material pigments: Red + Yellow + Blue = Black\n*Optical / Light : Red + Green + Blue = White\n\nSeurat was also influenced by Sutter's ''Phenomena of Vision'' (1880), in which he wrote that \"the laws of harmony can be learned as one learns the laws of harmony and music\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Sam|last=Hunter|author-link=Sam Hunter|chapter=Georges Seurat|title=Modern Art |url=https://archive.org/details/modernartpaintin00hunt|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|Harry N.

There remains controversy over the extent to which Henry's ideas were adopted by Seurat.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\n===Language of color===\n[[File:Georges Seurat 019.jpg|thumb|''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|The Circus]]'', 1891, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris]]\nSeurat took to heart the color theorists' notion of a scientific approach to painting. He believed that a painter could use color to create harmony and emotion in art in the same way that a musician uses [[counterpoint]] and variation to create harmony in music. He theorized that the scientific application of color was like any other natural law, and he was driven to prove this conjecture. He thought that the knowledge of perception and optical laws could be used to create a new language of art based on its own set of [[heuristic]]s and he set out to show this language using lines, color intensity and color schema. Seurat called this language [[Chromoluminarism]].<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nIn a letter to the writer Maurice Beaubourg in 1890 he wrote: \"Art is Harmony. Harmony is the analogy of the contrary and of similar elements of tone, of colour and of line. In tone, lighter against darker. In colour, the complementary, red-green, orange-blue, yellow-violet. In line, those that form a right-angle.

Calm is achieved through an equivalence/balance of the use of the light and the dark, by the balance of warm and cold colors, and by lines that are horizontal.

They adapted the scientific research of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Isaac Newton]] into a form accessible to laypeople.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\">Herbert, Robert L., ''Neo-impressionism'', New York, Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, 1968</ref> Artists followed new discoveries in perception with great interest.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nChevreul was perhaps the most important influence on artists at the time; his great contribution was producing a color wheel of primary and intermediary hues. Chevreul was a French [[chemistry|chemist]] who restored [[tapestry|tapestries]]. During his restorations he noticed that the only way to restore a section properly was to take into account the influence of the colors around the missing [[wool]]; he could not produce the right hue unless he recognized the surrounding [[dye]]s. Chevreul discovered that two colors juxtaposed, slightly overlapping or very close together, would have the effect of another color when seen from a distance. The discovery of this phenomenon became the basis for the pointillist technique of the Neoimpressionist painters.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nChevreul also realized that the \"halo\" that one sees after looking at a color is the opposing color (also known as [[complementary color]]). For example: After looking at a red object, one may see a cyan echo/halo of the original object. This complementary color (as an example, cyan for red) is due to [[retina]]l persistence. Neoimpressionist painters interested in the interplay of colors made extensive use of complementary colors in their paintings. In his works, Chevreul advised artists to think and paint not just the color of the central object, but to add colors and make appropriate adjustments to achieve a harmony among colors. It seems that the harmony Chevreul wrote about is what Seurat came to call \"emotion\".<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nIt is not clear whether Seurat read all of Chevreul's book on color contrast, published in 1859, but he did copy out several paragraphs from the chapter on painting, and he had read [[Charles Blanc]]'s ''Grammaire des arts du dessin'' (1867),<ref name=techbull/> which cites Chevreul's work. Blanc's book was directed at artists and art connoisseurs. Because of color's emotional significance to him, he made explicit recommendations that were close to the theories later adopted by the Neoimpressionists. He said that color should not be based on the \"judgment of taste\", but rather it should be close to what we experience in reality. Blanc did not want artists to use equal intensities of color, but to consciously plan and understand the role of each hue in creating a whole.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nWhile Chevreul based his theories on Newton's thoughts on the mixing of light, Ogden Rood based his writings on the work of Helmholtz. He analyzed the effects of mixing and juxtaposing material pigments. Rood valued as [[primary colors]] red, green, and blue-violet. Like Chevreul, he said that if two colors are placed next to each other, from a distance they look like a third distinctive color. He also pointed out that the juxtaposition of primary hues next to each other would create a far more intense and pleasing color, when perceived by the eye and mind, than the corresponding color made simply by mixing paint. Rood advised artists to be aware of the difference between additive and subtractive qualities of color, since material pigments and optical pigments (light) do not mix in the same way:\n\n*Material pigments: Red + Yellow + Blue = Black\n*Optical / Light : Red + Green + Blue = White\n\nSeurat was also influenced by Sutter's ''Phenomena of Vision'' (1880), in which he wrote that \"the laws of harmony can be learned as one learns the laws of harmony and music\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Sam|last=Hunter|author-link=Sam Hunter|chapter=Georges Seurat|title=Modern Art |url=https://archive.org/details/modernartpaintin00hunt|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|Harry N. Abrams]] |year=1992|page=[https://archive.org/details/modernartpaintin00hunt/page/27 27]}}</ref> He heard lectures in the 1880s by the mathematician [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], who discussed the [[emotion]]al properties and symbolic meaning of lines and color. There remains controversy over the extent to which Henry's ideas were adopted by Seurat.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\n===Language of color===\n[[File:Georges Seurat 019.jpg|thumb|''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|The Circus]]'', 1891, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris]]\nSeurat took to heart the color theorists' notion of a scientific approach to painting. He believed that a painter could use color to create harmony and emotion in art in the same way that a musician uses [[counterpoint]] and variation to create harmony in music. He theorized that the scientific application of color was like any other natural law, and he was driven to prove this conjecture. He thought that the knowledge of perception and optical laws could be used to create a new language of art based on its own set of [[heuristic]]s and he set out to show this language using lines, color intensity and color schema. Seurat called this language [[Chromoluminarism]].<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nIn a letter to the writer Maurice Beaubourg in 1890 he wrote: \"Art is Harmony. Harmony is the analogy of the contrary and of similar elements of tone, of colour and of line. In tone, lighter against darker. In colour, the complementary, red-green, orange-blue, yellow-violet. In line, those that form a right-angle. The frame is in a harmony that opposes those of the tones, colours and lines of the picture, these aspects are considered according to their dominance and under the influence of light, in gay, calm or sad combinations\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=069rL6vA1BAC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&source=web&ots=j2yei95_hn&sig=l8xStuMceDzHyxwN7FosvRR3Ofg#PPA13,M1 |title='&#39;Art of the 20th Century'&#39;, Karl Ruhrberg |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref><ref>Letter to the writer Maurice Beaubourg, 28 August 1890, ''Seurat'' Phaidon Press, London, 1965</ref>\n\nSeurat's theories can be summarized as follows: The emotion of gaiety can be achieved by the domination of luminous hues, by the predominance of warm colors, and by the use of lines directed upward. Calm is achieved through an equivalence/balance of the use of the light and the dark, by the balance of warm and cold colors, and by lines that are horizontal. Sadness is achieved by using dark and cold colors and by lines pointing downward.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Georges Seurat 066.jpg|thumb|upright=1.28|''[[Parade de cirque|Circus Sideshow (Parade de Cirque)]]'', 1887\u201388, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]\nWhere the dialectic nature of [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]'s work had been greatly influential during the highly expressionistic phase of [[proto-Cubism]], between 1908 and 1910, the work of Seurat, with its flatter, more linear structures, would capture the attention of the [[Cubism|Cubists]] from 1911.<ref name=\"Mittelmann\">[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com/ Alex Mittelmann, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]</ref> Seurat in his few years of activity, was able, with his observations on irradiation and the effects of contrast, to create afresh without any guiding tradition, to complete an esthetic system with a new technical method perfectly adapted to its expression.<ref>[[Roger Fry|Fry, Roger]] Essay in [[The Dial]], Camden, New Jersey, September 1926.</ref>\n\n\"With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910\u20131911,\" writes art historian Robert Herbert, \"questions of form displaced color in the artists' attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant.

''[[Le Chahut|The Chahut]]'' [Rijksmuseum Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller, Otterlo] was called by Andr\u00e9 Salmon 'one of the great icons of the new devotion', and both it and the ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Cirque (Circus)]]'', Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris, according to [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], 'almost belong to Synthetic Cubism'.\"<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nThe concept was well established among the French artists that painting could be expressed mathematically, in terms of both color and form; and this mathematical expression resulted in an independent and compelling \"objective truth\", perhaps more so than the objective truth of the object represented.<ref name=\"Mittelmann\" />\n\nIndeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis in the domain of color (Seurat addresses both problems in ''Circus'' and ''Dancers'').

Reshef's practice is characterised by a \"Control and Release\" technique, in which she pours diluted paint on a horizontal canvas, tilting it and imprinting on it to create layered gestural compositions.<ref>[https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/1d9ca3_53bb3947e27048c985f6c1975fe6b97a.pdf (Control | Release) Catalogue text by Stephen Main (Imprints)]</ref><ref>[https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/1d9ca3_8beeb58afa8c44e5b41a87b89d1b0ea0.pdf (Control | Release) Catalogue text by Sagi Refael (Control | Release)]</ref>\n\nReshef's imprinting technique also follows a process similar to \u201ccameraless photography\u201d, commonly known as [[photogram]]ing, but with painterly materials instead of the chemicals and light sensitive papers used in that technique.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Bodies of work and exhibitions==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nSince 2016 Reshef has been exhibiting different forms of painting-[[Installation art|installation]], in which unstretched scrolls of paintings create a three-dimensional, overlapping experience for the viewing audience. Her most recent painting-installation is '''\u201cArcadia\u201d''',that debuted as a solo exhibition at the [[Katonah Museum of Art]], [[Katonah, New York]], in October 2019. Alluding to [[Nicolas Poussin|Nicholas Poussin]]\u2019s painting [[Et in Arcadia ego|\u201cEt In Arcadia Ego\u201d]], the installation deals with the tension between the picturesque landscape and environment of the museum\u2019s natural surroundings, and with the potential of disturbance and the suspended aggression that lies underneath the surface, both in American and in Israeli societies.\n\nReshef\u2019s first Installation '''\u201cControl l Release\u201d''' was exhibited in ArtSpace TLV gallery, presenting about 44 meters (142 feet) of painting scrolls, hung from the ceiling to the floor, and surrounding the gallery. The exhibition was accompanied with a two-part catalogue, '''\"Control l Release\"''' and '''\"Imprints\"''', with texts by the New York-based critic and artist, Stephen Maine, and by the Los Angeles-based curator, Sagi Refael.\n\nIn 2017 Reshef had installed her large-scale piece '''\u201cTime Traveler\u201d''' in a solo exhibition at the Tall Wall Space in the [[University of La Verne]], California, following an invitation from Dion Johnson, curator of the University of La Verne art galleries. The process of installing that piece on site was documented by photographer and videographer [[Eric Minh Swenson]].\n\n'''\"Time Traveler\"''' was created with six scrolls of paintings interwoven horizontally and vertically into a beautiful, color-blended monumental grid. The entire installation symbolized the four seasons as a visual loop of the passage of time, with each season interlacing to form one cohesive tapestry. The canvases depict varied techniques, color schemes and atmospheres, reflecting of the era we live in, flooded by images in a non-linear way from all directions. The six scroll paintings are merged together in a collision of simultaneous climates, alluding to appearances of global warming phenomenon as rain and storms in the summer, and heat waves in the winter.\n\nDue to the modular and site-specific nature of '''\u201cTime Traveler\u201d''', its second iteration was installed in a new configuration. Following the invite by Rachel T. Schmid, Curator of Collections and Exhibitions at the Kwan Fong Art Gallery in the [[California Lutheran University]], Reshef had installed '''\u201cTime Traveler: Part ll - Compass\u201d''', as a more politically charged version of the original artwork. By titling it \"Compass\", Reshef suggested a conceptual, artistic lighthouse, directing the viewers to inner introspection, at a time of lack of political and social leaders that can direct their countries and communities onto safe grounds. In this polemic era, the monumentality of the piece offered a sanctuary of silent observation and infinite interpretations to the viewers, suggesting that they follow their own path and inner feelings, and not necessarily what politicians want them to do.\n\nIn the summer of 2018 Reshef presented two new bodies of work, the outdoor installation '''\u201cIntervals\u201d''', on the facade of the Zaritsky Artists\u2019 House in Tel Aviv, and '''\u201cSpectrum\u201d''', at the Soho House in West Hollywood, California.\n\n'''\u201cSpectrum\u201d''' manifested Reshef's interest in the process of art making, and in the different ways to depict the elusive nature of the passage of time and of the fleeting seasons. The 22 paintings in this series, presented monochromatic stages inspired by the different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, stressing the existing yet invisible rays of light known to science. On the shorter end of the spectrum is the ultraviolet waves of radiation, while on the longer end of the spectrum is the infrared wave of light. These both ends also mark the shifting tonalities and full range of hues between warm colors of reds and yellows, to cold colors of blues and purples, also sensualizing a change of moods and atmospheres, from somber to cheerful, from coolness to passion.\n\nBetween the years 2018-2019, Reshef had exhibited three site-specific outdoor murals on the facade of the Zaritsky Artists\u05f3 House in Tel Aviv. The first mural, '''\u201cIntervals\u201d''' (2018), presented a faux architectural facade with twenty \u201cwindows\u201d revealing bold, abstract monochrome paintings. Embodying tonal transitions from the scale of warm to cool colors, these works effectively highlighted a hierarchy of atmospheres in the passage of the seasons through the shades, temperatures and emotional qualities affected by shortening and lengthening cycles of hours and days over the course of a year. Displaying Intervals on the wall of the Artists House comprised the completion of a circle and a gesture to the values of abstract painting represented in early Israeli art by [[Joseph Zaritsky]], for whom this venue is named, and a homage to the movement he cofounded, [[Ofakim Hadashim|\"Ofakim Hadashim\" (\u201cNew Horizons\u201d)]].\n\nReshef\u2019s second mural project at the Artists\u2019 House , '''\u201cEden in Two Acts\u201d''' (2019), was divided into two parts, and was specifically produced to react to the second round of elections in Israel in September 2019.\n\nThe first part of the mural was launched in August 2018, prior to the elections and in order to raise awareness to the importance of voting. The second part of the mural was launched on November 2019, and reacted to the elections\u2019 results. Both \u201cacts\u201d of the project featured different abstract paintings, that alluded to the theme of \u201cLost Paradise\u201d, and to the tension between to harmonious potential of living in peace in the middle east, and specifically in Israel, and was Reshef\u2019s most directly political body of work to date.\n\nAlongside Reshef's immersive painting installations, she continued developing her \u201cimprinting\u201d paintings, resulting with her \u201cGhost Libraries\u201d and \u201cFossil\u201d series of 2017-2018, and \u201cHabitat\u201d of 2019.\n\nEarlier bodies of work present Reshef's technique of painting without brushes, after developing her tilting method of paint use (later titled \u201cControl and Release\u201d) in 2010.\n\n== Personal life ==\nReshef is married to businessperson and academic administrator [[Shai Reshef]]. He is the founder and president of the [[University of the People]].

Nearly ten years later, at the request of Modigliani's brother, Emanuele, the H\u00e9buterne family agreed to have her remains transferred to [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] to rest beside Modigliani.\n\nHer [[epitaph]] reads: \"Devoted companion to the extreme sacrifice.\"<ref name=\"Missing\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:MorteJeanne.jpg|thumb|right|''Death'', 1919, by Jeanne H\u00e9buterne]]\n\nTheir orphaned daughter, [[Jeanne Modigliani]] (1918\u20131984), was adopted by her father's sister in [[Florence, Italy]].
