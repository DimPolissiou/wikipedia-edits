It is the lead track on their third studio album, ''[[Urban Hymns]]'' (1997). It is based on a sample it uses from the [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] orchestral cover of [[the Rolling Stones]]' song \"[[The Last Time (The Rolling Stones song)|The Last Time]]\", and involved some legal controversy surrounding a [[plagiarism]] charge. As a result, [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]] were added to the songwriting credits, and all royalties from the song went to former Rolling Stones manager [[Allen Klein]]. In April 2019, Jagger and Richards signed over all their publishing for the song to The Verve.<ref name=\"Dispute over\"/> \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" was released in June 1997 by [[Hut Recordings]] as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from the album, reaching number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and stayed in the chart for three months.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/330634.stm \"The Verve's bitter sweet career\"].

I think Richard had actually cut a version with [[John Leckie]] but, by the time I came on board, he didn't want to do the song. I persuaded him to have a go at cutting a version but at first he wasn't really into it. It was only once we'd put strings on it that he started getting excited. Then, towards the end, Richard wanted to chuck all the album away and start again. What was my reaction? Horror. Sheer horror.
