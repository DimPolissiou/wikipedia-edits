The inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the Moon approximately 3.7&nbsp;billion years ago.\n\nThis concentration is comparable with that of magma in Earth's [[upper mantle]]. While of considerable selenological interest, this announcement affords little comfort to would-be lunar colonists. The sample originated many kilometers below the surface, and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to detect them with a state-of-the-art ion microprobe instrument.\n\n==Possible water cycle==\n\n===Production===\nLunar water has two potential origins: water-bearing [[comet]]s (and other bodies) striking the Moon, and ''in&nbsp;situ'' production. It has been theorized that the latter may occur when hydrogen ions ([[protons]]) in the [[solar wind]] chemically combine with the [[oxygen]] atoms present in the lunar minerals ([[oxide]]s, [[silicate]]s etc.) to produce small amounts of water trapped in the minerals' crystal lattices or as [[hydroxyl]] groups, potential water precursors.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Lunar Hydrogen Distribution after KAGUYA(SELANE)|journal=2009 Annual Meeting of LEG (2009)|author=L.F.A.

The mass balance of a chemical rearrangement supposed at the oxide surface could be schematically written as follows:\n\n:<big>2 X\u2013OH\u2003\u2192\u2003X=O + X + H<sub>2</sub>O</big>\nor, <br />\n:<big>2 X\u2013OH\u2003\u2192\u2003X\u2013O\u2013X + H<sub>2</sub>O</big>\n<br />\nwhere \"X\" represents the oxide surface.\n\nThe formation of one water molecule requires the presence of two adjacent hydroxyl groups, or a cascade of successive reactions of one oxygen atom with two protons. This could constitute a limiting factor and decreases the probability of water production, if the proton density per surface unit is too low.\n\n===Trapping===\n[[Solar radiation]] would normally strip any free water or water ice from the lunar surface, splitting it into its constituent elements, [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], which then escape to space. However, because of the only very slight axial tilt of the Moon's spin axis to the [[Ecliptic|ecliptic plane]] (1.5&nbsp;\u00b0), some deep craters near the poles never receive any sunlight, and are permanently shadowed (see, for example, [[Shackleton (crater)|Shackleton crater]], and [[Whipple (crater)|Whipple crater]]). The temperature in these regions never rises above about 100&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] (about \u2212170&nbsp;\u00b0&nbsp;Celsius),<ref>[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/ice/ice_moon.html Ice on the Moon], NASA</ref> and any water that eventually ended up in these craters could remain frozen and stable for extremely long periods of time \u2014 perhaps billions of years, depending on the stability of the orientation of the Moon's axis.<ref name=\"sciam 9-Jul-08\"/><ref name=Clementine />\n\nWhile the ice deposits may be thick, they are most likely mixed with the regolith, possibly in a layered formation.<ref>[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/moon-mercury-ice The Moon and Mercury May Have Thick Ice Deposits.] Bill Steigerwald and Nancy Jones, NASA. 2 August 2019.</ref>\n\n===Transport===\nAlthough free water cannot persist in illuminated regions of the Moon, any such water produced there by the action of the solar wind on lunar minerals might, through a process of evaporation and condensation<!--Caution such an assertion is still dubious and unproved-->, migrate to permanently cold polar areas and accumulate there as ice, perhaps in addition to any ice brought by comet impacts.<ref name=\"space.com\"/>\n\nThe hypothetical mechanism of water transport / trapping (if any) remains unknown: indeed lunar surfaces directly exposed to the solar wind where water production occurs are too hot to allow trapping by water condensation (and solar radiation also continuously decomposes water), while no (or much less) water production is expected in the cold areas not directly exposed to the Sun. Given the expected short lifetime of water molecules in illuminated regions, a short transport distance would in principle increase the probability of trapping. In other words, water molecules produced close to a cold, dark polar crater should have the highest probability of surviving and being trapped.\n\nTo what extent, and at what spatial scale, direct proton exchange (protolysis) and proton [[surface diffusion]] directly occurring at the naked surface of [[wikt:oxyhydroxide|oxyhydroxide]] minerals exposed to space vacuum (see [[surface diffusion]] and [[self-ionization of water]]) could also play a role in the mechanism of the water transfer towards the coldest point is presently unknown and remains a conjecture.\n\n==Uses==\nThe presence of large quantities of water on the Moon would be an important factor in rendering [[lunar habitation]] cost-effective since transporting water (or hydrogen and oxygen) from Earth would be prohibitively expensive. If future investigations find the quantities to be particularly large, water ice could be mined to provide liquid water for drinking and plant propagation, and the water could also be split into hydrogen and oxygen by solar panel-equipped electric power stations or a nuclear generator, providing breathable oxygen as well as the components of rocket fuel. The hydrogen component of the water ice could also be used to draw out the [[oxides]] in the lunar soil and harvest even more oxygen.\n\nAnalysis of lunar ice would also provide scientific information about the impact history of the Moon and the abundance of comets and asteroids in the early [[Inner Solar System]].\n\n==Ownership==\nThe hypothetical discovery of usable quantities of water on the Moon may raise legal questions about who owns the water and who has the right to exploit it. The United Nations [[Outer Space Treaty]] does not prevent the exploitation of lunar resources, but does prevent the appropriation of the Moon by individual nations and is generally interpreted as barring countries from claiming ownership of [[in-situ]] resources.<ref>[http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/outerspt.html Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (\"Outer Space Treaty\")] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5whITsteH?url=http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/outerspt.html |date=2011-02-22 }}, UN Office for Outer Space Affairs</ref><ref>[http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060306_lunar_ice.html \"Moon Water: A Trickle of Data and a Flood of Questions\"], space.com, March 6, 2006</ref> However most legal experts agree that the ultimate test of the question will arise through precedents of national or private activity.

The inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the Moon approximately 3.7&nbsp;billion years ago.\n\nThis concentration is comparable with that of magma in Earth's [[upper mantle]]. While of considerable selenological interest, this announcement affords little comfort to would-be lunar colonists. The sample originated many kilometers below the surface, and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to detect them with a state-of-the-art ion microprobe instrument.\n\n==Possible water cycle==\n\n===Production===\nLunar water has two potential origins: water-bearing [[comet]]s (and other bodies) striking the Moon, and ''in&nbsp;situ'' production. It has been theorized that the latter may occur when hydrogen ions ([[protons]]) in the [[solar wind]] chemically combine with the [[oxygen]] atoms present in the lunar minerals ([[oxide]]s, [[silicate]]s etc.) to produce small amounts of water trapped in the minerals' crystal lattices or as [[hydroxyl]] groups, potential water precursors.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Lunar Hydrogen Distribution after KAGUYA(SELANE)|journal=2009 Annual Meeting of LEG (2009)|author=L.F.A.

The mass balance of a chemical rearrangement supposed at the oxide surface could be schematically written as follows:\n\n:<big>2 X\u2013OH\u2003\u2192\u2003X=O + X + H<sub>2</sub>O</big>\nor, <br />\n:<big>2 X\u2013OH\u2003\u2192\u2003X\u2013O\u2013X + H<sub>2</sub>O</big>\n<br />\nwhere \"X\" represents the oxide surface.\n\nThe formation of one water molecule requires the presence of two adjacent hydroxyl groups, or a cascade of successive reactions of one oxygen atom with two protons. This could constitute a limiting factor and decreases the probability of water production, if the proton density per surface unit is too low.\n\n===Trapping===\n[[Solar radiation]] would normally strip any free water or water ice from the lunar surface, splitting it into its constituent elements, [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], which then escape to space. However, because of the only very slight axial tilt of the Moon's spin axis to the [[Ecliptic|ecliptic plane]] (1.5&nbsp;\u00b0), some deep craters near the poles never receive any sunlight, and are permanently shadowed (see, for example, [[Shackleton (crater)|Shackleton crater]], and [[Whipple (crater)|Whipple crater]]). The temperature in these regions never rises above about 100&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] (about \u2212170&nbsp;\u00b0&nbsp;Celsius),<ref>[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/ice/ice_moon.html Ice on the Moon], NASA</ref> and any water that eventually ended up in these craters could remain frozen and stable for extremely long periods of time \u2014 perhaps billions of years, depending on the stability of the orientation of the Moon's axis.<ref name=\"sciam 9-Jul-08\"/><ref name=Clementine />\n\nWhile the ice deposits may be thick, they are most likely mixed with the regolith, possibly in a layered formation.<ref>[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/moon-mercury-ice The Moon and Mercury May Have Thick Ice Deposits.] Bill Steigerwald and Nancy Jones, NASA. 2 August 2019.</ref>\n\n===Transport===\nAlthough free water cannot persist in illuminated regions of the Moon, any such water produced there by the action of the solar wind on lunar minerals might, through a process of evaporation and condensation<!--Caution such an assertion is still dubious and unproved-->, migrate to permanently cold polar areas and accumulate there as ice, perhaps in addition to any ice brought by comet impacts.<ref name=\"space.com\"/>\n\nThe hypothetical mechanism of water transport / trapping (if any) remains unknown: indeed lunar surfaces directly exposed to the solar wind where water production occurs are too hot to allow trapping by water condensation (and solar radiation also continuously decomposes water), while no (or much less) water production is expected in the cold areas not directly exposed to the Sun. Given the expected short lifetime of water molecules in illuminated regions, a short transport distance would in principle increase the probability of trapping. In other words, water molecules produced close to a cold, dark polar crater should have the highest probability of surviving and being trapped.\n\nTo what extent, and at what spatial scale, direct proton exchange (protolysis) and proton [[surface diffusion]] directly occurring at the naked surface of [[wikt:oxyhydroxide|oxyhydroxide]] minerals exposed to space vacuum (see [[surface diffusion]] and [[self-ionization of water]]) could also play a role in the mechanism of the water transfer towards the coldest point is presently unknown and remains a conjecture.\n\n==Uses==\nThe presence of large quantities of water on the Moon would be an important factor in rendering [[lunar habitation]] cost-effective since transporting water (or hydrogen and oxygen) from Earth would be prohibitively expensive. If future investigations find the quantities to be particularly large, water ice could be mined to provide liquid water for drinking and plant propagation, and the water could also be split into hydrogen and oxygen by solar panel-equipped electric power stations or a nuclear generator, providing breathable oxygen as well as the components of rocket fuel. The hydrogen component of the water ice could also be used to draw out the [[oxides]] in the lunar soil and harvest even more oxygen.\n\nAnalysis of lunar ice would also provide scientific information about the impact history of the Moon and the abundance of comets and asteroids in the early [[Inner Solar System]].\n\n==Ownership==\nThe hypothetical discovery of usable quantities of water on the Moon may raise legal questions about who owns the water and who has the right to exploit it. The United Nations [[Outer Space Treaty]] does not prevent the exploitation of lunar resources, but does prevent the appropriation of the Moon by individual nations and is generally interpreted as barring countries from claiming ownership of [[in-situ]] resources.<ref>[http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/outerspt.html Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (\"Outer Space Treaty\")] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5whITsteH?url=http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/outerspt.html |date=2011-02-22 }}, UN Office for Outer Space Affairs</ref><ref>[http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060306_lunar_ice.html \"Moon Water: A Trickle of Data and a Flood of Questions\"], space.com, March 6, 2006</ref> However most legal experts agree that the ultimate test of the question will arise through precedents of national or private activity. Some private companies such as [[Shackleton Energy Company]] are already asserting their right to own whatever resources they remove and/or benefit from the Moon or asteroids through their own effort, risk and investment. The [[Moon Treaty]] specifically stipulates that exploitation of lunar resources is to be governed by an \"international regime\", but this treaty has been ratified by only a few of the major space-faring nations.<ref>[http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/gares/html/gares_34_0068.html Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (\"Moon Treaty\")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514053326/http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/gares/html/gares_34_0068.html |date=2008-05-14 }}, UN Office for Outer Space Affairs</ref>\n\n== Tribute ==\nOn 13 November 2009, the discovery of water on the Moon was celebrated with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/discovery-of-water-on-the-moon|title=Discovery of Water on the Moon|date=2009-11-13|website=Google|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n* [[In situ resource utilization]]\n* [[Lunar resources]]\n* [[Shackleton Energy Company]]\n* [[Water on Mars]]\n;Missions mapping lunar water\n* [[Chandrayaan-1]] lunar orbiter\n* [[Chandrayaan-2]] lunar orbiter and rover\n* [[Lunar Flashlight]] solar sail orbiter\n* [[Lunar IceCube]] lunar orbiter\n* [[LunaH-Map]] lunar obiter\n* [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/ice/ice_moon.html Ice on the Moon] \u2014 NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n* [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/281/5382/1496 Fluxes of fast and epithermal neutrons from Lunar Prospector: Evidence for water ice at the lunar poles] \u2014 Science\n* [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/space/article6847457.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&attr=797093 Moon has a litre of water for every tonne of soil] \u2014 Times Online\n* [http://science.slashdot.org/story/09/09/24/0212221/Unambiguous-Evidence-of-Water-On-the-Moon Unambiguous evidence of water on the Moon] \u2014 Slashdot Science Story\n* [http://spie.org/newsroom/technical-articles/6241-cubesat-for-investigating-ice-on-the-moon?highlight=x2418&ArticleID=x117007 CubeSat for investigating ice on the Moon] \u2014 SPIE Newsroom\n\n{{The Moon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lunar Water}}\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Exploration of the Moon|Water]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial water|Moon]]\n[[Category:Lunar science|Water]]\n", "name_user": "68.228.113.4", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(i made it better)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_water"}

He broke into the league during the [[Original Six]] with the Detroit Red Wings, where he competed as the starting goalie with [[Roger Crozier]] in 1964, seeing action in two games. Wetzel was one of only two Americans on an NHL roster during this season, and was the only American goaltender. The other American on an NHL roster for the '64-'65 season was [[Tom Williams (ice hockey, born 1940)|Tommy Williams]], a right winger for the Boston Bruins.\n\nIn 1958, as a 20-year-old, Wetzel played in relief of [[John Henderson (ice hockey)|John Henderson]] for the [[Whitby Dunlops]] against the Soviet national ice hockey team at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]]. This was the first time the Russians played in Canada, and Wetzel backstopped the Dunlops to a 7-2 victory. The Dunlops of 1958 featured [[Harry Sinden]], [[Charlie Burns]], and [[Sid Smith (ice hockey)|Sid Smith]]. At the time, Carl was the goalie for the [[Hamilton Tiger Cubs]] of the [[Ontario Hockey Association|OHA]] and played against the Dunlops prior to the game against the Russians. Whitby\u2019s coach, [[Wren Blair]], took note of Carl\u2019s play, and upon a knee injury suffered by Whitby goaltender John Henderson, coach Blair called upon the young American to represent Canada against the Russians. It was during this 1958 season with the Tiger Cubs that Carl also played in the OHA all-star game against [[Denis DeJordy]], [[Chico Maki]], [[Matt Ravlich]], [[Pat Stapleton (ice hockey)|Pat Stapleton]], and [[John McKenzie (ice hockey)|John McKenzie]].\n\nHowever, Carl Wetzel is probably best known for starring for the United States ice hockey national team at the 1967 [[Ice Hockey World Championship]] in [[Vienna]], where he was, despite his team's fifth-place finish, voted best goaltender of the tournament, an award earned by only four other Americans in the history of the IIHF ([[Don Rigazio]], '55, [[Willard Ikola]], '56, [[Jack McCartan]], '60 and [[Ty Conklin]], '04). He was also a member of the 1970 and 1971 US national teams, and backstopped a [[Calder Cup]] with the [[Rochester Americans]] in 1967.\n\nWetzel finished his major league career in 1972-73 with the [[World Hockey Association|WHA]] [[Minnesota Fighting Saints]] after spending the previous season in Austria with KAC Kitzbuhel.

The Dunlops of 1958 featured [[Harry Sinden]], [[Charlie Burns]], and [[Sid Smith (ice hockey)|Sid Smith]]. At the time, Carl was the goalie for the [[Hamilton Tiger Cubs]] of the [[Ontario Hockey Association|OHA]] and played against the Dunlops prior to the game against the Russians. Whitby\u2019s coach, [[Wren Blair]], took note of Carl\u2019s play, and upon a knee injury suffered by Whitby goaltender John Henderson, coach Blair called upon the young American to represent Canada against the Russians. It was during this 1958 season with the Tiger Cubs that Carl also played in the OHA all-star game against [[Denis DeJordy]], [[Chico Maki]], [[Matt Ravlich]], [[Pat Stapleton (ice hockey)|Pat Stapleton]], and [[John McKenzie (ice hockey)|John McKenzie]].\n\nHowever, Carl Wetzel is probably best known for starring for the United States ice hockey national team at the 1967 [[Ice Hockey World Championship]] in [[Vienna]], where he was, despite his team's fifth-place finish, voted best goaltender of the tournament, an award earned by only four other Americans in the history of the IIHF ([[Don Rigazio]], '55, [[Willard Ikola]], '56, [[Jack McCartan]], '60 and [[Ty Conklin]], '04). He was also a member of the 1970 and 1971 US national teams, and backstopped a [[Calder Cup]] with the [[Rochester Americans]] in 1967.\n\nWetzel finished his major league career in 1972-73 with the [[World Hockey Association|WHA]] [[Minnesota Fighting Saints]] after spending the previous season in Austria with KAC Kitzbuhel. He would later serve as an assistant coach under [[Herb Brooks]] with the Minnesota North Stars in 1987\u201388.\n\n==External links==\n*{{icehockeystats|legends=18731}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wetzel, Carl}}\n[[Category:1938 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American expatriate sportspeople in Austria]]\n[[Category:American men's ice hockey goaltenders]]\n[[Category:Cleveland Barons (1937\u20131973) players]]\n[[Category:Detroit Red Wings players]]\n[[Category:Eastern Professional Hockey League (1959\u201363) players]]\n[[Category:Edmonton Flyers (WHL) players]]\n[[Category:Fort Wayne Komets players]]\n[[Category:Houston Apollos players]]\n[[Category:Ice hockey people from Michigan]]\n[[Category:Memphis South Stars players]]\n[[Category:Minnesota Fighting Saints players]]\n[[Category:Minnesota North Stars coaches]]\n[[Category:Minnesota North Stars players]]\n[[Category:Pittsburgh Hornets players]]\n[[Category:Quebec Aces (AHL) players]]\n[[Category:Rochester Americans players]]\n[[Category:Spokane Comets players]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Detroit]]\n\n\n{{US-icehockey-goaltender-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toTom Williams(link changed toTom Williams (ice hockey, born 1940)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wetzel"}
