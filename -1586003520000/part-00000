A field is thus a fundamental [[algebraic structure]] which is widely used in [[algebra]], [[number theory]], and many other areas of mathematics.\n\nThe best known fields are the field of [[rational number]]s, the field of [[real number]]s and the field of [[complex number]]s. Many other fields, such as [[field of rational functions|fields of rational functions]], [[algebraic function field]]s, [[algebraic number field]]s, and [[p-adic number|''p''-adic fields]] are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and [[algebraic geometry]]. Most [[cryptographic protocol]]s rely on [[finite field]]s, i.e., fields with finitely many [[element (set)|elements]].\n\nThe relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a [[field extension]]. [[Galois theory]], initiated by [[\u00c9variste Galois]] in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that [[angle trisection]] and [[squaring the circle]] cannot be done with a [[compass and straightedge]]. Moreover, it shows that [[quintic equation]]s are algebraically unsolvable.\n\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of [[mathematical analysis]], which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] for a [[vector space]], which is the standard general context for [[linear algebra]]. [[Number field]]s, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in [[number theory]]. [[Function field of an algebraic variety|Function fields]] can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\n== Definition ==\nInformally, a field is a set, along with two [[binary operation|operation]]s defined on that set: an addition operation written as {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}, and a multiplication operation written as {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}, both of which behave similarly as they behave for [[rational number]]s and [[real number]]s, including the existence of an [[additive inverse]] {{math|&minus;''a''}} for all elements {{mvar|a}}, and of a [[multiplicative inverse]] {{math|''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}} for every nonzero element {{mvar|b}}. This allows one to also consider the so-called ''inverse'' operations of [[Subtraction#Real numbers|subtraction]], {{math|''a'' &minus; ''b''}}, and [[Division (mathematics)|division]], {{math|''a'' / ''b''}}, by defining:\n:{{math|1=''a'' &minus; ''b'' = ''a'' + (&minus;''b'')}},\n:{{math|1=''a'' / ''b'' = ''a'' \u00b7 ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.\n\n===Classic definition===\n\nFormally, a field is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''F''}} together with two [[binary operation|operations]] on {{mvar|F}} called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=Definition 4.1.1, p.&nbsp;181}}</ref> An operation on {{mvar|F}} is a function {{math|''F'' &times; ''F'' &rarr; ''F''}} &ndash; in other words, a mapping that associates an element of {{mvar|F}} to every pair of its elements. The result of the addition of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the sum of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the product of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''ab''}} or {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}. These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as ''[[Axiom#Non-logical axioms|field axioms]]''. In these axioms,  {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are arbitrary [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the field {{mvar|F}}.\n\n==== Requirements for operations ''addition'' and ''multiplication'' on a field ====\n\n* [[Associativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}},  and  {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' \u00b7 ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') \u00b7 ''c''}}.\n* [[Commutativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}}, and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''b'' = ''b'' \u00b7 ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive identity|Additive]] and [[multiplicative identity]]: there exist two different elements {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} in {{math|''F''}} such that {{math|1=''a'' + 0 = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 1 = ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted {{math|\u2212''a''}}, called the ''additive inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' + (\u2212''a'') = 0}}.\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted by {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} or {{math|1/''a''}}, called the ''multiplicative inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> = 1}}.\n* [[Distributivity]] of multiplication over addition: {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') + (''a'' \u00b7 ''c'')}}.\n\nThis may be summarized by saying: a field has two operations, called addition and multiplication; it is an [[abelian group]] under addition with 0 as the additive identity; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under multiplication with 1 as the multiplicative identity; and multiplication distributes over addition.\n\n===Alternative definition===\nFields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (operations taking two elements to form a new element) , that are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and their required properties. [[Division by zero]] is, by definition, excluded.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clark|1984|loc=Chapter 3}}.</ref> In order to avoid [[existential quantifier]]s, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses respectively), and two [[arity#Nullary|nullary]] operations (the constants {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[computing]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Mines|Richman|Ruitenburg|1988|loc=\u00a7II.2}}. See also [[Heyting field]].</ref> One may equivalently define a field by the same two binary operations, one unary operation (the multiplicative inverse), and two constants {{math|1}} and {{math|\u22121}}, since {{math|1=0 = 1 + (\u22121)}} and {{math|1=&minus;''a'' = (&minus;1)''a''}}.<ref group=nb>The a priori twofold use of the symbol \"\u2212\" for denoting one part of a constant and for the additive inverses is justified by this latter condition.</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Rational numbers===\n{{main|Rational number}}\nRational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.\nThey are numbers that can be written as [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]\n{{math|''a''/''b''}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are [[integer]]s, and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. The additive inverse of such a fraction is {{math|\u2212''a''/''b''}}, and the multiplicative inverse (provided that {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}) is {{math|''b''/''a''}}, which can be seen as follows:\n\n: <math> \\frac b a \\cdot \\frac a b  = \\frac{ba}{ab} = 1.</math>\n\nThe abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac a b \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d + \\frac e f \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b  \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d  \\cdot \\frac f f + \\frac e f \\cdot \\frac d d \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{cf}{df} + \\frac{ed}{fd}\\right) = \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{cf + ed}{df} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a(cf + ed)}{bdf} = \\frac{acf}{bdf} +  \\frac{aed}{bdf} = \\frac{ac}{bd} +  \\frac{ae}{bf} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac c d + \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac e f.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Real and complex numbers===\n\n[[File:Complex_multi.svg|thumb|255px|The multiplication of complex numbers can be visualized geometrically by rotations and scalings.]]\n\n{{main|Real number| Complex number}}\nThe [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}} consist of expressions\n:{{math|''a'' + ''bi'',}} with {{math|''a'', ''b''}} real,\nwhere {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}.\nAddition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for {{math|'''C'''}}. For example, the distributive law enforces\n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''bi'')(''c'' + ''di'') = ''ac'' + ''bci'' + ''adi'' + ''bdi''<sup>2</sup> = ''ac''\u2212''bd'' + (''bc'' + ''ad'')''i''.}}\nIt is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], with [[Cartesian coordinates]] given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is &ndash;less intuitively&ndash; combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.\n\n===Constructible numbers===\n[[File:Root_construction_geometric_mean5.svg|thumb|255px|The [[geometric mean theorem]] asserts that {{math|1=''h''<sup>2</sup> = ''pq''}}. Choosing {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1}} allows construction of the square root of a given constructible number {{math|''p''}}.]]\n{{main|Constructible numbers}}\n \nIn antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with [[compass and straightedge]]. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle in this way. These problems can be settled using the field of [[constructible numbers]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Chapter 13.4}}</ref> Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only [[compass]] and [[straightedge]]. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field {{math|'''Q'''}} of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of [[square root]]s of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within {{math|'''Q'''}}. Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments {{math|''AB''}}, {{math|''BD''}}, and a [[semicircle]] over {{math|''AD''}} (center at the [[midpoint]] {{math|''C''}}), which intersects the [[perpendicular]] line through {{math|''B''}} in a point {{math|''F''}}, at a distance of exactly <math>h=\\sqrt p</math> from {{math|''B''}} when {{math|''BD''}} has length one.\n\nNot all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that <math>\\sqrt[3] 2</math> is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a [[Doubling the cube|cube with volume 2]], another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.\n\n===A field with four elements===\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center;\"| Addition\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center'\"| Multiplication\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| + !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|}\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| \u00b7 !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|}\n|}\n\nIn addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called {{math|''O''}}, {{math|''I''}}, {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''B''}}. The notation is chosen such that {{math|''O''}} plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,\n\n: {{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 (''B'' + ''A'') = ''A'' \u00b7 ''I'' = ''A''}}, which equals {{nowrap|1={{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 ''B'' + ''A'' \u00b7 ''A'' = ''I'' + ''B'' = ''A''}}}}, as required by the distributivity.\n\nThis field is called a [[finite field]] with four elements, and is denoted {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} or {{math|GF(4)}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Example 1.62}}</ref> The subset consisting of {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the ''[[binary field]]'' {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} or {{math|GF(2)}}. In the context of [[computer science]] and [[Boolean algebra]], {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} are often denoted respectively by ''false'' and ''true'', the addition is then denoted [[XOR]] (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted [[Bitwise AND|AND]]. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with [[bit]]s.\n\n==Elementary notions==\nIn this section, {{math|''F''}} denotes an arbitrary field and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary [[element (set theory)|elements]] of {{math|''F''}}.\n\n===Consequences of the definition===\nOne has {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 0 = 0}} and {{math|1=\u2212''a'' = (\u22121) \u00b7 ''a''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref> In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows {{math|\u20131}}.\n\nIf {{math|1=''ab'' = 0}} then {{math|1=''a''}} or {{math|''b''}} must be 0. Indeed, if ''a''&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;0, then \n{{math|1=0 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>\u22c50 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>(''ab'') = (''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>''a'')''b'' = ''b''}}. This means that every field is an [[integral domain]].\n\n===The additive and the multiplicative group of a field===\nThe axioms of a field {{math|''F''}} imply that it is an [[abelian group]] under addition. This group is called the [[additive group]] of the field, and is sometimes denoted by {{math|(''F'', +)}} when denoting it simply as {{math|''F''}} could be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, the ''nonzero'' elements of {{math|''F''}} form an abelian group under multiplication, called the [[multiplicative group]], and denoted by {{math|(''F'' \\ {0}, \u00b7)}} or just {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} or {{math|''F''<sup>*</sup>}}. \n\nA field may thus be defined as set {{math|''F''}} equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that {{math|''F''}} is an abelian group under addition, {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] over addition.<ref group=nb>Equivalently, a field is an [[algebraic structure]] {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u00b7, \u2212, <sup>\u22121</sup>, 0, 1\u27e9}} of type {{math|\u27e82, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0\u27e9}}, such that {{math|0<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is not defined, {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u2013, 0\u27e9}} and \n{{math|\u27e8''F'' \u2216 {0}, \u00b7, <sup>\u22121</sup>\u27e9}} are abelian groups, and \n\u00b7 is distributive over +. {{harvtxt|Wallace|1998|loc=Th. 2}}</ref> Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses {{math|\u2212''a''}} and {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} are uniquely determined by {{math|''a''}}.\n\nThe requirement {{math|1 \u2260 0}} follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Sharpe|1987|loc=Theorem 1.3.2}}</ref> Thus, the [[trivial ring]], consisting of a single element, is not a field.\n\nEvery finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is [[cyclic group|cyclic]] (see {{slink|Root of unity|Cyclic groups}}).\n\n===Characteristic===\nIn addition to the multiplication of two elements of ''F'', it is possible to define the product {{math|''n'' \u22c5 ''a''}} of an arbitrary element {{math|''a''}} of {{math|''F''}} by a positive [[integer]] {{math|''n''}} to be the {{math|''n''}}-fold sum\n:{{math|''a'' + ''a'' + ... + ''a''}} (which is an element of  {{math|''F''}}.)\n\nIf there is no positive integer such that\n:{{math|1=''n'' \u22c5 1 = 0}},\nthen {{math|''F''}} is said to have [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=\u00a7I.2, p.&nbsp;10}}</ref> For example, the field of rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} has characteristic 0 since no positive integer {{math|''n''}} is zero. Otherwise, if there ''is'' a positive integer {{math|''n''}} satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a [[prime number]]. It is usually denoted by {{math|''p''}} and the field is said to have characteristic {{math|''p''}} then.\nFor example, the field {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) {{math| 1= I + I = O }}.\n\nIf {{math|''F''}} has characteristic {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|1=''p'' \u22c5 ''a'' = 0}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}. This implies that \n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''b'')<sup>''p''</sup> = ''a''<sup>''p''</sup> + ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>}},\nsince all other [[binomial coefficient]]s appearing in the [[binomial formula]] are divisible by {{math|''p''}}. Here, {{math|1=''a''<sup>''p''</sup> := ''a'' \u22c5 ''a'' \u22c5 ... \u22c5 ''a''}} ({{math|''p''}} factors) is the {{math|''p''}}-th power, i.e., the {{math|''p''}}-fold product of the element {{math|''a''}}. Therefore, the [[Frobenius map]]\n:{{math|Fr: ''F'' &rarr; ''F'', ''x'' \u27fc ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>}}\nis compatible with the addition in {{math|''F''}} (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Escofier|2012|loc=14.4.2}}</ref> The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic {{math|''p''}} quite different from fields of characteristic 0.\n\n===Subfields and prime fields===\nA ''[[Field extension|subfield]]'' {{math|''E''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that is a field with respect to the field operations of {{math|''F''}}. Equivalently {{math|''E''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that contains {{math|1}}, and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that {{math|1 \u220a ''E''}}, that for all {{math|''a'', ''b'' \u220a ''E''}} both {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' \u00b7 ''b''}} are in {{math|''E''}}, and that for all {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''E''}}, both {{math|\u2013''a''}} and {{math|1/''a''}} are in {{math|''E''}}.\n\n[[Field homomorphism]]s are maps {{math|''f'': ''E'' &rarr; ''F''}} between two fields such that {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub> + ''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>) + ''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>)''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, and {{math|1=''f''(1<sub>E</sub>) = 1<sub>F</sub>}}, where {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''e''<sub>2</sub>}} are arbitrary elements of {{math|''E''}}.

Any field {{math|''F''}} contains a prime field. If the characteristic of {{math|''F''}} is {{math|''p''}} (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} introduced below.

The above introductory example {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} is a field with four elements.

For a fixed positive integer {{math|''n''}}, arithmetic \"modulo {{math|''n''}}\" means to work with the numbers\n:{{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' = {0, 1, ..., ''n'' \u2212 1}.}}\nThe addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, dividing by {{math|''n''}} and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if {{math|''n''}} is a [[prime number]]. For example, taking the prime {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2}} results in the above-mentioned field {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}. For {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}} and more generally, for any [[composite number]] (i.e., any number {{math|''n''}} which can be expressed as a product {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r''\u22c5''s''}} of two strictly smaller natural numbers), {{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since {{math|1=''r''\u22c5''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}} in {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}, which, as was explained [[#Consequences of the definition|above]], prevents {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} from being a field. The field {{math|'''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}} with {{math|''p''}} elements ({{math|''p''}} being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by  {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\nEvery finite field {{math|''F''}} has {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements, where {{math|1=''p''}} is prime and {{math|''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;1}}. This statement holds since {{math|''F''}} may be viewed as a [[vector space]] over its prime field. The [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of this vector space is necessarily finite, say {{math|''n''}}, which implies the asserted statement.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Lemma 2.1, Theorem 2.2}}</ref>\n\nA field with {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements can be constructed as the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial \n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>''q''</sup> &minus; ''x''}}.\nSuch a splitting field is an extension of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} in which the polynomial {{math|''f''}} has {{math|''q''}} zeros. This means {{math|''f''}} has as many zeros as possible since the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|''q''}}. For {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}}, it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} satisfy the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''}}, so they are zeros of {{math|''f''}}. By contrast, in {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{math|''f''}} has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so {{math|''f''}} does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Theorem 1.2.5}}</ref> It is thus customary to speak of ''the'' finite field with {{math|''q''}} elements, denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} or {{math|GF(''q'')}}.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 63}}</ref> A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who observed that permuting the zeros {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>}} of a [[cubic polynomial]] in the expression\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub> + &omega;''x''<sub>2</sub> + &omega;<sup>2</sup>''x''<sub>3</sub>)<sup>3</sup>}}\n(with {{math|&omega;}} being a third [[root of unity]]) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te]], which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown {{math|''x''}} to an quadratic equation for {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kiernan|1971|loc=p. 50}}</ref> Together with a similar observation for [[quartic polynomial|equations of degree 4]], Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=pp. 75\u201376}}</ref> [[Alexandre-Th\u00e9ophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]], also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1801), studied the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''p''</sup> = 1}}\nfor a prime {{math|''p''}} and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic [[Galois group]]. Gauss deduced that a [[regular polygon|regular {{math|''p''}}-gon]] can be constructed if {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2<sup>''k''</sup></sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}}. Building on Lagrange's work, [[Paolo Ruffini]] claimed (1799) that [[quintic equation]]s (polynomial equations of degree 5) cannot be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by [[Niels Henrik Abel]] in 1824.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p.24}}</ref> [[\u00c9variste Galois]], in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as [[Galois theory]] today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an [[algebraic number field]], but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.\n\nIn 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the [[German (language)|German]] word ''K\u00f6rper'', which means \"body\" or \"corpus\" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term \"field\" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Moore|1893}}.<ref>[http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html ''Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (F)'']</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=By a field we will mean every infinite system of real or complex numbers so closed in itself and perfect that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two of these numbers again yields a number of the system.\n|author=Richard Dedekind, 1871<ref>{{harvtxt|Dirichlet|1871|loc=p. 42}}, translation by {{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 66}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1881 [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a ''domain of rationality'', which is a field of [[rational fraction]]s in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as {{math|'''Q'''(&pi;)}} abstractly as the rational function field {{math|'''Q'''(''X'')}}. Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since [[Joseph Liouville]]'s work in 1844, until [[Charles Hermite]] (1873) and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] (1882) proved the transcendence of {{math|''e''}} and {{math|&pi;}}, respectively.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 81}}</ref>\n\nThe first clear definition of an abstract field is due to {{harvtxt|Weber|1893}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p. 33}}. See also {{harvtxt|Fricke|Weber|1924}}.</ref> In particular, [[Heinrich Martin Weber]]'s notion included the field '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>. [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led {{harvtxt|Hensel|1904}} to introduce the field of ''p''-adic numbers. {{harvtxt|Steinitz|1910}} synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections [[#Galois theory|Galois theory]], [[#Constructing fields|Constructing fields]] and [[#Elementary notions|Elementary notions]] can be found in Steinitz's work. {{harvtxt|Artin|Schreier|1927}} linked the notion of [[ordered field|orderings in a field]], and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 92}}</ref> [[Emil Artin]] redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the [[primitive element theorem]].\n\n==Constructing fields==\n\n===Constructing fields from rings===\nA [[commutative ring]] is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses {{math|''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7II.1}}</ref> For example, the integers {{math|'''Z'''}} form a commutative ring, but not a field: the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of an integer {{math|''n''}} is not itself an integer, unless {{math|1=''n'' = \u00b11}}.\n\nIn the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings {{math|''R''}} in which every nonzero element is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are the commutative rings with precisely two distinct [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, {{math|(0)}} and {{math|''R''}}. Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which {{math|(0)}} is the only [[prime ideal]].\n\nGiven a commutative ring {{math|''R''}}, there are two ways to construct a field related to {{math|''R''}}, i.e., two ways of modifying {{math|''R''}} such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of {{math|'''Z'''}} is {{math|'''Q'''}}, the rationals, while the residue fields of {{math|'''Z'''}} are the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\n====Field of fractions====\n\nGiven an [[integral domain]] {{math|''R''}}, its [[field of fractions]] {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} is built with the fractions of two elements of {{math|''R''}} exactly as '''Q''' is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} are the fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}  are in {{math|''R''}}, and  {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. Two fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} and  {{math|''c''/''d''}} are equal if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, \n:<math>\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.</math>\nIt is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 10.6}}</ref>\n\nThe field {{math|''F''(''x'')}} of the [[rational fraction]]s over a field (or an integral domain) {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''F''[''x'']}}. The field {{math|''F''((''x''))}} of [[Laurent series]]\n:<math>\\sum_{i=k}^\\infty a_i x^i \\ (k \\in \\Z, a_i \\in F)</math>\nover a field {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the ring {{math|''F''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''x'']]}} of [[formal power series]] (in which {{math|''k'' &ge; 0}}). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of {{math|''x''}} (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.\n\n====Residue fields====\nIn addition to the field of fractions, which embeds {{math|''R''}} [[injective map|injectively]] into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring {{math|''R''}} by means of a [[surjective map]] onto a field {{math|''F''}}. Any field obtained in this way is a [[quotient ring|quotient]] {{math|{{nowrap|''R'' / ''m''}}}}, where {{math|''m''}} is a [[maximal ideal]] of {{math|''R''}}. If {{math|''R''}} [[local ring|has only one maximal ideal]] {{math|''m''}}, this field is called the [[residue field]] of {{math|''R''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=p. 60}}</ref>\n\nThe [[principal ideal|ideal generated by a single polynomial]] {{math|''f''}} in the polynomial ring {{math|1=''R'' = ''E''[''X'']}} (over a field {{math|''E''}}) is maximal if and only if {{math|''f''}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] in {{math|''E''}}, i.e., if {{math|''f''}} cannot be expressed as the product of two polynomials in {{math|''E''[''X'']}} of smaller [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]. This yields a field\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / (''f''(''X'')).}}\nThis field {{math|''F''}} contains an element {{math|''x''}} (namely the [[residue class]] of {{math|''X''}}) which satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 0}}.\nFor example, {{math|'''C'''}} is obtained from {{math|'''R'''}} by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] the [[imaginary unit]] symbol {{mvar|i}}, which satisfies {{math|1=''f''(''i'') = 0}}, where {{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}}. Moreover, {{math|''f''}} is irreducible over {{math|'''R'''}}, which implies that the map that sends a polynomial {{math|''f''(''X'') \u220a '''R'''[''X'']}} to {{math|''f''(''i'')}} yields an isomorphism\n:<math>\\mathbf R[X]/\\left(X^2 + 1\\right) \\ \\stackrel \\cong \\longrightarrow \\ \\mathbf C.</math>\n\n===Constructing fields within a bigger field===\nFields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field {{math|''E''}}, and a field {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} as a subfield. For any element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''F''}}, there is a smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''x''}}, called the subfield of ''F'' generated by {{math|''x''}} and denoted {{math|''E''(''x'')}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|loc=p. 213}}</ref> The passage from {{math|''E''}} to {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is referred to by ''[[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element'' to {{math|''E''}}. More generally, for a subset {{math|''S'' \u2282 ''F''}}, there is a minimal subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''S''}}, denoted by {{math|''E''(''S'')}}.\n\nThe [[compositum]] of two subfields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E' ''}} of some field {{math|''F''}} is the smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing both {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E'.''}} The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}} satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}}, which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over {{math|''E''}}.<ref group=nb>Further examples include the maximal [[unramified extension]] or the maximal [[abelian extension]] within {{math|''F''}}.</ref>\n\n===Field extensions===\n{{See|Glossary of field theory}}\nThe notion of a subfield {{math|''E'' \u2282 ''F''}} can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to {{math|''F''}} being a ''[[field extension]]'' (or just extension) of {{math|''E''}}, denoted by\n:{{math|''F'' / ''E''}},\nand read \"{{math|''F''}} over {{math|''E''}}\".\n\nA basic datum of a field extension is its [[degree of a field extension|degree]] {{math|[''F'' : ''E'']}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''F''}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space. It satisfies the formula<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Theorem 13.3.4}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=[''G'' : ''E''] = [''G'' : ''F''] [''F'' : ''E'']}}.\nExtensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions {{math|'''C''' / '''R'''}} and {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub> / '''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} are of degree 2, whereas {{math|'''R''' / '''Q'''}} is an infinite extension.\n\n====Algebraic extensions====\nA pivotal notion in the study of field extensions {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} are [[algebraic element]]s. An element {{tmath|x\\in F}} is ''algebraic'' over {{mvar|E}} if it is a [[zero of a function|root]] of a [[polynomial]] with coefficients in {{mvar|E}}, that is, if it satisfies a [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''e''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''e''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''e''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''e''<sub>0</sub> = 0}},\nwith {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>0</sub>}} in {{mvar|E}}, and {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub> &ne; 0}}. \nFor example, the [[imaginary unit]] {{math|''i''}} in  {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraic over {{math|'''R'''}}, and even over {{math|'''Q'''}}, since it satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}.\nA field extension in which every element of {{math|''F''}} is algebraic over {{math|''E''}} is called an [[algebraic extension]]. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Corollary 13.3.6}}</ref>\n\nThe subfield {{math|''E''(''x'')}} generated by an element {{math|''x''}}, as above, is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} if and only if {{math|''x''}} is an algebraic element. That is to say, if {{math|''x''}} is algebraic, all other elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, equals the minimal degree {{math|''n''}} such that there is a polynomial equation involving {{math|''x''}}, as above. If this degree is {{math|''n''}}, then the elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} have the form \n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k, \\ \\ a_k \\in E.</math>\n\nFor example, the field {{math|'''Q'''(''i'')}} of [[Gaussian rational]]s is the subfield of {{math|'''C'''}} consisting of all numbers of the form {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are rational numbers: summands of the form {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup>}} (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since {{math|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''ci''<sup>2</sup>}} can be simplified to {{math|''a'' &minus; ''c'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n====Transcendence bases====\nThe above-mentioned field of [[rational fraction]]s {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, where {{math|''X''}} is an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]], is not an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in {{math|''E''}} whose zero is {{math|''X''}}. Elements, such as {{math|''X''}}, which are not algebraic are called [[Algebraic element|transcendental]]. Informally speaking, the indeterminate {{math|''X''}} and its powers do not interact with elements of {{math|''E''}}. A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.\n\nOnce again, the field extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}} discussed above is a key example: if {{math|''x''}} is not algebraic (i.e., {{math|''x''}} is not a [[root of a function|root]] of a polynomial with coefficients in {{math|''E''}}), then {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}. This isomorphism is obtained by substituting {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''X''}} in rational fractions.\n\nA subset {{math|''S''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a [[transcendence basis]] if it is [[algebraically independent]] (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over {{math|''E''}} and if {{math|''F''}} is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''(''S'')}}. Any field extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} has a transcendence basis.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter V, \u00a714, No. 2, Theorem 1}}</ref> Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form {{math|''E''(''S'') / ''E''}} ([[transcendental extension|purely transcendental extensions]]) and algebraic extensions.\n\n===Closure operations===\nA field is [[algebraically closed]] if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''f''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''f''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''f''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0}}, with [[coefficient]]s {{math|''f''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>0</sub> \u2208 ''F'', ''n'' > 0}},\nhas a solution {{math|''x'' \u220a ''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 13.9}}</ref> By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, i.e., ''any'' polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are ''not'' algebraically closed since the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}\ndoes not have any rational or real solution. A field containing {{math|''F''}} is called an ''[[algebraic closure]]'' of {{math|''F''}} if it is [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] over {{math|''F''}} (roughly speaking, not too big compared to {{math|''F''}}) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).\n\nBy the above, {{math|'''C'''}} is an algebraic closure of {{math|'''R'''}}. The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field {{math|''F''}} is quite special: by the [[Artin-Schreier theorem]], the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and {{math|''F''}} is [[elementarily equivalent]] to {{math|'''R'''}}. Such fields are also known as [[real closed field]]s.\n\nAny field {{math|''F''}} has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as ''the'' algebraic closure and denoted {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}}. For example, the algebraic closure {{math|{{Overline|'''Q'''}}}} of {{math|'''Q'''}} is called the field of [[algebraic number]]s. The field {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}} is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the [[ultrafilter lemma]], a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Banaschewski|1992}}. [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46566/is-the-statement-that-every-field-has-an-algebraic-closure-known-to-be-equivalent Mathoverflow post]</ref> In this regard, the algebraic closure of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}}, is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (the ones of order {{math|''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}}). For any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field {{math|''F''((''t''))}} of [[Laurent series]] is the field of [[Puiseux series]], obtained by adjoining roots of {{math|''t''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ribenboim|1999|loc=p. 186, \u00a77.1}}</ref>\n\n==Fields with additional structure==\nSince fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.\n\n===Ordered fields===\n{{main|Ordered field}}\nA field ''F'' is called an ''ordered field'' if any two elements can be compared, so that {{math|''x'' + ''y'' \u2265 0}} and {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} whenever {{math|''x''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} and {{math|''y''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}}. For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering&nbsp;{{math|\u2265}}. The [[Artin-Schreier theorem]] states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a [[formally real field]], which means that any quadratic equation\n:<math>x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 = 0</math>\nonly has the solution {{math|1=''x''<sub>1</sub> = ''x''<sub>2</sub> = ... = ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter VI, \u00a72.3, Corollary 1}}</ref> The set of all possible orders on a fixed field {{math|''F''}} is isomorphic to the set of [[ring homomorphism]]s from the [[Witt ring (forms)|Witt ring]] {{math|W(''F'')}} of [[quadratic form]]s over {{math|''F''}}, to {{math|'''Z'''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lorenz|2008|loc=\u00a722, Theorem 1}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Archimedean field]] is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression\n:{{math|1 + 1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1}}\nwhose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements.  Equivalently, the field contains no [[infinitesimals]] (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|Each bounded real set has a least upper bound.]]\nAn ordered field is [[Dedekind-complete]] if all [[upper bound]]s, [[lower bound]]s (see [[Dedekind cut]]) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each [[bounded set|bounded subset]] of {{math|''F''}} is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean,<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Proposition 1.22}}</ref> since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence {{math|1/2, 1/3, 1/4, &hellip;}}, every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.\n\nSince every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, {{math|'''R'''}} is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Theorem 1.23}}</ref> Several foundational results in [[calculus]] follow directly from this characterization of the reals.\n\nThe [[hyperreals]] {{math|'''R'''<sup>*</sup>}} form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of [[non-standard analysis]].\n\n===Topological fields===\nAnother refinement of the notion of a field is a [[topological field]], in which the set {{math|''F''}} is a [[topological space]], such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps {{math|''a'' \u21a6 &minus;''a''}} and {{math|''a'' \u21a6 ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}) are [[continuous map]]s with respect to the topology of the space.<ref>{{harvtxt|Warner|1989|loc=Chapter 14}}</ref>\nThe topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], i.e., a function\n:{{math|''d'' : ''F'' \u00d7 ''F'' \u2192 '''R''',}}\nthat measures a ''distance'' between any two elements of {{math|''F''}}.\n\nThe [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of {{math|''F''}} is another field in which, informally speaking, the \"gaps\" in the original field {{math|''F''}} are filled, if there are any. For example, any [[irrational number]] {{math|''x''}}, such as {{math|1=''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{radic|2}}}}, is a \"gap\" in the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers {{math|''p''/''q''}}, in the sense that distance of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p''/''q''}} given by the [[absolute value]] {{math|{{!}} ''x'' \u2013 ''p''/''q'' {{!}}}} is as small as desired.\nThe following table lists some examples of this construction.

The algebraic closure {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} carries a unique norm extending the one on {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is sometimes called the field of [[p-adic number|Metric completions and algebraic closures|complex p-adic number]]s and is denoted by {{math|'''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|1997|loc=\u00a75.7}}</ref>\n\n====Local fields====\nThe following topological fields are called ''[[local field]]s'':<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1979}}</ref><ref group=nb>Some authors also consider the fields {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} to be local fields.

In this relation, the elements {{math|''p'' \u2208 '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|''t'' \u2208 '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}} (referred to as [[uniformizer]]) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}. (However, since the addition in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is done using [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]]ing, which is not the case in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:\n* Any [[first order logic|first order]] statement that is true for almost all {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is also true for almost all {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}. An application of this is the [[Ax-Kochen theorem]] describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n* [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|Tamely ramified extension]]s of both fields are in bijection to one another.\n* Adjoining arbitrary {{math|''p''}}-power roots of {{math|''p''}} (in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}), respectively of {{math|''t''}} (in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as [[perfectoid field]]s. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields:<ref>{{harvtxt|Scholze|2014}}</ref>\n::<math>\\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf Q_p\\left(p^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right) \\cong \\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf F_p((t))\\left(t^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right).</math>\n\n===Differential fields===\n[[Differential field]]s are fields equipped with a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field.<ref>{{harvtxt|van der Put|Singer|2003|loc=\u00a71}}</ref> For example, the field '''R'''(''X''), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to [[differential Galois theory]], a variant of Galois theory dealing with [[linear differential equation]]s.\n\n==Galois theory==\n{{main|Galois theory}}\n\nGalois theory studies [[algebraic extension]]s of a field by studying the [[Symmetry group#Symmetry groups in general|symmetry]] in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are [[finite extension|finite]] [[Galois extension]]s {{math|''F'' / ''E''}}, which are, by definition, those that are [[separable extension|separable]] and [[normal extension|normal]]. The [[primitive element theorem]] shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily [[simple extension|simple]], i.e., of the form\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / ''f''(''X'')}},\nwhere {{math|''f''}} is an irreducible polynomial (as above).<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Theorem V.4.6}}</ref> For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of {{math|''f''}} are contained in {{math|''F''}} and that {{math|''f''}} has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if {{math|''E''}} has characteristic 0.\n\nFor a finite Galois extension, the [[Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} is the group of [[field automorphism]]s of {{math|''F''}} that are trivial on {{math|''E''}} (i.e., the [[bijection]]s {{math|\u03c3 : ''F'' \u2192 ''F''}} that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of {{math|''E''}} to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], which constructs an explicit [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the set of [[subgroup]]s of {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension {{math|''F''/''E''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7VI.1}}</ref> By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not [[solvable group|solvable]] (cannot be built from [[abelian group]]s), then the zeros of {{math|''f''}} ''cannot'' be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving <math>\\sqrt[n]{\\ }</math>. For example, the [[symmetric group]]s {{math|S<sub>''n''</sub>}} is not solvable for {{math|''n''&ge;5}}. Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]:\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>5</sup> &minus; 4''X'' + 2}} (and {{math|1=''E'' = '''Q'''}}),<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Example VI.2.6}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>''X''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} (where {{math|''f''}} is regarded as a polynomial in {{math|''E''(''a''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>)}}, for some indeterminates {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, {{math|''E''}} is any field, and {{math|''n'' &ge; 5}}).\n\nThe [[tensor product of fields]] is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} of degree {{math|''n''}} is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of {{math|''F''}}-algebras\n:{{math|''F''  \u2297<sub>''E''</sub> ''F'' \u2245 ''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\nThis fact is the beginning of [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.<ref>{{harvtxt|Borceux|Janelidze|2001}}. See also [[\u00c9tale fundamental group]].</ref>\n\n==Invariants of fields==\n\nBasic invariants of a field {{math|''F''}} include the characteristic and the [[transcendence degree]] of {{math|''F''}} over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in {{math|''F''}} that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|2012|loc=Theorem 6.4.8}}</ref> This implies that any two [[uncountable]] algebraically closed fields of the same [[cardinality]] and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>, '''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''C'''}} are isomorphic (but ''not'' isomorphic as topological fields).\n\n===Model theory of fields===\nIn [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], two fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called [[elementarily equivalent]] if every mathematical statement that is true for {{math|''E''}} is also true for {{math|''F''}} and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is\n:{{math|&phi;(''E'')}} = \"for any {{math|''n'' > 0}}, any polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''E''}} has a zero in {{math|''E''}}\" (which amounts to saying that {{math|''E''}} is algebraically closed).\nThe [[Lefschetz principle]] states that {{math|'''C'''}} is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement {{math|&phi;}} holds in {{math|'''C'''}} if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Marker|Messmer|Pillay|2006|loc=Corollary 1.2}}</ref>\n\nIf {{math|''U''}} is an [[ultrafilter]] on a set {{math|''I''}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a field for every {{math|''i''}} in {{math|''I''}}, the [[ultraproduct]] of the {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''U''}} is a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Schoutens|2002|loc=\u00a72}}</ref> It is denoted by\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''i''&rarr;\u221e</sub> ''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}},\nsince it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}: [[\u0141o\u015b's theorem]] states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence {{math|&phi;}}, this shows that there is an isomorphism<ref group=nb>Both {{math|'''C'''}} and {{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> {{overline|'''F'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} are algebraically closed by \u0141o\u015b's theorem.

Finally, they are both uncountable, so that they are isomorphic.</ref>\n:<math>\\operatorname{ulim}_{p \\to \\infty} \\overline \\mathbf F_p \\cong \\mathbf C.</math>\nThe Ax\u2013Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes {{math|''p''}})\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> \u2245 ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}.\nIn addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as [[real closed field]]s or [[exponential field]]s (which are equipped with an exponential function  {{math|exp : ''F'' &rarr; ''F''<sup>x</sup>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Kuhlmann|2000}}</ref>\n\n===The absolute Galois group===\nFor fields that are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the [[absolute Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F'')}} is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs ''all'' finite separable extensions of {{math|''F''}}. By elementary means, the group {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} can be shown to be the [[Pr\u00fcfer group]], the [[profinite completion]] of {{math|'''Z'''}}. This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} are the fields {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub>)}} for {{math|''n'' > 0}}, and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by\n:{{math|1=Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub> / '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) = '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}.\nA description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of {{math|''p''}}-adic number fields (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Jannsen|Wingberg|1982}}</ref>\n\n[[Galois representation|Representations of Galois groups]] and of related groups such as the [[Weil group]] are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the [[Langlands program]]. The cohomological study of such representations is done using [[Galois cohomology]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|2002}}</ref> For example, the [[Brauer group]], which is classically defined as the group of [[central simple algebra|central simple {{math|''F''}}-algebras]], can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely\n:{{math|1=Br(''F'') = H<sup>2</sup>(''F'', '''G'''<sub>m</sub>)}}.\n\n===K-theory===\n[[Milnor K-theory]] is defined as\n:<math>K_n^M(F) = F^\\times \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes F^\\times / \\langle x \\otimes (1-x)\\mid x \\in F \\smallsetminus \\{0, 1\\} \\rangle.</math>\nThe [[norm residue isomorphism theorem]], proved around 2000 by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]], relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism\n:<math>K_n^M(F) / p = H^n(F, \\mu_l^{\\otimes n}).</math>\n[[Algebraic K-theory]] is related to the group of [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the [[determinant (mathematics)|determinant]] of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K<sub>1</sub>(''F'') = ''F''<sup>&times;</sup>. [[Matsumoto's theorem (K-theory)|Matsumoto's theorem]] shows that K<sub>2</sub>(''F'') agrees with K<sub>2</sub><sup>M</sup>(''F''). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Linear algebra and commutative algebra===\n[[File:euler2a.gif|thumb|[[Euler angles]] express the relation of different coordinate systems, i.e., bases of {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}.

This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=\u00a73.3}}</ref> Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in [[linear algebra]] both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.\n\n[[module (mathematics)|Modules]] (the analogue of vector spaces) over most [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, including the ring {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring {{math|''R''}} is a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} in its own right. Such rings are called [[algebra over a field|{{math|''F''}}-algebras]] and are studied in depth in the area of [[commutative algebra]]. For example, [[Noether normalization]] asserts that any [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated {{math|''F''}}-algebra]] is closely related to (more precisely, [[finitely generated module|finitely generated as a module]] over) a polynomial ring {{math|''F''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>]}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Theorem 13.3}}</ref>\n\n===Finite fields: cryptography and coding theory===\n\n[[File:ECClines.svg|thumb|The sum of three points ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' on an elliptic curve ''E'' (red) is zero if there is a line (blue) passing through these points.]]\nA widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''a'' \u22c5 ''a'' \u22c5 ... \u22c5 ''a''}} ({{math|''n''}} factors, for an integer {{math|''n'' \u2265 1}})\nin a (large) finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} can be performed much more efficiently than the [[discrete logarithm]], which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution {{math|''n''}} to an equation\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''b''}}.\nIn [[elliptic curve cryptography]], the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an [[elliptic curve]], i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form\n:{{math|1=''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''}}.\n\nFinite fields are also used in [[coding theory]] and [[combinatorics]].\n\n===Geometry: field of functions===\n[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A compact Riemann surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] two (two handles). The genus can be read off the field of meromorphic functions on the surface.]]\n[[function (mathematics)|Functions]] on a suitable [[topological space]] {{math|''X''}} into a field {{mvar|k}} can be added and multiplied pointwise, e.g., the product of two functions is defined by the product of their values within the domain:\n:{{math|1={{nowrap|1=(''f'' \u22c5 ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u22c5 ''g''(''x'')}}}}.\nThis makes these functions a {{mvar|k}}-[[associative algebra|commutative algebra]].\n\nFor having a ''field'' of functions, one must consider algebras of functions that are [[integral domains]]. In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form\n:<math>\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)},</math>\nform a field, called field of functions.\n\nThis occurs in two main cases. When {{math|''X''}} is a [[complex manifold]] {{math|''X''}}. In this case, one considers the algebra of [[holomorphic functions]], i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of  [[meromorphic function]]s on {{math|''X''}}.\n\nThe [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of an [[algebraic variety]] {{math|''X''}} (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of [[regular function]]s, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[affine space|space]] over a field {{math|''k''}} is {{math|''k''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in {{math|''n''}} indeterminates. The function field of {{math|''X''}} is the same as the one of any [[Zariski topology|open]] dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing {{math|''X''}} by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.\n\nThe function field is invariant under [[isomorphism]] and [[birational equivalence]] of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of [[abstract algebraic variety|abstract algebraic varieties]] and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]], which equals the transcendence degree of {{math|''k''(''X'')}}, is invariant under birational equivalence.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=\u00a713, Theorem A}}</ref> For [[algebraic curve|curves]] (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field {{math|''k''(''X'')}} is very close to {{math|''X''}}: if {{math|''X''}} is [[smooth variety|smooth]] and [[proper map|proper]] (the analogue of being [[compact topological space|compact]]), {{math|''X''}} can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions.<ref group=nb>More precisely, there is an [[equivalence of categories]] between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} and finite field extensions of {{math|''F''(''T'')}}.</ref> In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about {{math|''X''}}. The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as [[birational geometry]]. The [[minimal model program]] attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.\n\n===Number theory: global fields===\n\n[[Global field]]s are in the limelight in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[arithmetic geometry]].\nThey are, by definition, [[number field]]s (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''}}) or function fields over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'')}}). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This [[function field analogy]] can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] concerning the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the [[Weil conjectures]] (proven in 1974 by [[Pierre Deligne]]).\n\n[[File:One5Root.svg|thumb|The fifth roots of unity form a [[regular pentagon]].]]\n[[Cyclotomic field]]s are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, where {{math|\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a primitive {{math|''n''}}-th [[root of unity]], i.e., a complex number satisfying {{math|1={{nowrap begin}}\u03b6<sup>''n''</sup> = 1{{nowrap end}}}} and {{math|\u03b6<sup>''m''</sup> \u2260 1}} for all {{math|''m'' < ''n''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Washington|1997}}</ref> For {{math|''n''}} being a [[regular prime]], [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] used cyclotomic fields to prove [[Fermat's last theorem]], which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''y''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''z''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nLocal fields are completions of global fields. [[Ostrowski's theorem]] asserts that the only completions of {{math|'''Q'''}}, a global field, are the local fields {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''R'''}}. Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the [[local-global principle]]. For example, the [[Hasse\u2013Minkowski theorem]] reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, whose solutions can easily be described.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1978|loc=Chapter IV}}</ref>\n\nUnlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. [[Inverse Galois theory]] studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group {{math|Gal(''F''/'''Q''')}} for some number field {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1992}}</ref> [[Class field theory]] describes the [[abelian extension]]s, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]], describes the maximal abelian {{math|'''Q'''<sup>ab</sup>}} extension of {{math|'''Q'''}}: it is the field\n:{{math|'''Q'''(&zeta;<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n'' &ge; 2)}}\nobtained by adjoining all primitive {{math|''n''}}-th roots of unity. [[Kronecker Jugendtraum|Kronecker's Jugendtraum]] asks for a similarly explicit description of {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} of general number fields {{math|''F''}}. For [[imaginary quadratic field]]s, <math>F=\\mathbf Q(\\sqrt{-d})</math>, {{math|''d'' > 0}}, the theory of [[complex multiplication]] describes {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} using [[elliptic curves]]. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.\n\n==Related notions==\n\nIn addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field 0 &ne; 1, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of [[field with one element]], which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, as {{math|''p''}} tends to 1.<ref>{{harvtxt|Tits|1957}}</ref> In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as [[quasifield]]s, [[Near-field (mathematics)|near-field]]s and [[semifield]]s.\n\nThere are also [[proper class]]es with field structure, which are sometimes called '''Fields''', with a capital F. The [[surreal number]]s form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The [[nimber]]s, a concept from [[game theory]], form such a Field as well.<ref>{{harvtxt|Conway|1976}}</ref>\n\n===Division rings===\n[[File:Hairy_ball.png|thumb|The hairy ball theorem states that a ball cannot be combed. More formally, there is no [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[tangent bundle|tangent vector field]] on the [[sphere]] {{math|S<sup>2</sup>}}, which is everywhere non-zero.]]\n\nDropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a ''[[division ring]]'' or ''skew field''.<ref group=nb>Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called ''commutative fields''.</ref> The only division rings that are finite-dimensional {{math|'''R'''}}-vector spaces are {{math|'''R'''}} itself, {{math|'''C'''}} (which is a field), the [[quaternion]]s {{math|'''H'''}} (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the [[octonion]]s {{math|'''O'''}} (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative).

A field is thus a fundamental [[algebraic structure]] which is widely used in [[algebra]], [[number theory]], and many other areas of mathematics.\n\nThe best known fields are the field of [[rational number]]s, the field of [[real number]]s and the field of [[complex number]]s. Many other fields, such as [[field of rational functions|fields of rational functions]], [[algebraic function field]]s, [[algebraic number field]]s, and [[p-adic number|''p''-adic fields]] are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and [[algebraic geometry]]. Most [[cryptographic protocol]]s rely on [[finite field]]s, i.e., fields with finitely many [[element (set)|elements]].\n\nThe relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a [[field extension]]. [[Galois theory]], initiated by [[\u00c9variste Galois]] in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that [[angle trisection]] and [[squaring the circle]] cannot be done with a [[compass and straightedge]]. Moreover, it shows that [[quintic equation]]s are algebraically unsolvable.\n\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of [[mathematical analysis]], which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] for a [[vector space]], which is the standard general context for [[linear algebra]]. [[Number field]]s, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in [[number theory]]. [[Function field of an algebraic variety|Function fields]] can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\n== Definition ==\nInformally, a field is a set, along with two [[binary operation|operation]]s defined on that set: an addition operation written as {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}, and a multiplication operation written as {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}, both of which behave similarly as they behave for [[rational number]]s and [[real number]]s, including the existence of an [[additive inverse]] {{math|&minus;''a''}} for all elements {{mvar|a}}, and of a [[multiplicative inverse]] {{math|''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}} for every nonzero element {{mvar|b}}. This allows one to also consider the so-called ''inverse'' operations of [[Subtraction#Real numbers|subtraction]], {{math|''a'' &minus; ''b''}}, and [[Division (mathematics)|division]], {{math|''a'' / ''b''}}, by defining:\n:{{math|1=''a'' &minus; ''b'' = ''a'' + (&minus;''b'')}},\n:{{math|1=''a'' / ''b'' = ''a'' \u00b7 ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.\n\n===Classic definition===\n\nFormally, a field is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''F''}} together with two [[binary operation|operations]] on {{mvar|F}} called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=Definition 4.1.1, p.&nbsp;181}}</ref> An operation on {{mvar|F}} is a function {{math|''F'' &times; ''F'' &rarr; ''F''}} &ndash; in other words, a mapping that associates an element of {{mvar|F}} to every pair of its elements. The result of the addition of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the sum of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the product of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''ab''}} or {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}. These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as ''[[Axiom#Non-logical axioms|field axioms]]''. In these axioms,  {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are arbitrary [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the field {{mvar|F}}.\n\n* [[Associativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}},  and  {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' \u00b7 ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') \u00b7 ''c''}}.\n* [[Commutativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}}, and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''b'' = ''b'' \u00b7 ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive identity|Additive]] and [[multiplicative identity]]: there exist two different elements {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} in {{math|''F''}} such that {{math|1=''a'' + 0 = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 1 = ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted {{math|\u2212''a''}}, called the ''additive inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' + (\u2212''a'') = 0}}.\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted by {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} or {{math|1/''a''}}, called the ''multiplicative inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> = 1}}.\n* [[Distributivity]] of multiplication over addition: {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') + (''a'' \u00b7 ''c'')}}.\n\nThis may be summarized by saying: a field has two operations, called addition and multiplication; it is an [[abelian group]] under addition with 0 as the additive identity; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under multiplication with 1 as the multiplicative identity; and multiplication distributes over addition.\n\n===Alternative definition===\nFields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and their required properties. [[Division by zero]] is, by definition, excluded.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clark|1984|loc=Chapter 3}}.</ref> In order to avoid [[existential quantifier]]s, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses respectively), and two [[arity#Nullary|nullary]] operations (the constants {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[computing]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Mines|Richman|Ruitenburg|1988|loc=\u00a7II.2}}.

The additive inverse of such a fraction is {{math|\u2212''a''/''b''}}, and the multiplicative inverse (provided that {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}) is {{math|''b''/''a''}}, which can be seen as follows:\n\n: <math> \\frac b a \\cdot \\frac a b  = \\frac{ba}{ab} = 1.</math>\n\nThe abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac a b \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d + \\frac e f \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b  \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d  \\cdot \\frac f f + \\frac e f \\cdot \\frac d d \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{cf}{df} + \\frac{ed}{fd}\\right) = \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{cf + ed}{df} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a(cf + ed)}{bdf} = \\frac{acf}{bdf} +  \\frac{aed}{bdf} = \\frac{ac}{bd} +  \\frac{ae}{bf} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac c d + \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac e f.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Real and complex numbers===\n\n[[File:Complex_multi.svg|thumb|255px|The multiplication of complex numbers can be visualized geometrically by rotations and scalings.]]\n\n{{main|Real number| Complex number}}\nThe [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}} consist of expressions\n:{{math|''a'' + ''bi'',}} with {{math|''a'', ''b''}} real,\nwhere {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}.\nAddition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for {{math|'''C'''}}. For example, the distributive law enforces\n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''bi'')(''c'' + ''di'') = ''ac'' + ''bci'' + ''adi'' + ''bdi''<sup>2</sup> = ''ac''\u2212''bd'' + (''bc'' + ''ad'')''i''.}}\nIt is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], with [[Cartesian coordinates]] given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is &ndash;less intuitively&ndash; combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.\n\n===Constructible numbers===\n[[File:Root_construction_geometric_mean5.svg|thumb|255px|The [[geometric mean theorem]] asserts that {{math|1=''h''<sup>2</sup> = ''pq''}}. Choosing {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1}} allows construction of the square root of a given constructible number {{math|''p''}}.]]\n{{main|Constructible numbers}}\n \nIn antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with [[compass and straightedge]]. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle in this way. These problems can be settled using the field of [[constructible numbers]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Chapter 13.4}}</ref> Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only [[compass]] and [[straightedge]]. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field {{math|'''Q'''}} of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of [[square root]]s of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within {{math|'''Q'''}}. Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments {{math|''AB''}}, {{math|''BD''}}, and a [[semicircle]] over {{math|''AD''}} (center at the [[midpoint]] {{math|''C''}}), which intersects the [[perpendicular]] line through {{math|''B''}} in a point {{math|''F''}}, at a distance of exactly <math>h=\\sqrt p</math> from {{math|''B''}} when {{math|''BD''}} has length one.\n\nNot all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that <math>\\sqrt[3] 2</math> is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a [[Doubling the cube|cube with volume 2]], another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.\n\n===A field with four elements===\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center;\"| Addition\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center'\"| Multiplication\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| + !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|}\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| \u00b7 !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|}\n|}\n\nIn addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called {{math|''O''}}, {{math|''I''}}, {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''B''}}. The notation is chosen such that {{math|''O''}} plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,\n\n: {{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 (''B'' + ''A'') = ''A'' \u00b7 ''I'' = ''A''}}, which equals {{nowrap|1={{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 ''B'' + ''A'' \u00b7 ''A'' = ''I'' + ''B'' = ''A''}}}}, as required by the distributivity.\n\nThis field is called a [[finite field]] with four elements, and is denoted {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} or {{math|GF(4)}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Example 1.62}}</ref> The subset consisting of {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the ''[[binary field]]'' {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} or {{math|GF(2)}}. In the context of [[computer science]] and [[Boolean algebra]], {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} are often denoted respectively by ''false'' and ''true'', the addition is then denoted [[XOR]] (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted [[Bitwise AND|AND]]. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with [[bit]]s.\n\n==Elementary notions==\nIn this section, {{math|''F''}} denotes an arbitrary field and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary [[element (set theory)|elements]] of {{math|''F''}}.\n\n===Consequences of the definition===\nOne has {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 0 = 0}} and {{math|1=\u2212''a'' = (\u22121) \u00b7 ''a''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref> In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows {{math|\u20131}}.\n\nIf {{math|1=''ab'' = 0}} then {{math|1=''a''}} or {{math|''b''}} must be 0. Indeed, if ''a''&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;0, then \n{{math|1=0 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>\u22c50 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>(''ab'') = (''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>''a'')''b'' = ''b''}}. This means that every field is an [[integral domain]].\n\n===The additive and the multiplicative group of a field===\nThe axioms of a field {{math|''F''}} imply that it is an [[abelian group]] under addition. This group is called the [[additive group]] of the field, and is sometimes denoted by {{math|(''F'', +)}} when denoting it simply as {{math|''F''}} could be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, the ''nonzero'' elements of {{math|''F''}} form an abelian group under multiplication, called the [[multiplicative group]], and denoted by {{math|(''F'' \\ {0}, \u00b7)}} or just {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} or {{math|''F''<sup>*</sup>}}. \n\nA field may thus be defined as set {{math|''F''}} equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that {{math|''F''}} is an abelian group under addition, {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] over addition.<ref group=nb>Equivalently, a field is an [[algebraic structure]] {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u00b7, \u2212, <sup>\u22121</sup>, 0, 1\u27e9}} of type {{math|\u27e82, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0\u27e9}}, such that {{math|0<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is not defined, {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u2013, 0\u27e9}} and \n{{math|\u27e8''F'' \u2216 {0}, \u00b7, <sup>\u22121</sup>\u27e9}} are abelian groups, and \n\u00b7 is distributive over +. {{harvtxt|Wallace|1998|loc=Th. 2}}</ref> Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses {{math|\u2212''a''}} and {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} are uniquely determined by {{math|''a''}}.\n\nThe requirement {{math|1 \u2260 0}} follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Sharpe|1987|loc=Theorem 1.3.2}}</ref> Thus, the [[trivial ring]], consisting of a single element, is not a field.\n\nEvery finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is [[cyclic group|cyclic]] (see {{slink|Root of unity|Cyclic groups}}).\n\n===Characteristic===\nIn addition to the multiplication of two elements of ''F'', it is possible to define the product {{math|''n'' \u22c5 ''a''}} of an arbitrary element {{math|''a''}} of {{math|''F''}} by a positive [[integer]] {{math|''n''}} to be the {{math|''n''}}-fold sum\n:{{math|''a'' + ''a'' + ... + ''a''}} (which is an element of  {{math|''F''}}.)\n\nIf there is no positive integer such that\n:{{math|1=''n'' \u22c5 1 = 0}},\nthen {{math|''F''}} is said to have [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=\u00a7I.2, p.&nbsp;10}}</ref> For example, the field of rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} has characteristic 0 since no positive integer {{math|''n''}} is zero. Otherwise, if there ''is'' a positive integer {{math|''n''}} satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a [[prime number]]. It is usually denoted by {{math|''p''}} and the field is said to have characteristic {{math|''p''}} then.\nFor example, the field {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) {{math| 1= I + I = O }}.\n\nIf {{math|''F''}} has characteristic {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|1=''p'' \u22c5 ''a'' = 0}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}. This implies that \n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''b'')<sup>''p''</sup> = ''a''<sup>''p''</sup> + ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>}},\nsince all other [[binomial coefficient]]s appearing in the [[binomial formula]] are divisible by {{math|''p''}}.

Therefore, the [[Frobenius map]]\n:{{math|Fr: ''F'' &rarr; ''F'', ''x'' \u27fc ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>}}\nis compatible with the addition in {{math|''F''}} (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Escofier|2012|loc=14.4.2}}</ref> The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic {{math|''p''}} quite different from fields of characteristic 0.\n\n===Subfields and prime fields===\nA ''[[Field extension|subfield]]'' {{math|''E''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that is a field with respect to the field operations of {{math|''F''}}. Equivalently {{math|''E''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that contains {{math|1}}, and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that {{math|1 \u220a ''E''}}, that for all {{math|''a'', ''b'' \u220a ''E''}} both {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' \u00b7 ''b''}} are in {{math|''E''}}, and that for all {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''E''}}, both {{math|\u2013''a''}} and {{math|1/''a''}} are in {{math|''E''}}.\n\n[[Field homomorphism]]s are maps {{math|''f'': ''E'' &rarr; ''F''}} between two fields such that {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub> + ''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>) + ''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>)''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, and {{math|1=''f''(1<sub>E</sub>) = 1<sub>F</sub>}}, where {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''e''<sub>2</sub>}} are arbitrary elements of {{math|''E''}}.

Any field {{math|''F''}} contains a prime field. If the characteristic of {{math|''F''}} is {{math|''p''}} (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} introduced below. Otherwise the prime field is isomorphic to {{math|'''Q'''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=p. 12}}</ref>\n\n==Finite fields==\n{{main|Finite field}}\n''Finite fields'' (also called ''Galois fields'') are fields with finitely many elements, whose number is also referred to as the order of the field. The above introductory example {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} is a field with four elements.

However, {{math|'''Z'''/12'''Z'''}} is not a field because 12 is not a prime number.]]\nThe simplest finite fields, with prime order, are most directly accessible using [[modular arithmetic]]. For a fixed positive integer {{math|''n''}}, arithmetic \"modulo {{math|''n''}}\" means to work with the numbers\n:{{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' = {0, 1, ..., ''n'' \u2212 1}.}}\nThe addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, dividing by {{math|''n''}} and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if {{math|''n''}} is a [[prime number]]. For example, taking the prime {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2}} results in the above-mentioned field {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}. For {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}} and more generally, for any [[composite number]] (i.e., any number {{math|''n''}} which can be expressed as a product {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r''\u22c5''s''}} of two strictly smaller natural numbers), {{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since {{math|1=''r''\u22c5''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}} in {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}, which, as was explained [[#Consequences of the definition|above]], prevents {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} from being a field. The field {{math|'''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}} with {{math|''p''}} elements ({{math|''p''}} being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by  {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\nEvery finite field {{math|''F''}} has {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements, where {{math|1=''p''}} is prime and {{math|''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;1}}. This statement holds since {{math|''F''}} may be viewed as a [[vector space]] over its prime field. The [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of this vector space is necessarily finite, say {{math|''n''}}, which implies the asserted statement.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Lemma 2.1, Theorem 2.2}}</ref>\n\nA field with {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements can be constructed as the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial \n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>''q''</sup> &minus; ''x''}}.\nSuch a splitting field is an extension of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} in which the polynomial {{math|''f''}} has {{math|''q''}} zeros. This means {{math|''f''}} has as many zeros as possible since the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|''q''}}. For {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}}, it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} satisfy the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''}}, so they are zeros of {{math|''f''}}. By contrast, in {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{math|''f''}} has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so {{math|''f''}} does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Theorem 1.2.5}}</ref> It is thus customary to speak of ''the'' finite field with {{math|''q''}} elements, denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} or {{math|GF(''q'')}}.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 63}}</ref> A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who observed that permuting the zeros {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>}} of a [[cubic polynomial]] in the expression\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub> + &omega;''x''<sub>2</sub> + &omega;<sup>2</sup>''x''<sub>3</sub>)<sup>3</sup>}}\n(with {{math|&omega;}} being a third [[root of unity]]) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te]], which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown {{math|''x''}} to an quadratic equation for {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kiernan|1971|loc=p. 50}}</ref> Together with a similar observation for [[quartic polynomial|equations of degree 4]], Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=pp. 75\u201376}}</ref> [[Alexandre-Th\u00e9ophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]], also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1801), studied the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''p''</sup> = 1}}\nfor a prime {{math|''p''}} and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic [[Galois group]]. Gauss deduced that a [[regular polygon|regular {{math|''p''}}-gon]] can be constructed if {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2<sup>''k''</sup></sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}}. Building on Lagrange's work, [[Paolo Ruffini]] claimed (1799) that [[quintic equation]]s (polynomial equations of degree 5) cannot be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by [[Niels Henrik Abel]] in 1824.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p.24}}</ref> [[\u00c9variste Galois]], in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as [[Galois theory]] today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an [[algebraic number field]], but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.\n\nIn 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the [[German (language)|German]] word ''K\u00f6rper'', which means \"body\" or \"corpus\" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term \"field\" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Moore|1893}}.<ref>[http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html ''Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (F)'']</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=By a field we will mean every infinite system of real or complex numbers so closed in itself and perfect that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two of these numbers again yields a number of the system.\n|author=Richard Dedekind, 1871<ref>{{harvtxt|Dirichlet|1871|loc=p. 42}}, translation by {{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 66}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1881 [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a ''domain of rationality'', which is a field of [[rational fraction]]s in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as {{math|'''Q'''(&pi;)}} abstractly as the rational function field {{math|'''Q'''(''X'')}}. Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since [[Joseph Liouville]]'s work in 1844, until [[Charles Hermite]] (1873) and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] (1882) proved the transcendence of {{math|''e''}} and {{math|&pi;}}, respectively.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 81}}</ref>\n\nThe first clear definition of an abstract field is due to {{harvtxt|Weber|1893}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p. 33}}. See also {{harvtxt|Fricke|Weber|1924}}.</ref> In particular, [[Heinrich Martin Weber]]'s notion included the field '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>. [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led {{harvtxt|Hensel|1904}} to introduce the field of ''p''-adic numbers. {{harvtxt|Steinitz|1910}} synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections [[#Galois theory|Galois theory]], [[#Constructing fields|Constructing fields]] and [[#Elementary notions|Elementary notions]] can be found in Steinitz's work. {{harvtxt|Artin|Schreier|1927}} linked the notion of [[ordered field|orderings in a field]], and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 92}}</ref> [[Emil Artin]] redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the [[primitive element theorem]].\n\n==Constructing fields==\n\n===Constructing fields from rings===\nA [[commutative ring]] is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses {{math|''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7II.1}}</ref> For example, the integers {{math|'''Z'''}} form a commutative ring, but not a field: the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of an integer {{math|''n''}} is not itself an integer, unless {{math|1=''n'' = \u00b11}}.\n\nIn the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings {{math|''R''}} in which every nonzero element is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (which means every element is invertible).

Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which {{math|(0)}} is the only [[prime ideal]].\n\nGiven a commutative ring {{math|''R''}}, there are two ways to construct a field related to {{math|''R''}}, i.e., two ways of modifying {{math|''R''}} such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of {{math|'''Z'''}} is {{math|'''Q'''}}, the rationals, while the residue fields of {{math|'''Z'''}} are the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\n====Field of fractions====\n\nGiven an [[integral domain]] {{math|''R''}}, its [[field of fractions]] {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} is built with the fractions of two elements of {{math|''R''}} exactly as '''Q''' is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} are the fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}  are in {{math|''R''}}, and  {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. Two fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} and  {{math|''c''/''d''}} are equal if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, \n:<math>\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.</math>\nIt is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 10.6}}</ref>\n\nThe field {{math|''F''(''x'')}} of the [[rational fraction]]s over a field (or an integral domain) {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''F''[''x'']}}. The field {{math|''F''((''x''))}} of [[Laurent series]]\n:<math>\\sum_{i=k}^\\infty a_i x^i \\ (k \\in \\Z, a_i \\in F)</math>\nover a field {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the ring {{math|''F''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''x'']]}} of [[formal power series]] (in which {{math|''k'' &ge; 0}}). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of {{math|''x''}} (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.\n\n====Residue fields====\nIn addition to the field of fractions, which embeds {{math|''R''}} [[injective map|injectively]] into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring {{math|''R''}} by means of a [[surjective map]] onto a field {{math|''F''}}. Any field obtained in this way is a [[quotient ring|quotient]] {{math|{{nowrap|''R'' / ''m''}}}}, where {{math|''m''}} is a [[maximal ideal]] of {{math|''R''}}. If {{math|''R''}} [[local ring|has only one maximal ideal]] {{math|''m''}}, this field is called the [[residue field]] of {{math|''R''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=p. 60}}</ref>\n\nThe [[principal ideal|ideal generated by a single polynomial]] {{math|''f''}} in the polynomial ring {{math|1=''R'' = ''E''[''X'']}} (over a field {{math|''E''}}) is maximal if and only if {{math|''f''}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] in {{math|''E''}}, i.e., if {{math|''f''}} cannot be expressed as the product of two polynomials in {{math|''E''[''X'']}} of smaller [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]. This yields a field\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / (''f''(''X'')).}}\nThis field {{math|''F''}} contains an element {{math|''x''}} (namely the [[residue class]] of {{math|''X''}}) which satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 0}}.\nFor example, {{math|'''C'''}} is obtained from {{math|'''R'''}} by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] the [[imaginary unit]] symbol {{mvar|i}}, which satisfies {{math|1=''f''(''i'') = 0}}, where {{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}}. Moreover, {{math|''f''}} is irreducible over {{math|'''R'''}}, which implies that the map that sends a polynomial {{math|''f''(''X'') \u220a '''R'''[''X'']}} to {{math|''f''(''i'')}} yields an isomorphism\n:<math>\\mathbf R[X]/\\left(X^2 + 1\\right) \\ \\stackrel \\cong \\longrightarrow \\ \\mathbf C.</math>\n\n===Constructing fields within a bigger field===\nFields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field {{math|''E''}}, and a field {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} as a subfield. For any element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''F''}}, there is a smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''x''}}, called the subfield of ''F'' generated by {{math|''x''}} and denoted {{math|''E''(''x'')}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|loc=p. 213}}</ref> The passage from {{math|''E''}} to {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is referred to by ''[[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element'' to {{math|''E''}}. More generally, for a subset {{math|''S'' \u2282 ''F''}}, there is a minimal subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''S''}}, denoted by {{math|''E''(''S'')}}.\n\nThe [[compositum]] of two subfields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E' ''}} of some field {{math|''F''}} is the smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing both {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E'.''}} The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}} satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}}, which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over {{math|''E''}}.<ref group=nb>Further examples include the maximal [[unramified extension]] or the maximal [[abelian extension]] within {{math|''F''}}.</ref>\n\n===Field extensions===\n{{See|Glossary of field theory}}\nThe notion of a subfield {{math|''E'' \u2282 ''F''}} can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to {{math|''F''}} being a ''[[field extension]]'' (or just extension) of {{math|''E''}}, denoted by\n:{{math|''F'' / ''E''}},\nand read \"{{math|''F''}} over {{math|''E''}}\".\n\nA basic datum of a field extension is its [[degree of a field extension|degree]] {{math|[''F'' : ''E'']}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''F''}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space. It satisfies the formula<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Theorem 13.3.4}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=[''G'' : ''E''] = [''G'' : ''F''] [''F'' : ''E'']}}.\nExtensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions {{math|'''C''' / '''R'''}} and {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub> / '''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} are of degree 2, whereas {{math|'''R''' / '''Q'''}} is an infinite extension.\n\n====Algebraic extensions====\nA pivotal notion in the study of field extensions {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} are [[algebraic element]]s. An element {{tmath|x\\in F}} is ''algebraic'' over {{mvar|E}} if it is a [[zero of a function|root]] of a [[polynomial]] with coefficients in {{mvar|E}}, that is, if it satisfies a [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''e''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''e''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''e''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''e''<sub>0</sub> = 0}},\nwith {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>0</sub>}} in {{mvar|E}}, and {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub> &ne; 0}}. \nFor example, the [[imaginary unit]] {{math|''i''}} in  {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraic over {{math|'''R'''}}, and even over {{math|'''Q'''}}, since it satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}.\nA field extension in which every element of {{math|''F''}} is algebraic over {{math|''E''}} is called an [[algebraic extension]]. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Corollary 13.3.6}}</ref>\n\nThe subfield {{math|''E''(''x'')}} generated by an element {{math|''x''}}, as above, is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} if and only if {{math|''x''}} is an algebraic element. That is to say, if {{math|''x''}} is algebraic, all other elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, equals the minimal degree {{math|''n''}} such that there is a polynomial equation involving {{math|''x''}}, as above. If this degree is {{math|''n''}}, then the elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} have the form \n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k, \\ \\ a_k \\in E.</math>\n\nFor example, the field {{math|'''Q'''(''i'')}} of [[Gaussian rational]]s is the subfield of {{math|'''C'''}} consisting of all numbers of the form {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are rational numbers: summands of the form {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup>}} (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since {{math|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''ci''<sup>2</sup>}} can be simplified to {{math|''a'' &minus; ''c'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n====Transcendence bases====\nThe above-mentioned field of [[rational fraction]]s {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, where {{math|''X''}} is an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]], is not an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in {{math|''E''}} whose zero is {{math|''X''}}. Elements, such as {{math|''X''}}, which are not algebraic are called [[Algebraic element|transcendental]]. Informally speaking, the indeterminate {{math|''X''}} and its powers do not interact with elements of {{math|''E''}}. A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.\n\nOnce again, the field extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}} discussed above is a key example: if {{math|''x''}} is not algebraic (i.e., {{math|''x''}} is not a [[root of a function|root]] of a polynomial with coefficients in {{math|''E''}}), then {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}. This isomorphism is obtained by substituting {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''X''}} in rational fractions.\n\nA subset {{math|''S''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a [[transcendence basis]] if it is [[algebraically independent]] (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over {{math|''E''}} and if {{math|''F''}} is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''(''S'')}}. Any field extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} has a transcendence basis.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter V, \u00a714, No. 2, Theorem 1}}</ref> Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form {{math|''E''(''S'') / ''E''}} ([[transcendental extension|purely transcendental extensions]]) and algebraic extensions.\n\n===Closure operations===\nA field is [[algebraically closed]] if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''f''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''f''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''f''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0}}, with [[coefficient]]s {{math|''f''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>0</sub> \u2208 ''F'', ''n'' > 0}},\nhas a solution {{math|''x'' \u220a ''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 13.9}}</ref> By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, i.e., ''any'' polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are ''not'' algebraically closed since the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}\ndoes not have any rational or real solution. A field containing {{math|''F''}} is called an ''[[algebraic closure]]'' of {{math|''F''}} if it is [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] over {{math|''F''}} (roughly speaking, not too big compared to {{math|''F''}}) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).\n\nBy the above, {{math|'''C'''}} is an algebraic closure of {{math|'''R'''}}. The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field {{math|''F''}} is quite special: by the [[Artin-Schreier theorem]], the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and {{math|''F''}} is [[elementarily equivalent]] to {{math|'''R'''}}. Such fields are also known as [[real closed field]]s.\n\nAny field {{math|''F''}} has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as ''the'' algebraic closure and denoted {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}}. For example, the algebraic closure {{math|{{Overline|'''Q'''}}}} of {{math|'''Q'''}} is called the field of [[algebraic number]]s. The field {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}} is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the [[ultrafilter lemma]], a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Banaschewski|1992}}. [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46566/is-the-statement-that-every-field-has-an-algebraic-closure-known-to-be-equivalent Mathoverflow post]</ref> In this regard, the algebraic closure of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}}, is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (the ones of order {{math|''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}}). For any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field {{math|''F''((''t''))}} of [[Laurent series]] is the field of [[Puiseux series]], obtained by adjoining roots of {{math|''t''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ribenboim|1999|loc=p. 186, \u00a77.1}}</ref>\n\n==Fields with additional structure==\nSince fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.\n\n===Ordered fields===\n{{main|Ordered field}}\nA field ''F'' is called an ''ordered field'' if any two elements can be compared, so that {{math|''x'' + ''y'' \u2265 0}} and {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} whenever {{math|''x''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} and {{math|''y''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}}. For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering&nbsp;{{math|\u2265}}. The [[Artin-Schreier theorem]] states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a [[formally real field]], which means that any quadratic equation\n:<math>x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 = 0</math>\nonly has the solution {{math|1=''x''<sub>1</sub> = ''x''<sub>2</sub> = ... = ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter VI, \u00a72.3, Corollary 1}}</ref> The set of all possible orders on a fixed field {{math|''F''}} is isomorphic to the set of [[ring homomorphism]]s from the [[Witt ring (forms)|Witt ring]] {{math|W(''F'')}} of [[quadratic form]]s over {{math|''F''}}, to {{math|'''Z'''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lorenz|2008|loc=\u00a722, Theorem 1}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Archimedean field]] is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression\n:{{math|1 + 1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1}}\nwhose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements.  Equivalently, the field contains no [[infinitesimals]] (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|Each bounded real set has a least upper bound.]]\nAn ordered field is [[Dedekind-complete]] if all [[upper bound]]s, [[lower bound]]s (see [[Dedekind cut]]) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each [[bounded set|bounded subset]] of {{math|''F''}} is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean,<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Proposition 1.22}}</ref> since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence {{math|1/2, 1/3, 1/4, &hellip;}}, every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.\n\nSince every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, {{math|'''R'''}} is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Theorem 1.23}}</ref> Several foundational results in [[calculus]] follow directly from this characterization of the reals.\n\nThe [[hyperreals]] {{math|'''R'''<sup>*</sup>}} form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of [[non-standard analysis]].\n\n===Topological fields===\nAnother refinement of the notion of a field is a [[topological field]], in which the set {{math|''F''}} is a [[topological space]], such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps {{math|''a'' \u21a6 &minus;''a''}} and {{math|''a'' \u21a6 ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}) are [[continuous map]]s with respect to the topology of the space.<ref>{{harvtxt|Warner|1989|loc=Chapter 14}}</ref>\nThe topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], i.e., a function\n:{{math|''d'' : ''F'' \u00d7 ''F'' \u2192 '''R''',}}\nthat measures a ''distance'' between any two elements of {{math|''F''}}.\n\nThe [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of {{math|''F''}} is another field in which, informally speaking, the \"gaps\" in the original field {{math|''F''}} are filled, if there are any. For example, any [[irrational number]] {{math|''x''}}, such as {{math|1=''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{radic|2}}}}, is a \"gap\" in the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers {{math|''p''/''q''}}, in the sense that distance of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p''/''q''}} given by the [[absolute value]] {{math|{{!}} ''x'' \u2013 ''p''/''q'' {{!}}}} is as small as desired.\nThe following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero [[sequence]], i.e., a sequence whose limit (for {{math|''n''&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;\u221e}}) is zero.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Field !! Metric !! Completion !! zero sequence\n|-\n| {{math|'''Q'''}} || {{math|<nowiki>|</nowiki> ''x'' \u2013 ''y'' <nowiki>|</nowiki>}} (usual [[absolute value]]) || '''R''' || {{math|1/''n''}}\n|-\n| {{math|'''Q'''}} \n|| obtained using the [[p-adic valuation|''p''-adic valuation]], for a prime number {{math|''p''}}\n|| {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} ([[p-adic number|{{math|''p''}}-adic numbers]])\n|| {{math|''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}}\n|-\n| {{math|''F''(''t'')}}<br/> ({{math|''F''}} any field)\n|| obtained using the {{math|''t''}}-adic valuation\n|| {{math|''F''((''t''))}}\n|| {{math|''t''<sup>''n''</sup>}}\n|}\n\nThe field {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is used in number theory and [[p-adic analysis|{{math|''p''}}-adic analysis]]. The algebraic closure {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} carries a unique norm extending the one on {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is sometimes called the field of [[p-adic number|Metric completions and algebraic closures|complex p-adic number]]s and is denoted by {{math|'''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|1997|loc=\u00a75.7}}</ref>\n\n====Local fields====\nThe following topological fields are called ''[[local field]]s'':<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1979}}</ref><ref group=nb>Some authors also consider the fields {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} to be local fields. On the other hand, these two fields, also called Archimedean local fields, share little similarity with the local fields considered here, to a point that {{harvtxt|Cassels|1986|loc=p. vi}} calls them \"completely anomalous\".</ref>\n* finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} (local fields of characteristic zero)\n* finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, the field of Laurent series over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} (local fields of characteristic {{math|''p''}}).\n\nThese two types of local fields share some fundamental similarities. In this relation, the elements {{math|''p'' \u2208 '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|''t'' \u2208 '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}} (referred to as [[uniformizer]]) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}. (However, since the addition in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is done using [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]]ing, which is not the case in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:\n* Any [[first order logic|first order]] statement that is true for almost all {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is also true for almost all {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}. An application of this is the [[Ax-Kochen theorem]] describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n* [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|Tamely ramified extension]]s of both fields are in bijection to one another.\n* Adjoining arbitrary {{math|''p''}}-power roots of {{math|''p''}} (in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}), respectively of {{math|''t''}} (in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as [[perfectoid field]]s. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields:<ref>{{harvtxt|Scholze|2014}}</ref>\n::<math>\\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf Q_p\\left(p^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right) \\cong \\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf F_p((t))\\left(t^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right).</math>\n\n===Differential fields===\n[[Differential field]]s are fields equipped with a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field.<ref>{{harvtxt|van der Put|Singer|2003|loc=\u00a71}}</ref> For example, the field '''R'''(''X''), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to [[differential Galois theory]], a variant of Galois theory dealing with [[linear differential equation]]s.\n\n==Galois theory==\n{{main|Galois theory}}\n\nGalois theory studies [[algebraic extension]]s of a field by studying the [[Symmetry group#Symmetry groups in general|symmetry]] in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are [[finite extension|finite]] [[Galois extension]]s {{math|''F'' / ''E''}}, which are, by definition, those that are [[separable extension|separable]] and [[normal extension|normal]]. The [[primitive element theorem]] shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily [[simple extension|simple]], i.e., of the form\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / ''f''(''X'')}},\nwhere {{math|''f''}} is an irreducible polynomial (as above).<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Theorem V.4.6}}</ref> For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of {{math|''f''}} are contained in {{math|''F''}} and that {{math|''f''}} has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if {{math|''E''}} has characteristic 0.\n\nFor a finite Galois extension, the [[Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} is the group of [[field automorphism]]s of {{math|''F''}} that are trivial on {{math|''E''}} (i.e., the [[bijection]]s {{math|\u03c3 : ''F'' \u2192 ''F''}} that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of {{math|''E''}} to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], which constructs an explicit [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the set of [[subgroup]]s of {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension {{math|''F''/''E''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7VI.1}}</ref> By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not [[solvable group|solvable]] (cannot be built from [[abelian group]]s), then the zeros of {{math|''f''}} ''cannot'' be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving <math>\\sqrt[n]{\\ }</math>. For example, the [[symmetric group]]s {{math|S<sub>''n''</sub>}} is not solvable for {{math|''n''&ge;5}}. Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]:\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>5</sup> &minus; 4''X'' + 2}} (and {{math|1=''E'' = '''Q'''}}),<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Example VI.2.6}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>''X''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} (where {{math|''f''}} is regarded as a polynomial in {{math|''E''(''a''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>)}}, for some indeterminates {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, {{math|''E''}} is any field, and {{math|''n'' &ge; 5}}).\n\nThe [[tensor product of fields]] is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} of degree {{math|''n''}} is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of {{math|''F''}}-algebras\n:{{math|''F''  \u2297<sub>''E''</sub> ''F'' \u2245 ''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\nThis fact is the beginning of [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.<ref>{{harvtxt|Borceux|Janelidze|2001}}. See also [[\u00c9tale fundamental group]].</ref>\n\n==Invariants of fields==\n\nBasic invariants of a field {{math|''F''}} include the characteristic and the [[transcendence degree]] of {{math|''F''}} over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in {{math|''F''}} that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|2012|loc=Theorem 6.4.8}}</ref> This implies that any two [[uncountable]] algebraically closed fields of the same [[cardinality]] and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>, '''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''C'''}} are isomorphic (but ''not'' isomorphic as topological fields).\n\n===Model theory of fields===\nIn [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], two fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called [[elementarily equivalent]] if every mathematical statement that is true for {{math|''E''}} is also true for {{math|''F''}} and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is\n:{{math|&phi;(''E'')}} = \"for any {{math|''n'' > 0}}, any polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''E''}} has a zero in {{math|''E''}}\" (which amounts to saying that {{math|''E''}} is algebraically closed).\nThe [[Lefschetz principle]] states that {{math|'''C'''}} is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement {{math|&phi;}} holds in {{math|'''C'''}} if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Marker|Messmer|Pillay|2006|loc=Corollary 1.2}}</ref>\n\nIf {{math|''U''}} is an [[ultrafilter]] on a set {{math|''I''}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a field for every {{math|''i''}} in {{math|''I''}}, the [[ultraproduct]] of the {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''U''}} is a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Schoutens|2002|loc=\u00a72}}</ref> It is denoted by\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''i''&rarr;\u221e</sub> ''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}},\nsince it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}: [[\u0141o\u015b's theorem]] states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence {{math|&phi;}}, this shows that there is an isomorphism<ref group=nb>Both {{math|'''C'''}} and {{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> {{overline|'''F'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} are algebraically closed by \u0141o\u015b's theorem. For the same reason, they both have characteristic zero. Finally, they are both uncountable, so that they are isomorphic.</ref>\n:<math>\\operatorname{ulim}_{p \\to \\infty} \\overline \\mathbf F_p \\cong \\mathbf C.</math>\nThe Ax\u2013Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes {{math|''p''}})\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> \u2245 ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}.\nIn addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as [[real closed field]]s or [[exponential field]]s (which are equipped with an exponential function  {{math|exp : ''F'' &rarr; ''F''<sup>x</sup>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Kuhlmann|2000}}</ref>\n\n===The absolute Galois group===\nFor fields that are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the [[absolute Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F'')}} is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs ''all'' finite separable extensions of {{math|''F''}}. By elementary means, the group {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} can be shown to be the [[Pr\u00fcfer group]], the [[profinite completion]] of {{math|'''Z'''}}. This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} are the fields {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub>)}} for {{math|''n'' > 0}}, and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by\n:{{math|1=Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub> / '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) = '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}.\nA description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of {{math|''p''}}-adic number fields (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Jannsen|Wingberg|1982}}</ref>\n\n[[Galois representation|Representations of Galois groups]] and of related groups such as the [[Weil group]] are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the [[Langlands program]]. The cohomological study of such representations is done using [[Galois cohomology]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|2002}}</ref> For example, the [[Brauer group]], which is classically defined as the group of [[central simple algebra|central simple {{math|''F''}}-algebras]], can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely\n:{{math|1=Br(''F'') = H<sup>2</sup>(''F'', '''G'''<sub>m</sub>)}}.\n\n===K-theory===\n[[Milnor K-theory]] is defined as\n:<math>K_n^M(F) = F^\\times \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes F^\\times / \\langle x \\otimes (1-x)\\mid x \\in F \\smallsetminus \\{0, 1\\} \\rangle.</math>\nThe [[norm residue isomorphism theorem]], proved around 2000 by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]], relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism\n:<math>K_n^M(F) / p = H^n(F, \\mu_l^{\\otimes n}).</math>\n[[Algebraic K-theory]] is related to the group of [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the [[determinant (mathematics)|determinant]] of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K<sub>1</sub>(''F'') = ''F''<sup>&times;</sup>. [[Matsumoto's theorem (K-theory)|Matsumoto's theorem]] shows that K<sub>2</sub>(''F'') agrees with K<sub>2</sub><sup>M</sup>(''F''). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Linear algebra and commutative algebra===\n[[File:euler2a.gif|thumb|[[Euler angles]] express the relation of different coordinate systems, i.e., bases of {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}. They are used in computer graphics.]]\nIf {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}, then the [[equation]] \n:{{math|1=''ax'' = ''b''}}\nhas a unique solution {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''F''}}, namely {{math|1=''x'' = ''b''/''a''}}. This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=\u00a73.3}}</ref> Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in [[linear algebra]] both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.\n\n[[module (mathematics)|Modules]] (the analogue of vector spaces) over most [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, including the ring {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring {{math|''R''}} is a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} in its own right. Such rings are called [[algebra over a field|{{math|''F''}}-algebras]] and are studied in depth in the area of [[commutative algebra]]. For example, [[Noether normalization]] asserts that any [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated {{math|''F''}}-algebra]] is closely related to (more precisely, [[finitely generated module|finitely generated as a module]] over) a polynomial ring {{math|''F''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>]}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Theorem 13.3}}</ref>\n\n===Finite fields: cryptography and coding theory===\n\n[[File:ECClines.svg|thumb|The sum of three points ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' on an elliptic curve ''E'' (red) is zero if there is a line (blue) passing through these points.]]\nA widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''a'' \u22c5 ''a'' \u22c5 ... \u22c5 ''a''}} ({{math|''n''}} factors, for an integer {{math|''n'' \u2265 1}})\nin a (large) finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} can be performed much more efficiently than the [[discrete logarithm]], which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution {{math|''n''}} to an equation\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''b''}}.\nIn [[elliptic curve cryptography]], the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an [[elliptic curve]], i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form\n:{{math|1=''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''}}.\n\nFinite fields are also used in [[coding theory]] and [[combinatorics]].\n\n===Geometry: field of functions===\n[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A compact Riemann surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] two (two handles). The genus can be read off the field of meromorphic functions on the surface.]]\n[[function (mathematics)|Functions]] on a suitable [[topological space]] {{math|''X''}} into a field {{mvar|k}} can be added and multiplied pointwise, e.g., the product of two functions is defined by the product of their values within the domain:\n:{{math|1={{nowrap|1=(''f'' \u22c5 ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u22c5 ''g''(''x'')}}}}.\nThis makes these functions a {{mvar|k}}-[[associative algebra|commutative algebra]].\n\nFor having a ''field'' of functions, one must consider algebras of functions that are [[integral domains]]. In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form\n:<math>\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)},</math>\nform a field, called field of functions.\n\nThis occurs in two main cases. When {{math|''X''}} is a [[complex manifold]] {{math|''X''}}. In this case, one considers the algebra of [[holomorphic functions]], i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of  [[meromorphic function]]s on {{math|''X''}}.\n\nThe [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of an [[algebraic variety]] {{math|''X''}} (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of [[regular function]]s, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[affine space|space]] over a field {{math|''k''}} is {{math|''k''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in {{math|''n''}} indeterminates. The function field of {{math|''X''}} is the same as the one of any [[Zariski topology|open]] dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing {{math|''X''}} by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.\n\nThe function field is invariant under [[isomorphism]] and [[birational equivalence]] of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of [[abstract algebraic variety|abstract algebraic varieties]] and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]], which equals the transcendence degree of {{math|''k''(''X'')}}, is invariant under birational equivalence.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=\u00a713, Theorem A}}</ref> For [[algebraic curve|curves]] (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field {{math|''k''(''X'')}} is very close to {{math|''X''}}: if {{math|''X''}} is [[smooth variety|smooth]] and [[proper map|proper]] (the analogue of being [[compact topological space|compact]]), {{math|''X''}} can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions.<ref group=nb>More precisely, there is an [[equivalence of categories]] between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} and finite field extensions of {{math|''F''(''T'')}}.</ref> In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about {{math|''X''}}. The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as [[birational geometry]]. The [[minimal model program]] attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.\n\n===Number theory: global fields===\n\n[[Global field]]s are in the limelight in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[arithmetic geometry]].\nThey are, by definition, [[number field]]s (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''}}) or function fields over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'')}}). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This [[function field analogy]] can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] concerning the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the [[Weil conjectures]] (proven in 1974 by [[Pierre Deligne]]).\n\n[[File:One5Root.svg|thumb|The fifth roots of unity form a [[regular pentagon]].]]\n[[Cyclotomic field]]s are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, where {{math|\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a primitive {{math|''n''}}-th [[root of unity]], i.e., a complex number satisfying {{math|1={{nowrap begin}}\u03b6<sup>''n''</sup> = 1{{nowrap end}}}} and {{math|\u03b6<sup>''m''</sup> \u2260 1}} for all {{math|''m'' < ''n''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Washington|1997}}</ref> For {{math|''n''}} being a [[regular prime]], [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] used cyclotomic fields to prove [[Fermat's last theorem]], which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''y''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''z''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nLocal fields are completions of global fields. [[Ostrowski's theorem]] asserts that the only completions of {{math|'''Q'''}}, a global field, are the local fields {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''R'''}}. Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the [[local-global principle]]. For example, the [[Hasse\u2013Minkowski theorem]] reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, whose solutions can easily be described.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1978|loc=Chapter IV}}</ref>\n\nUnlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. [[Inverse Galois theory]] studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group {{math|Gal(''F''/'''Q''')}} for some number field {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1992}}</ref> [[Class field theory]] describes the [[abelian extension]]s, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]], describes the maximal abelian {{math|'''Q'''<sup>ab</sup>}} extension of {{math|'''Q'''}}: it is the field\n:{{math|'''Q'''(&zeta;<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n'' &ge; 2)}}\nobtained by adjoining all primitive {{math|''n''}}-th roots of unity. [[Kronecker Jugendtraum|Kronecker's Jugendtraum]] asks for a similarly explicit description of {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} of general number fields {{math|''F''}}. For [[imaginary quadratic field]]s, <math>F=\\mathbf Q(\\sqrt{-d})</math>, {{math|''d'' > 0}}, the theory of [[complex multiplication]] describes {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} using [[elliptic curves]]. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.\n\n==Related notions==\n\nIn addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field 0 &ne; 1, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of [[field with one element]], which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, as {{math|''p''}} tends to 1.<ref>{{harvtxt|Tits|1957}}</ref> In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as [[quasifield]]s, [[Near-field (mathematics)|near-field]]s and [[semifield]]s.\n\nThere are also [[proper class]]es with field structure, which are sometimes called '''Fields''', with a capital F. The [[surreal number]]s form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The [[nimber]]s, a concept from [[game theory]], form such a Field as well.<ref>{{harvtxt|Conway|1976}}</ref>\n\n===Division rings===\n[[File:Hairy_ball.png|thumb|The hairy ball theorem states that a ball cannot be combed. More formally, there is no [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[tangent bundle|tangent vector field]] on the [[sphere]] {{math|S<sup>2</sup>}}, which is everywhere non-zero.]]\n\nDropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a ''[[division ring]]'' or ''skew field''.<ref group=nb>Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called ''commutative fields''.</ref> The only division rings that are finite-dimensional {{math|'''R'''}}-vector spaces are {{math|'''R'''}} itself, {{math|'''C'''}} (which is a field), the [[quaternion]]s {{math|'''H'''}} (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the [[octonion]]s {{math|'''O'''}} (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of [[algebraic topology]] in 1958 by [[Michel Kervaire]], [[Raoul Bott]], and [[John Milnor]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Baez|2002}}</ref> The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical.

In the 19th century, [[High Church]] members advocated changing the name, which they felt did not acknowledge the church's Catholic heritage. They were opposed by the church's evangelical wing, which felt that the \"Protestant Episcopal\" label accurately reflected the Reformed character of Anglicanism. After 1877, alternative names were regularly proposed and rejected by the General Convention. One proposed alternative was \"the American Catholic Church\". By the 1960s, opposition to dropping the word \"Protestant\" had largely subsided. In a 1964 General Convention compromise, priests and [[layperson|lay]] delegates suggested adding a preamble to the church's constitution, recognizing \"The Episcopal Church\" as a lawful alternate designation while still retaining the earlier name.<ref name=\"White-Dykman4-6\">{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Edwin|last2=Dykman|first2=Jackson|title=The Annotated Constitution and Canons for the Episcopal Church|year=1981|publisher=Church Publishing Incorporated|location=New York|isbn=978-0-89869-298-3|pages=4\u20136}}</ref>\n\nThe 66th General Convention voted in 1979 to use the name \"The Episcopal Church\" in the Oath of Conformity of the Declaration for Ordination.<ref>{{cite web|title=Acts of Convention # 1979-A125|url=http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=1979-A125 |date=1979}}</ref> The evolution of the name can be seen in the church's Book of Common Prayer.

While many Patriots were suspicious of Loyalism in the church, about three-quarters of the signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] were nominally Anglican laymen, including [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[William Paca]], and [[George Wythe]].{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} It was often assumed that persons considered \"High Church\" were Loyalists, whereas persons considered \"[[Low Church]]\" were Patriots: assumptions with possibly dangerous implications for the time.\n\n[[File:Old North Church Boston DSC 0816 ad.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Old North Church]] in [[Boston]].

This is in contrast to the less than 23 percent loyalist clergy in the four southern colonies.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} Many Church of England clergy remained loyalists as they took their two ordination oaths very seriously.

The [[Oath of Supremacy]] prevented Seabury's consecration in England, so he went to Scotland; the [[Nonjuring schism|non-juring]] Scottish bishops there consecrated him in [[Aberdeen]] on November 14, 1784, making him, in the words of scholar Arthur Carl Piepkorn, \"the first Anglican bishop appointed to minister outside the British Isles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeandwork.org/features/looking-back-first-overseas-bishop|title=Looking Back: First Overseas Bishop - Life and Work|website=www.lifeandwork.org}}</ref>{{sfn|Piepkorn|1977|p=199}} On August 3, 1785, the first ordinations on American soil took place at Christ Church in [[Middletown, Connecticut]].\n\nBy 1786, the church had succeeded in translating episcopacy to America and in revising the ''Book of Common Prayer'' to reflect American political realities. Later, through the efforts of Bishop [[Philander Chase]] (1775\u20131852) of Ohio, Americans successfully sought material assistance from England for the purpose of training Episcopal clergy. The development of the Protestant Episcopal Church provides an example of how Americans in the early republic maintained important cultural ties with England.{{sfn|Clark|1994}}\n\nIn 1787, two priests \u2013 [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]] of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Samuel Provoost]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] \u2013 were consecrated as bishops by the [[archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[archbishop of York]], and the [[bishop of Bath and Wells]], the legal obstacles having been removed by the passage through Parliament of the Consecration of Bishops Abroad Act 1786. Thus there are two branches of [[historical episcopate|Apostolic succession]] for the American bishops: through the non-juring bishops of Scotland who consecrated Samuel Seabury and through the English church who consecrated William White and Samuel Provoost. All bishops in the American Church are ordained by at least three bishops. One can trace the succession of each back to Seabury, White and Provoost. (''See [[Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States|Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church]].'')\n\nIn 1789, {{When|date=March 2017}}<!-- Doesn't anyone know the actual date? --> representative clergy from [[List of Original Dioceses of ECUSA|nine dioceses]] met in Philadelphia to ratify the church's initial constitution. The Episcopal Church was formally separated from the Church of England in 1789 so that clergy would not be required to accept the supremacy of the British monarch. A revised version of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' was written for the new church that same year. The fourth bishop of the Episcopal Church was [[James Madison (Episcopal bishop)|James Madison]], the first bishop of Virginia. Madison was consecrated in 1790 by the Archbishop of Canterbury and two other Church of England bishops. This third American bishop consecrated within the English line of succession occurred because of continuing unease within the Church of England over Seabury's [[Nonjuring schism|non-juring]] Scottish orders.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} The Episcopal Church thus became the first Anglican Province outside the [[British Isles]].<ref name=\"ABC\">{{cite book|author=The Archbishops' Group on the Episcopate|title=Episcopal Ministry: The Report of the Archbishops' Group on the Episcopate, 1990|year=1990|publisher=Church House Publishing|isbn=0-7151-3736-0|page=123}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 September 1792, at the triennial general convention ([[synod]]) of the Episcopal Church at [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] on [[Wall Street]], in [[New York City]], [[Thomas John Claggett]] was elected the first bishop of Maryland.

However, in the North the separation was never officially recognized. By May 16, 1866, the southern dioceses had rejoined the national church.{{sfn|Mason|1990}}\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, [[Evangelical Anglicanism|evangelical Episcopalians]] disturbed by [[High Church]] [[Tractarianism]], while continuing to work in interdenominational agencies, formed their own voluntary societies, and eventually, in 1874, a faction objecting to the revival of ritual practices established the [[Reformed Episcopal Church]].{{sfn|Butler|1995}}\n\n[[Samuel David Ferguson]] was the first black bishop consecrated by the Episcopal Church, the first to practice in the U.S. and the first black person to sit in the [[House of Bishops]]. Bishop Ferguson was consecrated on June 24, 1885, with the then-Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church acting as a consecrator.\n\nDuring the [[Gilded Age]], highly prominent laity such as banker [[J. P. Morgan]], industrialist [[Henry Ford]], and art collector [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]] played a central role in shaping a distinctive upper class Episcopalian ethos, especially with regard to preserving the arts and history. These philanthropists propelled the Episcopal Church into a quasi-national position of importance while at the same time giving the church a central role in the cultural transformation of the country.{{sfn|Williams|2006}} Another mark of influence is the fact that more than a quarter of all [[President of the United States|presidents of the United States]] have been Episcopalians (see [[religious affiliations of Presidents of the United States]]). It was during this period that the ''Book of Common Prayer'' was revised, first in 1892 and later in 1928.\n\n===Era of change (1958\u20131970s)===\nAt the 1958 general convention, a coalition of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] church members succeeded in passing a resolution recognizing \"the natural dignity and value of every man, of whatever color or race, as created in the image of God\". It called on Episcopalians \"to work together, in charity and forbearance, towards the establishment ... of full opportunities in fields such as education, housing, employment and public accommodations\". In response, the Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity (ESCRU) was founded in December 1959 in order to eliminate racial, ethnic and class barriers within the Episcopal Church. Opposition from southern church leaders prevented the Episcopal Church from taking a strong stand on civil rights prior to 1963. One prominent opponent of the movement was [[Charles Carpenter (bishop)|Charles C.J. Carpenter]], the Bishop of Alabama.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=134}} By 1963, many church leaders felt more comfortable speaking out in support of racial equality. That year, Presiding Bishop [[Arthur C. Lichtenberger|Arthur Lichtenberger]] wrote a pastoral letter urging Christians to work \"across lines of racial separation, in a common struggle for justice\", and the House of Bishops endorsed civil rights legislation.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=135}}\n\nIn 1967, Lichtenberger's successor, [[John E. Hines|John Hines]] led the Episcopal Church to implement the General Convention Special Program (GCSP). The program was designed to redirect nine million dollars over a three-year period (a quarter of the church's operating budget at the time) to fund special grants for community organizations and grassroots efforts facilitating black empowerment in America's urban ghettos.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=136}} The effectiveness of the GCSP was limited due to the reluctance of conservative bishops in southern dioceses, who objected to the awarding of grants to groups perceived as radical. The GCSP also drew opposition from the recently formed Foundation for Christian Theology, a conservative organization opposed to \"involv[ing] the Church in the social, political, and economic activities of our times\". The tension between liberal and conservative constituencies in the church erupted during the Special General Convention of 1969. The convention was disrupted by black militants who demanded that the Episcopal Church hear their concerns. When white deputies objected to allowing the militants a hearing, African-American deputies walked out of the convention. The Special General Convention also witnessed protests of the Vietnam War. During this time period, African-American clergy organized the [[Union of Black Episcopalians]] to achieve full inclusion of African Americans at all levels of the Episcopal Church. {{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=137-8}}\n\nThe liberal policies of Presiding Bishop Hines and the general conventions of 1967 and 1969 led to a conservative reaction. Facing declining membership and a one million dollar budget cut, the Special Program became an easy target for conservatives, who succeeded in drastically reducing the financial support for the program in 1970. It was finally ended in 1973 with little protest. A year later, Hines was succeeded by [[John Allin|John M.

The 1976 General Convention also passed a resolution calling for an end to [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]] and in 1985 called for \"dioceses, institutions, and agencies\" to create [[equal opportunity employment]] and [[affirmative action]] policies to address any potential \"racial inequities\" in clergy placement. Because of these and other controversial issues including abortion, individual members and clergy can and do frequently disagree with the stated position of the church's leadership.  In January 2016, the Anglican Primates Meeting at Canterbury decided that in response to the \"distance\" caused by what it called \"unilateral action on matters of doctrine without catholic unity\", \"for a period of three years, The Episcopal Church [would neither] represent [the Communion] on ecumenical and interfaith bodies\u2026 [nor] take part in decision making on any issues pertaining to doctrine or [[Ecclesiastical Polity|polity]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2016/01/statement-from-primates-2016.aspx|title=Statement from Primates 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Revised prayer book====\nIn 1976, the General Convention adopted a new prayer book, which was a substantial revision and modernization of the previous 1928 edition.

Some latitude in selecting Bible readings is allowed, but every service includes at least a passage from one of the Gospels, as well as the praying of the [[Lord's Prayer]].\n\nIn the Eucharist or [[Holy Communion]] service, the [[Book of Common Prayer]] specifies that bread and wine are consecrated for consumption by the people. A valid communion is made in either species, so those wishing for whatever reason to avoid alcohol can decline the cup and still make a valid communion. A Eucharist can be part of a wedding to celebrate a sacramental marriage and of a [[funeral]] as a thank offering (sacrifice) to God and for the comfort of the mourners.\n\nVarying styles and degrees of liturgical practice prevail within the church, including: traditional hymns and anthems, more modern religious music, Anglican chant, liturgical dance, charismatic prayer, and vested clergy. As varied as services can be, the central binding aspect is the [[Book of Common Prayer]] or supplemental liturgies. Most Episcopal services are similar in structure and liturgy to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], as the Eucharist is the central focus of the service (sometimes called ''Mass'' in High Church and some Broad Church circles). Generally, Episcopal churches have retained features such as the altar rail, the inclusion or exclusion of which does not elicit much controversy, but usually celebrate in the ''[[versus populum]]'' orientation.\n[[File:Rood Screen and Chancel ceiling, Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania).jpg|left|thumb|[[Rood Screen]] and Chancel Ceiling at the Anglo-Catholic [[Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania)]]]]\nOften a congregation or a particular service will be referred to as ''Low Church'' or ''High Church''. In theory:\n* [[High Church]], especially the ''very'' high [[Anglo-Catholic]] movement, is ritually inclined towards the use of incense, formal hymns, and a higher degree of ceremony such as ''[[ad orientem]]'' in relation to the priest and altar. In addition to clergy vesting in [[alb]]s, [[stole (vestment)|stoles]], and [[chasuble]]s, the lay assistants may also be vested in [[cassock]] and [[surplice]]. The sung Eucharist tends to be emphasized in High Church congregations, with Anglo-Catholic congregations and celebrants using sung services almost exclusively. [[Marian devotion]] is sometimes seen in the Anglo-Catholic and some High Church parishes. \n* [[Low Church]] is simpler and may incorporate other elements such as informal praise and worship music. \"Low\" parishes tend towards a more \"traditional Protestant\" outlook with its emphasis of Biblical revelation over symbolism. A few \"low\" parishes even subscribe to traditional [[Evangelical]] theology (see [[Evangelical Anglicanism]]). The spoken Eucharist tends to be emphasized in Low Church congregations. [[Altar rails]] may be omitted in this type.\n* [[Broad Church]] indicates a middle ground. These parishes are the most common within The Episcopal Church. However, unlike the Anglican Church in England, most Episcopal 'broad church' parishes make use of a catholic liturgy that includes eucharistic vestments, chant, and a high view of the sacraments, even if the liturgy is not as solemn or lacks some of the other accoutrements typical of Anglo-Catholic parishes. Unlike mainstream Catholic Churches, the altar rail has usually been retained and communion is usually served kneeling at the altar rail similar to a [[Tridentine Mass]], because the Episcopal Church teaches, through its [[Book of Common Prayer]], a theologically high view of the Church and its sacraments, even if not all parishes carry this out liturgically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gracechurchinnewark.org/how-the-episcopal-church-teaches.php |title=Grace Church in Newark}}</ref>\n\n[[File:High altar at St. Mary's Episcopal Church..JPG|left|thumb|High altar of an Anglo-Catholic church ''[[ad orientem]]'' style]]\nA majority of Episcopal services could be considered to be \"High Church\" while still falling somewhat short of a typical Anglo-Catholic \"very\" high church service. In contrast, \"Low Church\" services are somewhat rarer. However, while some Episcopalians refer to their churches by these labels, often there is overlapping, and the basic rites do not greatly differ. There are also variations that blend elements of all three and have their own unique features, such as New England Episcopal churches, which have elements drawn from Puritan practices, combining the traditions of \"high church\" with the simplicity of \"low church\".\n\nThe veneration of [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church)|saints in the Episcopal Church]] is a continuation of an ancient tradition from the early Church which honors important people of the Christian faith. The usage of the term \"saint\" is similar to Catholic and Orthodox traditions. There are explicit references in the 1979 Book of Common Prayer to invoking the aid of the prophets, patriarchs, saints, martyrs and the Virgin Mary as in an optional prayer in the committal at a funeral, p.&nbsp;504. In general Anglicans pray with and for the saints in the fellowship of the saints, not to them, although their intercessions may be requested. Those inclined to the Anglo-Catholic traditions may explicitly invoke saints as intercessors in prayer.\n\n===Book of Common Prayer===\n[[File:1979 BCP title.jpg|thumbnail|right|The 1979 Book of Common Prayer]]\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2015}}\n{{main|Book of Common Prayer}}\nThe Episcopal Church [[Custodian of the Standard Book of Common Prayer|publishes]] its own [[Book of Common Prayer]] (BCP) (similar to other Anglican prayer books), containing most of the worship services (or [[liturgy|liturgies]]) used in the Episcopal Church. Because of its widespread use in the church, the BCP is both a reflection and source of theology for Episcopalians.\n\nThe full name of the BCP is: ''The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments and Other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church Together with The Psalter or Psalms of David According to the use of The Episcopal Church''.\n\nPrevious American BCPs were issued in 1789, 1892, and 1928. A proposed BCP was issued in 1786 but not adopted. The BCP is in the [[public domain]]; however, any new revisions of the BCP are copyrighted until they are approved by the General Convention, after which they are placed in the public domain.\n\nThe current edition dates from 1979 and is marked by language modernization and, in returning to ancient Christian tradition, a restoration of the Eucharist as the central [[liturgy]] of the church. The 1979 version reflects the theological and worship changes of the ecumenical reforms of the 1960s and 1970s. On the whole, the revision changed the theological emphasis of the church to be more Catholic in nature. In 1979, the Convention adopted the revision as the \"official\" BCP and required churches using the previous 1928 prayer book to also use the new revision. There was enough strife in implementing and adopting the 1979 BCP that an apology was issued at the 2000 General Convention<ref>{{cite web |website=The Archives of the Episcopal Church |url=http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution.pl?resolution=2000-B034 |series=Acts of Convention |title=Resolution #2000-B034, Apologize to Those Offended During Liturgical Transition to the 1979 Book of Common Prayer |access-date=2008-10-31 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> to any who were \"offended or alienated during the time of liturgical transition to the 1979 Book of Common Prayer\".

Some Episcopal members or theologians hold [[evangelical]] positions, affirming the authority of [[sola scriptura|scripture over all]]. The Episcopal Church website glossary defines the sources of authority as a balance between scripture, tradition, and reason. These three are characterized as a \"three-legged stool\" which will topple if any one overbalances the other. It also notes<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090904145347/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/19625_13797_ENG_HTM.htm Authority, Sources of (in Anglicanism)] on the Episcopal Church site, accessed on April 19, 2007, which in turn credits Church Publishing Incorporated, New York, NY, from ''An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, A User Friendly Reference for Episcopalians,'' Don S.

It has also been associated with the Anglican willingness to tolerate and comprehend opposing viewpoints instead of imposing tests of orthodoxy or resorting to heresy trials.}}\nThis balance of scripture, tradition and reason is traced to the work of [[Richard Hooker]], a 16th-century apologist. In Hooker's model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine and things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080723214242/http://www.anglicanlistening.org/anglican_listening_61766_ENG_HTM.htm Anglican Listening] on the Episcopal Church site goes into detail on how scripture, tradition, and reason work to \"uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way\".</ref> Noting the role of personal experience in Christian life, some Episcopalians have advocated following the example of the [[Wesleyan Quadrilateral]] of [[Methodist]] theology by thinking in terms of a \"Fourth Leg\" of \"experience\". This understanding is highly dependent on the work of [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Friedrich Schleiermacher]].\n\nA public example of this struggle between different Christian positions in the church has been the 2003 consecration of [[Gene Robinson]], an openly gay man living with a long-term partner. The acceptance/rejection of his consecration is motivated by different views on the understanding of scripture.<ref>As stated in section 2.16 of [https://web.archive.org/web/20050623174848/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/documents/ToSetOurHopeOnChrist.pdf To Set Our Hope On Christ (PDF)], because \"the biblical writers [...] write at different times and in different circumstances, they do not always agree with one another. [...] For example, it is helpful to know that when Ezra (chapter 10) commands the men of Israel to divorce their wives, it is because they had married foreign wives, who are seen to be a danger to Israel in exile. But there is another belief about foreign wives in the Book of Ruth, probably written at about the same time. [...] Today, in some situations, it may be faithful to follow Ezra, while in most situations it is faithful to follow Ruth.\"</ref> This struggle has some members concerned that the church may not continue its relationship with the larger Anglican Church.

In the 19th century, [[High Church]] members advocated changing the name, which they felt did not acknowledge the church's Catholic heritage. They were opposed by the church's evangelical wing, which felt that the \"Protestant Episcopal\" label accurately reflected the Reformed character of Anglicanism. After 1877, alternative names were regularly proposed and rejected by the General Convention. One proposed alternative was \"the American Catholic Church\". By the 1960s, opposition to dropping the word \"Protestant\" had largely subsided. In a 1964 General Convention compromise, priests and [[layperson|lay]] delegates suggested adding a preamble to the church's constitution, recognizing \"The Episcopal Church\" as a lawful alternate designation while still retaining the earlier name.<ref name=\"White-Dykman4-6\">{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Edwin|last2=Dykman|first2=Jackson|title=The Annotated Constitution and Canons for the Episcopal Church|year=1981|publisher=Church Publishing Incorporated|location=New York|isbn=978-0-89869-298-3|pages=4\u20136}}</ref>\n\nThe 66th General Convention voted in 1979 to use the name \"The Episcopal Church\" in the Oath of Conformity of the Declaration for Ordination.<ref>{{cite web|title=Acts of Convention # 1979-A125|url=http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=1979-A125 |date=1979}}</ref> The evolution of the name can be seen in the church's Book of Common Prayer.

The Jamestown church building itself is a modern reconstruction.{{sfn|Sydnor|1980|p=72}}\n\nAlthough no American Anglican bishops existed in the colonial era, the Church of England had an official status in several colonies, which meant that local governments paid tax money to local parishes, and the parishes handled some civic functions.

While many Patriots were suspicious of Loyalism in the church, about three-quarters of the signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] were nominally Anglican laymen, including [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[William Paca]], and [[George Wythe]].{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} It was often assumed that persons considered \"High Church\" were Loyalists, whereas persons considered \"[[Low Church]]\" were Patriots: assumptions with possibly dangerous implications for the time.\n\n[[File:Old North Church Boston DSC 0816 ad.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Old North Church]] in [[Boston]].

This is in contrast to the less than 23 percent loyalist clergy in the four southern colonies.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} Many Church of England clergy remained loyalists as they took their two ordination oaths very seriously. Anglican clergy were obliged to swear allegiance to the king as well as to pray for the king, the royal family, and the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]].{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} In general, loyalist clergy stayed by their oaths and prayed for the king or else suspended services.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} By the end of 1776, some Anglican churches were closing.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} Anglican priests held services in private homes or lay readers who were not bound by the oaths held morning and evening prayer.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} During 1775 and 1776, the Continental Congress had issued decrees ordering churches to fast and pray on behalf of the patriots.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} Starting July 4, 1776, Congress and several states passed laws making prayers for the king and British Parliament acts of treason.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} The patriot clergy in the South were quick to find reasons to transfer their oaths to the American cause and prayed for the success of the Revolution.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} One precedent was the transfer of oaths during the [[Glorious Revolution]] in England.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} Most of the patriot clergy in the South were able to keep their churches open and services continued.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}}\n\n===Early Republic era===\nIn the wake of the Revolution, American Episcopalians faced the task of preserving a hierarchical church structure in a society infused with [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]].\n\n[[File:Old Swedes 2 NJ.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Trinity Church (Swedesboro, New Jersey)|Trinity Church]] in [[Swedesboro, New Jersey]].

The [[Oath of Supremacy]] prevented Seabury's consecration in England, so he went to Scotland; the [[Nonjuring schism|non-juring]] Scottish bishops there consecrated him in [[Aberdeen]] on November 14, 1784, making him, in the words of scholar Arthur Carl Piepkorn, \"the first Anglican bishop appointed to minister outside the British Isles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeandwork.org/features/looking-back-first-overseas-bishop|title=Looking Back: First Overseas Bishop - Life and Work|website=www.lifeandwork.org}}</ref>{{sfn|Piepkorn|1977|p=199}} On August 3, 1785, the first ordinations on American soil took place at Christ Church in [[Middletown, Connecticut]].\n\nBy 1786, the church had succeeded in translating episcopacy to America and in revising the ''Book of Common Prayer'' to reflect American political realities. Later, through the efforts of Bishop [[Philander Chase]] (1775\u20131852) of Ohio, Americans successfully sought material assistance from England for the purpose of training Episcopal clergy. The development of the Protestant Episcopal Church provides an example of how Americans in the early republic maintained important cultural ties with England.{{sfn|Clark|1994}}\n\nIn 1787, two priests \u2013 [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]] of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Samuel Provoost]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] \u2013 were consecrated as bishops by the [[archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[archbishop of York]], and the [[bishop of Bath and Wells]], the legal obstacles having been removed by the passage through Parliament of the Consecration of Bishops Abroad Act 1786. Thus there are two branches of [[historical episcopate|Apostolic succession]] for the American bishops: through the non-juring bishops of Scotland who consecrated Samuel Seabury and through the English church who consecrated William White and Samuel Provoost. All bishops in the American Church are ordained by at least three bishops. One can trace the succession of each back to Seabury, White and Provoost. (''See [[Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States|Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church]].'')\n\nIn 1789, {{When|date=March 2017}}<!-- Doesn't anyone know the actual date? --> representative clergy from [[List of Original Dioceses of ECUSA|nine dioceses]] met in Philadelphia to ratify the church's initial constitution. The Episcopal Church was formally separated from the Church of England in 1789 so that clergy would not be required to accept the supremacy of the British monarch. A revised version of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' was written for the new church that same year. The fourth bishop of the Episcopal Church was [[James Madison (Episcopal bishop)|James Madison]], the first bishop of Virginia. Madison was consecrated in 1790 by the Archbishop of Canterbury and two other Church of England bishops. This third American bishop consecrated within the English line of succession occurred because of continuing unease within the Church of England over Seabury's [[Nonjuring schism|non-juring]] Scottish orders.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} The Episcopal Church thus became the first Anglican Province outside the [[British Isles]].<ref name=\"ABC\">{{cite book|author=The Archbishops' Group on the Episcopate|title=Episcopal Ministry: The Report of the Archbishops' Group on the Episcopate, 1990|year=1990|publisher=Church House Publishing|isbn=0-7151-3736-0|page=123}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 September 1792, at the triennial general convention ([[synod]]) of the Episcopal Church at [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] on [[Wall Street]], in [[New York City]], [[Thomas John Claggett]] was elected the first bishop of Maryland.

By May 16, 1866, the southern dioceses had rejoined the national church.{{sfn|Mason|1990}}\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, [[Evangelical Anglicanism|evangelical Episcopalians]] disturbed by [[High Church]] [[Tractarianism]], while continuing to work in interdenominational agencies, formed their own voluntary societies, and eventually, in 1874, a faction objecting to the revival of ritual practices established the [[Reformed Episcopal Church]].{{sfn|Butler|1995}}\n\n[[Samuel David Ferguson]] was the first black bishop consecrated by the Episcopal Church, the first to practice in the U.S. and the first black person to sit in the [[House of Bishops]]. Bishop Ferguson was consecrated on June 24, 1885, with the then-Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church acting as a consecrator.\n\nDuring the [[Gilded Age]], highly prominent laity such as banker [[J. P. Morgan]], industrialist [[Henry Ford]], and art collector [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]] played a central role in shaping a distinctive upper class Episcopalian ethos, especially with regard to preserving the arts and history. These philanthropists propelled the Episcopal Church into a quasi-national position of importance while at the same time giving the church a central role in the cultural transformation of the country.{{sfn|Williams|2006}} Another mark of influence is the fact that more than a quarter of all [[President of the United States|presidents of the United States]] have been Episcopalians (see [[religious affiliations of Presidents of the United States]]). It was during this period that the ''Book of Common Prayer'' was revised, first in 1892 and later in 1928.\n\n===Era of change (1958\u20131970s)===\nAt the 1958 general convention, a coalition of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] church members succeeded in passing a resolution recognizing \"the natural dignity and value of every man, of whatever color or race, as created in the image of God\". It called on Episcopalians \"to work together, in charity and forbearance, towards the establishment ... of full opportunities in fields such as education, housing, employment and public accommodations\". In response, the Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity (ESCRU) was founded in December 1959 in order to eliminate racial, ethnic and class barriers within the Episcopal Church. Opposition from southern church leaders prevented the Episcopal Church from taking a strong stand on civil rights prior to 1963. One prominent opponent of the movement was [[Charles Carpenter (bishop)|Charles C.J. Carpenter]], the Bishop of Alabama.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=134}} By 1963, many church leaders felt more comfortable speaking out in support of racial equality. That year, Presiding Bishop [[Arthur C. Lichtenberger|Arthur Lichtenberger]] wrote a pastoral letter urging Christians to work \"across lines of racial separation, in a common struggle for justice\", and the House of Bishops endorsed civil rights legislation.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=135}}\n\nIn 1967, Lichtenberger's successor, [[John E. Hines|John Hines]] led the Episcopal Church to implement the General Convention Special Program (GCSP). The program was designed to redirect nine million dollars over a three-year period (a quarter of the church's operating budget at the time) to fund special grants for community organizations and grassroots efforts facilitating black empowerment in America's urban ghettos.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=136}} The effectiveness of the GCSP was limited due to the reluctance of conservative bishops in southern dioceses, who objected to the awarding of grants to groups perceived as radical. The GCSP also drew opposition from the recently formed Foundation for Christian Theology, a conservative organization opposed to \"involv[ing] the Church in the social, political, and economic activities of our times\". The tension between liberal and conservative constituencies in the church erupted during the Special General Convention of 1969. The convention was disrupted by black militants who demanded that the Episcopal Church hear their concerns. When white deputies objected to allowing the militants a hearing, African-American deputies walked out of the convention. The Special General Convention also witnessed protests of the Vietnam War. During this time period, African-American clergy organized the [[Union of Black Episcopalians]] to achieve full inclusion of African Americans at all levels of the Episcopal Church. {{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=137-8}}\n\nThe liberal policies of Presiding Bishop Hines and the general conventions of 1967 and 1969 led to a conservative reaction. Facing declining membership and a one million dollar budget cut, the Special Program became an easy target for conservatives, who succeeded in drastically reducing the financial support for the program in 1970. It was finally ended in 1973 with little protest. A year later, Hines was succeeded by [[John Allin|John M. Allin]], the Bishop of Mississippi and a conservative.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=138}}\n\nThe first women were admitted as delegates to the church's general convention in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/75383_73867_ENG_HTM.htm|title=News Coverage from the 75th General Convention of the Episcopal Church|publisher=Episcopalchurch.org|accessdate=2010-11-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117063650/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/75383_73867_ENG_HTM.htm|archivedate=2011-01-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1975, Vaughan Booker, who confessed to the murder of his wife and was sentenced to life in prison, was ordained to the diaconate in [[State Correctional Institution \u2013 Graterford|Graterford State Prison]]'s chapel in Pennsylvania, after having repented of his sins, becoming a symbol of redemption and atonement.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Christopher|title=He's a Walking Contradiction|journal=The Living Church|publication-date=1995-02-26|volume=210|issue=9|url=http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/the_living_church/TLCarticle.pl?volume=210&issue=9&article_id=1|page=11}}</ref>{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=17}}\n\n===Recent history===\nIn recent decades, the Episcopal Church, like other [[Mainline Protestant|mainline]] churches, has experienced a decline in membership as well as internal controversy over [[Ordination of women#Anglican|women's ordination]] and the [[Homosexuality and Anglicanism|place of homosexuals in the church]]. The 1976 General Convention also passed a resolution calling for an end to [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]] and in 1985 called for \"dioceses, institutions, and agencies\" to create [[equal opportunity employment]] and [[affirmative action]] policies to address any potential \"racial inequities\" in clergy placement. Because of these and other controversial issues including abortion, individual members and clergy can and do frequently disagree with the stated position of the church's leadership.  In January 2016, the Anglican Primates Meeting at Canterbury decided that in response to the \"distance\" caused by what it called \"unilateral action on matters of doctrine without catholic unity\", \"for a period of three years, The Episcopal Church [would neither] represent [the Communion] on ecumenical and interfaith bodies\u2026 [nor] take part in decision making on any issues pertaining to doctrine or [[Ecclesiastical Polity|polity]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2016/01/statement-from-primates-2016.aspx|title=Statement from Primates 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Revised prayer book====\nIn 1976, the General Convention adopted a new prayer book, which was a substantial revision and modernization of the previous 1928 edition.

In 1994, the General Convention affirmed that there was value in the theological position that women should not be ordained.

Some latitude in selecting Bible readings is allowed, but every service includes at least a passage from one of the Gospels, as well as the praying of the [[Lord's Prayer]].\n\nIn the Eucharist or [[Holy Communion]] service, the [[Book of Common Prayer]] specifies that bread and wine are consecrated for consumption by the people. A valid communion is made in either species, so those wishing for whatever reason to avoid alcohol can decline the cup and still make a valid communion. A Eucharist can be part of a wedding to celebrate a sacramental marriage and of a [[funeral]] as a thank offering (sacrifice) to God and for the comfort of the mourners.\n\nVarying styles and degrees of liturgical practice prevail within the church, including: traditional hymns and anthems, more modern religious music, Anglican chant, liturgical dance, charismatic prayer, and vested clergy. As varied as services can be, the central binding aspect is the [[Book of Common Prayer]] or supplemental liturgies. Most Episcopal services are similar in structure and liturgy to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], as the Eucharist is the central focus of the service (sometimes called ''Mass'' in High Church and some Broad Church circles). Generally, Episcopal churches have retained features such as the altar rail, the inclusion or exclusion of which does not elicit much controversy, but usually celebrate in the ''[[versus populum]]'' orientation.\n[[File:Rood Screen and Chancel ceiling, Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania).jpg|left|thumb|[[Rood Screen]] and Chancel Ceiling at the Anglo-Catholic [[Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania)]]]]\nOften a congregation or a particular service will be referred to as ''Low Church'' or ''High Church''. In theory:\n* [[High Church]], especially the ''very'' high [[Anglo-Catholic]] movement, is ritually inclined towards the use of incense, formal hymns, and a higher degree of ceremony such as ''[[ad orientem]]'' in relation to the priest and altar. In addition to clergy vesting in [[alb]]s, [[stole (vestment)|stoles]], and [[chasuble]]s, the lay assistants may also be vested in [[cassock]] and [[surplice]]. The sung Eucharist tends to be emphasized in High Church congregations, with Anglo-Catholic congregations and celebrants using sung services almost exclusively. [[Marian devotion]] is sometimes seen in the Anglo-Catholic and some High Church parishes. \n* [[Low Church]] is simpler and may incorporate other elements such as informal praise and worship music. \"Low\" parishes tend towards a more \"traditional Protestant\" outlook with its emphasis of Biblical revelation over symbolism. A few \"low\" parishes even subscribe to traditional [[Evangelical]] theology (see [[Evangelical Anglicanism]]). The spoken Eucharist tends to be emphasized in Low Church congregations. [[Altar rails]] may be omitted in this type.\n* [[Broad Church]] indicates a middle ground. These parishes are the most common within The Episcopal Church. However, unlike the Anglican Church in England, most Episcopal 'broad church' parishes make use of a catholic liturgy that includes eucharistic vestments, chant, and a high view of the sacraments, even if the liturgy is not as solemn or lacks some of the other accoutrements typical of Anglo-Catholic parishes. Unlike mainstream Catholic Churches, the altar rail has usually been retained and communion is usually served kneeling at the altar rail similar to a [[Tridentine Mass]], because the Episcopal Church teaches, through its [[Book of Common Prayer]], a theologically high view of the Church and its sacraments, even if not all parishes carry this out liturgically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gracechurchinnewark.org/how-the-episcopal-church-teaches.php |title=Grace Church in Newark}}</ref>\n\n[[File:High altar at St. Mary's Episcopal Church..JPG|left|thumb|High altar of an Anglo-Catholic church ''[[ad orientem]]'' style]]\nA majority of Episcopal services could be considered to be \"High Church\" while still falling somewhat short of a typical Anglo-Catholic \"very\" high church service. In contrast, \"Low Church\" services are somewhat rarer. However, while some Episcopalians refer to their churches by these labels, often there is overlapping, and the basic rites do not greatly differ. There are also variations that blend elements of all three and have their own unique features, such as New England Episcopal churches, which have elements drawn from Puritan practices, combining the traditions of \"high church\" with the simplicity of \"low church\".\n\nThe veneration of [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church)|saints in the Episcopal Church]] is a continuation of an ancient tradition from the early Church which honors important people of the Christian faith. The usage of the term \"saint\" is similar to Catholic and Orthodox traditions. There are explicit references in the 1979 Book of Common Prayer to invoking the aid of the prophets, patriarchs, saints, martyrs and the Virgin Mary as in an optional prayer in the committal at a funeral, p.&nbsp;504. In general Anglicans pray with and for the saints in the fellowship of the saints, not to them, although their intercessions may be requested. Those inclined to the Anglo-Catholic traditions may explicitly invoke saints as intercessors in prayer.\n\n===Book of Common Prayer===\n[[File:1979 BCP title.jpg|thumbnail|right|The 1979 Book of Common Prayer]]\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2015}}\n{{main|Book of Common Prayer}}\nThe Episcopal Church [[Custodian of the Standard Book of Common Prayer|publishes]] its own [[Book of Common Prayer]] (BCP) (similar to other Anglican prayer books), containing most of the worship services (or [[liturgy|liturgies]]) used in the Episcopal Church. Because of its widespread use in the church, the BCP is both a reflection and source of theology for Episcopalians.\n\nThe full name of the BCP is: ''The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments and Other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church Together with The Psalter or Psalms of David According to the use of The Episcopal Church''.\n\nPrevious American BCPs were issued in 1789, 1892, and 1928. A proposed BCP was issued in 1786 but not adopted.

The 1979 version reflects the theological and worship changes of the ecumenical reforms of the 1960s and 1970s. On the whole, the revision changed the theological emphasis of the church to be more Catholic in nature. In 1979, the Convention adopted the revision as the \"official\" BCP and required churches using the previous 1928 prayer book to also use the new revision.

Some Episcopal members or theologians hold [[evangelical]] positions, affirming the authority of [[sola scriptura|scripture over all]]. The Episcopal Church website glossary defines the sources of authority as a balance between scripture, tradition, and reason. These three are characterized as a \"three-legged stool\" which will topple if any one overbalances the other. It also notes<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090904145347/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/19625_13797_ENG_HTM.htm Authority, Sources of (in Anglicanism)] on the Episcopal Church site, accessed on April 19, 2007, which in turn credits Church Publishing Incorporated, New York, NY, from ''An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, A User Friendly Reference for Episcopalians,'' Don S.

It has also been associated with the Anglican willingness to tolerate and comprehend opposing viewpoints instead of imposing tests of orthodoxy or resorting to heresy trials.}}\nThis balance of scripture, tradition and reason is traced to the work of [[Richard Hooker]], a 16th-century apologist. In Hooker's model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine and things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080723214242/http://www.anglicanlistening.org/anglican_listening_61766_ENG_HTM.htm Anglican Listening] on the Episcopal Church site goes into detail on how scripture, tradition, and reason work to \"uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way\".</ref> Noting the role of personal experience in Christian life, some Episcopalians have advocated following the example of the [[Wesleyan Quadrilateral]] of [[Methodist]] theology by thinking in terms of a \"Fourth Leg\" of \"experience\". This understanding is highly dependent on the work of [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Friedrich Schleiermacher]].\n\nA public example of this struggle between different Christian positions in the church has been the 2003 consecration of [[Gene Robinson]], an openly gay man living with a long-term partner. The acceptance/rejection of his consecration is motivated by different views on the understanding of scripture.<ref>As stated in section 2.16 of [https://web.archive.org/web/20050623174848/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/documents/ToSetOurHopeOnChrist.pdf To Set Our Hope On Christ (PDF)], because \"the biblical writers [...] write at different times and in different circumstances, they do not always agree with one another. [...] For example, it is helpful to know that when Ezra (chapter 10) commands the men of Israel to divorce their wives, it is because they had married foreign wives, who are seen to be a danger to Israel in exile. But there is another belief about foreign wives in the Book of Ruth, probably written at about the same time. [...] Today, in some situations, it may be faithful to follow Ezra, while in most situations it is faithful to follow Ruth.\"</ref> This struggle has some members concerned that the church may not continue its relationship with the larger Anglican Church.

Further work in 2010 with [[BBC Oceans]] and the [[BBC One Show|BBC ''One Show'']] used novel acoustic imaging cameras (dual-frequency identification sonar \u2013 DIDSON) to film the ruins through the turbid water. These clearly showed the jumble of ruined blocks and worked stone associated with medieval church and chapel sites. A large survey and updating of the mapped data was commissioned by English Heritage in 2011 and reported in 2012. This compiled all previous survey data and enhanced the historical map and coastal pilot charts for the site. The results have produced the most comprehensive survey of the Dunwich town site \u2013 the largest medieval underwater site in Europe.

His most notable films include the \"Gates of Hell\" trilogy\u2014''[[City of the Living Dead]]'' (1980), ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' (1981), and ''[[The House by the Cemetery]]'' (1981)\u2014as well as ''[[Massacre Time]]'' (1966), ''[[One on Top of the Other]]'' (1969), ''[[A Lizard in a Woman's Skin]]'' (1971), ''[[Don't Torture a Duckling]]'' (1972), ''[[White Fang (1973 film)|White Fang]]'' (1973), ''[[Four of the Apocalypse]]'' (1975), ''[[Sette note in nero]]'' (1977), ''[[Zombi 2]]'' (1979), ''[[The Beyond]]'' (1981), ''[[The New York Ripper]]''(1982), and ''[[A Cat in the Brain]]'' (1990).

Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press. page 202.</ref>.\n\nBecause of the high level of visceral [[Splatter film|graphic violence]] present in many of his films, especially ''Zombi 2'', ''The Beyond'', ''Contraband'' and ''The New York Ripper'', Fulci is frequently referred to as \"The Godfather of Gore\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houseofhorrors.com/fulci.htm|title=Lucio Fulci: Godfather of Gore|work=houseofhorrors.com|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> a title also given to [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]].\n\n==Life and career==\nLucio Fulci was born in Trastavere, [[Rome]] on 17 June 1927. His mother Lucia was from a very poor but reputable [[Sicilians|Sicilian]], politically anti-fascist family, from [[Messina]], [[Sicily]]. She had earlier eloped to Rome with a lover who later left her to raise their child (Lucio) alone. Lucio was raised by his mother and a female housekeeper. He attended the Naval College in Venice, and near the end of WW2, completed his studies back in Rome at the [[Giulio Cesare State Classical School]]. He was interested in art, music, film, soccer and always had a love for sailing.  <ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films.

He was in his young adult years a politically active radical for the [[Italian Communist Party]]. Fulci was even arrested by the police for demonstrating with the Communist Party. An assassination attempt on party leader Palmiro Togliatti caused a political crisis in Italy and calls for a general strike. After this incident, his relationship with his family became tense and chaotic and he lived an impoverished life for a time. \n\nHis mother encouraged him to be a lawyer, but he wound up going to medical school instead.<ref>Paolo Albiero & Giacomo Cacciatore: \"Dalla sinistra di via Veneto alla destra di Steno\" (1927-1958)</ref> <ref name=FC1 /><ref name=AD2 /><ref name=LAZ3 /> After studying medicine for a time, he dropped out before completing his training, deciding that his true interests lay in cinema.

The famed Italian director [[Steno]] took Fulci under his wing and allowed him to assist in the making of a number of comedies starring [[Tot\u00f2]]<ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press.</ref>. Fulci finally became a full-fledged movie director beginning with ''I Ladri'' in 1959. \n\nIn the 1960s, Fulci wrote or directed more than 30 Italian comedies<ref>Filmography section</ref>, eleven of them starring the famous Italian comedian team of [[Franco Franchi]] and [[Ciccio Ingrassia]]. Most of these early comedies did not enjoy distribution in English-speaking markets, and are thus generally unavailable today in English. Fulci's first film to be distributed theatrically in the USA was ''Oh! Those Most Secret Agents!'' in 1965. Only three of his other 1960s films were ever released in the U.S.: ''Massacre Time'' (released as ''[[The Brute and the Beast]]'' in 1968), ''[[Una sull'altra]]'' (as ''[[One on Top of the Other]]'' in 1973) and ''Beatrice Cenci'' (as ''[[Conspiracy of Torture]]'', in 1976).\n\nFulci moved into directing [[giallo]] thrillers with ''[[Una sull'altra]]'' (1969), ''[[A Lizard in a Woman's Skin]]'' (1971) and ''[[Sette note in nero]]'' (''The Psychic'', 1977), as well as Spaghetti Westerns such as ''[[Four of the Apocalypse]]'' (1975) and ''[[Silver Saddle]]'' (1978), all of which were commercially successful and controversial in their depictions of graphic violence.  Some of the [[special effects]] in ''A Lizard in a Woman's Skin'' involving mutilated dogs in a vivisection room were so realistic that Fulci was dragged into court and charged with animal cruelty until he produced the artificial canine puppets that were used in the film (created by special effects maestro [[Carlo Rambaldi]]).<ref name=FC1 /><ref name=AD2 /><ref name=LAZ3 />\n\nHis first film to gain significant notoriety in his native country, ''[[Don't Torture a Duckling]]'' (1972), combined scathing social commentary with the director's trademark graphic violence.

His features released from 1979 through 1982 (most of them scripted by famed Italian screenwriter [[Dardano Sacchetti]]) were described by some critics as being among the most violent and gory films ever made. ''[[City of the Living Dead]]'' (1980), ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' (1981), ''[[The House by the Cemetery]]'' (1981), ''[[The Black Cat (1981 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1981), ''[[The New York Ripper]]'' (1982) and ''[[Manhattan Baby]]'' (1982) were among his biggest hits, all of which were noted for their extreme content and significant amount of gore. Fulci also enjoyed acting, and indulged himself by giving himself cameo appearances in sixteen of the films he directed between 1967 and 1991.(See Filmography below). He also appeared in a cameo in a 1961 rock and roll film ''Sanremo - la Grande Sfida'' which he did not direct, and was featured on the film's one-sheet poster as well.<ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press. Filmography section</ref>\n\nSeveral of Fulci's movies released in America were edited by the [[film distributor]] to ensure an [[MPAA film rating system|R rating]], such as ''The Beyond'', which was originally released on video in severely edited form as ''Seven Doors of Death''. Others were released Unrated in order to avoid an [[X-rating]] (as with ''Zombi 2'' and ''House by the Cemetery'') which would have restricted the films' target audiences to adults. The unrated films often played worldwide in [[drive-in theater|drive-ins]] and [[grindhouse]]s where they developed a cult following. Many of Fulci's horror films tend to contain \"injury to the eye\" sequences, in which a character's eyeball is either pierced or pulled out of its socket, usually in lingering, close-up detail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/3261090|title=No Eyes are Safe: Lucio Fulci|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of Fulci's movies were prohibited in Europe or were released in heavily cut versions. Of the original 72 films on the infamous [[video nasty]] list in the United Kingdom, three belonged to Fulci: ''Zombi 2'' (1979), ''The Beyond'' (1981), and ''House by the Cemetery'' (1981). After viewing Fulci's ''The New York Ripper'', not only did the [[British Board of Film Classification]] refuse the film a certificate, but every single print in the country was taken to an airport and returned to Italy by order of [[James Ferman]]; it was not until later that [[VIPCO]] allowed the release of the film, initially outsourcing production to a foreign source under police supervision before releasing a [[VHS]] in 2002 and a [[DVD]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084719/trivia |title=The New York Ripper (1982) - Trivia |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter collaborating with screenwriter Sacchetti for six years, Fulci went off on his own in 1983 to direct the movie ''[[Conquest (1983 film)|Conquest]]''  (a Conan-like barbarian fantasy) in [[Mexico]], failing to involve Sacchetti in the deal. The film did poorly upon its release, and afterwards, Fulci had trouble jump-starting his working relationship with Sacchetti, who by that time had gone his own way.\n\nFulci became ill from hepatitis in 1984, right after he finished directing ''[[Murder Rock]]'' in New York City, and had to be hospitalized in Italy for many months. Fulci spent most of 1984 hospitalized with [[cirrhosis]], and much of 1985 recuperating at home. After 1986, with diabetes plaguing him and the departure of screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti from his circle of friends, Fulci's endeavors as a director suffered. \n\nIn 1988, he had directed about two-thirds of ''[[Zombi 3]]'' in the [[Philippines]] before having to return abruptly to Italy due to a second bout of hepatitis. The film was finished by an uncredited [[Bruno Mattei]]. Fulci later said that he hated the finished film and tried unsuccessfully to get his name removed from the credits. Mattei has said in interviews that the film was Fulci's, and that he (Mattei) just added a few extra scenes to pad out the running time.{{sfn|Thrower|1999}}\n\nIn 1989, Fulci was hired to direct a pair of made-for-TV horror movies for the Italian market, neither of which aired in Italy due to the high amount of gore and violence. They were released later on DVD, however, outside of Italy. Fulci's intended comeback films ''[[Demonia (film)|Demonia]]'' and ''[[A Cat in the Brain]]'' were produced in 1990. Both films struggled to get released and were considered critical disappointments. His final project, the 1991 psychological thriller ''[[The Door to Silence]]'', based on one of his own short stories, also received poor reviews. The release of this film is seen by some as the critical lowest point of his career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esplatter.com/reviews.php?id=22 |title=Horror Movie Review of Zombi 3 (Lucio Fulci) |last=Gore |first=Lucius |work=ESplatter |access-date=15 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the last decade of his life, Fulci suffered from emotional and physical health problems, reflected by a marked decline in the quality of his work. Fulci also continued to suffer during the late 1980s from reccurring problems with diabetes and his liver. He hid the severity of his illness from his friends and associates, so that he would not be deemed unemployable{{sfn|Thrower|1999}}. His wife's suicide in 1969 had always weighed heavily on him (his wife Marina had killed herself with a gas oven after learning she had inoperable cancer).{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=46}} People who knew Fulci well spoke of a third daughter he once had who he said was killed in a car accident in the 1970s, but this story was never confirmed, and the daughter's name (if in fact she existed) was never revealed by any of his biographers.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=46}} Fulci biographer Stephen Thrower wrote \"....the suicide of his wife in 1969 was followed not long after by the death of a daughter in a road accident.\" {{sfn|Thrower|1999|p=267}} Dario Argento is quoted in one book as saying of Fulci \"His life was terrible. His wife committed suicide, and his daughter was paralyzed because of an accident.\"{{sfn|Thrower|1999|p=268}}\n\nBetween 1988 and 1989, Fulci made a deal with producers Antonio Lucidi and Luigi Nannerini to lend his name to the credits of some of their low-budget horror films that he had not even worked on, simply to make the films more marketable to foreign distributors.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=343}} Although he did supervise the special gore effects in ''The Murder Secret'', and directed some additional footage to lengthen the running time of ''Hansel and Gretel'', he was hardly at all involved with some of the other projects which nonetheless bore the \"Lucio Fulci Presents\" label on their video display boxes.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=343}} The following year, in reciprocation for the use of his name, Fulci was permitted to use gore footage culled from these various films to make his infamous ''[[A Cat in the Brain]]''. Fulci tried unsuccessfully however to have his name removed from the credits of one film in particular, Gianni Martucci's ''[[The Red Monks]]'', since he said he had had no involvement whatsoever with the project (the film's producer Pino Buricchi begged him to let them put his name in the credits).{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=344}}\n\nIt could be argued that at his peak, Fulci's fame and popularity were on a par with that of [[Dario Argento]], another famous Italian horror film director whom Fulci had avoided working with as a result of Fulci's publicly criticizing Argento from time to time. Fulci was most likely resentful of Argento since Argento had always received critical acclaim and recognition in Italy and abroad, whereas Fulci had been regarded in his home country as something of a horror film \"hack\".{{sfn|Thrower|1999}} Fulci always joked that when he died, the Italian newspapers would all misspell his name, if they even mentioned him at all.\n\nFulci and Argento met in 1994 at the Rome Fanta Festival and surprisingly agreed to collaborate on a horror film called ''[[The Wax Mask]]'', a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price horror classic ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'', also based on a story called \"The Waxwork Museum\" by Gaston Leroux.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=65}} Argento claimed he had heard about Fulci's miserable circumstances at the time and wanted to offer him a chance at a comeback. It is said that Argento was shocked at how thin and sickly Fulci appeared at their 1994 meeting, and said he felt very sorry for him.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=65}}\n\nFulci collaborated with writer Daniele Stroppa to create a screenplay for Argento, and Argento kept trying to get them to increase the violence and gore quotient, against Fulci's wishes strangely. (Stroppa had co-written two of Fulci's earlier films, ''[[The House of Clocks]]'' and ''Voices from Beyond''). Fulci was slated to also direct the film, but sadly he died before filming could begin, due to a series of delays caused by Argento's involvement with his own project, ''[[The Stendhal Syndrome]]'', at the time. ''[[Wax Mask]]'' was eventually directed by former special effects artist [[Sergio Stivaletti]].{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=11}} The screenplay was entirely reworked by Stivaletti after Fulci's death, so the finished film contains significant changes to Fulci's original screenplay. Argento also hired Fulci's daughter Antonella to serve as an assistant art director on the film.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=66}}\n\nLucio Fulci died alone, in his sleep, in his apartment in Rome at around 2 P.M. on the afternoon of 13 March 1996, from diabetes-related complications at the age of 68. Toward the end of his life, Fulci had lost his house and was forced to move into a cramped apartment. Since Fulci had been so despondent in his later years, some believed that he may have intentionally allowed himself to die by not taking his diabetes medication, but this is controversial.<ref>Balun, Charles (1997). Lucio Fulci: Beyond the Gates (2nd ed.). Fantasma Books.</ref> Dario Argento paid for Fulci's funeral arrangements.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=347}}\n\nFulci's films had remained generally ignored or dismissed for many years by the mainstream critics, who regarded his work as [[exploitation film|exploitation]]. However, [[genre]] fans appreciated his films as being stylish exercises in extreme gore. At least one of his films, ''The Beyond'', has \"amassed a large and dedicated following\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Kay |first=Glenn |title=Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide |publisher=Chicago Review Press |year=2008 |page=113 |isbn=1-55652-770-5}}</ref> In 1998, ''The Beyond'' was re-released to theaters by [[Quentin Tarantino]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvddrive-in.com/features/beyondpiecespromo.htm |title=Grindhouse Releasing Presents '80s Horror Classics Pieces and The Beyond |work=DVD Drive-In |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> who has often cited the film, and Fulci himself, as a major source of inspiration. Fulci's earlier, lesser-known giallo ''Don't Torture a Duckling'' (1972) received some critical acclaim as well. Fulci regarded two of his films, ''Don't Torture a Duckling'' and ''Beatrice Cenci'', as his best all-around work, and considered both ''[[Zombi 2]]'' and ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' as the two films that forever catapulted him to cult film stardom. His daughter Camilla served as an assistant director on his last five films (from 1989-1991) and has gone on to become an assistant director in the Italian film industry.\n\nFulci made an appearance at the January 1996 [[Fangoria]] Horror Convention in New York City, two months before his death. Walking on crutches with a bandaged foot, he told attendees that he had had no idea his films were so popular outside of his native Italy, as hordes of starstruck gore fans braved blizzard conditions that weekend to meet him.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=345}}\n\n== Fulci vs. Sacchetti ==\nFulci and screenwriter [[Dardano Sacchetti]] share many screen credits from 1977 to 1983. Indeed, most of Fulci's most celebrated horror films were written by Sacchetti. After collaborating with Sacchetti for six years, Fulci went off on his own in 1983 to direct ''[[Conquest (1983 film)|Conquest]]'' in Mexico, failing to involve Sacchetti in the deal. The film was supposed to be a high budget production, and Sacchetti allegedly resented the fact that Fulci had not thought to involve him in the project. The film actually wound up doing quite poorly upon its release, and afterwards, Fulci had trouble jump-starting his working relationship with Sacchetti, who by this time had gone his own way.\n\nIn 1987, Fulci accused Sacchetti of stealing a story idea of his, a project which they were planning to do together in 1983 after Fulci returned from Mexico. He claimed that Sacchetti later allowed director [[Lamberto Bava]] to direct the project (under the title ''Per Sempre'' / ''Until Death'') in 1987 without Fulci's knowledge that the film was even being made. Luca M. Palmerini and Gaetano Mistretta's book ''Spaghetti Nightmares'', publishes two full interviews, one with Fulci and one with Sacchetti, explaining the reasons for the fallout.\n\nFulci's version is as follows: \"One day I told Dardano the plot of my ''Evil Comes Back'' (later retitled ''Per Sempre''/''Until Death''), a sequel on a fantastic note to ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'', and he proposed it to several producers with my name on it as the director. Then, one day, he registered the screenplay with ''his'' name on it! ''(laughs)'' I later found out that he'd sold the story idea to a producer ([[Sergio Martino]]), but, in view of our past friendship, I decided not to sue him. I just broke off all relations with him. He is indeed a very good scriptwriter though.\"\n\nSacchetti's version differs: \"When I proposed to Lucio my original treatment for ''Per Sempre'', which was nothing more than a sequel to ''The Postman Always Rings Twice'' in which a dead man returns to life, he became really enthusiastic and had my story read by a producer friend of his who then commissioned me to write a finished script. At that time, Fulci assumed that he would direct it. Later, for various reasons, problems arose and the film was never made. Four years later, (Lamberto) Bava used my script to make ''[[The Changeling 2|Per Sempre]]'' and Fulci, who was not working much at the time, got angry with me and started hurling these accusations. It's one thing for him to say that we were originally supposed to make the film together, but to claim that ''he'' originated the story and that I ''stole'' it from him is pure science fiction\".\n\n== Filmography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Film\n! colspan=\"3\"|Worked as\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"250\"|Notes\n|-\n! width=95 |[[Film director|Director]]\n! width=95 |[[Screenwriter|Writer]]\n! width=95 |[[Actor]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"center\"| 1950\n| align=\"left\"| [[The Last Days of Pompeii (1950 film)|''The Last Days of Pompeii'' (1950 film)]] \n|{{yes}} (2nd unit director)\n|\n| \n| Italian: ''Gli ultimi giorni di Pompei''{{sfn|Thrower|1999|p=282}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| rowspan=4 align=\"center\"| 1952\n| align=\"left\"| ''Tot\u00f2 a colori''\n| {{yes}} (assistant director)\n| {{yes}} (co-writer)\n|\n| English: ''Tot\u00f2 In Color''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\"| ''Tot\u00f2 e i Re di Roma''\n| {{yes}} (assistant director)\n|\n|\n| English: ''Tot\u00f2 and the King of Rome''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\"| ''Fratelli d'Italia''\n| {{yes}} (assistant director)\n| {{yes}} (co-writer)\n|\n| English: ''Brothers of Italy''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\"| ''Tot\u00f2 e le donne''\n| {{yes}} (assistant director)\n| \n|\n| English: ''Tot\u00f2 and the Lady''<ref>Thrower, Stephen (1999).

His most notable films include the \"Gates of Hell\" trilogy\u2014''[[City of the Living Dead]]'' (1980), ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' (1981), and ''[[The House by the Cemetery]]'' (1981)\u2014as well as ''[[Massacre Time]]'' (1966), ''[[One on Top of the Other]]'' (1969), ''[[A Lizard in a Woman's Skin]]'' (1971), ''[[Don't Torture a Duckling]]'' (1972), ''[[White Fang (1973 film)|White Fang]]'' (1973), ''[[Four of the Apocalypse]]'' (1975), ''[[Sette note in nero]]'' (1977), ''[[Zombi 2]]'' (1979), ''[[The Beyond]]'' (1981), ''[[The New York Ripper]]''(1982), and ''[[A Cat in the Brain]]'' (1990). Although a number of films over the years were said to have been \"co-produced\" by Fulci, in most cases he was just allowing them to use his name to promote the films (with the exception of ''City of the Living Dead'', which he did actively attempt to obtain funding for)<ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press. page 202.</ref>.\n\nBecause of the high level of visceral [[Splatter film|graphic violence]] present in many of his films, especially ''Zombi 2'', ''The Beyond'' and ''The New York Ripper'', Fulci is frequently referred to as \"The Godfather of Gore\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houseofhorrors.com/fulci.htm|title=Lucio Fulci: Godfather of Gore|work=houseofhorrors.com|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> a title also given to [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]].\n\n==Life and career==\nLucio Fulci was born in Trastavere, [[Rome]] on 17 June 1927. His mother Lucia was from a very poor but reputable [[Sicilians|Sicilian]], politically anti-fascist family, from [[Messina]], [[Sicily]]. She had earlier eloped to Rome with a lover who later left her to raise their child (Lucio) alone. Lucio was raised by his mother and a female housekeeper. He attended the Naval College in Venice, and near the end of WW2, completed his studies back in Rome at the [[Giulio Cesare State Classical School]]. He was interested in art, music, film, soccer and always had a love for sailing.<ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films.

He was in his young adult years a politically active radical for the [[Italian Communist Party]]. Fulci was even arrested by the police for demonstrating with the Communist Party. An assassination attempt on party leader Palmiro Togliatti caused a political crisis in Italy and calls for a general strike. After this incident, his relationship with his family became tense and chaotic and he lived an impoverished life for a time. \n\nHis mother encouraged him to be a lawyer, but he wound up going to medical school instead.<ref>Paolo Albiero & Giacomo Cacciatore: \"Dalla sinistra di via Veneto alla destra di Steno\" (1927-1958)</ref> <ref name=FC1 /><ref name=AD2 /><ref name=LAZ3 /> After studying medicine in college and qualifying as a doctor, he decided there was more money to be had in the film industry. He worked initially as an art critic, writing for Gazzetta delle Arti and Il Messaggero, and also joined the critical art group il Gruppo Arte Sociale.<ref name=FC1 /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2004/great-directors/fulci|title=Lucio Fulci|last=MacCormack|first=Patricia|date=22 April 2004|work=[[Senses of Cinema]]|accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> \n\nHis interest in the arts led him to apply to the Centro Sperimentale (Rome's film school) where he apprenticed, after which he worked first as a director of documentaries, then an assistant director of motion pictures, then a screenwriter working mainly in the Italian [[comedy film|comedy]] field In the early 1950s. The famed Italian director [[Steno]] took Fulci under his wing and allowed him to assist in the making of a number of comedies starring [[Tot\u00f2]]<ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press.</ref>. Fulci finally became a full-fledged movie director beginning with ''I Ladri'' in 1959. \n\nIn the 1960s, Fulci wrote or directed more than 30 Italian comedies<ref>Filmography section</ref>, eleven of them starring the famous Italian comedian team of [[Franco Franchi]] and [[Ciccio Ingrassia]]. Most of these early comedies did not enjoy distribution in English-speaking markets, and are thus generally unavailable today in English. Fulci's first film to be distributed theatrically in the USA was ''Oh! Those Most Secret Agents!'' in 1965. Only three of his other 1960s films were ever released in the U.S.: ''Massacre Time'' (released as ''[[The Brute and the Beast]]'' in 1968), ''[[Una sull'altra]]'' (as ''[[One on Top of the Other]]'' in 1973) and ''Beatrice Cenci'' (as ''[[Conspiracy of Torture]]'', in 1976).\n\nFulci moved into directing [[giallo]] thrillers with ''[[Una sull'altra]]'' (1969), ''[[A Lizard in a Woman's Skin]]'' (1971) and ''[[Sette note in nero]]'' (''The Psychic'', 1977), as well as Spaghetti Westerns such as ''[[Four of the Apocalypse]]'' (1975) and ''[[Silver Saddle]]'' (1978), all of which were commercially successful and controversial in their depictions of graphic violence.  Some of the [[special effects]] in ''A Lizard in a Woman's Skin'' involving mutilated dogs in a vivisection room were so realistic that Fulci was dragged into court and charged with animal cruelty until he produced the artificial canine puppets that were used in the film (created by special effects maestro [[Carlo Rambaldi]]).<ref name=FC1 /><ref name=AD2 /><ref name=LAZ3 />\n\nHis first film to gain significant notoriety in his native country, ''[[Don't Torture a Duckling]]'' (1972), combined scathing social commentary with the director's trademark graphic violence. Fulci had a [[Catholic]] upbringing and always referred to himself as a Catholic.<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 1982 |title=<nowiki>[Lucio Fulci interview]</nowiki> |magazine=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]] |issue=48 |url=http://www.shockingimages.com/fulci/interview2.html |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> Despite this, some of his movies (''Beatrice Cenci'', ''Don't Torture a Duckling'', ''City of the Living Dead'', etc.) have been viewed as having very anti-Catholic sentiment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://landmarkafterdark.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=252&Itemid=211 |title=Atmosfear \u2013 20 Must-see Italian Horror films (1957-1987) PART III |work=landmarkafterdark.com |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> In one of his films, a priest is depicted as a serial child killer, while in another film, a priest commits suicide by hanging himself in a cemetery and is later reincarnated as a demon.\n\nIn 1979, he achieved his international breakthrough with ''[[Zombi 2]]'', a violent [[zombie]] film that was marketed in European territories as a sequel to [[George A. Romero|George Romero]]'s ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]''/ ''Zombi'' (1978).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/159439-legacy-of-the-living-dead/ |title=The Zombification Family Tree: Legacy of the Living Dead |last=Ma\u00e7ek III |first=J. C. |date=15 June 2012 |work=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> He followed it up with several other horror films, also featuring zombies, which were popular horror film trope of the time. His features released from 1979 through 1982 (most of them scripted by famed Italian screenwriter [[Dardano Sacchetti]]) were described by some critics as being among the most violent and gory films ever made. ''[[City of the Living Dead]]'' (1980), ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' (1981), ''[[The House by the Cemetery]]'' (1981), ''[[The Black Cat (1981 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1981), ''[[The New York Ripper]]'' (1982) and ''[[Manhattan Baby]]'' (1982) were among his biggest hits, all of which were noted for their extreme content and significant amount of gore. Fulci also enjoyed acting, and indulged himself by giving himself cameo appearances in sixteen of the films he directed between 1967 and 1991.(See Filmography below). He also appeared in a cameo in a 1961 rock and roll film ''Sanremo - la Grande Sfida'' which he did not direct, and was featured on the film's one-sheet poster as well.<ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press. Filmography section</ref>\n\nSeveral of Fulci's movies released in America were edited by the [[film distributor]] to ensure an [[MPAA film rating system|R rating]], such as ''The Beyond'', which was originally released on video in severely edited form as ''Seven Doors of Death''. Others were released Unrated in order to avoid an [[X-rating]] (as with ''Zombi 2'' and ''House by the Cemetery'') which would have restricted the films' target audiences to adults. The unrated films often played worldwide in [[drive-in theater|drive-ins]] and [[grindhouse]]s where they developed a cult following. Many of Fulci's horror films tend to contain \"injury to the eye\" sequences, in which a character's eyeball is either pierced or pulled out of its socket, usually in lingering, close-up detail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/3261090|title=No Eyes are Safe: Lucio Fulci|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of Fulci's movies were prohibited in Europe or were released in heavily cut versions. Of the original 72 films on the infamous [[video nasty]] list in the United Kingdom, three belonged to Fulci: ''Zombi 2'' (1979), ''The Beyond'' (1981), and ''House by the Cemetery'' (1981). After viewing Fulci's ''The New York Ripper'', not only did the [[British Board of Film Classification]] refuse the film a certificate, but every single print in the country was taken to an airport and returned to Italy by order of [[James Ferman]]; it was not until later that [[VIPCO]] allowed the release of the film, initially outsourcing production to a foreign source under police supervision before releasing a [[VHS]] in 2002 and a [[DVD]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084719/trivia |title=The New York Ripper (1982) - Trivia |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter collaborating with screenwriter Sacchetti for six years, Fulci went off on his own in 1983 to direct the movie ''[[Conquest (1983 film)|Conquest]]''  (a Conan-like barbarian fantasy) in [[Mexico]], failing to involve Sacchetti in the deal. The film did poorly upon its release, and afterwards, Fulci had trouble jump-starting his working relationship with Sacchetti, who by that time had gone his own way.\n\nFulci became ill from hepatitis in 1984, right after he finished directing ''[[Murder Rock]]'' in New York City, and had to be hospitalized in Italy for many months. Fulci spent most of 1984 hospitalized with [[cirrhosis]], and much of 1985 recuperating at home. After 1986, with diabetes plaguing him and the departure of screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti from his circle of friends, Fulci's endeavors as a director suffered. \n\nIn 1988, he had directed about two-thirds of ''[[Zombi 3]]'' in the [[Philippines]] before having to return abruptly to Italy due to a second bout of hepatitis. The film was finished by an uncredited [[Bruno Mattei]]. Fulci later said that he hated the finished film and tried unsuccessfully to get his name removed from the credits. Mattei has said in interviews that the film was Fulci's, and that he (Mattei) just added a few extra scenes to pad out the running time.{{sfn|Thrower|1999}}\n\nIn 1989, Fulci was hired to direct a pair of made-for-TV horror movies for the Italian market, neither of which aired in Italy due to the high amount of gore and violence. They were released later on DVD, however, outside of Italy. Fulci's intended comeback films ''[[Demonia (film)|Demonia]]'' and ''[[A Cat in the Brain]]'' were produced in 1990. Both films struggled to get released and were considered critical disappointments. His final project, the 1991 psychological thriller ''[[The Door to Silence]]'', based on one of his own short stories, also received poor reviews. The release of this film is seen by some as the critical lowest point of his career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esplatter.com/reviews.php?id=22 |title=Horror Movie Review of Zombi 3 (Lucio Fulci) |last=Gore |first=Lucius |work=ESplatter |access-date=15 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the last decade of his life, Fulci suffered from emotional and physical health problems, reflected by a marked decline in the quality of his work. Fulci also continued to suffer during the late 1980s from reccurring problems with diabetes and his liver. He hid the severity of his illness from his friends and associates, so that he would not be deemed unemployable{{sfn|Thrower|1999}}. His wife's suicide in 1969 had always weighed heavily on him (his wife Marina had killed herself with a gas oven after learning she had inoperable cancer).{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=46}} People who knew Fulci well spoke of a third daughter he once had who he said was killed in a car accident in the 1970s, but this story was never confirmed, and the daughter's name (if in fact she existed) was never revealed by any of his biographers.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=46}} Fulci biographer Stephen Thrower wrote \"....the suicide of his wife in 1969 was followed not long after by the death of a daughter in a road accident.\" {{sfn|Thrower|1999|p=267}} Dario Argento is quoted in one book as saying of Fulci \"His life was terrible. His wife committed suicide, and his daughter was paralyzed because of an accident.\"{{sfn|Thrower|1999|p=268}}\n\nBetween 1988 and 1989, Fulci made a deal with producers Antonio Lucidi and Luigi Nannerini to lend his name to the credits of some of their low-budget horror films that he had not even worked on, simply to make the films more marketable to foreign distributors.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=343}} Although he did supervise the special gore effects in ''The Murder Secret'', and directed some additional footage to lengthen the running time of ''Hansel and Gretel'', he was hardly at all involved with some of the other projects which nonetheless bore the \"Lucio Fulci Presents\" label on their video display boxes.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=343}} The following year, in reciprocation for the use of his name, Fulci was permitted to use gore footage culled from these various films to make his infamous ''[[A Cat in the Brain]]''. Fulci tried unsuccessfully however to have his name removed from the credits of one film in particular, Gianni Martucci's ''[[The Red Monks]]'', since he said he had had no involvement whatsoever with the project (the film's producer Pino Buricchi begged him to let them put his name in the credits).{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=344}}\n\nIt could be argued that at his peak, Fulci's fame and popularity were on a par with that of [[Dario Argento]], another famous Italian horror film director whom Fulci had avoided working with as a result of Fulci's publicly criticizing Argento from time to time. Fulci was most likely resentful of Argento since Argento had always received critical acclaim and recognition in Italy and abroad, whereas Fulci had been regarded in his home country as something of a horror film \"hack\".{{sfn|Thrower|1999}} Fulci always joked that when he died, the Italian newspapers would all misspell his name, if they even mentioned him at all.\n\nFulci and Argento met in 1994 at the Rome Fanta Festival and surprisingly agreed to collaborate on a horror film called ''[[The Wax Mask]]'', a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price horror classic ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'', also based on a story called \"The Waxwork Museum\" by Gaston Leroux.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=65}} Argento claimed he had heard about Fulci's miserable circumstances at the time and wanted to offer him a chance at a comeback. It is said that Argento was shocked at how thin and sickly Fulci appeared at their 1994 meeting, and said he felt very sorry for him.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=65}}\n\nFulci collaborated with writer Daniele Stroppa to create a screenplay for Argento, and Argento kept trying to get them to increase the violence and gore quotient, against Fulci's wishes strangely. (Stroppa had co-written two of Fulci's earlier films, ''[[The House of Clocks]]'' and ''Voices from Beyond''). Fulci was slated to also direct the film, but sadly he died before filming could begin, due to a series of delays caused by Argento's involvement with his own project, ''[[The Stendhal Syndrome]]'', at the time. ''[[Wax Mask]]'' was eventually directed by former special effects artist [[Sergio Stivaletti]].{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=11}} The screenplay was entirely reworked by Stivaletti after Fulci's death, so the finished film contains significant changes to Fulci's original screenplay. Argento also hired Fulci's daughter Antonella to serve as an assistant art director on the film.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=66}}\n\nLucio Fulci died alone, in his sleep, in his apartment in Rome at around 2 P.M. on the afternoon of 13 March 1996, from diabetes-related complications at the age of 68. Toward the end of his life, Fulci had lost his house and was forced to move into a cramped apartment. Since Fulci had been so despondent in his later years, some believed that he may have intentionally allowed himself to die by not taking his diabetes medication, but this is controversial.<ref>Balun, Charles (1997). Lucio Fulci: Beyond the Gates (2nd ed.). Fantasma Books.</ref> Dario Argento paid for Fulci's funeral arrangements.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=347}}\n\nFulci's films had remained generally ignored or dismissed for many years by the mainstream critics, who regarded his work as [[exploitation film|exploitation]]. However, [[genre]] fans appreciated his films as being stylish exercises in extreme gore. At least one of his films, ''The Beyond'', has \"amassed a large and dedicated following\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Kay |first=Glenn |title=Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide |publisher=Chicago Review Press |year=2008 |page=113 |isbn=1-55652-770-5}}</ref> In 1998, ''The Beyond'' was re-released to theaters by [[Quentin Tarantino]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvddrive-in.com/features/beyondpiecespromo.htm |title=Grindhouse Releasing Presents '80s Horror Classics Pieces and The Beyond |work=DVD Drive-In |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> who has often cited the film, and Fulci himself, as a major source of inspiration. Fulci's earlier, lesser-known giallo ''Don't Torture a Duckling'' (1972) received some critical acclaim as well. Fulci regarded two of his films, ''Don't Torture a Duckling'' and ''Beatrice Cenci'', as his best all-around work, and considered both ''[[Zombi 2]]'' and ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' as the two films that forever catapulted him to cult film stardom. His daughter Camilla served as an assistant director on his last five films (from 1989-1991) and has gone on to become an assistant director in the Italian film industry.\n\nFulci made an appearance at the January 1996 [[Fangoria]] Horror Convention in New York City, two months before his death. Walking on crutches with a bandaged foot, he told attendees that he had had no idea his films were so popular outside of his native Italy, as hordes of starstruck gore fans braved blizzard conditions that weekend to meet him.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=345}}\n\n== Fulci vs. Sacchetti ==\nFulci and screenwriter [[Dardano Sacchetti]] share many screen credits from 1977 to 1983. Indeed, most of Fulci's most celebrated horror films were written by Sacchetti. After collaborating with Sacchetti for six years, Fulci went off on his own in 1983 to direct ''[[Conquest (1983 film)|Conquest]]'' in Mexico, failing to involve Sacchetti in the deal. The film was supposed to be a high budget production, and Sacchetti allegedly resented the fact that Fulci had not thought to involve him in the project. The film actually wound up doing quite poorly upon its release, and afterwards, Fulci had trouble jump-starting his working relationship with Sacchetti, who by this time had gone his own way.\n\nIn 1987, Fulci accused Sacchetti of stealing a story idea of his, a project which they were planning to do together in 1983 after Fulci returned from Mexico. He claimed that Sacchetti later allowed director [[Lamberto Bava]] to direct the project (under the title ''Per Sempre'' / ''Until Death'') in 1987 without Fulci's knowledge that the film was even being made. Luca M. Palmerini and Gaetano Mistretta's book ''Spaghetti Nightmares'', publishes two full interviews, one with Fulci and one with Sacchetti, explaining the reasons for the fallout.\n\nFulci's version is as follows: \"One day I told Dardano the plot of my ''Evil Comes Back'' (later retitled ''Per Sempre''/''Until Death''), a sequel on a fantastic note to ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'', and he proposed it to several producers with my name on it as the director. Then, one day, he registered the screenplay with ''his'' name on it! ''(laughs)'' I later found out that he'd sold the story idea to a producer ([[Sergio Martino]]), but, in view of our past friendship, I decided not to sue him. I just broke off all relations with him. He is indeed a very good scriptwriter though.\"\n\nSacchetti's version differs: \"When I proposed to Lucio my original treatment for ''Per Sempre'', which was nothing more than a sequel to ''The Postman Always Rings Twice'' in which a dead man returns to life, he became really enthusiastic and had my story read by a producer friend of his who then commissioned me to write a finished script. At that time, Fulci assumed that he would direct it. Later, for various reasons, problems arose and the film was never made. Four years later, (Lamberto) Bava used my script to make ''[[The Changeling 2|Per Sempre]]'' and Fulci, who was not working much at the time, got angry with me and started hurling these accusations. It's one thing for him to say that we were originally supposed to make the film together, but to claim that ''he'' originated the story and that I ''stole'' it from him is pure science fiction\".\n\n== Filmography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Film\n! colspan=\"3\"|Worked as\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"250\"|Notes\n|-\n! width=95 |[[Film director|Director]]\n! width=95 |[[Screenwriter|Writer]]\n! width=95 |[[Actor]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"center\"| 1950\n| align=\"left\"| [[The Last Days of Pompeii (1950 film)|''The Last Days of Pompeii'' (1950 film)]] \n|{{yes}} (2nd unit director)\n|\n| \n| Italian: ''Gli ultimi giorni di Pompei''{{sfn|Thrower|1999|p=282}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| rowspan=4 align=\"center\"| 1952\n| align=\"left\"| ''Tot\u00f2 a colori''\n| {{yes}} (assistant director)\n| {{yes}} (co-writer)\n|\n| English: ''Tot\u00f2 In Color''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\"| ''Tot\u00f2 e i Re di Roma''\n| {{yes}} (assistant director)\n|\n|\n| English: ''Tot\u00f2 and the King of Rome''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\"| ''Fratelli d'Italia''\n| {{yes}} (assistant director)\n| {{yes}} (co-writer)\n|\n| English: ''Brothers of Italy''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\"| ''Tot\u00f2 e le donne''\n| {{yes}} (assistant director)\n| \n|\n| English: ''Tot\u00f2 and the Lady''<ref>Thrower, Stephen (1999).
