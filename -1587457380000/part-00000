That failure led to the suffering and often irreparable harm to children, their families and the wider community. That harm could have been avoided if the Church had acted in the interests of children rather than in its own interests.</blockquote><blockquote>Euphemistic and elliptical language was often used in correspondence and minutes to mask the true nature of the conduct discussed. There was repeated reference to \u2018pressures\u2019, \u2018strains\u2019 and unspecified \u2018problems\u2019. On occasions, records were deliberately not made or kept or were destroyed.</blockquote><blockquote>The result of these inexcusable failures was that more children were sexually abused by Catholic clergy in the Diocese. There was a catastrophic institutional failure which resulted in many children being sexually abused. We heard about the devastating, often lifelong, consequences in the lives of those children. The welfare of children was not the primary concern of Bishop Mulkearns and other senior members of the Diocese when responding to complaints and allegation of child sexual abuse against their priests. There is no doubt it should have been.<ref name=\"Gemma.Choy\"/></blockquote>The report on Ballarat also described the impact it had on victims. One section outlines suicide and premature death caused from the abuse. One victim said<blockquote>Newspapers don\u2019t report suicides, so the public doesn\u2019t hear about the broken families and their shattered lives, about the unseen impact of institutional child sexual abuse. Children are left behind and they don't understand why. It doesn't end when the abuse ends.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/sites/default/files/case_study_28_-_findings_report_-_catholic_church_authorities_in_ballarat_catholic_church_authorities_in_ballarat2.pdf|title=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse: Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat - Report of Case Study No. 28|website=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse|pages=433\u2013436}}</ref></blockquote>Other harms are outlined. Another victim outlines the general harm in the Ballarat community:<blockquote>Such chronic sexual abuse in the Ballarat community has led to a large number of men who are not able to be productive members of society and in neglect have become either emotional, social or financial burdens upon the community.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>One victim who told their story to the Royal Commission

That failure led to the suffering and often irreparable harm to children, their families and the wider community. That harm could have been avoided if the Church had acted in the interests of children rather than in its own interests.</blockquote><blockquote>Euphemistic and elliptical language was often used in correspondence and minutes to mask the true nature of the conduct discussed. There was repeated reference to \u2018pressures\u2019, \u2018strains\u2019 and unspecified \u2018problems\u2019. On occasions, records were deliberately not made or kept or were destroyed.</blockquote><blockquote>The result of these inexcusable failures was that more children were sexually abused by Catholic clergy in the Diocese. There was a catastrophic institutional failure which resulted in many children being sexually abused. We heard about the devastating, often lifelong, consequences in the lives of those children. The welfare of children was not the primary concern of Bishop Mulkearns and other senior members of the Diocese when responding to complaints and allegation of child sexual abuse against their priests. There is no doubt it should have been.<ref name=\"Gemma.Choy\"/></blockquote>The report on Ballarat also described the impact it had on victims. One section outlines suicide and premature death caused from the abuse. One victim said<blockquote>Newspapers don\u2019t report suicides, so the public doesn\u2019t hear about the broken families and their shattered lives, about the unseen impact of institutional child sexual abuse. Children are left behind and they don't understand why. It doesn't end when the abuse ends.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/sites/default/files/case_study_28_-_findings_report_-_catholic_church_authorities_in_ballarat_catholic_church_authorities_in_ballarat2.pdf|title=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse: Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat - Report of Case Study No. 28|website=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse|pages=433\u2013436}}</ref></blockquote>Other harms are outlined. Another victim outlines the general harm in the Ballarat community:<blockquote>Such chronic sexual abuse in the Ballarat community has led to a large number of men who are not able to be productive members of society and in neglect have become either emotional, social or financial burdens upon the community.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>One victim who told their story to the Royal Commission

According to legend, kissing the stone endows the kisser with ''the [[wikt:gift of the gab|gift of the gab]]'' (great [[eloquence]] or skill at [[flattery]]). The stone was set into a tower of the castle in 1446. The castle is a popular tourist site in Ireland, attracting visitors from all over the world to kiss the stone and tour the castle and its gardens.\n\nThe word ''[[wikt:blarney|blarney]]'' has come to mean \"clever, flattering, or coaxing talk\". Irish politician [[John O'Connor Power]] defined it this way: \"Blarney is something more than mere flattery. It is flattery sweetened by humour and flavoured by wit. Those who mix with Irish folk have many examples of it in their everyday experience.\"<ref>'Irish Wit and Humour', John O'Connor Power, Time, 1890, p. 178.</ref> [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] described its contemporary meaning in an article entitled 'Blarney Castle' in 1832\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Blarney Stone from below.jpg|thumb|View of the Blarney Stone from the ground]]\nA number of stories attempt to explain the origin of the stone and surrounding legend. An early story involves the goddess [[Cl\u00edodhna]].<ref>James MacKillop, ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology''. Oxford. pp. 43\u201344, 91</ref><ref>Patricia Monaghan, ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore''. New land fucts On File. 2004. pp. 48, 91</ref> Cormac Laidir McCarthy, the builder of Blarney Castle,<ref>[http://www.libraryireland.com/Pedigrees1/MacCarthyMuskry.php Irish Pedigrees: MacCarthy, Lords of Muskry] #119</ref> being involved in a lawsuit in the 15th century, appealed to Cl\u00edodhna for her assistance. She told McCarthy to kiss the first stone he found in the morning on his way to court, and he did so, with the result that he pleaded his case with great eloquence and won. Thus the Blarney Stone is said to impart \"the ability to deceive without offending\". MacCarthy then incorporated it into the [[parapet]] of the castle.<ref>Richard Marsh, Elan Penn, Frank McCourt, ''The Legends & Lands of Ireland''. Penn Publishing. pp. 107\u2013110</ref>\n\nThe proprietors of Blarney Castle list several other explanations of the origins of the stone on their website.<ref name=BlarneyCastle>{{cite web |url=http://www.blarneycastle.ie/pages/stone |title=The Blarney Stone |work=Blarney Castle website |accessdate=11 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830230658/http://www.blarneycastle.ie/pages/stone |archivedate=30 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Many of these suppose that the stone had previously been in Ireland, was taken to Scotland and then returned to Ireland in 1314.<ref name=BlarneyCastle/> The stories listed include one suggesting that the stone was presented to Cormac McCarthy by [[Robert the Bruce]] in 1314 in recognition of his support in the [[Battle of Bannockburn]].<ref name=BlarneyCastle/> This legend holds that this was a piece of the [[Stone of Scone]] and was installed at McCarthy's castle of Blarney.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Castleden |first1=Rodney |title=Castles of the celtic lands: the historic castles of Ireland, Scotland and Wales |year=2006 |publisher=Barnes & Noble |isbn=0-7607-7937-6 |page=26}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Varner |first1=Gary R. |title=Menhirs, dolmen, and circles of stone: the folklore and magic of sacred stone |year=2004 |publisher=Algora Publishing |isbn=0-87586-349-3 |page=61}}</ref> Although colourful, this folk legend does not account for the fact that it supposes that the stone was removed from Scotland 18 years before Bannockburn. Moreover, analysis by geologists at the University of Glasgow in 2014 found the stone's geochemical signature matches local limestone.<ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\n==Ritual==\n[[File:Kiss the Blarney Stone.jpg|thumb|Person kissing the Blarney Stone]]\nThe ritual of kissing the Blarney Stone, according to the castle's proprietors, has been performed by \"millions of people\", including \"world statesmen, literary giants [and] legends of the [[silver screen]]\".<ref name=BlarneyCastle/> The kiss, however, is not casually achieved.

According to legend, kissing the stone endows the kisser with ''the [[wikt:gift of the gab|gift of the gab]]'' (great [[eloquence]] or skill at [[flattery]]). The stone was set into a tower of the castle in 1446. The castle is a popular tourist site in Ireland, attracting visitors from all over the world to kiss the stone and tour the castle and its gardens.\n\nThe word ''[[wikt:blarney|blarney]]'' has come to mean \"clever, flattering, or coaxing talk\". Irish politician [[John O'Connor Power]] defined it this way: \"Blarney is something more than mere flattery. It is flattery sweetened by humour and flavoured by wit. Those who mix with Irish folk have many examples of it in their everyday experience.\"<ref>'Irish Wit and Humour', John O'Connor Power, Time, 1890, p. 178.</ref> [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] described its contemporary meaning in an article entitled 'Blarney Castle' in 1832\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Blarney Stone from below.jpg|thumb|View of the Blarney Stone from the ground]]\nA number of stories attempt to explain the origin of the stone and surrounding legend.

Oxford. pp. 43\u201344, 91</ref><ref>Patricia Monaghan, ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore''.

She told McCarthy to kiss the first stone he found in the morning on his way to court, and he did so, with the result that he pleaded his case with great eloquence and won. Thus the Blarney Stone is said to impart \"the ability to deceive without offending\". MacCarthy then incorporated it into the [[parapet]] of the castle.<ref>Richard Marsh, Elan Penn, Frank McCourt, ''The Legends & Lands of Ireland''. Penn Publishing. pp. 107\u2013110</ref>\n\nThe proprietors of Blarney Castle list several other explanations of the origins of the stone on their website.<ref name=BlarneyCastle>{{cite web |url=http://www.blarneycastle.ie/pages/stone |title=The Blarney Stone |work=Blarney Castle website |accessdate=11 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830230658/http://www.blarneycastle.ie/pages/stone |archivedate=30 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Many of these suppose that the stone had previously been in Ireland, was taken to Scotland and then returned to Ireland in 1314.<ref name=BlarneyCastle/> The stories listed include one suggesting that the stone was presented to Cormac McCarthy by [[Robert the Bruce]] in 1314 in recognition of his support in the [[Battle of Bannockburn]].<ref name=BlarneyCastle/> This legend holds that this was a piece of the [[Stone of Scone]] and was installed at McCarthy's castle of Blarney.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Castleden |first1=Rodney |title=Castles of the celtic lands: the historic castles of Ireland, Scotland and Wales |year=2006 |publisher=Barnes & Noble |isbn=0-7607-7937-6 |page=26}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Varner |first1=Gary R. |title=Menhirs, dolmen, and circles of stone: the folklore and magic of sacred stone |year=2004 |publisher=Algora Publishing |isbn=0-87586-349-3 |page=61}}</ref> Although colourful, this folk legend does not account for the fact that it supposes that the stone was removed from Scotland 18 years before Bannockburn.
