Colleges and PPHs are autonomous self-governing [[corporation]]s within the university, and all teaching staff and students studying for a degree at the university must belong to one of the colleges or PPHs. These colleges are not only houses of residence, but have substantial responsibility for teaching undergraduate students. Generally [[tutorial]]s (one of the main methods of teaching in Oxford) and classes are the responsibility of colleges, while lectures, examinations, laboratories, and the central library are run by the university. Most colleges take both graduates and undergraduates, but several are for graduates only.\n\nUndergraduate and graduate students may name preferred colleges in their applications. For undergraduate students, an increasing number of departments practise reallocation to ensure that the ratios between potential students and subject places available at each college are as uniform as possible. For the Department of Physics, reallocation is done on a random basis after a shortlist of candidates is drawn upon and before candidates are invited for interviews at the university.<ref>{{cite web |title=Admissions procedures for Physics courses |url=http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduates/applications/admissions-procedures-for-physics |publisher=The [[University of Oxford]] Department of Physics |access-date=11 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor graduate students, many colleges express a preference for candidates who plan to undertake research in an area of interest of one of its fellows.

Over the centuries several different types of college have emerged and disappeared.\n\n===Monastic Halls===\nThe first academic houses were monastic halls. Of the dozens established during the 12th\u201315th centuries, none survived the [[English Reformation|Reformation]]. The modern [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] permanent private hall of [[Blackfriars, Oxford|Blackfriars]] (1921) is a descendant of the original (1221), and is sometimes described as heir to the oldest tradition of teaching in Oxford.\n\n===Medieval Halls===\nAs the university took shape, friction between the hundreds of students living where and how they pleased led to a decree that all undergraduates would have to reside in approved halls. What eventually put an end to the medieval halls was the emergence of colleges. Often generously endowed and with permanent teaching staff, the colleges were originally the preserve of graduate students. However, once they began accepting fee-paying undergraduates in the 14th century, the halls' days were numbered. Of the hundreds of [[Aularian]] houses (from the Latin for \"hall\") that sprang up, only [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]] (c. 1225) remains.\n\n===Colleges===\nThe oldest colleges are [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]], and [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]], established between 1249 and 1264, although there is some dispute over the exact order and precisely when each began teaching. The fourth oldest college is [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter]], founded in 1314, and the fifth is [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel]], founded in 1326.\n\n===Women's colleges===\nWomen entered the university in 1879, with the opening of [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]] and [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], becoming members of the University (and thus eligible to receive degrees) in 1920. Other women's colleges before integration were [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's]], [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]] and [[St Hugh's College, Oxford|St Hugh's]]. In 1974 the first men's colleges to admit women were [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose]], [[Hertford College, Oxford|Hertford]], [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]], [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's]] and [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham]].<ref name=\"Women_at_Oxford\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about/oxford-people/women-at-oxford |title=Women at Oxford |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |accessdate=12 June 2016}}</ref> By 2008 all colleges had become co-residential, although one of the Permanent Private Halls, [[St Benet's Hall, Oxford|St Benet's Hall]], did not start to admit postgraduate women until [[Michaelmas term]] 2014 and women undergraduates until Michaelmas 2016.\n\n===Postgraduate and mature colleges===\nSome colleges, such as [[Kellogg College, Oxford|Kellogg]], [[Linacre College, Oxford|Linacre]], [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield]], [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's]], [[St Cross College, Oxford|St Cross]] and [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson]] only admit postgraduate students.

Although the university says that the college listings are \"not very significant\", the 2005 table was the first Norrington Table with official data and also probably the first to be accurate. Dame [[Fiona Caldicott]], the Chairman of the Conference of Colleges, said that in previous years some students had used the ''[[Data Protection Act 1998]]'' to ensure their results were not published, rendering the unofficial tables inaccurate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4220284.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Oxford publishes college rankings|date=2005-09-06|accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] ranked first among the 30 Oxford undergraduate colleges in the Norrington table.<ref>http://cherwell.org/2018/08/21/st-johns-tops-2018-norrington-table/</ref>\n\n==College rivalries==\nA tradition of the university is a [[College rivalry|friendly rivalry between colleges]].

Colleges and PPHs are autonomous self-governing [[corporation]]s within the university, and all teaching staff and students studying for a degree at the university must belong to one of the colleges or PPHs. These colleges are not only houses of residence, but have substantial responsibility for teaching undergraduate students. Generally [[tutorial]]s (one of the main methods of teaching in Oxford) and classes are the responsibility of colleges, while lectures, examinations, laboratories, and the central library are run by the university. Most colleges take both graduates and undergraduates, but several are for graduates only.\n\nUndergraduate and graduate students may name preferred colleges in their applications. For undergraduate students, an increasing number of departments practise reallocation to ensure that the ratios between potential students and subject places available at each college are as uniform as possible. For the Department of Physics, reallocation is done on a random basis after a shortlist of candidates is drawn upon and before candidates are invited for interviews at the university.<ref>{{cite web |title=Admissions procedures for Physics courses |url=http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduates/applications/admissions-procedures-for-physics |publisher=The [[University of Oxford]] Department of Physics |access-date=11 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor graduate students, many colleges express a preference for candidates who plan to undertake research in an area of interest of one of its fellows. [[St Hugh's College]], for example, states that it accepts graduate students in most subjects, principally those in the fields of interest of the fellows of the college.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/prospectivestudents/graduate/graduate-courses/ |title=Graduate study at St Hugh's |publisher=[[St Hugh's College]], [[University of Oxford]] |access-date=11 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602122524/http://www.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/prospectivestudents/graduate/graduate-courses/ |archive-date=2 June 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA typical college consists of a [[Formal Hall|hall]] for dining, a chapel, a library, a college bar, [[Senior Common Room|senior]], [[Middle Common Room|middle]] (postgraduate), and [[junior common room]]s, rooms for 200\u2013400 undergraduates as well as lodgings for the head of the college and other [[university dons|dons]].

Over the centuries several different types of college have emerged and disappeared.\n\n===Monastic Halls===\nThe first academic houses were monastic halls. Of the dozens established during the 12th\u201315th centuries, none survived the [[English Reformation|Reformation]]. The modern [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] permanent private hall of [[Blackfriars, Oxford|Blackfriars]] (1921) is a descendant of the original (1221), and is sometimes described as heir to the oldest tradition of teaching in Oxford.\n\n===Medieval Halls===\nAs the university took shape, friction between the hundreds of students living where and how they pleased led to a decree that all undergraduates would have to reside in approved halls. What eventually put an end to the medieval halls was the emergence of colleges. Often generously endowed and with permanent teaching staff, the colleges were originally the preserve of graduate students. However, once they began accepting fee-paying undergraduates in the 14th century, the halls' days were numbered. Of the hundreds of [[Aularian]] houses (from the Latin for \"hall\") that sprang up, only [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]] (c. 1225) remains.\n\n===Colleges===\nThe oldest colleges are [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]], and [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]], established between 1249 and 1264, although there is some dispute over the exact order and precisely when each began teaching. The fourth oldest college is [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter]], founded in 1314, and the fifth is [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel]], founded in 1326.\n\n===Women's colleges===\nWomen entered the university in 1879, with the opening of [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]] and [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], becoming members of the University (and thus eligible to receive degrees) in 1920. Other women's colleges before integration were [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's]], [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]] and [[St Hugh's College, Oxford|St Hugh's]]. In 1974 the first men's colleges to admit women were [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose]], [[Hertford College, Oxford|Hertford]], [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]], [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's]] and [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham]].<ref name=\"Women_at_Oxford\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about/oxford-people/women-at-oxford |title=Women at Oxford |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |accessdate=12 June 2016}}</ref> By 2008 all colleges had become co-residential, although one of the Permanent Private Halls, [[St Benet's Hall, Oxford|St Benet's Hall]], did not start to admit postgraduate women until [[Michaelmas term]] 2014 and women undergraduates until Michaelmas 2016.\n\n===Postgraduate and mature colleges===\nSome colleges, such as [[Kellogg College, Oxford|Kellogg]], [[Linacre College, Oxford|Linacre]], [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield]], [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's]], [[St Cross College, Oxford|St Cross]] and [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson]] only admit postgraduate students.

Although the university says that the college listings are \"not very significant\", the 2005 table was the first Norrington Table with official data and also probably the first to be accurate. Dame [[Fiona Caldicott]], the Chairman of the Conference of Colleges, said that in previous years some students had used the ''[[Data Protection Act 1998]]'' to ensure their results were not published, rendering the unofficial tables inaccurate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4220284.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Oxford publishes college rankings|date=2005-09-06|accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] ranked first among the 30 Oxford undergraduate colleges in the Norrington table.<ref>http://cherwell.org/2018/08/21/st-johns-tops-2018-norrington-table/</ref>\n\n==College rivalries==\nA tradition of the university is a [[College rivalry|friendly rivalry between colleges]].
