The first settlers from the [[Paoay, Ilocos Norte|Paoay]] area in [[Ilocos Norte]] arrived in 1830, and founded the first Spanish settlement that developed into what is now San Antonio.\n\nSan Antonio was given the status of district or barrio in 1836. The town mayor in that period was Don Gregorio Banaga. He governed the town from 1836 to 1849. He was succeeded by Don Vicente Lacuesta in 1849, from Teniente Primero to Teniente Absoluto. The last mayor was Don Santiago Ladrillono. He was succeeded by Don Dimas Pascasio as governor in 1856. They selected their leaders every year. In 1891 to 1898, Don Pablo Corpus was the only Capitan Municipal selected then appointed Don Felix Magsaysay as the first President municipal, and many more followed up to 1931 to 1945.\n\nThe town was the site of the United States Navy Base known as the [[U.S. Naval Communications Station San Miguel]].

Its students won national competitions like the NAMCYA. \n* '''Casa San Miguel''': Founded by violinist Coke Bolipata, the community center provides its members the time and space for developing their interest and talent in classical music.\n*'''Pundaquit''': Nestled in the navel of the Zambales coastline, a Spanish Light House from the 1800s is found atop the \"Islas de Punta Capones.\" This is reminiscent of places such as \"Sierra Leone.\" Zambales is also home to the famous Crystal Beach surf in the town of San Narciso.

It is known for its secluded coves, beaches and pine-forested mountains.\n*'''Anawangin Cove''': It is a crescent shaped cove with a pristine white sand beach. What makes the place unique is the unusual riddle of tall pine-like trees flourishing round its vicinity.

It is only accessible by a 30-minute boat ride from Pundaquit, San Antonio, or by a six-hour trek through hot, open trails thru the Pundaquit range. The cove's relative isolation has kept it free from development.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Just behind the beach is the pine forest and a marsh, where there are natural springs feeding to the sea.{{fact|date=October 2018}} The area is home to a number of bird species.<ref>http://www.waypoints.ph/detail_gen.php?wpt=anwngn</ref>\n*'''Nagsasa Cove'''\n*'''Talisayin Cove'''\n*'''Silangen Cove'''\n*'''[[Capones Island]]'''\n*'''Camara Island'''\n\n==Education==\n[[File:US Navy 090417-N-6692A-049 Sailors aboard the Navy's forward-deployed amphibious dock landing ship USS Tortuga (LSD 46) and sailors of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Navy paint and repair the West Derita Elementary School.jpg|thumb|right|Military personnel paint and repair the West Dirita Elementary School in San Antonio during a community service project.]]\n*'''Elementary'''\n** Hildegarde Von Bingen Academy, Inc.

Mayor Zozimo Pascasio and the Holy Name Society adopted the program in the '60s and '70s. Their partnership produced players who became athletic scholars in various colleges and universities in Manila. In the early '80s, JJ Henry & Chuck Jones of FRA Branch 367 (US Navy retirees) living in San Antonio, further enhanced the enthusiasm for the sport through the Shipmates, a team of 10- to 12-year-old boys coming from the different barangays who competed in the PABA  (Philippine Amateur Baseball Association) Invitational. In 1985, the core of the team intact & playing for TR Yangco Educational Institute, the Shipmates coached by Butch Echiverre, won the baseball gold in the CLRAA (Central Luzon Regional Athletic Association), a first for Zambales. The San Antonio \"TNT\" Jaycees, most of whom are employees at the US Navy base, continued the program with their annual San Antonio Summer Baseball Cup successfully.\n\nAfter the eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1991, due to the destruction of the playing fields and the withdrawal of the US bases, support for the baseball program dwindled. Eager to find an alternative sports activity, Butch Echiverre and some friends introduced darts to the community. From its humble beginnings at a place called \"Kubo,\" presently, the Zambales Darters Federation is considered as one of the best dart organizations in the country for having hosted several national competitions. Its \"no-school, no-play\" policy is now adopted nationwide and the NDFP (National Darts Federation of the Philippines) conferred the President's Award to the group during the Darterong Pinoy 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ndfpdarts.com/index1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028012128/http://ndfpdarts.com/index1.htm |archivedate=2012-10-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe community's love for baseball was rekindled in the late '90s after losing the provincial baseball crown to Botolan, Zambales. The SADTEA (San Antonio District Teachers & Employees Association) took the initiative of organizing an inter-school tournament. This time, a softball tournament for girls is included. Supported by some officials of the local government and equipment donated by San Antonians locally & abroad, San Antonio baseball/softball is better than it ever was. As a member of the Little League Asia Pacific Region, San Antonio has always reached the quarterfinals of the Philippine Series. Irwin Mata is the Little League President of San Antonio.\n\nAside from fast becoming a surfing capital of Luzon,<ref>http://www.juice.ph/blogs/outoftown/the-first-tagadagat-surfing-competition-at-san-antonio-zambales</ref> San Antonio has an 18-hole golf course at the Naval Education and Training Command of the Philippine Navy (formerly US Naval Communication Station).\n\n==Notable people from San Antonio==\n[[File:SanAntonio,Zambalesjf8917 09.JPG|thumbnail|right|Monument to Teodoro Yangco in front of San Antonio municipal hall]]\n* Don [[Teodoro R.

The first settlers from the [[Paoay, Ilocos Norte|Paoay]] area in [[Ilocos Norte]] arrived in 1830, and founded the first Spanish settlement that developed into what is now San Antonio.\n\nSan Antonio was given the status of district or barrio in 1836. The town mayor in that period was Don Gregorio Banaga. He governed the town from 1836 to 1849. He was succeeded by Don Vicente Lacuesta in 1849, from Teniente Primero to Teniente Absoluto. The last mayor was Don Santiago Ladrillono. He was succeeded by Don Dimas Pascasio as governor in 1856. They selected their leaders every year.

Tiklados catered to the following instruments: piano, violin, guitar, organ, flute, and voice. Solfegge and Music Theory are also offered in the center.

It is known for its secluded coves, beaches and pine-forested mountains.\n*'''Anawangin Cove''': It is a crescent shaped cove with a pristine white sand beach. What makes the place unique is the unusual riddle of tall pine-like trees flourishing round its vicinity.

It is only accessible by a 30-minute boat ride from Pundaquit, San Antonio, or by a six-hour trek through hot, open trails thru the Pundaquit range. The cove's relative isolation has kept it free from development.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Just behind the beach is the pine forest and a marsh, where there are natural springs feeding to the sea.{{fact|date=October 2018}} The area is home to a number of bird species.<ref>http://www.waypoints.ph/detail_gen.php?wpt=anwngn</ref>\n*'''Nagsasa Cove'''\n*'''Talisayin Cove'''\n*'''Silangen Cove'''\n*'''[[Capones Island]]'''\n*'''Camara Island'''\n\n==Education==\n[[File:US Navy 090417-N-6692A-049 Sailors aboard the Navy's forward-deployed amphibious dock landing ship USS Tortuga (LSD 46) and sailors of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Navy paint and repair the West Derita Elementary School.jpg|thumb|right|Military personnel paint and repair the West Dirita Elementary School in San Antonio during a community service project.]]\n*'''Elementary'''\n** Hildegarde Von Bingen Academy, Inc.

Mayor Zozimo Pascasio and the Holy Name Society adopted the program in the '60s and '70s. Their partnership produced players who became athletic scholars in various colleges and universities in Manila. In the early '80s, JJ Henry & Chuck Jones of FRA Branch 367 (US Navy retirees) living in San Antonio, further enhanced the enthusiasm for the sport through the Shipmates, a team of 10- to 12-year-old boys coming from the different barangays who competed in the PABA  (Philippine Amateur Baseball Association) Invitational. In 1985, the core of the team intact & playing for TR Yangco Educational Institute, the Shipmates coached by Butch Echiverre, won the baseball gold in the CLRAA (Central Luzon Regional Athletic Association), a first for Zambales. The San Antonio \"TNT\" Jaycees, most of whom are employees at the US Navy base, continued the program with their annual San Antonio Summer Baseball Cup successfully.\n\nAfter the eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1991, due to the destruction of the playing fields and the withdrawal of the US bases, support for the baseball program dwindled. Eager to find an alternative sports activity, Butch Echiverre and some friends introduced darts to the community. From its humble beginnings at a place called \"Kubo,\" presently, the Zambales Darters Federation is considered as one of the best dart organizations in the country for having hosted several national competitions. Its \"no-school, no-play\" policy is now adopted nationwide and the NDFP (National Darts Federation of the Philippines) conferred the President's Award to the group during the Darterong Pinoy 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ndfpdarts.com/index1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028012128/http://ndfpdarts.com/index1.htm |archivedate=2012-10-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe community's love for baseball was rekindled in the late '90s after losing the provincial baseball crown to Botolan, Zambales. The SADTEA (San Antonio District Teachers & Employees Association) took the initiative of organizing an inter-school tournament. This time, a softball tournament for girls is included. Supported by some officials of the local government and equipment donated by San Antonians locally & abroad, San Antonio baseball/softball is better than it ever was. As a member of the Little League Asia Pacific Region, San Antonio has always reached the quarterfinals of the Philippine Series. Irwin Mata is the Little League President of San Antonio.\n\nAside from fast becoming a surfing capital of Luzon,<ref>http://www.juice.ph/blogs/outoftown/the-first-tagadagat-surfing-competition-at-san-antonio-zambales</ref> San Antonio has an 18-hole golf course at the Naval Education and Training Command of the Philippine Navy (formerly US Naval Communication Station).\n\n==Notable people from San Antonio==\n[[File:SanAntonio,Zambalesjf8917 09.JPG|thumbnail|right|Monument to Teodoro Yangco in front of San Antonio municipal hall]]\n* Don [[Teodoro R. Yangco]], noted philanthropist and business magnate, was born in San Antonio, Zambales on November 9, 1861. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts from the Ateneo de Manila University and studied law at the University of Santo Tom\u00e1s. He pursued a commercial course at Ealing College in London from 1882 to 1886. He served as Resident Commissioner of the Philippine Islands from 1917-1920 in Washington D.C. In 1923, he represented the Philippine Chamber of Commerce at the first Pan-Pacific Commercial Conference held in Honolulu, where he ably defended Philippine Independence. He generously supported the local YMCA such that he came to be called the \u201cFather of the YMCA in the Philippines.\u201d He died on April 20, 1939 and was buried at the North Cemetery.\n* [[Guillermo Pablo]], Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines from 1945 to 1955, was born on June 25, 1886 in San Antonio, Zambales.  Prior to his appointment to the High Court, he was Justice of the Peace (1911) at Iba, Zambales; Acting Provincial Fiscal (1915) of Zambales, Member of the Philippine Legislature (1916\u20131922); CFI Auxiliary Judge (1924) at Cebu; and CFI Judge (1930) and CFI District Judge (1934).\n\n==In film==\n* The Bea Alonzo and Sam Milby movie ''[[And I Love You So (film)|And I Love You So]]'', was shot at Anawangin Cove in San Antonio, a 30-minute boat ride from Pundaquit.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.pundaquit.com/ Pundaquit's Official Website]\n*[http://nap.psa.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131004104825/http://census.gov.ph/ Philippine Census Information]\n\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre    = San Antonio\n | North     = [[San Narciso, Zambales|San Narciso]]\n | Northeast = [[San Marcelino, Zambales|San Marcelino]]\n | East      = [[Castillejos, Zambales|Castillejos]]<br>[[Subic, Zambales|Subic]]\n | South     = ''[[South China Sea]]''\n | West      = ''[[South China Sea]]''\n}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Articles Related to San Antonio, Zambales\n| list  = \n{{Zambales}}\n{{Central Luzon}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Zambales]]\n[[Category:Beaches of the Philippines]]\n", "name_user": "Uzume", "label": "safe", "comment": "defaults to the current QID", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio,_Zambales"}

By the time of the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century, these ancient communities had been ruled by various empires and included the [[Babylonian Jews|Babylonian]], [[Persian Jews|Persian]], [[Jews in Carthage|Carthaginian]], [[Hellenistic Jews|Greek]], [[Roman Jews|Roman]], [[Byzantine Jews|Byzantine]], [[Old Yishuv|Ottoman]] and [[Yemenite Jews]].\n\n[[Islamic\u2013Jewish relations|Jews under Islamic rule]] were given the status of [[dhimmi]], along with certain other pre-Islamic religious groups.<ref>Bat Ye'or (1985), p. 45</ref> Though [[second-class citizen]]s, these non-Muslim groups were nevertheless accorded certain rights and protections as \"[[people of the book]]\". During [[Jews in the Middle Ages|waves of persecution in Medieval Europe]], many [[Jewish refugees|Jews found refuge]] in Muslim lands.<ref>Lewis 1984 p. 62</ref> For instance, [[Golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula|Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula]] were invited to settle in various parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they would often form a prosperous [[model minority]] of merchants [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|acting as intermediaries for their Muslim rulers]].\n\nToday, Jews residing in [[Muslim countries]] have been [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|reduced to a small fraction]] of their [[Historical Jewish population comparisons|former sizes]], with [[Jews in Iran|Iran]] and [[Jews in Turkey|Turkey]] being home to the largest remaining Jewish populations.\n\n==Middle Ages==\n\n===Muslim conquests===\n{{main|History of the Jews in the Arabian Peninsula}}\nThere were, for a long but uncertain period, a significant number of Jews in [[Arabia]]. Historians claim that very large numbers of Jews \u2013 as many as 80,000 \u2013 arrived after the destruction of the [[First Temple]], to join others already long-established in places such as the oasis of [[Khaybar]] as well as the trading colonies in [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]] (where they had their own [[cemetery]]). Another theory posits that these Jews were refugees from [[Byzantine]] persecutions. Arab historians mention some 20 Jewish communities, including two of [[Kohanim]].<ref>Bernard Lewis, ''The Crisis of Islam'' (London, 2003), p. XXVII</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitution of Medina]], written shortly after [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]], addressed some points regarding the civil and religious situation for the Jewish communities living within the city from an Islamic perspective. For example, the constitution stated that the Jews \"will profess their religion, and the Muslims theirs\", and they \"shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims for theirs\". After the [[Battle of Badr]], the Jewish tribe of [[Banu Qaynuqa]] breached treaties and agreements with Muhammad. Muhammad regarded this as [[casus belli]] and besieged the [[Banu Qaynuqa]].

They were considered to be impure, and therefore forbidden to touch a Muslim or a Muslim's food. They were obligated to humble themselves before a Muslim, to walk to the left side, and greet him first. They could not build houses higher than a Muslim's or ride a camel or horse, and when riding on a mule or a donkey, they had to sit sideways. Upon entering the Muslim quarter a Jew had to take off his foot-gear and walk barefoot. If attacked with stones or fists by Islamic youth, a Jew was not allowed to defend himself.

About one-third of the some 120,000-150,000 Iranian Jews in the mid-20th century fled the country during the 1950s, as a consequence of political instability. Most of the remaining 80,000-100,000 Jews fled during and following the Islamic Revolution of 1979.\n\nToday, the largest groups of Persian Jews are found in [[Israel]] (236,000-360,000 in 2014, including second-generation Israelis) and the [[United States]] (45,000, especially in the [[Los Angeles]] area, home to a large concentration of [[expatriate]] Iranians).

The Jews lived under the Ottoman Empire and under the Persian Empire for many years and following World War I, they lived mainly in Iraq, Iran and Turkey, some lived in Syria. Jews lived in many Kurdish urban centers such as Aqra, Dohuk, Arbil, Zakho, Sulaimaniya, Amadia, in Southern Kurdistan, in Saqiz, Bana and Ushno, in Eastern Kurdistan, in Jezira, Nisebin, Mardin and Diyarbak\u0131r in Turkey and in Qamishle in North-Western Syria. Jews lived as well in hundreds of villages in the rural and tribal area of Kurdistan, usually one or two families in a village, where they worked as weavers of traditional Kurdish clothing or as tenants of the ''agha'', the landlord or head of the village.\n\n===Persia===\n{{main|Persian Jews|History of the Jews in Iran}}\nIn 1656, all Jews were expelled from [[Isfahan]] and [[forced to convert to Islam]] because of a common belief that their Jewishness was impure. However, as it became known that the converts continued to practice [[Judaism]] in secret and because the treasury suffered from the loss of ''jizya'' collected from the Jews, in 1661 they were allowed to revert to Judaism, although they were still required to wear a distinctive patch on their clothing.<ref name=\"littman1\">Littman (1979), p. 3</ref>\n\nIn 1839, in the eastern Persian city of [[Meshed]], a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]].

J. Benjamin]] wrote of [[Persian Jews]]: <blockquote>''\"\u2026they are obliged to live in a separate part of town\u2026; for they are considered as unclean creatures\u2026  Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt\u2026  For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans\u2026  If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults.

They were considered to be impure, and therefore forbidden to touch a Muslim or a Muslim's food. They were obligated to humble themselves before a Muslim, to walk to the left side, and greet him first. They could not build houses higher than a Muslim's or ride a camel or horse, and when riding on a mule or a donkey, they had to sit sideways. Upon entering the Muslim quarter a Jew had to take off his foot-gear and walk barefoot. If attacked with stones or fists by Islamic youth, a Jew was not allowed to defend himself. In such situations he had the option of fleeing or seeking intervention by a merciful Muslim passerby.<ref>Jewish Communities in Exotic Places,\" by Ken Blady, [[Jason Aronson]] Inc., 2000, page 10</ref>\n\n==Post-colonial era==\n\n===Arab League===\n{{further| Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}\nBy the mid 1970s the vast majority of Jews [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|had left, fled or had been expelled]] from Arab and Muslim-majority  countries, moving primarily to Israel, France and the United States.<ref name=Shenhav>[[Yehouda Shenhav]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=k7FoMi-qY4kC&source=gbs_navlinks_s The Arab Jews: A Postcolonial Reading of Nationalism, Religion, and Ethnicity]</ref> The reasons for the exodus are varied and disputed.<ref name=Shenhav/> In 1945, there were between 758,000 and 866,000 Jews living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,000. In some Arab states, such as [[Libya]], which once had a Jewish population of around 3 percent, similar to that of the [[American Jews|United States]] today), the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.\n\nThe largest communities of Jews in Muslim countries exist in the non-Arab countries of [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]; both, however, are much smaller than they historically have been. Among Arab countries, the largest Jewish community now exists in [[Morocco]] with about 2,000 Jews and in Tunisia with about 1,000.\n\n===Imperial Iran and Islamic Republic===\nJudaism is the second-oldest religion still existing in Iran after [[Zoroastrianism]]. By various estimates, between 8,000 and 10,000 Jews remain in [[Iran]], mostly in [[Tehran]] and [[Hamedan]]. About one-third of the some 120,000-150,000 Iranian Jews in the mid-20th century fled the country during the 1950s, as a consequence of political instability. Most of the remaining 80,000-100,000 Jews fled during and following the Islamic Revolution of 1979.\n\nToday, the largest groups of Persian Jews are found in [[Israel]] (236,000-360,000 in 2014, including second-generation Israelis) and the [[United States]] (45,000, especially in the [[Los Angeles]] area, home to a large concentration of [[expatriate]] Iranians).

It is about an 11-year-old girl and her best friend Tico, a female [[orca]].\n\nUnlike the other series in Nippon Animation's ''[[World Masterpiece Theater]]'' line, ''Tico of the Seven Seas'' is an entirely original story. An English dub of the series, entitled ''Tico & Friends'', was produced by [[Ocean Productions|Ocean Studios]]. The dubbed series makes two significant alterations to the original Japanese series; the secondary protagonist Tico and the main antagonist Adrienne Bennex, survive while their original counterparts die. Some violent, bloody and death scenes are also edited out.\n\n==Plot==\nNanami Simpson is a young Japanese-American girl. Having lost her mother when was young, she now lives with her marine biologist father, Scott Simpson, on board his research vessel, the ''Peperonchino''. Scott has been in search of a creature known as the Luminous Whale, a whale that can glow brightly underwater, for many years and is determined to eventually see it and preserve it's exsistence. Nanami also is close friends with an orca named Tico, who was rescued as a baby just before Nanami was born. The two have an unbreakable bond and swim with each other every day. As a result, Nanami gradually learns to hold her breath longer and swim deeper than other humans can. \n\nScott's search from the Luminous Whale soon puts him at odds with the Gaiatron Corporation, a greedy research conglomerate led by the ruthless and ambitious Adrienne Benex, who wishes to exploit the creature for a rare element it seemingly carries in its body. Aiding Benex are her right-hand man, Gaulois, and Dr. Charles LeConte, an old acquaintance of Scott's who is obsessed with the Luminous Whale.\n\nTogether, Nanami, Scott, and Tico, along with Scott's first-mate and right-hand man, Al Andretti, seek to locate the Luminous Whale before Benex and Gaiatron can. As their journey goes on, they are joined by new crew members:\n* Cheryl Melville, an English-American heiress looking for adventure.\n* James McIntyre, Cheryl's loyal butler.\n* Thomas LeConte, Dr. LeConte's introverted and lonely, but intelligent son, who wishes to prove himself capable in the real world.\n* Junior, Tico's calf, born nearly halfway through the series.\n\nAs the journey goes on, the crew of ''Peperonchino'' encounter and make both new friends and enemies, and form bonds with each other, as they race against the corrupt Benex and Gaiatron to find the Luminous Whale first.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n; Nanami Simpson\n: Voiced by [[Megumi Hayashibara]]; [[Chantal Strand]] in the English dub\n: Nanami is the main protagonist in the series. At 11-years old, she claims all from the sea are her friends. She has been friends with Tico ever since she was a baby, and has a close relationship with her father Scott, and friendships with all of their crew members throughout the series.\n\n; Tico\n: A [[killer whale]] who is a life-long friend to Nanami. In the Japanese version, she dies freeing Al's submersible from an iceberg crevice, which mortally injures her, and her body sinks to the depths of the sea, while Nanami looks on helplessly. In the last episode, \"The Shining Circle\" her spirit reunites with Nanami and her son via the Luminous Whale. In the English dub, she is still injured, but survives and the crew is forced to leave her behind to let her recover. She returns a few episodes later, shortly after her son Junior leaves the crew to join a super-pod of killer whales. In the final episode, the spirit that Tico reunites with turns out to be her own long-lost mother.\n\n; Junior\n: Junior is Tico's calf. In the Japanese original series, he takes Tico's place as Nanami's companion, along with her name, after the former sacrifices herself to save Al. He meets his mother again the series finale, \"The Shining Circle\". In the English dub, his mother survives, and is left behind to recover, returning not long after he leaves to join a super-pod of killer whales.\n\n; Scott Simpson\n: Voiced by [[Shuuichi Ikeda]]; [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]] in the English dub\n: Nanami's father, who is a marine biologist, and captain of the ''Peperoncino''. He has been searching for the Luminous Whale for seven years. He is a dedicated father to his daughter and is often the level-headed one for his crew. Scott is also very protective of his research of the Luminous Whale, refusing to let it or the creature itself fall into the wrong hands.\n\n; Alfonso \"Al\" Andretti\n: A fat Italian man who works with Scott, and always on the lookout for treasure. He is the chef and engineer of ''Peperoncino'' and often comes up with get-rich quick schemes in order to make the crew money. He serves as something of an uncle and mentor to Nanami and later to Thomas as well. A scene where he punches Professor LeConte in the stomach is removed.\n\n; Cheryl Christina Melville\n: Voiced by [[Venus Terzo]] in the English dub.\n: An English-American woman who comes from a wealthy family and craves adventure. She initially has a frosty relationship with the crew, particularly Nanami and Al (due to her joining the crew on a whim, and her initial reluctance to due any actual work), but they all soon warm up to her, and she ends up becoming a valued member and even something of a big sister to Nanami and Thomas. Due to her wealth, she often serves as the source for emergency funds when the crew needs them. Initially, she relies on her butler James to do the crew work for her, but later starts contributing by herself following his brief departure from the crew in the seventh episode, and becomes more independent as a result.\n\n; James McIntyre\n: Voiced by David Kaye in the English dub\n: Cheryl's loyal butler. Born near the Cliffs of Dover, he has served the Melville family faithfully for many years, and is charged with looking after Cheryl while she attends college in New York. James joins the crew of the ''Peperoncino'' at the same time as Cheryl, but leaves in the seventh episode and joins the crew of the Gaiatron ship ''Scorpio'', after switching places with Thomas LeConte. He returns to the ''Peperoncino'' ten episodes later, and remains with the crew up to the series finale.\n\n; Thomas LeConte\n: A boy the ''Peperoncino'' crew met in the Bahamas and the son of scientist Dr. Charles LeConte. Intelligent and computer-savvy, but also introverted, lonely, and somewhat cautious, he craves attention from his father, but is often pushed aside and neglected due to Dr. LeConte's research regarding the Luminous Whale. In his first appearance in the second episode, he cons Nanami and Al in helping him return to his ship in return for a treasure map that turns out to be fake. Several episodes later, the crew meets him again on his father's ship, and after being rescued after getting trapped underwater in the ''Peperoncino'''s mini-sub, he decides to join their crew to go out into the world and become more extroverted, becoming Al's unofficial apprentice and Nanami's closest human friend. By the end of the series, he mananges to patch things up with his father.\n\n===Other characters===\n\n; Nagisa Suzuki\n: Nanami's aunt from her mother, Yuko's side of the family.\n\n; Gayle\n: A con-man with a heart of gold, and a crush on Cheryl. He also has a fear of fish.\n\n; Richard\n: A free-lance photographer who informs the ''Peperoncino'' crew about Metal Claw's activities.\n\n; Lolo\n: Richard's pet parrot.\n\n; Metal Claw\n: Voiced by [[Daisuke Gouri]]; [[Scott McNeil]] in the English dub\n: A villain from the earlier part in the series, he is a man who has a metal hand in place of his right hand. Captain of the ''Mentil''.\n\n; Professor Charles LeConte\n: A scientist who is an old acquaintance of Scott Simpson, and Thomas's father. Obsessed with the Luminous Whale, LeConte's determination to find it causes him to ally himself with the corrupt Gaiatron Corporation, and neglect his son. By the end of the series, however, he learns the error of his ways and reconciles with Thomas. A scene where he slaps his son is edited out in the English Dub.\n\n; Stephen\n: A member of the crew on the ''Scorpio''.\n\n; Topia\n: Voiced by [[Akiko Yajima]]\n\n; Enrico Andretti\n: Voiced by [[Bin Shimada]]\n: A cousin of Al's, who lives with their 94-year-old grandmother.\n\n; Don Gould (Mr. Krang in the English dub)\n: Head of the Rio Connection.\n\n; Rozalint\n: Voiced by [[Hisako Ky\u014dda]]\n\n; Adrienne Benex\n: Voiced by [[Chiyoko Kawashima]]\n: The main villain of the series. Professor LeConte's superior, she owns the Gaiatron Corporation. She wants the luminous whale due to an element it is said to have, called trontium.

It is about an 11-year-old girl and her best friend Tico, a female [[orca]].\n\nUnlike the other series in Nippon Animation's ''[[World Masterpiece Theater]]'' line, ''Tico of the Seven Seas'' is an entirely original story. An English dub of the series, entitled ''Tico & Friends'', was produced by [[Ocean Productions|Ocean Studios]]. The dubbed series makes two significant alterations to the original Japanese series; the secondary protagonist Tico and the main antagonist Adrienne Bennex, survive while their original counterparts die. Some violent, bloody and death scenes are also edited out.\n\n==Plot==\nNanami Simpson is a young Japanese-American girl. Having lost her mother when was young, she now to lives with her marine biologist father, Scott Simpson, on board his research vessel, the ''Peperonchino''. Scott has been in search of a creature known as the Luminous Whale, a whale that can glow brightly underwater, for many years and is determined to eventually see it and preserve it's exsistence. Nanami also is close friends with an orca named Tico, who was rescued as a baby just before Nanami was born. The two have an unbreakable bond and swim with each other every day. As a result, Nanami gradually learns to hold her breath longer and swim deeper than other humans can. \n\nScott's search from the Luminous Whale soon puts him at odds with the Gaiatron Corporation, a greedy research conglomerate led by the ruthless and ambitious Adrienne Benex, who wishes to exploit the creature for a rare element it seemingly carries in its body. Aiding Benex are her right-hand man, Gaulois, and Dr. Charles LeConte, an old acquaintance of Scott's who is obsessed with the Luminous Whale.\n\nTogether, Nanami, Scott, and Tico, along with Scott's first-mate and right-hand man, Al Andretti, look to locate the Luminous Whale before Benex and Gaiatron can. As their journey goes on, they are joined by new crew members:\n* Cheryl Melville, an English-American heiress looking for adventure.\n* James McIntyre, Cheryl's loyal butler.\n* Thomas LeConte, Dr. LeConte's introverted and lonely, but intelligent son, who wishes to prove himself capable in the real world.\n* Junior, Tico's calf, born nearly halfway through the series.\n\nAs the journey goes on, the crew of ''Peperonchino'' encounter and make both new friends and enemies as they race against the corrupt Benex and Gaiatron to find the Luminous Whale first.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n; Nanami Simpson\n: Voiced by [[Megumi Hayashibara]]; [[Chantal Strand]] in the English dub\n: Nanami is the main protagonist in the series. At 11-years old, she claims all from the sea are her friends. She has been friends with Tico ever since she was a baby, and has a close relationship with her father Scott, and friendships with all of their crew members throughout the series.\n\n; Tico\n: A [[killer whale]] who is a life-long friend to Nanami. In the Japanese version, she dies freeing Al's submersible from an iceberg crevice, which mortally injures her, and her body sinks to the depths of the sea, while Nanami looks on helplessly. In the last episode, \"The Shining Circle\" her spirit reunites with Nanami and her son via the Luminous Whale. In the English dub, she is still injured, but survives and the crew is forced to leave her behind to let her recover. She returns a few episodes later, shortly after her son Junior leaves the crew to join a super-pod of killer whales. In the final episode, the spirit that Tico reunites with turns out to be her own long-lost mother.\n\n; Junior\n: Junior is Tico's calf. In the Japanese original series, he takes Tico's place as Nanami's companion, along with her name, after the former sacrifices herself to save Al. He meets his mother again the series finale, \"The Shining Circle\". In the English dub, his mother survives, and is left behind to recover, returning not long after he leaves to join a super-pod of killer whales.\n\n; Scott Simpson\n: Voiced by [[Shuuichi Ikeda]]; [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]] in the English dub\n: Nanami's father, who is a marine biologist, and captain of the ''Peperoncino''. He has been searching for the Luminous Whale for seven years. He is a dedicated father to his daughter and is often the level-headed one for his crew. Scott is also very protective of his research of the Luminous Whale, refusing to let it or the creature itself fall into the wrong hands.\n\n; Alfonso \"Al\" Andretti\n: A fat Italian man who works with Scott, and always on the lookout for treasure. He is the chef and engineer of ''Peperoncino'' and often comes up with get-rich quick schemes in order to make the crew money. He serves as something of an uncle and mentor to Nanami and later to Thomas as well. A scene where he punches Professor LeConte in the stomach is removed.\n\n; Cheryl Christina Melville\n: Voiced by [[Venus Terzo]] in the English dub.\n: An English-American woman who comes from a wealthy family and craves adventure. She initially has a frosty relationship with the crew, particularly Nanami and Al (due to her joining the crew on a whim, and her initial reluctance to due any actual work), but they all soon warm up to her, and she ends up becoming a valued member and even something of a big sister to Nanami and Thomas. Due to her wealth, she often serves as the source for emergency funds when the crew needs them. Initially, she relies on her butler James to do the crew work for her, but later starts contributing by herself following his brief departure from the crew in the seventh episode, and becomes more independent as a result.\n\n; James McIntyre\n: Voiced by David Kaye in the English dub\n: Cheryl's loyal butler. Born near the Cliffs of Dover, he has served the Melville family faithfully for many years, and is charged with looking after Cheryl while she attends college in New York. James joins the crew of the ''Peperoncino'' at the same time as Cheryl, but leaves in the seventh episode and joins the crew of the Gaiatron ship ''Scorpio'', after switching places with Thomas LeConte. He returns to the ''Peperoncino'' ten episodes later, and remains with the crew up to the series finale.\n\n; Thomas LeConte\n: A boy the ''Peperoncino'' crew met in the Bahamas and the son of scientist Dr. Charles LeConte. Intelligent and computer-savvy, but also introverted, lonely, and somewhat cautious, he craves attention from his father, but is often pushed aside and neglected due to Dr. LeConte's research regarding the Luminous Whale. In his first appearance in the second episode, he cons Nanami and Al in helping him return to his ship in return for a treasure map that turns out to be fake. Several episodes later, the crew meets him again on his father's ship, and after being rescued after getting trapped underwater in the ''Peperoncino'''s mini-sub, he decides to join their crew to go out into the world and become more extroverted, becoming Al's unofficial apprentice and Nanami's closest human friend. By the end of the series, he mananges to patch things up with his father.\n\n===Other characters===\n\n; Nagisa Suzuki\n: Nanami's aunt from her mother, Yuko's side of the family.\n\n; Gayle\n: A con-man with a heart of gold, and a crush on Cheryl. He also has a fear of fish.\n\n; Richard\n: A free-lance photographer who informs the ''Peperoncino'' crew about Metal Claw's activities.\n\n; Lolo\n: Richard's pet parrot.\n\n; Metal Claw\n: Voiced by [[Daisuke Gouri]]; [[Scott McNeil]] in the English dub\n: A villain from the earlier part in the series, he is a man who has a metal hand in place of his right hand. Captain of the ''Mentil''.\n\n; Professor Charles LeConte\n: A scientist who is an old acquaintance of Scott Simpson, and Thomas's father. Obsessed with the Luminous Whale, LeConte's determination to find it causes him to ally himself with the corrupt Gaiatron Corporation, and neglect his son. By the end of the series, however, he learns the error of his ways and reconciles with Thomas. A scene where he slaps his son is edited out in the English Dub.\n\n; Stephen\n: A member of the crew on the ''Scorpio''.\n\n; Topia\n: Voiced by [[Akiko Yajima]]\n\n; Enrico Andretti\n: Voiced by [[Bin Shimada]]\n: A cousin of Al's, who lives with their 94-year-old grandmother.\n\n; Don Gould (Mr. Krang in the English dub)\n: Head of the Rio Connection.\n\n; Rozalint\n: Voiced by [[Hisako Ky\u014dda]]\n\n; Adrienne Benex\n: Voiced by [[Chiyoko Kawashima]]\n: The main villain of the series. Professor LeConte's superior, she owns the Gaiatron Corporation. She wants the luminous whale due to an element it is said to have, called trontium. In the Japanese series, she is killed when seagulls attack and incapacitate the pilots of her escape helicopter, causing it to crash into her Antarctic Base, The Iron City, with her in it. The seagulls were summoned, along with other animals, by the luminous whale to attack the base. This is edited out in the English dub.\n\n; Gaulois\n: Voiced by [[Keisuke Yamashita]]\n: Benex's underling.\n\n; Terry Taft\n: Voiced by [[Yumi T\u014dma]]\n: A wheelchair-bound boy Nanami meets.

Some of the obstacles faced by this emerging economy are the need for a better education system and the lack of a skilled workforce; particularly in the [[poverty]]-ridden countryside, which struggles with inadequate basic [[infrastructure]].

[[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI) inflows reached US$600 million (7 percent of GDP), slightly more than what the country received in official aid. Domestic investment, driven largely by the private sector, accounted for 23.4 percent of GDP. Export growth, especially to the US, began to slow in late 2007 accompanied by stiffer competition from Vietnam and emerging risks (a slowdown in the US economy and lifting of safeguards on China's exports).

Agriculture accounted for 90 percent of [[GDP]] in 1985 and employed approximately 80 percent of the work force. [[Rice]] is the principle commodity.\n\nMajor secondary crops include [[maize]], [[cassava]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]], [[soybean]]s, [[sesame seed]]s, dry beans, and [[rubber]]. The principal commercial crop is rubber. In the 1980s it was an important primary commodity, second only to rice, and one of the country's few sources of foreign exchange.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Further|Tourism in Cambodia}}\nIn the 1960s, Cambodia was a prominent tourist destination in the [[Southeast Asia]]n region. Due to protracted periods of civil war, insurgencies, and especially the genocidal regime of the Khmer Rouge (see [[Khmer Rouge Genocide]]), Cambodia's tourism industry was reduced to being virtually non-existent. Since the late 1990s, tourism is fast becoming Cambodia's second largest industry, just behind the garment manufacturing.<ref name=\"Chheang 284\">{{cite journal|last=Chheang|first=Vannarith|title=The Political Economy of Tourism in Cambodia|pages=284}}</ref> In 2006, Cambodia's tourism sector generated a revenue of US$1.594 billion, which made up approximately 16% of the country's GDP.<ref name=\"Chheang 284\"/>\n\n[[File:Angkor Wat.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Angkor Wat]] in Siem Reap, Cambodia.]]\nCultural heritage tourism is especially popular in the country, with many foreign tourists visiting the ancient Hindu temple of [[Angkor Wat]] located in the [[Siem Reap]] province. Other popular tourist attractions include the [[Royal Palace, Phnom Penh]], as well as ecotourism spots such as [[Tonl\u00e9 Sap]] Lake and the [[Mekong]] River.\n\nThe tourism industry in Cambodia has been perpetuated by the development of important transportation infrastructure; in particular Cambodia's two international airports in [[Phnom Penh]] and [[Siem Reap]] respectively. To the Cambodian economy, tourism has been a means for accumulation of foreign currency earnings and employment for the Cambodian workforce, with about 250,000 jobs generated in 2006.<ref name=\"Chheang 284\"/> Meanwhile, challenges to the industry include a leakage of revenue to foreign markets due to a dependence on foreign goods as well as the prevalence of the [[Child sex tourism]] industry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chheang|first=Vannarith|title=The Political Economy of Tourism in Cambodia|pages=293}}</ref>\n\n=== Gambling industry ===\n{{main|Gambling in Cambodia}}\nThe gambling industry of Cambodia supports its tourism industry, which is mostly concentrated around the Siem Reap province. The introduction of casino on border cities and towns created an industry that has thrived and contributed to the generation of employment and a steady stream of revenue for the government. However, the issue of corruption in relation to the government bureaucratic process involved in the gambling sector has been raised. It has likewise spur growth in different parts of the country at border crossing towns like Poipet, Bavet and Koh Kong. The growth of the gambling industry in Cambodia is due to its proximity to Thailand where gambling is forbidden.\n\n[[File:Russian Blvd, P.P..JPG|thumb|300px|Russian Boulevard in [[Phnom Penh]].]]\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe increase in tourist arrivals has led to growing demand for hotels and other forms of accommodation surrounding tourist hotspots. Siem Reap in particular has seen a construction boom in recent years. The capital Phnom Penh has also witnessed a growth in the construction and real estate sector. Recently, planned projects that have been on the pipeline for several years have been shelved temporarily due to a reduction in foreign investment.\nFrom 2009, the Cambodian government has allowed foreigners to own condominiums. This has helped in attracting real estate investors from [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and other countries.\n\nThe construction sector attracted investment of $2.1 billion in 2012 which is a 72 per cent rise compared with 2011. Construction licenses issued stood at 1,694 projects in 2012, which was 20% lower than 2011 but they were higher in value.\n\n=== Resources ===\n{{Further|Natural resources of Cambodia|Mineral industry in Cambodia}}\n\n[[Petroleum seep|Oil seeps]] were discovered in Cambodia as early as the 1950s by Russian and Chinese geologists. Development of the industry was delayed, however, by the [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] and [[Cambodian Civil War]]s and the political uncertainty that followed.

Nonetheless, Cambodia continues to attract investors because of its low wages, plentiful labor, proximity to Asian raw materials, and favorable tax treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joosung J.|title=An Outlook for Cambodia's Garment Industry in the Post-Safeguard Policy Era|journal=Asian Survey|date=May\u2013June 2011|volume=51|issue=3|pages=559\u2013580|jstor=10.1525/as.2011.51.3.559|doi=10.1525/as.2011.51.3.559}}</ref>\n\n==Recent economic history==\n{{main|Economic history of Cambodia}}\nFollowing its independence from France in 1953, the Cambodian state has undergone five periods of political, social, and economic transformation:\n# [[Kingdom of Cambodia (1953\u20131970)|Kingdom of Cambodia]] (1953-1970)\n# [[Khmer Republic]] (1970\u20131975)\n# [[Democratic Kampuchea]] (1975-1982, ousted in 1979); became [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]] in exile (1982-1993)\n# [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (1979-1989), later renamed The State of Cambodia (1989\u20131992) \n# Kingdom of [[Cambodia]] (1993\u2013present)\n\nIn 1989, the State of Cambodia implemented reform policies that transformed the Cambodian economic system from a [[command economy]] to an open market one.<ref name=\"Chheang 2008 282\">{{cite journal|last=Chheang|first=Vannarith|title=The Political Economy of Tourism in Cambodia|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research|date=September 2008|volume=13|issue=3|pages=282|doi=10.1080/10941660802280414}}</ref> In line with the economic reformation, private property rights were introduced and state-owned enterprises were privatized. Cambodia also focused on integrating itself into regional and international economic blocs, such as the [[Association of South East Asian Nations]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] respectively. These policies triggered a growth in the economy, with its national GDP growing at an average of 6.1% before a period of domestic unrest and regional economic instability in 1997 ([[1997 Asian financial crisis]]).<ref name=\"Chheang 2008 282\"/> However, conditions improved and since 1999, the Cambodian economy has continued to grow at an average pace of approximately 6-8% per annum.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Un|first=Kheang|title=A Thin Veneer of Change|journal=Asian Survey|date=January 2012|volume=52|issue=1|pages=202\u2013209|jstor=10.1525/as.2012.52.1.202|doi=10.1525/as.2012.52.1.202}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Cambodia's [[gross domestic product]] grew by an estimated 18.6%. Garment exports rose by almost 8%, while tourist arrivals increased by nearly 35%. With exports decreasing, the 2007 GDP growth was driven largely by consumption and investment. [[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI) inflows reached US$600 million (7 percent of GDP), slightly more than what the country received in official aid. Domestic investment, driven largely by the private sector, accounted for 23.4 percent of GDP. Export growth, especially to the US, began to slow in late 2007 accompanied by stiffer competition from Vietnam and emerging risks (a slowdown in the US economy and lifting of safeguards on China's exports). US companies were the fifth largest investors in Cambodia, with more than $1.2 billion in investments over the period 1997-2007.\n\nCambodia was severely damaged by the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], and its main economic sector, the garment industry, suffered a 23% drop in exports to the United States and Europe.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joosung J .|title=An Outlook for Cambodia's Garment Industry in the Post-Safeguard Policy Era|journal=Asian Survey|date=May\u2013June 2011|volume=51|issue=3|pages=570|jstor=10.1525/as.2011.51.3.559|doi=10.1525/as.2011.51.3.559}}</ref> As a result, 60,000 workers were laid off.

Agriculture accounted for 90 percent of [[GDP]] in 1985 and employed approximately 80 percent of the work force. [[Rice]] is the principle commodity.\n\nMajor secondary crops include [[maize]], [[cassava]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]], [[soybean]]s, [[sesame seed]]s, dry beans, and [[rubber]]. The principal commercial crop is rubber. In the 1980s it was an important primary commodity, second only to rice, and one of the country's few sources of foreign exchange.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Further|Tourism in Cambodia}}\nIn the 1960s, Cambodia was a prominent tourist destination in the [[Southeast Asia]]n region. Due to protracted periods of civil war, insurgencies, and especially the genocidal regime of the Khmer Rouge (see [[Khmer Rouge Genocide]]), Cambodia's tourism industry was reduced to being virtually non-existent. Since the late 1990s, tourism is fast becoming Cambodia's second largest industry, just behind the garment manufacturing.<ref name=\"Chheang 284\">{{cite journal|last=Chheang|first=Vannarith|title=The Political Economy of Tourism in Cambodia|pages=284}}</ref> In 2006, Cambodia's tourism sector generated a revenue of US$1.594 billion, which made up approximately 16% of the country's GDP.<ref name=\"Chheang 284\"/>\n\n[[File:Angkor Wat.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Angkor Wat]] in Siem Reap, Cambodia.]]\nCultural heritage tourism is especially popular in the country, with many foreign tourists visiting the ancient Hindu temple of [[Angkor Wat]] located in the [[Siem Reap]] province. Other popular tourist attractions include the [[Royal Palace, Phnom Penh]], as well as ecotourism spots such as [[Tonl\u00e9 Sap]] Lake and the [[Mekong]] River.\n\nThe tourism industry in Cambodia has been perpetuated by the development of important transportation infrastructure; in particular Cambodia's two international airports in [[Phnom Penh]] and [[Siem Reap]] respectively. To the Cambodian economy, tourism has been a means for accumulation of foreign currency earnings and employment for the Cambodian workforce, with about 250,000 jobs generated in 2006.<ref name=\"Chheang 284\"/> Meanwhile, challenges to the industry include a leakage of revenue to foreign markets due to a dependence on foreign goods as well as the prevalence of the [[Child sex tourism]] industry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chheang|first=Vannarith|title=The Political Economy of Tourism in Cambodia|pages=293}}</ref>\n\n=== Gambling industry ===\n{{main|Gambling in Cambodia}}\nThe gambling industry of Cambodia supports its tourism industry, which is mostly concentrated around the Siem Reap province. The introduction of casino on border cities and towns created an industry that has thrived and contributed to the generation of employment and a steady stream of revenue for the government. However, the issue of corruption in relation to the government bureaucratic process involved in the gambling sector has been raised. It has likewise spur growth in different parts of the country at border crossing towns like Poipet, Bavet and Koh Kong. The growth of the gambling industry in Cambodia is due to its proximity to Thailand where gambling is forbidden.\n\n[[File:Russian Blvd, P.P..JPG|thumb|300px|Russian Boulevard in [[Phnom Penh]].]]\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe increase in tourist arrivals has led to growing demand for hotels and other forms of accommodation surrounding tourist hotspots. Siem Reap in particular has seen a construction boom in recent years. The capital Phnom Penh has also witnessed a growth in the construction and real estate sector. Recently, planned projects that have been on the pipeline for several years have been shelved temporarily due to a reduction in foreign investment.\nFrom 2009, the Cambodian government has allowed foreigners to own condominiums. This has helped in attracting real estate investors from [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and other countries.\n\nThe construction sector attracted investment of $2.1 billion in 2012 which is a 72 per cent rise compared with 2011. Construction licenses issued stood at 1,694 projects in 2012, which was 20% lower than 2011 but they were higher in value.\n\n=== Resources ===\n{{Further|Natural resources of Cambodia|Mineral industry in Cambodia}}\n\n[[Petroleum seep|Oil seeps]] were discovered in Cambodia as early as the 1950s by Russian and Chinese geologists. Development of the industry was delayed, however, by the [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] and [[Cambodian Civil War]]s and the political uncertainty that followed.

Wexford lies on the south side of [[Wexford Harbour]], the estuary of the [[River Slaney]] near the southeastern corner of the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]]. The town is linked to [[Dublin]] by the [[N11 road (Ireland)|M11/N11]] [[Roads in Ireland#National Primary Routes|National Primary Route]]; and to [[Rosslare Europort]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Waterford]] by the [[N25 road (Ireland)|N25]]. The [[rail transport in Ireland|national rail network]] connects it to Dublin and Rosslare Europort. It had a population of 20,188 according to the 2016 census.<ref name=\"sapmap2016\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Selskar Abbey, Wexford, Ireland.jpg|left|thumb|Ruins of [[Selskar Abbey]], Wexford.]]\n[[File:185 of 'Cromwell in Ireland, a history of Cromwell's Irish Campaign ... with map, plans and illustrations' (11162225324).jpg|thumb|Map of 17th-century Wexford.

They named it ''Veisafj\u01ebr\u00f0r'', meaning \"inlet of the mud flats\", and the name has changed only slightly into its present form. \"Vei\" in modern Norwegian means \"Way\". So 'Veisafj\u01ebr\u00f0r' could have meant \"inlet of the way\" or \"Way Fjord\". According to a story recorded in the ''[[Dindsenchas]]'', the name \"Loch Garman\" comes from a man named ''[[Garman mac Bomma Licce]]'' who was chased to the river mouth and drowned as a consequence of stealing the queen's crown from [[Temair]] during the feast of [[Samhain]].\n\nFor about three hundred years it was a Viking town, a city state, largely independent and owing only token dues to the Irish [[kings of Leinster]]. However, in May 1169 [[Dermot MacMurrough]], King of Leinster and his [[Normans|Norman]] ally, [[Robert Fitz-Stephen]] [[Siege of Wexford (1169)|besieged Wexford]]. The [[Norsemen|Norse]] inhabitants resisted fiercely until the [[Bishop of Ferns]] persuaded them to accept a settlement with Dermot.\n\nWexford was an [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] settlement in the [[Middle Ages]]. An old dialect of English, known as [[Yola language|Yola]], was spoken uniquely in Wexford up until the 19th century. The Yola name for Wexford was ''Weiseforthe''.<ref name=\"the journal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/column-yola-and-fingalian-%E2%80%93-the-forgotten-ancient-english-dialects-of-ireland-985649-Jul2013/|title=Column: Yola and Fingalian \u2013 the forgotten ancient English dialects of Ireland|first=Damian|last=Shiels|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nFollowing the [[Crusades]], the [[Knights Templar]] had a presence in Wexford. Up to the present, their name is perpetuated in the old Knights' Templars' chapel yard of St. John's Cemetery, on Wexford's Upper St. John's Street.\n\n[[County Wexford]] produced strong support for [[Confederate Ireland]] during the 1640s. A fleet of Confederate [[privateer]]s was based in Wexford town, consisting of sailors from [[Flanders]] and [[Spain]] as well as local men. Their vessels raided [[England|English]] Parliamentarian shipping, giving some of the proceeds to the Confederate government in [[Kilkenny]]. As a result, [[Sack of Wexford|the town was sacked]] by the [[Roundhead|English Parliamentarians]] during the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] in 1649. Many of its inhabitants were killed and much of the town was burned. In 1659 [[Solomon Richards]] was appointed Governor, but he was dismissed and imprisoned following the [[Restoration (Ireland)|Restoration]] the next year.\n\nCounty Wexford was the centre of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]] against British rule. Wexford town was held by the rebels throughout the [[Wexford Rebellion]] and was the scene of a notorious massacre of local [[Loyalist#18th century Ireland|loyalists]] by the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]], who executed them with pikes on [[Wexford bridge]].\n\n[[File:Wexford Opera House rises above the old skyline.jpg|thumb|Wexford Opera House, now the [[National Opera House (Ireland)|National Opera House]], amongst other buildings]]\n[[File:JFK-John Barry Memorial.jpg|thumb|President [[John F.

Willie Redmond sat as an MP for Wexford from 1883 until 1885. The younger [[John Redmond]], was a devoted follower of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and leader of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] until his death in April 1918. He is interred in the Redmond family vault, at the old Knights' Templars' chapel yard of St. John's Cemetery, Upper St. John's Street.\n\n''Redmond Park'' was formally opened in May 1931 as a memorial to [[William Hoey Kearney Redmond|Willie Redmond]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wexfordhub.com/places/redmond-park/|title=A Guide To Redmond Park|publisher=}}</ref> who died in 1917 while serving with the [[16th (Irish) Division]] during the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines offensive]] and was buried on the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]].\n\n==Culture==\nWexford hosts the [[Wexford Opera|Wexford Opera Festival]] every October. [[T. J. Walsh|Dr Tom Walsh]] started the festival in 1951, and it has since grown into the internationally recognised festival it is today. A fireworks display is held every year in conjunction with the festival.\n\nWexford has a number of music and drama venues including:\n* [[The National Opera House]] (formerly the Wexford Opera House), developed on the site of the historic [[Theatre Royal, Wexford|Theatre Royal]] [[opera house]];\n* the Dun Mhuire Theatre, which holds community theatre events including music events and hosting shows by Oyster Lane Theatre Group and Wexford Pantomime Society;\n* the Wexford Arts Centre, which hosts exhibitions, theatre, music and dance events;\n* [[Saint Ibar|St. Iberius's]] Church ([[Church of Ireland]]), various concerts are held here.\n* Red Books, an independent bookshop in St Peter's Square which hosts regular LiveLit, music and spoken word events, as well as book launches, and writers groups.\nWexford is the home of several youth and [[senior theatre]] groups, including the [[Bui Bolg Street Theatre Company|''Bu\u00ed Bolg'' Street Theatre Company]], Oyster Lane Theatre Group, Wexford Pantomime Society, Wexford Light Opera Society and Wexford Drama Group.\n\nThe [[National Lottery (Ireland)|National Lottery]] [[Skyfest]] was held in Wexford in March 2011 included a pyrotechnic waterfall on the towns main bridge spanning 300m.<ref name=\"SF2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-28230198.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924191952/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-28230198.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 September 2015 |title=Pyrotechnic spectacle banishes the gloom |url-access=subscription |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |last=Kane |first=Conor |publisher=[[Irish Times]] |accessdate=13 April 2015 |date=21 March 2011}}</ref> Bu\u00ed Bolg also performed on the night.<ref name=\"SF2011\" />\n\nUntil the mid-nineteenth century, the [[Yola language]] could be heard in Wexford, and a few words still remain in use.\n\nThe food of Wexford is also distinct from the rest of Ireland,{{fact|date=March 2020}} due to the local cultivation of seafood, smoked cod, mussels and rissoles being token dishes in the region.\n\n==Architecture==\nNotable churches within the town include the \"twin churches\", Bride Street and Rowe Street with their distinctive spires; [[Saint Ibar|St. Iberius]] [[Church of Ireland]], which dates from the 18th Century; [[St Peter's College, Wexford|Saint Peter's College]], with a chapel designed by [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Welby Pugin]]; and Ann Street [[Presbyterian]] church. A former [[Friends meeting house|Quaker meeting hall]] is now a band room in High Street. The twin churches can be seen from any part of Wexford and in 2008, their 150th anniversary were celebrated. The larger twin, on Rowe Street, contains a peal of ten change-ringing bells, cast by [[Gillett & Johnston]] in 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=wexford&Submit=+Go+&DoveID=WEXFORD|title=Dove Details|website=dove.cccbr.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, Wexford has seen the redevelopment of its quay front and a residential development at Clonard village.{{fact|date=March 2020}} Also, the relocated offices of the [[Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government|Department of Environment]] were constructed near Wexford General Hospital on Newtown Road, and opened in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/3ab734-department-of-the-environment-community-and-local-government-wexford/ | publisher = Office of Public Works | website = gov.ie | title = Press Release - Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Wexford | date = | accessdate = 26 March 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nWexford's success as a [[seaport]] declined in the first half of the 20th century because of the constantly changing sands of Wexford Harbour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wexfordhub.com/pictures/wexford-quay/|title=Wexford Quay|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref> By 1968 it had become unprofitable to keep dredging a channel from the harbour mouth to the quays in order to accommodate the larger ships of the era, so the port closed. The port had been extremely important to the local economy, with coal being a major import and agricultural machinery and grain being exported. The woodworks which fronted the quays and which were synonymous with Wexford were removed in the 1990s as part of a plan to claim the quay as an amenity for the town as well as retaining it as a commercially viable waterfront.\n\nIn the early 20th century, a new port was built about {{convert|20|km|mi}} to the south at Rosslare Harbour, now known as [[Rosslare Europort]]. This is a deepwater harbour, unaffected by tides and currents. All major shipping now uses this port and Wexford Port is used only by fishing boats and leisure vessels.\n\n[[File:Johnstown Castle - from the south-west.jpg|thumb|Johnstown Castle]]\n[[Johnstown Castle]], approximately 6&nbsp;km from Wexford town, is headquarters to [[Teagasc]], the [[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)|Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine]].\n\nMajor private sector employers in and around the town include Wexford Creamery, Celtic Linen, Wexford Viking Glass, Parker Hannifin IPDE, Waters Technology, Kent Stainless, [[Equifax]] and [[The Bank of New York Mellon|BNY Mellon]].

There are also many local taxi and hackney providers. Wexford Bus serves Wexford Town and rural County Wexford.\n\nRosslare Europort is 19 kilometres south of Wexford. Car ferries run between [[Fishguard]] and [[Pembroke Dock|Pembroke]] in Wales and [[Cherbourg]] and [[Roscoff]] in France.

Wexford was the first Wexford-based club to take part in the competition. The club was the brainchild of former property developer [[Mick Wallace]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], who funded the construction of a complex for the new team's home at Newcastle, Ferrycarrig. In 2015, the team won [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Irish Premier League, unfortunately being relegated the following year The club launched [[Wexford Youths W.F.C.|Wexford Youths WFC]], a [[Women's National League (Ireland)|Women's National League]] team, in 2011.\n\n===Gaelic football===\nWexford is also home to several [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] clubs. Though the town was traditionally associated with [[Gaelic football]], with six teams providing ample outlets for its youngsters, it was not until 1960 that hurling took its foothold, with much due to local man Oliver \"Hopper\" McGrath's contribution to the county's [[All-Ireland Hurling Final]] triumph over the then-champions [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]]. Having scored an early second-half goal to effectively kill off the opposition, McGrath went on to be the first man from the town of Wexford to receive an All-Ireland Hurling winner's\n\nAlthough the team has not achieved county senior football success since 1956, Volunteers (\"the Vols\") of Wexford Town hold a record eleven county senior titles, as well as six minor titles.

the [[county town]] of [[County Wexford]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Wexford lies on the south side of [[Wexford Harbour]], the estuary of the [[River Slaney]] near the southeastern corner of the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]]. The town is linked to [[Dublin]] by the [[N11 road (Ireland)|M11/N11]] [[Roads in Ireland#National Primary Routes|National Primary Route]]; and to [[Rosslare Europort]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Waterford]] by the [[N25 road (Ireland)|N25]]. The [[rail transport in Ireland|national rail network]] connects it to Dublin and Rosslare Europort. It had a population of 20,188 according to the 2016 census.<ref name=\"sapmap2016\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Selskar Abbey, Wexford, Ireland.jpg|left|thumb|Ruins of [[Selskar Abbey]], Wexford.]]\n[[File:185 of 'Cromwell in Ireland, a history of Cromwell's Irish Campaign ... with map, plans and illustrations' (11162225324).jpg|thumb|Map of 17th-century Wexford. Cromwell's men camped to the southwest.]]\n[[File:Wexford Pikeman Statue by Oliver Sheppard 2010 09 29.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wexford Pikeman Statue by [[Oliver Sheppard]] in memory of the 1798 rebellion]]\nThe town was founded by the [[Vikings]] in about 800 AD. They named it ''Veisafj\u01ebr\u00f0r'', meaning \"inlet of the mud flats\", and the name has changed only slightly into its present form. \"Vei\" in modern Norwegian means \"Way\". So 'Veisafj\u01ebr\u00f0r' could have meant \"inlet of the way\" or \"Way Fjord\". According to a story recorded in the ''[[Dindsenchas]]'', the name \"Loch Garman\" comes from a man named ''[[Garman mac Bomma Licce]]'' who was chased to the river mouth and drowned as a consequence of stealing the queen's crown from [[Temair]] during the feast of [[Samhain]].\n\nFor about three hundred years it was a Viking town, a city state, largely independent and owing only token dues to the Irish [[kings of Leinster]]. However, in May 1169 [[Dermot MacMurrough]], King of Leinster and his [[Normans|Norman]] ally, [[Robert Fitz-Stephen]] [[Siege of Wexford (1169)|besieged Wexford]]. The [[Norsemen|Norse]] inhabitants resisted fiercely until the [[Bishop of Ferns]] persuaded them to accept a settlement with Dermot.\n\nWexford was an [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] settlement in the [[Middle Ages]]. An old dialect of English, known as [[Yola language|Yola]], was spoken uniquely in Wexford up until the 19th century. The Yola name for Wexford was ''Weiseforthe''.<ref name=\"the journal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/column-yola-and-fingalian-%E2%80%93-the-forgotten-ancient-english-dialects-of-ireland-985649-Jul2013/|title=Column: Yola and Fingalian \u2013 the forgotten ancient English dialects of Ireland|first=Damian|last=Shiels|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nFollowing the [[Crusades]], the [[Knights Templar]] had a presence in Wexford. Up to the present, their name is perpetuated in the old Knights' Templars' chapel yard of St. John's Cemetery, on Wexford's Upper St. John's Street.\n\n[[County Wexford]] produced strong support for [[Confederate Ireland]] during the 1640s. A fleet of Confederate [[privateer]]s was based in Wexford town, consisting of sailors from [[Flanders]] and [[Spain]] as well as local men. Their vessels raided [[England|English]] Parliamentarian shipping, giving some of the proceeds to the Confederate government in [[Kilkenny]]. As a result, [[Sack of Wexford|the town was sacked]] by the [[Roundhead|English Parliamentarians]] during the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] in 1649. Many of its inhabitants were killed and much of the town was burned. In 1659 [[Solomon Richards]] was appointed Governor, but he was dismissed and imprisoned following the [[Restoration (Ireland)|Restoration]] the next year.\n\nCounty Wexford was the centre of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]] against British rule. Wexford town was held by the rebels throughout the [[Wexford Rebellion]] and was the scene of a notorious massacre of local [[Loyalist#18th century Ireland|loyalists]] by the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]], who executed them with pikes on [[Wexford bridge]].\n\n[[File:Wexford Opera House rises above the old skyline.jpg|thumb|Wexford Opera House, now the [[National Opera House (Ireland)|National Opera House]], amongst other buildings]]\n[[File:JFK-John Barry Memorial.jpg|thumb|President [[John F.

Willie Redmond sat as an MP for Wexford from 1883 until 1885. The younger [[John Redmond]], was a devoted follower of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and leader of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] until his death in April 1918. He is interred in the Redmond family vault, at the old Knights' Templars' chapel yard of St. John's Cemetery, Upper St. John's Street.\n\n''Redmond Park'' was formally opened in May 1931 as a memorial to [[William Hoey Kearney Redmond|Willie Redmond]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wexfordhub.com/places/redmond-park/|title=A Guide To Redmond Park|publisher=}}</ref> who died in 1917 while serving with the [[16th (Irish) Division]] during the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines offensive]] and was buried on the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]].\n\n==Culture==\nWexford hosts the [[Wexford Opera|Wexford Opera Festival]] every October. [[T. J. Walsh|Dr Tom Walsh]] started the festival in 1951, and it has since grown into the internationally recognised festival it is today. A fireworks display is held every year in conjunction with the festival.\n\nWexford has a number of music and drama venues including:\n* [[The National Opera House]] (formerly the Wexford Opera House), developed on the site of the historic [[Theatre Royal, Wexford|Theatre Royal]] [[opera house]];\n* the Dun Mhuire Theatre, which holds community theatre events including music events and hosting shows by Oyster Lane Theatre Group and Wexford Pantomime Society;\n* the Wexford Arts Centre, which hosts exhibitions, theatre, music and dance events;\n* [[Saint Ibar|St. Iberius's]] Church ([[Church of Ireland]]), various concerts are held here.\n* Red Books, an independent bookshop in St Peter's Square which hosts regular LiveLit, music and spoken word events, as well as book launches, and writers groups.\nWexford is the home of several youth and [[senior theatre]] groups, including the [[Bui Bolg Street Theatre Company|''Bu\u00ed Bolg'' Street Theatre Company]], Oyster Lane Theatre Group, Wexford Pantomime Society, Wexford Light Opera Society and Wexford Drama Group.\n\nThe [[National Lottery (Ireland)|National Lottery]] [[Skyfest]] was held in Wexford in March 2011 included a pyrotechnic waterfall on the towns main bridge spanning 300m.<ref name=\"SF2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-28230198.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924191952/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-28230198.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 September 2015 |title=Pyrotechnic spectacle banishes the gloom |url-access=subscription |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |last=Kane |first=Conor |publisher=[[Irish Times]] |accessdate=13 April 2015 |date=21 March 2011}}</ref> Bu\u00ed Bolg also performed on the night.<ref name=\"SF2011\" />\n\nUntil the mid-nineteenth century, the [[Yola language]] could be heard in Wexford, and a few words still remain in use.\n\nThe food of Wexford is also distinct from the rest of Ireland,{{fact|date=March 2020}} due to the local cultivation of seafood, smoked cod, mussels and rissoles being token dishes in the region.\n\n==Architecture==\nNotable churches within the town include the \"twin churches\", Bride Street and Rowe Street with their distinctive spires; [[Saint Ibar|St. Iberius]] [[Church of Ireland]], which dates from the 18th Century; [[St Peter's College, Wexford|Saint Peter's College]], with a chapel designed by [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Welby Pugin]]; and Ann Street [[Presbyterian]] church. A former [[Friends meeting house|Quaker meeting hall]] is now a band room in High Street. The twin churches can be seen from any part of Wexford and in 2008, their 150th anniversary were celebrated. The larger twin, on Rowe Street, contains a peal of ten change-ringing bells, cast by [[Gillett & Johnston]] in 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=wexford&Submit=+Go+&DoveID=WEXFORD|title=Dove Details|website=dove.cccbr.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, Wexford has seen the redevelopment of its quay front and a residential development at Clonard village.{{fact|date=March 2020}} Also, the relocated offices of the [[Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government|Department of Environment]] were constructed near Wexford General Hospital on Newtown Road, and opened in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/3ab734-department-of-the-environment-community-and-local-government-wexford/ | publisher = Office of Public Works | website = gov.ie | title = Press Release - Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Wexford | date = | accessdate = 26 March 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nWexford's success as a [[seaport]] declined in the first half of the 20th century because of the constantly changing sands of Wexford Harbour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wexfordhub.com/pictures/wexford-quay/|title=Wexford Quay|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref> By 1968 it had become unprofitable to keep dredging a channel from the harbour mouth to the quays in order to accommodate the larger ships of the era, so the port closed. The port had been extremely important to the local economy, with coal being a major import and agricultural machinery and grain being exported. The woodworks which fronted the quays and which were synonymous with Wexford were removed in the 1990s as part of a plan to claim the quay as an amenity for the town as well as retaining it as a commercially viable waterfront.\n\nIn the early 20th century, a new port was built about {{convert|20|km|mi}} to the south at Rosslare Harbour, now known as [[Rosslare Europort]]. This is a deepwater harbour, unaffected by tides and currents. All major shipping now uses this port and Wexford Port is used only by fishing boats and leisure vessels.\n\n[[File:Johnstown Castle - from the south-west.jpg|thumb|Johnstown Castle]]\n[[Johnstown Castle]], approximately 6&nbsp;km from Wexford town, is headquarters to [[Teagasc]], the [[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)|Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine]].\n\nMajor private sector employers in and around the town include Wexford Creamery, Celtic Linen, Wexford Viking Glass, Parker Hannifin IPDE, Waters Technology, Kent Stainless, [[Equifax]] and [[The Bank of New York Mellon|BNY Mellon]].

The [[Dublin-Rosslare railway line|railway line]] from [[Dublin]] to [[Rosslare Harbour]] runs along the quayside on the north-eastern edge of the town.

There are also many local taxi and hackney providers. Wexford Bus serves Wexford Town and rural County Wexford.\n\nRosslare Europort is 19 kilometres south of Wexford. Car ferries run between [[Fishguard]] and [[Pembroke Dock|Pembroke]] in Wales and [[Cherbourg]] and [[Roscoff]] in France. The ferry companies operating on these routes are [[Stena Line]] and [[Irish Ferries]].

Wexford was the first Wexford-based club to take part in the competition. The club was the brainchild of former property developer [[Mick Wallace]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], who funded the construction of a complex for the new team's home at Newcastle, Ferrycarrig. In 2015, the team won [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Irish Premier League, unfortunately being relegated the following year The club launched [[Wexford Youths W.F.C.|Wexford Youths WFC]], a [[Women's National League (Ireland)|Women's National League]] team, in 2011.\n\n===Gaelic football===\nWexford is also home to several [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] clubs. Though the town was traditionally associated with [[Gaelic football]], with six teams providing ample outlets for its youngsters, it was not until 1960 that hurling took its foothold, with much due to local man Oliver \"Hopper\" McGrath's contribution to the county's [[All-Ireland Hurling Final]] triumph over the then-champions [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]]. Having scored an early second-half goal to effectively kill off the opposition, McGrath went on to be the first man from the town of Wexford to receive an All-Ireland Hurling winner's\n\nAlthough the team has not achieved county senior football success since 1956, Volunteers (\"the Vols\") of Wexford Town hold a record eleven county senior titles, as well as six minor titles.

They were among the first and best-known collectors of German and European folk tales, and popularized traditional oral tale types such as \"[[Cinderella]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Aschenputtel}}\"), \"[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Der Froschk\u00f6nig}}\"), \"[[The Goose-Girl]]\" (\"Die G\u00e4nsemagd\"), \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" (\"{{lang|de|H\u00e4nsel und Gretel}}\"), \"[[Rapunzel]]\", \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\", \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", \"[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats]]\", \"[[The Three Little Pigs]]\", \"[[Rumpelstiltskin]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Rumpelstilzchen}}\"), \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Dornr\u00f6schen}}\"), and \"[[Snow White]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Schneewittchen}}\"). Their classic collection, ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Children's and Household Tales]]'' (''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}''), was published in two volumes\u2014the first in 1812 and the second in 1815.\n\nThe brothers were born in the town of [[Hanau]] in [[Hesse-Cassel]] (now Germany) and spent most of their childhood in the nearby town of [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe|Steinau]]. Their father's death in 1796 impoverished  the family and affected the brothers for many years after. They attended the [[University of Marburg]] where they began a lifelong dedication to researching the early history of German language and literature, including German [[Oral tradition|folktales]]. The rise of [[Romanticism]] during the 18th century had revived interest in traditional folk stories, which to the Grimms and their colleagues represented a pure form of national literature and culture. The Brothers Grimm established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for [[folkloristics|folklore studies]]. Between the first edition of 1812\u20131815 and the seventh (and final) edition of 1857, they revised their collection many times, so that it grew from 156 stories to more than 200.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The original folk & fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm : the complete first edition|others=Grimm, Wilhelm, 1786-1859,, Grimm, Jacob, 1785-1863,, Zipes, Jack, 1937-, Dezs\u00f6, Andrea|isbn=9780691160597|location=Princeton [New Jersey]|oclc=879662315|year = 2014}}</ref> In addition to collecting and editing folk tales, the brothers compiled German legends. Individually, they published a large body of linguistic and literary scholarship. Together, in 1838, they began work on a massive historical German dictionary (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}}'') which, in their lifetimes, they completed only as far as the word ''Frucht'' ('fruit').\n\nMany of the Grimms' folk tales have enjoyed enduring popularity. The tales are available in more than 100 languages and have been adapted by filmmakers including [[Lotte Reiniger]] and [[Walt Disney]], with films such as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''. During the 1930s and 40s, the tales were used as propaganda by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]; later in the 20th century, psychologists such as [[Bruno Bettelheim]] reaffirmed the value of the work, in spite of the cruelty and violence in original versions of some of the tales (which the Grimms eventually sanitized).\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:SteinauBGHFrosch retouched.jpg|thumb|left|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm lived in this house in [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe|Steinau]] from 1791 to 1796.]]\n[[Jacob Grimm|Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm]] was born on 4&nbsp;January 1785, and his brother [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm Carl Grimm]] was born on 24&nbsp;February 1786. Both were born in [[Hanau]], in the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (present-day Germany), to [[Philipp Grimm|Philipp Wilhelm Grimm]], a [[jurist]], and Dorothea Grimm n\u00e9e Zimmer, daughter of a [[Kassel]] city councilman.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> They were the second- and third-eldest surviving siblings in a family of nine children, three of whom died in infancy.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /><ref>Frederick Herman George ({{lang|de|Friedrich Hermann Georg}}; 12 December 1783&nbsp;\u2013 16 March 1784), [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]], [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]], Carl Frederick ({{lang|de|Carl Friedrich}}; 24 April 1787&nbsp;\u2013 25 May 1852), Ferdinand Philip ({{lang|de|Ferdinand Philipp}}; 18 December 1788&nbsp;\u2013 6 January 1845), Louis Emil ({{lang|de|Ludwig Emil}}; 14 March 1790&nbsp;\u2013 4 April 1863), Frederick ({{lang|de|Friedrich}}; 15 June 1791&nbsp;\u2013 20 August 1792), Charlotte \"Lotte\" Amalie (10 May 1793&nbsp;\u2013 15 June 1833) and George Edward ({{lang|de|Georg Eduard}}; 26 July 1794&nbsp;\u2013 19 April 1795).</ref><ref name=\"Michaelis-Jena-9\">{{Harvnb|Michaelis-Jena|1970|p=9}}</ref> In 1791, the family moved to the countryside town of [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe|Steinau]], when Philipp was employed there as district [[magistrate]] (''{{lang|de|[[Amtmann]]}}'').  The family became prominent members of the community, residing in a large home surrounded by fields. Biographer [[Jack Zipes]] writes that the brothers were happy in Steinau and \"clearly fond of country life\".<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> The children were educated at home by private tutors, receiving strict instruction as [[Lutherans]] that instilled in both a lifelong religious faith.<ref>Herbert Scurla: Die Br\u00fcder Grimm, Berlin 1985, pp. 14\u201316</ref> Later, they attended local schools.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=2\u20135}}</ref>\n\nIn 1796, Philipp Grimm died of pneumonia, plunging his family into poverty, and they were forced to relinquish their servants and large house. Dorothea depended on financial support from her father and sister, who was the first [[lady-in-waiting]] at the court of [[William I, Elector of Hesse]]. Jacob was the eldest living son, and he was forced at age 11 to assume adult responsibilities (shared with Wilhelm) for the next two years. The two boys adhered to the advice of their grandfather, who continually exhorted them to be industrious.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" />\n\nThe brothers left Steinau and their family in 1798 to attend the ''{{lang|de|[[Friedrichsgymnasium Kassel|Friedrichsgymnasium]]}}'' in [[Kassel]], which had been arranged and paid for by their aunt. By then, they were without a male provider (their grandfather died that year), forcing them to rely entirely on each other, and they became exceptionally close. The two brothers differed in temperament; Jacob was introspective and Wilhelm was outgoing (although he often suffered from ill-health). Sharing a strong work ethic, they excelled in their studies. In Kassel, they became acutely aware of their inferior social status relative to \"high-born\" students who received more attention. Still, each brother graduated at the head of his class: Jacob in 1803 and Wilhelm in 1804.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /><ref name=\"Z(1988)31ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|p=31}}</ref>\n\n=== Kassel ===\nAfter graduation from the ''{{lang|de|Friedrichsgymnasium}}'', the brothers attended the [[University of Marburg]]. The university was small with about 200 students and there they became painfully aware that students of lower social status were not treated equally. They were disqualified from admission because of their social standing and had to request dispensation to study law. Wealthier students received stipends, but the brothers were excluded even from tuition aid. Their poverty kept them from student activities or university social life; ironically, however, their outsider status worked in their favor, and they pursued their studies with extra vigor.<ref name=\"Z(1988)31ff\" />\n\n[[File:Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm.png|thumb|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in an 1843 drawing by their younger brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]]]]\n\nThe brothers were inspired by their law professor [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Friedrich von Savigny]], who awakened in them an interest in history and [[philology]], and they turned to studying [[Middle High German literature|medieval German literature]].<ref name=\"Z(1988)35ff\" /> They shared Savigny's desire to see unification of the 200 German [[Principality|principalities]] into a single state. Through Savigny and his circle of friends\u2014[[German Romanticism|German romantics]] such as [[Clemens Brentano]] and [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]]\u2014the Grimms were introduced to the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who thought that German literature should revert to simpler forms, which he defined as ''{{lang|de|Volkspoesie}}'' (natural poetry) as opposed to ''{{lang|de|Kunstpoesie}}'' (artistic poetry).<ref name=\"Z(2002)7ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|2002|pp=7\u20138}}</ref> The brothers dedicated themselves with great enthusiasm to their studies, about which Wilhelm wrote in his autobiography, \"the ardor with which we studied Old German helped us overcome the spiritual depression of those days.\"<ref name=\"Z(2002)7\">qtd. in {{Harvnb|Zipes|2002|p=7}}</ref>\n\nJacob was still financially responsible for his mother, brother, and younger siblings in 1805, so he accepted a post in Paris as research assistant to von Savigny. On his return to Marburg, he was forced to abandon his studies to support the family, whose poverty was so extreme that food was often scarce. He took a job with the Hessian War Commission. In a letter written to his aunt at this time, Wilhelm wrote of their circumstances, \"We five people eat only three portions and only once a day\".<ref name=\"Z(1988)35ff\">qtd. in {{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|p=35}}</ref>\n\nJacob found full-time employment in 1808 when he was appointed court librarian to the [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|King of Westphalia]] and went on to become librarian in Kassel.<ref name=\"Pitt\">{{cite web |last=Ashliman |first=D.L |title=Grimm Brothers Home Page |authorlink=D.

He arranged and paid for his brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm|Ludwig]]'s studies at art school and for Wilhelm's extended visit to [[Halle (Westfalen)|Halle]] to seek treatment for heart and respiratory ailments, following which Wilhelm joined Jacob as librarian in Kassel.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> The brothers also began collecting folk tales at about this time, in a cursory manner and on Brentano's request. According to Jack Zipes, at this point \"the Grimms were unable to devote all their energies to their research and did not have a clear idea about the significance of collecting folk tales in this initial phase.\"<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" />\n\nDuring their employment as librarians\u2014which paid little but afforded them ample time for research\u2014the brothers experienced a productive period of scholarship, publishing a number of books between 1812 and 1830.<ref name=\"Z218ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|pp=218\u2013219}}</ref> In 1812, they published their first volume of 86 folk tales, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'', followed quickly by two volumes of German legends and a volume of early literary history.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /> They went on to publish works about [[Danish folklore|Danish]] and [[Irish mythology|Irish]] folk tales and [[Norse mythology]], while continuing to edit the German folk tale collection. These works became so widely recognized that the brothers received honorary doctorates from universities in [[Marburg]], [[Berlin]], and Breslau (now [[Wroc\u0142aw]]).<ref name=\"Z218ff\" />\n\n=== G\u00f6ttingen ===\nIn 1825, Wilhelm married Henriette Dorothea (Dortchen) Wild, a long-time family friend and one of a group who supplied them with stories. Jacob never married but continued to live in the household with Wilhelm and Dortchen.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=7\u20139}}</ref> In 1830, both brothers were overlooked when the post of chief librarian came available, which disappointed them greatly.<ref name=\"Z218ff\" /> They moved the household to [[G\u00f6ttingen]] in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] where they took employment at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], Jacob as a professor and head librarian and Wilhelm as professor.<ref name=\"Pitt\" />\n\n[[File:Im Kolleg bei Jacob Grimm 1830.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jacob Grimm lecturing (illustration by [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]], c. 1830)]]\n\nDuring the next seven years, the brothers continued to research, write, and publish. In 1835, Jacob published the well-regarded ''German Mythology'' (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsche Mythologie]]}}''); Wilhelm continued to edit and prepare the third edition of ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' for publication. The two brothers taught  [[German studies]] at the university, becoming well-respected in the newly established discipline.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\nIn 1837, they lost their university posts after joining the rest of the [[G\u00f6ttingen Seven]] in protest. The 1830s were a period of political upheaval and peasant revolt in Germany, leading to the movement for democratic reform known as [[Young Germany]].  The Grimm brothers were not directly aligned with the Young Germans, but five of their colleagues reacted against the demands of [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]], who dissolved the parliament of [[Hanover]] in 1837 and demanded oaths of allegiance from civil servants\u2014including professors at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. For refusing to sign the oath, the seven professors were dismissed and three were deported from Hanover, including Jacob who went to Kassel. He was later joined there by Wilhelm, Dortchen, and their four children.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\nThe brothers were without income in 1838 and again in extreme financial difficulty, so they began what became a lifelong project: the writing of a definitive dictionary. The first volume of their ''German Dictionary'' (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}}'') was not published until 1854. The brothers again depended on friends and supporters for financial assistance and influence in finding employment.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\n=== Berlin and later years ===\n[[File:Graves of the Brothers Grimm at Alter St.-Matth\u00e4us-Kirchhof Berlin 2012.jpg|thumb|The graves of the Brothers Grimm in [[Sch\u00f6neberg]], Berlin (St. Matth\u00e4us Kirchhof Cemetery)]]\n\nIn 1840, von Savigny and Bettina von Arnim appealed successfully to [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] on behalf of the brothers who were offered posts at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]. In addition to teaching posts, the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|Academy of Sciences]] offered them stipends to continue their research. Once they had established their household in Berlin, they directed their efforts towards the work on the German dictionary and continued to publish their research. Jacob turned his attention to researching German legal traditions and the history of the German language, which was published in the late 1840s and early 1850s; meanwhile, Wilhelm began researching [[medieval literature]] while editing new editions of  ''{{lang|de|Hausm\u00e4rchen}}''.<ref name=\"Z218ff\" />\n\nAfter the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], the brothers were elected to the civil parliament. Jacob became a prominent member of the National Assembly at [[Mainz]].<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" /> Their political activities were short-lived, as their hope dwindled for a unified Germany and their disenchantment grew.  In the late 1840s, Jacob resigned his university position and saw the publication of ''The History of the German Language'' (''{{lang|de|Geschichte der deutschen Sprache}}''). Wilhelm continued at his university post until 1852. After retiring from teaching, the brothers devoted themselves to the ''German Dictionary'' for the rest of their lives.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" /> Wilhelm died of an infection in Berlin in 1859,<ref name=\"NG\" /> and Jacob became increasingly reclusive, deeply upset at his brother's death. He continued work on the dictionary until his own death in 1863. Zipes writes of the Grimm brothers' dictionary and of their very large body of work: \"Symbolically the last word was ''{{lang|de|Frucht}}'' (fruit).\"<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\n== Collaborations ==\n\n=== ''Children's and Household Tales'' ===\n{{Main|Grimms' Fairy Tales}}\n\n==== Background ====\nThe rise of [[romanticism]], [[Romantic nationalism]], and trends in valuing popular culture in the early 19th century revived interest in fairy tales, which had declined since their late-17th-century peak.<ref name=\"Jean\" /> [[Johann Karl August Mus\u00e4us]] published a popular collection of tales between 1782 and 1787;<ref name=\"Haase2008\">{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|p=138}}</ref> the Grimms aided the revival with their folklore collection, built on the conviction that a national identity could be found in popular culture and with the common folk (''{{lang|de|Volk}}''). They collected and published their tales as a reflection of German cultural identity. In the first collection, though, they included [[Charles Perrault]]'s tales, published in Paris in 1697 and written for the [[salon (gathering)|literary salons]] of an aristocratic French audience. Scholar Lydie Jean says that Perrault created a myth that his tales came from the common people and reflected existing folklore to justify including them\u2014even though many of them were original.<ref name=\"Jean\" />\n\n[[File:Arthur Rackham Little Red Riding Hood+.jpg|thumb|left|The Grimms defined \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", shown here in an illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]], as representative of a uniquely German tale although it existed in various versions and regions.<ref name=\"Txxxviff\" />]]\n\nThe brothers were directly influenced by Brentano and von Arnim, who edited and adapted the folk songs of ''{{lang|de|[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]}}'' (''The Boy's Magic Horn'' or [[cornucopia]]).<ref name=\"Haase2008\" /> They began the collection with the purpose of creating a scholarly treatise of traditional stories and of preserving the stories as they had been handed from generation to generation\u2014a practice that was threatened by increased industrialization.<ref name=\"Txxxff\" /> [[Maria Tatar]], professor of German studies at [[Harvard University]], explains that it is precisely the handing from generation to generation and the genesis in the [[oral tradition]] that gives folk tales an important mutability. Versions of tales differ from region to region, \"picking up bits and pieces of local culture and lore, drawing a turn of phrase from a song or another story and fleshing out characters with features taken from the audience witnessing their performance.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxvi}}</ref>\n\nHowever, as Tatar explains, the Grimms appropriated stories as being uniquely German, such as \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", which had existed in many versions and regions throughout Europe, because they believed that such stories were reflections of Germanic culture.<ref name=\"Txxxviff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxviii}}</ref> Furthermore, the brothers saw fragments of old religions and faiths reflected in the stories, which they thought continued to exist and survive through the telling of stories.<ref name=\"Murphy3ff\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2000|pp=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\n==== Methodology ====\nWhen Jacob returned to Marburg from Paris in 1806, their friend Brentano sought the brothers' help in adding to his collection of folk tales, at which time the brothers began to gather tales in an organized fashion.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> By 1810, they had produced a manuscript collection of several dozen tales, written after inviting storytellers to their home and transcribing what they heard. These tales were heavily modified in transcription, and many had roots in previously written sources.<ref name=\"H579\">{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|p=579}}</ref> At Brentano's request, they printed and sent him copies of the 53 tales that they collected for inclusion in his third volume of ''{{lang|de|Des Knaben Wunderhorn}}''.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /> Brentano either ignored or forgot about the tales, leaving the copies in a church in [[Alsace]] where they were found in 1920 and became known as the \u00d6lenberg manuscript. It is the earliest extant version of the Grimms' collection and has become a valuable source to scholars studying the development of the Grimms' collection from the time of its inception.

Wilhelm's wife Dortchen Wild and her family, with their nursery maid, told the brothers some of the more well-known tales, such as \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" and \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\".<ref name=\"J177ff\" /> Wilhelm collected a number of tales after befriending [[August von Haxthausen]], whom he visited in 1811 in [[Westphalia]] where he heard stories from von Haxthausen's circle of friends.<ref name=\"Z(1988)11ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=11\u201314}}</ref> Several of the storytellers were of [[Huguenot]] ancestry, telling tales of French origin such as those told to the Grimms by [[Marie Hassenpflug]], an educated woman of French Huguenot ancestry,<ref name=\"H579\" /> and it is probable that these informants were familiar with Perrault's ''{{lang|fr|[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9]]}}'' (''Stories from Past Times'').<ref name=\"Jean\">{{Harvnb|Jean|2007|pp=280\u2013282}}</ref> Other tales were collected from [[Dorothea Viehmann]], the wife of a middle-class tailor and also of French descent.

Moreover, Tatar writes that the brothers' goal of preserving and shaping the tales as something uniquely German at a time of [[Convention of Artlenburg|French occupation]] was a form of \"intellectual resistance\" and, in so doing, they established a methodology for collecting and preserving folklore that set the model followed later by writers throughout Europe during periods of occupation.<ref name=\"Txxxff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxiv\u2013xxxviii}}</ref><ref name=\"B175ff\">{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|pp=175}}</ref>\n\n==== Writing ====\nFrom 1807 onward, the brothers added to the collection. Jacob established the framework, maintained through many iterations; from 1815 until his death, Wilhelm assumed sole responsibility for editing and rewriting the tales. He made the tales stylistically similar, added dialogue, removed pieces \"that might detract from a rustic tone\", improved the plots, and incorporated psychological motifs.<ref name=\"Z(1988)11ff\" /> Ronald Murphy writes in ''The Owl, the Raven and the Dove'' that the brothers\u2014and in particular Wilhelm\u2014also added religious and spiritual motifs to the tales. He believes that Wilhelm \"gleaned\" bits from [[Germanic paganism|old Germanic faiths]], Norse mythology, Roman and [[Greek mythology]], and biblical stories that he reshaped.<ref name=\"Murphy3ff\" />\n\nOver the years, Wilhelm worked extensively on the prose and expanded and added detail to the stories, to the point that many grew to twice the length they were in the earliest published editions.<ref name=\"T(2004)xiff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xi\u2013xiii}}</ref> In the later editions, Wilhelm polished the language to make it more enticing to a bourgeois audience, eliminated sexual elements, and added Christian elements. After 1819, he began writing for children (children were not initially considered the primary audience), adding entirely new tales or adding new elements to existing tales, elements that were often strongly didactic.<ref name=\"Z(1988)11ff\" />\n\nSome changes were made in light of unfavorable reviews, particularly from those who objected that not all the tales were suitable for children because of scenes of violence and sexuality.<ref name=\"T(1987)15ff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|1987|pp=15\u201317}}</ref> He worked to modify plots for many stories; for example, \"[[Rapunzel]]\" in the first edition of ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' clearly shows a sexual relationship between the prince and the girl in the tower, which he edited out in subsequent editions.<ref name=\"T(2004)xiff\" /> Tatar writes that morals were added (in the second edition, a king's regret was added to the scene in which his wife is to be burned at the stake) and often the characters in the tale were amended to appear more German: \"every [[fairy]] (''{{lang|de|Fee}}''), prince (''{{lang|de|Prinz}}'') and princess (''{{lang|de|Prinzessin}}'')\u2014all words of French origin\u2014was transformed into a more Teutonic-sounding enchantress (''{{lang|de|Zauberin}}'') or wise woman (''{{lang|de|weise Frau}}''), king's son (''{{lang|de|K\u00f6nigssohn}}''), king's daughter (''{{lang|de|K\u00f6nigstochter}}'').\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tatar|1987|p=31}}</ref>\n\n==== Themes and analysis ====\nThe Grimms' legacy contains legends, [[novella]]s, and folk stories, the vast majority of which were not intended as children's tales. Von Armin was deeply concerned about the content of some of the tales, such as those that showed children being eaten, and suggested that they be removed. Instead, the brothers added an introduction with cautionary advice that parents steer children toward age-appropriate stories. Despite von Armin's unease, none of the tales were eliminated from the collection, in the brothers' belief that all the tales were of value and reflected inherent cultural qualities. Furthermore, the stories were didactic in nature at a time when discipline relied on fear, according to scholar [[Linda D\u00e9gh]], who explains that tales such as \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\" and \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" were written as \"warning tales\" for children.<ref name=\"D91ff\">{{Harvnb|D\u00e9gh|1979|pp=91\u201393}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|left|\"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\", illustrated by [[Arthur Rackham]], was a \"warning tale\" for children.<ref name=\"D91ff\" />]]\n\nThe stories in ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' include scenes of violence that have since been sanitized. For example, in the Grimms' original version of \"[[Snow White]]\", the Queen is Little Snow White's mother, not her stepmother, yet even so she orders her Huntsman to kill Snow White (her biological daughter) and bring home the child's lungs and liver so that she can eat them. The story ends with the Queen mother dancing at Snow White's wedding wearing a pair of red-hot iron shoes that kill her.<ref>Jack Zipes's translation of the 1812 original edition of \"Folk and Fairy Tales\"</ref> Another story (\"The Goose Girl\") has a servant being stripped naked and pushed into a barrel \"studded with sharp nails\" pointing inwards and then rolled down the street.<ref name=\"NG\" /> The Grimms' version of \"[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]\" describes the princess throwing the frog against a wall instead of kissing him. To some extent, the cruelty and violence may have been a reflection of medieval culture from which the tales originated, such as scenes of witches burning, as described in \"[[The Six Swans]]\".<ref name=\"NG\" />\n\nTales with a spinning [[motif (folkloristics)|motif]] are broadly represented in the collection. In her essay \"Tale Spinners: Submerged Voices in Grimms' Fairy Tales\", children's literature scholar Bottigheimer explains that these stories reflect the degree to which spinning was crucial in the life of women in the 19th century and earlier. Spinning, and particularly the spinning of [[flax]], was commonly performed in the home by women. Many stories begin by describing the occupation of a main character, as in \"There once was a miller\", yet spinning is never mentioned as an occupation, probably because the brothers did not consider it an occupation. Instead, spinning was a communal activity, frequently performed in a ''{{lang|de|Spinnstube}}'' (spinning room), a place where women most likely kept the oral traditions alive by telling stories while engaged in tedious work.<ref name=\"B142ff\">{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|pp=142\u2013146}}</ref> In the stories, a woman's personality is often represented by her attitude toward spinning; a wise woman might be a spinster and Bottigheimer explains that the [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] was the symbol of a \"diligent, well-ordered womanhood.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|p=143}}</ref> In some stories, such as \"[[Rumpelstiltskin]]\", spinning is associated with a threat; in others, spinning might be avoided by a character who is either too lazy or not accustomed to spinning because of her high social status.<ref name=\"B142ff\" /><!-- this needs more work; or develop in the KHM article -->\n\nThe tales were also criticized for being insufficiently German, which influenced the tales that the brothers included as well as their use of language. Scholars such as Heinz R\u00f6lleke say that the stories are an accurate depiction of German culture, showing \"rustic simplicity [and] sexual modesty.\"<ref name=\"NG\" /> German culture is deeply rooted in the forest (''{{lang|de|wald}}''), a dark dangerous place to be avoided, most particularly the old forests with large oak trees and yet a place where Little Red Riding Hood's mother sent her daughter to deliver food to her grandmother's house.<ref name=\"NG\" /><!-- either something got lost here or it needs expansion -->\n\n[[File:Rumpelstiltskin-Crane1886.jpg|thumb|300px|\"[[Rumpelstiltskin]]\", shown here in an illustrated border by [[Walter Crane]], is an example of a \"spinning tale\".]]\n\nSome critics such as Alistair Hauke use [[Analytical psychology|Jungian analysis]] to say that the deaths of the brothers' father and grandfather are the reason for the Grimms' tendency to idealize and excuse fathers, as well as the predominance of female villains in the tales, such as the [[wicked stepmother]] and stepsisters in \"Cinderella\", but this disregards the fact that they were collectors, not authors of the tales.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alister|Hauke|1998|pp=216\u2013219}}</ref> Another possible influence is found in stories such as \"[[The Twelve Brothers]]\", which mirrors the brothers' family structure of several brothers facing and overcoming opposition.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|p=37}}</ref> Autobiographical elements exist in some of the tales, and according to Zipes the work may have been a \"quest\" to replace the family life lost after their father died. The collection includes 41 tales about siblings, which Zipes says are representative of Jacob and Wilhelm. Many of the sibling stories follow a simple plot where the characters lose a home, work industriously at a specific task and, in the end, find a new home.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=39\u201342}}</ref>\n\n==== Editions ====\nBetween 1812 and 1864, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' was published 17 times: seven of the \"Large edition\" (''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfe Ausgabe}}'') and ten of the \"Small edition\" (''{{lang|de|Kleine Ausgabe}}''). The Large editions contained all the tales collected to date, extensive annotations, and scholarly notes written by the brothers; the Small editions had only 50 tales and were intended for children. Jacob and Wilhelm's younger brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm|Emil Grimm]] illustrated the Small editions, adding Christian symbolism to the drawings, such as depicting Cinderella's mother as an angel, and adding a Bible to the bedside table of Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother.<ref name=\"Z218ff\" />\n\n[[File:Kinder title page.jpg|thumb|300px|Frontispiece and title-page, illustrated by [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]] of the 1819 edition of ''{{lang|de|[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen]]}}'']]\n[[File:Grimm - Deutsche Sagen, 1912 - 2558595 F.jpeg|thumb|upright|''Deutsche Sagen'', 1912]]\n\nThe first volume was published in 1812 with 86 folk tales,<ref name=\"J177ff\">{{Harvnb|Joosen|2006|pp=177\u2013179}}</ref> and a second volume with 70 additional tales was published late in 1814 (dated 1815 on the title page); together, the two volumes and their 156 tales are considered the first of the Large (annotated) editions.<ref name=\"Michaelis-Jena\" /><ref name=\"Z(2000)276ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|pp=276\u2013278}}</ref> A second expanded edition with 170 tales was published in 1819, followed in 1822 by a volume of scholarly commentary and annotations.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /><ref name=\"T(1987)15ff\" /> Five more Large editions were published in 1837, 1840, 1843, 1850, and 1857.

They moved away from Brentano's practice\u2014and that of the other romanticists\u2014who frequently changed original oral styles of folk tale to a more literary style, which the brothers considered artificial.

''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]'' follows a detective who discovers he is a Grimm, the latest in a line of guardians who are sworn to keep the balance between humanity and mythological creatures. ''[[Ever After High]]'' imagines Grimm Brothers (here descendants called Milton and Giles) as headmasters of Ever After High boarding school where they train the children of the previous generation of fairy tales to follow in their parents' footsteps. The ''[[The 10th Kingdom|10th Kingdom]]'' mini series states that the brothers were trapped in the fairy tale world for years where they witnessed the events of their stories before finally making it back to the real world. ''[[The Sisters Grimm]]'' book series follows their descendants, Sabrina and Daphne, as they adapt to life in Ferryport Landing, a town in upstate New York populated by fairy tale people. Separate from the previous series are ''[[The Land of Stories]]'' and ''its'' Sisters Grimm, a self described [[coven]] determined to track down and document creatures from the fairy tale world that cross over into the real world.

They were among the first and best-known collectors of German and European folk tales, and popularized traditional oral tale types such as \"[[Cinderella]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Aschenputtel}}\"), \"[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Der Froschk\u00f6nig}}\"), \"[[The Goose-Girl]]\" (\"Die G\u00e4nsemagd\"), \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" (\"{{lang|de|H\u00e4nsel und Gretel}}\"), \"[[Rapunzel]]\", \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\", \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", \"[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats]]\", \"[[The Three Little Pigs]]\", \"[[Rumpelstiltskin]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Rumpelstilzchen}}\"), \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Dornr\u00f6schen}}\"), and \"[[Snow White]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Schneewittchen}}\"). Their classic collection, ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Children's and Household Tales]]'' (''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}''), was published in two volumes\u2014the first in 1812 and the second in 1815.\n\nThe brothers were born in the town of [[Hanau]] in [[Hesse-Cassel]] (now Germany) and spent most of their childhood in the nearby town of [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe|Steinau]]. Their father's death in 1796 impoverished  the family and affected the brothers for many years after. They attended the [[University of Marburg]] where they began a lifelong dedication to researching the early history of German language and literature, including German [[Oral tradition|folktales]]. The rise of [[Romanticism]] during the 18th century had revived interest in traditional folk stories, which to the Grimms and their colleagues represented a pure form of national literature and culture. The Brothers Grimm established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for [[folkloristics|folklore studies]]. Between the first edition of 1812\u20131815 and the seventh (and final) edition of 1857, they revised their collection many times, so that it grew from 156 stories to more than 200.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The original folk & fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm : the complete first edition|others=Grimm, Wilhelm, 1786-1859,, Grimm, Jacob, 1785-1863,, Zipes, Jack, 1937-, Dezs\u00f6, Andrea|isbn=9780691160597|location=Princeton [New Jersey]|oclc=879662315|year = 2014}}</ref> In addition to collecting and editing folk tales, the brothers compiled German legends. Individually, they published a large body of linguistic and literary scholarship. Together, in 1838, they began work on a massive historical German dictionary (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}}'') which, in their lifetimes, they completed only as far as the word ''Frucht'' ('fruit').\n\nMany of the Grimms' folk tales have enjoyed enduring popularity. The tales are available in more than 100 languages and have been adapted by filmmakers including [[Lotte Reiniger]] and [[Walt Disney]], with films such as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''. During the 1930s and 40s, the tales were used as propaganda by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]; later in the 20th century, psychologists such as [[Bruno Bettelheim]] reaffirmed the value of the work, in spite of the cruelty and violence in original versions of some of the tales (which the Grimms eventually sanitized).\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:SteinauBGHFrosch retouched.jpg|thumb|left|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm lived in this house in [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe|Steinau]] from 1791 to 1796.]]\n[[Jacob Grimm|Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm]] was born on 4&nbsp;January 1785, and his brother [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm Carl Grimm]] was born on 24&nbsp;February 1786. Both were born in [[Hanau]], in the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (present-day Germany), to [[Philipp Grimm|Philipp Wilhelm Grimm]], a [[jurist]], and Dorothea Grimm n\u00e9e Zimmer, daughter of a [[Kassel]] city councilman.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> They were the second- and third-eldest surviving siblings in a family of nine children, three of whom died in infancy.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /><ref>Frederick Herman George ({{lang|de|Friedrich Hermann Georg}}; 12 December 1783&nbsp;\u2013 16 March 1784), [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]], [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]], Carl Frederick ({{lang|de|Carl Friedrich}}; 24 April 1787&nbsp;\u2013 25 May 1852), Ferdinand Philip ({{lang|de|Ferdinand Philipp}}; 18 December 1788&nbsp;\u2013 6 January 1845), Louis Emil ({{lang|de|Ludwig Emil}}; 14 March 1790&nbsp;\u2013 4 April 1863), Frederick ({{lang|de|Friedrich}}; 15 June 1791&nbsp;\u2013 20 August 1792), Charlotte \"Lotte\" Amalie (10 May 1793&nbsp;\u2013 15 June 1833) and George Edward ({{lang|de|Georg Eduard}}; 26 July 1794&nbsp;\u2013 19 April 1795).</ref><ref name=\"Michaelis-Jena-9\">{{Harvnb|Michaelis-Jena|1970|p=9}}</ref> In 1791, the family moved to the countryside town of [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe|Steinau]], when Philipp was employed there as district [[magistrate]] (''{{lang|de|[[Amtmann]]}}'').  The family became prominent members of the community, residing in a large home surrounded by fields. Biographer [[Jack Zipes]] writes that the brothers were happy in Steinau and \"clearly fond of country life\".<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> The children were educated at home by private tutors, receiving strict instruction as [[Lutherans]] that instilled in both a lifelong religious faith.<ref>Herbert Scurla: Die Br\u00fcder Grimm, Berlin 1985, pp. 14\u201316</ref> Later, they attended local schools.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=2\u20135}}</ref>\n\nIn 1796, Philipp Grimm died of pneumonia, plunging his family into poverty, and they were forced to relinquish their servants and large house. Dorothea depended on financial support from her father and sister, who was the first [[lady-in-waiting]] at the court of [[William I, Elector of Hesse]]. Jacob was the eldest living son, and he was forced at age 11 to assume adult responsibilities (shared with Wilhelm) for the next two years. The two boys adhered to the advice of their grandfather, who continually exhorted them to be industrious.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" />\n\nThe brothers left Steinau and their family in 1798 to attend the ''{{lang|de|[[Friedrichsgymnasium Kassel|Friedrichsgymnasium]]}}'' in [[Kassel]], which had been arranged and paid for by their aunt. By then, they were without a male provider (their grandfather died that year), forcing them to rely entirely on each other, and they became exceptionally close. The two brothers differed in temperament; Jacob was introspective and Wilhelm was outgoing (although he often suffered from ill-health). Sharing a strong work ethic, they excelled in their studies. In Kassel, they became acutely aware of their inferior social status relative to \"high-born\" students who received more attention. Still, each brother graduated at the head of his class: Jacob in 1803 and Wilhelm in 1804.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /><ref name=\"Z(1988)31ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|p=31}}</ref>\n\n=== Kassel ===\nAfter graduation from the ''{{lang|de|Friedrichsgymnasium}}'', the brothers attended the [[University of Marburg]]. The university was small with about 200 students and there they became painfully aware that students of lower social status were not treated equally. They were disqualified from admission because of their social standing and had to request dispensation to study law. Wealthier students received stipends, but the brothers were excluded even from tuition aid. Their poverty kept them from student activities or university social life; ironically, however, their outsider status worked in their favor, and they pursued their studies with extra vigor.<ref name=\"Z(1988)31ff\" />\n\n[[File:Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm.png|thumb|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in an 1843 drawing by their younger brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]]]]\n\nThe brothers were inspired by their law professor [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Friedrich von Savigny]], who awakened in them an interest in history and [[philology]], and they turned to studying [[Middle High German literature|medieval German literature]].<ref name=\"Z(1988)35ff\" /> They shared Savigny's desire to see unification of the 200 German [[Principality|principalities]] into a single state. Through Savigny and his circle of friends\u2014[[German Romanticism|German romantics]] such as [[Clemens Brentano]] and [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]]\u2014the Grimms were introduced to the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who thought that German literature should revert to simpler forms, which he defined as ''{{lang|de|Volkspoesie}}'' (natural poetry) as opposed to ''{{lang|de|Kunstpoesie}}'' (artistic poetry).<ref name=\"Z(2002)7ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|2002|pp=7\u20138}}</ref> The brothers dedicated themselves with great enthusiasm to their studies, about which Wilhelm wrote in his autobiography, \"the ardor with which we studied Old German helped us overcome the spiritual depression of those days.\"<ref name=\"Z(2002)7\">qtd. in {{Harvnb|Zipes|2002|p=7}}</ref>\n\nJacob was still financially responsible for his mother, brother, and younger siblings in 1805, so he accepted a post in Paris as research assistant to von Savigny. On his return to Marburg, he was forced to abandon his studies to support the family, whose poverty was so extreme that food was often scarce. He took a job with the Hessian War Commission. In a letter written to his aunt at this time, Wilhelm wrote of their circumstances, \"We five people eat only three portions and only once a day\".<ref name=\"Z(1988)35ff\">qtd. in {{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|p=35}}</ref>\n\nJacob found full-time employment in 1808 when he was appointed court librarian to the [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|King of Westphalia]] and went on to become librarian in Kassel.<ref name=\"Pitt\">{{cite web |last=Ashliman |first=D.L |title=Grimm Brothers Home Page |authorlink=D.

Ashliman|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm.html |publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]] |accessdate=11 March 2012 }}</ref> After their mother's death that year, he became fully responsible for his younger siblings. He arranged and paid for his brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm|Ludwig]]'s studies at art school and for Wilhelm's extended visit to [[Halle (Westfalen)|Halle]] to seek treatment for heart and respiratory ailments, following which Wilhelm joined Jacob as librarian in Kassel.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> The brothers also began collecting folk tales at about this time, in a cursory manner and on Brentano's request. According to Jack Zipes, at this point \"the Grimms were unable to devote all their energies to their research and did not have a clear idea about the significance of collecting folk tales in this initial phase.\"<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" />\n\nDuring their employment as librarians\u2014which paid little but afforded them ample time for research\u2014the brothers experienced a productive period of scholarship, publishing a number of books between 1812 and 1830.<ref name=\"Z218ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|pp=218\u2013219}}</ref> In 1812, they published their first volume of 86 folk tales, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'', followed quickly by two volumes of German legends and a volume of early literary history.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /> They went on to publish works about [[Danish folklore|Danish]] and [[Irish mythology|Irish]] folk tales and [[Norse mythology]], while continuing to edit the German folk tale collection. These works became so widely recognized that the brothers received honorary doctorates from universities in [[Marburg]], [[Berlin]], and Breslau (now [[Wroc\u0142aw]]).<ref name=\"Z218ff\" />\n\n=== G\u00f6ttingen ===\nIn 1825, Wilhelm married Henriette Dorothea (Dortchen) Wild, a long-time family friend and one of a group who supplied them with stories. Jacob never married but continued to live in the household with Wilhelm and Dortchen.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=7\u20139}}</ref> In 1830, both brothers were overlooked when the post of chief librarian came available, which disappointed them greatly.<ref name=\"Z218ff\" /> They moved the household to [[G\u00f6ttingen]] in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] where they took employment at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], Jacob as a professor and head librarian and Wilhelm as professor.<ref name=\"Pitt\" />\n\n[[File:Im Kolleg bei Jacob Grimm 1830.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jacob Grimm lecturing (illustration by [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]], c. 1830)]]\n\nDuring the next seven years, the brothers continued to research, write, and publish. In 1835, Jacob published the well-regarded ''German Mythology'' (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsche Mythologie]]}}''); Wilhelm continued to edit and prepare the third edition of ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' for publication. The two brothers taught  [[German studies]] at the university, becoming well-respected in the newly established discipline.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\nIn 1837, they lost their university posts after joining the rest of the [[G\u00f6ttingen Seven]] in protest. The 1830s were a period of political upheaval and peasant revolt in Germany, leading to the movement for democratic reform known as [[Young Germany]].  The Grimm brothers were not directly aligned with the Young Germans, but five of their colleagues reacted against the demands of [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]], who dissolved the parliament of [[Hanover]] in 1837 and demanded oaths of allegiance from civil servants\u2014including professors at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. For refusing to sign the oath, the seven professors were dismissed and three were deported from Hanover, including Jacob who went to Kassel. He was later joined there by Wilhelm, Dortchen, and their four children.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\nThe brothers were without income in 1838 and again in extreme financial difficulty, so they began what became a lifelong project: the writing of a definitive dictionary. The first volume of their ''German Dictionary'' (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}}'') was not published until 1854. The brothers again depended on friends and supporters for financial assistance and influence in finding employment.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\n=== Berlin and later years ===\n[[File:Graves of the Brothers Grimm at Alter St.-Matth\u00e4us-Kirchhof Berlin 2012.jpg|thumb|The graves of the Brothers Grimm in [[Sch\u00f6neberg]], Berlin (St. Matth\u00e4us Kirchhof Cemetery)]]\n\nIn 1840, von Savigny and Bettina von Arnim appealed successfully to [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] on behalf of the brothers who were offered posts at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]. In addition to teaching posts, the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|Academy of Sciences]] offered them stipends to continue their research. Once they had established their household in Berlin, they directed their efforts towards the work on the German dictionary and continued to publish their research. Jacob turned his attention to researching German legal traditions and the history of the German language, which was published in the late 1840s and early 1850s; meanwhile, Wilhelm began researching [[medieval literature]] while editing new editions of  ''{{lang|de|Hausm\u00e4rchen}}''.<ref name=\"Z218ff\" />\n\nAfter the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], the brothers were elected to the civil parliament. Jacob became a prominent member of the National Assembly at [[Mainz]].<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" /> Their political activities were short-lived, as their hope dwindled for a unified Germany and their disenchantment grew.  In the late 1840s, Jacob resigned his university position and saw the publication of ''The History of the German Language'' (''{{lang|de|Geschichte der deutschen Sprache}}''). Wilhelm continued at his university post until 1852. After retiring from teaching, the brothers devoted themselves to the ''German Dictionary'' for the rest of their lives.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" /> Wilhelm died of an infection in Berlin in 1859,<ref name=\"NG\" /> and Jacob became increasingly reclusive, deeply upset at his brother's death. He continued work on the dictionary until his own death in 1863. Zipes writes of the Grimm brothers' dictionary and of their very large body of work: \"Symbolically the last word was ''{{lang|de|Frucht}}'' (fruit).\"<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\n== Collaborations ==\n\n=== ''Children's and Household Tales'' ===\n{{Main|Grimms' Fairy Tales}}\n\n==== Background ====\nThe rise of [[romanticism]], [[Romantic nationalism]], and trends in valuing popular culture in the early 19th century revived interest in fairy tales, which had declined since their late-17th-century peak.<ref name=\"Jean\" /> [[Johann Karl August Mus\u00e4us]] published a popular collection of tales between 1782 and 1787;<ref name=\"Haase2008\">{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|p=138}}</ref> the Grimms aided the revival with their folklore collection, built on the conviction that a national identity could be found in popular culture and with the common folk (''{{lang|de|Volk}}''). They collected and published their tales as a reflection of German cultural identity. In the first collection, though, they included [[Charles Perrault]]'s tales, published in Paris in 1697 and written for the [[salon (gathering)|literary salons]] of an aristocratic French audience. Scholar Lydie Jean says that Perrault created a myth that his tales came from the common people and reflected existing folklore to justify including them\u2014even though many of them were original.<ref name=\"Jean\" />\n\n[[File:Arthur Rackham Little Red Riding Hood+.jpg|thumb|left|The Grimms defined \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", shown here in an illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]], as representative of a uniquely German tale although it existed in various versions and regions.<ref name=\"Txxxviff\" />]]\n\nThe brothers were directly influenced by Brentano and von Arnim, who edited and adapted the folk songs of ''{{lang|de|[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]}}'' (''The Boy's Magic Horn'' or [[cornucopia]]).<ref name=\"Haase2008\" /> They began the collection with the purpose of creating a scholarly treatise of traditional stories and of preserving the stories as they had been handed from generation to generation\u2014a practice that was threatened by increased industrialization.<ref name=\"Txxxff\" /> [[Maria Tatar]], professor of German studies at [[Harvard University]], explains that it is precisely the handing from generation to generation and the genesis in the [[oral tradition]] that gives folk tales an important mutability. Versions of tales differ from region to region, \"picking up bits and pieces of local culture and lore, drawing a turn of phrase from a song or another story and fleshing out characters with features taken from the audience witnessing their performance.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxvi}}</ref>\n\nHowever, as Tatar explains, the Grimms appropriated stories as being uniquely German, such as \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", which had existed in many versions and regions throughout Europe, because they believed that such stories were reflections of Germanic culture.<ref name=\"Txxxviff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxviii}}</ref> Furthermore, the brothers saw fragments of old religions and faiths reflected in the stories, which they thought continued to exist and survive through the telling of stories.<ref name=\"Murphy3ff\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2000|pp=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\n==== Methodology ====\nWhen Jacob returned to Marburg from Paris in 1806, their friend Brentano sought the brothers' help in adding to his collection of folk tales, at which time the brothers began to gather tales in an organized fashion.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> By 1810, they had produced a manuscript collection of several dozen tales, written after inviting storytellers to their home and transcribing what they heard. These tales were heavily modified in transcription, and many had roots in previously written sources.<ref name=\"H579\">{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|p=579}}</ref> At Brentano's request, they printed and sent him copies of the 53 tales that they collected for inclusion in his third volume of ''{{lang|de|Des Knaben Wunderhorn}}''.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /> Brentano either ignored or forgot about the tales, leaving the copies in a church in [[Alsace]] where they were found in 1920 and became known as the \u00d6lenberg manuscript. It is the earliest extant version of the Grimms' collection and has become a valuable source to scholars studying the development of the Grimms' collection from the time of its inception. The manuscript was published in 1927 and again in 1975.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|p=62}}</ref>\n\nThe brothers gained a reputation for collecting tales from peasants, although many tales came from middle-class or aristocratic acquaintances. Wilhelm's wife Dortchen Wild and her family, with their nursery maid, told the brothers some of the more well-known tales, such as \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" and \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\".<ref name=\"J177ff\" /> Wilhelm collected a number of tales after befriending [[August von Haxthausen]], whom he visited in 1811 in [[Westphalia]] where he heard stories from von Haxthausen's circle of friends.<ref name=\"Z(1988)11ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=11\u201314}}</ref> Several of the storytellers were of [[Huguenot]] ancestry, telling tales of French origin such as those told to the Grimms by Marie Hassenpflug, an educated woman of French Huguenot ancestry,<ref name=\"H579\" /> and it is probable that these informants were familiar with Perrault's ''{{lang|fr|[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9]]}}'' (''Stories from Past Times'').<ref name=\"Jean\">{{Harvnb|Jean|2007|pp=280\u2013282}}</ref> Other tales were collected from [[Dorothea Viehmann]], the wife of a middle-class tailor and also of French descent. Despite her middle-class background, in the first English translation she was characterized as a peasant and given the name ''{{lang|de|Gammer Gretel}}''.<ref name=\"Txxxff\" />\n\n[[File:Walter Crane12.jpg|thumb|Stories such as \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\", shown here in a [[Walter Crane]] illustration, had been previously published and were rewritten by the Brothers Grimm.<ref name=\"Jean\" />]]\n\nAccording to scholars such as Ruth Bottigheimer and [[Maria Tatar]], some of the tales probably originated in written form during the [[Middle ages|medieval period]] with writers such as [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola|Straparola]] and [[Boccaccio]], but were modified in the 17th century and again rewritten by the Grimms. Moreover, Tatar writes that the brothers' goal of preserving and shaping the tales as something uniquely German at a time of [[Convention of Artlenburg|French occupation]] was a form of \"intellectual resistance\" and, in so doing, they established a methodology for collecting and preserving folklore that set the model followed later by writers throughout Europe during periods of occupation.<ref name=\"Txxxff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxiv\u2013xxxviii}}</ref><ref name=\"B175ff\">{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|pp=175}}</ref>\n\n==== Writing ====\nFrom 1807 onward, the brothers added to the collection. Jacob established the framework, maintained through many iterations; from 1815 until his death, Wilhelm assumed sole responsibility for editing and rewriting the tales. He made the tales stylistically similar, added dialogue, removed pieces \"that might detract from a rustic tone\", improved the plots, and incorporated psychological motifs.<ref name=\"Z(1988)11ff\" /> Ronald Murphy writes in ''The Owl, the Raven and the Dove'' that the brothers\u2014and in particular Wilhelm\u2014also added religious and spiritual motifs to the tales. He believes that Wilhelm \"gleaned\" bits from [[Germanic paganism|old Germanic faiths]], Norse mythology, Roman and [[Greek mythology]], and biblical stories that he reshaped.<ref name=\"Murphy3ff\" />\n\nOver the years, Wilhelm worked extensively on the prose and expanded and added detail to the stories, to the point that many grew to twice the length they were in the earliest published editions.<ref name=\"T(2004)xiff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xi\u2013xiii}}</ref> In the later editions, Wilhelm polished the language to make it more enticing to a bourgeois audience, eliminated sexual elements, and added Christian elements. After 1819, he began writing for children (children were not initially considered the primary audience), adding entirely new tales or adding new elements to existing tales, elements that were often strongly didactic.<ref name=\"Z(1988)11ff\" />\n\nSome changes were made in light of unfavorable reviews, particularly from those who objected that not all the tales were suitable for children because of scenes of violence and sexuality.<ref name=\"T(1987)15ff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|1987|pp=15\u201317}}</ref> He worked to modify plots for many stories; for example, \"[[Rapunzel]]\" in the first edition of ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' clearly shows a sexual relationship between the prince and the girl in the tower, which he edited out in subsequent editions.<ref name=\"T(2004)xiff\" /> Tatar writes that morals were added (in the second edition, a king's regret was added to the scene in which his wife is to be burned at the stake) and often the characters in the tale were amended to appear more German: \"every [[fairy]] (''{{lang|de|Fee}}''), prince (''{{lang|de|Prinz}}'') and princess (''{{lang|de|Prinzessin}}'')\u2014all words of French origin\u2014was transformed into a more Teutonic-sounding enchantress (''{{lang|de|Zauberin}}'') or wise woman (''{{lang|de|weise Frau}}''), king's son (''{{lang|de|K\u00f6nigssohn}}''), king's daughter (''{{lang|de|K\u00f6nigstochter}}'').\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tatar|1987|p=31}}</ref>\n\n==== Themes and analysis ====\nThe Grimms' legacy contains legends, [[novella]]s, and folk stories, the vast majority of which were not intended as children's tales. Von Armin was deeply concerned about the content of some of the tales, such as those that showed children being eaten, and suggested that they be removed. Instead, the brothers added an introduction with cautionary advice that parents steer children toward age-appropriate stories. Despite von Armin's unease, none of the tales were eliminated from the collection, in the brothers' belief that all the tales were of value and reflected inherent cultural qualities. Furthermore, the stories were didactic in nature at a time when discipline relied on fear, according to scholar [[Linda D\u00e9gh]], who explains that tales such as \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\" and \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" were written as \"warning tales\" for children.<ref name=\"D91ff\">{{Harvnb|D\u00e9gh|1979|pp=91\u201393}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|left|\"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\", illustrated by [[Arthur Rackham]], was a \"warning tale\" for children.<ref name=\"D91ff\" />]]\n\nThe stories in ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' include scenes of violence that have since been sanitized. For example, in the Grimms' original version of \"[[Snow White]]\", the Queen is Little Snow White's mother, not her stepmother, yet even so she orders her Huntsman to kill Snow White (her biological daughter) and bring home the child's lungs and liver so that she can eat them. The story ends with the Queen mother dancing at Snow White's wedding wearing a pair of red-hot iron shoes that kill her.<ref>Jack Zipes's translation of the 1812 original edition of \"Folk and Fairy Tales\"</ref> Another story (\"The Goose Girl\") has a servant being stripped naked and pushed into a barrel \"studded with sharp nails\" pointing inwards and then rolled down the street.<ref name=\"NG\" /> The Grimms' version of \"[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]\" describes the princess throwing the frog against a wall instead of kissing him. To some extent, the cruelty and violence may have been a reflection of medieval culture from which the tales originated, such as scenes of witches burning, as described in \"[[The Six Swans]]\".<ref name=\"NG\" />\n\nTales with a spinning [[motif (folkloristics)|motif]] are broadly represented in the collection. In her essay \"Tale Spinners: Submerged Voices in Grimms' Fairy Tales\", children's literature scholar Bottigheimer explains that these stories reflect the degree to which spinning was crucial in the life of women in the 19th century and earlier. Spinning, and particularly the spinning of [[flax]], was commonly performed in the home by women. Many stories begin by describing the occupation of a main character, as in \"There once was a miller\", yet spinning is never mentioned as an occupation, probably because the brothers did not consider it an occupation. Instead, spinning was a communal activity, frequently performed in a ''{{lang|de|Spinnstube}}'' (spinning room), a place where women most likely kept the oral traditions alive by telling stories while engaged in tedious work.<ref name=\"B142ff\">{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|pp=142\u2013146}}</ref> In the stories, a woman's personality is often represented by her attitude toward spinning; a wise woman might be a spinster and Bottigheimer explains that the [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] was the symbol of a \"diligent, well-ordered womanhood.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|p=143}}</ref> In some stories, such as \"[[Rumpelstiltskin]]\", spinning is associated with a threat; in others, spinning might be avoided by a character who is either too lazy or not accustomed to spinning because of her high social status.<ref name=\"B142ff\" /><!-- this needs more work; or develop in the KHM article -->\n\nThe tales were also criticized for being insufficiently German, which influenced the tales that the brothers included as well as their use of language. Scholars such as Heinz R\u00f6lleke say that the stories are an accurate depiction of German culture, showing \"rustic simplicity [and] sexual modesty.\"<ref name=\"NG\" /> German culture is deeply rooted in the forest (''{{lang|de|wald}}''), a dark dangerous place to be avoided, most particularly the old forests with large oak trees and yet a place where Little Red Riding Hood's mother sent her daughter to deliver food to her grandmother's house.<ref name=\"NG\" /><!-- either something got lost here or it needs expansion -->\n\n[[File:Rumpelstiltskin-Crane1886.jpg|thumb|300px|\"[[Rumpelstiltskin]]\", shown here in an illustrated border by [[Walter Crane]], is an example of a \"spinning tale\".]]\n\nSome critics such as Alistair Hauke use [[Analytical psychology|Jungian analysis]] to say that the deaths of the brothers' father and grandfather are the reason for the Grimms' tendency to idealize and excuse fathers, as well as the predominance of female villains in the tales, such as the [[wicked stepmother]] and stepsisters in \"Cinderella\", but this disregards the fact that they were collectors, not authors of the tales.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alister|Hauke|1998|pp=216\u2013219}}</ref> Another possible influence is found in stories such as \"[[The Twelve Brothers]]\", which mirrors the brothers' family structure of several brothers facing and overcoming opposition.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|p=37}}</ref> Autobiographical elements exist in some of the tales, and according to Zipes the work may have been a \"quest\" to replace the family life lost after their father died. The collection includes 41 tales about siblings, which Zipes says are representative of Jacob and Wilhelm. Many of the sibling stories follow a simple plot where the characters lose a home, work industriously at a specific task and, in the end, find a new home.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=39\u201342}}</ref>\n\n==== Editions ====\nBetween 1812 and 1864, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' was published 17 times: seven of the \"Large edition\" (''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfe Ausgabe}}'') and ten of the \"Small edition\" (''{{lang|de|Kleine Ausgabe}}''). The Large editions contained all the tales collected to date, extensive annotations, and scholarly notes written by the brothers; the Small editions had only 50 tales and were intended for children. Jacob and Wilhelm's younger brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm|Emil Grimm]] illustrated the Small editions, adding Christian symbolism to the drawings, such as depicting Cinderella's mother as an angel, and adding a Bible to the bedside table of Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother.<ref name=\"Z218ff\" />\n\n[[File:Kinder title page.jpg|thumb|300px|Frontispiece and title-page, illustrated by [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]] of the 1819 edition of ''{{lang|de|[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen]]}}'']]\n[[File:Grimm - Deutsche Sagen, 1912 - 2558595 F.jpeg|thumb|upright|''Deutsche Sagen'', 1912]]\n\nThe first volume was published in 1812 with 86 folk tales,<ref name=\"J177ff\">{{Harvnb|Joosen|2006|pp=177\u2013179}}</ref> and a second volume with 70 additional tales was published late in 1814 (dated 1815 on the title page); together, the two volumes and their 156 tales are considered the first of the Large (annotated) editions.<ref name=\"Michaelis-Jena\" /><ref name=\"Z(2000)276ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|pp=276\u2013278}}</ref> A second expanded edition with 170 tales was published in 1819, followed in 1822 by a volume of scholarly commentary and annotations.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /><ref name=\"T(1987)15ff\" /> Five more Large editions were published in 1837, 1840, 1843, 1850, and 1857.

They moved away from Brentano's practice\u2014and that of the other romanticists\u2014who frequently changed original oral styles of folk tale to a more literary style, which the brothers considered artificial.

''[[Ever After High]]'' imagines Grimm Brothers (here descendants called Milton and Giles) as headmasters of Ever After High boarding school where they train the children of the previous generation of fairy tales to follow in their parents' footsteps. The ''[[The 10th Kingdom|10th Kingdom]]'' mini series states that the brothers were trapped in the fairy tale world for years where they witnessed the events of their stories before finally making it back to the real world. ''[[The Sisters Grimm]]'' book series follows their descendants, Sabrina and Daphne, as they adapt to life in Ferryport Landing, a town in upstate New York populated by fairy tale people. Separate from the previous series are ''[[The Land of Stories]]'' and ''its'' Sisters Grimm, a self described [[coven]] determined to track down and document creatures from the fairy tale world that cross over into the real world.

About two thirds of Bessarabia lies within modern-day [[Moldova]], with the Ukrainian [[Budjak]] region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] covering a small area in the north.\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)]], and the ensuing [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Peace of Bucharest]], the eastern parts of the [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]], an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[vassal state|vassal]], along with some areas formerly under direct Ottoman rule, were ceded to [[Imperial Russia]]. The acquisition was among the Empire's last territorial acquisitions in Europe. The newly acquired territories were organised as the [[Bessarabia Governorate|Governorate of Bessarabia]], adopting a name previously used for the southern plains, between the Dniester and the [[Danube]] rivers. Following the [[Crimean War]], in 1856, the southern areas of Bessarabia were returned to Moldavian rule; Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878, when [[United Principalities|Romania]], the result of Moldavia's union with [[Wallachia]], was pressured into exchanging those territories for the [[Dobruja]].\n\nIn 1917, in the wake of the [[Russian Revolution]], the area constituted itself as the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]], an autonomous republic part of a proposed [[Russian Democratic Federative Republic|federative Russian state]]. [[Bolshevik]] agitation in late 1917 and early 1918 resulted in the intervention of the [[Romanian Army]], ostensibly to pacify the region. Soon after, the parliamentary assembly declared independence, and then [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|union with the Kingdom of Romania]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Charles Upson |title=Bessarabia |url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/meta_pag.shtml |publisher=Dodd, Mead |location=New York City |year=1927}}</ref> The legality of these acts was however disputed, most prominently by the [[Soviet Union]], which regarded the area as a territory occupied by Romania.\n\nIn 1940, after securing the assent of Nazi Germany through the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], the Soviet Union pressured Romania, under threat of war,<ref name=\"Rothschild77\">Joseph Rothschild, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytc-muwFT_IC&pg=PA314 East Central Europe between the two World Wars]'' University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1977; {{ISBN|0-295953-57-8}}, p.314</ref> into withdrawing from Bessarabia, allowing the [[Red Army]] to [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|annex the region]]. The area was formally integrated into the Soviet Union: the core joined parts of the [[Moldavian ASSR]] to form the [[Moldavian SSR]], while territories inhabited by [[Slav]]ic majorities in the north and the south of Bessarabia were transferred to the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-aligned Romania recaptured the region in 1941 with the success of [[Operation M\u00fcnchen]] during the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]], but lost it in 1944 as the tide of war changed. In 1947, the Soviet-Romanian border along the Prut was internationally recognised by the Paris Treaty that ended [[World War II]].\n\nDuring the process of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the Moldavian and Ukrainian SSRs proclaimed their independence in 1991, becoming the modern states of [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]], while preserving the existing partition of Bessarabia. Following a short war in the early 1990s, the [[Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic]] was proclaimed in the [[Transnistria (geographical region)|Transnistria]], extending its authority also over the municipality of [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] on the right bank of Dniester river. Part of the [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]]-inhabited areas in the southern Bessarabia was organised in 1994 as an [[Gagauzia|autonomous region]] within Moldova.\n\n== Etymology and usage of the name ==\n[[File:Partitions of Moldavia.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Map of Bessarabia within Moldavia through time]]\n\nAccording to the traditional explanation, the name Bessarabia (''Basarabia'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) derives from the [[Wallachia]]n [[Basarab dynasty]], who allegedly ruled over the southern part of the area in the 14th century. Some scholars question this, however, claiming that:\n* the name was initially an [[exonym]] applied by [[Western Europe|Western]] cartographers\n* it was first used in local sources only in the late 17th century;\n* the idea that it referred to Moldavian regions near the [[Black Sea]] was explicitly rejected as a cartographic confusion by the early Moldavian chronicler [[Miron Costin]], and;\n* the confusion may have been caused by medieval Western cartographers, misinterpreting  contemporaneous Polish  references to Wallachia as ''Bessarabia'', as referring to a separate land between Wallachia and Moldavia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Coman| first=Marian|title=Basarabia \u2013 Inventarea cartografic\u0103 a unei regiuni|journal=Studii \u0219i Materiale de Istorie Medie| volume=XXIX| pages=183\u2013215|year=2011| publisher= [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]]| issn=1222-4766}}\n</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], the name Bessarabia originally applied only to the part of the territory south of the [[Upper Trajan Wall|Upper Trajanic Wall]], i.e. an area only slightly bigger than present-day [[Budjak]].\n\n== Geography ==\nThe region is bounded by the Dniester to the north and east, the [[Prut]] to the west, and the lower [[River Danube]] and [[Black Sea]] to the south.

It is very fertile and has [[lignite]] deposits and stone quarries. People living in the area grow [[sugar beet]], [[sunflower]], [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[tobacco]], [[wine grapes]], and [[fruit]]. They raise [[sheep]] and [[cattle]]. The main industry in the region is agricultural processing.\n\nThe main cities are [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] (former capital of Bessarabia Governorate, now capital of Moldova), and [[Izmail]] and [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovs'kyi]] (historically called Cetatea Alb\u0103 and Akkerman; both now within Ukraine). Other towns of administrative or historical importance include: [[Khotyn]], [[Reni, Ukraine|Reni]], and [[Kilia, Ukraine|Kilia]] (all now in Ukraine); and [[Lipcani]], [[Briceni]], [[Soroca]], [[B\u0103l\u021bi]], [[Orhei]], [[Ungheni]], [[Tighina|Bender/Tighina]], and [[Cahul]] (all now in Moldova).\n\n== History ==\n{{History of Romania}}\n{{See also|History of Moldova|History of Moldavia}}\n\nIn the late 14th century, the newly established [[Principality of Moldavia]] encompassed what later became known as Bessarabia. Afterwards, this territory was directly or indirectly, partly or wholly controlled by: the [[Ottoman Empire]] (as suzerain of Moldavia, with direct rule only in Budjak and [[Khotin]]), [[Russian Empire]], [[Romania]], the [[USSR]]. Since 1991, most of the territory forms the core of [[Moldova]], with smaller parts in [[Ukraine]].\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Main article|Prehistory of Moldavia|Bronze Age in Romania}}\n\nThe territory of Bessarabia has been inhabited by people for thousands of years. [[Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture]] flourished between the 6th and 3rd millennium BC.\n\n=== Ancient times ===\n{{See also|Dacians|Dacia|Free Dacians}}\n\nIn [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]] the region was inhabited by [[Thracians]], as well as for shorter periods by [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Sarmatians]], and [[Celts]], specifically by tribes such as the [[Costoboci]], [[Carpi (Dacian tribe)|Carpi]], [[Britogali]], [[Tyragetae]], and [[Bastarnae]].<ref>{{in lang|ro}}Hotia C. Matei, \"Enciplopedia de istorie\" (\"History encyclopedia\"), Meronia, Bucharest, 2006, {{ISBN|978-973-7839-03-9}}, pag. 290</ref> In the 6th century BC, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] settlers established the colony of [[Tyras]] along the [[Black Sea]] coast and traded with the locals. [[Celts]] also settled in the southern parts of Bessarabia, their main city being Aliobrix.\n\nThe first polity that is believed to have included the whole of Bessarabia was the [[Dacia]]n polity of [[Burebista]] in the 1st century BC. After his death, the polity was divided into smaller pieces, and the central parts were unified in the Dacian kingdom of [[Decebalus]] in the 1st century AD. This kingdom was defeated by the [[Roman Empire]] in 106. Southern Bessarabia was included in the empire even before that, in 57 AD, as part of the Roman province [[Moesia Inferior]], but it was secured only when the Dacian Kingdom was defeated in 106. The Romans built defensive earthen walls in Southern Bessarabia (e.g. [[Lower Trajan Wall]]) to defend the [[Scythia Minor]] province against invasions. Except for the [[Black Sea]] shore in the south, Bessarabia remained outside direct Roman control; the myriad of tribes there are called by modern historians [[Free Dacians]].<ref>Mihai B\u0103rbulescu, Dennis Diletant, Keith Hitchins, \u0218erban Papacostea, Pompiliu Teodor, \"Istoria Rom\u00e2niei\", Corint, Bucharest, 2007, {{ISBN|978-973-135-031-8}}, pag. 77</ref> The 2nd to the 5th centuries also saw the development of the [[Chernyakhov culture]].\n\nIn 270, the Roman authorities began to withdraw their forces south of the Danube, especially from the [[Roman Dacia]], due to the invading [[Goths]] and Carpi. The [[Goths]], a Germanic tribe, poured into the [[Roman Empire]] from the lower [[Dniepr River]], through the southern part of Bessarabia ([[Budjak|Budjak steppe]]), which due to its geographic position and characteristics (mainly [[steppe]]), was swept by various nomadic tribes for many centuries. In 378, the area was overrun by the [[Huns]].\n\n=== Early Middle Ages ===\n{{Main article|Moldavia in the Middle Ages|Romania in the Early Middle Ages|Origin of the Romanians}}\n\n[[File:Tara Rumaneasca map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|According to one theory, the region's name originated from the Wallachian rule during the late 14th century (1390 map).]]\n\nFrom the 3rd century until the 11th century, the region was invaded numerous times in turn by different tribes: [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], [[Magyars]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] and [[Mongols]]. The territory of Bessarabia was encompassed in dozens of ephemeral kingdoms which were disbanded when another wave of migrants arrived. Those centuries were characterized by a terrible state of insecurity and mass movement of these tribes. The period was later known as the ''\"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\"'' of Europe, or Age of migrations.\n\nIn 561, the Avars captured Bessarabia and executed the local ruler [[Mesamer]]. Following the Avars, Slavs started to arrive in the region and establish settlements.

Based on the name of the region, some authors consider that in the latter part of the 14th century the southern part of the region was under the rule of [[Wallachia]] (the ruling dynasty of Wallachia during that period was called [[House of Basarab|Basarab]]). In the 15th century, the entire region was a part of the principality of Moldavia. [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] ruled between 1457 and 1504, a period of nearly 50 years during which he won 32 battles defending his country against virtually all his neighbours (mainly the Ottomans and the Tatars, but also the Hungarians and the Poles), while losing only two. During this period, after each victory, he raised a monastery or a church close to the battlefield honoring Christianity.

Wine making was particularly affected by the external policy of the Romanian state: the [[most favoured nation]] status awarded to France brought inexpensive French wine to the market, while exports to the traditional markets in [[Poland]] were hindered by the trade war started in 1926.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|50}}{{r|Taranov|p=52\u201356}} \n\nAccording to Alla Skvortsova, the peasant situation was further aggravated by the [[Great Depression]], with prices for agricultural products dropping catastrophically and not recovering until the end of the decade.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|49}} While only 2.8% of the national agricultural credit was directed by the [[National Bank of Romania]] towards Bessarabia in 1936, by 1940 70% of the peasants were in debt to the large landowners and moneylenders. In order to pay debts, many of the poorer peasants had to sell their livestock an even their land. Failure to pay the redemption payments for 2.5 years also resulted in the land reverting to state property; thus, by 1938, in the district of [[Soroca]] only a quarter of the peasant households had retained their allotment.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|48-49}} By 1939 farms of up to 5 hectares throughout the region had lost a seventh of their land, while farms with more than 10 hectares had increased their land by 26%. According to a study of the new Soviet administration, in June 1940 7.3% of the peasant households in the Bessarabian regions of the Moldavian SSR were completely landless, 38.15% had up to 3 hectares (an average of 1.7 hectares per lot) and 22.4% had 3 to 5 hectares (an average of 2.6 hectares per one household), i.e. more than two-thirds of the peasant households were farm laborers and poor peasants. Better off was the middle peasantry, which owned 5 to 10 hectares, and constituted 22.73% of peasant farms. The rest, constituting 9.4% of the farms, owned more than 10 hectares each, but held under their control 36% of peasant land, i.e. more than all small farms taken together. The 818 large landowners held an average of 100 hectares each, while institutional owners (the state, churches and monasteries) held another 59 thousand hectares. About 54% of peasant households had no livestock, about two thirds had no horse, a little more than a sixth had one horse each, and only 13.2% had two or more working horses. In the whole of Bessarabian region of the Moldavian SSR there were at the beginning of Soviet administration only 219 obsolete tractors, mostly owned by larger farms and used primarily as threshing engines. With little serviceable equestrian equipment, tillage, sowing and harvesting of all crops were mostly carried out manually. Throughout the interwar era, Bessarabia witnessed several negative phenomena: further social stratification in the countryside, deepening poverty, lowering yields, worsening the structure of crops grown, reducing the total agricultural production.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|49}}<ref name=\"vanMeurs\"/>{{rp|96}} The number of cattle fell by 26% between 1926 and 1938, the number of sheep by 5%, the number of pigs by 14%. Average grain yield also decreased from 1920/1925 to 1935/1939 from 850 kg per hectare to 800 kg. The area used in wine-making grew by 15,000 hectares between 1930 and 1938, however wine quality dropped, as slightly over 80% of the vineyards were planted with lower quality grape varieties.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|50}} According to V.I.

As a consequence, even Bessarabian entrepreneurs preferred to invest their capital in those areas instead of using it within the region. Local industry faced fierce competition from larger Romanian companies, which had access to preferential rail tariffs, limited credit to local entrepreneurs and flooded the local market with cheaper industrial goods produced in Romania or imported from abroad.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|52}} Nevertheless, some new small-scale industrial enterprises were established in the 1920s, using primarily local raw materials and producing for the local market. The total engine power rose from 7.8 thousand [[Horsepower|hp]] in 1925 to 12.2 thousand in 1929. Although the number of industrial enterprises more than doubled after 1918, small semi-handicraft production prevailed, seldomly using hired labor: in 1930 there were an average of only 2.4 employees per enterprise.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|50}} During the 22 years of Romanian rule, only one large enterprise was built in Bessarabia: the [[B\u0103l\u021bi]] sugar plant.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|51}}{{r|Taranov|p=35\u201342}}\n\nAccording to Alla Skvortsova, not all new enterprises survived for long, and the Great Depression had a particularly strong impact on the region, many of the companies going bankrupt or closing in 1929-1933. Governmental policy, influenced by the banking system and the industrial cartels, prevented a rebound, the industry of the ''Old Kingdom'' again receiving preferential treatment. The main factors that affected the development of Bessarabia in the 1930s were severe credit restrictions, increases in transport tariffs and customs restrictions and special tax policies. Tax burden was notably high, with enterprises required to fully provide the assigned tax agent with housing, heating, lighting and office space.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|53}} Bessarabia was reduced mostly to a supplier of raw materials and a market for industrial goods of Romanian or foreign origin. By the end of the 1930s, the only industrial sectors that managed to rebound were the food and woodworking industries, the rest witnessing either stagnation or a decrease compared to pre-depression levels. However, most industrial facilities in the food industry worked significantly below their installed capacity even in prosperous years such as 1937. Several large factories, such as the [[Basarabeasca]], [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Cetatea Alb\u0103]], [[Flore\u0219ti, Moldova|Flore\u0219ti]] and [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]], railway workshops, the Cetatea Alb\u0103 and Chi\u0219in\u0103u textile and knitwear factories and the Cetatea Alb\u0103 canning factory and distillery were dismantled and relocated to the ''Old Kingdom'' by 1938.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|50-51}} Between 1929 and 1937, fixed capital in the industry dropped by 10%, and the number of industrial workers in Bessarabia dropped from 5,400 in 1925 to 3,500 in 1937, while their overall number in Romania had increased by almost 27% during the same period.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|55-56}} Between 1926 and 1937 the share of the food industry in the total production of large manufacturing industries increased from 77.1% to 92.4%, with sharp decreases observed in sectors with higher added value, such as the metalworking, textile and leather processing industries. Even so, the food industry failed to fulfill local needs, while most industries heavily relied on manual labor and primitive technologies. Electricity production in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Bessarabia's center and Romania's second largest city, recorded in 1925 at 4.47 million kWh, only increased by 6.7% during the following decade, lagging far behind other Romanian cities: 572.3% in [[Gala\u021bi]], 238.2% in Bucharest, and over 101% in Ia\u0219i.{{r|Taranov|p=35\u201342}} By the end of the 1930, only one in seven Bessarabians had access to electricity, compared to one in four  among general Romanian population.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|54}}<ref name=\"CKing\"/>{{rp|41}}\n\nThe Romanian administration carried out a large number of projects aimed at improving the infrastructure of the province, in order to introduce European gauge and reorient it towards Romania.<ref name=\"CKing\"/>{{rp|41}}<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|53-54}} The total length of the railway lines in Bessarabia increased only by 78 km (from 1140 in 1918 to 1218 in 1940). Local businessmen remained dissatisfied with the pace of the construction of new railways (the Chi\u0219in\u0103u-[[C\u0103inari]] was the only one built anew) and the closure of a number of lines. Road infrastructure was also improved, as new highways and bridges over the Prut were built, while part of the existing roads were repaired and paved, increasing the length of highways from 150 to 754 km.<ref name=\"CKing\"/>{{rp|41}}<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|53-54}}  However, most other roads remained impassable during rainy periods. Shipping on the Dniester was closed, and was never established on the Prut. In the 1930s, new airports were built, telephone lines were laid out, and radio transmitters were installed; nevertheless, the region still lagged behind [[Transylvania]] and the ''Old Kingdom''.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|53-54}} \n\nAccording to Alla Skvortsova, overall, the share of Bessarabian enterprises in the Romanian industry fell between 1919 and 1937 from 9% to 5.7%, while the number of enterprises employing at least 20 employees dropping from 262 to 196.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|51}} The share of investments in Bessarabian industry also fell from 0.3% in 1923 to 0.1% in 1936.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|52}} Sociologist [[T.

Bessarabia was divided between the Moldavian SSR (65% of the territory and 80% of the population) and the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Bessarabia's northern and southern districts (now [[Budjak]] and parts of the [[Chernivtsi oblast]]) were allotted to Ukraine, while some territories (4,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) on the left (eastern) bank of Dniester (present [[Transnistria]]), previously part of Ukraine, were allotted to Moldavia. Following the Soviet takeover, many Bessarabians, who were accused of supporting the deposed Romanian administration, were executed or deported to [[Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstan]].\n\nBetween September and November 1940, the [[Bessarabia Germans|ethnic Germans of Bessarabia]] were offered resettlement to Germany, following a German-Soviet agreement. Fearing Soviet oppression, almost all Germans (93,000) agreed. Most of them were resettled to the newly annexed Polish territories.\n\nOn June 22, 1941 the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] invasion of the Soviet Union commenced with [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Between June 22 and July 26, 1941, Romanian troops with the help of [[Wehrmacht]] recovered Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. The Soviets employed [[scorched earth]] tactics during their forced retreat from Bessarabia, destroying the infrastructure and transporting movable goods to Russia by railway. At the end of July, after a year of Soviet rule, the region was once again under Romanian control.\n\nAs the military operation was still in progress, there were cases of Romanian troops \"taking revenge\" on Jews in Bessarabia, in the form of [[pogrom]]s on civilians and murder of Jewish [[Prisoner of war|POWs]], resulting in several thousand dead. The supposed cause for murdering Jews was that in 1940 some Jews welcomed the Soviet takeover as liberation. At the same time the notorious [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe D]], operating in the area of the [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 11th Army]], committed summary executions of Jews under the pretext that they were spies, [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Communism|Communists]], or under no pretext whatsoever.\n\nThe political solution of the \"[[Jewish Question]]\" was apparently seen by the Romanian [[dictator]] Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]] more in expulsion rather than extermination. That portion of the Jewish population of Bessarabia and Bukovina which did not flee before the retreat of the Soviet troops (147,000) was initially gathered into [[ghettos]] or [[Nazi concentration camps]], and then deported during 1941\u20131942 in [[death march]]es into [[Transnistria (World War II)|Romanian-occupied Transnistria]], where the \"[[Final Solution]]\" was applied.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/499496/Constructing_Interethnic_Conflict_and_Cooperation_Why_Some_People_Harmed_Jews_and_Others_Helped_Them_during_the_Holocaust_in_Romania|title=Constructing Interethnic Conflict and Cooperation: Why Some People Harmed Jews and Others Helped Them during the Holocaust in Romania Diana Dumitru|journal=World Politics |date=January 2011 |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201342 |accessdate=2014-10-19 |doi=10.1017/s0043887110000274}}</ref>\n\nAfter three years of relative peace, the German-Soviet front returned in 1944 to the land border on the [[Dniester]].

About two thirds of Bessarabia lies within modern-day [[Moldova]], with the Ukrainian [[Budjak]] region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] covering a small area in the north.\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)]], and the ensuing [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Peace of Bucharest]], the eastern parts of the [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]], an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[vassal state|vassal]], along with some areas formerly under direct Ottoman rule, were ceded to [[Imperial Russia]]. The acquisition was among the Empire's last territorial acquisitions in Europe. The newly acquired territories were organised as the [[Bessarabia Governorate|Governorate of Bessarabia]], adopting a name previously used for the southern plains, between the Dniester and the [[Danube]] rivers. Following the [[Crimean War]], in 1856, the southern areas of Bessarabia were returned to Moldavian rule; Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878, when [[United Principalities|Romania]], the result of Moldavia's union with [[Wallachia]], was pressured into exchanging those territories for the [[Dobruja]].\n\nIn 1917, in the wake of the [[Russian Revolution]], the area constituted itself as the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]], an autonomous republic part of a proposed [[Russian Democratic Federative Republic|federative Russian state]]. [[Bolshevik]] agitation in late 1917 and early 1918 resulted in the intervention of the [[Romanian Army]], ostensibly to pacify the region. Soon after, the parliamentary assembly declared independence, and then [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|union with the Kingdom of Romania]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Charles Upson |title=Bessarabia |url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/meta_pag.shtml |publisher=Dodd, Mead |location=New York City |year=1927}}</ref> The legality of these acts was however disputed, most prominently by the [[Soviet Union]], which regarded the area as a territory occupied by Romania.\n\nIn 1940, after securing the assent of Nazi Germany through the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], the Soviet Union pressured Romania, under threat of war,<ref name=\"Rothschild77\">Joseph Rothschild, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytc-muwFT_IC&pg=PA314 East Central Europe between the two World Wars]'' University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1977; {{ISBN|0-295953-57-8}}, p.314</ref> into withdrawing from Bessarabia, allowing the [[Red Army]] to [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|annex the region]]. The area was formally integrated into the Soviet Union: the core joined parts of the [[Moldavian ASSR]] to form the [[Moldavian SSR]], while territories inhabited by [[Slav]]ic majorities in the north and the south of Bessarabia were transferred to the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-aligned Romania recaptured the region in 1941 with the success of [[Operation M\u00fcnchen]] during the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]], but lost it in 1944 as the tide of war changed. In 1947, the Soviet-Romanian border along the Prut was internationally recognised by the Paris Treaty that ended [[World War II]].\n\nDuring the process of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the Moldavian and Ukrainian SSRs proclaimed their independence in 1991, becoming the modern states of [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]], while preserving the existing partition of Bessarabia. Following a short war in the early 1990s, the [[Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic]] was proclaimed in the [[Transnistria (geographical region)|Transnistria]], extending its authority also over the municipality of [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] on the right bank of Dniester river. Part of the [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]]-inhabited areas in the southern Bessarabia was organised in 1994 as an [[Gagauzia|autonomous region]] within Moldova.\n\n== Etymology and usage of the name ==\n[[File:Partitions of Moldavia.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Map of Bessarabia within Moldavia through time]]\n\nAccording to the traditional explanation, the name Bessarabia (''Basarabia'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) derives from the [[Wallachia]]n [[Basarab dynasty]], who allegedly ruled over the southern part of the area in the 14th century. Some scholars question this, however, claiming that:\n* the name was initially an [[exonym]] applied by [[Western Europe|Western]] cartographers\n* it was first used in local sources only in the late 17th century;\n* the idea that it referred to Moldavian regions near the [[Black Sea]] was explicitly rejected as a cartographic confusion by the early Moldavian chronicler [[Miron Costin]], and;\n* the confusion may have been caused by medieval Western cartographers, misinterpreting  contemporaneous Polish  references to Wallachia as ''Bessarabia'', as referring to a separate land between Wallachia and Moldavia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Coman| first=Marian|title=Basarabia \u2013 Inventarea cartografic\u0103 a unei regiuni|journal=Studii \u0219i Materiale de Istorie Medie| volume=XXIX| pages=183\u2013215|year=2011| publisher= [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]]| issn=1222-4766}}\n</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], the name Bessarabia originally applied only to the part of the territory south of the [[Upper Trajan Wall|Upper Trajanic Wall]], i.e. an area only slightly bigger than present-day [[Budjak]].\n\n== Geography ==\nThe region is bounded by the Dniester to the north and east, the [[Prut]] to the west, and the lower [[River Danube]] and [[Black Sea]] to the south.

It is very fertile and has [[lignite]] deposits and stone quarries. People living in the area grow [[sugar beet]], [[sunflower]], [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[tobacco]], [[wine grapes]], and [[fruit]]. They raise [[sheep]] and [[cattle]]. The main industry in the region is agricultural processing.\n\nThe main cities are [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] (former capital of Bessarabia Governorate, now capital of Moldova), and [[Izmail]] and [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovs'kyi]] (historically called Cetatea Alb\u0103 and Akkerman; both now within Ukraine). Other towns of administrative or historical importance include: [[Khotyn]], [[Reni, Ukraine|Reni]], and [[Kilia, Ukraine|Kilia]] (all now in Ukraine); and [[Lipcani]], [[Briceni]], [[Soroca]], [[B\u0103l\u021bi]], [[Orhei]], [[Ungheni]], [[Tighina|Bender/Tighina]], and [[Cahul]] (all now in Moldova).\n\n== History ==\n{{History of Romania}}\n{{See also|History of Moldova|History of Moldavia}}\n\nIn the late 14th century, the newly established [[Principality of Moldavia]] encompassed what later became known as Bessarabia. Afterwards, this territory was directly or indirectly, partly or wholly controlled by: the [[Ottoman Empire]] (as suzerain of Moldavia, with direct rule only in Budjak and [[Khotin]]), [[Russian Empire]], [[Romania]], the [[USSR]]. Since 1991, most of the territory forms the core of [[Moldova]], with smaller parts in [[Ukraine]].\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Main article|Prehistory of Moldavia|Bronze Age in Romania}}\n\nThe territory of Bessarabia has been inhabited by people for thousands of years.

[[Celts]] also settled in the southern parts of Bessarabia, their main city being Aliobrix.\n\nThe first polity that is believed to have included the whole of Bessarabia was the [[Dacia]]n polity of [[Burebista]] in the 1st century BC. After his death, the polity was divided into smaller pieces, and the central parts were unified in the Dacian kingdom of [[Decebalus]] in the 1st century AD. This kingdom was defeated by the [[Roman Empire]] in 106. Southern Bessarabia was included in the empire even before that, in 57 AD, as part of the Roman province [[Moesia Inferior]], but it was secured only when the Dacian Kingdom was defeated in 106. The Romans built defensive earthen walls in Southern Bessarabia (e.g. [[Lower Trajan Wall]]) to defend the [[Scythia Minor]] province against invasions. Except for the [[Black Sea]] shore in the south, Bessarabia remained outside direct Roman control; the myriad of tribes there are called by modern historians [[Free Dacians]].<ref>Mihai B\u0103rbulescu, Dennis Diletant, Keith Hitchins, \u0218erban Papacostea, Pompiliu Teodor, \"Istoria Rom\u00e2niei\", Corint, Bucharest, 2007, {{ISBN|978-973-135-031-8}}, pag. 77</ref> The 2nd to the 5th centuries also saw the development of the [[Chernyakhov culture]].\n\nIn 270, the Roman authorities began to withdraw their forces south of the Danube, especially from the [[Roman Dacia]], due to the invading [[Goths]] and Carpi. The [[Goths]], a Germanic tribe, poured into the [[Roman Empire]] from the lower [[Dniepr River]], through the southern part of Bessarabia ([[Budjak|Budjak steppe]]), which due to its geographic position and characteristics (mainly [[steppe]]), was swept by various nomadic tribes for many centuries. In 378, the area was overrun by the [[Huns]].\n\n=== Early Middle Ages ===\n{{Main article|Moldavia in the Middle Ages|Romania in the Early Middle Ages|Origin of the Romanians}}\n\n[[File:Tara Rumaneasca map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|According to one theory, the region's name originated from the Wallachian rule during the late 14th century (1390 map).]]\n\nFrom the 3rd century until the 11th century, the region was invaded numerous times in turn by different tribes: [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], [[Magyars]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] and [[Mongols]]. The territory of Bessarabia was encompassed in dozens of ephemeral kingdoms which were disbanded when another wave of migrants arrived. Those centuries were characterized by a terrible state of insecurity and mass movement of these tribes. The period was later known as the ''\"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\"'' of Europe, or Age of migrations.\n\nIn 561, the Avars captured Bessarabia and executed the local ruler [[Mesamer]]. Following the Avars, Slavs started to arrive in the region and establish settlements. Then, in 582, [[Onogurs|Onogur]] Bulgars settled in southeastern Bessarabia and northern [[Dobruja]], from which they moved to Moesia Inferior (allegedly under pressure from the [[Khazars]]), and formed the nascent region of ''Bulgaria''. With the rise of the Khazars' state in the east, the invasions began to diminish and it was possible to create larger states. According to some opinions, the southern part of Bessarabia remained under the influence of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] until to the end of the 9th century.\n\nBetween the 8th and 10th centuries, the southern part of Bessarabia was inhabited by people from the [[Balkan-Danubian culture]]<ref>\u0427\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u0413.\u0424. \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b \u043a \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 VIII-\u0425 \u0432\u0432. \u044e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u041f\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e-\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0447\u044c\u044f//\u0414\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u041c\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0438, \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0432, 1969, \u0441. 224\u2013230</ref> (the culture of the First Bulgarian Empire). Between the 9th and 13th centuries, Bessarabia is mentioned in Slav chronicles as part of ''Bolohoveni'' (north) and ''[[Brodnici]]'' (south) voivodeships, believed{{by whom|date=February 2012}} to be [[Vlach]] principalities of the early Middle Ages.\n\nThe last large scale invasions were those of the [[Mongols]] of 1241, 1290, and 1343. Sehr al-Jedid (near [[Orhei]]), an important settlement of the [[Golden Horde]], dates from this period. They led to a retreat of a big part of the population to the mountainous areas in [[Eastern Carpathians]] and to [[Transylvania]]. The population east of Prut became especially low at the time of the Tatar invasions.\n\nIn the Late Middle Age, chronicles mention a [[Tigheci]] \"republic\", predating the establishment of the [[Principality of Moldavia]], situated near the modern town of [[Cahul]] in the southwest of Bessarabia, preserving its autonomy even during the later Principality even into the 18th century. [[Republic of Genoa|Genovese]] merchants rebuilt or established a number of forts along Dniester (notably [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Moncastro]]) and Danube (including [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Kyliya/Chilia]]-[[Chilia Veche|Licostomo]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n=== Principality of Moldavia ===\n{{Main article|History of Moldavia}}\n[[File:Rom1793-1812.png|thumb|Most of Bessarabia was for centuries part of the principality of Moldavia (1800 map).]]\n\nAfter the 1360s the region was gradually included in the [[principality]] of [[Moldavia]], which by 1392 established control over the fortresses of [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Akkerman]] and [[Kilia, Ukraine|Chilia]], its eastern border becoming the [[Dniester|River Dniester]]. Based on the name of the region, some authors consider that in the latter part of the 14th century the southern part of the region was under the rule of [[Wallachia]] (the ruling dynasty of Wallachia during that period was called [[House of Basarab|Basarab]]). In the 15th century, the entire region was a part of the principality of Moldavia. [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] ruled between 1457 and 1504, a period of nearly 50 years during which he won 32 battles defending his country against virtually all his neighbours (mainly the Ottomans and the Tatars, but also the Hungarians and the Poles), while losing only two. During this period, after each victory, he raised a monastery or a church close to the battlefield honoring Christianity. Many of these battlefields and churches, as well as old fortresses, are situated in Bessarabia (mainly along Dniester).\n\n[[File:\u0410\u043a\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0446\u044f \u0432 \u0411\u0456\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434-\u0414\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044311.jpg|thumb|Akkerman fortress in [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]], [[Ukraine]]) was one of the many important castles in Bessarabia.]]\n\nIn 1484, the Turks invaded and captured Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103 (Akkerman in Turkish), and annexed the shoreline southern part of Bessarabia, which was then divided into two [[sanjak]]s (districts) of the Ottoman Empire.

Better off was the middle peasantry, which owned 5 to 10 hectares, and constituted 22.73% of peasant farms. The rest, constituting 9.4% of the farms, owned more than 10 hectares each, but held under their control 36% of peasant land, i.e. more than all small farms taken together.

Although the number of industrial enterprises more than doubled after 1918, small semi-handicraft production prevailed, seldomly using hired labor: in 1930 there were an average of only 2.4 employees per enterprise.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|50}} During the 22 years of Romanian rule, only one large enterprise was built in Bessarabia: the [[B\u0103l\u021bi]] sugar plant.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|51}}{{r|Taranov|p=35\u201342}}\n\nAccording to Alla Skvortsova, not all new enterprises survived for long, and the Great Depression had a particularly strong impact on the region, many of the companies going bankrupt or closing in 1929-1933. Governmental policy, influenced by the banking system and the industrial cartels, prevented a rebound, the industry of the ''Old Kingdom'' again receiving preferential treatment. The main factors that affected the development of Bessarabia in the 1930s were severe credit restrictions, increases in transport tariffs and customs restrictions and special tax policies. Tax burden was notably high, with enterprises required to fully provide the assigned tax agent with housing, heating, lighting and office space.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|53}} Bessarabia was reduced mostly to a supplier of raw materials and a market for industrial goods of Romanian or foreign origin. By the end of the 1930s, the only industrial sectors that managed to rebound were the food and woodworking industries, the rest witnessing either stagnation or a decrease compared to pre-depression levels. However, most industrial facilities in the food industry worked significantly below their installed capacity even in prosperous years such as 1937. Several large factories, such as the [[Basarabeasca]], [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Cetatea Alb\u0103]], [[Flore\u0219ti, Moldova|Flore\u0219ti]] and [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]], railway workshops, the Cetatea Alb\u0103 and Chi\u0219in\u0103u textile and knitwear factories and the Cetatea Alb\u0103 canning factory and distillery were dismantled and relocated to the ''Old Kingdom'' by 1938.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|50-51}} Between 1929 and 1937, fixed capital in the industry dropped by 10%, and the number of industrial workers in Bessarabia dropped from 5,400 in 1925 to 3,500 in 1937, while their overall number in Romania had increased by almost 27% during the same period.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|55-56}} Between 1926 and 1937 the share of the food industry in the total production of large manufacturing industries increased from 77.1% to 92.4%, with sharp decreases observed in sectors with higher added value, such as the metalworking, textile and leather processing industries. Even so, the food industry failed to fulfill local needs, while most industries heavily relied on manual labor and primitive technologies. Electricity production in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Bessarabia's center and Romania's second largest city, recorded in 1925 at 4.47 million kWh, only increased by 6.7% during the following decade, lagging far behind other Romanian cities: 572.3% in [[Gala\u021bi]], 238.2% in Bucharest, and over 101% in Ia\u0219i.{{r|Taranov|p=35\u201342}} By the end of the 1930, only one in seven Bessarabians had access to electricity, compared to one in four  among general Romanian population.<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|54}}<ref name=\"CKing\"/>{{rp|41}} In the same period, Bessarabia had among the highest incidences of several major infectious diseases, as well as some of the highest mortality rates from these diseases.<ref name=\"CKing\"/>{{rp|41}} \n\nThe Romanian administration carried out a large number of projects aimed at improving the infrastructure of the province, in order to introduce European gauge and reorient it towards Romania.<ref name=\"CKing\"/>{{rp|41}}<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|53-54}} The total length of the railway lines in Bessarabia increased only by 78 km (from 1140 in 1918 to 1218 in 1940). Local businessmen remained dissatisfied with the pace of the construction of new railways (the Chi\u0219in\u0103u-[[C\u0103inari]] was the only one built anew) and the closure of a number of lines. Road infrastructure was also improved, as new highways and bridges over the Prut were built, while part of the existing roads were repaired and paved, increasing the length of highways from 150 to 754 km.<ref name=\"CKing\"/>{{rp|41}}<ref name=\"Skvortsova\"/>{{rp|53-54}}  However, most other roads remained impassable during rainy periods. Shipping on the Dniester was closed, and was never established on the Prut.

Bessarabia was divided between the Moldavian SSR (65% of the territory and 80% of the population) and the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Bessarabia's northern and southern districts (now [[Budjak]] and parts of the [[Chernivtsi oblast]]) were allotted to Ukraine, while some territories (4,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) on the left (eastern) bank of Dniester (present [[Transnistria]]), previously part of Ukraine, were allotted to Moldavia. Following the Soviet takeover, many Bessarabians, who were accused of supporting the deposed Romanian administration, were executed or deported to [[Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstan]].\n\nBetween September and November 1940, the [[Bessarabia Germans|ethnic Germans of Bessarabia]] were offered resettlement to Germany, following a German-Soviet agreement. Fearing Soviet oppression, almost all Germans (93,000) agreed. Most of them were resettled to the newly annexed Polish territories.\n\nOn June 22, 1941 the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] invasion of the Soviet Union commenced with [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Between June 22 and July 26, 1941, Romanian troops with the help of [[Wehrmacht]] recovered Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. The Soviets employed [[scorched earth]] tactics during their forced retreat from Bessarabia, destroying the infrastructure and transporting movable goods to Russia by railway. At the end of July, after a year of Soviet rule, the region was once again under Romanian control.\n\nAs the military operation was still in progress, there were cases of Romanian troops \"taking revenge\" on Jews in Bessarabia, in the form of [[pogrom]]s on civilians and murder of Jewish [[Prisoner of war|POWs]], resulting in several thousand dead. The supposed cause for murdering Jews was that in 1940 some Jews welcomed the Soviet takeover as liberation. At the same time the notorious [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe D]], operating in the area of the [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 11th Army]], committed summary executions of Jews under the pretext that they were spies, [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Communism|Communists]], or under no pretext whatsoever.\n\nThe political solution of the \"[[Jewish Question]]\" was apparently seen by the Romanian [[dictator]] Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]] more in expulsion rather than extermination. That portion of the Jewish population of Bessarabia and Bukovina which did not flee before the retreat of the Soviet troops (147,000) was initially gathered into [[ghettos]] or [[Nazi concentration camps]], and then deported during 1941\u20131942 in [[death march]]es into [[Transnistria (World War II)|Romanian-occupied Transnistria]], where the \"[[Final Solution]]\" was applied.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/499496/Constructing_Interethnic_Conflict_and_Cooperation_Why_Some_People_Harmed_Jews_and_Others_Helped_Them_during_the_Holocaust_in_Romania|title=Constructing Interethnic Conflict and Cooperation: Why Some People Harmed Jews and Others Helped Them during the Holocaust in Romania Diana Dumitru|journal=World Politics |date=January 2011 |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201342 |accessdate=2014-10-19 |doi=10.1017/s0043887110000274}}</ref>\n\nAfter three years of relative peace, the German-Soviet front returned in 1944 to the land border on the [[Dniester]].

The Soviet armies overran Bessarabia in a two-pronged offensive within five days. In pocket battles at [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] and [[Sarata, Odessa|S\u0103rata]] the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 6th Army]] of c. 650,000 men, newly reformed after the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], was obliterated.

This appears to be a fairly accurate guess; the official Russian figures, which the Moldavians considered as inaccurate and padded, set the Moldavian proportion considerably lower, as about one-half. Such figures are misleading in all European countries of mixed nationalities, since the census enumerator generally has instructions to count everyone who understands the state language as being of that nationality, no matter what his everyday speech may be.\"</ref>\n\nAccording to N.

However, the estimates of the total population rise to approximately 3.2 million.\n\nIn the 1979 Soviet census for the [[Moldavian SSR]] (including Transnistria; northern and southern Bessarabia - nowadays both part of Ukraine - were not included): 63.9% identified themselves as [[Moldovans]] and 0.04% as Romanians. For the Soviet census of 1989 (conducted in the Moldavian SSR): 64.5% declared themselves as Moldovans and 0.06% Romanians. In the [[Moldova]]n census of 2014 (not including Transnistria): 75% declared themselves Moldovans and 7% Romanians.\n\n==Economy==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2020}}\n* 1911: There were 165 loan societies, 117 savings banks, forty three professional savings and loan societies, and eight [[Zemstvo]] loan offices; all these had total assets of about 10,000,000 rubles. There were also eighty nine government savings banks, with deposits of about 9,000,000 rubles.\n* 1918: There was only {{convert|657|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} of railway; the main lines converged on Russia and were broad gauge. Rolling stock and right of way were in bad shape. There were about 400 locomotives, with only about one hundred fit for use. There were 290 passenger coaches and thirty three more out for repair. Finally, out of 4530 freight cars and 187 tank cars, only 1389 and 103 were usable. The Romanians reduced the gauge to a standard {{convert|56.5|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}, so that cars could be run to the rest of Europe. Also, there were only a few inefficient boat bridges. Romanian highway engineers decided to build ten bridges: [[Cuzl\u0103u]], [[\u021au\u021bora]], [[Lipcani]], [[\u0218erpeni\u021ba]], [[\u0218tef\u0103ne\u0219ti, Boto\u0219ani|\u0218tef\u0103ne\u0219ti]]\u2013[[Br\u0103ni\u0219te]], [[Cahul]]-[[Oancea]], [[B\u0103d\u0103r\u0103i]]-[[V\u0103leni, Vaslui|Moara Domneasc\u0103]], [[Sarata, Odessa|S\u0103rata]], [[Bumbala]]-[[Leova]], [[Badragi]] and [[F\u0103lciu]] (F\u0103lciu is a locality in Romania.
