It was established as the University of Moratuwa (UoM), Sri Lanka on 22 December 1978 under the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 and operates under the general direction of the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]]. Its origin can be traced to the [[Maradana College of Technology|Government Technical College]] (GTC) which was established in Maradana, Colombo in 1893.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.cebeu.lk/cebeuw/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/UoM.pdf|title=The Birth of a University - 50th Anniversary Publication|last=|first=|publisher=The Association of Pioneer Engineers of University of Moratuwa|year=2016|isbn=|location=Sri Lanka|pages=56\u201361}}</ref>\n\nThe GTC was one of the first institutions for formal technical education in Sri Lanka (the [[Ceylon Medical School]] was established in 1870, followed by [[Colombo Law College]] (1875), School of Agriculture (1884) and the [[Government Technical College]] (1893)). It became the pioneering institution for science education in Sri Lanka and its name was changed to the [[Ceylon Technical College]] (CTC) in 1906. The CTC provided technical education in civil, [[Electrical Engineering|electrical]] and [[mechanical engineering]] fields even before the establishment of the [[University College Colombo]], affiliated to the [[University of London]], in 1921.\n\nThe CTC at Katubedda first earned University status, as the Katubedda Campus of the single [[University of Ceylon]], on 15 February 1972. The Department of Architecture, then at Colombo, was transferred to Katubedda in the formation of this new campus. The Katubedda Campus thus began with one faculty, that of Engineering and Architecture. The first president was Dr. [[LH Sumanadasa]] who steered the progress of the institution and was the principal of the IPT before it became the Katubedda Campus. When Ceylon became a Republic on 22 May 1972, the corporate name of the university was changed to the [[University of Sri Lanka]].\n\nIn 1978 it gained the Independent University Status under Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.<ref name=history>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.uom.lk/history|publisher=University of Moratuwa|accessdate=11 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Organisation and administration ==\n\n=== Academic entities ===\n\n==== Faculty of Architecture ====\nThe Faculty of Architecture offers six Honours Degrees such as Bachelor of Architecture, Bachelor of Landscape Architecture, Bachelor of Design, Bachelor of Science in Quantity Surveying, Bachelor of Science in Facilities Management, Bachelor of Science in Town & Country Planning.

Its origin can be traced to the [[Maradana College of Technology|Government Technical College]] (GTC) which was established in Maradana, Colombo in 1893.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.cebeu.lk/cebeuw/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/UoM.pdf|title=The Birth of a University - 50th Anniversary Publication|last=|first=|publisher=The Association of Pioneer Engineers of University of Moratuwa|year=2016|isbn=|location=Sri Lanka|pages=56 - 61}}</ref>\n\nThe GTC was one of the first institutions for formal technical education in Sri Lanka (the [[Ceylon Medical School]] was established in 1870, followed by [[Colombo Law College]] (1875), School of Agriculture (1884) and the [[Government Technical College]] (1893)). It became the pioneering institution for science education in Sri Lanka and its name was changed to the [[Ceylon Technical College]] (CTC) in 1906. The CTC provided technical education in civil, [[Electrical Engineering|electrical]] and [[mechanical engineering]] fields even before the establishment of the [[University College Colombo]], affiliated to the [[University of London]], in 1921.\n\nThe CTC at Katubedda first earned University status, as the Katubedda Campus of the single [[University of Ceylon]], on 15 February 1972. The Department of Architecture, then at Colombo, was transferred to Katubedda in the formation of this new campus. The Katubedda Campus thus began with one faculty, that of Engineering and Architecture. The first president was Dr. [[LH Sumanadasa]] who steered the progress of the institution and was the principal of the IPT before it became the Katubedda Campus. When Ceylon became a Republic on 22 May 1972, the corporate name of the university was changed to the [[University of Sri Lanka]].\n\nIn 1978 it gained the Independent University Status under Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.<ref name=history>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.uom.lk/history|publisher=University of Moratuwa|accessdate=11 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Organisation and administration ==\n\n=== Academic entities ===\n\n==== Faculty of Architecture ====\nThe Faculty of Architecture offers six Honours Degrees such as Bachelor of Architecture, Bachelor of Landscape Architecture, Bachelor of Design, Bachelor of Science in Quantity Surveying, Bachelor of Science in Facilities Management, Bachelor of Science in Town & Country Planning.

It is located at 1001 E. Howe St., [[Bunnell, Florida|Bunnell]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. Interestingly, it never served as a schoolhouse as it was used as Bunnell High School's vocational agriculture department and housed the local chapter of the Future Farmers of America, which is now known as the [[National FFA Organization]]. The building is also often mistaken for a one-room schoolhouse, but it actually has two large rooms and a smaller storage room. This building is one of only three structures built in Flagler County during the [[Great Depression]] with funding provided by [[New Deal]] dollars. The other two are the [[Bunnell Coquina City Hall]] and the [[Flagler County Jail (WPA-Built)]].<ref name=\"JayeR\">Jaye, Randy. Flagler County, Florida: A Centennial History.

A. Duncan, a representative of the Florida State Planning Board, to discuss ideas and future plans to improve the county's public school infrastructure.<ref name=\"NRHP\" />\n\nThe school board turned to Zachary D. Holland, the local Works Projects Administration (WPA) supervisor, for assistance in completing its WPA application, which was authorized for funding in late-1937. The federal agency agreed to supply the labor, or approximately eighty percent of the cost of the project, and the school board paid for the materials. In January 1938, the school board developed a materials list, which included 8,000 common hard bricks and 15,000 rough, or craft, textured bricks, Portland cement, builder's lime, and various finished wood products and sizes of nails. A Bunnell builder's supply store, Johnsons Incorporated, was awarded the materials bid. WPA supervisor Holland broke ground on the project later that month, anticipating construction to be completed in mid-1938. Holland completed the new school building in July 1938, and delivered the keys to the school board. The cost of construction amounted to $5,091.22 of which the school board provided $1,474.22.<ref name=\"NRHP\" />\n\nThe physical plant of the high school consisted of four buildings: the main brick high school, the brick vocational agriculture building, a small wood-frame structure with tin sheathing for five buses, and a small wood-frame janitorial storage building.<ref name=\"Clegg\">Clegg, John A.

Students met daily in the building, studying agricultural topics and planting methods in the classroom, working on projects in the shop, and traveling to nearby agricultural fields to plant, cultivate, and harvest crops. Between 1938 and 1942, students held fund-raising activities to travel to Havana, Cuba, World's Fair in New York City, Washington, D. C., and the Florida State Fair in Tampa.<ref name=\"NRHP\" />\n\nIn 1940, the Bunnell FFA chapter earned the highest rank in Florida's FFA high school statewide program. Judges assessed students for achievement in community service leadership, cooperative activities, earnings and savings from demonstration plots, and recreational and scholarship activities.<ref name=\"NRHP\" />\n\n==Usage as a Storage Facility==\n\nThe building housed the school's vocational agriculture training and FFA activities until 1970, when a fire severely damaged the main two-story high school building. After considerable debate, the high school was rebuilt at a new site on State Road 100 and Bunnell  Elementary School was relocated to the old high school campus and re-built. Although the former high school building was razed and the hard-fire brick salvaged for resale, the former vocational agriculture building remained untouched. In the process of the clearing of the former foundations and construction of the new elementary school, the former agriculture building became a storage facility and then a liability that was boarded up and not maintained.<ref name=\"LondonA\">London, Aaron.

After receiving approval from the Flagler County School Board, the teachers embarked on fund raising efforts under the aegis of the Friends of the Little Red Schoolhouse. Brown and Latham left the following year for positions at the newly-built Wadsworth Elementary School in Palm Coast. Assisted by faculty and staff members Richard DuPont, Nancy McFeeley, and Nancy Willis, Marquis led the effort to carry on the vision of rescuing the building from deterioration and destruction. Marquis secured contributions for the preservation project from many organizations, including the Bunnell Elementary School Parent-Teacher Organization, Cultural Heritage Study Group, Flagler Beach Women's Club, Hammock Women's Club, ITT-Palm Coast, and Palm Coast Women's Club. Among other activities, school children made small miniatures of the old school for placement in stores and businesses in the community to collect funds and promote awareness of the project. Her efforts were supplemented in 1992 with a Blueprint 2000 grant for $10,000 from the Florida Legislature. In addition to obtaining financial resources.<ref name=\"ShannaF\">Fortier, Shanna.

Built in 1942, one cabinet was donated by Rem Murray, a former student who fabricated the furniture in the building as a vocational project. Among the artifacts are original wood school desks, many pictures and newspaper articles, Native American artifacts, as 48 star U.S.A. flag, an August 27, 1918 original signed letter from [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] when she was principal of the Daytona Educational and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls Incorporated and a March 3, 1932 letter to [[Charles Lindberg]] regarding the kidnapping of his son from Z.E.

It is located at 1001 E. Howe St., [[Bunnell, Florida|Bunnell]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. Interestingly, it never served as a schoolhouse as it was used as Bunnell High School's vocational agriculture department and housed the local chapter of the Future Farmers of America, which is now known as the [[National FFA Organization]]. The building is also often mistaken for a one-room schoolhouse, but it actually has two large rooms and a smaller storage room. This building is one of only three structures built in Flagler County during the [[Great Depression]] with funding provided by [[New Deal]] dollars. The other two are the [[Bunnell Coquina City Hall]] and the [[Flagler County Jail (WPA-Built)]].<ref name=\"JayeR\">Jaye, Randy. Flagler County, Florida: A Centennial History.

A. Duncan, a representative of the Florida State Planning Board, to discuss ideas and future plans to improve the county's public school infrastructure.<ref name=\"NRHP\" />\n\nThe school board turned to Zachary D. Holland, the local Works Projects Administration (WPA) supervisor, for assistance in completing its WPA application, which was authorized for funding in late-1937. The federal agency agreed to supply the labor, or approximately eighty percent of the cost of the project, and the school board paid for the materials. In January 1938, the school board developed a materials list, which included 8,000 common hard bricks and 15,000 rough, or craft, textured bricks, Portland cement, builder's lime, and various finished wood products and sizes of nails. A Bunnell builder's supply store, Johnsons Incorporated, was awarded the materials bid. WPA supervisor Holland broke ground on the project later that month, anticipating construction to be completed in mid-1938. Holland completed the new school building in July 1938, and delivered the keys to the school board. The cost of construction amounted to $5,091.22 of which the school board provided $1,474.22.<ref name=\"NRHP\" />\n\nThe physical plant of the high school consisted of four buildings: the main brick high school, the brick vocational agriculture building, a small wood-frame structure with tin sheathing for five buses, and a small wood-frame janitorial storage building.<ref name=\"Clegg\">Clegg, John A.

Students met daily in the building, studying agricultural topics and planting methods in the classroom, working on projects in the shop, and traveling to nearby agricultural fields to plant, cultivate, and harvest crops. Between 1938 and 1942, students held fund-raising activities to travel to Havana, Cuba, World's Fair in New York City, Washington, D. C., and the Florida State Fair in Tampa.<ref name=\"NRHP\" />\n\nIn 1940, the Bunnell FFA chapter earned the highest rank in Florida's FFA high school statewide program. Judges assessed students for achievement in community service leadership, cooperative activities, earnings and savings from demonstration plots, and recreational and scholarship activities.<ref name=\"NRHP\" />\n\n==Usage as a Storage Facility==\n\nThe building housed the school's vocational agriculture training and FFA activities until 1970, when a fire severely damaged the main two-story high school building. After considerable debate, the high school was rebuilt at a new site on State Road 100 and Bunnell  Elementary School was relocated to the old high school campus and re-built. Although the former high school building was razed and the hard-fire brick salvaged for resale, the former vocational agriculture building remained untouched. In the process of the clearing of the former foundations and construction of the new elementary school, the former agriculture building became a storage facility and then a liability that was boarded up and not maintained.<ref name=\"LondonA\">London, Aaron.

After receiving approval from the Flagler County School Board, the teachers embarked on fund raising efforts under the aegis of the Friends of the Little Red Schoolhouse. Brown and Latham left the following year for positions at the newly-built Wadsworth Elementary School in Palm Coast. Assisted by faculty and staff members Richard DuPont, Nancy McFeeley, and Nancy Willis, Marquis led the effort to carry on the vision of rescuing the building from deterioration and destruction. Marquis secured contributions for the preservation project from many organizations, including the Bunnell Elementary School Parent-Teacher Organization, Cultural Heritage Study Group, Flagler Beach Women's Club, Hammock Women's Club, ITT-Palm Coast, and Palm Coast Women's Club. Among other activities, school children made small miniatures of the old school for placement in stores and businesses in the community to collect funds and promote awareness of the project. Her efforts were supplemented in 1992 with a Blueprint 2000 grant for $10,000 from the Florida Legislature. In addition to obtaining financial resources.<ref name=\"ShannaF\">Fortier, Shanna.

Built in 1942, one cabinet was donated by Rem Murray, a former student who fabricated the furniture in the building as a vocational project. Among the artifacts are original wood school desks, many pictures and newspaper articles, Native American artifacts, as 48 star U.S.A. flag, an August 27, 1918 original signed letter from [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] when she was principal of the Daytona Educational and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls Incorporated and a March 3, 1932 letter to [[Charles Lindberg]] regarding the kidnapping of his son from Z.E.

Though it was not finally established until 1956, the process of founding a Jesuit high school in Portland began in 1907, when property was purchased by the parish of St. Ignatius and set aside for a future high school. A lay appeal to the Jesuit Provincial for a high school in 1929 came to nothing. In 1954 the Holy Cross Fathers of Portland announced the closing of Columbia Prep and a plan for the Jesuits to take over the premises was discussed, but again dropped. Finally in 1955 the Jesuit [[Provincial Superior]] was asked by the Archbishop to set up a school.

It was founded by the Oregon Province, [[Society of Jesus]], in 1956 and uses a [[Jesuit]], [[college-preparatory]] curriculum. It is [[coeducation]]al and enrolls approximately 1,300 students of all faiths.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}\nThe school was the 43rd [[List of Jesuit secondary schools in the United States|Jesuit high school]] to be established in the United States. Though it was not finally established until 1956, the process of founding a Jesuit high school in Portland began in 1907, when property was purchased by the parish of St. Ignatius and set aside for a future high school. A lay appeal to the Jesuit Provincial for a high school in 1929 came to nothing. In 1954 the Holy Cross Fathers of Portland announced the closing of Columbia Prep and a plan for the Jesuits to take over the premises was discussed, but again dropped. Finally in 1955 the Jesuit [[Provincial Superior]] was asked by the Archbishop to set up a school. Hillsdale Dairy Farm, a {{convert|55|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot to the west, some 15 minutes drive from downtown Portland, was purchased for $165,000. Jesuit and Holy Cross priests raised pledges of $117,000 by Wednesday of the first week of a fund-raising campaign in [[church (building)|church]]es, and hundreds of thousands more by door-to-door canvassing. Jesuit High School opened for freshmen boys on September 10, 1956 and girls have been admitted since 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jesuitportland.org/userlogin.cfm?pp=522&userrequest=YES&keyrequest=NO&userpage=522|title=Jesuit High School : A Catholic College Preparatory High School in the Jesuit Tradition: Member Login|website=www.jesuitportland.org|access-date=2016-03-12}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nThe demographic breakdown of the 1,280 students enrolled in 2013-14 was:<ref name=\"ed.gov\"/>\n*Native American/Alaskan - 0.2%\n*Black - 3.4%\n*Hispanic - 4.6%\n*Multiracial - 7.2%\n*Asian/Pacific islanders - 10.2%\n*White - 74.4%\n\n==Academics==\nJesuit High School has been accredited through [[Northwest Accreditation Commission]] since 1961.<ref name=\"naas\">{{cite web|url=http://www.advanc-ed.org/oasis2/u/par/accreditation/summary?institutionId=52277|title=AdvancED - Institution Summary|work=advanc-ed.org|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989 and 1998, Jesuit High School was honored in the [[Blue Ribbon Schools Program]], the highest honor a school can receive in the United States.<ref name=\"blueribbon\">[http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf Archived: Blue Ribbon Schools Program, Schools Recognized 1982-1983 Through 1999-2002 (PDF)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326055622/http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\nJesuit is one of the premier and elite Nike-sponsored high schools in the state of [[Oregon]] and the entire [[United States]].
