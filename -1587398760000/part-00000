De Brito made a modest fortune in the [[Manila galleon]] trade in the 16th century. He was also a regidor of Manila, whose post was adjudged to him at public auction for one thousand four hundred pesos of common gold, with the third part of what was promised from the increase. He took possession of his post on 24 June 1589.\n\nIn 1589, he acquired at a public auction a sprawling marshland measuring 4940 hectares, a part of which would become the 20th-century Makati. After his acquisition of the land, Capitan de Brito immediately took steps to \"discharge the royal conscience\", to fulfill, for the King of Spain, his duty to spread the Christian gospel. This effort was stymied, however, by local resistance to the forced dispossession of the land.\n\nThe Spaniards then assigned the area to the town of Santa Ana de Sapa and in the 1600s<ref name=\"History of Makati City\">{{cite web |url=http://www.manilainfo.blogspot.com/2010/05/history-of-makati.html|title=History of Makati City |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |publisher=Manila Info Blogspot}}</ref> began to be developed as a pilgrimage center around the churches of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] (now [[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Gracia Church|Our Lady of Grace]], opened 1625) and of Saints Peter and Paul (opened 1620) in what is today the ''[[Makati Poblacion|poblaci\u00f3n]]'', built by missionary friars to attract worshippers, and also as a farming community. It became an independent municipality in 1670, and was christened ''San Pedro de Macati'' in honour of the town's [[patron saint|patron]], [[Saint Peter]]. The town was also famous for its pottery industry since the 18th century, with skilled potters trained by [[Jesuit]] priests.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Its strategic location also made it a pitstop for pilgrims, travelling by foot or boat, towards the shrine of [[Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage]] in [[Antipolo]]. Beginning in the early 19th century, the church has been directly administered by diocesean secular clergy.\n\nIn 1718 the Jesuits brought the Image of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Virgen de la Rosa  from Acapulco Mexico to the small town, it was later enthroned at the [[San Pedro Macati Church]] where it resides to this very day, and will mark its 300th anniversary in June 2018.  Until the Filipino American War, the image had an ivory head and hands and a reliquary on her breast which contained a strand of a hair of the Blessed Virgin Mary, both of them stolen and were never recovered at the same time while the church served as a hospital, and are today replaced by an oval cavity and a wooden head and hands. The city's feast days on June 29, the feast of Apostles Peter and Paul, and June 30, the feast of Our Lady of the Rose are marked with the \"Panatang Sayaw\", as the Bailes de los Arcos (Dance of the Arches) are called, are an old tradition going back at least to the beginnings of the 19th century as a dance to thank the city patrons for blessings received by its people<ref>Old Makati and the Bailes de los Arcos by [[Alejandro Roces]]</ref> and by a number of events organized by city and religious leaders.\n\nIn 1851, Don Jos\u00e9 Bonifacio R\u00f3xas (an ancestor of the [[Z\u00f3bel de Ayala family]]) purchased the [[Jesuit]] estate of \"[[Hacienda]] San Pedro de Macati\" for 52,800 pesos.<ref>{{cite web|title=This week in Ayala history|url=http://www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph/news/55?start=5|work=Filipinas Library|publisher=www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph|accessdate=6 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111161251/http://www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph/news/55?start=5|archive-date=11 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since then, the development of Makati has remained linked with the [[Z\u00f3bel de Ayala family]] and their company, [[Ayala Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History - Pioneers|url=http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/pioneers.html|publisher=Ayala Group Official Website|accessdate=6 September 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060056/http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/pioneers.html|archivedate=21 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe town was a cradle of Filipino passive resistance against Spanish colonial rule in the 1890s and the subsequent [[Philippine Revolution]], with the participation of the local [[Katipunan]] council based in the area with [[Pio del Pilar]], a local resident from the village of Culi-Culi, as its president.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Culi-Culi is now a barangay named in honour of Del Pilar.\n\n===American period===\nBy 1898, [[Spain]] ceded the Philippines and other overseas possessions to the [[United States]] after the former's defeat in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. In 1901, the Americans declared the whole area south of the Pasig River, including the town of San Pedro de Macati, down to [[Alabang]] in [[Muntinlupa]], a US military reservation, thus establishing [[Fort William McKinley|Fort McKinley]] (now [[Fort Bonifacio]]). That same year, the whole town, with a population of 25,000, was incorporated from the Province of [[Manila (province)|Manila]] to the new province of [[Rizal]], with Marcelino Magsaysay serving as the town president.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} As the 1910s approached, the [[Meralco]] tranvia lines to Fort McKinley and to the western end of the town were built, opening transport lines for its residents and thus brought along potential investors who opened several businesses including the famous Santa Ana Cabaret at the terminus of the streetcar lines.\n\nOn February 28, 1914, the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Philippine Legislature]] passed Act 2390, shortening the name, San Pedro de Macati, to simply Makati.\n\nIn 1937, the airport [[Nielsen Field]] opened in what is now the [[Ayala Triangle]], the control tower of which still exists and is currently a restaurant.  The tracks of the now [[Philippine National Railways]] reached Makatie early in the decade. During that same period, [[Santa Ana Park]], the nation's second horse racing facility, opened to expectations from horse racing fans.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n===Post-war===\n[[File:Manila December 1982-5.jpg|thumbnail|left|Ayala Avenue (1982).]]\n\nAfter the destruction [[Second World War]] had brought upon Manila, and the subsequent closure of [[Nielson Field]], the town grew rapidly, and real estate values boomed. The first of the planned communities (in what are now the barangays [[Forbes Park, Makati|Forbes Park]], Urdaneta, San Lorenzo and [[Bel-Air Village|Bel-Air]]) were established in the 1950s with the efforts of its landowner, [[Ayala Corporation|Ayala y Compa\u00f1\u00eda]]. At the same time, Fort McKinley, then renamed Fort Bonifacio, and the then [[Philippine Army]] headquarters, became the starting point for the building up of seven more communities by military families who worked in the base area. The first office buildings were built on what is now the [[Makati Central Business District]]. Since the late 1960s, Makati has transformed into the financial and commercial capital of the country.<ref name=\"History of Makati City\"/>\n\nDuring the terms of town mayors M\u00e1ximo Estrella, Rafael Ba\u00f1ola, Jos\u00e9 Luciano, C\u00e9zar Alzona and Nemesio Yabut, massive development of the town took place, and foreign and local investors were welcomed to what was tagged as the nation's number one municipality at the time. Makati's central location adjacent to the city of [[Manila]] also made it an industrial hub for major national and international corporations. Partly as a result a new town hall just miles from the old one was built in 1962 just along [[J.P. Rizal Avenue]] (the old hall was later converted into the city museum). Mayor Ba\u00f1ola's term of office as town executive saw the building up of what is now the [[Ayala Center]] with the help of the Ayala firm, which would become the city's central shopping center of today.\n\nIn 1975, Makati was separated from Rizal province along with [[Caloocan]], [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]], [[Quezon City]], [[Marikina]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Pasig]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], [[Taguig]], [[Pasay City]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], [[Las Pi\u00f1as]], and [[Muntinlupa]], to become part of the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] as a component municipality.\n\nFollowing the [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|assassination]] of opposition senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] on 21 August 1983, Makati became a nexus for protests against the dictatorship of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]]. Known as the ''Confetti Revolution'', the demonstrations held in the central business district were led partly by employees of major corporations based in the area, culminating in the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] that toppled Marcos\u2019 20-year authoritarian regime. His political rival and successor, [[Corazon C. Aquino]]\u2013the wife of the deceased senator Aquino\u2013became the eleventh and first female president of the Philippines. After the death of Mayor Yabut during the Revolution, Aquino appointed [[Jejomar Binay]] as acting mayor of the town of Makati; he was subsequently [[1988 Philippine local elections|elected as mayor]] in 1988. His first term as the town executive would see the events of a 1989 [[coup d'etat]] attempt in the town's business district, and would help usher the building of the country's first skyscrapers in the early 1990s and full cityhood in 1995.\n\n[[File:Bonifacio Global City contested between Taguig and Makati.svg|thumb|Maps of Makati and Taguig with disputed land|180px|right]]\nOn May 17, 2000 at 5:02&nbsp;p.m., the [[Glorietta|Glorietta Mall]] located inside the [[Ayala Center]] was bombed, injuring 13 persons.

During its early years, it was among the top three hotels in the country - along with the Manila [[Hilton hotels|Hilton]] in Ermita and the Savoy Hotel (later becoming the [[Hyatt]] Regency) in Pasay City.  It closed in 2015 and the building was demolished shortly thereafter to give way to a new development to be named One Ayala.\n\n===Hagdang Bato===\nThis part of [[Kingdom of Namayan|Namayan]] was sacred to early [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]].

It opened in 1960 and was demolished in 1989 to give way to the construction of the [[Makati Shangri-La, Manila|Makati Shangri-la]] hotel (opened in 1993) which presently stands on the site.\n\nIt shared the same name as the Cinematografo Rizal located in [[Manila]], which was the first cinema not owned by foreigners.  This establishment, owned by Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez, opened as a movie house in 1903 and five years later its address was recorded as 155 [[Recto Avenue|Calle Azc\u00e1rraga]] in [[Tondo, Manila]].  About a decade later its address was Calle Ilaya (now Ilaya Street) and Calle Azc\u00e1rraga in Tondo.\n\n=== Santa Ana Cabaret ===\nThis twentieth-century [[nightclub]] ([http://www.cnac.org/emilscott/canson_chickese01.htm photos]), owned by an American named John Canson, was once advertised as being the largest [[cabaret]] in the world. It opened in Tejeros in 1921 and was in business until 1970, when a [[Typhoon Patsy (1970)|typhoon]] destroyed it. Famous patrons included President [[Manuel Quezon]], [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Francis Burton Harrison|Francis Harrison]], and General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. It is also said that [[Edward VIII|Edward]], [[Prince of Wales]] once visited it. During World War II it was converted into a garment factory, producing shirts and military uniforms for the Japanese. After the Americans returned to Makati in February 1945, they converted their famous dance hall into a temporary medical facility. It was the forerunner of fashionable discos of the eighties and nineties, such as Manila's classy Stargazer, as well as Makati's Euphoria, Faces, and Mars.  Its modern counterpart is the Valkyrie Nightclub in Taguig.\n\n===Santa Ana Racetrack===\nOpened in 1937 by the Philippine Racing Club, it was the first notable [[sport venue]] of Makati, and was the forerunner of other famous Makati sport venues where international competitions were held such as the Manila Golf Club, which located in Makati in 1948, the Manila Polo Club, which relocated to Makati in 1950, and the defunct [[QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup|Astrobowl Magallanes]].  It was larger than the San Lazaro Racetrack in [[Santa Cruz, Manila]].\n \nDuring World War II it became a military storage area, and as a consequence was targeted by aerial bombardment toward the end of the war. On 9 February 1945, it was at the Philippine Racing Club grounds that the Americans, advancing from Wack Wack golf club ([http://www.silverlensgalleries.com/artist.php?teodulo-protomartir=155 photo no. 26a]) and crossing the Pasig River using [[amtrac]]s, returned to Makati. Afterward, they built a [[pontoon bridge]] ([http://battlingbastardsbataan.com/james.htm seventh photo]) which was one of two such temporary bridges they had to build after the last remaining bridges spanning the Pasig River\u2014Banzai (Jones) and Santa Cruz (MacArthur)\u2014were blown on 5 February. This pontoon bridge was damaged and knocked out by artillery fire on 10 and 11 February and was reported as having been repaired ([http://www.ww2online.org/image/philippine-refugees-stream-across-pontoon-bridge-spanning-upper-pasig-river-manila-26-february photo]). The Art-deco buildings of the racetrack were later used as a headquarters by US General MacArthur and also by [[Allied Translator and Interpreter Section|Allied translators and interpreters]].\n\nHorse racing resumed during the postcolonial period. Toward the end of the twentieth century, an increase in the taxation of winnings combined with a rise in the ownership of TV sets led to a decline in attendance, which resulted in the closure of the racetrack in December 2008 and its demolition in 2013.\n\n===Santiago Hospital===\nThe Santiago Hospital was a twentieth-century [[Health facility|medical facility]] in Poblaci\u00f3n. Originally named ''Hospital Espa\u00f1ol de Santiago'', it was founded in 1902 in Manila by the Spanish community as an infectious hospital for the hospitalization of Spaniards who, having to comply with sanitary regulations concerning compulsory hospitalization, preferred the services of this hospital rather than those of the public San Lazaro Hospital.  Its earliest known address was 1819 [[List of renamed streets in Metro Manila|Calle Azc\u00e1rraga]], Quiapo. In 1929, the hospital moved into its own building, an Art-deco structure in Makati, and at the beginning of the thirties was one of two hospitals in Rizal Province. By 1935, this medical facility, which had thirty-four beds, was classified as a general hospital which treated all sorts of diseases except those requiring compulsory segregation in government institutions, and by that time was admitting patients of nationalities other than Spanish.\n\nDuring World War II, Santiago Hospital was administered by the [[Sisters of Charity of St. Paul|Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres]], and in February 1945 it had the distinction of being the only hospital in the Greater Manila area which remained open throughout the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]].  Santiago Hospital, which was once considered to be one of the best hospitals in the Philippines, closed in the 1960s as a result of the increasing urbanization of Makati.\n\nAlthough generally believed to be Makati's first hospital, it was preceded by a hospital in Guadalupe which existed during the [[First Philippine Republic|First Republic]].  Also over a decade earlier in 1884, the Spanish briefly operated in Guadalupe an orphanage, a type of institution which in their point of view was a medical facility.  In 1917, the Americans also opened an orphanage in Makati, at Casa Quinta.\n\n==Culture and sports==\n[[File:Ayala Museum.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Ayala Museum]]]]\nMakati is home to a number of fine art museums, colonial-era churches and recreation areas. Along the south-eastern border of Makati beyond [[Forbes Park, Makati City|Forbes Park]] are the [[Manila Golf Club]] and the Manila Polo Club.<ref>[http://www.manilapolo.com.ph/ Manila Polo Club | 100 years].

The [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (EDSA) pass along the city's southeast part and connects it with the cities of [[Mandaluyong]] and [[Pasay]]. The [[South Luzon Expressway]] (SLEX) runs through the city's western part and connects it with the city of [[Manila]] to the north and with southern Metro Manila. The [[Manila Skyway]], an elevated highway built on top of SLEX, provides residents coming from southern Metro Manila a fast way to reach Makati. SLEX and EDSA intersect at the [[Magallanes Interchange]], which is the most complex system of elevated roadways in Metro Manila.\n\nBuses plying the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA/C-4) route from [[Baclaran]] in [[Para\u00f1aque]] to [[Quezon City]] and [[Caloocan]] pass through the central business/financial district daily. [[Jeepney]]s ply Makati's inner roads and connect the city to its surrounding towns and cities.\n\nThe country's first-ever e-jeepney and hybrid bus services were piloted in Makati. The buses are parallel electric hybrids, powered by an electric motor and a Euro 3 diesel motor. The hybrid buses ply the route from [[Gil Puyat Avenue]] (Tramo/LRT-1 Taft) to [[Kalayaan Avenue]] (C-5), which are considered among the busiest in the city's central business district, cutting through other major roads like South Superhighway; Chino Roces, Ayala and Makati Avenues; [[Paseo de Roxas]] and EDSA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/397543/1st-hybrid-buses-in-ph-to-roll-out-in-makati#ixzz2XEAbg7cB|title=Hybrid buses to roll out in Ph|date=|accessdate=2013-06-25 | format=}}</ref>\n\nOther major roads in the city include [[Gil Puyat Avenue]], which connects EDSA and SLEX in the north; [[Ayala Avenue]], an important street that runs through the [[Makati CBD]]; and [[Makati Avenue]], which connects Ayala Avenue with Gil Puyat Avenue, also extending north to cross the Pasig River to Mandaluyong.

De Brito made a modest fortune in the [[Manila galleon]] trade in the 16th century. He was also a regidor of Manila, whose post was adjudged to him at public auction for one thousand four hundred pesos of common gold, with the third part of what was promised from the increase. He took possession of his post on 24 June 1589.\n\nIn 1589, he acquired at a public auction a sprawling marshland measuring 4940 hectares, a part of which would become the 20th-century Makati. After his acquisition of the land, Capitan de Brito immediately took steps to \"discharge the royal conscience\", to fulfill, for the King of Spain, his duty to spread the Christian gospel. This effort was stymied, however, by local resistance to the forced dispossession of the land.\n\nThe Spaniards then assigned the area to the town of Santa Ana de Sapa and in the 1600s<ref name=\"History of Makati City\">{{cite web |url=http://www.manilainfo.blogspot.com/2010/05/history-of-makati.html|title=History of Makati City |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |publisher=Manila Info Blogspot}}</ref> began to be developed as a pilgrimage center around the churches of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] (now [[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Gracia Church|Our Lady of Grace]], opened 1625) and of Saints Peter and Paul (opened 1620) in what is today the ''[[Makati Poblacion|poblaci\u00f3n]]'', built by missionary friars to attract worshippers, and also as a farming community. It became an independent municipality in 1670, and was christened ''San Pedro de Macati'' in honour of the town's [[patron saint|patron]], [[Saint Peter]]. The town was also famous for its pottery industry since the 18th century, with skilled potters trained by [[Jesuit]] priests.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Its strategic location also made it a pitstop for pilgrims, travelling by foot or boat, towards the shrine of [[Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage]] in [[Antipolo]]. Beginning in the early 19th century, the church has been directly administered by diocesean secular clergy.\n\nIn 1718 the Jesuits brought the Image of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Virgen de la Rosa  from Acapulco Mexico to the small town, it was later enthroned at the [[San Pedro Macati Church]] where it resides to this very day, and will mark its 300th anniversary in June 2018.  Until the Filipino American War, the image had an ivory head and hands and a reliquary on her breast which contained a strand of a hair of the Blessed Virgin Mary, both of them stolen and were never recovered at the same time while the church served as a hospital, and are today replaced by an oval cavity and a wooden head and hands. The city's feast days on June 29, the feast of Apostles Peter and Paul, and June 30, the feast of Our Lady of the Rose are marked with the \"Panatang Sayaw\", as the Bailes de los Arcos (Dance of the Arches) are called, are an old tradition going back at least to the beginnings of the 19th century as a dance to thank the city patrons for blessings received by its people<ref>Old Makati and the Bailes de los Arcos by [[Alejandro Roces]]</ref> and by a number of events organized by city and religious leaders.\n\nIn 1851, Don Jos\u00e9 Bonifacio R\u00f3xas (an ancestor of the [[Z\u00f3bel de Ayala family]]) purchased the [[Jesuit]] estate of \"[[Hacienda]] San Pedro de Macati\" for 52,800 pesos.<ref>{{cite web|title=This week in Ayala history|url=http://www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph/news/55?start=5|work=Filipinas Library|publisher=www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph|accessdate=6 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111161251/http://www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph/news/55?start=5|archive-date=11 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since then, the development of Makati has remained linked with the [[Z\u00f3bel de Ayala family]] and their company, [[Ayala Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History - Pioneers|url=http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/pioneers.html|publisher=Ayala Group Official Website|accessdate=6 September 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060056/http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/pioneers.html|archivedate=21 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe town was a cradle of Filipino passive resistance against Spanish colonial rule in the 1890s and the subsequent [[Philippine Revolution]], with the participation of the local [[Katipunan]] council based in the area with [[Pio del Pilar]], a local resident from the village of Culi-Culi, as its president.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Culi-Culi is now a barangay named in honour of Del Pilar.\n\n===American period===\nBy 1898, [[Spain]] ceded the Philippines and other overseas possessions to the [[United States]] after the former's defeat in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. In 1901, the Americans declared the whole area south of the Pasig River, including the town of San Pedro de Macati, down to [[Alabang]] in [[Muntinlupa]], a US military reservation, thus establishing [[Fort William McKinley|Fort McKinley]] (now [[Fort Bonifacio]]). That same year, the whole town, with a population of 25,000, was incorporated from the Province of [[Manila (province)|Manila]] to the new province of [[Rizal]], with Marcelino Magsaysay serving as the town president.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} As the 1910s approached, the [[Meralco]] tranvia lines to Fort McKinley and to the western end of the town were built, opening transport lines for its residents and thus brought along potential investors who opened several businesses including the famous Santa Ana Cabaret at the terminus of the streetcar lines.\n\nOn February 28, 1914, the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Philippine Legislature]] passed Act 2390, shortening the name, San Pedro de Macati, to simply Makati.\n\nIn 1937, the airport [[Nielsen Field]] opened in what is now the [[Ayala Triangle]], the control tower of which still exists and is currently a restaurant.  The tracks of the now [[Philippine National Railways]] reached Makatie early in the decade. During that same period, [[Santa Ana Park]], the nation's second horse racing facility, opened to expectations from horse racing fans.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n===Post-war===\n[[File:Manila December 1982-5.jpg|thumbnail|left|Ayala Avenue (1982).]]\n\nAfter the destruction [[Second World War]] had brought upon Manila, and the subsequent closure of [[Nielson Field]], the town grew rapidly, and real estate values boomed. The first of the planned communities (in what are now the barangays [[Forbes Park, Makati|Forbes Park]], Urdaneta, San Lorenzo and [[Bel-Air Village|Bel-Air]]) were established in the 1950s with the efforts of its landowner, [[Ayala Corporation|Ayala y Compa\u00f1\u00eda]]. At the same time, Fort McKinley, then renamed Fort Bonifacio, and the then [[Philippine Army]] headquarters, became the starting point for the building up of seven more communities by military families who worked in the base area. The first office buildings were built on what is now the [[Makati Central Business District]]. Since the late 1960s, Makati has transformed into the financial and commercial capital of the country.<ref name=\"History of Makati City\"/>\n\nDuring the terms of town mayors M\u00e1ximo Estrella, Rafael Ba\u00f1ola, Jos\u00e9 Luciano, C\u00e9zar Alzona and Nemesio Yabut, massive development of the town took place, and foreign and local investors were welcomed to what was tagged as the nation's number one municipality at the time. Makati's central location adjacent to the city of [[Manila]] also made it an industrial hub for major national and international corporations. Partly as a result a new town hall just miles from the old one was built in 1962 just along [[J.P. Rizal Avenue]] (the old hall was later converted into the city museum). Mayor Ba\u00f1ola's term of office as town executive saw the building up of what is now the [[Ayala Center]] with the help of the Ayala firm, which would become the city's central shopping center of today.\n\nIn 1975, Makati was separated from Rizal province along with [[Caloocan]], [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]], [[Quezon City]], [[Marikina]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Pasig]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], [[Taguig]], [[Pasay City]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], [[Las Pi\u00f1as]], and [[Muntinlupa]], to become part of the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] as a component municipality.\n\nFollowing the [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|assassination]] of opposition senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] on 21 August 1983, Makati became a nexus for protests against the dictatorship of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]]. Known as the ''Confetti Revolution'', the demonstrations held in the central business district were led partly by employees of major corporations based in the area, culminating in the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] that toppled Marcos\u2019 20-year authoritarian regime. His political rival and successor, [[Corazon C. Aquino]]\u2013the wife of the deceased senator Aquino\u2013became the eleventh and first female president of the Philippines. After the death of Mayor Yabut during the Revolution, Aquino appointed [[Jejomar Binay]] as acting mayor of the town of Makati; he was subsequently [[1988 Philippine local elections|elected as mayor]] in 1988. His first term as the town executive would see the events of a 1989 [[coup d'etat]] attempt in the town's business district, and would help usher the building of the country's first skyscrapers in the early 1990s and full cityhood in 1995.\n\n[[File:Bonifacio Global City contested between Taguig and Makati.svg|thumb|Maps of Makati and Taguig with disputed land|180px|right]]\nOn May 17, 2000 at 5:02&nbsp;p.m., the [[Glorietta|Glorietta Mall]] located inside the [[Ayala Center]] was bombed, injuring 13 persons.

During its early years, it was among the top three hotels in the country - along with the Manila [[Hilton hotels|Hilton]] in Ermita and the Savoy Hotel (later becoming the [[Hyatt]] Regency) in Pasay City.  It closed in 2015 and the building was demolished shortly thereafter to give way to a new development to be named One Ayala.\n\n===Hagdang Bato===\nThis part of [[Kingdom of Namayan|Namayan]] was sacred to early [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]].  Hagdang bat\u00f3 (see [https://mbasic.facebook.com/DiscoverOldPhilippines/photos/a.370149673073438.90061.201102429978164/588672527887817/?type=1&source=46&refid=17 photo]) is mentioned in chapter sixty-one of [[Jose Rizal|Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'s first novel, ''[[Noli Me T\u00e1ngere (novel)|Noli Me T\u00e1ngere]]'', and chapter three of his second novel, ''[[El Filibusterismo]]''. During the [[Philippine Revolution|Revolution]] on 10 June 1897, Gen. [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] and about five hundred soldiers crossed the [[Pasig River]] at Hagdang bat\u00f3 during the march to [[Republic of Biak-na-Bato|Biac-na-bat\u00f3]] in [[Bulacan|Bulac\u00e1n]].\n\n===Rizal Theater===\nThis was the first luxury [[movie theater]] and performance venue in Makati and was located south of the [[Makati Avenue|Makati]] and [[Ayala Avenue|Ayala]] avenues intersection.  It opened in 1960 and was demolished in 1989 to give way to the construction of the [[Makati Shangri-La, Manila|Makati Shangri-la]] hotel (opened in 1993) which presently stands on the site.\n\nIt shared the same name as the Cinematografo Rizal located in [[Manila]], which was the first cinema not owned by foreigners.  This establishment, owned by Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez, opened as a movie house in 1903 and five years later its address was recorded as 155 [[Recto Avenue|Calle Azc\u00e1rraga]] in [[Tondo, Manila]].  About a decade later its address was Calle Ilaya (now Ilaya Street) and Calle Azc\u00e1rraga in Tondo.\n\n=== Santa Ana Cabaret ===\nThis twentieth-century [[nightclub]] ([http://www.cnac.org/emilscott/canson_chickese01.htm photos]), owned by an American named John Canson, was once advertised as being the largest [[cabaret]] in the world. It opened in Tejeros in 1921 and was in business until 1970, when a [[Typhoon Patsy (1970)|typhoon]] destroyed it. Famous patrons included President [[Manuel Quezon]], [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Francis Burton Harrison|Francis Harrison]], and General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. It is also said that [[Edward VIII|Edward]], [[Prince of Wales]] once visited it. During World War II it was converted into a garment factory, producing shirts and military uniforms for the Japanese. After the Americans returned to Makati in February 1945, they converted their famous dance hall into a temporary medical facility. It was the forerunner of fashionable discos of the eighties and nineties, such as Manila's classy Stargazer, as well as Makati's Euphoria, Faces, and Mars.  Its modern counterpart is the Valkyrie Nightclub in Taguig.\n\n===Santa Ana Racetrack===\nOpened in 1937 by the Philippine Racing Club, it was the first notable [[sport venue]] of Makati, and was the forerunner of other famous Makati sport venues where international competitions were held such as the Manila Golf Club, which located in Makati in 1948, the Manila Polo Club, which relocated to Makati in 1950, and the defunct [[QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup|Astrobowl Magallanes]].  It was larger than the San Lazaro Racetrack in [[Santa Cruz, Manila]].\n \nDuring World War II it became a military storage area, and as a consequence was targeted by aerial bombardment toward the end of the war. On 9 February 1945, it was at the Philippine Racing Club grounds that the Americans, advancing from Wack Wack golf club ([http://www.silverlensgalleries.com/artist.php?teodulo-protomartir=155 photo no. 26a]) and crossing the Pasig River using [[amtrac]]s, returned to Makati. Afterward, they built a [[pontoon bridge]] ([http://battlingbastardsbataan.com/james.htm seventh photo]) which was one of two such temporary bridges they had to build after the last remaining bridges spanning the Pasig River\u2014Banzai (Jones) and Santa Cruz (MacArthur)\u2014were blown on 5 February. This pontoon bridge was damaged and knocked out by artillery fire on 10 and 11 February and was reported as having been repaired ([http://www.ww2online.org/image/philippine-refugees-stream-across-pontoon-bridge-spanning-upper-pasig-river-manila-26-february photo]). The Art-deco buildings of the racetrack were later used as a headquarters by US General MacArthur and also by [[Allied Translator and Interpreter Section|Allied translators and interpreters]].\n\nHorse racing resumed during the postcolonial period. Toward the end of the twentieth century, an increase in the taxation of winnings combined with a rise in the ownership of TV sets led to a decline in attendance, which resulted in the closure of the racetrack in December 2008 and its demolition in 2013.\n\n===Santiago Hospital===\nThe Santiago Hospital was a twentieth-century [[Health facility|medical facility]] in Poblaci\u00f3n. Originally named ''Hospital Espa\u00f1ol de Santiago'', it was founded in 1902 in Manila by the Spanish community as an infectious hospital for the hospitalization of Spaniards who, having to comply with sanitary regulations concerning compulsory hospitalization, preferred the services of this hospital rather than those of the public San Lazaro Hospital.  Its earliest known address was 1819 [[List of renamed streets in Metro Manila|Calle Azc\u00e1rraga]], Quiapo. In 1929, the hospital moved into its own building, an Art-deco structure in Makati, and at the beginning of the thirties was one of two hospitals in Rizal Province. By 1935, this medical facility, which had thirty-four beds, was classified as a general hospital which treated all sorts of diseases except those requiring compulsory segregation in government institutions, and by that time was admitting patients of nationalities other than Spanish.\n\nDuring World War II, Santiago Hospital was administered by the [[Sisters of Charity of St. Paul|Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres]], and in February 1945 it had the distinction of being the only hospital in the Greater Manila area which remained open throughout the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]].  Santiago Hospital, which was once considered to be one of the best hospitals in the Philippines, closed in the 1960s as a result of the increasing urbanization of Makati.\n\nAlthough generally believed to be Makati's first hospital, it was preceded by a hospital in Guadalupe which existed during the [[First Philippine Republic|First Republic]].  Also over a decade earlier in 1884, the Spanish briefly operated in Guadalupe an orphanage, a type of institution which in their point of view was a medical facility.  In 1917, the Americans also opened an orphanage in Makati, at Casa Quinta.\n\n==Culture and sports==\n[[File:Ayala Museum.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Ayala Museum]]]]\nMakati is home to a number of fine art museums, colonial-era churches and recreation areas.

It is available as a standard [[panel van]] for cargo (called Vito), or with passenger accommodations substituted for part or all of the load area (called '''V-Class''' or '''Viano''').\n\nThe V-Class/Viano is a [[Minivan|large MPV]]. The first generation went on sale in 1996. The second generation was introduced in 2004, and the vehicle received the new Viano name. In 2010, the vehicle was facelifted with revised front and rear bumpers and lights. The interior was also improved with upgraded materials and new technology. The third generation was launched in 2014 and returned to being called V-Class.\n\nThe Viano is available in both rear- and four-wheel-drive configurations and comes in three lengths, two wheelbases and a choice of four petrol and diesel engines (as well as two specialist tuned models) coupled to either a six-speed manual or five-speed [[Tiptronic|TouchShift]] automatic transmission.\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{Anchor|W638}}First generation (W638; 1996\u20132003)==\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz V 220 CDI Trend (W 638) \u2013 Frontansicht, 12.

August 2013, Velbert.jpg|thumb|Mercedes-Benz V-Klasse (rear)]]\n\nThe first generation [[Mercedes-Benz]] Vito was produced between 1996 and 2003. It is powered either by a diesel engine with up to {{convert|120|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} or a gasoline engine with up to {{convert|140|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and a [[front-wheel drive]] drivetrain. The range of gasoline engines consists of two old units from Mercedes (113 and 114) and a [[Volkswagen]] 2.8 VR6 engine, designated as the M104.900. When it comes to diesel engines, old 2.3 with and without turbo and also modern CDI 2.2 engines are available.\n\nThis body design was also sold as the V-Klasse in more luxurious and expensive version (V-Klasse was replaced with the Viano-name for the second generation of Vito). The Viano also included less van like features to the Vito such as only two seats in the front and a larger and more spacious seating capacity. At first many Vito drivers who wanted a spacious, small van opted for the Vito microbus which was extremely similar to the Viano, apart from its more van like and less luxurious features. The Viano was however a good, more car like option to the Vito microbus.  It was designed by Michael Mauer from 1989 to 1991, when the final design was chosen and patented in February 1993.<ref>[http://press.porsche.com/more_about/executives/pag/mauer.php \"Mercedes-Benz Vito\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202081500/http://press.porsche.com/more_about/executives/pag/mauer.php |date=2 February 2017 }}.

In normal operation the system transfers driving power in a 35:65 split between the front and rear axles. The 4MATIC system does not have mechanical differential locks, but an electronic traction system (4ETS). If one or more wheels loses traction on a slippery surface, the system applies brief pulses of brake pressure to the spinning wheels thus increasing torque to wheels with good grip. Vehicles with four-wheel drive have a higher ride height, which increases approach, departure and breakover angles (20\u00b0/28\u00b0/19\u00b0 respectively, versus 14\u00b0/22\u00b0/14\u00b0 in conventional rear-wheel-drive models).

It will be fabricated by [[Mercedes-Benz]] Spain, in the factory of [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]]. The first manufactured units (91 already) were presented on 7 February 2011. The goal is to produce 474 units by the end of the year. Most of them will be sold to foreign companies (mainly in Germany; [[Berlin]] and [[Stuttgart]]), though the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] supermarket gamble [[Eroski]] has got four vans for distribution duties. Last year, the government made a plan in order to encourage this kind of cars. 590 million \u20ac will be funded, from which 7 have gone to the 'E-Cell' project. This project will also be supported by the Basque and German governments.\n\nMercedes-Benz has chosen its Spanish factory in Vitoria for fabricating exclusively this van, which will substitute the current models Vito and Viano (the commercial-transport and passenger-carrier versions, respectively). Mercedes-Benz expected 100 vehicles to be produced by the end of 2010 and a further 2,000 by the end of 2011.<ref>{{cite web |last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/07/30/mercedes-benz-introduces-new-vito-e-cell-van/ |title=Mercedes-Benz introduces new Vito E-Cell van \u2013 Autoblog Green |publisher=Green.autoblog.com |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Vito E-Cell utilizes a front-wheel drive setup to save installation space for a 36-[[kWh]] [[lithium-ion battery]] pack housed underneath the van's cargo area. The E-Cell's [[electric motor]] has {{convert|60|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|280|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

With this aim of saving space, only the front-drive version is offered, unlike in the previous model, so a long development was needed, although some suspension components of the AWD ([[all-wheel drive]]) version were used. The vehicle has a payload capacity of {{convert|900|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and a permissible total weight of three tons (3.050&nbsp;kg, exactly). <br />\nThe car does not show external changes with the other versions (except for the decoration): the body has not been modified, both the double side door and the helpful back 'gate' remain as before. The place for the refueling has also been used for the recharging connection.\n\nThe Vito E-Cell has got a complete and modern equipment. Among the main novelties, this model has a special [[heater]] connected to the high voltage network and to the basic heating system, in order to ensure pleasant conditions even in the coldest months.\n\nIn terms of safety, the new Mercedes keeps the same level as the other Vito models. The vehicle has an [[internal combustion engine]], so, if a collision occurs, the batteries are protected by a shock element. The active safety also makes that the high-technology voltage network turns off when the airbag control unit activates. The Vito E-Cell comes standard with the [[Electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Program]] (ESP) and dual [[airbag]]s.\n\nThis van is driven by an [[electric battery]]. This battery is placed under the chassis (where the [[petrol tank]] and the [[prop-shaft]] are normally), while the engine, the transformer and the charger are located in the engine's (a block of four or six cylinders) usual position, under the hood.\n\nThe battery consists of a [[Lithium ion battery]] pack split into 16 modules with 192 cells in all, with high energy density and a rated voltage of 360 volts. They are supplied by the company [[Magna International|Magna]], and they have a maximum range of {{convert|130|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (just as the engine), but this can be reduced by the weather conditions, the ground's topography or even the cargo volume.  It is considered that a range between 90&nbsp;km and 100&nbsp;km could be more realistic.  Either way, it is supposed to be enough for a workday in urban delivery. The batteries weigh {{convert|550|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}; their life is unknown. Their total charge time is six hours through a high voltage system (380 or 400 volts); with a domestic 230 volt supply the total charge time is double, about 12 hours. The total battery capacity is 36&nbsp;kWh, 32&nbsp;kWh are available for the vehicle operation. Moreover, Mercedes-Benz offers the vehicle in the form of 'renting', in which the manufacturer takes charge of updating the batteries when necessary.\n\nThe electric engine is a permanent synchronous magnet drive with a constant power of {{convert|60|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} and a maximum power of {{convert|70|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}}. The top speed is limited to {{convert|80|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, and it has a maximum [[torque]] of {{convert|280|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} instantly available, which lets the van have a similar dynamic performance to one equipped with a modern diesel engine.\n\n====Engines====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Petrol engines<ref name=EandD>{{Cite web

It is available as a standard [[panel van]] for cargo (called Vito), or with passenger accommodations substituted for part or all of the load area (called '''V-Class''' or '''Viano''').\n\nThe V-Class/Viano is a [[Minivan|large MPV]]. The first generation went on sale in 1996. The second generation was introduced in 2004, and the vehicle received the new Viano name. In 2010, the vehicle was facelifted with revised front and rear bumpers and lights. The interior was also improved with upgraded materials and new technology. The third generation was launched in 2014 and returned to being called V-Class.\n\nThe Viano is available in both rear- and four-wheel-drive configurations and comes in three lengths, two wheelbases and a choice of four petrol and diesel engines (as well as two specialist tuned models) coupled to either a six-speed manual or five-speed [[Tiptronic|TouchShift]] automatic transmission.\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{Anchor|W638}}First generation (W638; 1996\u20132003)==\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz V 220 CDI Trend (W 638) \u2013 Frontansicht, 12.

August 2013, Velbert.jpg|thumb|Mercedes-Benz V-Klasse (rear)]]\n\nThe first generation [[Mercedes-Benz]] Vito was produced between 1996 and 2003. It is powered either by a diesel engine with up to {{convert|120|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} or a gasoline engine with up to {{convert|140|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and a [[front-wheel drive]] drivetrain. The range of gasoline engines consists of two old units from Mercedes (113 and 114) and a [[Volkswagen]] 2.8 VR6 engine, designated as the M104.900. When it comes to diesel engines, old 2.3 with and without turbo and also modern CDI 2.2 engines are available.\n\nThis body design was also sold as the V-Klasse in more luxurious and expensive version (V-Klasse was replaced with the Viano-name for the second generation of Vito). The Viano also included less van like features to the Vito such as only two seats in the front and a larger and more spacious seating capacity. At first many Vito drivers who wanted a spacious, small van opted for the Vito microbus which was extremely similar to the Viano, apart from its more van like and less luxurious features. The Viano was however a good, more car like option to the Vito microbus.  It was designed by Michael Mauer from 1989 to 1991, when the final design was chosen and patented in February 1993.<ref>[http://press.porsche.com/more_about/executives/pag/mauer.php \"Mercedes-Benz Vito\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202081500/http://press.porsche.com/more_about/executives/pag/mauer.php |date=2 February 2017 }}.

This system is only possible when the vehicle is traveling at less than {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and if the vehicle goes over this speed while the LSM is active, it is deactivated, and the wheels straighten up.\n\nIt is longer and wider than the TX models, but traveling through tight spaces is aided by the electric folding wing mirrors, which as of 2009 are standard.\n\n====Viano Marco Polo====\n[[File:Vianomarcopolo1.png|thumb|Viano Marco Polo camping edition]]\n\nIn some countries a camping derivative is available - known as the Marco Polo - equipped with a galley (including gas stove, sink, 40 L fridge, and storage), multi-function wardrobe and a sliding bench seat in the rear which can be turned into a large air-sprung bed. A pop-up roof is also standard (electric assist is optional) providing standing height inside. An additional bed can be fitted in the pop-up roof area to increase sleeping capacity to four individuals. Fresh water and waste water tanks are accessible from outside the vehicle, while the gas-cylinder bay is hidden inside an interior cupboard. An auxiliary battery is included under the front passenger seat. Up to six optional individual seats can be fitted for maximum MPV flexibility, but only four seats (including the two-seater bench mentioned above) can be used when in camping mode.\n\nThe Marco Polo was designed and created in partnership with [[Westfalia]] just like Volkswagen camper vans were until 1999.

In normal operation the system transfers driving power in a 35:65 split between the front and rear axles. The 4MATIC system does not have mechanical differential locks, but an electronic traction system (4ETS). If one or more wheels loses traction on a slippery surface, the system applies brief pulses of brake pressure to the spinning wheels thus increasing torque to wheels with good grip. Vehicles with four-wheel drive have a higher ride height, which increases approach, departure and breakover angles (20\u00b0/28\u00b0/19\u00b0 respectively, versus 14\u00b0/22\u00b0/14\u00b0 in conventional rear-wheel-drive models).

It will be fabricated by [[Mercedes-Benz]] Spain, in the factory of [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]]. The first manufactured units (91 already) were presented on 7 February 2011. The goal is to produce 474 units by the end of the year. Most of them will be sold to foreign companies (mainly in Germany; [[Berlin]] and [[Stuttgart]]), though the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] supermarket gamble [[Eroski]] has got four vans for distribution duties. Last year, the government made a plan in order to encourage this kind of cars. 590 million \u20ac will be funded, from which 7 have gone to the 'E-Cell' project. This project will also be supported by the Basque and German governments.\n\nMercedes-Benz has chosen its Spanish factory in Vitoria for fabricating exclusively this van, which will substitute the current models Vito and Viano (the commercial-transport and passenger-carrier versions, respectively). Mercedes-Benz expected 100 vehicles to be produced by the end of 2010 and a further 2,000 by the end of 2011.<ref>{{cite web |last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/07/30/mercedes-benz-introduces-new-vito-e-cell-van/ |title=Mercedes-Benz introduces new Vito E-Cell van \u2013 Autoblog Green |publisher=Green.autoblog.com |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Vito E-Cell utilizes a front-wheel drive setup to save installation space for a 36-[[kWh]] [[lithium-ion battery]] pack housed underneath the van's cargo area. The E-Cell's [[electric motor]] has {{convert|60|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|280|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

With this aim of saving space, only the front-drive version is offered, unlike in the previous model, so a long development was needed, although some suspension components of the AWD ([[all-wheel drive]]) version were used. The vehicle has a payload capacity of {{convert|900|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and a permissible total weight of three tons (3.050&nbsp;kg, exactly). <br />\nThe car does not show external changes with the other versions (except for the decoration): the body has not been modified, both the double side door and the helpful back 'gate' remain as before. The place for the refueling has also been used for the recharging connection.\n\nThe Vito E-Cell has got a complete and modern equipment. Among the main novelties, this model has a special [[heater]] connected to the high voltage network and to the basic heating system, in order to ensure pleasant conditions even in the coldest months.\n\nIn terms of safety, the new Mercedes keeps the same level as the other Vito models. The vehicle has an [[internal combustion engine]], so, if a collision occurs, the batteries are protected by a shock element. The active safety also makes that the high-technology voltage network turns off when the airbag control unit activates. The Vito E-Cell comes standard with the [[Electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Program]] (ESP) and dual [[airbag]]s.\n\nThis van is driven by an [[electric battery]]. This battery is placed under the chassis (where the [[petrol tank]] and the [[prop-shaft]] are normally), while the engine, the transformer and the charger are located in the engine's (a block of four or six cylinders) usual position, under the hood.\n\nThe battery consists of a [[Lithium ion battery]] pack split into 16 modules with 192 cells in all, with high energy density and a rated voltage of 360 volts. They are supplied by the company [[Magna International|Magna]], and they have a maximum range of {{convert|130|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (just as the engine), but this can be reduced by the weather conditions, the ground's topography or even the cargo volume.  It is considered that a range between 90&nbsp;km and 100&nbsp;km could be more realistic.  Either way, it is supposed to be enough for a workday in urban delivery. The batteries weigh {{convert|550|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}; their life is unknown. Their total charge time is six hours through a high voltage system (380 or 400 volts); with a domestic 230 volt supply the total charge time is double, about 12 hours. The total battery capacity is 36&nbsp;kWh, 32&nbsp;kWh are available for the vehicle operation. Moreover, Mercedes-Benz offers the vehicle in the form of 'renting', in which the manufacturer takes charge of updating the batteries when necessary.\n\nThe electric engine is a permanent synchronous magnet drive with a constant power of {{convert|60|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} and a maximum power of {{convert|70|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}}. The top speed is limited to {{convert|80|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, and it has a maximum [[torque]] of {{convert|280|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} instantly available, which lets the van have a similar dynamic performance to one equipped with a modern diesel engine.\n\n====Engines====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Petrol engines<ref name=EandD>{{Cite web

''Dukkha'' is seen to arise from craving, and putting an end to craving can lead to liberation ([[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]]). The way to put an end to craving is by following the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] taught by the Buddha, which includes the ethical elements of right speech, right action and right livelihood. From the point of view of the Four Noble Truths, an action is seen as ethical if it is conductive to the elimination of ''dukkha''. Understanding the truth of ''dukkha'' in life allows one to analyze the factors for its arising, that is craving, and allows us to feel compassion and sympathy for others. Comparing oneself with others and then applying the [[Golden Rule]] is said to follow from this appreciation of ''dukkha''.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000</ref>  From the Buddhist perspective, an act is also moral if it promotes spiritual development by conforming to the Eightfold Path and leading to Nirvana. In Mahayana Buddhism, an emphasis is made on the liberation of all beings and ''[[bodhisattvas]]'' are believed to work tirelessly for the liberation of all.\n\n=== Precepts ===\n[[File:Dennis Genpo Merzel Jukai (Shasui).jpg|thumb|right|225px| In the [[Zen Buddhist]] initiation ceremony of [[Buddhist initiation ritual#S\u014dt\u014d school|Jukai]], initiates take up the [[Bodhisattva Precepts]].]]\n{{Main|Five Precepts}}\nThe foundation of Buddhist ethics for laypeople is [[The Five Precepts]] which are common to all Buddhist schools. The precepts or \"five moral virtues\" (''pa\u00f1ca-silani'') are not commands but a set of voluntary commitments or guidelines,{{sfn|Keown |2003 |page=268 }} to help one live a life in which one is happy, without worries, and able to meditate well. The precepts are supposed to prevent suffering and to weaken the effects of greed, hatred and delusion. They were the basic moral instructions which the Buddha gave to laypeople and monks alike.  Breaking one's s\u012bla as pertains to sexual conduct introduces harmfulness towards one's practice or the practice of another person if it involves uncommitted relationship.<ref name=\"Peter Harvey 2001, pages 195-196\">Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.''

The three additional rules of the Eight Precepts are:<ref name=\"bodhimonastery\" />\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\u201cI accept the training rule to abstain from food at improper times.\u201d (e.g. no solid foods after noon, and not until dawn the following day)</li>\n<li>\u201cI accept the training rule (a) to abstain from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and shows, and (b) from the use of jewelry, cosmetics, and beauty lotions.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cI accept the training rule to abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds and seats.\u201d</li>\n</ol>\n\n[[Samanera|Novice-monks]] use the [[Ten Precepts (Buddhism)|ten precepts]] while fully ordained Buddhist monks also have a larger set of monastic precepts, called the [[Pr\u0101timok\u1e63a]] (227 rules for monks in the Therav\u0101din recension). Monks are supposed to be celibate and are also traditionally not allowed to touch money. The rules and code of conduct for monks and nuns is outlined in the [[Vinaya]]. The precise content of the [[vinayapitaka|scriptures on ''vinaya'']] (''vinayapi\u1e6daka'') differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to the ''vinaya''.\n\nIn [[Mahayana Buddhism]], another common set of moral guidelines are the [[Bodhisattva vows]] and the [[Bodhisattva Precepts]] or the \"Ten Great Precepts\". The Bodhisattva Precepts which is derived from the Mahayana [[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahmajala Sutra]] include the Five precepts with some other additions such as the precept against slandering the Buddha's teachings. These exist above and beyond the existing monastic code, or lay follower precepts.<ref name=\"bodiford\">{{cite book | last = Bodiford | first = William M. | authorlink=William Bodiford|title = Soto Zen in Medieval Japan (Studies in East Asian Buddhism) | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-8248-3303-9 | pages=22\u201336}}</ref> The Brahmajala Sutra also includes a list of 48 minor precepts which prohibit the eating of meat, storing of weapons, teaching for the sake of profit, abandoning Mahayana teachings and teaching non Mahayana Dharma.

The community of monastics is seen as the most meritorious field of karmic fruitfulness.]]\n{{Buddhist Philosophy sidebar}}\nFollowing the precepts is not the only dimension of Buddhist morality, there are also several important virtues, motivations and habits which are widely promoted by Buddhist texts and traditions. At the core of these virtues are the three roots of non-attachment (araga), benevolence (advesa), and understanding (amoha).\n\nOne list of virtues which is widely promoted in Buddhism are the [[P\u0101ramit\u0101]]s (perfections) \u2013 [[D\u0101na]] (generosity), [[\u015a\u012bla|S\u012bla]] (proper conduct), [[Nekkhamma]] (renunciation), [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101]] (wisdom), [[V\u012brya|Viriya]] (energy), [[Kshanti|Khanti]] (patience), [[Sacca]] (honesty), [[Adhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na]] (determination), [[Mett\u0101]] (Good-Will), [[Upekkha|Upekkh\u0101]] (equanimity).\n\nThe Four divine abidings ([[Brahmaviharas]]) are seen as central virtues and intentions in Buddhist ethics, psychology and meditation. The four divine abidings are [[metta|good will]], [[Karu\u1e47\u0101|compassion]], [[Mudita|empathetic joy]], and [[Upekkha|equanimity]]. Developing these virtues through meditation and right action promotes happiness, generates good merit and trains the mind for ethical action.\n\nAn important quality which supports right action is Heedfulness ([[Appamada]]), a combination of energy/effort ([[Viriya]]) and Mindfulness. [[Mindfulness]] is an alert presence of mind which allows one to be more aware of what is happening with one's intentional states. Heedfulness is aided by 'clear comprehension' or 'discrimination' ([[Sampaja\u00f1\u00f1a]]), which gives rise to moral knowledge of what is to be done. Another important supporting quality of Buddhist morality is [[Faith in Buddhism|Trust or Confidence]] in the teachings of the Buddha and in one's own ability to put them into practice. [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|Wisdom]] and Understanding are seen as a prerequisite for acting morally. Having an understanding of the true nature of reality is seen as leading to ethical actions. Understanding the truth of [[Anatta|not-self]] for example, allows one to become detached from selfish motivations and therefore allows one to be more altruistic. Having an understanding of the workings of the mind and of the law of karma also makes one less likely to perform an unethical action.\n\nThe Buddha promoted \u2018self-respect\u2019 ([[Hri (Buddhism)|Hri]]) and Regard for consequences ([[Apatrapya]]), as important virtues. Self-respect is what caused a person to avoid actions which were seen to harm one's integrity and Ottappa is an awareness of the effects of one's actions and sense of embarrassment before others.\n\nGiving ([[D\u0101na]]) is seen as the beginning of virtue in Theravada Buddhism and as the basis for developing further on the path. In Buddhist countries, this is seen in the giving of alms to Buddhist monastics but also extends to generosity in general (towards family, friends, coworkers, guests, animals).<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 62.</ref> Giving is said to make one happy, generate good merit as well as develop non-attachment, therefore it is not just good because it creates good karmic fruits, but it also develops one's spiritual qualities. In Buddhist thought, the cultivation of [[Dana (Buddhism)|dana]] and ethical conduct will themselves refine consciousness to such a level that rebirth in one of the lower hells is unlikely, even if there is no further Buddhist practice. There is nothing improper or un-Buddhist about limiting one's aims to this level of attainment.<ref name=\"Peter Harvey 2001, pages 195-196\" />\n\nAn important value in Buddhist ethics is non-harming or non-violence ([[ahimsa]]) to all living creatures from the lowest insect to humans which is associated with the first precept of not killing. The Buddhist practice of this does not extend to the extremes exhibited by [[Jainism]] (in Buddhism, unintentional killing is not karmically bad), but from both the Buddhist and Jain perspectives, non-violence suggests an intimate involvement with, and relationship to, all living things.<ref>Carl Olson, ''The Different Paths of Buddhism'' p.73</ref>\n\nThe Buddha also emphasized that \u2018good friendship ([[Kaly\u0101\u1e47a-mittat\u0101]]), good association, good intimacy\u2019 was the whole, not the half of the holy life ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 45.2). Developing strong friendships with good people on the spiritual path is seen as a key aspect of Buddhism and as a key way to support and grow in one's practice.\n\nIn [[Mahayana Buddhism]], another important foundation for moral action is the [[Bodhisattva]] ideal. Bodhisattvas are beings which have chosen to work towards the salvation of all living beings. In Mahayana Buddhist texts, this path of great compassion is promoted as being superior to that of the [[Arhat]] because the Bodhisattva is seen as working for the benefit of all beings.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 130.</ref> A Bodhisattva is one who arouses a powerful emotion called [[Bodhicitta]] (mind of enlightenment) which is a mind which is oriented towards the awakening of oneself and all beings.\n\n== Issues ==\n\n=== Killing ===\n[[File:Saito Musashi-bo Benkei - tales of the wars of the Gempei, being the story of the lives and adventures of Iyo-no-Kami Minamoto Kuro Yoshitsune and Saito Musashi-bo Benkei the warrior monk (1910) (14780268451).jpg|thumb|200px|Japanese illustration of Iyo-no-Kami Minamoto Kuro Yoshitsune and [[Benkei|Saito Musashi-bo Benkei]], the Buddhist [[Sohei|warrior monk]].]]\n\nThe first precept is the abstaining from the taking of life, and the Buddha clearly stated that the taking of human or animal life would lead to negative karmic consequences and was non conductive to liberation. Right livelihood includes not trading in weapons or in hunting and butchering animals. Various suttas state that one should always have a mind filled with compassion and loving kindness for all beings, this is to be extended to hurtful, evil people as in the case of [[Angulimala]] the murderer and to every kind of animal, even pests and vermin (monks are not allowed to kill any animal, for any reason). Buddhist teachings and institutions therefore tend to promote peace and compassion, acting as safe havens during times of conflict.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 239.</ref> In spite of this, some Buddhists, including monastics such as Japanese [[Sohei|warrior monks]] have historically performed acts of violence. In China, the [[Shaolin Monastery]] developed a [[martial arts]] tradition to defend themselves from attack.\n\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, the concept of skillful means ([[upaya]]) has in some circumstances been used to excuse the act of killing, if it is being done for compassionate reasons. This form of \"compassionate killing\" is allowed by the ''Upaya-kausalya sutra'' and the ''Maha-Upaya-kausalya sutra'' only when it \"follows from virtuous thought.\"<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 135.</ref> Some texts acknowledge the negative karmic consequences of killing, and yet promote it out of compassion. The ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Bodhisattva-bhumi]]'', a key Mahayana text, states that if a Bodhisattva sees someone about to kill other Bodhisattvas, they may take it upon themselves to kill this murderer with the thought that:\n\n\"If I take the life of this sentient being, I myself may be reborn as one of the creatures of hell. Better that I be reborn a creature of hell than that this living being, having committed a deed of immediate retribution, should go straight to hell.\"<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 137.</ref>\n\nIf then, the intention is purely to protect others from evil, the act of killing is sometimes seen as meritorious.\n\n==== War ====\n{{Main|Ahimsa#Buddhism}}\n{{See also|Criticism of Buddhism#War and violence}}\n[[File:Museum of Ethnology Vienna 002.JPG|thumb|220px|Statue portrait of [[5th Dalai Lama]].]]\nThe Buddhist analysis of conflict begins with the '[[Three poisons (Buddhism)|Three Poisons]]' of greed, hatred and delusion. Craving and attachment, the cause of suffering, is also the cause of conflict. Buddhist philosopher [[Shantideva]] states in his ''Siksasamuccaya'': \"Wherever conflict arises among living creatures, the sense of possession is the cause\". Craving for material resources as well as grasping to political or religious views is seen as a major source of war. One's attachment to self-identity, and identification with tribe, nation state or religion is also another root of human conflict according to Buddhism.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 240.</ref>\n\nThe Buddha promoted [[non-violence]] in various ways, he encouraged his followers not to fight in wars and not to sell or trade weapons. The Buddha stated that in war, both victor and defeated suffer: \"The victor begets enmity. The vanquished dwells in sorrow. The tranquil lives happily, abandoning both victory and defeat\" ([[Dhammapada]], 201). Buddhist philosopher [[Candrak\u012brti]] wrote that soldiery was not a respectable profession: \"the sacrifice of life in battle should not be respected, since this is the basis for harmful actions.\"<ref name=Goodman>Goodman, Charles, \"Ethics in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/ethics-indian-buddhism/>{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref> The [[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra]] states that those who take the [[Bodhisattva vows]] should not take any part in war, watch a battle, procure or store weapons, praise or approve of killers and aid the killing of others in any way. In his [[Abhidharma-kosa]], [[Vasubandhu]] writes that all soldiers in an army are guilty of the killing of the army, not just those who perform the actual killing.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 254.</ref> Modern Buddhist peace activists include The [[14th Dalai Lama]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Sulak Sivaraksa]], [[A. T. Ariyaratne]], [[Preah Maha Ghosananda]] and [[Nichidatsu Fujii]].\n\nWhile [[pacifism]] is the Buddhist ideal, Buddhist states and kingdoms have waged war throughout history and Buddhists have found ways to justify these conflicts. The [[5th Dalai Lama]] who was installed as the head of Buddhism in Tibet by [[Gushri Khan]] after the [[Khoshut Khanate|Oirat invasion of Tibet]] (1635\u20131642), praised the acts of the Khan and said that he was an emanation of the great Bodhisattva [[Vajrapani]].<ref name=Goodman /> Under the fifth Dalai Lama and the powerful Gelug Regent Sonam Chophel (1595\u20131657), treasurer of the Ganden Palace, the Tibetan kingdom launched invasions of [[Bhutan]] (c. 1647, ending in failure) and [[Ladakh]] (c. 1679, which regained previously lost Tibetan territory) with Mongol aid.<ref>Samten G. Karmay, The Great Fifth, IIAS Newsletter #39 December 2005, https://iias.asia/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL39_1213.pdf</ref>\n\nAnother example is that of Buddhist [[Sohei|warrior monks]] in [[feudal Japan]] who sometimes committed organized acts of war, protecting their territories and attacking rival Buddhist sects. During the late [[Heian Period]], the [[Tendai]] school was a particularly powerful sect, whose influential monasteries could wield armies of monks. A key text of this sect was the [[Mah\u0101y\u0101na Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47a S\u016btra]], which contains passages allowing the use of violence for the defense of the Dharma.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 265.</ref> The [[Ashikaga period]] saw military conflict between the Tendai school, [[J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b]] school and the [[Nichiren]] Buddhists. [[Zen Buddhism]] was influential among the [[samurai]], and their [[Bushido]] code.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] almost all [[Japanese Buddhism|Japanese Buddhists temples]] (except the [[Soka Gakkai]]) strongly supported Japanese imperialism and militarization.<ref>Gier, Nicholas, F.

The [[Jataka]] stories contain tales of women who perform abortions being reborn in a [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell]]. In the case where the mother's life is in jeopardy, many traditional Buddhists agree that abortion is permissible.

The [[Dalai Lama]] has said that abortion is \"negative,\" but there are exceptions.  He said, \"I think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance.\"<ref name=\"Dreifus\">{{cite news |author=[[Claudia Dreifus]] |title=The Dalai Lama |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/magazine/the-dalai-lama.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 28, 1993 |accessdate=July 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nWhile abortion is problematic in Buddhism, contraception is generally a non-issue.\n\n==== Suicide and euthanasia ====\n{{Main|Buddhism and euthanasia}}\n[[File:Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c self-immolation.jpg|250px|thumb|Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's self-immolation during the [[Buddhist crisis]]]]\nBuddhism understands life as being pervaded by [[Dukkha]], as unsatisfactory and stressful. Ending one's life to escape present suffering is seen as futile because one will just be reborn again, and again. One of the three forms of craving is craving for annihilation ([[Ta\u1e47h\u0101#Vibhava-tanha (craving not to be)|vibhava tanha]]), and this form of craving is the root of future suffering. Dying with an unwholesome and agitated state of mind is seen as leading to a bad rebirth, so [[suicide]] is seen as creating negative karma.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 287.</ref> Ending one's life is also seen as throwing away the precious opportunity to generate positive karma. While suicide does not seem to be interpreted as a breaking of the first precept (not killing other beings) it is still seen as a grave and unwholesome action.<ref name=\"Peter Harvey 2000, page 288\">Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 288.</ref>\n\nIn [[Theravada Buddhism]], for a monk to praise the advantages of death, including simply telling a person of the miseries of life or the bliss of dying and going to heaven in such a way that he/she might feel inspired to commit suicide or simply pine away to death, is explicitly stated as a breach in one of highest vinaya codes regarding the prohibition of harming life, hence it will result in automatic expulsion from [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].<ref>Pruitt & Norman, ''The Patimokkha'', 2001, Pali Text Society, Lancaster, Defeat 3</ref>\n\nBuddhism sees the experience of dying as a very sensitive moment in one's spiritual life, because the quality of one's mind at the time of death is believed to condition one's future rebirth.<ref name=\"Peter Harvey 2000, page 288\" /> The Buddhist ideal is to die in a calm but conscious state, while learning to let go. Dying consciously, without negative thoughts but rather joyously with good thoughts in mind is seen as a good transition into the next life. Chanting and reciting Buddhist texts is a common practice; in Tibet the [[Bardo Thodol]] is used to guide the dying to a good rebirth.<ref name=\"Peter Harvey 2000, page 288\" />\n\nTraditional Buddhism would hold [[Euthanasia]], where one brings about the death of a suffering patient (whether or not they desire this) so as to prevent further pain, as a breach of the first precept.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 295.</ref> The argument that such a killing is an act of compassion because it prevents suffering is unacceptable to traditional Buddhist theology because it is seen to be deeply rooted in delusion. This is because the suffering being who was euthanized would just end up being reborn and having to suffer due to their karma (even though not all suffering is due to karma), and hence killing them does not help them escape suffering.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 296.</ref> The [[Abhidharma-kosa]] clearly states that the killing of one's sick and aged parents is an act of delusion. The act of killing someone in the process of death also ruins their chance to mindfully experience pain and learn to let go of the body, hence desire for euthanasia would be a form of aversion to physical pain and a craving for non-becoming. According to [[Kalu Rinpoche]] however, choosing to be removed from life support is karmically neutral.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 301.</ref> The choice not to receive medical treatment when one is terminally ill is then not seen as morally reprehensible, as long as it does not arise from a feeling of aversion to life. This would also apply to not resuscitating a terminal patient.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to the injunction against suicide. Several Pali suttas contain stories where self-euthanizing is not seen as unethical by the Buddha, showing that the issue is more complex. These exceptions, such as the story of the monk Channa and that of the monk Vakkali, typically deal with advanced Buddhist practitioners. In these exceptional cases, both Channa and Vakkali are both said to be enlightened [[arhats]] and euthanized themselves in a calm and detached state of mind.<ref>At wood, Michael. Suicide as A Response to Suffering. http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol4/suicide_as_a_response_to_suffering.html</ref>\n\nIn East-Asian and Tibetan Buddhism, the practice of [[Self-immolation]] developed. In China, the first recorded self-immolation was by the monk Fayu (d. 396).<ref>Benn, James A.

However, capital punishment has been used in most historically Buddhist states. The first of the [[Five Precepts]] (Panca-sila) is to abstain from destruction of life. Chapter 10 of the [[Dhammapada]] states:\n\n:''\"Everyone fears punishment; everyone fears death, just as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill. Everyone fears punishment; everyone loves life, as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill''\".\n\nChapter 26, the final chapter of the Dhammapada, states \"Him I call a [[brahmin]] who has put aside weapons and renounced violence toward all creatures. He neither kills nor helps others to kill\". These sentences are interpreted by many Buddhists (especially in the West) as an injunction against supporting any legal measure which might lead to the death penalty. However, almost throughout history, countries where Buddhism has been the official religion (which have included most of the [[Far East]] and [[Indochina]]) have practiced the death penalty. One exception is the abolition of the death penalty by the [[Emperor Saga]] of [[Japan]] in 818. This lasted until 1165, although in private manors executions conducted as a form of retaliation continued to be performed.\n\n=== Animals and the environment ===\n{{Main|Animals in Buddhism}}\n[[File:Buddha Worshipped in Jungle by Animals - Middle Architrave - Rear Side - East Gateway - Stupa 1 - Sanchi Hill 2013-02-21 4462.JPG|thumb|right|225px|The Buddha, represented by the [[Bodhi tree]], attended by animals, [[Sanchi]] vihara.]]\nBuddhism does not see humans as being in a special moral category over animals or as having any kind of God given dominion over them as [[Christianity]] does.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 150.</ref> Humans are seen as being more able to make moral choices, and this means that they should protect and be kind to animals who are also suffering beings who are living in [[samsara]]. Buddhism also sees humans as part of nature, not as separate from it. [[Thich Naht Hanh]] summarizes the Buddhist view of harmony with nature thus:\n\n<blockquote>We classify other animals and living beings as nature, acting as if we ourselves are not part of it. Then we pose the question \u2018How should we deal with Nature?\u2019 We should deal with nature the way we should deal with ourselves! We should not harm ourselves; we should not harm nature...Human beings and nature are inseparable.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 151.</ref></blockquote>\n\nEarly Buddhist monastics spent a lot of time in the forests, which was seen as an excellent place for meditation and this tradition continues to be practiced by the monks of the [[Thai Forest Tradition]].\n\n==== Vegetarianism ====\n{{Main|Buddhist vegetarianism}}\nThere is a divergence of views within Buddhism on the need for vegetarianism, with some schools of Buddhism rejecting such a claimed need and with most Buddhists in fact eating meat. Many [[Mahayana]] Buddhists \u2013 especially the Chinese and Vietnamese traditions \u2013 strongly oppose meat-eating on [[scriptural]] grounds.<ref>[http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/BuddhismAnimalsVegetarian/BuddhistVegetarian.htm Buddhist Resources on Vegetarianism and Animal Welfare] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911135953/http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/BuddhismAnimalsVegetarian/BuddhistVegetarian.htm |date=September 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe first precept of Buddhism focuses mainly on direct participation in the destruction of life. This is one reason that the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] made a distinction between killing animals and eating meat, and refused to introduce vegetarianism into monastic practice. While early Buddhist texts like the [[Pali Canon]] frown upon hunting, butchering, fishing and 'trading in flesh' (meat or livestock) as professions, they do not ban the act of eating meat. Direct participation also includes ordering or encouraging someone to kill an animal for you.\n\nThe Buddhist king [[Ashoka]] promoted vegetarian diets and attempted to decrease the number of animals killed for food in his kingdom by introducing 'no slaughter days' during the year. He gave up hunting trips, banned the killing of specific animals and decreased the use of meat in the royal household. Ashoka even banned the killing of some vermin or pests. His example was followed by later Sri Lankan kings.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 158.</ref> One of Ashoka's rock edicts states:\n<blockquote>Here (in my domain) no living beings are to be slaughtered or offered in sacrifice...Formerly, in the kitchen of Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, hundreds of thousands of animals were killed every day to make curry. But now with the writing of this Dhamma edict only three creatures, two peacocks and a deer are killed, and the deer not always. And in time, not even these three creatures will be killed.<ref>The Edicts of King Asoka an English rendering by Ven. S.

While Buddhist theory tends to equate killing animals with killing people (and avoids the conclusion that killing can sometimes be ethical, e.g. defense of others), outside of the Chinese and Vietnamese monastic tradition, most Buddhists do eat meat in practice.<ref name=\"Dharma Data: Vegetarianism\">[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/dharmadata/fdd21.htm Dharma Data: Vegetarianism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109235226/http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/dharmadata/fdd21.htm |date=November 9, 2016 }}</ref> There is some controversy surrounding whether or not the Buddha himself died from eating rancid pork.<ref>[http://www.hsuyun.com/vegetarian.html Vegetarianism and Buddhism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305033324/http://www.hsuyun.com/vegetarian.html |date=March 5, 2016 }}</ref> While most Chinese and Vietnamese monastics are vegetarian,<ref name=\"Dharma Data: Vegetarianism\" /> vegetarian Tibetans are rare, due to the harsh Himalayan climate.<ref name=\"Dharma Data: Vegetarianism\" /> Japanese lay people tend to eat meat, but monasteries tend to be vegetarian.<ref name=\"Dharma Data: Vegetarianism\" /> The [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]], after contracting [[Hepatitis B]], was advised by doctors to switch to a high animal-protein diet.<ref>{{cite book| author =Dalai Lama| authorlink =| title =Freedom in exile: the autobiography of the Dalai Lama| publisher =HarperOne| year =1991| location =| pages =[https://archive.org/details/freedominexilea000bsta/page/184 184]\u2013185| url =https://archive.org/details/freedominexilea000bsta| url-access =registration| quote =dalai lama hepatitis.| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-06-098701-4}}</ref> The [[Dalai Lama]] eats vegetarian every second day, so he effectively eats a vegetarian diet for 6 months of the year.<ref>[[Norm Phelps|Phelps, Norm]]. (2004). ''The Great Compassion: Buddhism and Animal Rights''. Lantern Books.</ref> In the West, vegetarianism among Buddhists is also common.\n\nIn the [[P\u0101li|Pali]] version of the [[Tripitaka]], there are number of occasions in which the Buddha ate meat as well as recommending certain types of meat as a cure for medical conditions. On one occasion, a general sent a servant to purchase meat specifically to feed the Buddha. The Buddha declared that:\n{{quote|\nMeat should not be eaten under three circumstances: when it is seen or heard or suspected (that a living being has been purposely slaughtered for the eater); these, [[Jivaka]], are the three circumstances in which meat should not be eaten, Jivaka! I declare there are three circumstances in which meat can be eaten: when it is not seen or heard or suspected (that a living being has been purposely slaughtered for the eater); Jivaka, I say these are the three circumstances in which meat can be eaten.|Jivaka Sutta}}\n\nThe Buddha held that because the food is given by a donor with good intentions, a monk should accept this as long as it is pure in these three respects. To refuse the offering would deprive the donor of the positive karma that giving provides. Moreover, it would create a certain conceit in the monks who would now pick and choose what food to eat. The Buddha did state however that the donor does generate bad karma for himself by killing an animal. In Theravada Buddhist countries, most people do eat meat, however.\n\nWhile there is no mention of Buddha endorsing or repudiating vegetarianism in surviving portions of [[Pali]] [[Tripitaka]] and no Mahayana sutras explicitly declare that meat eating violates the first precept, certain [[Mahayana sutras]] vigorously and unreservedly denounce the eating of meat, mainly on the ground that such an act violates the bodhisattva's compassion. The sutras which inveigh against meat-eating include the Mahayana version of the ''Nirvana Sutra,'' the ''Shurangama Sutra,'' the ''Brahmajala Sutra,'' the ''Angulimaliya Sutra,'' the ''Mahamegha Sutra,'' and the ''Lankavatara Sutra,'' as well as the Buddha's comments on the negative karmic effects of [[meat consumption]] in the ''Karma Sutra''.  In the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], which presents itself as the final elucidatory and definitive Mahayana teachings of the Buddha on the very eve of his death, the Buddha states that \"the eating of meat extinguishes the seed of Great Kindness\", adding that all and every kind of meat and fish consumption (even of animals found already dead) is prohibited by him. He specifically rejects the idea that monks who go out begging and receive meat from a donor should eat it: \". . . it should be rejected . . . I say that even meat, fish, game, dried hooves and scraps of meat left over by others constitutes an infraction . . . I teach the harm arising from meat-eating.\" The Buddha also predicts in this sutra that later monks will \"hold spurious writings to be the authentic Dharma\" and will concoct their own sutras and lyingly claim that the Buddha allows the eating of meat, whereas in fact he says he does not. A long passage in the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] shows the Buddha speaking out very forcefully against meat consumption and unequivocally in favor of vegetarianism, since the eating of the flesh of fellow sentient beings is said by him to be incompatible with the compassion that a Bodhisattva should strive to cultivate. In several other Mahayana scriptures, too (e.g., the Mahayana [[jatakas]]), the Buddha is seen clearly to indicate that meat-eating is undesirable and karmically unwholesome.\n\n==== Environment ====\nForests and jungles represented the ideal dwelling place for early Buddhists, and many texts praise the forest life as being helpful to meditation. Monks are not allowed to cut down trees as per the Vinaya, and the planting of trees and plants is seen as karmically fruitful. Because of this, Buddhist monasteries are often small nature preserves within the modernizing states in East Asia. The species [[ficus religiosa]] is seen as auspicious, because it is the same kind of tree that the Buddha gained enlightenment under.\n\nIn [[Mahayana Buddhism]], some teachings hold that trees and plants have [[Buddha nature]]. [[Kukai]] held that plants and trees, along with rocks and everything else, were manifestations of the 'One Mind' of [[Vairocana]] and [[Dogen]] held that plant life ''was'' [[Buddha nature]].\n\nIn pre-modern times, environmental issues were not widely discussed, though [[Ashoka]] banned the burning of forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken about the issue of environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that the root of the current ecological crisis is the belief that increased [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the [[Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement]] have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, there is no point in going against it. He advocates that a clean environment should be considered a basic human right and that it is our responsibility as humans to ensure that we do all we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Clean Environment Is a Human Right|url=http://www.dalailama.com/messages/environment/clean-environment/|publisher=[[14th Dalai Lama]]|date=2019-06-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Gender issues ===\n{{Main|Women in Buddhism}}\n[[File:Tibetan Nuns Volunteering Earthquake Zone.jpeg|thumb|right|225px| Buddhist nuns from the Tibetan tradition, volunteering in Kyegundo (Tibet Earthquake zone).]]\nIn pre-Buddhist Indian religion, women were seen as inferior and subservient to men. Buddha's teachings tended to promote gender equality as the Buddha held that women had the same spiritual capacities as men did. According to [[Isaline Blew Horner]], women in Buddhist India: \"commanded more respect and ranked as individuals. They enjoyed more independence, and a wider liberty to guide and follow their own lives.\"<ref>IB Horner, Women Under Primitive Buddhism, 1930, 82.</ref> Buddha gave the same teachings to both sexes, praised various female lay disciples for their wisdom and allowed women to become monastics ([[Bhikkhuni]]s) at a time when this was seen as scandalous in India, where men dominated the spiritual professions. The two chief female disciples of the Buddha were [[Khema]] and [[Uppalavanna]]. The Buddha taught that women had the same [[soteriological]] potential as men, and that gender had no influence on one's ability to advance spiritually to nirvana. In the early Buddhist texts, female enlightened [[Arhats]] are common. Buddhist nuns are however bound by an extra 8 precepts not applicable to Buddhist monks called [[The Eight Garudhammas]]. The authenticity of these rules is highly contested; they were supposedly added to the ([[bhikkhuni]]s) [[Vinaya]] \"to allow more acceptance\" of a monastic Order for women, during the Buddha's time but can be interpreted as a form of [[gender discrimination]].<ref>[http://www.dhammadharini.net/dhamma-talks-from-the-bhikkhuni-sangha/aranya-bodhi-hermitage/non-historicity-of-the-eight-garudhammas On the Apparent Non-historicity of the Eight Garudhammas Story] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103030748/http://www.dhammadharini.net/dhamma-talks-from-the-bhikkhuni-sangha/aranya-bodhi-hermitage/non-historicity-of-the-eight-garudhammas |date=November 3, 2013 }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100726221345/http://www.bhikkhuni.net/library/anaalayo-gender-discrimination-canon.html Gender Discrimination and the Pali Canon]</ref> Alan Sponberg argues that the early Buddhist sangha sought social acceptance through 'institutional [[androcentrism]]' as it was dependent on material support from lay society.

Some [[Vajrayana|Buddhist Tantric]] texts include female consorts for each heavenly Buddha or Bodhisattva. In these Tantric couples, the female symbolizes wisdom ([[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|prajna]]) and the male symbolizes skillful means ([[upaya]]).<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 363.</ref> The union of these two qualities is often depicted as sexual union, known as [[yab-yum]] (father-mother).\n\nIn [[East Asia]], the idea of [[Buddha nature]] being inherent in all beings is taken to mean that, spiritually at least, the sexes are equal, and this is expressed by the [[\u015ar\u012bm\u0101l\u0101dev\u012b Si\u1e43han\u0101da S\u016btra|Lion's Roar of Queen Srimala sutra]]. Based on this ideal of Buddha nature, the Chinese Chan ([[Zen]]) school emphasized the equality of the sexes. [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089\u20131163) of the Chinese [[Rinzai school|Linji school]] said of women in Buddhism: \"For mastering the truth, it does not matter whether one is male or female, noble or base.\" <ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 366.</ref> The Japanese founder of [[Soto Zen]], [[Dogen]] wrote: \"If you wish to hear the Dharma and put an end to pain and turmoil, forget about such things as male and female. As long as delusions have not yet been eliminated, neither men nor women have eliminated them; when they are all eliminated and true reality is experienced, there is no distinction of male and female.\"<ref>Francis Harold Cook, Francis Dojun Cook, Eihei Dogen; How to Raise an Ox: Zen Practice as Taught in Master Dogen's Shobogenzo, page 105.</ref>\n\nThe attitude of Buddhists towards gender has been varied throughout history as it has been influenced by each particular culture and belief system such as [[Confucianism]] (which sees women as subservient) and [[Hinduism]]. The Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] (5th century CE) for example, seems to have been influenced by his [[Brahmin]] background in stating that rebirth as a male is higher than rebirth as a female.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 370.</ref> Some Mahayana sutras such as the \u2018Sutra on Changing the Female Sex\u2019 and the \u2018Questions of the Daughter Pure Faith\u2019 also echo this idea. For various historical and cultural reasons such as wars and invasions, the orders of ordained Buddhist nuns disappeared or was never introduced in Southeast Asia and Tibet, though they slowly started being reintroduced by nuns such as [[Ayya Khema]], [[Dhammananda Bhikkhuni]], [[Tenzin Palmo]] and [[Thubten Chodron]]. Until very recently, China, Taiwan and Korea were the only places where fully ordained bhiksuni lineages still existed. An international conference of Buddhist nuns was held on February 1987 at [[Bodh Gaya]] and saw the formation of 'Sakyadhita' (Daughters of the Buddha) the International Association of Buddhist Women which focuses on helping Buddhist nuns throughout the world.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 400.</ref>\n\n=== Relationships ===\nThe Buddha placed much importance on the cultivation of good will and compassion towards one's parents, spouse, friends and all other beings. Buddhism strongly values harmony in the family and community. Keeping the five precepts and having a generous attitude (Dana) is seen as the foundation for this harmony. An important text, seen as the lay people's Vinaya (code of conduct) is the [[Sigalovada Sutta]] which outlines wrong action and warns against the squandering of wealth. The [[Sigalovada Sutta]] outlines how a virtuous person \"worships the six directions\" which are parents (East), teachers (South), wife (West), and friends and colleagues (North), and the two vertical directions as: ascetics and Brahmins (Up) and the Servants (Down). The text elaborates on how to respect and support them, and how in turn the Six will return the kindness and support. The relationships are based on reciprocation, and it is understood one has no right to expect behavior from others unless one also performs good acts in their favor.\n\nParents for example, are to be respected and supported with the understanding that they are to have provided care and affection to oneself. In marriage, the sutta states that a householder should treat their wife by \"being courteous to her, by not despising her, by being faithful to her, by handing over authority to her, by providing her with adornments.\" while in return the wife \"performs her duties well, she is hospitable to relations and attendants, she is faithful, she protects what he brings, she is skilled and industrious in discharging her duties.\"<ref>Narada Thera (trans), Sigalovada Sutta: The Discourse to Sigala The Layperson's Code of Discipline, {{cite web |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.31.0.nara.html |title=Sigalovada Sutta: The Discourse to Sigala |accessdate=2012-06-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518095524/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.31.0.nara.html |archivedate=2016-05-18 }}</ref> The Buddha also stated that a wife and husband are to be each other's best friend (parama sakha). While monogamy is the predominant model for marriage, Buddhist societies have also practiced and accepted [[polygamy]] and [[polyandry]].<ref>Peter Harvey An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics Cambridge University Press 2000, page 101.</ref> Buddhism sees marriage not as sacred but as a secular partnership and hence has no issue with divorce.\n\n=== Sexuality{{anchor|Sexual misconduct}} ===\n{{Main|Buddhism and sexuality}}\nThe Third (or sometimes Fourth) of the [[Five Precepts]] of Buddhism states that one is to refrain from \"[[sexual misconduct]]\", which has various interpretations, but generally entails any sexual conduct which is harmful to others, such as rape, molestation and often adultery, although this depends on the local marriage and relationship customs. Buddhist [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s of most traditions are not only expected to refrain from all sexual activity but also take [[vows of celibacy]].\n\n==== Sexual orientation ====\n{{Main|Buddhism and sexual orientation}}\nAmong the Buddhist traditions there is a vast diversity of opinion about [[homosexuality]], and in interpreting the precedents which define \"sexual misconduct\" generally. Though there is no explicit condemnation of homosexuality in Buddhist sutras, be it [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] or [[Mantrayana]], societal and community attitudes and the historical view of practitioners have established precedents. Some ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' equate homosexuality with scriptural sexual misconduct prohibited by the [[Five Precepts]]. Other ''sangha'' hold that if sexuality is compassionate and/or consensual and does not contravene vows, then there is no karmic infraction, irrespective of whether it is same-sex or not. Buddhist communities in Western states as well as in Japan generally tend to be accepting of homosexuality. In Japan, homosexual relations among Buddhist samurai and clergy were actually quite common. Male homosexuality between clergy was especially common in the Tantric [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon school]].<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 427.</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[P\u0101li Canon]] & [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|\u0100gama]] (the Early Buddhist scriptures), there is no saying that same or opposite gender relations have anything to do with sexual misconduct,<ref name=\"cunda kammaraputta sutta\">{{cite web|title=Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta|trans-title=To Cunda the Silversmith|others=Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu|publisher=Access to Insight|year=1997|id=[[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 10.176|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.176.than.html| accessdate = 2011-03-14|quote=Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct.

This rule was established by the Buddha after a pandaka monk broke the Vinaya precepts by having relations with others. Therefore, it seems that pandakas were initially allowed into the Sangha. Later Buddhist texts like the [[Milinda Panha]] and the [[Abhidharma-kosa]] see pandakas as being spiritually hindered by their sexuality and mental defilements.\n\n=== Economic ethics ===\n[[File:Bhutan Gross National Happiness.jpg|thumb|260 px|right|[[Bhutan]]'s government promotes the concept of '[[Gross National Happiness]]' (GNH), based on Buddhist spiritual values.]]\n{{Main|Buddhist economics}}\nBuddha's teachings to laypeople included advice on how to make their living and how to use their wealth.

Early Buddhist texts see success in work as aided by one's spiritual and moral qualities.\n\nIn the Adiya Sutta the Buddha also outlined several ways in which people could put their 'righteously gained' wealth to use:<ref>AN 5.41, Adiya Sutta: Benefits to be Obtained (from Wealth) translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, {{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.041.than.html |title=Adiya Sutta: Benefits to be Obtained (from Wealth) |accessdate=2015-12-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420202447/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.041.than.html |archivedate=2016-04-20 }}</ref>\n#Providing 'pleasure & satisfaction' to themselves, their mother & father, their children, spouse, slaves, servants, & assistants.\n#Providing 'pleasure & satisfaction' to their friends and associates.\n#Warding off calamities coming from fire, flood, kings, thieves, or hateful heirs, and keeps himself safe.\n#Performs five oblations/offerings: to relatives, guests, the dead, kings, & devas.\n#Giving of offerings to priests ([[brahmins]]) and contemplatives (monks).\n\nThe Buddha placed much emphasis on the virtue of giving and sharing, and hence the practice of donating and charity are central to Buddhist economic ethics. Even the poor are encouraged to share, because this brings about greater spiritual wealth: \"If beings knew, as I know, the results of giving & sharing, they would not eat without having given, nor would the stain of selfishness overcome their minds. Even if it were their last bite, their last mouthful, they would not eat without having shared, if there were someone to receive their gift.\"<ref>Itivuttaka: The Group of Ones translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, {{cite web |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.1.001-027.than.html |title=Itivuttaka: The Group of Ones |accessdate=2015-12-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518095639/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.1.001-027.than.html |archivedate=2016-05-18 }}</ref> The modern growth of [[Engaged Buddhism]] has seen an emphasis on social work and charity. Buddhist aid and activist organizations include [[Buddhist Global Relief]], Lotus Outreach, [[Buddhist Peace Fellowship]], Piyarra Kutta, [[International Network of Engaged Buddhists]], The [[Tzu Chi]] Foundation, Nonviolent Peaceforce, and [[Zen Peacemakers]].\n\nBuddhist texts promote the building of public works which benefit the community and stories of Buddhist Kings like [[Ashoka]] are used as an example of lay people who promoted the public welfare by building hospitals and parks for the people. The Buddha's chief lay disciple, the rich merchant [[Anathapindika]] (\u2018Feeder of the Poor\u2019) is also another example of a virtuous layperson who donated much of his wealth for the benefit of others and was thus known as the \"foremost disciple in generosity\". Early Buddhist texts do not disparage merchants and trade, but instead promote enterprise as long as it is done ethically and leads to the well being of the community. The gold standard for rulers in Buddhism is the ideal wheel turning king, the [[Chakravartin]]. A Chakravartin is said to rule justly, giving to the needy and combating poverty so as to prevent social unrest. A Chakravartin does not fight wars for gain but only in defense of the kingdom, he accepts immigrants and refugees, and builds hospitals, parks, hostels, wells, canals and rest houses for the people and animals.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 198.</ref> [[Mahayana Buddhism]] maintains that lay Bodhisattvas should engage in social welfare activities for the good and safety of others.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 191.</ref> In the lands of Southern Buddhism, Buddhist monasteries often became places were the poor, destitute, orphaned, elderly can take shelter.

[[E. F.

It has been variously described as [[virtue]],<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 170; Harvey (2007), p. 199; \u00d1\u0101{{IAST|\u1e47}}amoli (1999), pp. 3 ''passim''; Nyanatiloka (1988), [http://www.budsas.org/ebud/bud-dict/dic3_s.htm entry for \"s\u012bla\"]; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613033615/http://www.budsas.org/ebud/bud-dict/dic3_s.htm |date=June 13, 2016 }} [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/perfections.html Thanissaro (1999)]; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613033615/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/perfections.html |date=June 1389; Nyanatiloka (1988), [http://www.budsas.org/ebud/bud-dict/dic3_s.htm entry for \"s\u012bla\"]; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613033615/http://www.budsas.org/ebud/bud-dict/dic3_s.htm |date=June 13, 2016 }} and Saddhatissa (1987), pp. 54, 56.</ref> moral discipline<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 153.</ref> and [[precept]].\n\n''S\u012bla'' is an internal, aware, and intentional ethical behavior, according to one's commitment to the path of liberation. It is an ethical compass within self and relationships, rather than what is associated with the English word \"morality\" (i.e., obedience, a sense of obligation, and external constraint).\n\n''S\u012bla'' is one of the [[Threefold Training|three practices]] foundational to Buddhism and the non-sectarian [[Vipassana movement]] \u2014 ''s\u012bla,'' ''[[Samadhi#Buddhism|sam\u0101dhi]],'' and ''[[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101]]'' as well as the Theravadin foundations of ''s\u012bla,'' ''[[D\u0101na]],'' and ''[[Bhavana]].''

Oxford: Pali Text Society. {{ISBN|0-86013-072-X}}</ref> S\u012bla is also wholehearted commitment to what is wholesome. Two aspects of s\u012bla are essential to the training: right \"performance\" (caritta), and right \"avoidance\" (varitta). Honoring the precepts of ''s\u012bla'' is considered a \"great gift\"  (mahadana) to others, because it creates an atmosphere of trust, respect, and security.  It means the practitioner poses no threat to another person's life, property, family, rights, or well-being.<ref>Living This Life Fully:  Teachings of Anagarika Munindra, by Mirka Knaster Ph.D., Shambhala Publications, USA, 2010.  Pg. 67</ref>\n\nMoral instructions are included in Buddhist scriptures or handed down through tradition. Most scholars of Buddhist ethics thus rely on the examination of [[Buddhist scriptures]], and the use of anthropological evidence from traditional Buddhist societies, to justify claims about the nature of Buddhist ethics.<ref>Damien Keown ''The Nature of Buddhist Ethics'' Macmillan 1992; Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000</ref>\n\n== Foundations ==\nThe source for the ethics of Buddhists around the world are the [[Three Jewels]] of the [[Buddha]], [[Dharma#Buddhism|Dharma]] and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. The Buddha is seen as the discoverer of liberating knowledge and hence the foremost teacher. The Dharma is both the teachings of the Buddha's path and the truths of these teachings. The Sangha is the community of noble ones (ariya), who practice the Dhamma and have attained some knowledge and can thus provide guidance and preserve the teachings. Having proper understanding of the teachings is vital for proper ethical conduct. The Buddha taught that [[right view]] was a necessary prerequisite for right conduct, sometimes also referred to as right intention.\n\n=== Karma and rebirth ===\n[[File:The wheel of life%2C Trongsa dzong.jpg|thumb|225px|The ''[[bhavacakra]]'' (wheel of life) shows the realms of karmic rebirth, at its hub are the three poisons of greed, hatred and delusion.]]\nA central foundation for Buddhist morality is the law of [[karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. The Buddha is recorded to have stated that right view consisted in believing that (among other things): \"'there is fruit and ripening of deeds well done or ill done': what one does matters and has an effect on one\u2019s future; 'there is this world, there is a world beyond': this world is not unreal, and one goes on to another world after death\" ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 117, Maha-cattarisaka Sutta).\n\nKarma is a word which literally means \"action\" and is seen as a natural law of the universe which manifests as cause and effect. In the Buddhist conception, Karma is a certain type of moral action which has moral consequences on the actor.<ref name=\"Keown, Damien pg 5\">Keown, Damien; Buddhist Ethics A Very Short Introduction, pg 5.</ref> The core of karma is the mental intention, and hence the Buddha stated  \u2018It is intention (cetana), O monks, that I call karma; having willed one acts through body, speech, or mind\u2019 ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 6.63). Therefore, accidentally hurting someone is not bad Karma, but having hurtful thoughts is. Buddhist ethics sees these patterns of motives and actions as conditioning future actions and circumstances \u2013 the fruit ([[Phala]]) of one's present actions, including the condition and place of the actor's future life circumstances (though these can also be influenced by other random factors).<ref name=\"Keown, Damien pg 5\" /> One's past actions are said to mold one's consciousness and to leave seeds ([[B\u012bja]]) which later ripen in the next life. The goal of Buddhist practice is generally to break the cycle, though one can also work for rebirth in a better condition through good deeds.\n\nThe root of one's intention is what conditions an action to be good or bad. There are three good roots (non-attachment, benevolence, and understanding) and [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three negative roots]] (greed, hatred and delusion). Actions which produce good outcomes are termed \"[[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]]\" (pu\u00f1\u00f1a \u2013 fruitful, auspicious) and obtaining merit (good karma) is an important goal of lay Buddhist practice. The early Buddhist texts mention three 'bases for effecting karmic fruitfulness\u2019 (''pu\u00f1\u00f1a-kiriya-vatthus''): giving (dana), moral virtue (sila) and meditation (bh\u0101van\u0101).<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 19.</ref> One's state of mind while performing good actions is seen as more important than the action itself. The Buddhist Sangha is seen as the most meritorious \"field of merit\". Negative actions accumulate bad karmic results, though one's regret and attempts to make up for it can ameliorate these results.\n\n=== The Four Noble Truths ===\nThe [[Four Noble Truths]] are:\n* ''[[dukkha]]'' (suffering, incapable of satisfying, painful) is an innate characteristic of existence with each rebirth;<ref name=\"EB-4NTa\">[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Four-Noble-Truths Four Noble Truths: BUDDHIST PHILOSOPHY], Encyclopaedia Britannica, Quote: \"The first truth, suffering (Pali: dukkha; Sanskrit: duhkha), is characteristic of existence in the realm of rebirth, called samsara (literally \u201cwandering\u201d).\"</ref><ref name=buswell4NTa>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|editor=Robert E Buswell Jr|publisher=MacMillan Reference, Thomson Gale|year=2004|isbn=0-02-865718-7|author=Carol Anderson|pages=295-297}}, Quote: \"This, bhikkhus, is the noble truth that is suffering.

''Dukkha'' is seen to arise from craving, and putting an end to craving can lead to liberation ([[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]]). The way to put an end to craving is by following the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] taught by the Buddha, which includes the ethical elements of right speech, right action and right livelihood. From the point of view of the Four Noble Truths, an action is seen as ethical if it is conductive to the elimination of ''dukkha''. Understanding the truth of ''dukkha'' in life allows one to analyze the factors for its arising, that is craving, and allows us to feel compassion and sympathy for others. Comparing oneself with others and then applying the [[Golden Rule]] is said to follow from this appreciation of ''dukkha''.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000</ref>  From the Buddhist perspective, an act is also moral if it promotes spiritual development by conforming to the Eightfold Path and leading to Nirvana. In Mahayana Buddhism, an emphasis is made on the liberation of all beings and ''[[bodhisattvas]]'' are believed to work tirelessly for the liberation of all.\n\n=== Precepts ===\n[[File:Dennis Genpo Merzel Jukai (Shasui).jpg|thumb|right|225px| In the [[Zen Buddhist]] initiation ceremony of [[Buddhist initiation ritual#S\u014dt\u014d school|Jukai]], initiates take up the [[Bodhisattva Precepts]].]]\n{{Main|Five Precepts}}\nThe foundation of Buddhist ethics for laypeople is [[The Five Precepts]] which are common to all Buddhist schools. The precepts or \"five moral virtues\" (''pa\u00f1ca-silani'') are not commands but a set of voluntary commitments or guidelines,{{sfn|Keown |2003 |page=268 }} to help one live a life in which one is happy, without worries, and able to meditate well. The precepts are supposed to prevent suffering and to weaken the effects of greed, hatred and delusion. They were the basic moral instructions which the Buddha gave to laypeople and monks alike.

The [[eight precepts]] encourage further discipline and are modeled on the monastic code. In the [[eight precepts]], the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict and becomes a precept of celibacy. The three additional rules of the Eight Precepts are:<ref name=\"bodhimonastery\" />\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\u201cI accept the training rule to abstain from food at improper times.\u201d (e.g. no solid foods after noon, and not until dawn the following day)</li>\n<li>\u201cI accept the training rule (a) to abstain from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and shows, and (b) from the use of jewelry, cosmetics, and beauty lotions.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cI accept the training rule to abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds and seats.\u201d</li>\n</ol>\n\n[[Samanera|Novice-monks]] use the [[Ten Precepts (Buddhism)|ten precepts]] while fully ordained Buddhist monks also have a larger set of monastic precepts, called the [[Pr\u0101timok\u1e63a]] (227 rules for monks in the Therav\u0101din recension). Monks are supposed to be celibate and are also traditionally not allowed to touch money. The rules and code of conduct for monks and nuns is outlined in the [[Vinaya]]. The precise content of the [[vinayapitaka|scriptures on ''vinaya'']] (''vinayapi\u1e6daka'') differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to the ''vinaya''.\n\nIn [[Mahayana Buddhism]], another common set of moral guidelines are the [[Bodhisattva vows]] and the [[Bodhisattva Precepts]] or the \"Ten Great Precepts\". The Bodhisattva Precepts which is derived from the Mahayana [[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahmajala Sutra]] include the Five precepts with some other additions such as the precept against slandering the Buddha's teachings.

The community of monastics is seen as the most meritorious field of karmic fruitfulness.]]\n{{Buddhist Philosophy sidebar}}\nFollowing the precepts is not the only dimension of Buddhist morality, there are also several important virtues, motivations and habits which are widely promoted by Buddhist texts and traditions. At the core of these virtues are the three roots of non-attachment (araga), benevolence (advesa), and understanding (amoha).\n\nOne list of virtues which is widely promoted in Buddhism are the [[P\u0101ramit\u0101]]s (perfections) \u2013 [[D\u0101na]] (generosity), [[\u015a\u012bla|S\u012bla]] (proper conduct), [[Nekkhamma]] (renunciation), [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101]] (wisdom), [[V\u012brya|Viriya]] (energy), [[Kshanti|Khanti]] (patience), [[Sacca]] (honesty), [[Adhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na]] (determination), [[Mett\u0101]] (Good-Will), [[Upekkha|Upekkh\u0101]] (equanimity).\n\nThe Four divine abidings ([[Brahmaviharas]]) are seen as central virtues and intentions in Buddhist ethics, psychology and meditation. The four divine abidings are [[metta|good will]], [[Karu\u1e47\u0101|compassion]], [[Mudita|empathetic joy]], and [[Upekkha|equanimity]]. Developing these virtues through meditation and right action promotes happiness, generates good merit and trains the mind for ethical action.\n\nAn important quality which supports right action is Heedfulness ([[Appamada]]), a combination of energy/effort ([[Viriya]]) and Mindfulness. [[Mindfulness]] is an alert presence of mind which allows one to be more aware of what is happening with one's intentional states. Heedfulness is aided by 'clear comprehension' or 'discrimination' ([[Sampaja\u00f1\u00f1a]]), which gives rise to moral knowledge of what is to be done. Another important supporting quality of Buddhist morality is [[Faith in Buddhism|Trust or Confidence]] in the teachings of the Buddha and in one's own ability to put them into practice. [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|Wisdom]] and Understanding are seen as a prerequisite for acting morally. Having an understanding of the true nature of reality is seen as leading to ethical actions. Understanding the truth of [[Anatta|not-self]] for example, allows one to become detached from selfish motivations and therefore allows one to be more altruistic. Having an understanding of the workings of the mind and of the law of karma also makes one less likely to perform an unethical action.\n\nThe Buddha promoted \u2018self-respect\u2019 ([[Hri (Buddhism)|Hri]]) and Regard for consequences ([[Apatrapya]]), as important virtues. Self-respect is what caused a person to avoid actions which were seen to harm one's integrity and Ottappa is an awareness of the effects of one's actions and sense of embarrassment before others.\n\nGiving ([[D\u0101na]]) is seen as the beginning of virtue in Theravada Buddhism and as the basis for developing further on the path. In Buddhist countries, this is seen in the giving of alms to Buddhist monastics but also extends to generosity in general (towards family, friends, coworkers, guests, animals).<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 62.</ref> Giving is said to make one happy, generate good merit as well as develop non-attachment, therefore it is not just good because it creates good karmic fruits, but it also develops one's spiritual qualities. In Buddhist thought, the cultivation of [[Dana (Buddhism)|dana]] and ethical conduct will themselves refine consciousness to such a level that rebirth in one of the lower hells is unlikely, even if there is no further Buddhist practice. There is nothing improper or un-Buddhist about limiting one's aims to this level of attainment.<ref name=\"Peter Harvey 2001, pages 195-196\" />\n\nAn important value in Buddhist ethics is non-harming or non-violence ([[ahimsa]]) to all living creatures from the lowest insect to humans which is associated with the first precept of not killing. The Buddhist practice of this does not extend to the extremes exhibited by [[Jainism]] (in Buddhism, unintentional killing is not karmically bad), but from both the Buddhist and Jain perspectives, non-violence suggests an intimate involvement with, and relationship to, all living things.<ref>Carl Olson, ''The Different Paths of Buddhism'' p.73</ref>\n\nThe Buddha also emphasized that \u2018good friendship ([[Kaly\u0101\u1e47a-mittat\u0101]]), good association, good intimacy\u2019 was the whole, not the half of the holy life ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 45.2). Developing strong friendships with good people on the spiritual path is seen as a key aspect of Buddhism and as a key way to support and grow in one's practice.\n\nIn [[Mahayana Buddhism]], another important foundation for moral action is the [[Bodhisattva]] ideal. Bodhisattvas are beings which have chosen to work towards the salvation of all living beings. In Mahayana Buddhist texts, this path of great compassion is promoted as being superior to that of the [[Arhat]] because the Bodhisattva is seen as working for the benefit of all beings.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 130.</ref> A Bodhisattva is one who arouses a powerful emotion called [[Bodhicitta]] (mind of enlightenment) which is a mind which is oriented towards the awakening of oneself and all beings.\n\n== Issues ==\n\n=== Killing ===\n[[File:Saito Musashi-bo Benkei - tales of the wars of the Gempei, being the story of the lives and adventures of Iyo-no-Kami Minamoto Kuro Yoshitsune and Saito Musashi-bo Benkei the warrior monk (1910) (14780268451).jpg|thumb|200px|Japanese illustration of Iyo-no-Kami Minamoto Kuro Yoshitsune and [[Benkei|Saito Musashi-bo Benkei]], the Buddhist [[Sohei|warrior monk]].]]\n\nThe first precept is the abstaining from the taking of life, and the Buddha clearly stated that the taking of human or animal life would lead to negative karmic consequences and was non conductive to liberation. Right livelihood includes not trading in weapons or in hunting and butchering animals. Various suttas state that one should always have a mind filled with compassion and loving kindness for all beings, this is to be extended to hurtful, evil people as in the case of [[Angulimala]] the murderer and to every kind of animal, even pests and vermin (monks are not allowed to kill any animal, for any reason). Buddhist teachings and institutions therefore tend to promote peace and compassion, acting as safe havens during times of conflict.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 239.</ref> In spite of this, some Buddhists, including monastics such as Japanese [[Sohei|warrior monks]] have historically performed acts of violence. In China, the [[Shaolin Monastery]] developed a [[martial arts]] tradition to defend themselves from attack.\n\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, the concept of skillful means ([[upaya]]) has in some circumstances been used to excuse the act of killing, if it is being done for compassionate reasons. This form of \"compassionate killing\" is allowed by the ''Upaya-kausalya sutra'' and the ''Maha-Upaya-kausalya sutra'' only when it \"follows from virtuous thought.\"<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 135.</ref> Some texts acknowledge the negative karmic consequences of killing, and yet promote it out of compassion. The ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Bodhisattva-bhumi]]'', a key Mahayana text, states that if a Bodhisattva sees someone about to kill other Bodhisattvas, they may take it upon themselves to kill this murderer with the thought that:\n\n\"If I take the life of this sentient being, I myself may be reborn as one of the creatures of hell. Better that I be reborn a creature of hell than that this living being, having committed a deed of immediate retribution, should go straight to hell.\"<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 137.</ref>\n\nIf then, the intention is purely to protect others from evil, the act of killing is sometimes seen as meritorious.\n\n==== War ====\n{{Main|Ahimsa#Buddhism}}\n{{See also|Criticism of Buddhism#War and violence}}\n[[File:Museum of Ethnology Vienna 002.JPG|thumb|220px|Statue portrait of [[5th Dalai Lama]].]]\nThe Buddhist analysis of conflict begins with the '[[Three poisons (Buddhism)|Three Poisons]]' of greed, hatred and delusion. Craving and attachment, the cause of suffering, is also the cause of conflict. Buddhist philosopher [[Shantideva]] states in his ''Siksasamuccaya'': \"Wherever conflict arises among living creatures, the sense of possession is the cause\". Craving for material resources as well as grasping to political or religious views is seen as a major source of war. One's attachment to self-identity, and identification with tribe, nation state or religion is also another root of human conflict according to Buddhism.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 240.</ref>\n\nThe Buddha promoted [[non-violence]] in various ways, he encouraged his followers not to fight in wars and not to sell or trade weapons. The Buddha stated that in war, both victor and defeated suffer: \"The victor begets enmity. The vanquished dwells in sorrow. The tranquil lives happily, abandoning both victory and defeat\" ([[Dhammapada]], 201). Buddhist philosopher [[Candrak\u012brti]] wrote that soldiery was not a respectable profession: \"the sacrifice of life in battle should not be respected, since this is the basis for harmful actions.\"<ref name=Goodman>Goodman, Charles, \"Ethics in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/ethics-indian-buddhism/>{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref> The [[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra]] states that those who take the [[Bodhisattva vows]] should not take any part in war, watch a battle, procure or store weapons, praise or approve of killers and aid the killing of others in any way. In his [[Abhidharma-kosa]], [[Vasubandhu]] writes that all soldiers in an army are guilty of the killing of the army, not just those who perform the actual killing.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 254.</ref> Modern Buddhist peace activists include The [[14th Dalai Lama]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Sulak Sivaraksa]], [[A. T. Ariyaratne]], [[Preah Maha Ghosananda]] and [[Nichidatsu Fujii]].\n\nWhile [[pacifism]] is the Buddhist ideal, Buddhist states and kingdoms have waged war throughout history and Buddhists have found ways to justify these conflicts. The [[5th Dalai Lama]] who was installed as the head of Buddhism in Tibet by [[Gushri Khan]] after the [[Khoshut Khanate|Oirat invasion of Tibet]] (1635\u20131642), praised the acts of the Khan and said that he was an emanation of the great Bodhisattva [[Vajrapani]].<ref name=Goodman /> Under the fifth Dalai Lama and the powerful Gelug Regent Sonam Chophel (1595\u20131657), treasurer of the Ganden Palace, the Tibetan kingdom launched invasions of [[Bhutan]] (c. 1647, ending in failure) and [[Ladakh]] (c. 1679, which regained previously lost Tibetan territory) with Mongol aid.<ref>Samten G. Karmay, The Great Fifth, IIAS Newsletter #39 December 2005, https://iias.asia/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL39_1213.pdf</ref>\n\nAnother example is that of Buddhist [[Sohei|warrior monks]] in [[feudal Japan]] who sometimes committed organized acts of war, protecting their territories and attacking rival Buddhist sects. During the late [[Heian Period]], the [[Tendai]] school was a particularly powerful sect, whose influential monasteries could wield armies of monks. A key text of this sect was the [[Mah\u0101y\u0101na Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47a S\u016btra]], which contains passages allowing the use of violence for the defense of the Dharma.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 265.</ref> The [[Ashikaga period]] saw military conflict between the Tendai school, [[J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b]] school and the [[Nichiren]] Buddhists. [[Zen Buddhism]] was influential among the [[samurai]], and their [[Bushido]] code.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] almost all [[Japanese Buddhism|Japanese Buddhists temples]] (except the [[Soka Gakkai]]) strongly supported Japanese imperialism and militarization.<ref>Gier, Nicholas, F.

The [[Jataka]] stories contain tales of women who perform abortions being reborn in a [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell]]. In the case where the mother's life is in jeopardy, many traditional Buddhists agree that abortion is permissible.

Ending one's life to escape present suffering is seen as futile because one will just be reborn again, and again. One of the three forms of craving is craving for annihilation ([[Ta\u1e47h\u0101#Vibhava-tanha (craving not to be)|vibhava tanha]]), and this form of craving is the root of future suffering. Dying with an unwholesome and agitated state of mind is seen as leading to a bad rebirth, so [[suicide]] is seen as creating negative karma.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 287.</ref> Ending one's life is also seen as throwing away the precious opportunity to generate positive karma. While suicide does not seem to be interpreted as a breaking of the first precept (not killing other beings) it is still seen as a grave and unwholesome action.<ref name=\"Peter Harvey 2000, page 288\">Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 288.</ref>\n\nIn [[Theravada Buddhism]], for a monk to praise the advantages of death, including simply telling a person of the miseries of life or the bliss of dying and going to heaven in such a way that he/she might feel inspired to commit suicide or simply pine away to death, is explicitly stated as a breach in one of highest vinaya codes regarding the prohibition of harming life, hence it will result in automatic expulsion from [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].<ref>Pruitt & Norman, ''The Patimokkha'', 2001, Pali Text Society, Lancaster, Defeat 3</ref>\n\nBuddhism sees the experience of dying as a very sensitive moment in one's spiritual life, because the quality of one's mind at the time of death is believed to condition one's future rebirth.<ref name=\"Peter Harvey 2000, page 288\" /> The Buddhist ideal is to die in a calm but conscious state, while learning to let go. Dying consciously, without negative thoughts but rather joyously with good thoughts in mind is seen as a good transition into the next life. Chanting and reciting Buddhist texts is a common practice; in Tibet the [[Bardo Thodol]] is used to guide the dying to a good rebirth.<ref name=\"Peter Harvey 2000, page 288\" />\n\nTraditional Buddhism would hold [[Euthanasia]], where one brings about the death of a suffering patient (whether or not they desire this) so as to prevent further pain, as a breach of the first precept.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 295.</ref> The argument that such a killing is an act of compassion because it prevents suffering is unacceptable to traditional Buddhist theology because it is seen to be deeply rooted in delusion. This is because the suffering being who was euthanized would just end up being reborn and having to suffer due to their karma (even though not all suffering is due to karma), and hence killing them does not help them escape suffering.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 296.</ref> The [[Abhidharma-kosa]] clearly states that the killing of one's sick and aged parents is an act of delusion. The act of killing someone in the process of death also ruins their chance to mindfully experience pain and learn to let go of the body, hence desire for euthanasia would be a form of aversion to physical pain and a craving for non-becoming. According to [[Kalu Rinpoche]] however, choosing to be removed from life support is karmically neutral.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 301.</ref> The choice not to receive medical treatment when one is terminally ill is then not seen as morally reprehensible, as long as it does not arise from a feeling of aversion to life. This would also apply to not resuscitating a terminal patient.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to the injunction against suicide. Several Pali suttas contain stories where self-euthanizing is not seen as unethical by the Buddha, showing that the issue is more complex. These exceptions, such as the story of the monk Channa and that of the monk Vakkali, typically deal with advanced Buddhist practitioners. In these exceptional cases, both Channa and Vakkali are both said to be enlightened [[arhats]] and euthanized themselves in a calm and detached state of mind.<ref>At wood, Michael. Suicide as A Response to Suffering. http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol4/suicide_as_a_response_to_suffering.html</ref>\n\nIn East-Asian and Tibetan Buddhism, the practice of [[Self-immolation]] developed.

However, capital punishment has been used in most historically Buddhist states. The first of the [[Five Precepts]] (Panca-sila) is to abstain from destruction of life. Chapter 10 of the [[Dhammapada]] states:\n\n:''\"Everyone fears punishment; everyone fears death, just as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill. Everyone fears punishment; everyone loves life, as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill''\".\n\nChapter 26, the final chapter of the Dhammapada, states \"Him I call a [[brahmin]] who has put aside weapons and renounced violence toward all creatures. He neither kills nor helps others to kill\". These sentences are interpreted by many Buddhists (especially in the West) as an injunction against supporting any legal measure which might lead to the death penalty. However, almost throughout history, countries where Buddhism has been the official religion (which have included most of the [[Far East]] and [[Indochina]]) have practiced the death penalty. One exception is the abolition of the death penalty by the [[Emperor Saga]] of [[Japan]] in 818. This lasted until 1165, although in private manors executions conducted as a form of retaliation continued to be performed.\n\n=== Animals and the environment ===\n{{Main|Animals in Buddhism}}\n[[File:Buddha Worshipped in Jungle by Animals - Middle Architrave - Rear Side - East Gateway - Stupa 1 - Sanchi Hill 2013-02-21 4462.JPG|thumb|right|225px|The Buddha, represented by the [[Bodhi tree]], attended by animals, [[Sanchi]] vihara.]]\nBuddhism does not see humans as being in a special moral category over animals or as having any kind of God given dominion over them as [[Christianity]] does.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 150.</ref> Humans are seen as being more able to make moral choices, and this means that they should protect and be kind to animals who are also suffering beings who are living in [[samsara]]. Buddhism also sees humans as part of nature, not as separate from it. [[Thich Naht Hanh]] summarizes the Buddhist view of harmony with nature thus:\n\n<blockquote>We classify other animals and living beings as nature, acting as if we ourselves are not part of it. Then we pose the question \u2018How should we deal with Nature?\u2019 We should deal with nature the way we should deal with ourselves! We should not harm ourselves; we should not harm nature...Human beings and nature are inseparable.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 151.</ref></blockquote>\n\nEarly Buddhist monastics spent a lot of time in the forests, which was seen as an excellent place for meditation and this tradition continues to be practiced by the monks of the [[Thai Forest Tradition]].\n\n==== Vegetarianism ====\n{{Main|Buddhist vegetarianism}}\nThere is a divergence of views within Buddhism on the need for vegetarianism, with some schools of Buddhism rejecting such a claimed need and with most Buddhists in fact eating meat. Many [[Mahayana]] Buddhists \u2013 especially the Chinese and Vietnamese traditions \u2013 strongly oppose meat-eating on [[scriptural]] grounds.<ref>[http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/BuddhismAnimalsVegetarian/BuddhistVegetarian.htm Buddhist Resources on Vegetarianism and Animal Welfare] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911135953/http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/BuddhismAnimalsVegetarian/BuddhistVegetarian.htm |date=September 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe first precept of Buddhism focuses mainly on direct participation in the destruction of life. This is one reason that the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] made a distinction between killing animals and eating meat, and refused to introduce vegetarianism into monastic practice. While early Buddhist texts like the [[Pali Canon]] frown upon hunting, butchering, fishing and 'trading in flesh' (meat or livestock) as professions, they do not ban the act of eating meat. Direct participation also includes ordering or encouraging someone to kill an animal for you.\n\nThe Buddhist king [[Ashoka]] promoted vegetarian diets and attempted to decrease the number of animals killed for food in his kingdom by introducing 'no slaughter days' during the year. He gave up hunting trips, banned the killing of specific animals and decreased the use of meat in the royal household. Ashoka even banned the killing of some vermin or pests. His example was followed by later Sri Lankan kings.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 158.</ref> One of Ashoka's rock edicts states:\n<blockquote>Here (in my domain) no living beings are to be slaughtered or offered in sacrifice...Formerly, in the kitchen of Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, hundreds of thousands of animals were killed every day to make curry. But now with the writing of this Dhamma edict only three creatures, two peacocks and a deer are killed, and the deer not always. And in time, not even these three creatures will be killed.<ref>The Edicts of King Asoka an English rendering by Ven. S.

While Buddhist theory tends to equate killing animals with killing people (and avoids the conclusion that killing can sometimes be ethical, e.g. defense of others), outside of the Chinese and Vietnamese monastic tradition, most Buddhists do eat meat in practice.<ref name=\"Dharma Data: Vegetarianism\">[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/dharmadata/fdd21.htm Dharma Data: Vegetarianism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109235226/http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/dharmadata/fdd21.htm |date=November 9, 2016 }}</ref> There is some controversy surrounding whether or not the Buddha himself died from eating rancid pork.<ref>[http://www.hsuyun.com/vegetarian.html Vegetarianism and Buddhism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305033324/http://www.hsuyun.com/vegetarian.html |date=March 5, 2016 }}</ref> While most Chinese and Vietnamese monastics are vegetarian,<ref name=\"Dharma Data: Vegetarianism\" /> vegetarian Tibetans are rare, due to the harsh Himalayan climate.<ref name=\"Dharma Data: Vegetarianism\" /> Japanese lay people tend to eat meat, but monasteries tend to be vegetarian.<ref name=\"Dharma Data: Vegetarianism\" /> The [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]], after contracting [[Hepatitis B]], was advised by doctors to switch to a high animal-protein diet.<ref>{{cite book| author =Dalai Lama| authorlink =| title =Freedom in exile: the autobiography of the Dalai Lama| publisher =HarperOne| year =1991| location =| pages =[https://archive.org/details/freedominexilea000bsta/page/184 184]\u2013185| url =https://archive.org/details/freedominexilea000bsta| url-access =registration| quote =dalai lama hepatitis.| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-06-098701-4}}</ref> The [[Dalai Lama]] eats vegetarian every second day, so he effectively eats a vegetarian diet for 6 months of the year.<ref>[[Norm Phelps|Phelps, Norm]]. (2004). ''The Great Compassion: Buddhism and Animal Rights''. Lantern Books.</ref> In the West, vegetarianism among Buddhists is also common.\n\nIn the [[P\u0101li|Pali]] version of the [[Tripitaka]], there are number of occasions in which the Buddha ate meat as well as recommending certain types of meat as a cure for medical conditions. On one occasion, a general sent a servant to purchase meat specifically to feed the Buddha. The Buddha declared that:\n{{quote|\nMeat should not be eaten under three circumstances: when it is seen or heard or suspected (that a living being has been purposely slaughtered for the eater); these, [[Jivaka]], are the three circumstances in which meat should not be eaten, Jivaka! I declare there are three circumstances in which meat can be eaten: when it is not seen or heard or suspected (that a living being has been purposely slaughtered for the eater); Jivaka, I say these are the three circumstances in which meat can be eaten.|Jivaka Sutta}}\n\nThe Buddha held that because the food is given by a donor with good intentions, a monk should accept this as long as it is pure in these three respects. To refuse the offering would deprive the donor of the positive karma that giving provides. Moreover, it would create a certain conceit in the monks who would now pick and choose what food to eat. The Buddha did state however that the donor does generate bad karma for himself by killing an animal. In Theravada Buddhist countries, most people do eat meat, however.\n\nWhile there is no mention of Buddha endorsing or repudiating vegetarianism in surviving portions of [[Pali]] [[Tripitaka]] and no Mahayana sutras explicitly declare that meat eating violates the first precept, certain [[Mahayana sutras]] vigorously and unreservedly denounce the eating of meat, mainly on the ground that such an act violates the bodhisattva's compassion. The sutras which inveigh against meat-eating include the Mahayana version of the ''Nirvana Sutra,'' the ''Shurangama Sutra,'' the ''Brahmajala Sutra,'' the ''Angulimaliya Sutra,'' the ''Mahamegha Sutra,'' and the ''Lankavatara Sutra,'' as well as the Buddha's comments on the negative karmic effects of [[meat consumption]] in the ''Karma Sutra''.  In the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], which presents itself as the final elucidatory and definitive Mahayana teachings of the Buddha on the very eve of his death, the Buddha states that \"the eating of meat extinguishes the seed of Great Kindness\", adding that all and every kind of meat and fish consumption (even of animals found already dead) is prohibited by him. He specifically rejects the idea that monks who go out begging and receive meat from a donor should eat it: \". . . it should be rejected . . . I say that even meat, fish, game, dried hooves and scraps of meat left over by others constitutes an infraction . . . I teach the harm arising from meat-eating.\" The Buddha also predicts in this sutra that later monks will \"hold spurious writings to be the authentic Dharma\" and will concoct their own sutras and lyingly claim that the Buddha allows the eating of meat, whereas in fact he says he does not. A long passage in the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] shows the Buddha speaking out very forcefully against meat consumption and unequivocally in favor of vegetarianism, since the eating of the flesh of fellow sentient beings is said by him to be incompatible with the compassion that a Bodhisattva should strive to cultivate. In several other Mahayana scriptures, too (e.g., the Mahayana [[jatakas]]), the Buddha is seen clearly to indicate that meat-eating is undesirable and karmically unwholesome.\n\n==== Environment ====\nForests and jungles represented the ideal dwelling place for early Buddhists, and many texts praise the forest life as being helpful to meditation. Monks are not allowed to cut down trees as per the Vinaya, and the planting of trees and plants is seen as karmically fruitful. Because of this, Buddhist monasteries are often small nature preserves within the modernizing states in East Asia. The species [[ficus religiosa]] is seen as auspicious, because it is the same kind of tree that the Buddha gained enlightenment under.\n\nIn [[Mahayana Buddhism]], some teachings hold that trees and plants have [[Buddha nature]]. [[Kukai]] held that plants and trees, along with rocks and everything else, were manifestations of the 'One Mind' of [[Vairocana]] and [[Dogen]] held that plant life ''was'' [[Buddha nature]].\n\nIn pre-modern times, environmental issues were not widely discussed, though [[Ashoka]] banned the burning of forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken about the issue of environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that the root of the current ecological crisis is the belief that increased [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the [[Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement]] have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, there is no point in going against it. He advocates that a clean environment should be considered a basic human right and that it is our responsibility as humans to ensure that we do all we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Clean Environment Is a Human Right|url=http://www.dalailama.com/messages/environment/clean-environment/|publisher=[[14th Dalai Lama]]|date=2019-06-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Gender issues ===\n{{Main|Women in Buddhism}}\n[[File:Tibetan Nuns Volunteering Earthquake Zone.jpeg|thumb|right|225px| Buddhist nuns from the Tibetan tradition, volunteering in Kyegundo (Tibet Earthquake zone).]]\nIn pre-Buddhist Indian religion, women were seen as inferior and subservient to men. Buddha's teachings tended to promote gender equality as the Buddha held that women had the same spiritual capacities as men did. According to [[Isaline Blew Horner]], women in Buddhist India: \"commanded more respect and ranked as individuals. They enjoyed more independence, and a wider liberty to guide and follow their own lives.\"<ref>IB Horner, Women Under Primitive Buddhism, 1930, 82.</ref> Buddha gave the same teachings to both sexes, praised various female lay disciples for their wisdom and allowed women to become monastics ([[Bhikkhuni]]s) at a time when this was seen as scandalous in India, where men dominated the spiritual professions. The two chief female disciples of the Buddha were [[Khema]] and [[Uppalavanna]]. The Buddha taught that women had the same [[soteriological]] potential as men, and that gender had no influence on one's ability to advance spiritually to nirvana. In the early Buddhist texts, female enlightened [[Arhats]] are common. Buddhist nuns are however bound by an extra 8 precepts not applicable to Buddhist monks called [[The Eight Garudhammas]]. The authenticity of these rules is highly contested; they were supposedly added to the ([[bhikkhuni]]s) [[Vinaya]] \"to allow more acceptance\" of a monastic Order for women, during the Buddha's time but can be interpreted as a form of [[gender discrimination]].<ref>[http://www.dhammadharini.net/dhamma-talks-from-the-bhikkhuni-sangha/aranya-bodhi-hermitage/non-historicity-of-the-eight-garudhammas On the Apparent Non-historicity of the Eight Garudhammas Story] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103030748/http://www.dhammadharini.net/dhamma-talks-from-the-bhikkhuni-sangha/aranya-bodhi-hermitage/non-historicity-of-the-eight-garudhammas |date=November 3, 2013 }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100726221345/http://www.bhikkhuni.net/library/anaalayo-gender-discrimination-canon.html Gender Discrimination and the Pali Canon]</ref> Alan Sponberg argues that the early Buddhist sangha sought social acceptance through 'institutional [[androcentrism]]' as it was dependent on material support from lay society.

One such verses are those of the nun Soma, who was tempted by [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] when traveling in the woods. Mara states that women are not intelligent enough to attain enlightenment, Soma replies with a verse which indicates the insignificance of gender to spirituality:\n\n:\"What does womanhood matter at all\n:When the mind is concentrated well,\n:When knowledge flows on steadily\n:As one sees correctly into Dhamma.\n:One to whom it might occur,\n:'I'm a woman' or 'I'm a man'\n:Or 'I'm anything at all' \u2014\n:Is fit for Mara to address.\"<ref>Bhikkhu Bodhi, Discourses of the Ancient Nuns (Bhikkhuni-samyutta) \u00a9 1997, {{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bl143.html |title=Discourses of the Ancient Nuns: (Bhikkhuni-samyutta) |accessdate=2008-12-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420152439/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bl143.html |archivedate=2016-04-20 }}</ref>\n[[File:Haishangguanyin.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[Guan Yin of the South Sea of Sanya]] is the largest statue of a woman in the world.]]\nIn [[Mahayana Buddhism]], Bodhisattvas such as [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] and [[Guanyin]] are very popular female deities. Some [[Vajrayana|Buddhist Tantric]] texts include female consorts for each heavenly Buddha or Bodhisattva. In these Tantric couples, the female symbolizes wisdom ([[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|prajna]]) and the male symbolizes skillful means ([[upaya]]).<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 363.</ref> The union of these two qualities is often depicted as sexual union, known as [[yab-yum]] (father-mother).\n\nIn [[East Asia]], the idea of [[Buddha nature]] being inherent in all beings is taken to mean that, spiritually at least, the sexes are equal, and this is expressed by the [[\u015ar\u012bm\u0101l\u0101dev\u012b Si\u1e43han\u0101da S\u016btra|Lion's Roar of Queen Srimala sutra]]. Based on this ideal of Buddha nature, the Chinese Chan ([[Zen]]) school emphasized the equality of the sexes. [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089\u20131163) of the Chinese [[Rinzai school|Linji school]] said of women in Buddhism: \"For mastering the truth, it does not matter whether one is male or female, noble or base.\" <ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 366.</ref> The Japanese founder of [[Soto Zen]], [[Dogen]] wrote: \"If you wish to hear the Dharma and put an end to pain and turmoil, forget about such things as male and female. As long as delusions have not yet been eliminated, neither men nor women have eliminated them; when they are all eliminated and true reality is experienced, there is no distinction of male and female.\"<ref>Francis Harold Cook, Francis Dojun Cook, Eihei Dogen; How to Raise an Ox: Zen Practice as Taught in Master Dogen's Shobogenzo, page 105.</ref>\n\nThe attitude of Buddhists towards gender has been varied throughout history as it has been influenced by each particular culture and belief system such as [[Confucianism]] (which sees women as subservient) and [[Hinduism]]. The Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] (5th century CE) for example, seems to have been influenced by his [[Brahmin]] background in stating that rebirth as a male is higher than rebirth as a female.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 370.</ref> Some Mahayana sutras such as the \u2018Sutra on Changing the Female Sex\u2019 and the \u2018Questions of the Daughter Pure Faith\u2019 also echo this idea. For various historical and cultural reasons such as wars and invasions, the orders of ordained Buddhist nuns disappeared or was never introduced in Southeast Asia and Tibet, though they slowly started being reintroduced by nuns such as [[Ayya Khema]], [[Dhammananda Bhikkhuni]], [[Tenzin Palmo]] and [[Thubten Chodron]]. Until very recently, China, Taiwan and Korea were the only places where fully ordained bhiksuni lineages still existed. An international conference of Buddhist nuns was held on February 1987 at [[Bodh Gaya]] and saw the formation of 'Sakyadhita' (Daughters of the Buddha) the International Association of Buddhist Women which focuses on helping Buddhist nuns throughout the world.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 400.</ref>\n\n=== Relationships ===\nThe Buddha placed much importance on the cultivation of good will and compassion towards one's parents, spouse, friends and all other beings. Buddhism strongly values harmony in the family and community. Keeping the five precepts and having a generous attitude (Dana) is seen as the foundation for this harmony. An important text, seen as the lay people's Vinaya (code of conduct) is the [[Sigalovada Sutta]] which outlines wrong action and warns against the squandering of wealth. The [[Sigalovada Sutta]] outlines how a virtuous person \"worships the six directions\" which are parents (East), teachers (South), wife (West), and friends and colleagues (North), and the two vertical directions as: ascetics and Brahmins (Up) and the Servants (Down). The text elaborates on how to respect and support them, and how in turn the Six will return the kindness and support. The relationships are based on reciprocation, and it is understood one has no right to expect behavior from others unless one also performs good acts in their favor.\n\nParents for example, are to be respected and supported with the understanding that they are to have provided care and affection to oneself. In marriage, the sutta states that a householder should treat their wife by \"being courteous to her, by not despising her, by being faithful to her, by handing over authority to her, by providing her with adornments.\" while in return the wife \"performs her duties well, she is hospitable to relations and attendants, she is faithful, she protects what he brings, she is skilled and industrious in discharging her duties.\"<ref>Narada Thera (trans), Sigalovada Sutta: The Discourse to Sigala The Layperson's Code of Discipline, {{cite web |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.31.0.nara.html |title=Sigalovada Sutta: The Discourse to Sigala |accessdate=2012-06-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518095524/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.31.0.nara.html |archivedate=2016-05-18 }}</ref> The Buddha also stated that a wife and husband are to be each other's best friend (parama sakha). While monogamy is the predominant model for marriage, Buddhist societies have also practiced and accepted [[polygamy]] and [[polyandry]].<ref>Peter Harvey An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics Cambridge University Press 2000, page 101.</ref> Buddhism sees marriage not as sacred but as a secular partnership and hence has no issue with divorce.\n\n=== Sexuality{{anchor|Sexual misconduct}} ===\n{{Main|Buddhism and sexuality}}\nThe Third (or sometimes Fourth) of the [[Five Precepts]] of Buddhism states that one is to refrain from \"[[sexual misconduct]]\", which has various interpretations, but generally entails any sexual conduct which is harmful to others, such as rape, molestation and often adultery, although this depends on the local marriage and relationship customs. Buddhist [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s of most traditions are not only expected to refrain from all sexual activity but also take [[vows of celibacy]].\n\n==== Sexual orientation ====\n{{Main|Buddhism and sexual orientation}}\nAmong the Buddhist traditions there is a vast diversity of opinion about [[homosexuality]], and in interpreting the precedents which define \"sexual misconduct\" generally. Though there is no explicit condemnation of homosexuality in Buddhist sutras, be it [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] or [[Mantrayana]], societal and community attitudes and the historical view of practitioners have established precedents. Some ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' equate homosexuality with scriptural sexual misconduct prohibited by the [[Five Precepts]]. Other ''sangha'' hold that if sexuality is compassionate and/or consensual and does not contravene vows, then there is no karmic infraction, irrespective of whether it is same-sex or not. Buddhist communities in Western states as well as in Japan generally tend to be accepting of homosexuality. In Japan, homosexual relations among Buddhist samurai and clergy were actually quite common. Male homosexuality between clergy was especially common in the Tantric [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon school]].<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 427.</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[P\u0101li Canon]] & [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|\u0100gama]] (the Early Buddhist scriptures), there is no saying that same or opposite gender relations have anything to do with sexual misconduct,<ref name=\"cunda kammaraputta sutta\">{{cite web|title=Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta|trans-title=To Cunda the Silversmith|others=Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu|publisher=Access to Insight|year=1997|id=[[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 10.176|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.176.than.html| accessdate = 2011-03-14|quote=Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct.

According to the ancient texts this is because of the possibility that they will seduce monks or nuns.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 413.</ref>\nThe Vinaya also prevents ''[[Buddhism and sexual orientation#Pa\u1e47\u1e0dakas|pandakas]]'' from becoming monastics, which have been defined as \"without testicles\" and generally referred to those who lacked the normal (usually physical) characteristics of maleness (in some cases it refers to women who lack the normal characteristics of femaleness). This rule was established by the Buddha after a pandaka monk broke the Vinaya precepts by having relations with others. Therefore, it seems that pandakas were initially allowed into the Sangha. Later Buddhist texts like the [[Milinda Panha]] and the [[Abhidharma-kosa]] see pandakas as being spiritually hindered by their sexuality and mental defilements.\n\n=== Economic ethics ===\n[[File:Bhutan Gross National Happiness.jpg|thumb|260 px|right|[[Bhutan]]'s government promotes the concept of '[[Gross National Happiness]]' (GNH), based on Buddhist spiritual values.]]\n{{Main|Buddhist economics}}\nBuddha's teachings to laypeople included advice on how to make their living and how to use their wealth. The Buddha considered the creation of wealth to be praiseworthy, so long as it was done morally,<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 187 {{ISBN|0521556406}}</ref> in accordance with right livelihood, one of the elements of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], and which refers to making one's living without killing, being complicit in the suffering of other beings (by selling weapons, poison, alcohol or flesh) or through lying, stealing or deceit.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 188 {{ISBN|0521556406}} </ref> \n\nThe Sigalovada Sutta states that a master should look after servants and employees by: \"(1) by assigning them work according to their ability, (2) by supplying them with food and with wages, (3) by tending them in sickness, (4) by sharing with them any delicacies, (5) by granting them leave at times\" ([[Digha Nikaya]] 31). Early Buddhist texts see success in work as aided by one's spiritual and moral qualities.\n\nIn the Adiya Sutta the Buddha also outlined several ways in which people could put their 'righteously gained' wealth to use:<ref>AN 5.41, Adiya Sutta: Benefits to be Obtained (from Wealth) translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, {{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.041.than.html |title=Adiya Sutta: Benefits to be Obtained (from Wealth) |accessdate=2015-12-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420202447/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.041.than.html |archivedate=2016-04-20 }}</ref>\n#Providing 'pleasure & satisfaction' to themselves, their mother & father, their children, spouse, slaves, servants, & assistants.\n#Providing 'pleasure & satisfaction' to their friends and associates.\n#Warding off calamities coming from fire, flood, kings, thieves, or hateful heirs, and keeps himself safe.\n#Performs five oblations/offerings: to relatives, guests, the dead, kings, & devas.\n#Giving of offerings to priests ([[brahmins]]) and contemplatives (monks).\n\nThe Buddha placed much emphasis on the virtue of giving and sharing, and hence the practice of donating and charity are central to Buddhist economic ethics. Even the poor are encouraged to share, because this brings about greater spiritual wealth: \"If beings knew, as I know, the results of giving & sharing, they would not eat without having given, nor would the stain of selfishness overcome their minds. Even if it were their last bite, their last mouthful, they would not eat without having shared, if there were someone to receive their gift.\"<ref>Itivuttaka: The Group of Ones translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, {{cite web |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.1.001-027.than.html |title=Itivuttaka: The Group of Ones |accessdate=2015-12-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518095639/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.1.001-027.than.html |archivedate=2016-05-18 }}</ref> The modern growth of [[Engaged Buddhism]] has seen an emphasis on social work and charity. Buddhist aid and activist organizations include [[Buddhist Global Relief]], Lotus Outreach, [[Buddhist Peace Fellowship]], Piyarra Kutta, [[International Network of Engaged Buddhists]], The [[Tzu Chi]] Foundation, Nonviolent Peaceforce, and [[Zen Peacemakers]].\n\nBuddhist texts promote the building of public works which benefit the community and stories of Buddhist Kings like [[Ashoka]] are used as an example of lay people who promoted the public welfare by building hospitals and parks for the people. The Buddha's chief lay disciple, the rich merchant [[Anathapindika]] (\u2018Feeder of the Poor\u2019) is also another example of a virtuous layperson who donated much of his wealth for the benefit of others and was thus known as the \"foremost disciple in generosity\". Early Buddhist texts do not disparage merchants and trade, but instead promote enterprise as long as it is done ethically and leads to the well being of the community. The gold standard for rulers in Buddhism is the ideal wheel turning king, the [[Chakravartin]]. A Chakravartin is said to rule justly, giving to the needy and combating poverty so as to prevent social unrest. A Chakravartin does not fight wars for gain but only in defense of the kingdom, he accepts immigrants and refugees, and builds hospitals, parks, hostels, wells, canals and rest houses for the people and animals.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 198.</ref> [[Mahayana Buddhism]] maintains that lay Bodhisattvas should engage in social welfare activities for the good and safety of others.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 191.</ref> In the lands of Southern Buddhism, Buddhist monasteries often became places were the poor, destitute, orphaned, elderly can take shelter.

F. Schumacher]], Padmasiri De Silva, [[Prayudh Payutto]] and [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] have promoted a [[Buddhist economics]] that does not necessarily define itself as socialist but still offers a critique of modern [[consumer capitalism]]. [[E. F. Schumacher]] in his \"Buddhist economics\" (1973) wrote: \"Buddhist economics must be very different from the economics of modern materialism, since the Buddhist sees the essence of civilisation not in a multiplication of human wants but in the purification of human character.\"\n\nWhile modern economics seeks to satisfy human desires, Buddhism seeks to reduce our desires and hence Buddhist economics would tend to promote a sense of [[anti-consumerism]] and [[simple living]]. In his ''Buddhist Economics: A Middle Way for the Market Place'', [[Prayudh Payutto]] writes that consumption is only a means to an end which is 'development of human potential' and 'well being within the individual, within society and within the environment'. From a Buddhist perspective then, 'Right consumption' is based on [[well being]] while 'wrong consumption' is the need to 'satisfy the desire for pleasing sensations or ego-gratification'.<ref>Payutto, Buddhist Economics A Middle Way for the Market Place, chapter three. {{cite web|url=http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma2/becono3.html |title=Buddhist Economics...

[[Poverty]] and debt are seen as causes of suffering, immorality, and social unrest if they prevent one from having basic necessities and peace of mind. For laypeople, Buddhism promotes the middle way between a life of poverty and a materialistic or consumerist life in which one is always seeking to enrich oneself and to buy more things.<ref>Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 195.</ref> For Buddhist laypersons then, to be Buddhist does not mean to reject all material things, but, according to Sizemore and Swearer: \"it specifies an attitude to be cultivated and expressed in whatever material condition one finds oneself. To be non-attached is to possess and use material things but not to be possessed or used by them. Therefore, the idea of non-attachment applies all across Buddhist society, to laymen and monk alike.\" <ref>Russell F. Sizemore and Donald K.
