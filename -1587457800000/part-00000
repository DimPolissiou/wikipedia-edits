Later that day, Fletcher bumps into McLaren when leaving his cell, and is threatened by him. Manhandling McLaren into his cell when he's distracted, Fletcher firmly warns him over his attitude, and then talks to him when he calms down.

While conversing with Ives about the protest, Fletcher admits it was a setup between himself and McLaren - Fletcher devised it to earn his position in the library, while McLaren took part in order to gain some sympathy and support from the prison staff. McLaren soon arrives, having been given a position in the infirmary, and reveals that he and Fletcher are now friends, with both men soon making a swap for items that they want - a copy of [[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]] for a bottle of [[oil of wintergreen]].\n\n==Episode Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
