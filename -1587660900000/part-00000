Adventists are opposed to the formulation of [[creed]]s, so the 28 fundamental beliefs are considered ''descriptors'', not ''prescriptors''; that is, that they describe the official position of the church but are not criteria for membership. These beliefs were originally known as the '''27 fundamental beliefs''' when adopted by the church's [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|General Conference]] in 1999 additional belief (number 11) was added in 2005.<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://news.adventist.org/specials/2005/gcsession/voted_docs/growinginchrist.html \n |title=Growing in Christ \n |accessdate=2006-05-26 \n |date=2005-07-04 \n |publisher=[[Adventist News Network]] \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129114541/http://news.adventist.org/specials/2005/gcsession/voted_docs/growinginchrist.html \n |archivedate=2005-11-29 \n |url-status=dead \n |df= \n}}</ref> The ''Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary'' is a significant expression of Adventist theological thought.\n\nThey may be grouped into the doctrines of God, humanity, salvation, the church, Christian life, and the restoration.<ref>[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html Seventh-day Adventist Church] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310104717/http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html |date=2006-03-10 }} Fundamental Beliefs</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Prose|section|small=left|date=December 2017}}\n[[Image:SDAs believe.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Seventh-day Adventists Believe'' (2nd edition 2005), official publication explaining the fundamental beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist church.]]\nAdventists have historically been reluctant to formalize a creed.

Holy Scriptures\n:\"The Holy Scriptures are the [[Biblical infallibility|infallible]] revelation of [God's] will.\" Adventist theologians generally reject the \"verbal inspiration\" position on Scripture held by many conservative [[evangelical Christians]]. They believe instead that God inspired the thoughts of the biblical authors, and that the authors then expressed these thoughts in their own words.<ref>{{harvnb|General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|2005|pp=14\u201316}}</ref> This view is popularly known as \"thought inspiration\", and most Adventist members hold to that view.

Trinity\n:The Godhead (Trinity) consists of the Eternal Father, the Lord Jesus the Christ, and the Holy Spirit.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Knight|editor-first=George|title=Seventh-day Adventists Answer Questions on Doctrine (Annotated edition)|year=2003|publisher=Andrews University Press|location=Berrien Springs, Michigan|ref=harv|page=5}}</ref>\n\n3. Father\n:God, the Eternal Father, is a personal and spiritual Being, who is omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient. He is infinite in wisdom and love.<ref>{{harvnb|Knight|2003|p=5}}</ref>\n\n4. Son\n:Jesus, the Christ, is God in verity. He is of the same nature and essence as the Eternal Father. In addition, he took upon Himself human nature, living as a righteous man on earth, dying for the sins of mankind, raised from the dead and ascended to heaven where he makes intercession for mankind.<ref>{{harvnb|Knght|2003|p=5}}</ref>\n\n5. Holy Spirit\n:God the eternal Spirit was active with the Father and the Son in Creation, incarnation, and redemption. He is as much a person as are the Father and the Son. He inspired the writers of Scripture. He filled Christ\u2019s life with power. He draws and convicts human beings; and those who respond He renews and transforms into the image of God. Sent by the Father and the Son to be always with His children, He extends spiritual gifts to the church, empowers it to bear witness to Christ, and in harmony with the Scriptures leads it into all truth.

Creation\n:The Seventh-day Adventist doctrine of creationism is based on believing that the opening chapters of Genesis should be interpreted as literal history. Adventist belief holds that all Earthly life originated during a six-day period some 6000 years ago, and a global flood destroyed all land based animals and humans except for those saved on Noah's Ark. Adventists oppose theories which propose interpreting the days of creation symbolically.<ref>{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|p=90}}</ref> \n\n:Although Adventists hold that creation week was a recent event, they believe the Bible speaks of other worlds populted by intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, which pre-existed the Earth's creation week.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grisda.org/earth-antedated-by-other-created-worlds|title=Earth Antedated by Other Created Worlds, Ellen White Statements|last=White|first= Ellen|date=September 29, 2014|ref=harv}}</ref> Instead of being ''The Word's'' first creation, the Earth was most likely His last one.

That the Holy Spirit is a personal being, sharing the attributes of deity with the Father and the Son.\n:6. That Christ, the Word of God, became [[incarnation (Christianity)|incarnate]] through the miraculous conception and the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]]; and that He lived an absolutely sinless life here on earth.\n:7. That the [[substitutionary atonement|vicarious, atoning death]] of Jesus Christ, once for all, is all-sufficient for the redemption of a lost race.\n:8.

That He now serves as our advocate in priestly ministry and mediation before the Father.\n:11. That He will return in a premillennial, personal, imminent second advent.\n:12. That man was [[creation myth|created]] sinless, but by his subsequent fall entered a state of alienation and depravity.\n:13. That salvation through Christ is by grace alone, through faith in His blood.\n:14. That entrance upon the new life in Christ is by regeneration, or the new birth.\n:15. That man is [[justification (theology)|justified by faith]].\n:16. That man is sanctified by the indwelling Christ through the Holy Spirit.\n:17. That man will be glorified at the [[resurrection of the dead|resurrection or translation of the saints]], when the [[second coming|Lord returns]].\n:18.

Holy Scriptures\n:\"The Holy Scriptures are the [[Biblical infallibility|infallible]] revelation of [God's] will.\" Adventist theologians generally reject the \"verbal inspiration\" position on Scripture held by many conservative [[evangelical Christians]]. They believe instead that God inspired the thoughts of the biblical authors, and that the authors then expressed these thoughts in their own words.<ref>{{harvnb|General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|2005|pp=14\u201316}}</ref> This view is popularly known as \"thought inspiration\", and most Adventist members hold to that view.

Father\n:God, the Eternal Father, is a personal and spiritual Being, who is omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient. He is infinite in wisdom and love.<ref>{{harvnb|Knight|2003|p=5}}</ref>\n\n4. Son\n:Jesus, the Christ, is God in verity. He is of the same nature and essence as the Eternal Father. In addition, he took upon Himself human nature, living as a righteous man on earth, dying for the sins of mankind, raised from the dead and ascended to heaven where he makes intercession for mankind.<ref>{{harvnb|Knght|2003|p=5}}</ref>\n\n5. Holy Spirit\n:God the eternal Spirit was active with the Father and the Son in Creation, incarnation, and redemption. He is as much a person as are the Father and the Son. He inspired the writers of Scripture. He filled Christ\u2019s life with power. He draws and convicts human beings; and those who respond He renews and transforms into the image of God. Sent by the Father and the Son to be always with His children, He extends spiritual gifts to the church, empowers it to bear witness to Christ, and in harmony with the Scriptures leads it into all truth.

Creation\n:The Seventh-day Adventist doctrine of creationism is based on believing that the opening chapters of Genesis should be interpreted as literal history. Adventist belief holds that all Earthly life originated during a six-day period some 6000 years ago, and a global flood destroyed all land based animals and humans except for those saved on Noah's Ark. Adventists oppose theories which propose interpreting the days of creation symbolically.<ref>{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|p=90}}</ref> \n\n:Although Adventists hold that creation week was a recent event, they believe the Bible speaks of other worlds populted by intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, which pre-existed the Earth's creation week.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grisda.org/earth-antedated-by-other-created-worlds|title=Earth Antedated by Other Created Worlds, Ellen White Statements|last=White|first= Ellen|date=September 29, 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>  Instead of being ''The Word's'' first creation, the Earth was most likely His last one.

That Christ, the Word of God, became [[incarnation (Christianity)|incarnate]] through the miraculous conception and the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]]; and that He lived an absolutely sinless life here on earth.\n:7. That the [[substitutionary atonement|vicarious, atoning death]] of Jesus Christ, once for all, is all-sufficient for the redemption of a lost race.\n:8.

That He now serves as our advocate in priestly ministry and mediation before the Father.\n:11. That He will return in a premillennial, personal, imminent second advent.\n:12. That man was [[creation myth|created]] sinless, but by his subsequent fall entered a state of alienation and depravity.\n:13. That salvation through Christ is by grace alone, through faith in His blood.\n:14. That entrance upon the new life in Christ is by regeneration, or the new birth.\n:15. That man is [[justification (theology)|justified by faith]].\n:16. That man is sanctified by the indwelling Christ through the Holy Spirit.\n:17. That man will be glorified at the [[resurrection of the dead|resurrection or translation of the saints]], when the [[second coming|Lord returns]].\n:18.

The regulations also included a loophole where rapid approval can be made internally without independent approval but with a three day expiry and with subsequent review by the independent body.

It has 150 seats which are filled through [[Elections in the Netherlands|elections]] using a [[party-list proportional representation]]. It sits in the [[Binnenhof]] in [[The Hague]].\n\n==Name==\nAlthough this body is called the \"House of Representatives\" in English, this is not a direct translation of its Dutch name, the \"Second Chamber\" or more colloquially just the \"Chamber\". Rather than \"representatives\" (''afgevaardigden''), members of the House are referred to as ''Tweede Kamerlid'' (\"member of the Second Chamber\").\n\nAalissa from Urban Academy Charter School is a hoe she likes other girls mans she can't fight and her hair was the reason animals a going extinct lord Jesus help bless her with so miricle drops please and thank you\n\n==Elections==\nThe normal term of the House of Representatives is four years. Elections are called when the government loses parliament's confidence, the governing coalition breaks down, the term of the House of Representatives expires or when no governing coalition can be formed.\n\n===Parties===\n{{main|Political parties of the Netherlands}}\nAnybody eligible to vote in the Netherlands also has the right to establish a [[political party]] and contest elections for the House of Representatives. Parties wanting to take part must register 43 days before the elections, supplying a nationwide list of at most 50 candidates (80 if the party already has more than 15 seats). Parties that do not have any sitting candidates in the House of Representatives must also pay a deposit (11,250 euro for the November 2006 elections, for all districts together) and provide 30 signatures of support from residents of each of the 20 electoral districts in which they want to collect votes.\n\n===Party lists===\nThe candidate lists are placed in the hands of the voters at least 14 days before the election. Each candidate list is numbered, with the person in the first position known as the ''[[lijsttrekker]]'' (\"list puller\"). The lijsttrekker is usually appointed by the party to lead its election campaign, and is almost always the party's political leader and candidate for [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]]. Parties may choose to compete with different candidate lists in each of the 20 electoral districts, but as seats are allocated on national rather than district level, most parties have almost identical lists in all districts with candidates running nationwide. Only large parties usually have some regional candidates at the bottom of their lists. From 1973 until abolition in June 2017 it was possible for two or more parties to combine their separate lists to increase the chance of winning a remainder seat. This was known as a '[[list combination]]' or ''Lijstverbinding'' / ''lijstencombinatie''.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/fenomeen-politieke-lijstverbinding-sneuvelt-in-eerste-kamer~a4501654/ | title=Fenomeen politieke lijstverbinding sneuvelt in Eerste Kamer | author=Gijs Herdersche\u00ea | date=20 June 2017 | publisher=Volkskrant}}</ref>\n\n===Registration and voting===\nCitizens of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] aged 18 or over have the right to vote, with the exception of 1) prisoners serving a term of more than one year 2) those who have been declared incapable by court because of insanity 3) residents of Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten, unless they have spent ten years residing in the Netherlands or work for the Dutch civil service.<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.kiesraad.nl/verkiezingen/tweede-kamer/stemmen/kiesgerechtigdheid | title=Kiesgerechtigdheid | publisher=Government of the Netherlands | accessdate=December 2, 2018}}</ref> Eligible citizens resident in the Netherlands are able to vote if they are registered on a municipal population register (''Basisregistratie Personen''). Eligible citizens outside the Netherlands can permanently register to vote at the municipality of [[The Hague]], provided they have a current Dutch passport or identity card.\n\nA single vote can be placed on any one candidate. Many voters select one of the lijsttrekkers ([[Jan Peter Balkenende]], for example, received 2,198,114 of the CDA's 2,608,573 votes in the November 2006 elections), but alternatively a preference vote may be made for a candidate lower down the list.\n\n===Allocation of seats===\n[[File:The Hague car-free city-centre 31.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Exterior of the House of Representatives]]\nOnce the election results are known, the seats are allocated to the parties. The number of valid national votes cast is divided by 150, the number of seats available, to give a threshold for each seat (the ''kiesdeler''); 1/150th is approximately 0.67% of the valid votes. Each party's number of votes is divided by this threshold, and rounded down to the nearest whole number, to give an initial number of seats equal to the number of times the threshold was reached.<ref name=\"wetten.nl 2019\">{{cite web | title=Kieswet, Hoofdstuk P | website=wetten.nl | date=2019-02-22 | url=https://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0004627&afdeling=II&hoofdstuk=P&z=2019-02-22&g=2019-02-22 | language=nl | access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref> Any party that received fewer votes than the threshold fails to gain representation in the House of Representatives. After the initial seats are allocated, the remainder seats are allocated among the parties that received at least one seat, using the [[D'Hondt method]] of largest averages. This system slightly favours the larger parties. Since parties that received fewer votes than required to obtain one whole seat are not eligible for remainder seats, there is a de facto [[election threshold]] of 0.67%.<ref name=\"Kiesraad.nl 2016\">{{cite web | title=Kiesdrempel, kiesdeler en voorkeurdrempel | website=Kiesraad.nl | date=2016-04-22 | url=https://www.kiesraad.nl/verkiezingen/tweede-kamer/uitslagen/kiesdrempel-kiesdeler-en-voorkeurdrempel | language=nl | access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref> This threshold is one of the lowest for national parliaments in the world, and there are usually multiple parties winning seats with 2% or less of the vote. Any party that did not have seats in the House at the time of the election will have its deposit refunded if it receives more than 75% of the threshold (1/200th of the vote).\n\nOnce the number of seats allocated to each party is known, in general they are allocated to candidates in the order that they appear on the party's list. (Hence, before the elections, the candidates near the top may be described as in an electable position, depending on the number of seats that the party is likely to obtain.) At this stage, however, the preference votes are also taken into account. Any candidate receiving more than one quarter of the threshold on personal preference votes (the 'preference threshold' or ''voorkeursdrempel'', 0.1675% of the total number of valid votes), is considered elected in their own right, leapfrogging candidates higher on the list. In the November 2006 elections, only one candidate received a seat exclusively through preference votes, while 26 other candidates reaching the preference threshold were already elected based on their position on the list. If a candidate cannot take up the position in parliament (e.g., if they become a [[Political minister|minister]], decide not to enter parliament, or later resign) then the next candidate on the list takes their place.\n\n===Formation of governing coalition===\nAfter all seats are allocated, a series of negotiations take place in order to form a government that, usually, commands a majority in the chamber. Since 2012, the House of Representatives appoints a \"scout\" to ask the major party leaders about prospective coalitions. On the basis of the scout's interviews, the House of Representatives then appoints an [[Cabinet of the Netherlands#Formation|informateur]], who checks out possible coalitions, and [[Cabinet of the Netherlands#Formation|formateur]], who leads negotiations (in previous years the informateur and formateur were appointed by the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|monarch]]). It typically takes a few months before the formateur is ready to accept a royal invitation to form a government and become prime minister. All cabinet members must resign from parliament, as the constitution does not allow a cabinet member to hold a seat in the House of Representatives.\n\nDue to the nationwide party-list system and the low election threshold, a typical House of Representatives has ten or more factions represented. Such fragmentation makes it nearly impossible for one party to win the 76 seats needed for a majority in the House of Representatives. Indeed, since the current party-list proportional representation system was introduced in 1918, no party has even approached the number of seats that are even theoretically needed to govern alone, let alone win enough for an outright majority. The highest proportion of seats won by a single party since then has been 54 out of 150, obtained by the CDA in 1986 and 1989. Between 1891 and 1897, the [[Liberal Union (Netherlands)|Liberal Union]] was the last party to have an absolute majority of seats in the House of Representatives. All Dutch cabinets since then have been coalitions of two or more parties.\n\n==House of Representatives offices==\nThe buildings that house the individual offices of the Members of the House of Representatives and conference rooms for closed-door party meetings are all located on the [[Binnenhof]]. The main buildings of the old [[Ministry of Justice and Security (Netherlands)|Ministry of Justice]] and Ministry of Colonial Affairs are used as accommodations.\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Den Haag - Plein 2a.JPG|The old Ministry of Justice building\nFile:Den Haag - Plein 1.JPG|The old Ministry of Colonial Affairs building\nFile:Rm17532.JPG|Grand Hotel Central building\nFile:Binnenhof, The Hague 1828.jpg|Binnenhof Building C\nFile:Binnenhof, The Hague 1873.jpg|Binnenhof Building 1A\n</gallery>\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-5}}\n* Old Ministry of Justice building:\n** [[Christian Democratic Appeal]]\n** [[Democrats 66]]\n** [[Forum for Democracy (Netherlands)|Forum for Democracy]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/04/06/nieuwkomers-denk-en-forum-krijgen-geen-andere-plek-in-zaal-tweede-kamer-7959181-a1553388|title=Nieuwkomers Denk en Forum krijgen geen andere plek in zaal Tweede Kamer|date=2017-04-06|accessdate=2017-11-04|work=NRC Handelsblad|language=nl}}</ref>\n{{Col-5}}\n* Old Ministry of Colonial Affairs building:\n** [[GroenLinks]]\n** [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ad.nl/politiek/verhuizing-kamer-lastige-puzzel-door-eisen-kleine-partijen~a38aea52/|title=Verhuizing Kamer lastige puzzel door eisen kleine partijen|date=2017-04-07|accessdate=2017-11-04|work=Algemeen Dagblad|language=nl}}</ref>\n** [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]]\n** [[Party for the Animals]]\n{{Col-5}}\n* Grand Hotel Central:\n** [[Party for Freedom]]\n** [[50PLUS]]\n{{Col-5}}\n* Binnenhof Building C:\n** [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]]\n** [[Reformed Political Party]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/06/02/reken-niet-zomaar-op-de-sgp-10889477-a1561532|title=\u2018Reken niet zomaar op de SGP\u2019|date=2017-06-02|accessdate=2017-11-04|work=NRC Handelsblad|language=nl}}</ref>\n** [[Denk (political party)|Denk]]\n{{Col-5}}\n* Binnenhof Building 1A:\n** [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/03/21/pijnlijk-gepuzzel-aan-het-binnenhof-7490966-a1551246|title=Partijen onderhandelen over werkplek - wie eindigt op zolder?|date=2017-03-21|accessdate=2017-11-04|work=NRC Handelsblad|language=nl}}</ref>\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Composition==\n===Historical compositions===\n{{Main|Historic composition of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Dutchparlseats2.png|thumb|Representation per party, between 1946 and 2018]]\n\nUntil 1956, there were 100 seats. This was expanded to 150 seats, which is the current number.\n\nTo give an overview of the history of the House of Representatives, the figure on the right shows the seat distribution in the House from the first general elections after World War II (1946) to the current situation. The left-wing parties are towards the bottom, the Christian parties in the centre, with the right-wing parties towards the top. Occasionally, single-issue (or narrow-focus) parties have arisen, and these are shown at the extreme top. Vertical lines indicate general elections. Although these are generally held every four years, the resulting coalition governments do not always finish their term without a government crisis, which is often followed by fresh elections. Hence the frequent periods shorter than four years.\n\n===Current situation===\n{{Main|List of members of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands, 2017\u2013present}}\n\nThe [[2017 Dutch general election|Dutch general election of 2017]] was held on Wednesday, 15 March 2017, and followed the call for new elections after the [[Second Rutte cabinet]] had completed its four-year term. The new Members of the House of Representatives were installed on 23 March 2017. Four parties were required to form a coalition with a simple majority (76 seats). Rutte's [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]], as well as the [[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]], [[Democrats 66|D66]] and [[ChristianUnion|CU]] parties, later agreed to form a governing coalition with the required one-seat majority after the longest time since an election took place, 209 days, surpassing the previous record of 208 days set after the [[1977 Dutch general election|1977 general elections]].\n\n{{Politics of the Netherlands}}\n{{Dutch general election, 2017}}\n\n==Parliamentary leaders==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"

Kamer}}'', literally '''Second Chamber''') is the [[lower house]] of the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]] of the [[Netherlands]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], the other one being the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]]. It has 150 seats which are filled through [[Elections in the Netherlands|elections]] using a [[party-list proportional representation]]. It sits in the [[Binnenhof]] in [[The Hague]].\n\n==Name==\nAlthough this body is called the \"House of Representatives\" in English, this is not a direct translation of its Dutch name, the \"Second Chamber\" or more colloquially just the \"Chamber\". Rather than \"representatives\" (''afgevaardigden''), members of the House are referred to as ''Tweede Kamerlid'' (\"member of the Second Chamber\").\n\n==Functions==\nThe House of Representatives is the main chamber of the States General, where discussion of proposed [[legislation]] and review of the actions of the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|cabinet]] takes place. Both the Cabinet and the House of Representatives itself have the right to propose legislation; the House of Representatives discusses it and, if adopted by a majority, sends it on to the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]]. Review of the actions of the cabinet takes the form of formal interrogations, which may result in [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] urging the cabinet to take, or refrain from, certain actions. No individual may be a member of both parliament and cabinet, except in a [[cabinet of the Netherlands#Formation|caretaker]] cabinet that has not yet been succeeded when a new House is sworn in.\n\nThe House of Representatives is also responsible for the first round of selection for [[judge]]s to the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands]]. It submits a list of three names for every vacant position to the Government. Furthermore, it elects the Dutch [[Ombudsman#Netherlands|Ombudsman]] and their subsidiaries.\n\n==Elections==\nThe normal term of the House of Representatives is four years. Elections are called when the government loses parliament's confidence, the governing coalition breaks down, the term of the House of Representatives expires or when no governing coalition can be formed.\n\n===Parties===\n{{main|Political parties of the Netherlands}}\nAnybody eligible to vote in the Netherlands also has the right to establish a [[political party]] and contest elections for the House of Representatives. Parties wanting to take part must register 43 days before the elections, supplying a nationwide list of at most 50 candidates (80 if the party already has more than 15 seats). Parties that do not have any sitting candidates in the House of Representatives must also pay a deposit (11,250 euro for the November 2006 elections, for all districts together) and provide 30 signatures of support from residents of each of the 20 electoral districts in which they want to collect votes.\n\n===Party lists===\nThe candidate lists are placed in the hands of the voters at least 14 days before the election. Each candidate list is numbered, with the person in the first position known as the ''[[lijsttrekker]]'' (\"list puller\"). The lijsttrekker is usually appointed by the party to lead its election campaign, and is almost always the party's political leader and candidate for [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]]. Parties may choose to compete with different candidate lists in each of the 20 electoral districts, but as seats are allocated on national rather than district level, most parties have almost identical lists in all districts with candidates running nationwide. Only large parties usually have some regional candidates at the bottom of their lists. From 1973 until abolition in June 2017 it was possible for two or more parties to combine their separate lists to increase the chance of winning a remainder seat. This was known as a '[[list combination]]' or ''Lijstverbinding'' / ''lijstencombinatie''.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/fenomeen-politieke-lijstverbinding-sneuvelt-in-eerste-kamer~a4501654/ | title=Fenomeen politieke lijstverbinding sneuvelt in Eerste Kamer | author=Gijs Herdersche\u00ea | date=20 June 2017 | publisher=Volkskrant}}</ref>\n\n===Registration and voting===\nCitizens of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] aged 18 or over have the right to vote, with the exception of 1) prisoners serving a term of more than one year 2) those who have been declared incapable by court because of insanity 3) residents of Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten, unless they have spent ten years residing in the Netherlands or work for the Dutch civil service.<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.kiesraad.nl/verkiezingen/tweede-kamer/stemmen/kiesgerechtigdheid | title=Kiesgerechtigdheid | publisher=Government of the Netherlands | accessdate=December 2, 2018}}</ref> Eligible citizens resident in the Netherlands are able to vote if they are registered on a municipal population register (''Basisregistratie Personen''). Eligible citizens outside the Netherlands can permanently register to vote at the municipality of [[The Hague]], provided they have a current Dutch passport or identity card.\n\nA single vote can be placed on any one candidate. Many voters select one of the lijsttrekkers ([[Jan Peter Balkenende]], for example, received 2,198,114 of the CDA's 2,608,573 votes in the November 2006 elections), but alternatively a preference vote may be made for a candidate lower down the list.\n\n===Allocation of seats===\n[[File:The Hague car-free city-centre 31.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Exterior of the House of Representatives]]\nOnce the election results are known, the seats are allocated to the parties. The number of valid national votes cast is divided by 150, the number of seats available, to give a threshold for each seat (the ''kiesdeler''); 1/150th is approximately 0.67% of the valid votes. Each party's number of votes is divided by this threshold, and rounded down to the nearest whole number, to give an initial number of seats equal to the number of times the threshold was reached.<ref name=\"wetten.nl 2019\">{{cite web | title=Kieswet, Hoofdstuk P | website=wetten.nl | date=2019-02-22 | url=https://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0004627&afdeling=II&hoofdstuk=P&z=2019-02-22&g=2019-02-22 | language=nl | access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref> Any party that received fewer votes than the threshold fails to gain representation in the House of Representatives. After the initial seats are allocated, the remainder seats are allocated among the parties that received at least one seat, using the [[D'Hondt method]] of largest averages. This system slightly favours the larger parties. Since parties that received fewer votes than required to obtain one whole seat are not eligible for remainder seats, there is a de facto [[election threshold]] of 0.67%.<ref name=\"Kiesraad.nl 2016\">{{cite web | title=Kiesdrempel, kiesdeler en voorkeurdrempel | website=Kiesraad.nl | date=2016-04-22 | url=https://www.kiesraad.nl/verkiezingen/tweede-kamer/uitslagen/kiesdrempel-kiesdeler-en-voorkeurdrempel | language=nl | access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref> This threshold is one of the lowest for national parliaments in the world, and there are usually multiple parties winning seats with 2% or less of the vote. Any party that did not have seats in the House at the time of the election will have its deposit refunded if it receives more than 75% of the threshold (1/200th of the vote).\n\nOnce the number of seats allocated to each party is known, in general they are allocated to candidates in the order that they appear on the party's list. (Hence, before the elections, the candidates near the top may be described as in an electable position, depending on the number of seats that the party is likely to obtain.) At this stage, however, the preference votes are also taken into account. Any candidate receiving more than one quarter of the threshold on personal preference votes (the 'preference threshold' or ''voorkeursdrempel'', 0.1675% of the total number of valid votes), is considered elected in their own right, leapfrogging candidates higher on the list. In the November 2006 elections, only one candidate received a seat exclusively through preference votes, while 26 other candidates reaching the preference threshold were already elected based on their position on the list. If a candidate cannot take up the position in parliament (e.g., if they become a [[Political minister|minister]], decide not to enter parliament, or later resign) then the next candidate on the list takes their place.\n\n===Formation of governing coalition===\nAfter all seats are allocated, a series of negotiations take place in order to form a government that, usually, commands a majority in the chamber. Since 2012, the House of Representatives appoints a \"scout\" to ask the major party leaders about prospective coalitions. On the basis of the scout's interviews, the House of Representatives then appoints an [[Cabinet of the Netherlands#Formation|informateur]], who checks out possible coalitions, and [[Cabinet of the Netherlands#Formation|formateur]], who leads negotiations (in previous years the informateur and formateur were appointed by the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|monarch]]). It typically takes a few months before the formateur is ready to accept a royal invitation to form a government and become prime minister. All cabinet members must resign from parliament, as the constitution does not allow a cabinet member to hold a seat in the House of Representatives.\n\nDue to the nationwide party-list system and the low election threshold, a typical House of Representatives has ten or more factions represented. Such fragmentation makes it nearly impossible for one party to win the 76 seats needed for a majority in the House of Representatives. Indeed, since the current party-list proportional representation system was introduced in 1918, no party has even approached the number of seats that are even theoretically needed to govern alone, let alone win enough for an outright majority. The highest proportion of seats won by a single party since then has been 54 out of 150, obtained by the CDA in 1986 and 1989. Between 1891 and 1897, the [[Liberal Union (Netherlands)|Liberal Union]] was the last party to have an absolute majority of seats in the House of Representatives. All Dutch cabinets since then have been coalitions of two or more parties.\n\n==House of Representatives offices==\nThe buildings that house the individual offices of the Members of the House of Representatives and conference rooms for closed-door party meetings are all located on the [[Binnenhof]]. The main buildings of the old [[Ministry of Justice and Security (Netherlands)|Ministry of Justice]] and Ministry of Colonial Affairs are used as accommodations.\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Den Haag - Plein 2a.JPG|The old Ministry of Justice building\nFile:Den Haag - Plein 1.JPG|The old Ministry of Colonial Affairs building\nFile:Rm17532.JPG|Grand Hotel Central building\nFile:Binnenhof, The Hague 1828.jpg|Binnenhof Building C\nFile:Binnenhof, The Hague 1873.jpg|Binnenhof Building 1A\n</gallery>\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-5}}\n* Old Ministry of Justice building:\n** [[Christian Democratic Appeal]]\n** [[Democrats 66]]\n** [[Forum for Democracy (Netherlands)|Forum for Democracy]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/04/06/nieuwkomers-denk-en-forum-krijgen-geen-andere-plek-in-zaal-tweede-kamer-7959181-a1553388|title=Nieuwkomers Denk en Forum krijgen geen andere plek in zaal Tweede Kamer|date=2017-04-06|accessdate=2017-11-04|work=NRC Handelsblad|language=nl}}</ref>\n{{Col-5}}\n* Old Ministry of Colonial Affairs building:\n** [[GroenLinks]]\n** [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ad.nl/politiek/verhuizing-kamer-lastige-puzzel-door-eisen-kleine-partijen~a38aea52/|title=Verhuizing Kamer lastige puzzel door eisen kleine partijen|date=2017-04-07|accessdate=2017-11-04|work=Algemeen Dagblad|language=nl}}</ref>\n** [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]]\n** [[Party for the Animals]]\n{{Col-5}}\n* Grand Hotel Central:\n** [[Party for Freedom]]\n** [[50PLUS]]\n{{Col-5}}\n* Binnenhof Building C:\n** [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]]\n** [[Reformed Political Party]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/06/02/reken-niet-zomaar-op-de-sgp-10889477-a1561532|title=\u2018Reken niet zomaar op de SGP\u2019|date=2017-06-02|accessdate=2017-11-04|work=NRC Handelsblad|language=nl}}</ref>\n** [[Denk (political party)|Denk]]\n{{Col-5}}\n* Binnenhof Building 1A:\n** [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/03/21/pijnlijk-gepuzzel-aan-het-binnenhof-7490966-a1551246|title=Partijen onderhandelen over werkplek - wie eindigt op zolder?|date=2017-03-21|accessdate=2017-11-04|work=NRC Handelsblad|language=nl}}</ref>\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Composition==\n===Historical compositions===\n{{Main|Historic composition of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Dutchparlseats2.png|thumb|Representation per party, between 1946 and 2018]]\n\nUntil 1956, there were 100 seats. This was expanded to 150 seats, which is the current number.\n\nTo give an overview of the history of the House of Representatives, the figure on the right shows the seat distribution in the House from the first general elections after World War II (1946) to the current situation. The left-wing parties are towards the bottom, the Christian parties in the centre, with the right-wing parties towards the top. Occasionally, single-issue (or narrow-focus) parties have arisen, and these are shown at the extreme top. Vertical lines indicate general elections. Although these are generally held every four years, the resulting coalition governments do not always finish their term without a government crisis, which is often followed by fresh elections. Hence the frequent periods shorter than four years.\n\n===Current situation===\n{{Main|List of members of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands, 2017\u2013present}}\n\nThe [[2017 Dutch general election|Dutch general election of 2017]] was held on Wednesday, 15 March 2017, and followed the call for new elections after the [[Second Rutte cabinet]] had completed its four-year term. The new Members of the House of Representatives were installed on 23 March 2017. Four parties were required to form a coalition with a simple majority (76 seats). Rutte's [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]], as well as the [[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]], [[Democrats 66|D66]] and [[ChristianUnion|CU]] parties, later agreed to form a governing coalition with the required one-seat majority after the longest time since an election took place, 209 days, surpassing the previous record of 208 days set after the [[1977 Dutch general election|1977 general elections]].\n\n{{Politics of the Netherlands}}\n{{Dutch general election, 2017}}\n\n==Parliamentary leaders==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"

They received a well deserved recognition award from the FA for 125 years of playing football during 2011. \nThe early years of their existence were spent in the Wimbledon and Sutton leagues before moving on to the Surrey Intermediate League (Southern Division). Much later, during the late 1960s and early 1970s, the club were members of the Surrey Senior League for a short time, playing in the newly formed division one where they won the league title in 1969/70. The reserves won their division in 1970/71 going undefeated. \nOver the years, \u201cThe Wood\u201d have reached a number of Surrey FA Cup Finals. In 1988/89 they lost 1-2 to Bradbank Sports in the Intermediate Cup Final. In 1991/92 they beat Woking & Horsell 4\u20130 in the final of the same competition. The reserves reached the final of the 1988/89 and 1989/90 Lower Junior Cup but were beaten on both occasions. \nThe local recreation ground limited the progress of the club due to the basic facilities and a search for a new ground was launched. Adequate facilities were found at Wibbandune Sports Ground in 1991 and the ground has steadily improved since then. \n2001/2 saw the club enter the Surrey County Senior League where they finished a creditable 5th. The following season, they finished as runners up. \nIn 2002/3, the league amalgamated with the Combined Counties League and the club were founder members of the new division 1 where they finished as runners up and were promoted to the Premier Division. \nThey have continued to improve. In 2004/5, they finished 14th of the 24 clubs. The following season, they finished fourth and had a fine FA Vase run, beating Chichester City United, Raynes Park Vale and Greenwich Borough, before losing to VCD Athletic in the 2nd round proper. \nIn 2006/7 they entered the FA Cup for the first time, defeating Chipstead after a replay before succumbing to Worthing 0\u20133. \nAfter a brief ground share at Croydon FC, the club moved back to Wibbandune where ground improvements included the addition of excellent flood-lighting, a new covered terrace and a 120-seat stand. In March 2012, the club added a new away team changing room, new spectator ground lavatories and relaid the entire playing surface including drainage thanks to a \u00a371,000 grant from the Football Association. They also reached the 2011/12 final of the League Cup at Farnborough FC on 4 May v Guernsey FC in front of 667 spectators, which they lost 0-2 after extra time, becoming the first club to keep a 90-minute clean sheet against The Islanders. Following a second renovation of the pitch in April, the club returned to Wibbandune in July 2013 and the under 18 youth section was restarted.\n\nIn 2014/15, Wood reached the FA Vase 4th round (last 32 nationally) and the Surrey Senior Cup quarter finals for the first time in their history. They reached the final of the League Cup once again in 2014/15 but, once again, they lost in extra time, this time 1-2 to Camberley Town in front of 385 spectators at Woking FC. Wood reached the Surrey FA Senior Cup quarter finals for only the second time in 2017/18.\n\nOn March 8, 2016, the club were awarded the FA Charter Standard accreditation by the Football Association.\n\nThe club won the CCL Sportsmanship Award for 2015/16 having received just 32 cautions throughout the season.\n\nIn 2020, the club installed new ground perimeter fencing and a new pitch rail in line with current ground gradings. Further ground improvements are planned in the near future.\n\n==Ground==\n\nColliers Wood United play their home games at Wibbandune Sports Ground, A3 Southbound, Opposite 199\u2013213 Robin Hood Way, Wimbledon, SW20 0AA.\n\nThe ground has a 102-seater covered stand.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pieman |first=Simple |url=http://pieandmushypeas.blogspot.co.uk/2007/05/colliers-wood-united.html |title=Pie and Mushy Peas: Colliers Wood United FC |publisher=Pieandmushypeas.blogspot.co.uk |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref> Funding was granted for work to be carried out in installing a drainage system under the pitch for the 2012-13 season, which resulted in the club playing some of its home games at [[Cobham F.C.|Cobham]] that season.<ref name=\"worldghop\">{{cite web|last=Bernard |first=Rob |url=http://worldgroundhoptwo.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/colliers-wood-united.html |title=Hopping all over the World Two: Colliers Wood United |publisher=Worldgroundhoptwo.blogspot.co.uk |date=2011-06-03 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sitatrust.org.uk/projects/football-pitch-upgrading |title=Football Pitch Upgrading at Wibbandune Sports Ground |publisher=SITA Trust |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n\n===League honours===\n*'''[[Combined Counties Football League]] Division One'''<ref name=\"fchd\">{{fchd|name=COLLIERS WOOD UNITED|id=COLLIEWU}}</ref>\n**Runners up: 2003\u201304\n*'''[[Surrey County Senior League|Surrey County Premier League]]'''<ref name=\"fchd2\">{{fchd|id=VANDYKCU|name=VANDYKE COLLIERS UNITED}}</ref><ref name=\"fchd\"/>\n**Champions: 1997\u201398\n**Runners up: 1999\u201300, 2000\u201301, 2002\u201303\n*'''Surrey Senior League Division One'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spanglefish.com/collierswoodunitedfc/index.asp?pageid=365974 |title=Colliers Wood United FC &#124;

The subcontinent's long and diverse history has given it a unique eclectic culture. It is often associated with spirituality. Thanks to its history of both indigenous and foreign influences - like the ancient Indian religions ([[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]) and the ancient Middle East Asian schools of thought (Abrahamic - [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] etc.) - the current Indian civilizational psyche is evolving into a complex mix of them - sometimes a superposition of religious philosophies with acceptance of the conflicting cosmologies, sometimes striking a middle ground, and sometimes taking the practical attitude - popular with the young - of \"filtering the common best, and leaving the rest\", thus leading to the creation of many syncretic mix of faiths (such as [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]]). Since Independence, India has regained its more progressive schools of thought, like - [[democracy]], [[secularism]], rule of law, esteem for [[human rights]], rational deductive reasoning, development of [[Science]] and [[Technology]], etc. - are making slow but steady inroads into the collective modern Indian psyche. India's diversity forces it to evolve strong foundations of [[toleration|tolerance]] and pluralism, or face break-up. The Indian public is now also accepting modern [[Western society|western]] influences in their society and media - and what is emerging is a confluence of its past local culture with the new western culture (\"Social Globalisation\"). For some [[futuristic]] social thinkers, the miscegenation of diverse ancient culture with modernity, spirituality with science/technology, Eastern with Western world-view is potentially making India a social laboratory for the evolution of futuristic global-unity consciousness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auroville.org/economy/New_business_seminar05.htm|title=New Business and Global Consciousness|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/h_es/h_es_malho_global.htm|title=India's Place in Global Consciousness|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=home|title=Start|website=HereNow4u: Portal on Jainism and next level consciousness|accessdate=22 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Points against the rise of India as a superpower==\n\n=== Political obstacles ===\n{|align=right\n|[[Image:Kargil.map.gif|thumb|right|200px|India has had border disputes with both China and Pakistan.

One answer to irregular moisture is storage and irrigation, but this is countered in these regions by incredibly high rates of evaporation. In the [[Agra]] region of India, for example, rainfall exceeds the needs of local agriculture for only two months in the year, and the excess held in the soil in those wet months dries up in only three weeks.<ref>[http://www2.wwnorton.com/catalog/spring99/wealthpoverty.htm The Wealth and Poverty of Nations] by David Landes, Chapter 1.</ref>  Tropical zones are also more prone to endemic water-borne and parasitic diseases such as [[cholera]] and [[malaria]].<ref>[http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidinthenews/articles/Sciam_0301_article.html The Geography of Poverty and Wealth] Harvard</ref> As a result of climate change, the [[Gangotri Glacier]], among others, is receding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/10/09/stories/2005100900130200.htm|title=The Hindu : Magazine / Environment : The Ganga could run dry ...|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NasaNews/2002/200205299370.html DECLINE OF WORLD'S GLACIERS]</ref> Also, of the 3 million premature deaths in the world that occur each year due to outdoor and indoor air pollution, the highest number are assessed to occur in India.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/indiaenv.html  ''India's Environmental Issues''] EIA</ref>\n\n===Social issues===\n{{See also|Reservations in India}}\n\n====[[Communalism|Communal violence]]====\nIndia has a diverse mix of various [[religion]]s and [[ethnicity|races]].

The subcontinent's long and diverse history has given it a unique eclectic culture. It is often associated with spirituality. Thanks to its history of both indigenous and foreign influences - like the ancient Indian religions ([[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]) and the ancient Middle East Asian schools of thought (Abrahamic - [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] etc.) - the current Indian civilizational psyche is evolving into a complex mix of them - sometimes a superposition of religious philosophies with acceptance of the conflicting cosmologies, sometimes striking a middle ground, and sometimes taking the practical attitude - popular with the young - of \"filtering the common best, and leaving the rest\", thus leading to the creation of many syncretic mix of faiths (such as [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]]). Since Independence, India has regained its more progressive schools of thought, like - [[democracy]], [[secularism]], rule of law, esteem for [[human rights]], rational deductive reasoning, development of [[Science]] and [[Technology]], etc. - are making slow but steady inroads into the collective modern Indian psyche. India's diversity forces it to evolve strong foundations of [[toleration|tolerance]] and pluralism, or face break-up. The Indian public is now also accepting modern [[Western society|western]] influences in their society and media - and what is emerging is a confluence of its past local culture with the new western culture (\"Social Globalisation\"). For some [[futuristic]] social thinkers, the miscegenation of diverse ancient culture with modernity, spirituality with science/technology, Eastern with Western world-view is potentially making India a social laboratory for the evolution of futuristic global-unity consciousness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auroville.org/economy/New_business_seminar05.htm|title=New Business and Global Consciousness|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/h_es/h_es_malho_global.htm|title=India's Place in Global Consciousness|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=home|title=Start|website=HereNow4u: Portal on Jainism and next level consciousness|accessdate=22 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Points against the rise of India as a superpower==\n\n=== Political obstacles ===\n{|align=right\n|[[Image:Kargil.map.gif|thumb|right|200px|India has had border disputes with both China and Pakistan.

It is debatable whether this alone will be sufficient to ease inflationary pressures. The economy is running near or above capacity, and the RBI has noted that production must rise at a pace sufficient to match overall GDP growth if further inflationary pressures are to be avoided.  The Indian government has said that much of the rise in inflation recently can be attributed to short-term supply constraints, such as a shortage of key foodstuffs thanks to an erratic summer monsoon.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8374809 India's blossoming economy] Economist Intelligence Unit Briefing</ref>\n\n[[Image:KolkiwadiDam.jpg|thumb|250px|Dams like the [[Kolkewadi Dam]] have mitigated [[Electricity in India|India's power]] needs.]]\n\n====Energy dependence and costs====\nIndia heavily depends on foreign oil - a phenomenon likely to continue until non-fossil/renewable energy technology becomes economically viable in the country.<ref>[http://www.asia-studies.com/asia/Lowy/analysis/Hordern,%20Indias%20energy%20needs%20final%20rev%20v2.pdf India's energy needs] Lowy Institute</ref> To avert an energy crisis, India is desperately seeking alternate means of energy.

To improve the situation, a number of projects such as the building of hospital chains (like the [[Apollo Hospitals]], amongst others) has laid the foundation for a health system that matches global standards.

The climate thesis of economic development was first argued by [[Adam Smith]] and recently by [[David Landes]] in his ''The Wealth and Poverty of Nations''. Tropical areas generally average enough rainfall, but the timing is often irregular and unpredictable. The rain drops are large and the rate of fall often torrential. One answer to irregular moisture is storage and irrigation, but this is countered in these regions by incredibly high rates of evaporation. In the [[Agra]] region of India, for example, rainfall exceeds the needs of local agriculture for only two months in the year, and the excess held in the soil in those wet months dries up in only three weeks.<ref>[http://www2.wwnorton.com/catalog/spring99/wealthpoverty.htm The Wealth and Poverty of Nations] by David Landes, Chapter 1.</ref>  Tropical zones are also more prone to endemic water-borne and parasitic diseases such as [[cholera]] and [[malaria]].<ref>[http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidinthenews/articles/Sciam_0301_article.html The Geography of Poverty and Wealth] Harvard</ref> As a result of climate change, the [[Gangotri Glacier]], among others, is receding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/10/09/stories/2005100900130200.htm|title=The Hindu : Magazine / Environment : The Ganga could run dry ...|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NasaNews/2002/200205299370.html DECLINE OF WORLD'S GLACIERS]</ref> Also, of the 3 million premature deaths in the world that occur each year due to outdoor and indoor air pollution, the highest number are assessed to occur in India.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/indiaenv.html  ''India's Environmental Issues''] EIA</ref>\n\n===Social issues===\n{{See also|Reservations in India}}\n\n====[[Communalism|Communal violence]]====\nIndia has a diverse mix of various [[religion]]s and [[ethnicity|races]].

It is found in [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Sudan]], and [[Togo]]. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, dry savanna, and moist savanna. It is threatened by [[habitat loss]].\n\nPopulations of epauletted fruit bats are threatened by pesticides on fruit, human disturbance and over-collecting in the past. However, the number one reason it may be threatened is [[habitat destruction]].\n\nMostly found in Africa, these creatures have grayish-brown color fur with a white patch at the base of their ear in both males and females. These fruit bats are also very noisy creatures. In the context of mating behavior (see \"Reproduction\" below), adult males may hang from perches and perform a calling-display during which they utter a moderately loud bell like 'ping' at intervals of 1\u20133 seconds.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B_07noCPc4kC |last=Kingdon |first=Jonathan |title=Mammals of Africa, Volume IV: \"Hedgehogs, Shrews and Bats\" |publisher=A&C Black |year=2013 |isbn=9781408189962}}</ref>\n\nIt is very easy to tell the male fruit bat from the female fruit bat. In comparison, males are usually larger than females. The males also have gland-like pouches in the skin of their shoulder, that is surrounded by light colored patches and/or tufts of fur. Thus, one of the reasons why they are named Gambian epauletted fruit bats, it produces the effect of [[epaulettes]]; a decorative or ornamental piece. The only way one would be able to see the epaulettes is when the male becomes stressed or [[sexually stimulated]].

The whole colony is organized, with separate peripheral groups of immatures and non-breeding adults. The epauletted fruit bats travel in small groups of six to twenty bats. When the [[fruit bats]] are in flight, they remain together in long processions. The leaders often change, yet they retain the same direction of flight. (Mickleburgh)\n\nThey frequently sniff at each other's scent glands to establish personal recognition. Which represents high levels of social organization. When one is shot down, they show great concern and gather round swooping low to inspect it; a sign of affinity rather than totally independent behaviour. They roost during the day in mango trees and bamboo reeds or other trees. The Gambian epauletted fruit bats hang upside down alone or in groups up to twenty. The species' droppings support whole ecosystems of unique organisms, including bacteria useful in detoxifying wastes, and producing gasohol. This species feeds on [[nectar]] and [[fruits]] of many West African trees, presumably acting as [[pollinator]] and/or [[seed]] disperser. Some flowering trees depend on the bats for [[pollination]]. (Fenton)\n\nThe pack moves during sunset in large flocks from resting areas to feeding areas. To avoid predators, the bats will carry fruit away from the tree before eating. Over several nights bats may carry more than a ton of seeds from a single wild fig tree, dramatically increasing the number of seedlings that will survive in new locations. The fruit bats spend over half their lives roosting in various places. (Wilson)\n\nOn the outskirts of the camp, non-territorial males act as guards. They are alert to the slightest disturbance. They perform a visual inspection and either give a loud alarm signal, or remain still, keeping an eye open.<ref name=Nowak>{{cite book|url= https://archive.org/details/walkersbatsofwor00rona |url-access= registration |last=Nowak |first=Ronald M |title=Walker's BATS of the World |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1994 |isbn=9780801849862}}</ref>\n\nThe Gambian epauletted fruit bats are unlike other bats because they use sight rather than [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to find food. They also rely heavily on their smell because they use it to locate food and establish bonds with one another.<ref name=Nowak/>\n\n== Diet ==\nThese bats primarily eat small fruits, often found flying from tree to tree, feeding on their primary food source, the fig. However, the fig is not a nutritious food source, due to its low amounts of protein and high amounts of sugar, but it is abundant, so the bats must cover a large number of trees to receive the nutrition necessary to sustain flight and feed their young. However, these bats are not limited to eating just figs. They have also been known to feed on bananas, mangoes, guavas, and the nectar from ''Parkia biglobosa'' flowers. Despite this, figs are the primary food source because they are in bloom longer than the rest. The epauletted fruit bat has been known to spend eight to ten hours flying around from tree to tree eating because they burn more energy flying than they receive from the figs.<ref name=Morris>{{cite book |last1=Yalden |first1=Derek W |last2=Morris |first2=Patrick A |title=The Lives of Bats |publisher=Quadrangle/The New York Times Books Company |year=1975 |isbn=9780812906004 |url=https://archive.org/details/livesofbats00yald }}</ref>\n\nIt is very important that these bats spend so much time getting food because if they don't, then they will not have enough nutrients to give to their young and their babies will not survive. The young do stay in the nest while the parents retrieve the food, but instead, hang on to its mother's teats in flight. This is only until about five weeks, when the bat begins to learn to fly and sheds its milk teeth. (Fenton)\n\n== Reproduction ==\nThe Gambian epauletted fruit bats show [[sexual dimorphism]]. The males of these species are usually larger than the females and in addition possess glandular pouches in the skin of the shoulder which are surrounded by light colored tufts of hair. These produce the effect of [[epaulets]], and are how the species received its name. (Wilson)\n\nThe species have more than one mate at a time. The males emit mating calls during the breeding season; which is around April to May and October to November.<ref name=Wimsatt/>\n\nMales fly at night to different locations to mate. There, they begin courting calls which attract the females. While making their mating calls, males will flash snowy white patches of fur on their shoulders, called epaulets, which are usually concealed. Because they do this at night, the large white furs are more visible under the lighting conditions. (Wilson)\n\nThe [[gestation]] period usually lasts about six months, and pregnant females will roost apart from the males. There is usually one young per birth.<ref name=Morris/>\n\nAlthough fertilization ensues immediately after mating, there is little development of the embryo. The delay in embryonic development ensures that birth coincides with a season when food is abundant enough to maintain lactating females, which have a high demand for energy. The delay in embryonic development also permits mating to take place when both males and females are in prime physical condition and have access to good supplies of food.<ref name=Wimsatt/>\n\nNewborns grow rapidly, with various parts of their bodies growing at different rates. At birth, the thumbs and hind feet are almost adult size, and grow very little. However, the forearm and other bones supporting the wing enlarge quickly, producing a wing area in adults that is 10 times the size at birth. They rapidly gain weight until they are weaned. But once they begin to eat fruit instead of their mother's milk, their body weight decrease and they use up the fat reserve they have built up during nursing.<ref name=Wimsatt/>\n\nAt birth the species are equipped with distinctive milk teeth that appear to be useless as tools for eating solid food, but help them attach to their mother's teats. The shedding of milk teeth and the emergence of permanent teeth occurs at about the same time as the bats learn to fly and begin to eat fruit. (Fenton)\n\nThe lifespan of this bat is long for being such a small mammal. Most epauletted fruit bats can live up to 28 years, and average about 21 years. The mechanism for such a long life in bats is not known with certainty. Some suggest the longevity in bats is related to the [[calpain]] content of [[neurons]]. (Fenton)\n\n== Habitat ==\nFruit bats are tropical animals, but some species live in areas with only a limited fruiting season, as in east Africa where the Gambian epauletted fruit bat might feed on figs during the rainy season but in the semi-arid conditions of the rest of the year may have to fly several hundred miles to find a different climate where other trees are still in fruit.\n\nThe epauletted fruit bat's geographic range is from southern [[Zaire]] and [[Tanzania]] to eastern [[South Africa]], and southern [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]] to [[Senegal]] and southern [[Mali]] (Wilson). They are typically a lowland species occurring below 500 meters above sea level, however the Ethiopian populations have been found to occur up to 2,000 meters above sea level. It is native to the countries of [[Angola]], [[Benin]], [[Botswana]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[The Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], Ethiopia, [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Liberia]], Mali, [[Namibia]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], Senegal, [[Sierra Leone]], [[Sudan]], [[Togo]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]].<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nAs a fairly adaptable species to many types of environments, they can be found in a variety of habitats ranging from the dry savanna, moist savanna, mosaic, bushland, tropical dry forests, and subtropical dry forests habitats. They have also been reported to inhabit areas of partially degraded forest, mangrove, and swamp forest habitats. This species of bats prefer to live on the edge of forests and they tend to roost in places ranging from thick foliage, accumulated roots along stream banks, below the thatch of open sheds, and large tree hollows. (Fenton)\n\nThe species also tend to roost in small groups or as individuals. They can also roost low in trees during the day, undisturbed by the presence of people and even within areas that receive considerable light. These bats have been known to have a presence in agricultural areas with orchards of bananas, figs, mangoes, guavas, and other fruits. They have made the move to human areas due to encroachment by humans into their natural habitats.<ref name=Reeder>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JgAMbNSt8ikC |last1=Wilson |first1=Don E |last2=Reeder |first2=DeeAnn M |year=2005 |title=Mammal Species of the World: a taxonomic and geographic reference |edition=3 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=9780801882210}}</ref>\n\n== Health risks ==\nA misconception about bats is that they are all rabid. Bats can contract [[rabies]], but they also suffer the symptoms of the [[disease]] and eventually die from it. Bats are not unaffected carriers of rabies. So if all bats had rabies, there would be no bats in the world. When bat specimens are sent into state laboratories for testing, the number of bats with rabies is around 5-10%. This figure is highly inflated because only those bats that are suspected of having rabies are brought in to be tested. Past research indicates that the actual incidence of rabies in bat populations is less than 0.5% in most areas.<ref name=BatsAndRabies>{{cite web|url= https://batconservation.org/learn/bats-and-rabies/ |title= Bats and Rabies |publisher= Organization for Bat Conservation |accessdate=2017-09-14}}</ref>\n\nIt is also often believed that if a rabid animal contracts the rabies virus, that it will attack you; that is not always the case. The disease can manifest in two ways. The animal can become paralyzed, or it can become aggressive. Bats will usually exhibit the paralytic form of rabies, which immobilizes the animal. Although they are not usually aggressive, bats will bite if they are threatened.<ref name=BatConservation>{{cite web|url= http://www.batcon.org/resources/for-specific-issues/bats-human-health |publisher= Bat Conservation International |title=Bats & Human Health |accessdate=2017-09-14}}</ref>\n\nRabies is a deadly viral disease of the [[central nervous system]]. In almost all cases, the virus is passed on through the bite, contact with infected saliva, nervous tissues, open wounds or the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth of an infected animal. Like all other animals, if bats get infected with this disease, they will die.<ref name=BatConservation/>\n\nIf humans come in contact with rabies, it is far worse. After the infection has happened, symptoms can developed about 10 days to seven months.\n\nSome warning signs that occur include pain, burning and numbness at the place of infection. Also people with the disease experience sleeplessness, headaches, irritability, difficulty swallowing and throat spasms. They may experience fear of water (hydrophobia).<ref <ref name=\"cdc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/symptoms/index.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhen the systems appear, death follows 2\u201312 days after. If any bat bites a person they should get tested right away for rabies and treatment should be immediately.\nMost marks or bites from bats cannot be detected. Most punctures are a millimeter or less in diameter. Post-exposures treatment should be handled and get a shot. If a human is exposed to rabies, one should get initial IM injection of Human Rabies immune Globulin, otherwise known as HRIG.<ref name=BatsAndRabies/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book|last=Clarke |first=Joe T.R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWI3E4EtrWgC |title= A Clinical Guide to Inherited Metabolic Diseases |edition=3 |location= New York |publisher= Cambridge University |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-511-13324-4}}\n*{{cite book|last=Fenton |first=M Brock |title=Just Bats |url=https://archive.org/details/justbats0000fent |url-access=registration |publisher= University of Toronto Press |year=1983 |isbn=1442655380}}\n*{{cite book|last=Findley |first=James |title=Bats: a Community Perspective |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=1993 |issn=0957-0764}}\n*{{cite book|last=Graham |first=Gary L |title=Bats of the World |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1994 |isbn=0307240800}}\n*{{cite book |last=Hutson |first=Tony |title=Bats |publisher=Voyageur Press |year=2003 |isbn=9780896585003 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bats0000huts }}\n*{{cite book |last=Schober |first=Wilfried |title=The Lives of Bats |publisher=Arco Publishing |year=1984 |isbn=9780668059930 |url=https://archive.org/details/livesofbats00scho }}\n*{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fKFfBgAAQBAJ |last=Wilson |first=Don E |title=Bats in Question: The Smithsonian Answer Book |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution |year=2015 |isbn=9781588345110}}\n\n{{Pteropodidae|E.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q304118}}\n\n[[Category:Epomophorus]]\n[[Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1835]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=June 2013}}\n{{More citations needed|article|date=January 2011}}\n}}\n{{speciesbox\n| image = Gambian epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus gambianus).jpg\n| status = LC \n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n|status_ref = <ref name=IUCN>{{cite iucn|last1=Tanshi |first1=I |last2=Fahr |first2=J |doi=10.2305/IUCN.UK.2016-2.RLTS.T7903A22122670.en |page=e.T7903A22122670 |title=Epomophorus gambianus |volume=2016 |year=2016 }}</ref>\n| genus = Epomophorus\n| species = gambianus\n| authority = ([[William Ogilby|Ogilby]], 1835)\n| synonyms = {{specieslist\n| Pteropus gambianus|Ogilby, 1835}}\n| range_map = Gambian Epauletted Fruit Bat area.png\n| range_map_caption = Gambian epauletted fruit bat range\n}}\n\nThe '''Gambian epauletted fruit bat''' (''Epomophorus gambianus'') is a species of [[megabat]] in the family [[Pteropodidae]].\n\nThe species is known to travel in packs and are also known to be tropical. It is found in [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Sudan]], and [[Togo]]. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, dry savanna, and moist savanna. It is threatened by [[habitat loss]].\n\nPopulations of epauletted fruit bats are threatened by pesticides on fruit, human disturbance and over-collecting in the past. However the number one reason it may be threatened is [[habitat destruction]].\n\nMostly found in Africa, these creatures have grayish-brown color fur with a white patch at the base of their ear in both males and females. These fruit bats are also very noisy creatures. In the context of mating behavior (see \"Reproduction\" below), adult males may hang from perches and perform a calling-display during which they utter a moderately loud bell like 'ping' at intervals of 1\u20133 seconds.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B_07noCPc4kC |last=Kingdon |first=Jonathan |title=Mammals of Africa, Volume IV: \"Hedgehogs, Shrews and Bats\" |publisher=A&C Black |year=2013 |isbn=9781408189962}}</ref>\n\nIt is very easy to tell the male fruit bat from the female fruit bat. In comparison, the males are usually larger than the females. The males also have gland-like pouches in the skin of their shoulder, that is surrounded by light colored patches and/or tufts of fur. Thus, one of the reasons why they are named Gambian epauletted fruit bats, it produces the effect of [[epaulettes]]; a decorative or ornamental piece. The only way one would be able to see the epaulettes is when the male becomes stressed or [[sexually stimulated]].

They may experience fear of water (hydrophobia).<ref <ref name=\"cdc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/symptoms/index.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhen the systems appear, death follows 2\u201312 days after. If any bat bites a person they should get tested right away for rabies and treatment should be immediately.\nMost marks or bites from bats cannot be detected. Most punctures are a millimeter or less in diameter. Post-exposures treatment should be handled and get a shot. If a human is exposed to rabies, one should get initial IM injection of Human Rabies immune Globulin, otherwise known as HRIG.<ref name=BatsAndRabies/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book|last=Clarke |first=Joe T.R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWI3E4EtrWgC |title= A Clinical Guide to Inherited Metabolic Diseases |edition=3 |location= New York |publisher= Cambridge University |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-511-13324-4}}\n*{{cite book|last=Fenton |first=M Brock |title=Just Bats |url=https://archive.org/details/justbats0000fent |url-access=registration |publisher= University of Toronto Press |year=1983 |isbn=1442655380}}\n*{{cite book|last=Findley |first=James |title=Bats: a Community Perspective |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=1993 |issn=0957-0764}}\n*{{cite book|last=Graham |first=Gary L |title=Bats of the World |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1994 |isbn=0307240800}}\n*{{cite book |last=Hutson |first=Tony |title=Bats |publisher=Voyageur Press |year=2003 |isbn=9780896585003 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bats0000huts }}\n*{{cite book |last=Schober |first=Wilfried |title=The Lives of Bats |publisher=Arco Publishing |year=1984 |isbn=9780668059930 |url=https://archive.org/details/livesofbats00scho }}\n*{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fKFfBgAAQBAJ |last=Wilson |first=Don E |title=Bats in Question: The Smithsonian Answer Book |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution |year=2015 |isbn=9781588345110}}\n\n{{Pteropodidae|E.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q304118}}\n\n[[Category:Epomophorus]]\n[[Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1835]]\n", "name_user": "LittleDragon21", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambian_epauletted_fruit_bat"}
