The company retains a focus on China in its news broadcasts, and frequently covers topics that are censored in Mainland China. Its mission is to \"promote uncensored information on China; to restore and promote traditional Chinese culture; and to facilitate mutual understanding between the East and West\".<ref>https://ntdtv.org/en/aboutus.html</ref>\n\n==History==\nNTD was founded in 2001 by [[Falun Gong]] practitioners, with its mission being to offer \"uncensored news\" about China that [[state-controlled media]] would not cover.

At present, the station's satellite coverage reaches Asia, Europe, and Australia in several languages.\n\nNTD, along with ''[[The Epoch Times]]'' and [[Sound of Hope]], was founded by [[Falun Gong]] practitioners who had emigrated to the West. Many of its staff are Falun Gong adherents who volunteer their time and services.

Following this, Eutelsat issued a press release and written declaration, denying all charges of censorship against NTD. The company insists that NTD's shutdown resulted solely from the technical failure experienced by W5 satellite, and adds that NTD is being broadcast across Europe via Eutelsat's HOT BIRD video neighbourhood (which unlike W5, cannot be received from China).<ref name=\"eutelsatJan15\">[http://www.eutelsat.com/news/compress/en/2009/html/PR0309/PR0309.html Eutelsat reaffirms to European institutions the irreversible and purely technical nature of the incident resulting in the interruption of consumer broadcasting services through its W5 satellite], January 15, 2009, retrieved on 2009-01-19</ref>\n\nIn June 2010 the [[Canadian Prime Minister's Office]] cancelled a press conference that NTD and Epoch Times would have attended, so that Chinese President [[Hu Jintao]] would not come into contact with the broadcaster, allegedly following terms from the Chinese consulate. According to the ''Toronto Star'', such press conferences are usually standard procedure for foreign leaders visiting the Parliament, and the cancellation was seen as an extraordinary measure to keep NTD away from the Chinese President.<ref name=\"star\">Susan Delacourt, [https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/torontog20summit/article/827903--harper-helps-hu-keep-critics-away \"Harper helps Hu keep critics away\"], Fri Jun 25, 2010</ref>\n\n==NTD Canada==\n{{Infobox TV channel|\n| name             = New Tang Dynasty Television\n| logofile         = NTD Television.png\n| logocaption      = '''NTD Television logo'''\n| logosize         = 150px\n| launch           = March 28, 2012\n| picture format   = [[1080i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n| owner            = New Tang Dynasty Television Canada\n| country          = [[Canada]]\n| broadcast area   = National\n| headquarters     = [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]\n| web              = {{url|ca.ntdtv.com}}\n| cable serv 1     = [[Novus Entertainment]]\n| cable chan 1     = Channel 340\n| cable serv 2     = [[Rogers Cable]]\n| cable chan 2     = Channel 817\n| cable serv 3     = [[Shaw Communications|Shaw Cable]]\n| cable chan 3     = Channel 541\n| iptv serv 1      = [[Rogers Ignite]]\n| iptv chan 1      = Channel 767\n| iptv serv 2      = [[Bell Fibe TV]]\n| iptv chan 2      = Channel 727\n}}\nNTD Television Canada officially launched on [[Rogers Cable]] on September 30, 2008,<ref>{{cite web|title=NTD Television Canada's official launch on Rogers in September, 2008|url=http://www.ntdtv.com/xtr/b5/2008/10/16/a209800.html |date=October 16, 2008 }}</ref> on [[Bell Fibe TV]] in 2010, and on [[Shaw Communications|Shaw Cable]] on March 28, 2012.
