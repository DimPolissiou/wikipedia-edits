It aims to focus on and influence the multiple determinants of health (economic, social, behavioural and biological) and to undertake and evaluate multi-sectoral interventions to positively influence those determinants.  It also involves the study of [[health system]]s, their structure and management practices as channels for delivery of health services for all sections of the population.\n\nAs India experiences a rapid health transition, it is confronted both by an unfinished agenda of eliminating infectious diseases, nutritional deficiencies, unsafe pregnancies and the challenge of escalating epidemics of [[non-communicable disease]]s.

Public health education must include subject areas like epidemiology, biostatistics, behavioural sciences, health economics, health services management, environmental health, health inequities and human rights, gender and health, health promotion and communication, ethics of health care and research.  These diverse disciplines need to establish synergistic links in designing and delivering [[health care]] in prioritized sectors.  It is also essential to advance a trans-disciplinary research agenda which informs policy and empowers programs.  There is a constant need for surveillance, monitoring and evaluation.  The interventions proposed need to be evidence based, context specific and resource sensitive.

It recognizes the fact that meeting the [[Health Human Resources|shortfall of health professionals]] is imperative for a sustained and holistic response to the public health concerns in the country, which in turn requires health care to be addressed not only from the scientific perspective of what works, but also from the social perspective of who needs it the most.

The hosts nominal run on daily narratives created by the park operators to interact with the guests, resetting their programming and memories each night. Hosts cannot harm humans, which allows guests to live out carnal pleasures, including sexual and violent desires against hosts. \n\nOver the course of the first two seasons, it is shown that the park and the technology behind the hosts is based on Dr. Robert Ford and Dr. Arnold Weber, with the park's construction and operation funded by the Delos Corporation and opened around the early 2020s. In 2052, events led to the hosts gaining [[sentience]] (shown through season one) and revolting against the guests and Delos shareholders, technicians, and security forces in the park. In the few weeks that followed, shown through the second season, additional Delos security forces arrive to quell the hosts' rebellion, killing most of them and preventing any from escaping the park. \n\nThe third season takes place about six years later in 2058, as some hosts have managed to escape the parks to live among the humans to continue their revenge. A large company, Incite, has created a large [[artificial intelligence]] system called Rehoboam ostensibly designed to monitor protection of private data, but, as some hosts have discovered, has been used to control behavior of individuals on a mass scale.\n\n==Main characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 115\n\n| image1    = Evan Rachel Wood July 2017.jpg\n| caption1  = [[Evan Rachel Wood]] (Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image2    = Thandie Newton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption2  = [[Thandie Newton]] (Maeve Millay)\n\n| image3    = Jeffrey Wright by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption3  = [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] (Bernard Lowe & Arnold Weber)\n\n| image4    = James Marsden by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption4  = [[James Marsden]] (Teddy Flood)\n\n| image5    = Ingrid Bolso Berdal by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption5  = [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] (Armistice)\n\n| image6    = Luke Hemsworth by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption6  = [[Luke Hemsworth]] (Ashley Stubbs)\n\n| image7    = Sidse Babett Knudsen C\u00e9sar 2016.jpg\n| caption7  = [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] (Theresa Cullen)\n\n| image8    = Simon Quarterman by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption8  = [[Simon Quarterman]] (Lee Sizemore)\n\n| image9    = Rodrigo Santoro by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption9  = [[Rodrigo Santoro]] (Hector Escaton)\n\n| image10    = Angela Sarafyan by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption10  = [[Angela Sarafyan]] (Clementine Pennyfeather)\n\n| image11    = Shannon Woodward by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption11  = [[Shannon Woodward]] (Elsie Hughes)\n\n| image12   = Ed Harris by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption12 = [[Ed Harris]] (William \"Man in Black\")\n\n| image13  = Jimmi Simpson by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption13 = [[Jimmi Simpson]] (William)\n\n| image14   = AnthonyHopkins10TIFF.jpg\n| caption14 = [[Anthony Hopkins]] (Robert Ford)\n\n| image15   = Ben Barnes by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption15 = [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] (Logan Delos)\n\n| image16   = Clifton Collins Jr 2013 (cropped).jpg\n| caption16 = [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] (Lawrence Gonzalez & El Lazo)\n\n| image17   = Tessa Thompson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption17 = [[Tessa Thompson]] (Charlotte Hale & Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image18   = TalulahRileyAug09.jpg\n| caption18 = [[Talulah Riley]] (Angela)\n\n| image19   = Katja herbers-1453203980 (cropped).jpg\n| caption19 = [[Katja Herbers]] (Emily)\n\n| image20   = Zahn McClarnon 2016.png\n| caption20 = [[Zahn McClarnon]] (Akecheta)\n\n| image21   = Aaron Paul by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption21 = [[Aaron Paul]] (Caleb Nichols)\n\n| image22   = Vincent Cassel le moine.jpg\n| caption22 = [[Vincent Cassel]] (Engerraund Serac)\n}}\n===Dolores Abernathy===\n'''Dolores Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Evan Rachel Wood]] and is one of the series' central characters.

Maeve is a host who acts as the [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] of Sweetwater, the largest town in Westworld. Through Dolores, she becomes aware that her life has been a lie, and recalls memories of raising a daughter before she was killed by a guest. She is able to \"wake up\" within the Mesa, where she coerces technician Felix to alter her programming, making her more intelligent and able to control other hosts with her voice, and befriends Hector and Armistice to help protect her. At the end of the first season, Felix is able to help her leave the Westworld park. However, she is drawn back on the promise of finding her daughter, even though she is aware this daughter was from a previous narrative. The second season focuses on her attempts to locate her daughter.\n\n===Bernard Lowe===\n'''Bernard Lowe''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He is the head of the Westworld Programming Division and creator of artificial people. Later in the plot, he is revealed to be a host under Ford's control, made in the image of Westworld's co-creator, Arnold Weber, and based on Ford's and Dolores' memories of him. \"Bernard Lowe\" is an [[anagram]] of \"Arnold Weber\".\n\n===Arnold Weber===\n'''Arnold Weber''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]].

When the park was nearing opening, 30+ years before the \"present day\" of the show's timeline, Arnold had not yet been able to succeed in this, having concluded that the path to sentience was not simply linear. Having failed to achieve his goal, and believing that the intended function of even non-sentient hosts was still tantamount to them being misused by guests, he instructed Dolores to kill all the other hosts, then kill himself and herself, hoping this tragic event would prevent the park from opening.\n\n===Teddy Flood===\n'''Theodore \"Teddy\" Flood''' is portrayed by [[James Marsden]]. He is a host in the role of a gunslinger who returns to Sweetwater looking to rekindle his relationship with Dolores.\n\n===Armistice===\n'''Armistice''' is portrayed by [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]].

A rising star in the Programming Division tasked with remedying odd behavior in the park's hosts. She was briefly knocked out by Bernard (under the control of Ford) as she \"got in the way\" of Ford's plan. In the second season, she was shocked to learn Delos' secret guest-data collection project while also learning that Bernard is a host. Fearing that Bernard is still under the control of Ford even after Ford has died, she attempted to negotiate with Charlotte to keep Bernard within the park, in exchange for her silence on the project - instead, Charlotte kills her ruthlessly.\n\n===William===\n'''William''', also known as the '''Man in Black''' or '''Billy''', is portrayed by [[Ed Harris]] (and [[Jimmi Simpson]] as a young man). He was a reluctant first-time visitor to Westworld, joining his future brother-in-law, Logan Delos. Initially dismissive of the park's more lascivious attractions, he slowly uncovered a deeper meaning to the park's narrative. He later became a rich, sadistic Westworld guest searching for a \"deeper level\" in the park. Outside of the park, he is married to Juliet, the daughter of Delos corporation creator James Delos, and has a daughter Emily. He is also a board member of Delos, and has achieved prominence as the owner of a medical foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/23/westworld-dissonance-theory|title=Westworld postmortem: Producers discuss episode 4|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 23, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> His obsession with the Westworld park, and the dark acts he committed against hosts while in it, led to Juliet's suicide, which he blamed himself for. While he once had a vision of using host bodies to house the minds of humans&mdash;such as trying to help his deceased father-in-law gain immortality&mdash;he later expresses regret at having allowed the project which he characterises as his \"greatest mistake\". His motives are often unclear, at once seeking to destroy Westworld whilst simultaneously rejecting the possibility of personal redemption.\n\n===Robert Ford===\n'''Robert Ford''' is portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. He is also portrayed by co-star [[Paul Fox (actor)|Paul Fox]]<ref name=\"paulfox\"/> in season 1 and guest star Paul Riley Fox<ref name=\"paulRfox\"/> in season 2 as a young man.<!--These are two different actors: see sources--> He is the founder and creative director of Westworld, who has near-total control over the park's functions and the hosts. It is eventually revealed that he has been orchestrating the hosts' uprising with his new and final park narrative, \"Journey into Night\". Similar to his old partner Arnold, he wanted hosts such as Dolores and Maeve to achieve consciousness and break free of the park. At the end of the first season, he seemingly allows himself to be killed by Dolores out of her own free will. However, he is revealed to have uploaded his consciousness to the park's \"hive mind\" data center, from where he has been guiding William through various hosts (portrayed by [[Oliver Bell]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], and [[Izabella Alvarez]]) and continuing to orchestrate the uprising. After reuniting with Bernard, he transfers himself into his former partner's control unit and takes control of his body (portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright]]). Finding an incapacitated Maeve, he encourages his \"favourite\" host and unlocks her \"core\" permissions. At the end of the second season, Ford allows himself to be deleted by Bernard so that he can regain his free will, dying a final time. Upon Bernard attaining consciousness, a hallucination of Ford bids him a final farewell.\n\n===Logan Delos===\n'''Logan Delos''' is portrayed by [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]]. Logan, a member of the Delos Corporation, led the company's investment into Westworld some thirty years prior to the present events. Shortly after this, he brings his soon-to-be brother-in-law William to visit Westworld and tries to have him enjoy the park's more hedonistic offerings, but William comes to other conclusions about how to take advantage of Westworld for financial gain. James Delos, Logan's father, became dissatisfied with Logan's investment in Westworld until William suggested the lucrative opportunities they could pursue, such as selling a form of immortality by transferring human minds into host bodies. James subsequently named William, instead of Logan, as successor to the Delos company, and Logan entered a deep depression, eventually killing himself by overdose.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Westworld casting switch: Narnia star replacing Once Upon actor|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/20/westworld-ben-barnes|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Lawrence Gonzales===\n'''Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez''' is portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. He is a host with a reputation as a charming but lethal outlaw with a knack for maneuvering and negotiating the various criminal elements of Westworld.

In the second season, he becomes a traveling companion of the Man in Black during the early days of the host's rebellion.\n\n===El Lazo===\n'''El Lazo''' is a host role formerly filled by Lawrence, portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]].

She proved to be a ruthless director as she mercilessly kidnaps Peter for his control unit and kills Elsie to silence her. She was eventually killed by Dolores, who was implanted into an exact Charlotte-body replica by Bernard, in retaliation of Elsie's murder.\n\nA '''host replica of Charlotte Hale''' is introduced in season 2. Dolores uses the host to leave Westworld. She then rebuilds her original host body at Arnold's house and transfers her consciousness back into it. The host replica of Charlotte Hale is then instructed by Dolores to play the part of Charlotte Hale in the real world, in an attempt to control Delos Corporation.\n\n===Peter Abernathy===\n'''Peter Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Louis Herthum]]. He is a host and Dolores's father. One cycle, he finds a picture of [[Times Square]] that a guest has dropped, a scene he cannot comprehend, and coupled with the Reveries update, causes his program to falter. When the next day's cycle starts, as Dolores greets him, he whispers to her, \"These violent delights have violent ends\", which causes a similar disruption in Dolores' programming and leads her on the route to sentience. The park staff discover Peter is malfunctioning, forcing the park to decommission him and replace him with a new Peter Abernathy host (portrayed by guest actor [[Bradford Tatum]] in season 1), while the original is placed in cold storage. \n\nIn the second season, Charlotte Hale uses the Peter host to try to smuggle intellectual property out of the park via his \"pearl\". Once the hosts revolt, the Peter host goes missing, and he becomes the target of Charlotte and her Delos security forces, as well as Dolores who considers him her real father, but also aware his pearl contains data she needs to access the Forge. Charlotte recovers Peter but is unable to extract the data before Dolores finds him; after a tearful goodbye knowing that his host system is failing, Dolores cuts the control core, containing the encrypted data, out of his body.\n\n===Karl Strand===\n'''Karl Strand''' is portrayed by [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]]. Introduced in season 2, he is the leader of [[Quality assurance|QA]], Delos' security team, and tasked with taking control of Westworld from the hosts after Dolores' uprising.\n\n===Emily===\n'''Emily''', also known as '''Grace''', is portrayed by [[Katja Herbers]]. Introduced in season 2, she is also portrayed by guest actress Adison LaPenna as a child in season 2. She is William's daughter, and is formally introduced in the second season, seen as an adult guest at a Delos park themed on the [[British Raj]], one of the six (or more) parks on the Delos-controlled island. When the hosts in the Raj start to exhibit the same revolt as the Westworld ones, Emily escapes into Westworld and finds William, traveling as the Man in Black, during his mission.

Unlike Dolores and Maeve, he has not been manipulated into it by Ford, who nonetheless has followed Akecheta's progress with interest. His raiding parties have been rescue attempts aimed at securing hosts that he intends to lead out of Westworld. Zahn McClarnon is credited as a main character in \"Kiksuya\", despite being credited as a recurring guest star in previous episodes of season 2.\n\n===Caleb Nichols===\n'''Caleb Nichols''' is portrayed by [[Aaron Paul]]. Introduced in season 3, he is a former soldier who lost his friend Francis during combat. Now living in Los Angeles, he is trying to find a legitimate job to help pay for his own way as well as to support his mother living in a private nursing home. When he was eight, his mother had a bout of [[schizophrenia]], leaving her institutionalized ever since. He works at low-paying construction jobs and takes petty crime jobs that are offered by the \"Rico\" app. He tried to deal with his trauma by engaging with a virtual version of Francis as a friend that calls him frequently. Through a Rico job, he encounters and rescues Dolores, and she in turn rescues him when he becomes a target of a Rico manhunt. She shows him that the Incite system, with all the data it has collected on him and predicting that he will commit suicide in a decade, purposely keeps him to menial work, and urges him to help in her revolution, which he accepts.\n\n===Engerraund Serac===\n'''Engerraund Serac''' is portrayed by [[Vincent Cassel]]. Introduced in season 3, he was one of the co-founders of Incite, Inc. along with Liam Dempsey Sr. ([[Jefferson Mays]]), together creating an [[artificial intelligence]] system named Solomon to help monitor the private data of citizens. Serac eventually created a more advanced system based on Solomon called Rehoboam, which he considered as the author of humanity's future. When Dolores escaped Westworld and began to interfere with the system, Serac sought out Maeve's help to track Dolores down and kill her. It is also revealed that he is the one for whom Charlotte Hale was attempting to smuggle the guests' data out of Westworld using the Peter Abernathy host in seasons 1 and 2, making him the series'

The hosts nominal run on daily narratives created by the park operators to interact with the guests, resetting their programming and memories each night. Hosts cannot harm humans, which allows guests to live out carnal pleasures, including sexual and violent desires against hosts. \n\nOver the course of the first two seasons, it is shown that the park and the technology behind the hosts is based on Dr. Robert Ford and Dr. Arnold Weber, with the park's construction and operation funded by the Delos Corporation and opened around the early 2020s. In 2052, events led to the hosts gaining [[sentience]] (shown through season one) and revolting against the guests and Delos shareholders, technicians, and security forces in the park. In the few weeks that followed, shown through the second season, additional Delos security forces arrive to quell the hosts' rebellion, killing most of them and preventing any from escaping the park. \n\nThe third season takes place about six years later in 2058, as some hosts have managed to escape the parks to live among the humans to continue their revenge. A large company, Incite, has created a large [[artificial intelligence]] system called Rehoboam ostensibly designed to monitor protection of private data, but, as some hosts have discovered, has been used to control behavior of individuals on a mass scale.\n\n==Main characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 115\n\n| image1    = Evan Rachel Wood July 2017.jpg\n| caption1  = [[Evan Rachel Wood]] (Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image2    = Thandie Newton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption2  = [[Thandie Newton]] (Maeve Millay)\n\n| image3    = Jeffrey Wright by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption3  = [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] (Bernard Lowe & Arnold Weber)\n\n| image4    = James Marsden by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption4  = [[James Marsden]] (Teddy Flood)\n\n| image5    = Ingrid Bolso Berdal by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption5  = [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] (Armistice)\n\n| image6    = Luke Hemsworth by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption6  = [[Luke Hemsworth]] (Ashley Stubbs)\n\n| image7    = Sidse Babett Knudsen C\u00e9sar 2016.jpg\n| caption7  = [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] (Theresa Cullen)\n\n| image8    = Simon Quarterman by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption8  = [[Simon Quarterman]] (Lee Sizemore)\n\n| image9    = Rodrigo Santoro by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption9  = [[Rodrigo Santoro]] (Hector Escaton)\n\n| image10    = Angela Sarafyan by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption10  = [[Angela Sarafyan]] (Clementine Pennyfeather)\n\n| image11    = Shannon Woodward by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption11  = [[Shannon Woodward]] (Elsie Hughes)\n\n| image12   = Ed Harris by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption12 = [[Ed Harris]] (William \"Man in Black\")\n\n| image13  = Jimmi Simpson by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption13 = [[Jimmi Simpson]] (William)\n\n| image14   = AnthonyHopkins10TIFF.jpg\n| caption14 = [[Anthony Hopkins]] (Robert Ford)\n\n| image15   = Ben Barnes by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption15 = [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] (Logan Delos)\n\n| image16   = Clifton Collins Jr 2013 (cropped).jpg\n| caption16 = [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] (Lawrence Gonzalez & El Lazo)\n\n| image17   = Tessa Thompson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption17 = [[Tessa Thompson]] (Charlotte Hale & Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image18   = TalulahRileyAug09.jpg\n| caption18 = [[Talulah Riley]] (Angela)\n\n| image19   = Katja herbers-1453203980 (cropped).jpg\n| caption19 = [[Katja Herbers]] (Emily)\n\n| image20   = Zahn McClarnon 2016.png\n| caption20 = [[Zahn McClarnon]] (Akecheta)\n\n| image21   = Aaron Paul by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption21 = [[Aaron Paul]] (Caleb Nichols)\n\n| image22   = Vincent Cassel le moine.jpg\n| caption22 = [[Vincent Cassel]] (Engerraund Serac)\n}}\n===Dolores Abernathy===\n'''Dolores Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Evan Rachel Wood]] and is one of the series' central characters. She is the oldest host still working in the park. Dolores is a rancher's daughter who discovers her entire life is an elaborately constructed lie. Her aesthetic drew influences from [[Andrew Wyeth]]'s painting ''[[Christina's World]]'' as well as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray|title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 16, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> Later in the series, she is also portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]] in a [[#Charlotte Hale|host replica of Charlotte Hale]].\n\n===Maeve Millay===\n'''Maeve Millay''' is portrayed by [[Thandie Newton]]. Maeve is a host who acts as the [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] of Sweetwater, the largest town in Westworld. Through Dolores, she becomes aware that her life has been a lie, and recalls memories of raising a daughter before she was killed by a guest. She is able to \"wake up\" within the Mesa, where she coerces technician Felix to alter her programming, making her more intelligent and able to control other hosts with her voice, and befriends Hector and Armistice to help protect her. At the end of the first season, Felix is able to help her leave the Westworld park. However, she is drawn back on the promise of finding her daughter, even though she is aware this daughter was from a previous narrative. The second season focuses on her attempts to locate her daughter.\n\n===Bernard Lowe===\n'''Bernard Lowe''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He is the head of the Westworld Programming Division and creator of artificial people. Later in the plot, he is revealed to be a host under Ford's control, made in the image of Westworld's co-creator, Arnold Weber, and based on Ford's and Dolores' memories of him. \"Bernard Lowe\" is an [[anagram]] of \"Arnold Weber\".\n\n===Arnold Weber===\n'''Arnold Weber''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]].

When the park was nearing opening, 30+ years before the \"present day\" of the show's timeline, Arnold had not yet been able to succeed in this, having concluded that the path to sentience was not simply linear. Having failed to achieve his goal, and believing that the intended function of even non-sentient hosts was still tantamount to them being misused by guests, he instructed Dolores to kill all the other hosts, then kill himself and herself, hoping this tragic event would prevent the park from opening.\n\n===Teddy Flood===\n'''Theodore \"Teddy\" Flood''' is portrayed by [[James Marsden]]. He is a host in the role of a gunslinger who returns to Sweetwater looking to rekindle his relationship with Dolores.\n\n===Armistice===\n'''Armistice''' is portrayed by [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]].

A rising star in the Programming Division tasked with remedying odd behavior in the park's hosts. She was briefly knocked out by Bernard (under the control of Ford) as she \"got in the way\" of Ford's plan. In the second season, she was shocked to learn Delos' secret guest-data collection project while also learning that Bernard is a host. Fearing that Bernard is still under the control of Ford even after Ford has died, she attempted to negotiate with Charlotte to keep Bernard within the park, in exchange for her silence on the project - instead, Charlotte kills her ruthlessly.\n\n===William===\n'''William''', also known as the '''Man in Black''' or '''Billy''', is portrayed by [[Ed Harris]] (and [[Jimmi Simpson]] as a young man). He was a reluctant first-time visitor to Westworld, joining his future brother-in-law, Logan Delos. Initially dismissive of the park's more lascivious attractions, he slowly uncovered a deeper meaning to the park's narrative. He later became a rich, sadistic Westworld guest searching for a \"deeper level\" in the park. Outside of the park, he is married to Juliet, the daughter of Delos corporation creator James Delos, and has a daughter Emily. He is also a board member of Delos, and has achieved prominence as the owner of a medical foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/23/westworld-dissonance-theory|title=Westworld postmortem: Producers discuss episode 4|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 23, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> His obsession with the Westworld park, and the dark acts he committed against hosts while in it, led to Juliet's suicide, which he blamed himself for. While he once had a vision of using host bodies to house the minds of humans&mdash;such as trying to help his deceased father-in-law gain immortality&mdash;he later expresses regret at having allowed the project which he characterises as his \"greatest mistake\". His motives are often unclear, at once seeking to destroy Westworld whilst simultaneously rejecting the possibility of personal redemption.\n\n===Robert Ford===\n'''Robert Ford''' is portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. He is also portrayed by co-star [[Paul Fox (actor)|Paul Fox]]<ref name=\"paulfox\"/> in season 1 and guest star Paul Riley Fox<ref name=\"paulRfox\"/> in season 2 as a young man.<!--These are two different actors: see sources--> He is the founder and creative director of Westworld, who has near-total control over the park's functions and the hosts. It is eventually revealed that he has been orchestrating the hosts' uprising with his new and final park narrative, \"Journey into Night\". Similar to his old partner Arnold, he wanted hosts such as Dolores and Maeve to achieve consciousness and break free of the park. At the end of the first season, he seemingly allows himself to be killed by Dolores out of her own free will. However, he is revealed to have uploaded his consciousness to the park's \"hive mind\" data center, from where he has been guiding William through various hosts (portrayed by [[Oliver Bell]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], and [[Izabella Alvarez]]) and continuing to orchestrate the uprising. After reuniting with Bernard, he transfers himself into his former partner's control unit and takes control of his body (portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright]]). Finding an incapacitated Maeve, he encourages his \"favourite\" host and unlocks her \"core\" permissions. At the end of the second season, Ford allows himself to be deleted by Bernard so that he can regain his free will, dying a final time. Upon Bernard attaining consciousness, a hallucination of Ford bids him a final farewell.\n\n===Logan Delos===\n'''Logan Delos''' is portrayed by [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]]. Logan, a member of the Delos Corporation, led the company's investment into Westworld some thirty years prior to the present events. Shortly after this, he brings his soon-to-be brother-in-law William to visit Westworld and tries to have him enjoy the park's more hedonistic offerings, but William comes to other conclusions about how to take advantage of Westworld for financial gain. James Delos, Logan's father, became dissatisfied with Logan's investment in Westworld until William suggested the lucrative opportunities they could pursue, such as selling a form of immortality by transferring human minds into host bodies. James subsequently named William, instead of Logan, as successor to the Delos company, and Logan entered a deep depression, eventually killing himself by overdose.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Westworld casting switch: Narnia star replacing Once Upon actor|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/20/westworld-ben-barnes|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Lawrence Gonzales===\n'''Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez''' is portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. He is a host with a reputation as a charming but lethal outlaw with a knack for maneuvering and negotiating the various criminal elements of Westworld. In the past, the host has played the El Lazo role. Lawrence (and possibly his version of El Lazo) has a deep love for his wife and daughter, which has an impact on his interactions with the young William and his older Man in Black. In the second season, he becomes a traveling companion of the Man in Black during the early days of the host's rebellion.\n\n===El Lazo===\n'''El Lazo''' is a host role formerly filled by Lawrence, portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. In the season 1 flashbacks, the host El Lazo encountered Logan, William and Dolores in Pariah. Sometime later, the role of El Lazo was assigned to another host. In the second season, the new El Lazo is portrayed by guest actor [[Giancarlo Esposito]].\n\n===Charlotte Hale===\n'''Charlotte Hale''' is portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]]. Delos' executive director of the board overseeing Westworld. Outside of Westworld, she had been married to Jake but since divorced, and had a son Nathan.\n\nShe seeks to smuggle Ford's hosts' data out of Westworld on behalf of Delos via Peter Abernathy's control unit and allow the company to wrestle control of the park away from him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/11/westworld-is-better-when-it-starts-having-fun.html?mid=full-rss-vulture|title=Westworld Is Better When It Starts Having Fun|work=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Jackson|last=McHenry|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> It is shown in the third season that this was planned with Engerraund Serac, who wanted the Delos data for his own purposes.\n\nCharlotte's plan turned awry when Ford had successfully lead to the hosts' uprising, led by the awakened Dolores. She proved to be a ruthless director as she mercilessly kidnaps Peter for his control unit and kills Elsie to silence her. She was eventually killed by Dolores, who was implanted into an exact Charlotte-body replica by Bernard, in retaliation of Elsie's murder.\n\nA '''host replica of Charlotte Hale''' is introduced in season 2. Dolores uses the host to leave Westworld. She then rebuilds her original host body at Arnold's house and transfers her consciousness back into it. The host replica of Charlotte Hale is then instructed by Dolores to play the part of Charlotte Hale in the real world, in an attempt to control Delos Corporation.\n\n===Peter Abernathy===\n'''Peter Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Louis Herthum]]. He is a host and Dolores's father. One cycle, he finds a picture of [[Times Square]] that a guest has dropped, a scene he cannot comprehend, and coupled with the Reveries update, causes his program to falter. When the next day's cycle starts, as Dolores greets him, he whispers to her, \"These violent delights have violent ends\", which causes a similar disruption in Dolores' programming and leads her on the route to sentience. The park staff discover Peter is malfunctioning, forcing the park to decommission him and replace him with a new Peter Abernathy host (portrayed by guest actor [[Bradford Tatum]] in season 1), while the original is placed in cold storage. \n\nIn the second season, Charlotte Hale uses the Peter host to try to smuggle intellectual property out of the park via his \"pearl\". Once the hosts revolt, the Peter host goes missing, and he becomes the target of Charlotte and her Delos security forces, as well as Dolores who considers him her real father, but also aware his pearl contains data she needs to access the Forge. Charlotte recovers Peter but is unable to extract the data before Dolores finds him; after a tearful goodbye knowing that his host system is failing, Dolores cuts the control core, containing the encrypted data, out of his body.\n\n===Karl Strand===\n'''Karl Strand''' is portrayed by [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]]. Introduced in season 2, he is the leader of [[Quality assurance|QA]], Delos' security team, and tasked with taking control of Westworld from the hosts after Dolores' uprising.\n\n===Emily===\n'''Emily''', also known as '''Grace''', is portrayed by [[Katja Herbers]]. Introduced in season 2, she is also portrayed by guest actress Adison LaPenna as a child in season 2. She is William's daughter, and is formally introduced in the second season, seen as an adult guest at a Delos park themed on the [[British Raj]], one of the six (or more) parks on the Delos-controlled island. When the hosts in the Raj start to exhibit the same revolt as the Westworld ones, Emily escapes into Westworld and finds William, traveling as the Man in Black, during his mission.

It is subsequently revealed that he started to achieve sentience decades earlier, purposefully avoiding death for many years and accumulating knowledge of the \"other world\". Unlike Dolores and Maeve, he has not been manipulated into it by Ford, who nonetheless has followed Akecheta's progress with interest. His raiding parties have been rescue attempts aimed at securing hosts that he intends to lead out of Westworld. Zahn McClarnon is credited as a main character in \"Kiksuya\", despite being credited as a recurring guest star in previous episodes of season 2.\n\n===Caleb Nichols===\n'''Caleb Nichols''' is portrayed by [[Aaron Paul]]. Introduced in season 3, he is a former soldier who lost his friend Francis during combat. Now living in Los Angeles, he is trying to find a legitimate job to help pay for his own way as well as to support his mother living in a private nursing home. When he was eight, his mother had a bout of [[schizophrenia]], leaving her institutionalized ever since. He works at low-paying construction jobs and takes petty crime jobs that are offered by the \"Rico\" app. He tried to deal with his trauma by engaging with a virtual version of Francis as a friend that calls him frequently. Through a Rico job, he encounters and rescues Dolores, and she in turn rescues him when he becomes a target of a Rico manhunt. She shows him that the Incite system, with all the data it has collected on him and predicting that he will commit suicide in a decade, purposely keeps him to menial work, and urges him to help in her revolution, which he accepts.\n\n===Engerraund Serac===\n'''Engerraund Serac''' is portrayed by [[Vincent Cassel]]. Introduced in season 3, he was one of the co-founders of Incite, Inc. along with Liam Dempsey Sr. ([[Jefferson Mays]]), together creating an [[artificial intelligence]] system named Solomon to help monitor the private data of citizens. Serac eventually created a more advanced system based on Solomon called Rehoboam, which he considered as the author of humanity's future. When Dolores escaped Westworld and began to interfere with the system, Serac sought out Maeve's help to track Dolores down and kill her. It is also revealed that he is the one for whom Charlotte Hale was attempting to smuggle the guests' data out of Westworld using the Peter Abernathy host in seasons 1 and 2, making him the series' overarching antagonist.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n* [[Steven Ogg]] as Rebus (season 1; guest season 2), a host and bandit programmed to kill Dolores's father\n* [[Ptolemy Slocum]] as Sylvester

He was the son of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Agnes of Poitou]]. After his father's death on 5&nbsp;October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the [[pope]]s, thus the idea of the \"[[Libertas ecclesiae|liberty of the church]]\" strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop [[Anno II of Cologne]] kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065.\n\nHenry decided to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]]. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat, [[Otto of Nordheim]] in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high offices offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogatives relating to the appointment of [[Bishop in the Catholic Church|bishops]] and [[abbot]]s, although the reformist clerics condemned this practice as [[simony]] (a forbidden sale of church offices). [[Pope Alexander II]] blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the [[Holy See]] and the German dukes weakened his position and the [[Saxon Rebellion|Saxons rose up again]] in the summer of 1074. He took advantage of a rift between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry and forced the rebels into submission in October 1075.\n\nHenry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming [[Pope Gregory VII]] who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24&nbsp;January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects from their allegiance. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him at the German leaders' assembly, Henry went to Italy. His penitential \"[[Walk to Canossa]]\" was a success. Gregory&nbsp;VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an [[antiking]], [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], on 14&nbsp;March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7&nbsp;March 1080. Most German and Lombardian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected an [[antipope]], [[Antipope Clement III|Clement&nbsp;III]]. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor, [[Hermann of Salm]], could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement&nbsp;III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1&nbsp;April 1084.\n\nHermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally, [[Matilda of Tuscany]], in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]], to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]] prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement&nbsp;III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but he did not make peace with [[Pope Paschal II]]. Henry proclaimed the first ''[[Landfrieden]]'' (or imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;V]], forced him to abdicate on 31&nbsp;December 1105. He tried to regain his throne with the assistance of Lotharingian aristocrats, but became ill and died without receiving absolution from his excommunication.\n\n==Background==\n\nHenry was the third monarch of the [[Salian dynasty]]\u2014the royal house ruling [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] from 1024 to 1124.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The 11th-century kings of Germany also ruled [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]] and had a strong claim to the title of emperor. They were convinced that their claim to the emperorship entitled them to act as all Christians' paramount rulers and to control [[Papal selection before 1059|papal elections]] in Rome.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=197\u2013198}} Rome was actually dominated by local aristocrats, the [[Counts of Tusculum|Tusculani]] and the [[Crescentii]], who placed their own candidates to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=43\u201344}} Their rivalries caused scandals, culminating when rival popes\u2014[[Pope Benedict&nbsp;IX|Benedict&nbsp;IX]], [[Pope Sylvester III|Sylvester&nbsp;III]] and [[Pope Gregory VI|Gregory&nbsp;VI]]\u2014competed for Rome in 1045.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=44}}{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=56}} To put an end to the [[schism]], Henry's father, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;III]], crossed the [[Alps]] to Italy and held a [[Council of Sutri|Church synod at Sutri]] on 20 December 1046.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The synod deposed the three popes and replaced them with a German prelate, Bishop Suidger of Bamberg, who assumed the name [[Pope Clement II|Clement II]].{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=57}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III emphasized the priestly nature of kingship, attributing it to the kings' annointment by holy oil.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=39}} For all his personal piety, he regarded himself as \"[[Vicar of Christ]]\", authorized to administer state and church alike.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}} The Romans awarded him with the hereditary title of patrician, acknowledging his and his successors' right to cast the first vote at papal elections.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=128}} His new title enabled him to exlude the Roman aristocrats from influencing papal elections and to secure the appointment of German clerics to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=45}} The third German pope, [[Pope Leo IX|Leo&nbsp;IX]], came from [[Lotharingia]]\u2014a province that had been an important center of reformist clerics. They wanted to purify the Church through the re-implementation of ancient (or supposedly ancient) collections of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]] and Leo&nbsp;IX enthusiastically introduced their ideas in Rome. He prohibited simony\u2014the sale of Church offices\u2014and promoted [[Clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church|clerical celibacy]] soon after his entry to Rome.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|pp=64\u201365, 70\u201374}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III's claim to intervene in Church affairs was rarely challenged: reformist bishops convinced him not to extract an oath of fealty from the monk [[Halinard]] who had been elected [[archbishop of Lyon]] in 1045; Bishop [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]] openly denied his right to depose bishops in 1047 or 1048.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=52\u201353}} Imperial control of Church affairs, however, was on the long run incompatible with the reformist idea of \"liberty of the Church\" which claimed that ecclesiastic institutions could only be subject to the authority of the Holy See. The conflict between the two ideas reached its pinnacle during Henry IV's reign, developing into the confrontation known as the [[Investiture Controversy]].{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=87\u201391}}\n\nGermany, Italy and Burgundy were no more than collections of semi-independent territories, each administered by a prelate or a lay aristocrat, under the Salian monarchs.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=2}} The prelates\u2014the bishops and abbots\u2014were not only wealthy landowners, but they also played an important role in state administration. They were required to make annual gifts to the kings and also to provide the monarchs with well-defined regular services, including the collection of taxes and hospitality.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=36}} The dukes were the most powerful lay aristocrats in Germany. They were primarily military commanders, but they were also responsible for the administration of justice. The dukes were the principal representatives of the people of their duchies in the royal court, but the monarchs expected the dukes to be primarily their agents.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=2\u20133}} The monarchs occasionally kept the office of duke for themselves or for their closest relatives, but sooner or later they had no choice, but to give away the vacant duchies, because they depended on the most powerful aristocrats' support.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=41}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III came into conflict with influential dukes towards the end of his life. [[Godfrey the Bearded]], [[Duke of Upper Lotharingia]], married a wealthy widow, [[Beatrice of Lorraine|Beatrice of Tuscany]], without the Emperor's consent after the Emperor denied to invest him with whole Lotharingia. Henry&nbsp;III also outraged the Saxon duke, [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Bernard II]], because he supported the duke's main rival, Archbishop [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], to seize Saxon counties.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=41\u201342}} The Salian kings who inherited their [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessors' domains in Saxony visited the province frequently. Their lengthy visits irritated the Saxon aristocrats who were exposed to direct royal control for more time than their peers in other parts of the empire. The Saxons' grievances against the Salian monarchs broke out in a series of revolts during Henry&nbsp;IV's reign.{{sfn|Leyser|1982|p=94}}\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn on 11 November 1050, Henry was the son of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], Henry III, by his second wife, [[Agnes of Poitou]].{{sfn|Hill|2020|p=93}} Henry was most likely born in his father's [[Imperial Palace of Goslar|palace]] at [[Goslar]].{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}} His birth had been long-awaited; Henry III had fathered four daughters, but his subjects were convinced only a male heir could secure the \"peace of kingdom\" (as [[Hermann II, Archbishop of Cologne]] called it in a sermon).{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}}{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}} Henry was first named for his grandfather, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor]], but Abbot [[Hugh of Cluny]], whom Henry&nbsp;III had appointed as his son's [[Godparent|godfather]], convinced the Emperor to give his name to his heir.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}} At Christmas 1050 the ailing Henry&nbsp;III designated his infant son as his successor in [[P\u00f6hlde]] (in Saxony).{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=20\u201321}} On this occasion, the Emperor also \"caused many of the princes\"\u2014most probably the Saxon and Thuringian aristocrats\u2014\"to promise an oath of fidelity and submission\" to Henry.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nArchbishop Hermann baptised Henry in [[Cologne]] on Easter day 1051.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}} In November, the Emperor held an assembly at [[Tribur]] to secure his son's succession.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=21}} The German princes who attended the meeting elected the one-year-old king. They stipulated they would acknowledge him as his father's successor only if he acted as a \"just ruler\" during his father's lifetime.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=21}} Historian Ian S. Robinson supposes the princes actually wanted to persuade Henry&nbsp;III to change his methods of government since the child king had no role in state administration.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} At Christmas 1052, the Emperor made Henry the duke of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]].{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}}\n\nArchbishop Hermann crowned Henry king in [[Aachen]] on 17&nbsp;July 1054.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} On this occasion, Henry's two-year-old younger brother, [[Conrad II, Duke of Bavaria|Conrad]], most likely received Bavaria from their father.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} When Conrad died in 1055, the Emperor gave Bavaria to Empress Agnes.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=28, 98}} The Emperor betrothed Henry to [[Bertha of Savoy]] in late 1055.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=25}} Her parents, [[Adelaide of Susa|Adelaide, Margravine of Turin]], and [[Otto, Count of Savoy]], controlled north-western Italy.

They convinced [[Otto, Margrave of the Nordmark|Otto of Nordmark]], who had recently returned from exile, to mount a coup.

In early February 1106, he fled to Cologne where he was received by the townspeople with great respect. He declined all ceremonies, demonstrating that he was doing penance for his sins. His loyal supporter, [[Othbert, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge]], made peace with Henry of Limburg to secure the Duke's support.

Both his supporters and his opponents based their portraits of Henry on two early medieval works: ''[[De duodecim abusivis saeculi|The Twelve Abuses]]'' contained a discussion about legitimate kingship, while [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae|Etymologies]]'' contrasted kingship with tyranny. Consequently, polemical literature tended to provide a list of the characteristics of either good or wicked rulers when portraying Henry. For instance, in the 1080s, the ''[[Song of the Saxon War]]'' praised him as a \"king second to none in his piety\" who defended the widows and the poor and gave laws to the lawless Saxons. An anonymous biography, completed in the early 1110s, described him as a vigorous and warlike monarch who employed learned officials and enjoyed conversations about spiritual themes and the [[liberal arts]]. In contrast [[Lambert of Hersfeld]] stated Henry had inherited a peaceful realm, but he \"rendered it filthy, despicable, bloodstrained, a prey to internal conflicts\". Lambert also emphasised that Henry destroyed and robbed churches and put freemen into servitude.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=345\u2013348}}\n\nRumours of Henry's immorality established his bad reputation for centuries.{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|pp=65\u201366}} The Saxons were the first to accuse him of debauchery and demanded he dismiss the \"swarm of concubines with whom he slept\".{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=89, 113}} Polemical writings spreading in Germany after 1085 accused Henry of [[incest]] and [[pederasty]], also claiming that he had fathered illegitimate children.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=113}} Isidore of Seville listed immoral sexual practices among the tyrants' characteristics.{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|pp=65\u201366}} Consequently, as Robinson emphasises, allegations of Henry's alleged sexual misconduct \"provided his opponents with a useful polemical weapon\".{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=113}}\n\nHenry was not a successful military commander, primarily because he did not avoid pitched battles in contrast with most 11th-century military leaders.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=349}} He could likely adopt this high-risk strategy because he often mustered his troops from among merchants and peasants who were regarded as expendable.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=350}} He lost most of his major battles; his sole victory at Homburg was primarily attributed to Rudolf of Rheinfelden by their contemporaries.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=349\u2013350}}\n\n==Family==\n\n[[File:Henry IV and Bertha of Savoy.jpg|thumb|middle|Henry IV and his first wife, Bertha of Savoy (11th-century painting).]]\n\nHenry's first wife, Bertha of Savoy, was a year younger than him.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=266}} Until 5&nbsp;August 1068, Henry regularly mentioned her as \"consort of our kingdom and our marriage-bed\" in his diplomas.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=109\u2013110}} Her disappearance from the diplomas was the sign of a growing disaffection.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=109}} Henry sought a divorce at a general assembly in June 1069 stating their marriage had not been [[Consummation|consummated]].{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=147}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=109}} The assembled German aristocrats referred his request to a synod, which passed the matter to the Holy See in early October.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=109\u2013110}} Henry's request outraged Pope Alexander II.

He was the son of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Agnes of Poitou]]. After his father's death on 5&nbsp;October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the [[pope]]s, thus the idea of the \"[[Libertas ecclesiae|liberty of the church]]\" strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop [[Anno II of Cologne]] kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065.\n\nHenry decided to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]]. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat, [[Otto of Nordheim]] in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high offices offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogatives relating to the appointment of [[Bishop in the Catholic Church|bishops]] and [[abbot]]s, although the reformist clerics condemned this practice as [[simony]] (a forbidden sale of church offices). [[Pope Alexander II]] blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the [[Holy See]] and the German dukes weakened his position and the [[Saxon Rebellion|Saxons rose up again]] in the summer of 1074. He took advantage of a rift between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry and forced the rebels into submission in October 1075.\n\nHenry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming [[Pope Gregory VII]] who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24&nbsp;January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects from their allegiance. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him at the German leaders' assembly, Henry went to Italy. His penitential \"[[Walk to Canossa]]\" was a success. Gregory&nbsp;VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an [[antiking]], [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], on 14&nbsp;March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7&nbsp;March 1080. Most German and Lombardian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected an [[antipope]], [[Antipope Clement III|Clement&nbsp;III]]. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor, [[Hermann of Salm]], could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement&nbsp;III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1&nbsp;April 1084.\n\nHermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally, [[Matilda of Tuscany]], in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]], to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]] prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement&nbsp;III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but he did not make peace with [[Pope Paschal II]]. Henry proclaimed the first ''[[Landfrieden]]'' (or imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;V]], forced him to abdicate on 31&nbsp;December 1105.

Consequently, polemical literature tended to provide a list of the characteristics of either good or wicked rulers when portraying Henry. For instance, in the 1080s, the ''[[Song of the Saxon War]]'' praised him as a \"king second to none in his piety\" who defended the widows and the poor and gave laws to the lawless Saxons. An anonymous biography, completed in the early 1110s, described him as a vigorous and warlike monarch who employed learned officials and enjoyed conversations about spiritual themes and the [[liberal arts]].

He supported the postal survey because he believed that the institution of marriage, since it existed before the parliament, was an institution that belonged to people, so it was right for the people themselves to vote on it. When the \"yes vote\" was strongly returned, Hastie ensured passage of the bill, but could not vote for it himself. He explained, \"We went to the election with it, I was on television saying I would abstain, I've been in dialogue with constituents for the last 18 months and whenever I've talked to them about the issue, I've said I would abstain. My intention is to abstain because to vote yes would go against my conscience, but I want to uphold both the vote in Canning and the national result and abstention is the best way to do that.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mandurahmail.com.au/story/5058727/hastie-to-abstain-on-yes-vote/|title=Hastie to abstain on 'yes' vote|last=Hondros|first=Nathan|date=2017-11-15|website=Mandurah Mail|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> Most of Hastie's statements through the public debate centred not on marriage, but on how to have the debate. When right wing commentators such as Larry Pickering used homophobic language towards [[LGBT]] persons, Hastie immediately condemned the statement, expressing his \"dismay\" at the degrading language, and pleaded for \"higher personal and civic standards\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/pickering-comments-despicable-hastie|title=Pickering comments despicable: Hastie|website=SBS News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of conscience - on military abuses ====\nRecent reports by Chris Masters and others of prisoner abuse, and even killings, by the Australian [[Special Air Service Regiment]] in Afghanistan have seen Hastie come forward as a strong advocate for transparency, though it may hurt the prestige of his former unit. He has \"emerged as a champion of the Brereton Inquiry.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/he-thought-i-was-going-to-shoot-him-how-david-s-little-voice-saved-him-in-war-20190913-p52qy6.html|title='He thought I was going to shoot him': How David's 'little voice' saved him in war|last=Masters|first=Nick McKenzie, Chris|date=2019-09-20|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> He strongly supports whistleblowers when it comes to abuse, telling ABC Radio the truth tellers should be respected: \"I don't want to go into any specific allegations, but they should be taken seriously and, as I said, we want a free media reporting on all issues.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/secretive-and-elite-sas-soldiers-grilled-about-alleged-war-crimes-20180608-p4zkau.html|title=Secretive and elite SAS soldiers grilled about alleged war crimes|last=Wroe|first=Nick McKenzie, David|date=2018-06-08|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of expression ====\nIn one of Hastie's first electoral campaigns, he had a large outdoor poster vandalised. Rather than condemn the culprit, he wrote a Facebook message, \"Will Mandurah's Van Gogh please come forward<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mandurahmail.com.au/story/3985723/hasties-spray-mp-responds-to-graffiti-attack/|title=Hastie's spray: MP responds to graffiti attack|last=Hondros|first=Nathan|date=2016-06-22|website=Mandurah Mail|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> then had a local graffiti artist add even more colour to the piece.

He has actively stood up for journalists at the ABC and [[Sydney morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]], using Parliamentary privilege to name Chau Chak Wing as a man who co-conspired to bribe a UN official, a man who took the media outlets to court for defamation as they had published the accusations. Hastie explained his actions by saying \"...democracy works only if we have a free press that can publish information that serves the public interest.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-23/turnbull-did-not-know-hastie-would-make-chau-chak-wing-claims/9790476|title=Liberal MP says he did his duty in speaking up about political donor|last=Yaxley|first=political reporters Louise|last2=Gribbin|first2=Caitlyn|date=2018-05-23|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-18|last3=Conifer|first3=Dan}}</ref> However, current laws have allowed for the Australian Federal Police to raid journalists from the ABC and News Corp Australia for reasons of security. This places a tension between freedom and sovereignty.\n\n==== Freedom of religion ====\nWhile an observant Christian, Hastie holds to the view that if the law allows him to practice his faith, it must allow all to express their faith, or lack of it. That means that traditional Muslim families must be allowed to have women wear the burka in public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-02/keeping-the-faith-andrew-hastie/8477382|title=Andrew Hastie on poetry, political courage, and not banning the burka|last=Alexandra Beech|date=2017-05-02|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Sovereignty ===\n[[File:Andrew Hastie MP with Mayor Rhys Williams at March 2020 Citizenship Ceremony in Mandurah photo taken by D Birch.jpg|thumb|The Mayor of Mandurah, Rhys Williams, with Andrew Hastie MP, hosting an Australian Citizenship ceremony in March 2020]]\nHastie has argued that only Australia should make decisions that affect Australia's future or the working of our institutions. As such he strongly resists foreign influence on the working of the Australian economy, culture or political system. \"My bottom line is Australian sovereignty \u2013 I want to protect our way of life, our freedom of action and our political institutions. That's my job as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. I make no apologies for it.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-a-dead-spy-chinese-hackers-and-the-australian-commando-warning-israel-1.8223349|title=A Dead Spy, Chinese Hackers and the Australian Commando Warning Israel|date=2019-12-06|work=Haaretz|access-date=2019-12-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Economic sovereignty ====\nInterestingly, Hastie locates the energy debates within the concern for Australian sovereignty, and it was this issue that meant he could never support the [[National Energy Guarantee]]. In August 2018, he posted his position: \"My priority is Australia's economic sovereignty and affordable power prices. Here I stand.\" The next month he made a speech in the Federation Chamber, saying, \"Australian industry and Australian workers must come first. When it comes to energy, we must put the Australian people before Paris.\"\n\n==== Sovereignty and political warfare ====\nThis has been the main legislative focus for Hastie in recent times. In an interview with the Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'', Hastie explained that, \"Democratic countries must take domestic measures to protect against these threats. Australia has led the way in this regard. Authoritarian states use all instruments of state power to pursue their strategic objectives. Seemingly innocent activities like diplomacy, foreign-investment flows into strategic industries and infrastructure acquisitions like the purchase of ports are not so innocuous. Democracies who don't pay attention to these activities \u2013 and take measures to guard against them \u2013 risk becoming tethered to hyper-modern authoritarian states and losing their sovereignty in the process.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\"/>\n\n==== Digital sovereignty ====\nHastie frames questions to do with the provision of information networks as a matter of sovereignty, which must be defended. Given that companies such as Huawei would be legally required to pass on information carried on their networks to the Chinese government,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/05/huawei-would-have-to-give-data-to-china-government-if-asked-experts.html|title=Huawei says it would never hand data to China's government.

Along with other parliamentarians from the Liberal Party, including [[Tim Wilson (Australian politician)|Tim Wilson]] and [[James Paterson (Australian politician)|James Paterson]] and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor's]] [[Kimberley Kitching]] and [[Anthony Byrne (politician)|Anthony Byrne]], he has been active in applying pressure to Australia's partners in the [[Five Eyes]] security alliance to do the same. In a public statement he explained how important that security arrangement is, \"In a time of growing strategic uncertainty, Australia values that membership more than ever.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/four-australian-mps-urge-britain-to-ban-huawei-20200124-p53u9x.html|title=Four Australian MPs urge Britain to ban Huawei|last=Bourke|first=Latika|date=2020-01-23|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> In private settings, it is known that he has supported Byrne, the Deputy Chair of the committee Hastie leads, who used forceful language with the UK leadership, asking \u201cHow would you feel if the Russians laid down infrastructure in your own networks?

In an interview about his wartime experiences, he said:<blockquote> For me, it proved that culture and geography (are) decisive in the formation of societies and political institutions. Building lasting, trusted institutions takes time, generations of stewardship and public virtue.<ref name=\"Whinnett\"/></blockquote>\n[[File:Andrew Hastie MP with son Jonathan at the 2018 ANZAC Day March in Mandurah WA taken by D Birch.jpg|thumb|Holding the hand of his son, Jonathan, Andrew Hastie marches with members of the veteran community in Mandurah, [[Anzac Day]] 2019]]\n Looking at Australia, Hastie believes that it is local institutions that provide civic foundations of \"accountability, freedom and democracy.\"<ref name=\"First Speech\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrewhastie.com.au/first_speech|title=First Speech|website=Andrew Hastie MP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> He argued in his first speech that the first of these institutions is the family, which \"is central to a healthy society\"<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> but also extends to sporting clubs, service clubs, churches and local businesses.<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> In one op-ed, Hastie went even further, suggesting that community groups, or \"pre-political institutions\" are finally more important than governments:<blockquote> \"More powerful than the political levers of government are grassroots volunteer movements and pre-political institutions...

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

He explained, \"We went to the election with it, I was on television saying I would abstain, I've been in dialogue with constituents for the last 18 months and whenever I've talked to them about the issue, I've said I would abstain.

Hastie explained his actions by saying \"...democracy works only if we have a free press that can publish information that serves the public interest.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-23/turnbull-did-not-know-hastie-would-make-chau-chak-wing-claims/9790476|title=Liberal MP says he did his duty in speaking up about political donor|last=Yaxley|first=political reporters Louise|last2=Gribbin|first2=Caitlyn|date=2018-05-23|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-18|last3=Conifer|first3=Dan}}</ref> However, current laws have allowed for the Australian Federal Police to raid journalists from the ABC and News Corp Australia for reasons of security. This places a tension between freedom and sovereignty.\n\n==== Freedom of religion ====\nWhile an observant Christian, Hastie holds to the view that if the law allows him to practice his faith, it must allow all to express their faith, or lack of it. That means that traditional Muslim families must be allowed to have women wear the burka in public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-02/keeping-the-faith-andrew-hastie/8477382|title=Andrew Hastie on poetry, political courage, and not banning the burka|last=Alexandra Beech|date=2017-05-02|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Sovereignty ===\n[[File:Andrew Hastie MP with Mayor Rhys Williams at March 2020 Citizenship Ceremony in Mandurah photo taken by D Birch.jpg|thumb|The Mayor of Mandurah, Rhys Williams, with Andrew Hastie MP, hosting an Australian Citizenship ceremony in March 2020]]\nHastie has argued that only Australia should make decisions that affect Australia's future or the working of our institutions. As such he strongly resists foreign influence on the working of the Australian economy, culture or political system. \"My bottom line is Australian sovereignty \u2013 I want to protect our way of life, our freedom of action and our political institutions. That's my job as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. I make no apologies for it.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-a-dead-spy-chinese-hackers-and-the-australian-commando-warning-israel-1.8223349|title=A Dead Spy, Chinese Hackers and the Australian Commando Warning Israel|date=2019-12-06|work=Haaretz|access-date=2019-12-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Economic sovereignty ====\nInterestingly, Hastie locates the energy debates within the concern for Australian sovereignty, and it was this issue that meant he could never support the [[National Energy Guarantee]]. In August 2018, he posted his position: \"My priority is Australia's economic sovereignty and affordable power prices. Here I stand.\" The next month he made a speech in the Federation Chamber, saying, \"Australian industry and Australian workers must come first. When it comes to energy, we must put the Australian people before Paris.\"\n\n==== Sovereignty and political warfare ====\nThis has been the main legislative focus for Hastie in recent times. In an interview with the Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'', Hastie explained that, \"Democratic countries must take domestic measures to protect against these threats. Australia has led the way in this regard. Authoritarian states use all instruments of state power to pursue their strategic objectives. Seemingly innocent activities like diplomacy, foreign-investment flows into strategic industries and infrastructure acquisitions like the purchase of ports are not so innocuous. Democracies who don't pay attention to these activities \u2013 and take measures to guard against them \u2013 risk becoming tethered to hyper-modern authoritarian states and losing their sovereignty in the process.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\"/>\n\n==== Digital sovereignty ====\nHastie frames questions to do with the provision of information networks as a matter of sovereignty, which must be defended. Given that companies such as Huawei would be legally required to pass on information carried on their networks to the Chinese government,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/05/huawei-would-have-to-give-data-to-china-government-if-asked-experts.html|title=Huawei says it would never hand data to China's government.

Along with other parliamentarians from the Liberal Party, including [[Tim Wilson (Australian politician)|Tim Wilson]] and [[James Paterson (Australian politician)|James Paterson]] and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor's]] [[Kimberley Kitching]] and [[Anthony Byrne (politician)|Anthony Byrne]], he has been active in applying pressure to Australia's partners in the [[Five Eyes]] security alliance to do the same. In a public statement he explained how important that security arrangement is, \"In a time of growing strategic uncertainty, Australia values that membership more than ever.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/four-australian-mps-urge-britain-to-ban-huawei-20200124-p53u9x.html|title=Four Australian MPs urge Britain to ban Huawei|last=Bourke|first=Latika|date=2020-01-23|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> In private settings, it is known that he has supported Byrne, the Deputy Chair of the committee Hastie leads, who used forceful language with the UK leadership, asking \u201cHow would you feel if the Russians laid down infrastructure in your own networks?

In an interview about his wartime experiences, he said:<blockquote> For me, it proved that culture and geography (are) decisive in the formation of societies and political institutions. Building lasting, trusted institutions takes time, generations of stewardship and public virtue.<ref name=\"Whinnett\"/></blockquote> Looking at Australia, Hastie believes that it is local institutions that provide civic foundations of \"accountability, freedom and democracy.\"<ref name=\"First Speech\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrewhastie.com.au/first_speech|title=First Speech|website=Andrew Hastie MP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> He argued in his first speech that the first of these institutions is the family, which \"is central to a healthy society\"<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> but also extends to sporting clubs, service clubs, churches and local businesses.<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> In one op-ed, Hastie went even further, suggesting that community groups, or \"pre-political institutions\" are finally more important than governments:<blockquote> \"More powerful than the political levers of government are grassroots volunteer movements and pre-political institutions... Pre-political institutions are the best place for securing our freedoms and so we should take encouragement that democratic governments cannot control them, and are sent packing when they attempt to do so.\"<ref name=\"theaustralian.com.au\">{{Cite news|last=Hastie|first=Andrew|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/opinion/political-class-ignored-the-people-and-paid-the-price/news-story/f1d35ad7c29f76daf08768182b316d55|title=Political class ignored the people and paid the price|date=November 23, 2016|work=The Australian|access-date=February 12, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== The power of community and PTSD ====\nHastie reflected on how his grandfather recovered from the trauma of [[World War II]] thanks, in part to the power of community, and laments that we may not have that power available to us now, \"Just thinking of my grandfather's own experience, he was shot up quite badly in the second world war where civil society was still very strong, community was still very strong, a lot of local clubs and organisations, I think he struggled with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] but I think his PTSD was mitigated by those little platoons that we talk about, he was very close to his comrades from the second war, and I'm just not sure if we have in today's society that same sort of cushioning and community support as we had 70 years ago.\"<ref name=\"Grattan\"/>\n\n==== Community and environment ====\nWhile environmental concern is often seen as a progressive cause, Hastie sets the environment between two concerns - that, as per the [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] contract - the good things inherited should be passed on to the next generation. And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].
