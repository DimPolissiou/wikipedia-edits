The city, nicknamed \"The River City\", is located in [[North Alabama|Northern Alabama]] on the banks of [[Wheeler Lake]], along the [[Tennessee River]]. It is the largest city and county seat of Morgan County.<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-31 }}</ref>  The population in 2010 was 55,683.<ref name=popest/>\n\nDecatur is also the core city of the two-county large [[Decatur metropolitan area, Alabama|Decatur, Alabama metropolitan area]] which had an estimated population of 153,374 in 2013. Combined with the [[Huntsville Metropolitan Area]], the two create the [[Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area]], of which Decatur is the second-largest city.\n\nLike many southern cities in the early 19th century, Decatur's early success was based upon its location along a river. Railroad routes and boating traffic pushed the city to the front of [[North Alabama]]'s  economic atmosphere. The city rapidly grew into a large economic center within the [[Tennessee Valley]] and was a hub for travelers and cargo between [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], as well as [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. Throughout the 20th century, the city experienced steady growth, but was eclipsed as the regional economic center by the fast-growing [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] during the [[space race]]. The city now finds its economy heavily based on manufacturing, mining, cargo transit, chemical, and high-tech companies such as [[Vulcan Materials]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulcanmaterials.com/construction-materials/facilities-map/FindByLocation|accessdate=2019-03-08 |title=Vulcan: Construction Materials |publisher=Vulcan Materials}}</ref> [[Daikin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://daikin-america.com/decatur-al/|accessdate=2019-03-08 |title=Daikin America|publisher=Daikin}}</ref> [[Toray]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jobs.toraycma.com/|accessdate=2019-03-08 |title=Toray Composite Materials America, INC.|publisher=Toray}}</ref>  and [[United Launch Alliance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madeinalabama.com/2018/09/ula-selects-blue-origin-engines-for-vulcan-rocket-in-boost-for-alabama/|accessdate=2019-03-08 |title=ULA selects Blue Origin engines for Vulcan rocket in boost for Alabama |publisher=United Launch Alliance}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Albany, Alabama}}\nInitially the area was known as \"Rhodes Ferry Landing\", named for Dr. Henry W. Rhodes, an early landowner who operated a ferry that crossed the [[Tennessee River]] in the 1810s at the present-day location of Rhodes Ferry Park. The city was incorporated as Decatur in 1821. It was named in honor of [[Stephen Decatur]]; after he was killed in a duel in 1820, President Monroe directed that the Alabama town be named for him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/ddg73/Pages/namesake.aspx |accessdate=2019-02-13 |title=USS Decatur |publisher=US Navy  }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1830s, Decatur was the eastern terminus of the [[Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur Railroad]], the first railway built west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. In 1850 the Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur Railroad was incorporated into the [[Memphis & Charleston Railroad]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sherrod |first1=Phillip |title=The Tuscumbia, Courtland & Decatur Railway |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323221625/http://www.wheelerplantation.org/tc%26d.htm |website=Wheeler Plantatation: Preserving our Past |publisher=Friends of the Joe Wheeler Foundation}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Old State Bank Decatur July 2010 02.jpg|thumb|left|Old State Bank]]\nBecause of its location on the Tennessee River at the strategically important crossing of two major railroads, Decatur was the site of several encounters during the [[American Civil War]]. When the Union army occupied the city early in the war, the commanding general ordered all but four buildings in the town destroyed. Bricks from some of the churches in town were used to build stoves and chimneys for the buildings that housed soldiers. The four buildings that remained (and are still standing) are the [[State Bank Building, Decatur Branch (Old State Bank)|Old State Bank]], the Dancy-Polk House, the Todd House, and the [[Burleson-Hinds-McEntire House]]. After the Union victory in the [[Battle of Atlanta]], a Confederate army under the command of [[John Bell Hood|Gen. John Bell Hood]] briefly sparred with a vastly outmanned garrison during the 1864 [[Battle of Decatur]], when Decatur was referred to as ''A Tough Nut To Crack.''{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[File:Monuments at the Morgan County Alabama Courthouse June 2013 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Confederate statue at Morgan County Courthouse in Decatur]]\nWhile the city was under Confederate control, plans for the [[Battle of Shiloh]] were mapped out within the Burleson-Hinds-McEntire House. These activities make the house one of the most historic buildings in Decatur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theclio.com/web/entry?id=11008 |accessdate=2019-02-14 |title=Rhea-McIntire House |publisher=The Clio  }}</ref>\n\n[[Albany, Alabama|New Decatur, Alabama]] was a city that rose out of the ashes of former Decatur west of the railroad tracks. New Decatur was founded in 1887 and incorporated in 1889. However, residents of the older Decatur resented the new town, founded and occupied by people who moved down from northern states. Animosity built until New Decatur renamed their town Albany, after Albany, N.Y., in September 1916. The impetus to meld the two towns came from the need for a bridge, instead of a ferry, across the Tennessee River. The Decatur Kiwanis Club was formed with an equal number of members from each town to organize efforts to get the state to build the bridge. In 1925, the two cities merged to form one City of Decatur. There is a noticeable difference between the two sides of town. The cities developed differently at different times, and still to this day have somewhat different cultures. Eastern portions of Decatur tend to act more suburban and traditional, while western portions tend to look more metropolitan and contemporary.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe [[State Bank Building, Decatur Branch (Old State Bank)|Old State Bank]], on the edge of downtown, is the oldest bank building in the State of [[Alabama]], being 173 years old. The first wave pool in the [[United States]] was built in Decatur and is still in operation at the [[Point Mallard Aquatic Center]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pointmallardpark.com/water-park/|title=Water Park|website=Point Mallard Park}}</ref>  The city has the largest [[Victorian era]] home district in the state of Alabama. Decatur is also home to Alabama's oldest opera house, the [[Cotaco Opera House]], which still stands on Johnston Street.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn the past, its industries included repair shops of the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]], car works, engine works, bottling plants, and manufacturers of lumber, sashes and blinds, tannic acid, fertilizers, cigars, flour, cottonseed oil, and various other products.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[Tennessee River]] has traditionally been the northern border of the city and Morgan County, but a small portion of the city extends across the river into Limestone County between U.S. 31 and I-65. Major bodies of water in the city include [[Wheeler Lake]], Flint Creek, Lake Morgan, and Chula Vista Lake, all estuaries of the Tennessee River. The city does extend to the other side of Flint Creek and the Refuge in the Indian Hills and Burningtree subdivision areas. There is also an inlet that extends one mile (2&nbsp;km) into the city limits from Wheeler Lake called Dry Branch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://adem.alabama.gov/programs/water/wqsurvey/table/2015/2015WHEL-7.pdf|title=Dry Branch Embayment Wheeler Reservoir Intensive Basin Survey 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=Alabama Department of Environmental Management\n(ADEM)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe northern portion of Decatur sits on top of a short hill that overlooks the Tennessee River; this creates a very steep dropoff to the river shore at Rhodes Ferry Park. This hill allows the [[Captain William J. Hudson \"Steamboat Bill\" Memorial Bridge|\"Steamboat Bill\" Memorial Bridge]] to leave the mainland at grade without any major sloping required to cross the river while not interfering with Decatur's heavy barge traffic. This hill extends from the banks of the river about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} south to the 14th St./Magnolia St. intersection with 6th Avenue ([[U.S. Route 31 in Alabama|US 31]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nSouth past the 14th St. and 6th Ave. intersection, land remains flat.

The latter part of summer tends to be drier. Autumn, which spans from mid-September to early-December, tends to be similar to spring in terms of temperature and precipitation, although it begins relatively dry.\n\nPrecipitation averages about 53.4 inches per year and on average, is relatively (and uniformly) heavy from November to July, with December the single wettest month on average; August through October are slightly drier months on average. Occasionally, severe thunderstorms occur. These storms can produce damaging winds and large hail in addition to the usual hazards of lightning and very heavy rain. There is also the risk of [[tornadoes]]. Severe thunderstorms can occur at any time of the year, but are most common during the spring months. A secondary severe weather season peaks in November. Occasionally from July to October, the Decatur area experiences strong winds and/or heavy to excessive rain from tropical disturbances. These commonly make landfall along the Gulf Coast as [[hurricanes]] but lose intensity as they move inland.\n\nThe highest recorded temperature was {{convert|108|\u00b0F|0}} on July 28, 1952 and August 16, 1954, while the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|\u221219|\u00b0F|0}} on January 30, 1966.<ref name = NOAA/>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Decatur, Alabama\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  78\n|Feb record high F =  82\n|Mar record high F =  87\n|Apr record high F =  94\n|May record high F =  99\n|Jun record high F = 105\n|Jul record high F = 108\n|Aug record high F = 108\n|Sep record high F = 105\n|Oct record high F =  97\n|Nov record high F =  86\n|Dec record high F =  80\n|year record high F =108\n|Jan high F = 50.1\n|Feb high F = 54.6\n|Mar high F = 63.9\n|Apr high F = 72.7\n|May high F = 80.4\n|Jun high F = 87.5\n|Jul high F = 90.3\n|Aug high F = 90.3\n|Sep high F = 84.4\n|Oct high F = 73.8\n|Nov high F = 62.9\n|Dec high F = 52.7\n|year high F =72.1\n|Jan low F = 31.0\n|Feb low F = 34.1\n|Mar low F = 40.9\n|Apr low F = 48.7\n|May low F = 58.3\n|Jun low F = 65.6\n|Jul low F = 68.8\n|Aug low F = 67.5\n|Sep low F = 60.3\n|Oct low F = 48.6\n|Nov low F = 39.7\n|Dec low F = 33.6\n|year low F =49.8\n|Jan record low F = \u221219\n|Feb record low F =  \u22124\n|Mar record low F =   7\n|Apr record low F =  20\n|May record low F =  35\n|Jun record low F =  42\n|Jul record low F =  51\n|Aug record low F =  50\n|Sep record low F =  36\n|Oct record low F =  24\n|Nov record low F =   0\n|Dec record low F =  \u22125\n|year record low F= \u221219\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 4.63\n|Feb precipitation inch = 4.77\n|Mar precipitation inch = 4.89\n|Apr precipitation inch = 4.53\n|May precipitation inch = 4.44\n|Jun precipitation inch = 4.50\n|Jul precipitation inch = 4.58\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.55\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.58\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.45\n|Nov precipitation inch = 4.79\n|Dec precipitation inch = 5.67\n|source 1 = NOAA,<ref name = NOAA/> The Weather Channel (extremes)<ref name=\"twc\">{{cite web| url = http://www.weather.com/outlook/events/sports/wxclimatology/monthly/35603| title = Monthly Averages for Decatur, AL| publisher = [[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]]| date = June 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121023085756/http://www.weather.com/outlook/events/sports/wxclimatology/monthly/35603| archivedate = 2012-10-23}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n===Neighboring cities/towns===\n* [[Athens, Alabama|Athens]] (north) - Limestone County\n* [[Hartselle, Alabama|Hartselle]] (south) - Morgan County\n* [[Hillsboro, Alabama|Hillsboro]] (west) - Lawrence County\n* [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] (northeast) - Madison/Limestone Counties\n* [[Madison, Alabama|Madison]] (northeast) - Madison/Limestone Counties\n* [[Mooresville, Alabama|Mooresville]] (northeast) - Limestone County\n* [[Moulton, Alabama|Moulton]] (southwest) - Lawrence County\n* [[Priceville, Alabama|Priceville]] (east) - Morgan County\n* [[Trinity, Alabama|Trinity]] (west) - Morgan County\n\n===Neighborhoods===\nDecatur is divided into four different regions of town (Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, Southwest).

The Public Safety annex is located at 4119 Old Highway 31 in the Flint Community at the south end of the city and houses the Fire Department's administrative offices. This is also the site of the fire and police training facilities. The Police and Fire Departments currently cover approx. {{convert|130|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} in and around the city. Both the Decatur Police and Decatur Fire & Rescue are dispatched by the Morgan County E-911 Center.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The Decatur Police Department consists of approx. 140 officers, assigned to 4 divisions (Operations, Traffic, Investigations, & Administration). The current Chief of Police is Nate Allen.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Decatur Fire & Rescue is an Advanced Life Support, full service department consisting of approx. 150 firefighters. The department currently runs 7 Engine Companies (with 3 in reserve), 1 Ladder Company (with 1 in reserve), 1 Heavy Rescue (which also responds as part of AL-TF3), 1 Brush Truck, 1 HazMat Unit, 1 Battalion Chief Vehicle, and several other staff and support vehicles out of 8 Fire Stations. The current Fire Chief is Anthony Grande.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\nDecatur also hosts all 3 stations for the Morgan County Rescue Squad, an all volunteer organization who responds to water, cave and high angle rope rescues all throughout Morgan County. They operate with 3 trucks, 6 boats, a small squad car, and 3 rescue trailers.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Emergency medical services and healthcare===\nDecatur is served by First Response EMS, which began operations in July 2012. First Response is a private company contracted through the city of Decatur to provide emergency medical services. Huntsville MedFlight, a division of [[Air Methods]], and [[Air Evac Lifeteam]] provide aeromedical services for the city of Decatur and North Alabama.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nDecatur is served by two hospitals, Decatur General Hospital and Parkway Medical Center. Decatur General Hospital is a 273-bed, general acute care hospital and a 64-bed behavioral medicine hospital making it the third largest employer in Morgan County. Decatur General is accredited by the Joint Commission and its medical staff consists of more than 200 physicians representing 20 specialties. Decatur General Hospital is designated as a level two trauma center by the Alabama Department of Public Health. Parkway Medical Center is a 120-bed hospital that is designated as a level three trauma center by the Alabama Department of Public Health. As of January 1, 2012, [[Huntsville Hospital]] is the full owner of Parkway Medical Center. Parkway was formally a private not-for-profit hospital until their purchase from the public Huntsville Hospital System. [[Huntsville Hospital]] is the region's referral center and also serves as North Alabama's level one trauma center. As of November 2010, Decatur General Hospital and [[Huntsville Hospital]] are affiliate hospitals, ensuring the continued tradition and excellence of public, not-for-profit health care in North Alabama.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Joseph Abbott (Texas politician)|Joseph Abbott]], Texas politician\n*[[Richard W.

The city, nicknamed \"The River City\", is located in [[North Alabama|Northern Alabama]] on the banks of [[Wheeler Lake]], along the [[Tennessee River]]. It is the largest city and county seat of Morgan County.<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-31 }}</ref>  The population in 2010 was 55,683.<ref name=popest/>\n\nDecatur is also the core city of the two-county large [[Decatur metropolitan area, Alabama|Decatur, Alabama metropolitan area]] which had an estimated population of 153,374 in 2013. Combined with the [[Huntsville Metropolitan Area]], the two create the [[Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area]], of which Decatur is the second-largest city.\n\nLike many southern cities in the early 19th century, Decatur's early success was based upon its location along a river. Railroad routes and boating traffic pushed the city to the front of [[North Alabama]]'s  economic atmosphere. The city rapidly grew into a large economic center within the [[Tennessee Valley]] and was a hub for travelers and cargo between [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], as well as [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. Throughout the 20th century, the city experienced steady growth, but was eclipsed as the regional economic center by the fast-growing [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] during the [[space race]]. The city now finds its economy heavily based on manufacturing, mining, cargo transit, chemical, and high-tech companies such as [[Vulcan Materials]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulcanmaterials.com/construction-materials/facilities-map/FindByLocation|accessdate=2019-03-08 |title=Vulcan: Construction Materials |publisher=Vulcan Materials}}</ref> [[Daikin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://daikin-america.com/decatur-al/|accessdate=2019-03-08 |title=Daikin America|publisher=Daikin}}</ref> [[Toray]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jobs.toraycma.com/|accessdate=2019-03-08 |title=Toray Composite Materials America, INC.|publisher=Toray}}</ref>  and [[United Launch Alliance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madeinalabama.com/2018/09/ula-selects-blue-origin-engines-for-vulcan-rocket-in-boost-for-alabama/|accessdate=2019-03-08 |title=ULA selects Blue Origin engines for Vulcan rocket in boost for Alabama |publisher=United Launch Alliance}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Albany, Alabama}}\nInitially the area was known as \"Rhodes Ferry Landing\", named for Dr. Henry W. Rhodes, an early landowner who operated a ferry that crossed the [[Tennessee River]] in the 1810s at the present-day location of Rhodes Ferry Park. The city was incorporated as Decatur in 1821. It was named in honor of [[Stephen Decatur]]; after he was killed in a duel in 1820, President Monroe directed that the Alabama town be named for him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/ddg73/Pages/namesake.aspx |accessdate=2019-02-13 |title=USS Decatur |publisher=US Navy  }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1830s, Decatur was the eastern terminus of the [[Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur Railroad]], the first railway built west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. In 1850 the Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur Railroad was incorporated into the [[Memphis & Charleston Railroad]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sherrod |first1=Phillip |title=The Tuscumbia, Courtland & Decatur Railway |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323221625/http://www.wheelerplantation.org/tc%26d.htm |website=Wheeler Plantatation: Preserving our Past |publisher=Friends of the Joe Wheeler Foundation}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Old State Bank Decatur July 2010 02.jpg|thumb|left|Old State Bank]]\nBecause of its location on the Tennessee River at the strategically important crossing of two major railroads, Decatur was the site of several encounters during the [[American Civil War]]. When the Union army occupied the city early in the war, the commanding general ordered all but four buildings in the town destroyed. Bricks from some of the churches in town were used to build stoves and chimneys for the buildings that housed soldiers. The four buildings that remained (and are still standing) are the [[State Bank Building, Decatur Branch (Old State Bank)|Old State Bank]], the Dancy-Polk House, the Todd House, and the [[Burleson-Hinds-McEntire House]]. After the Union victory in the [[Battle of Atlanta]], a Confederate army under the command of [[John Bell Hood|Gen. John Bell Hood]] briefly sparred with a vastly outmanned garrison during the 1864 [[Battle of Decatur]], when Decatur was referred to as ''A Tough Nut To Crack.''{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[File:Monuments at the Morgan County Alabama Courthouse June 2013 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Confederate statue at Morgan County Courthouse in Decatur]]\nWhile the city was under Confederate control, plans for the [[Battle of Shiloh]] were mapped out within the Burleson-Hinds-McEntire House. These activities make the house one of the most historic buildings in Decatur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theclio.com/web/entry?id=11008 |accessdate=2019-02-14 |title=Rhea-McIntire House |publisher=The Clio  }}</ref>\n\n[[Albany, Alabama|New Decatur, Alabama]] was a city that rose out of the ashes of former Decatur west of the railroad tracks. New Decatur was founded in 1887 and incorporated in 1889. However, residents of the older Decatur resented the new town, founded and occupied by people who moved down from northern states. Animosity built until New Decatur renamed their town Albany, after Albany, N.Y., in September 1916. The impetus to meld the two towns came from the need for a bridge, instead of a ferry, across the Tennessee River. The Decatur Kiwanis Club was formed with an equal number of members from each town to organize efforts to get the state to build the bridge. In 1925, the two cities merged to form one City of Decatur. There is a noticeable difference between the two sides of town. The cities developed differently at different times, and still to this day have somewhat different cultures. Eastern portions of Decatur tend to act more suburban and traditional, while western portions tend to look more metropolitan and contemporary.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe [[State Bank Building, Decatur Branch (Old State Bank)|Old State Bank]], on the edge of downtown, is the oldest bank building in the State of [[Alabama]], being 173 years old. The first wave pool in the [[United States]] was built in Decatur and is still in operation at the [[Point Mallard Aquatic Center]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pointmallardpark.com/water-park/|title=Water Park|website=Point Mallard Park}}</ref>  The city has the largest [[Victorian era]] home district in the state of Alabama. Decatur is also home to Alabama's oldest opera house, the [[Cotaco Opera House]], which still stands on Johnston Street.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn the past, its industries included repair shops of the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]], car works, engine works, bottling plants, and manufacturers of lumber, sashes and blinds, tannic acid, fertilizers, cigars, flour, cottonseed oil, and various other products.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[Tennessee River]] has traditionally been the northern border of the city and Morgan County, but a small portion of the city extends across the river into Limestone County between U.S. 31 and I-65. Major bodies of water in the city include [[Wheeler Lake]], Flint Creek, Lake Morgan, and Chula Vista Lake, all estuaries of the Tennessee River. The city does extend to the other side of Flint Creek and the Refuge in the Indian Hills and Burningtree subdivision areas. There is also an inlet that extends one mile (2&nbsp;km) into the city limits from Wheeler Lake called Dry Branch.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://adem.alabama.gov/programs/water/wqsurvey/table/2015/2015WHEL-7.pdf|title=Dry Branch Embayment Wheeler Reservoir Intensive Basin Survey 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=Alabama Department of Environmental Management\n(ADEM)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe northern portion of Decatur sits on top of a short hill that overlooks the Tennessee River; this creates a very steep dropoff to the river shore at Rhodes Ferry Park. This hill allows the [[Captain William J. Hudson \"Steamboat Bill\" Memorial Bridge|\"Steamboat Bill\" Memorial Bridge]] to leave the mainland at grade without any major sloping required to cross the river while not interfering with Decatur's heavy barge traffic. This hill extends from the banks of the river about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} south to the 14th St./Magnolia St. intersection with 6th Avenue ([[U.S. Route 31 in Alabama|US 31]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nSouth past the 14th St. and 6th Ave. intersection, land remains flat.

The latter part of summer tends to be drier. Autumn, which spans from mid-September to early-December, tends to be similar to spring in terms of temperature and precipitation, although it begins relatively dry.\n\nPrecipitation averages about 53.4 inches per year and on average, is relatively (and uniformly) heavy from November to July, with December the single wettest month on average; August through October are slightly drier months on average. Occasionally, severe thunderstorms occur. These storms can produce damaging winds and large hail in addition to the usual hazards of lightning and very heavy rain.

Hudson \"Steamboat Bill\" Memorial Bridges]]]]\n\nDecatur's main thoroughfares are [[U.S. Route 31]] (6th Avenue), [[U.S. Route 72 Alternate]] ([[Alabama State Route 20|S.R. 20]]), [[Alabama State Route 24|State Route 24]], and [[Alabama State Route 67|State Route 67]]. 6th Avenue begins as both U.S. 72 Alternate and U.S. 31, and the two routes split after being carried by the twin-span [[\"Steamboat Bill\" Hudson Memorial Bridge]] that crosses [[Tennessee River]] at the north central part of town. SR 20/Alternate U.S. 72 continues west towards [[The Shoals]] and [[Florence, Alabama|Florence]]. U.S. 31 connects the city to [[Athens, Alabama|Athens]] in the north, and [[Cullman, Alabama|Cullman]] in the south. A portion of S.R. 67 is known as [[Beltline Road (Decatur, Alabama)|Beltline Road]], and serves as a partial [[beltway]] around the city. [[Interstate 65]] runs east of the city, and connects the area to [[Nashville]] in the north and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] in the south. [[Interstate 565]] begins in Limestone County northeast of the city, and connects to Huntsville.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Transforming U.S. 72 Alternate into an extension of Interstate 565 into the city has been discussed in the past.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/050613/roads.shtml | archive-url = https://archive.today/20070930185738/http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/050613/roads.shtml | url-status=dead | archive-date = 2007-09-30 | title = 3-year transit plan | date = 2005-06-05 | publisher = Decatur Daily Newspaper }}</ref>\n\n=====Major highways=====\n*[[Image:I-65.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 65 (Alabama)|Interstate 65]]\n*[[Image:I-565.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 565]]\n*[[Image:US 31.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 31 (Alabama)|U.S. Highway 31]]\n*[[Image:Alternate plate.svg|20px]]<br />[[Image:US 72.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 72 Alternate]]\n*[[Image:Alabama 20.svg|20px]] [[State Route 20 (Alabama)|SR 20]]\n*[[Image:Alabama 24.svg|20px]] [[State Route 24 (Alabama)|SR 24]]\n*[[Image:Alabama 67.svg|20px]] [[State Route 67 (Alabama)|SR 67]]\n\n====Water (River)====\nLarge shipments can move from Decatur to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via the [[Tennessee River]] to the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

CSX operates a yard downtown. Norfolk Southern main line is the Memphis District East End. The line runs from [[Sheffield, Alabama]] to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The rest of the line, west of Sheffield to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], is the Memphis District West End. The line receives [[trackage rights]] in [[Stevenson, Alabama]] from CSX on their Chattanooga Subdivision to Chattanooga.\n\nUntil 1971 the [[Southern Railway Depot (Decatur, Alabama)|Decatur Union Depot]] was served by several [[Louisville and Nashville]] trains originating in [[Chicago]] or [[Cincinnati]] and terminating at [[New Orleans]] or [[Miami, Florida]] to the south. [[Amtrak]] from 1971 until 1979 operated the ''[[Floridian (train)|Floridian]]'' that made a station stop in Decatur. The [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]] served points to the east and west. The station is now being reconfigured as a museum.<ref>\"Decatur Depot on Alabama's oldest railroad set for $2.5 million renovation, future museum\" AL.com, Jan. 26, 2015 https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2015/01/decatur_historic_train_depot_r.html</ref> CSX eventually absorbed the L&N and Norfolk Southern absorbed the lines formerly held by the Southern Railway.\n\n===Public safety===\n{{update|section|date=November 2017}}\nThe Public Safety Department consists of the Decatur Police Department and Decatur Fire & Rescue.

His godfather was [[Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke Ernst II]] of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].

While some historians have written that Hitler was nursed by Erna (and her mother) at Uffing following the Beer Hall putsch, Toland claims that this is a myth, resulting from the misinterpretation of the American journalists who interviewed the three Hanfstaengl women (the mother, sister and wife of Ernst) immediately after Hitler's arrest by the authorities.

His elder brother Egon served in the German Army in World War I and was killed in 1915; his younger brother Erwine died of [[typhoid]] in the [[American Hospital of Paris|American Hospital]] in Paris in 1914.</ref>\n\nHe attended [[Harvard University]] and became acquainted with [[Walter Lippmann]] and [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]]. A gifted pianist, he composed several songs for Harvard's football team. He graduated in 1909.\n\nHe moved to New York City and took over the management of the American branch of his father's business, the Franz Hanfstaengl Fine Arts Publishing House. On frequent mornings he would practice on the piano at the [[Harvard Club of New York]], where he became acquainted with both [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Among his circle of acquaintances were the newspaper baron [[William Randolph Hearst]], author [[Djuna Barnes]] (to whom he was engaged), and actor [[Charlie Chaplin]].\n\nUpon the outbreak of World War I, he asked the German military attach\u00e9 in New York [[Franz von Papen]] to smuggle him back to Germany. Slightly baffled by the proposal, the attach\u00e9 refused and Hanfstaengl remained in the U.S. during the war. After 1917, the American branch of the family business was confiscated as enemy property.\n\nOn 11 February 1920, Hanfstaengl married Helene Elise Adelheid Niemeyer of [[Long Island]]. Their only son, [[Egon Hanfstaengl|Egon Ludwig]], eventually enlisted in the [[US Army Air Corps]]. A daughter, Hertha, died at the age of five.\n\n==Hitler's confidant==\n[[Image:Putzi Hanfstaengl and Diana Mitford in 1934.jpg|thumb|Hanfstaengl with [[Diana Mitford]] at a 1934 Nuremberg rally.]]\nReturning to Germany in 1922, he was living in his native Bavaria when he first heard Hitler speak in a Munich beer hall.<ref>The initial encounter was on 22 November 1922 at the Kindlkeller, a large L-shaped beer hall. ''Toland'', p. 128.</ref> A fellow member of the Harvard [[Hasty Pudding club]] who worked at the [[Embassy of the United States in Berlin|U.S. Embassy]] asked Hanfstaengl to assist a military attach\u00e9 sent to observe the political scene in Munich. Just before returning to Berlin the attach\u00e9, Captain [[Truman Smith (officer)|Truman Smith]], suggested that Hanfstaengl go to a [[Nazi]] rally as a favor and report his impressions of Hitler. Hanfstaengl was so fascinated by Hitler that he soon became one of his most intimate followers, although he did not formally join the [[Nazi Party]] until 1931. \"What Hitler was able to do to a crowd in 2\u00bd hours will never be repeated in 10,000 years,\" Hanfstaengl said. \"Because of his miraculous throat construction, he was able to create a rhapsody of hysteria. In time, he became the living [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|unknown soldier]] of Germany.\"\n\nHanfstaengl introduced himself to Hitler after the speech and began a close friendship and political association that would last through the 1920s and early 1930s. After participating in the failed Munich [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923, Hanfstaengl briefly fled to Austria, while the injured Hitler sought refuge in Hanfstaengl's home in [[Uffing]], outside of Munich. Hanfstaengl's wife, Helene, allegedly{{fact|date=May 2018}} dissuaded Hitler from committing suicide when the police came to arrest him.\n\nFor much of the 1920s, Hanfstaengl introduced Hitler to Munich high society and helped polish his image. He also helped to finance the publication of Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', and the [[NSDAP]]'s official newspaper, the ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' (People's Observer). Hitler was the godfather of Hanfstaengl's son Egon. Hanfstaengl composed both [[Sturmabteilung|Brownshirt]] and [[Hitler Youth]] marches patterned after his Harvard football songs and, he later claimed, devised the chant \"[[Sieg Heil]]\". Included among Hanfstaengl's friends during this period were [[Hanns Heinz Ewers]] and fellow Nazi Party worker and journalist [[Kurt L\u00fcdecke]].\n\nFluent in English, with many connections to higher society both in the UK and the US, Hanfstaengl became head of the Foreign Press Bureau in Berlin. Aside from this official position, much of his influence was due to his friendship with Hitler, who enjoyed listening to \"Putzi\" play the piano. Hanfstaengl later claimed to have alerted Hitler and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] about the [[Reichstag fire]].\n\nWhen [[Winston Churchill]] was staying at the Hotel Regina in Munich in late August 1932, Hanfstaengl introduced himself and said he could easily arrange a meeting with Hitler there since he came to the hotel every evening around five o'clock. At that time Churchill said he had no national prejudices against Hitler and knew little of his \"doctrine or record and nothing of his character.\" In the course of the conversation with Hanfstaengl, however, Churchill said: \"Why is your chief so violent about the Jews? I can quite understand being angry with the Jews who have done wrong or who are against the country, and I understand resisting them if they try to monopolise power in any walk of life; but what is the sense of being against a man because of his birth? How can a man help how he is born?\" Hanfstaengl, according to Churchill, must have related this to Hitler because the next day, around noon, he came to the hotel to tell him that Hitler would not be coming to see him after all. In addition Hitler may not have wanted to meet with Churchill, who was then out of power and thought to be of no importance.<ref>https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/meeting-hitler-1932/</ref> Churchill declined to meet with Hitler on several subsequent occasions.<ref>''[[The Second World War (book series)|The Gathering Storm]]''. By Winston S. Churchill.

Hanfstaengl was removed from Hitler's staff in 1933. He and Helene divorced in 1936. Hanfstaengl fell completely out of Hitler's favour after he was denounced by [[Unity Mitford]], a close friend of both the Hanfstaengls and Hitler.\n\nIn 1937, Hanfstaengl received orders to parachute into an area held by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|nationalist]] side of the [[Spanish Civil War]], to assist in negotiations. While on board the plane he feared a plot on his life and learned more details from the pilot about the mission, who eventually admitted he had been ordered to drop Hanfstaengl over [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]]-held territory, which would have meant almost certain death. The pilot eventually landed on a small airfield near [[Leipzig]] after claiming an engine malfunction following a brief talk with Hanfstaengl, which allowed him to escape.\n\nThis version of the story was related by [[Albert Speer]] in his memoirs, who stated that the \"mission\" to Spain was an elaborate practical joke, concocted by Hitler and Goebbels, designed to punish Hanfstaengl after he'd displeased the [[F\u00fchrer]] by making \"adverse comments about the fighting spirit of the German soldiers in combat\" in the Spanish Civil War. Hanfstaengl was issued sealed orders from Hitler which were not to be opened until his plane was in flight. These orders detailed that he was to be dropped in \"Red Spanish territory\" to work as an agent for [[Francisco Franco]]. The plane, according to Speer, was merely circling over Germany containing an increasingly disconcerted Hanfstaengl, with false location reports being given to convey the impression that the plane was drawing ever closer to Spain. After the joke had played itself out, the pilot declared he had to make an emergency landing and landed safely at [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport|Leipzig Airport]].<ref>[[Albert Speer]], ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'', (Sphere Books, 1971), Chpt.9, pp. 188-9.</ref> Hanfstaengl was so alarmed by the event that he defected soon afterward.\n\nIn a late 1960s interview at his home in [[Schwabing]] (Munich), Hanfstaengl said he was convinced he was to be tossed out of the plane and parachute over northern Germany.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nHe made his way to Switzerland, and, after securing his son Egon's release from Germany, he moved to Britain, where he was imprisoned after the outbreak of the Second World War. He was later moved to a prison camp in Canada. In 1942, Hanfstaengl was turned over to the U.S. and worked for President Roosevelt's \"S-Project\", revealing information on approximately 400 Nazi leaders. He provided 68 pages of information on Hitler alone, including personal details of Hitler's private life, and he helped Professor [[Henry Murray]], the director of the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] Psychological Clinic, and [[psychoanalyst]] [[Walter Charles Langer]] and other experts to create a report for the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], in 1943, designated the \"[[Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler]]\". In 1944, Hanfstaengl was handed back to the British, who [[repatriation|repatriated]] him to Germany at the end of the war. [[William Shirer]], a [[CBS]] journalist who resided in Nazi Germany until 1940 and was in frequent contact with Hanfstaengl, described him as an \"eccentric, gangling man, whose sardonic wit somewhat compensated for his shallow mind.\"<ref>[[William Shirer]], ''[[Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'', (Simon & Schuster, 1960), Chpt.2, pp. 47.</ref>\n\nHanfstaengl wrote ''Unheard Witness'' (1957) (later re-released as ''Hitler: The Missing Years'') about his experiences. In 1974, Hanfstaengl attended his 65th Harvard reunion, where he regaled the [[Harvard University Band]] about the authors of various Harvard fight songs. His relationship to Hitler went unmentioned.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nHanfstaengl died in Munich in 1975.

''See also'' Wikipedia article on [[Geli Raubal]]. While some historians have written that Hitler was nursed by Erna (and her mother) at Uffing following the Beer Hall putsch, Toland claims that this is a myth, resulting from the misinterpretation of the American journalists who interviewed the three Hanfstaengl women (the mother, sister and wife of Ernst) immediately after Hitler's arrest by the authorities. ''Toland'', p. 181 (footnote).</ref> two elder brothers Edgar and Egon, and a younger brother Erwine.<ref>''See A Sedgwick Genealogy: Descendants of Deacon Benjamin Sedgwick'' (p. 143) at sedgwick.org ([http://www.sedgwick.org/na/library/books/sed1961/sed1961-143.html Sedgwick Genealogy]). His elder brother Egon served in the German Army in World War I and was killed in 1915; his younger brother Erwine died of [[typhoid]] in the [[American Hospital of Paris|American Hospital]] in Paris in 1914.</ref>\n\nHe attended [[Harvard University]] and became acquainted with [[Walter Lippmann]] and [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]]. A gifted pianist, he composed several songs for Harvard's football team. He graduated in 1909.\n\nHe moved to New York City and took over the management of the American branch of his father's business, the Franz Hanfstaengl Fine Arts Publishing House. On frequent mornings he would practice on the piano at the [[Harvard Club of New York]], where he became acquainted with both [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Among his circle of acquaintances were the newspaper baron [[William Randolph Hearst]], author [[Djuna Barnes]] (to whom he was engaged), and actor [[Charlie Chaplin]].\n\nUpon the outbreak of war, he asked the German military attach\u00e9 in New York [[Franz von Papen]] to smuggle him back to Germany. Slightly baffled by the proposal, the attach\u00e9 refused and Hanfstaengl remained in the U.S. during the war. After 1917, the American branch of the family business was confiscated as enemy property.\n\nOn 11 February 1920, Hanfstaengl married Helene Elise Adelheid Niemeyer of [[Long Island]]. Their only son, [[Egon Hanfstaengl|Egon Ludwig]], eventually enlisted in the [[US Army Air Corps]]. A daughter, Hertha, died at the age of five.\n\n==Hitler's confidant==\n[[Image:Putzi Hanfstaengl and Diana Mitford in 1934.jpg|thumb|Hanfstaengl with [[Diana Mitford]] at a 1934 Nuremberg rally.]]\nReturning to Germany in 1922, he was living in his native Bavaria when he first heard Hitler speak in a Munich beer hall.<ref>The initial encounter was on 22 November 1922 at the Kindlkeller, a large L-shaped beer hall.

The Church has a legal position as a [[national church]] in the country, along with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]].With its roots in the medieval [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorodian]] missionary work in [[Karelia]], the Finnish Orthodox Church was a part of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] until 1923. Today the church has three dioceses and 60,000 members that account for 1.1 percent of the native population of [[Finland]]. The parish of [[Helsinki]] has the most adherents.\n\n== Catholic Church in Finland ==\n{{main|Catholic Church in Finland}}\n[[File:Saint_Henry's_Cathedral_Helsinki.jpg|thumb|St Henry's Cathedral, Catholic Diocese of Helsinki, Finland]]\nThe '''Catholic Church in Finland''' is part of the worldwide [[Catholic Church]], under the spiritual leadership of the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]]. As of 2019 there are more than 14,000 registered Catholics in [[Finland]] of total 5.5 million population of the whole country and also estimated about 10,000 unregistered Catholics in the country. There are estimated to be more than 6,000 Catholic families in the country, about half native Finns and the rest from international communities. \u00a0As of 2018 there are only five Finnish-born priests, and only three of them work in Finland. The [[Catholic Diocese of Helsinki|Bishop of Helsinki]] is Mgr. [[Teemu Sippo]], appointed on June 16, 2009. He is the first Finn to serve as a Catholic bishop for over 500 years. Currently there are more than 30 priests working in Finland from different countries. Due to the small number of Catholics in Finland, the whole country forms a single diocese, the [[Catholic Diocese of Helsinki]].The Catholic Church in Finland is active in [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] matters and is a member of the Finnish Ecumenical Council, even though the worldwide Catholic Church is not a member of the [[World Council of Churches]].\n\n== Finnish Neopaganism ==\n'''Finnish Neopaganism''', or the '''Finnish native faith''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''Suomenusko'': \"Finnish Faith\") is the contemporary [[Neopaganism|Neopagan revival]] of [[Finnish paganism]], the pre-Christian [[polytheistic]] [[ethnic religion]] of the [[Finns]]. A precursor movement was the ''Ukonusko'' (\"Ukko's Faith\", revolving around the god [[Ukko]]) of the early 20th century. The main problem in the revival of Finnish paganism is the nature of pre-Christian Finnish culture, which relied on oral tradition and of which very little is left. The primary sources concerning Finnish native culture are written by latter-era Christians. There are two main organisations of the religion, the \"Association of Finnish Native Religion\" (''Suomalaisen kansanuskon yhdistys ry'') based in [[Helsinki]] and officially registered since 2002, and the \"Pole Star Association\" (''Taivaannaula ry'') headquartered in [[Turku]] with branches in many cities, founded and officially registered in 2007. The Association of Finnish Native Religion also caters to [[Karelians]] and is a member of the [[Uralic Communion]].\n\n== Buddhism in Finland ==\n'''Buddhism in Finland''' represents a very small percentage of that nation's religious practices. In 2013 there were 5,266 followers of Buddhism in Finland, 0.1% of the population.<ref>https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/profiles/Finland/Religion/All-stats</ref> There are currently 12 Finnish cities that have Buddhist temples: in [[Helsinki]], [[Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4]], [[H\u00e4meenlinna]], [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]], [[Kouvola]], [[Kuopio]], [[Lahti]], [[Lappeenranta]], [[Pori]], [[Salo, Finland|Salo]], [[Tampere]] and [[Turku]].<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\n== Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Finland ==\nWhile no statistics on the numbers of Baha'is have been released, the Finland Census reports about 0.9 - 1.2% of the population as religious but non-Christian. The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] estimates the 2004 population of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds to be approximately 500. [[Operation World]], another Christian organization, estimated 0.01%, also about 500 Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, in 2003. In 2005 there was an estimate of 1668 according to the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]).\n\n== Hinduism in Finland ==\n'''Hinduism''' is a very minor [[Religion|religious]] faith in [[Finland]].  There are estimated to be around 5,000 Hindus in Finland, mostly from India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Finland acquired a significant [[Hindu]] population for the first time around the turn of the 21st century due to the recruitment of [[information technology]] workers from [[India]] by companies such as [[Nokia]].<ref>http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/i-fokus/in-focus-2010/theme-joint-nordic-drive-for-more-foreign-labour/finlands-welfare-system-appeals-to-indian-it-engineers|Nordic{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Labour Journal: Finland's welfare system appeals to Indian IT engineers</ref> In 2009, Hindu leaders in Finland protested the inclusion of a photograph that \"denigrates Hinduism\" in an exhibit at the [[Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art]].

The first [[Muslim|Muslims]] were [[Finnish Tatars|Tatars]] who immigrated mainly between 1870 and 1920. 2.7% of the population is Muslim. In December 2017 plans to build a large mosque complex in Helsinki financed by crowdfunding organized by the Islamic Foundation based in Bahrain were withdrawn after  the rejection by the city's Urban Environment Board for a bid for land. The application was rejected due to uncertainty over how reliable the funding would be for such a large project both for the initial building and running costs.  It was also criticized as it was unclear whether a single group within Islam would dominate its prayers and the attendant risk of [[radicalization]] and conflict between different religious communities.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McKernan |first1=Bethan |title=Finnish minister says new 'grand mosque' could pose 'security risk' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/finland-grand-mosque-helsinki-islam-extremism-islamophobia-tarja-mankkinen-pia-jardi-a7715761.html |accessdate=19 January 2019 |work=The Independent |date=3 May 2017 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=News Now Staff |title=Mirage: Why Helsinki's 'Grand Mosque' Disappeared |url=http://newsnowfinland.fi/finland-international/mirage-why-helsinkis-grand-mosque-disappeared |accessdate=19 January 2019 |work=News Now Finland |date=18 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Judaism in Finland ==\n'''Finnish Jews''' are [[Jew|Jews]] who are [[Citizen|citizens]] of [[Finland]]. The country is home to approximately 1,000 Jews in 2019,<ref name=statfin /> who mostly live in [[Helsinki]].Jews came to Finland as traders and merchants from other parts of Europe. During the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|Israeli War of Independence]] in 1948, about 28 Finnish Jews, mostly Finnish Army veterans, fought for the [[Israel|State of Israel]]. After Israel's establishment, Finland had a high rate of immigration to Israel (known as \"''[[aliyah]]''\"), which depleted Finland's Jewish community. The community was somewhat revitalized when some Soviet Jews immigrated to Finland following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The number of Jews in Finland in 2010 was approximately 1,500, of whom 1,200 lived in Helsinki, about 200 in [[Turku]], and about 50 in [[Tampere]]. The Jews are well integrated into Finnish society and are represented in nearly all sectors. Most Finnish Jews are corporate employees or self-employed professionals.Most Finnish Jews speak [[Finnish language|Finnish]] or [[Swedish language|Swedish]] as their [[mother tongue]]. [[Yiddish]], [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Hebrew]] are also spoken in the community. The Jews, like Finland's other traditional minorities as well as immigrant groups, are represented on the Advisory Board for Ethnic Relations ([[ETNO]]).There are two synagogues: [[Helsinki Synagogue|one in Helsinki]] and [[Turku Synagogue|one in Turku]]. Helsinki also has a [[Jewish day school]], which serves about 110 students (many of them the children of [[Israel|Israelis]] working in Finland); and a [[Chabad Lubavitch]] rabbi is based there.Tampere previously had an organized Jewish community, but it stopped functioning in 1981. The other two cities continue to run their community organizations.\n\n== Population register ==\nTraditionally, the church has played a very important role in maintaining a population register in Finland. The vicars have maintained a church record of persons born, married and deceased in their parishes since at least the 1660s, constituting one of the oldest population records in Europe. This system was in place for over 300 years. It was only replaced by a computerised central population database in 1971, while the two state churches continued to maintain population registers in co-operation with the government's local register offices until 1999, when the churches' task was limited to only maintaining a membership register.<ref name=vrk-history>{{cite web|url=http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=42|title=History|work=VRK.fi|publisher=[[Population Register Centre (Finland)|Population Register Centre]]|accessdate=18 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703082853/http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=42|archivedate=3 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1919 and 1970, a separate Civil Register was maintained of those who had no affiliation with either of the state churches.<ref name=vrk-history /> Currently, the centralised Population Information System records the person's affiliation with a legally recognised religious community, if any.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=176|title=Rekisteriselosteet|work=VRK.fi|publisher=V\u00e4est\u00f6rekisterikeskus|language=Finnish|accessdate=18 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513124630/http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=176|archivedate=13 May 2013}}</ref> In 2003, the new Freedom of Religion Act made it possible to resign from religious communities in writing.

The Church has a legal position as a [[national church]] in the country, along with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]].With its roots in the medieval [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorodian]] missionary work in [[Karelia]], the Finnish Orthodox Church was a part of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] until 1923. Today the church has three dioceses and 60,000 members that account for 1.1 percent of the native population of [[Finland]]. The parish of [[Helsinki]] has the most adherents.\n\n== Catholic Church in Finland ==\n{{main|Catholic Church in Finland}}\n[[File:Saint_Henry's_Cathedral_Helsinki.jpg|thumb|St Henry's Cathedral, Catholic Diocese of Helsinki, Finland]]\nThe '''Catholic Church in Finland''' is part of the worldwide [[Catholic Church]], under the spiritual leadership of the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]]. As of 2019 there are more than 14,000 registered Catholics in [[Finland]] of total 5.5 million population of the whole country and also estimated about 10,000 unregistered Catholics in the country. There are estimated to be more than 6,000 Catholic families in the country, about half native Finns and the rest from international communities. \u00a0As of 2018 there are only five Finnish-born priests, and only three of them work in Finland. The [[Catholic Diocese of Helsinki|Bishop of Helsinki]] is Mgr. [[Teemu Sippo]], appointed on June 16, 2009. He is the first Finn to serve as a Catholic bishop for over 500 years. Currently there are more than 30 priests working in Finland from different countries. Due to the small number of Catholics in Finland, the whole country forms a single diocese, the [[Catholic Diocese of Helsinki]].The Catholic Church in Finland is active in [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] matters and is a member of the Finnish Ecumenical Council, even though the worldwide Catholic Church is not a member of the [[World Council of Churches]].\n\n== Finnish Neopaganism ==\n'''Finnish Neopaganism''', or the '''Finnish native faith''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''Suomenusko'': \"Finnish Faith\") is the contemporary [[Neopaganism|Neopagan revival]] of [[Finnish paganism]], the pre-Christian [[polytheistic]] [[ethnic religion]] of the [[Finns]]. A precursor movement was the ''Ukonusko'' (\"Ukko's Faith\", revolving around the god [[Ukko]]) of the early 20th century. The main problem in the revival of Finnish paganism is the nature of pre-Christian Finnish culture, which relied on oral tradition and of which very little is left. The primary sources concerning Finnish native culture are written by latter-era Christians. There are two main organisations of the religion, the \"Association of Finnish Native Religion\" (''Suomalaisen kansanuskon yhdistys ry'') based in [[Helsinki]] and officially registered since 2002, and the \"Pole Star Association\" (''Taivaannaula ry'') headquartered in [[Turku]] with branches in many cities, founded and officially registered in 2007. The Association of Finnish Native Religion also caters to [[Karelians]] and is a member of the [[Uralic Communion]].\n\n== Buddhism in Finland ==\n'''Buddhism in Finland''' represents a very small percentage of that nation's religious practices. In 2013 there were 5,266 followers of Buddhism in Finland, 0.1% of the population.<ref>https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/profiles/Finland/Religion/All-stats</ref> There are currently 12 Finnish cities that have Buddhist temples: in [[Helsinki]], [[Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4]], [[H\u00e4meenlinna]], [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]], [[Kouvola]], [[Kuopio]], [[Lahti]], [[Lappeenranta]], [[Pori]], [[Salo, Finland|Salo]], [[Tampere]] and [[Turku]].<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\n== Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Finland ==\nWhile no statistics on the numbers of Baha'is have been released, the Finland Census reports about 0.9 - 1.2% of the population as religious but non-Christian. The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] estimates the 2004 population of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds to be approximately 500. [[Operation World]], another Christian organization, estimated 0.01%, also about 500 Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, in 2003. In 2005 there was an estimate of 1668 according to the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]).\n\n== Hinduism in Finland ==\n'''Hinduism''' is a very minor [[Religion|religious]] faith in [[Finland]].  There are estimated to be around 5,000 Hindus in Finland, mostly from India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Finland acquired a significant [[Hindu]] population for the first time around the turn of the 21st century due to the recruitment of [[information technology]] workers from [[India]] by companies such as [[Nokia]].<ref>http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/i-fokus/in-focus-2010/theme-joint-nordic-drive-for-more-foreign-labour/finlands-welfare-system-appeals-to-indian-it-engineers|Nordic{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Labour Journal: Finland's welfare system appeals to Indian IT engineers</ref> In 2009, Hindu leaders in Finland protested the inclusion of a photograph that \"denigrates Hinduism\" in an exhibit at the [[Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art]].

The first [[Muslim|Muslims]] were [[Finnish Tatars|Tatars]] who immigrated mainly between 1870 and 1920. 2.7% of the population is Muslim. In December 2017 plans to build a large mosque complex in Helsinki financed by crowdfunding organized by the Islamic Foundation based in Bahrain were withdrawn after  the rejection by the city's Urban Environment Board for a bid for land. The application was rejected due to uncertainty over how reliable the funding would be for such a large project both for the initial building and running costs.  It was also criticized as it was unclear whether a single group within Islam would dominate its prayers and the attendant risk of [[radicalization]] and conflict between different religious communities.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McKernan |first1=Bethan |title=Finnish minister says new 'grand mosque' could pose 'security risk' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/finland-grand-mosque-helsinki-islam-extremism-islamophobia-tarja-mankkinen-pia-jardi-a7715761.html |accessdate=19 January 2019 |work=The Independent |date=3 May 2017 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=News Now Staff |title=Mirage: Why Helsinki's 'Grand Mosque' Disappeared |url=http://newsnowfinland.fi/finland-international/mirage-why-helsinkis-grand-mosque-disappeared |accessdate=19 January 2019 |work=News Now Finland |date=18 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Judaism in Finland ==\n'''Finnish Jews''' are [[Jew|Jews]] who are [[Citizen|citizens]] of [[Finland]]. The country is home to approximately 1,000 Jews in 2019,<ref name=statfin /> who mostly live in [[Helsinki]].Jews came to Finland as traders and merchants from other parts of Europe. During the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|Israeli War of Independence]] in 1948, about 28 Finnish Jews, mostly Finnish Army veterans, fought for the [[Israel|State of Israel]]. After Israel's establishment, Finland had a high rate of immigration to Israel (known as \"''[[aliyah]]''\"), which depleted Finland's Jewish community. The community was somewhat revitalized when some Soviet Jews immigrated to Finland following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The number of Jews in Finland in 2010 was approximately 1,500, of whom 1,200 lived in Helsinki, about 200 in [[Turku]], and about 50 in [[Tampere]]. The Jews are well integrated into Finnish society and are represented in nearly all sectors. Most Finnish Jews are corporate employees or self-employed professionals.Most Finnish Jews speak [[Finnish language|Finnish]] or [[Swedish language|Swedish]] as their [[mother tongue]]. [[Yiddish]], [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Hebrew]] are also spoken in the community. The Jews, like Finland's other traditional minorities as well as immigrant groups, are represented on the Advisory Board for Ethnic Relations ([[ETNO]]).There are two synagogues: [[Helsinki Synagogue|one in Helsinki]] and [[Turku Synagogue|one in Turku]]. Helsinki also has a [[Jewish day school]], which serves about 110 students (many of them the children of [[Israel|Israelis]] working in Finland); and a [[Chabad Lubavitch]] rabbi is based there.Tampere previously had an organized Jewish community, but it stopped functioning in 1981. The other two cities continue to run their community organizations.\n\n== Population register ==\nTraditionally, the church has played a very important role in maintaining a population register in Finland. The vicars have maintained a church record of persons born, married and deceased in their parishes since at least the 1660s, constituting one of the oldest population records in Europe. This system was in place for over 300 years. It was only replaced by a computerised central population database in 1971, while the two state churches continued to maintain population registers in co-operation with the government's local register offices until 1999, when the churches' task was limited to only maintaining a membership register.<ref name=vrk-history>{{cite web|url=http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=42|title=History|work=VRK.fi|publisher=[[Population Register Centre (Finland)|Population Register Centre]]|accessdate=18 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703082853/http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=42|archivedate=3 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1919 and 1970, a separate Civil Register was maintained of those who had no affiliation with either of the state churches.<ref name=vrk-history /> Currently, the centralised Population Information System records the person's affiliation with a legally recognised religious community, if any.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=176|title=Rekisteriselosteet|work=VRK.fi|publisher=V\u00e4est\u00f6rekisterikeskus|language=Finnish|accessdate=18 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513124630/http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=176|archivedate=13 May 2013}}</ref> In 2003, the new Freedom of Religion Act made it possible to resign from religious communities in writing.

George Talbot was appointed Surveyor-General of Maryland in 1683. In the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, James Talbot's estate in Ballyconnell was confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687. The Talbot lands in Killycluggin were distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as belonging to ''Captain Gwilliams'' (i.e. the landlord of Ballyconnell, Captain Thomas Gwyllym) and the tenants as ''Edward Rely & Others''. \n\nIn the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663<ref>''The Hearth Money Rolls for the Baronies of Tullyhunco and Tullyhaw, County Cavan'', edited by Rev.

He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at Lissanover, County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin (probably [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)]]),  despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of Killeclogine alias Killecragan. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727.

At that time the stone was in the same broken state in which it now appears and was situated some 10m SE of a stone circle (CV013-026002-). Macalister recorded local traditions which alleged that the damage to the stone had been carried out in living memory by local farmers in order to remove an obstruction to agricultural activities. Macalister also stated that people of the vicinity had dug around the stone in a vain search for buried treasure and in so doing had apparently destroyed a 'cist burial'. He did not, however, actually see this 'cist burial'. Some thirty years later a second decorated stone fragment, probably a portion of the same monolith, was discovered a short distance down-slope from the main piece. In the early summer of 1974 it was decided to remove the weathered and overgrown fragments to the National Museum of Ireland. A limited excavation was undertaken in its immediate vicinity which revealed that 'the stone stood in a flat-bottomed pit which had been deliberately sunk 80cm into the subsoil to receive it' (Raftery 1978, 51-2). Immediately E of the stone were two pits one of which may be identified as the remains of the cist burial identified by Macalister as it contained tiny fragments of burnt bone (CV013-026003-). The two fragments of the Killycluggin Stone are on display in the Cavan County Museum, Ballyjamesduff, while a replica stands at the cross-roads c. 250m NW of the original site. The following description of the stone is derived from Raftery (1978, 49-51). The main fragment has been worked to more-or-less cylindrical form on its surviving upper portion. That part which was intended to be below ground level is rough and irregular and projects awkwardly in one direction so that the stone as a whole is crudely L-shaped. The base of the stone slopes obliquely to its vertical axis. The entire upper surface of this stone had been smashed by deliberate and systematic hammering. This destruction continued along one side, whereby the ornament, down to the base of the stone was totally obliterated. The surviving ornament, which comprises combinations of sweeping curves and tight, hair-spring spirals \u2013 classic La T\u00e8ne motifs \u2013 is chiseled deeply and crisply into the prepared surface of the stone. The curvilinear patterns have been divided into rectangular panels by straight vertical lines and by horizontal lines at right angles to them which define the basal extremity of the ornamented area. The precise original width of only one such panel can now be ascertained (c. 0.9m wide and 0.75m high) but it may be estimated that four such panels of decoration once existed on the stone giving an original circumference of 3.6m. The smaller decorated fragment appears to represent a portion of the dome-shaped top of the original monolith and, in this regard, would have resembled that of the best known of the Irish aniconic stones, the stele from Turoe, Co. Galway (GA097-152----). The decoration on this fragment is of two types. Along one edge slight remains of curvilinear patterns, similar to those on the portion just described, survive. Sufficient remains to show that the upper limits of this decoration are defined by a straight line as is the case at the base of the stone, and traces of one of the lines which divide the ornament into vertical, rectangular panels are present here too. The convex upper surface of this fragment is decorated by a series of deeply chiseled, parallel lines which extend across the surface of the stone. The surviving edges of this panel of ornament are defined by a straight line which is incised at an oblique angle to the line which forms the boundary to the zones of curvilinear ornament. Thus there occurs what is now a triangular area, devoid of ornament between the ornament on the apex of the stone and the ornament on the surviving cylindrical part. The two decorated fragments do not join so that neither the original height of the stone nor the precise overall disposition of its ornamentation can now be ascertained. (O\u2019Donovan 1995, no. 93 with further references) The Killycluggin Ornamented stones are subject to a preservation order made under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2014 (PO no. 17/1933).

George Talbot was appointed Surveyor-General of Maryland in 1683. In the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, James Talbot's estate in Ballyconnell was confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687. The Talbot lands in Killycluggin were distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as belonging to ''Captain Gwilliams'' (i.e. the landlord of Ballyconnell, Captain Thomas Gwyllym) and the tenants as ''Edward Rely & Others''. \n\nIn the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663<ref>''The Hearth Money Rolls for the Baronies of Tullyhunco and Tullyhaw, County Cavan'', edited by Rev.

He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at Lissanover, County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin (probably [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)]]),  despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of Killeclogine alias Killecragan. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727. The Blachford family gravestones in Templeport Church read as follows- This monument was erected by MAJOR WILLIAM / BLASHFORD of Lisnover in 1721 to the memory of / his father, JOHN BLASHFORD, late of the same Esqr. but / from Dorchester in Dorsetshire, the place of his / nativity, who in his lifetime chose this for a burying / place, for himself and family, but died in Dublin / was buried in St. Orvins Church but his wife, MARY / RENALD of a Devonsheire family is buried here / as also three sons and two daughters, viz JOHN / AMBROSE AND THOMAS; MARY AND FRANCES / Here likewise lies buried two wives of MAJOR WILLIAM BLASHFORD, son to the said JOHN BLASHFORD viz / MARY MAGHEE of an ancient Family in Lincolnsheire.

At that time the stone was in the same broken state in which it now appears and was situated some 10m SE of a stone circle (CV013-026002-). Macalister recorded local traditions which alleged that the damage to the stone had been carried out in living memory by local farmers in order to remove an obstruction to agricultural activities. Macalister also stated that people of the vicinity had dug around the stone in a vain search for buried treasure and in so doing had apparently destroyed a 'cist burial'. He did not, however, actually see this 'cist burial'. Some thirty years later a second decorated stone fragment, probably a portion of the same monolith, was discovered a short distance down-slope from the main piece. In the early summer of 1974 it was decided to remove the weathered and overgrown fragments to the National Museum of Ireland. A limited excavation was undertaken in its immediate vicinity which revealed that 'the stone stood in a flat-bottomed pit which had been deliberately sunk 80cm into the subsoil to receive it' (Raftery 1978, 51-2). Immediately E of the stone were two pits one of which may be identified as the remains of the cist burial identified by Macalister as it contained tiny fragments of burnt bone (CV013-026003-). The two fragments of the Killycluggin Stone are on display in the Cavan County Museum, Ballyjamesduff, while a replica stands at the cross-roads c. 250m NW of the original site. The following description of the stone is derived from Raftery (1978, 49-51). The main fragment has been worked to more-or-less cylindrical form on its surviving upper portion. That part which was intended to be below ground level is rough and irregular and projects awkwardly in one direction so that the stone as a whole is crudely L-shaped. The base of the stone slopes obliquely to its vertical axis. The entire upper surface of this stone had been smashed by deliberate and systematic hammering. This destruction continued along one side, whereby the ornament, down to the base of the stone was totally obliterated. The surviving ornament, which comprises combinations of sweeping curves and tight, hair-spring spirals \u2013 classic La T\u00e8ne motifs \u2013 is chiseled deeply and crisply into the prepared surface of the stone. The curvilinear patterns have been divided into rectangular panels by straight vertical lines and by horizontal lines at right angles to them which define the basal extremity of the ornamented area. The precise original width of only one such panel can now be ascertained (c. 0.9m wide and 0.75m high) but it may be estimated that four such panels of decoration once existed on the stone giving an original circumference of 3.6m. The smaller decorated fragment appears to represent a portion of the dome-shaped top of the original monolith and, in this regard, would have resembled that of the best known of the Irish aniconic stones, the stele from Turoe, Co. Galway (GA097-152----). The decoration on this fragment is of two types. Along one edge slight remains of curvilinear patterns, similar to those on the portion just described, survive. Sufficient remains to show that the upper limits of this decoration are defined by a straight line as is the case at the base of the stone, and traces of one of the lines which divide the ornament into vertical, rectangular panels are present here too. The convex upper surface of this fragment is decorated by a series of deeply chiseled, parallel lines which extend across the surface of the stone. The surviving edges of this panel of ornament are defined by a straight line which is incised at an oblique angle to the line which forms the boundary to the zones of curvilinear ornament. Thus there occurs what is now a triangular area, devoid of ornament between the ornament on the apex of the stone and the ornament on the surviving cylindrical part. The two decorated fragments do not join so that neither the original height of the stone nor the precise overall disposition of its ornamentation can now be ascertained. (O\u2019Donovan 1995, no. 93 with further references) The Killycluggin Ornamented stones are subject to a preservation order made under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2014 (PO no. 17/1933).
