He served as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Archbishop of Cincinnati]] from 1972 until 1982, and as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Archbishop of Chicago]] from 1982 until his death in 1996 from [[pancreatic cancer]]. Bernardin was elevated to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]] in 1983 by [[Pope John Paul II]].\n\n== Biography ==\nJoseph Bernardin was born on April 2, 1928, in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], to Joseph and Maria Simion Bernardin, an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Immigration|immigrant]] couple.<ref name=unsworth/> He was baptized and confirmed at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Columbia. His father died of cancer when Bernardin was six. He took responsibility for his younger sister, Elaine, while his widowed mother worked as a [[seamstress]].\n\nBernardin's original academic ambition was to become a [[physician]], inspiring him to enroll in the pre-medical program at the [[University of South Carolina]].<ref name=unsworth/>  He then transferred to [[Saint Mary Seminary]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Philosophy]] in 1948, and subsequently enrolled in [[The Catholic University of America]] to complete his theological studies.\n\nOn April 26, 1952, Bernardin was ordained a priest of the [[Diocese of Charleston]] by [[John Joyce Russell|John J. Russell]] at St. Joseph Church. This diocese covers the entire state of [[South Carolina]]. During his 14-year tenure at the [[Diocese of Charleston]], Father Bernardin served under four bishops in capacities including [[chancellor]], [[vicar general]], diocesan counselor, and, when the [[Episcopal see|See]] was vacant, diocesan administrator. In 1959, [[Pope John XXIII]] named Bernardin a [[Papal Chamberlain]] with the title Very Reverend Monsignor.\n\n=== Auxiliary Bishop of Atlanta ===\nOn March 9, 1966 Pope [[Paul VI]] appointed [[Monsignor]] Bernardin titular Bishop of Liguria and [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of the [[Archdiocese of Atlanta]]. His episcopal consecration took place on April 26, 1966 at the hands of his mentor, the [[Archbishop]] of Atlanta, [[Paul John Hallinan|Paul Hallinan]]. Bernardin, only 38 years old, thus became the youngest bishop in America. From 1966 to 1968, Bishop Bernardin served as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the [[Cathedral of Christ the King (Atlanta, Georgia)|Cathedral of Christ the King]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\nAccording to Monsignor Kenneth Velo, a former executive aide to Bernandin and head of the Catholic Church Extension Society, it was in the predominantly Baptist American South that Bernardin learned [[ecumenism]].<ref name=\"peace\">{{Cite web|url=https://info.franciscanmedia.org/|title=Franciscan Media|first=Franciscan|last=Media|website=info.franciscanmedia.org}}</ref>\n\n=== General Secretary of National Conference ===\nIn 1968, he resigned as auxiliary bishop of Atlanta to become the first General Secretary of the [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]], a post he held until 1972. In 1969 Bishop Bernadin was instrumental in founding one of the conference's most influential and successful programs, the anti-poverty [[Catholic Campaign for Human Development|Campaign for Human Development.]]<ref name=peace/>\n\n=== Archbishop of Cincinnati ===\n[[Pope Paul VI]] appointed Bernardin [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Archbishop of Cincinnati]] on November 21, 1972, and he was installed there December 19, 1972. Bernardin served the [[Metropolitan See]] of Cincinnati for nearly ten years. While there he appointed the first woman editor of the archdiocesan newspaper, ''[[The Catholic Telegraph]]''.\n\nWhile Archbishop of Cincinnati, Bernardin was named to the [[Congregation for Bishops|Sacred Congregation of Bishops]], elected to the permanent council of the [[Synod of Bishops (Catholic)|Synod of Bishops]], and was elected president of the [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]].<ref name=peace/> He worked to improve relations between Catholics and [[Jews]], strove for better understanding between the Catholic Church and [[Protestant]] denominations, and made pastoral visits to both [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]].\n\n=== Archbishop of Chicago ===\nFollowing the death of Cardinal [[John Cody]] of [[Chicago]], [[Pope John Paul II]] chose Archbishop Bernardin, already prominent among his fellow American bishops, to lead the [[Archdiocese of Chicago]].  He was appointed the twelfth Bishop and seventh Archbishop of Chicago on July 10, 1982. On August 25, 1982, he was formally installed in that role by the [[Apostolic Delegate]], [[Pio Laghi]]. Bernardin found an archdiocese in disarray, its priests disheartened by years of arbitrary administration and charges of financial misconduct. \"With his patient charm and willingness to listen, Bernardin won back the confidence of the clergy and the laity....\"<ref name=nytm>[[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/01/magazine/death-as-a-friend.html?pagewanted=all Death as a Friend] \"Death as a Friend\", ''The New York Times Magazine\", December 1, 1996]</ref>\n\n=== Elevation to Cardinal ===\nIn the [[Papal consistory|Consistory]] of February 2, 1983, he was elevated to the Sacred College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''Ges\u00f9 Divino Lavoratore'' ([[Jesus the Divine Worker]]) as his [[titular church]].\n\n=== Honorary degrees and awards ===\nIn 1989, Bernardin was awarded the F.

He removed more than a score of priests and established a new review board, made up primarily of lay people.<ref name=nytm/> Bernardin's reforms concerning this issue soon served as a model for other dioceses across the nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.archchicago.org/jcbbio.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024013546/http://archives.archchicago.org/jcbbio.htm|url-status=dead|title=Biography of Joseph Cardinal Bernardin|archivedate=October 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\nBernardin himself said in a press conference that he had been accused of sexual misconduct. Former seminarian Stephen Cook claimed to have been abused by Bernardin and another priest in the 1970s. However, Cook subsequently dropped Bernardin from his lawsuit, being no longer certain that his memories, which had emerged while he was under hypnosis, were accurate. The two later reconciled. Cook later said that he had relied on people who told him things that were not true, \"asserting that he is absolutely convinced of Bernardin's innocence\".<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-01-05/news/9501050333_1_cardinal-bernardin-steven-cook-rev-ellis-harsham Galloway, Paul. \"Bernardin, Ex-accuser Reconcile\"], ''Chicago Tribune'', January. 5, 1995</ref>\n\n=== Final illness ===\n[[Image:BishopsMausoleumAug2004.jpg|thumbnail|right|260px|Cardinal Bernardin's Final Resting Place]]\nIn June 1995, following a string of international visits and pilgrimages, Bernardin underwent surgery for [[pancreatic cancer]]. On August 30, 1996, Bernardin told his flock that the cancer had returned, was in his liver, and was inoperable. He turned over the day-to-day administration of the Archdiocese to his vicar general and auxiliary bishop, Most Rev. Raymond Goedert. Bernardin then began to focus much of his ministry on the sick, and became the \"unofficial chaplain\" to Chicago cancer patients.<ref name=Feister>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Feb1997/feature2.asp Feister, John Bookser. \"Cardinal Joseph L. Bernadin\", ''St. Anthony Messenger'']</ref>\n\nOn September 23, Bernardin traveled to [[Rome]] to visit with [[Pope John Paul II]] and visit [[Assisi]]. It was on that trip that Bernardin made his funerary arrangements. Upon his return to Chicago, he arranged for the care for his mother, whom he visited daily at her nursing home,<ref name=Feister/> and the distribution of his personal possessions. Bernardin arranged for his personal papers and administrative files to be transported from the Residence and Pastoral Center to the Archdiocese of Chicago's Archives and Records Center.\n\nTwo weeks before his death, he completed his best-selling book about the end of life and about his own approaching death in particular, called ''The Gift Of Peace'', with the help of his friend and biographer [[Eugene Kennedy]].<ref name=\"peace\"/>\n\nIn his final weeks, he was also awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President Bill Clinton. He gave a major \"Seamless Garment of Life\" address at Georgetown University, where he received an award from and conversed with Father [[Leo J. O'Donovan]], S.J., then Georgetown's president.\n\nHe said goodbye to 800 of the diocesan and religious clergy of the Archdiocese at Holy Name Cathedral weeks before his death. On October 7, Bernardin met with the Presbyterate, and by the end of October, he withdrew from his active ministry due to his deteriorating strength. In his last days, Bernardin wrote to the [[United States Supreme Court]] against [[assisted suicide]].\n\nOn November 14, 1996, Bernardin died from [[pancreatic cancer]] at the age of 68.\n\nThe funeral [[homily]] was given by his friend Reverend Monsignor Kenneth Velo. In the weeks before his death, Bernardin emphasized to the faithful and the public that he was at peace because of his life's profound reliance on God's sustaining grace in his ministry and his struggles with cancer, seeing death as \"a continuation and a friend to prepare properly for by conducting ourselves well and letting go to abandon one's self to God in the end\". He was interred in the Bishops' Mausoleum at [[Mount Carmel Cemetery (Hillside)|Mt. Carmel Cemetery]], [[Hillside, Illinois]], following a [[Funeral Mass]] celebrated by his good friend, Cardinal [[Roger Mahony]], and a wake for priests at which his good friend Father Scott Donahue spoke.\n\n== Views ==\n=== Seamless garment of life ===\nIn 1983 Bernardin developed the \"[[Consistent Life Ethic|Consistent Ethic of Life]]\" (or CLE) ideology, which expressed his response to living in an age in which he believed modern technologies threatened the sanctity of human life. Bernardin's CLE philosophy is sometimes called the \"[[seamless garment]]\", a reference from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&chapter=19&verse=22&end_verse=24&version=49&context=context John 19:23] to the [[seamless robe of Jesus]]. The seamless garment philosophy holds that issues such as abortion, capital punishment, militarism, euthanasia, social injustice, and economic injustice all demand a consistent application of moral principles that value the sacredness of human life (as defined by the Catholic Church). In response to critiques from some [[anti-abortion]] activists, Bernardin said that the ethic did not describe all threats to life as equal but that all were related: \"A systemic vision of life seeks to expand the moral imagination of a society, not partition it into airtight categories. ... A consistent ethic of life seeks to present a coherent linkage among a diverse set of issues. It can and should be used to test party platforms, public policies, and political candidates.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bernardinwade.html|title=A Consistent Ethic of Life: Continuing the Dialogue|website=www.priestsforlife.org|access-date=May 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Other social issues ===\n\nIn 1981, Bernardin became head of the new [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops|NCCB]] Ad Hoc Committee on War and Peace, formed to draft a pastoral letter on nuclear proliferation.<ref name=\"McBrady 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=McBrady |first1=Jared |title=The Challenge of Peace: Ronald Reagan, John Paul II, and the American Bishops |journal=Journal of Cold War Studies |date=January 2015 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=129\u2013152 |doi=10.1162/JCWS_a_00533 |url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/JCWS_a_00533 |language=en |issn=1520-3972}}</ref> The resulting book-length letter, \"[[The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response]]\", was published in 1983.<ref name=\"McBrady 2015\"/> An influential statement of [[Catholic social teaching]], the document condemns nuclear warfare<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hansen |first1=Luke |title='The Challenge of Peace' Today |url=https://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/challenge-peace-today |accessdate=17 March 2020 |work=America Magazine |date=3 May 2013 |language=en}}</ref> and states that [[nuclear deterrence]] is \"not an adequate strategy as a long-term basis for peace; it is a transitional strategy justifiable only in conjunction with resolute determination to pursue arms control and disarmament\".<ref>{{cite document |url=http://www.usccb.org/upload/challenge-peace-gods-promise-our-response-1983.pdf|title=The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response|publisher=USCCB}}</ref> In relation to his work on the nuclear question, Bernardin was featured on the front cover of a 1982 issue of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' entitled \"God and the Bomb\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last1=Smith |editor-first1=Frank J. |work=Religion and Politics in America: An Encyclopedia of Church and State in American Life |date=2016 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-436-8 |title=Bernardin, Cardinal Joseph Louis (1928\u20131996)|last=Ortiz|first=Fernando A.|pages=55\u201356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWxyDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA56 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Ostling |first1=Richard N. |title=Bishops and the Bomb |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955097,00.html |work=Time |date=29 November 1982}}</ref>\n\nBernardin became a mediator between the diverging parties in the changing Post-Conciliar Church.

He served as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Archbishop of Cincinnati]] from 1972 until 1982, and as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Archbishop of Chicago]] from 1982 until his death in 1996 from [[pancreatic cancer]]. Bernardin was elevated to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]] in 1983 by [[Pope John Paul II]].\n\n== Biography ==\nJoseph Bernardin was born on April 2, 1928, in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], to Joseph and Maria Simion Bernardin, an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Immigration|immigrant]] couple.<ref name=unsworth/> He was baptized and confirmed at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Columbia. His father died of cancer when Bernardin was six. He took responsibility for his younger sister, Elaine, while his widowed mother worked as a [[seamstress]].\n\nBernardin's original academic ambition was to become a [[physician]], inspiring him to enroll in the pre-medical program at the [[University of South Carolina]].<ref name=unsworth/>  He then transferred to [[Saint Mary Seminary]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Philosophy]] in 1948, and subsequently enrolled in [[The Catholic University of America]] to complete his theological studies.\n\nOn April 26, 1952, Bernardin was ordained a priest of the [[Diocese of Charleston]] by [[John Joyce Russell|John J. Russell]] at St. Joseph Church. This diocese covers the entire state of [[South Carolina]]. During his 14-year tenure at the [[Diocese of Charleston]], Father Bernardin served under four bishops in capacities including [[chancellor]], [[vicar general]], diocesan counselor, and, when the [[Episcopal see|See]] was vacant, diocesan administrator. In 1959, [[Pope John XXIII]] named Bernardin a [[Papal Chamberlain]] with the title Very Reverend Monsignor.\n\n=== Auxiliary Bishop of Atlanta ===\nOn March 9, 1966 Pope [[Paul VI]] appointed [[Monsignor]] Bernardin titular Bishop of Liguria and [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of the [[Archdiocese of Atlanta]]. His episcopal consecration took place on April 26, 1966 at the hands of his mentor, the [[Archbishop]] of Atlanta, [[Paul John Hallinan|Paul Hallinan]]. Bernardin, only 38 years old, thus became the youngest bishop in America. From 1966 to 1968, Bishop Bernardin served as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the [[Cathedral of Christ the King (Atlanta, Georgia)|Cathedral of Christ the King]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\nAccording to Monsignor Kenneth Velo, a former executive aide to Bernandin and head of the Catholic Church Extension Society, it was in the predominantly Baptist American South that Bernardin learned [[ecumenism]].<ref name=\"peace\">{{Cite web|url=https://info.franciscanmedia.org/|title=Franciscan Media|first=Franciscan|last=Media|website=info.franciscanmedia.org}}</ref>\n\n=== General Secretary of National Conference ===\nIn 1968, he resigned as auxiliary bishop of Atlanta to become the first General Secretary of the [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]], a post he held until 1972. In 1969 Bishop Bernadin was instrumental in founding one of the conference's most influential and successful programs, the anti-poverty [[Catholic Campaign for Human Development|Campaign for Human Development.]]<ref name=peace/>\n\n=== Archbishop of Cincinnati ===\n[[Pope Paul VI]] appointed Bernardin [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Archbishop of Cincinnati]] on November 21, 1972, and he was installed there December 19, 1972. Bernardin served the [[Metropolitan See]] of Cincinnati for nearly ten years. While there he appointed the first woman editor of the archdiocesan newspaper, ''[[The Catholic Telegraph]]''.\n\nWhile Archbishop of Cincinnati, Bernardin was named to the [[Congregation for Bishops|Sacred Congregation of Bishops]], elected to the permanent council of the [[Synod of Bishops (Catholic)|Synod of Bishops]], and was elected president of the [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]].<ref name=peace/> He worked to improve relations between Catholics and [[Jews]], strove for better understanding between the Catholic Church and [[Protestant]] denominations, and made pastoral visits to both [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]].\n\n=== Archbishop of Chicago ===\nFollowing the death of Cardinal [[John Cody]] of [[Chicago]], [[Pope John Paul II]] chose Archbishop Bernardin, already prominent among his fellow American bishops, to lead the [[Archdiocese of Chicago]].  He was appointed the twelfth Bishop and seventh Archbishop of Chicago on July 10, 1982. On August 25, 1982, he was formally installed in that role by the [[Apostolic Delegate]], [[Pio Laghi]]. Bernardin found an archdiocese in disarray, its priests disheartened by years of arbitrary administration and charges of financial misconduct. \"With his patient charm and willingness to listen, Bernardin won back the confidence of the clergy and the laity....\"<ref name=nytm>[[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/01/magazine/death-as-a-friend.html?pagewanted=all Death as a Friend] \"Death as a Friend\", ''The New York Times Magazine\", December 1, 1996]</ref>\n\n=== Elevation to Cardinal ===\nIn the [[Papal consistory|Consistory]] of February 2, 1983, he was elevated to the Sacred College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''Ges\u00f9 Divino Lavoratore'' ([[Jesus the Divine Worker]]) as his [[titular church]].\n\n=== Honorary degrees and awards ===\nIn 1989, Bernardin was awarded the F. Sadlier Dinger Award by educational publisher [[William H. Sadlier, Inc.]] The award is presented annually in recognition of an outstanding contribution to the ministry of religious education in America.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sadlier Religion {{!}} The F.

He removed more than a score of priests and established a new review board, made up primarily of lay people.<ref name=nytm/> Bernardin's reforms concerning this issue soon served as a model for other dioceses across the nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.archchicago.org/jcbbio.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024013546/http://archives.archchicago.org/jcbbio.htm|url-status=dead|title=Biography of Joseph Cardinal Bernardin|archivedate=October 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\nBernardin himself said in a press conference that he had been accused of sexual misconduct. Former seminarian Stephen Cook claimed to have been abused by Bernardin and another priest in the 1970s. However, Cook subsequently dropped Bernardin from his lawsuit, being no longer certain that his memories, which had emerged while he was under hypnosis, were accurate. The two later reconciled. Cook later said that he had relied on people who told him things that were not true, \"asserting that he is absolutely convinced of Bernardin's innocence\".<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-01-05/news/9501050333_1_cardinal-bernardin-steven-cook-rev-ellis-harsham Galloway, Paul. \"Bernardin, Ex-accuser Reconcile\"], ''Chicago Tribune'', January. 5, 1995</ref>\n\n=== Final illness ===\n[[Image:BishopsMausoleumAug2004.jpg|thumbnail|right|260px|Cardinal Bernardin's Final Resting Place]]\nIn June 1995, following a string of international visits and pilgrimages, Bernardin underwent surgery for [[pancreatic cancer]]. On August 30, 1996, Bernardin told his flock that the cancer had returned, was in his liver, and was inoperable. He turned over the day-to-day administration of the Archdiocese to his vicar general and auxiliary bishop, Most Rev. Raymond Goedert. Bernardin then began to focus much of his ministry on the sick, and became the \"unofficial chaplain\" to Chicago cancer patients.<ref name=Feister>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Feb1997/feature2.asp Feister, John Bookser. \"Cardinal Joseph L. Bernadin\", ''St. Anthony Messenger'']</ref>\n\nOn September 23, Bernardin traveled to [[Rome]] to visit with [[Pope John Paul II]] and visit [[Assisi]]. It was on that trip that Bernardin made his funerary arrangements. Upon his return to Chicago, he arranged for the care for his mother, whom he visited daily at her nursing home,<ref name=Feister/> and the distribution of his personal possessions. Bernardin arranged for his personal papers and administrative files to be transported from the Residence and Pastoral Center to the Archdiocese of Chicago's Archives and Records Center.\n\nTwo weeks before his death, he completed his best-selling book about the end of life and about his own approaching death in particular, called ''The Gift Of Peace'', with the help of his friend and biographer [[Eugene Kennedy]].<ref name=\"peace\"/>\n\nIn his final weeks, he was also awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President Bill Clinton. He gave a major \"Seamless Garment of Life\" address at Georgetown University, where he received an award from and conversed with Father [[Leo J. O'Donovan]], S.J., then Georgetown's president.\n\nHe said goodbye to 800 of the diocesan and religious clergy of the Archdiocese at Holy Name Cathedral weeks before his death. On October 7, Bernardin met with the Presbyterate, and by the end of October, he withdrew from his active ministry due to his deteriorating strength. In his last days, Bernardin wrote to the [[United States Supreme Court]] against [[assisted suicide]].\n\nOn November 14, 1996, Bernardin died from [[pancreatic cancer]] at the age of 68.\n\nThe funeral [[homily]] was given by his friend Reverend Monsignor Kenneth Velo. In the weeks before his death, Bernardin emphasized to the faithful and the public that he was at peace because of his life's profound reliance on God's sustaining grace in his ministry and his struggles with cancer, seeing death as \"a continuation and a friend to prepare properly for by conducting ourselves well and letting go to abandon one's self to God in the end\". He was interred in the Bishops' Mausoleum at [[Mount Carmel Cemetery (Hillside)|Mt. Carmel Cemetery]], [[Hillside, Illinois]], following a [[Funeral Mass]] celebrated by his good friend, Cardinal [[Roger Mahony]], and a wake for priests at which his good friend Father Scott Donahue spoke.\n\n== Views ==\n=== Seamless garment of life ===\nIn 1983 Bernardin developed the \"[[Consistent Life Ethic|Consistent Ethic of Life]]\" (or CLE) ideology, which expressed his response to living in an age in which he believed modern technologies threatened the sanctity of human life. Bernardin's CLE philosophy is sometimes called the \"[[seamless garment]]\", a reference from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&chapter=19&verse=22&end_verse=24&version=49&context=context John 19:23] to the [[seamless robe of Jesus]]. The seamless garment philosophy holds that issues such as abortion, capital punishment, militarism, euthanasia, social injustice, and economic injustice all demand a consistent application of moral principles that value the sacredness of human life (as defined by the Catholic Church). In response to critiques from some [[anti-abortion]] activists, Bernardin said that the ethic did not describe all threats to life as equal but that all were related: \"A systemic vision of life seeks to expand the moral imagination of a society, not partition it into airtight categories. ... A consistent ethic of life seeks to present a coherent linkage among a diverse set of issues. It can and should be used to test party platforms, public policies, and political candidates.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bernardinwade.html|title=A Consistent Ethic of Life: Continuing the Dialogue|website=www.priestsforlife.org|access-date=May 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Other social issues ===\n\nIn 1981, Bernardin became head of the new [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops|NCCB]] Ad Hoc Committee on War and Peace, formed to draft a pastoral letter on nuclear proliferation.<ref name=\"McBrady 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=McBrady |first1=Jared |title=The Challenge of Peace: Ronald Reagan, John Paul II, and the American Bishops |journal=Journal of Cold War Studies |date=January 2015 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=129\u2013152 |doi=10.1162/JCWS_a_00533 |url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/JCWS_a_00533 |language=en |issn=1520-3972}}</ref> The resulting book-length letter, \"[[The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response]]\", was published in 1983.<ref name=\"McBrady 2015\"/> An influential statement of [[Catholic social teaching]], the document condemns nuclear warfare<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hansen |first1=Luke |title='The Challenge of Peace' Today |url=https://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/challenge-peace-today |accessdate=17 March 2020 |work=America Magazine |date=3 May 2013 |language=en}}</ref> and states that [[nuclear deterrence]] is \"not an adequate strategy as a long-term basis for peace; it is a transitional strategy justifiable only in conjunction with resolute determination to pursue arms control and disarmament\".<ref>{{cite document |url=http://www.usccb.org/upload/challenge-peace-gods-promise-our-response-1983.pdf|title=The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response|publisher=USCCB}}</ref> In relation to his work on the nuclear question, Bernardin was featured on the front cover of a 1982 issue of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' entitled \"God and the Bomb\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last1=Smith |editor-first1=Frank J. |work=Religion and Politics in America: An Encyclopedia of Church and State in American Life |date=2016 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-436-8 |title=Bernardin, Cardinal Joseph Louis (1928\u20131996)|last=Ortiz|first=Fernando A.|pages=55\u201356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWxyDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA56 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Ostling |first1=Richard N. |title=Bishops and the Bomb |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955097,00.html |work=Time |date=29 November 1982}}</ref>\n\nBernardin became a mediator between the diverging parties in the changing Post-Conciliar Church.

It lies like an army facing south, with one wing stretching along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean and the other reaching out to the Persian Gulf, while the center has its back against the northern mountains. The end of the western wing is Palestine; Assyria makes up a large part of the center; while the end of the eastern wing is Babylonia.<br/><br/>This great semicircle, for lack of a name, may be called the Fertile Crescent.<sup>1</sup> It may also be likened to the shores of a desert-bay, upon which the mountains behind look down\u2014a bay not of water but of sandy waste, some {{convert|500|mi|abbr=off|spell=on|disp=out}} across, forming a northern extension of the Arabian desert and sweeping as far north as the latitude of the northeast corner of the Mediterranean. This desert-bay is a limestone plateau of some height\u2014too high indeed to be watered by the Tigris and Euphrates, which have cut ca\u00f1ons obliquely across it. Nevertheless, after the meager winter rains, wide tracts of the northern desert-bay are clothed with scanty grass, and spring thus turns the region for a short time into grasslands. The history of Western Asia may be described as an age-long struggle between the mountain peoples of the north and the desert wanderers of these grasslands\u2014a struggle which is still going on\u2014for the possession of the Fertile Crescent, the shores of the desert-bay.<br/><br/><sup>1</sup> There is no name, either geographical or political, which includes all of this great semicircle (see map, p. 100). Hence we are obliged to coin a term and call it the Fertile Crescent.</blockquote>\n\nIn current usage, the Fertile Crescent includes [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], and [[Jordan]], as well as the surrounding portions of [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]]. In addition to the Tigris and Euphrates, riverwater sources include the [[Jordan River]]. The inner boundary is delimited by the dry climate of the [[Syrian Desert]] to the south. Around the outer boundary are the [[Anatolia]]n and [[Armenian highlands]] to the north, the [[Sahara Desert]] to the west, [[Sudan]] to the south, and the [[Iranian Plateau]] to the east.\n\n==Biodiversity and climate==\nAs crucial as rivers and [[marsh]]lands were to the [[Cradle of civilization|rise of civilization]] in the Fertile Crescent, they were not the only factor. The area is geographically important as the \"bridge\" between [[North Africa]] and [[Eurasia]], which has allowed it to retain a greater amount of [[biodiversity]] than either [[Europe]] or [[North Africa]], where [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]]s during the [[Ice Age]] led to repeated [[extinction]] events when ecosystems became squeezed against the waters of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The [[Saharan pump theory]] posits that this Middle Eastern [[land bridge]] was extremely important to the modern distribution of [[Old World]] [[flora]] and [[fauna]], including the [[Early human migrations|spread of humanity]].\n\nThe area has borne the brunt of the [[Divergent boundary|tectonic divergence]] between the African and Arabian [[tectonic plates|plates]] and the converging Arabian and Eurasian plates, which has made the region a very diverse zone of high snow-covered mountains.\n\nThe Fertile Crescent had many diverse [[climate]]s, and major climatic changes encouraged the evolution of many [[r/K strategy|\"r\" type]] [[annual plant]]s, which produce more edible seeds than [[r/K strategy|\"K\" type]] [[perennial plant]]s. The region's dramatic variety in elevation gave rise to many species of edible plants for early experiments in cultivation. Most importantly, the Fertile Crescent was home to the eight [[Neolithic founder crops]] important in early [[agriculture]] (i.e., wild progenitors to [[emmer|emmer wheat]], [[einkorn]], [[barley]], [[flax]], [[chick pea]], [[pea]], [[lentil]], [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]]), and four of the five most important species of [[domestication|domesticated]] animals\u2014[[cow]]s, [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[pig]]s; the fifth species, the [[horse]], lived nearby.<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\">{{cite book|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |last=Diamond |first=Jared |author-link=Jared Diamond |date=March 1997 |publisher=[[W.W.

It lies like an army facing south, with one wing stretching along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean and the other reaching out to the Persian Gulf, while the center has its back against the northern mountains. The end of the western wing is Palestine; Assyria makes up a large part of the center; while the end of the eastern wing is Babylonia.<br/><br/>This great semicircle, for lack of a name, may be called the Fertile Crescent.<sup>1</sup> It may also be likened to the shores of a desert-bay, upon which the mountains behind look down\u2014a bay not of water but of sandy waste, some {{convert|500|mi|abbr=off|spell=on|disp=out}} across, forming a northern extension of the Arabian desert and sweeping as far north as the latitude of the northeast corner of the Mediterranean. This desert-bay is a limestone plateau of some height\u2014too high indeed to be watered by the Tigris and Euphrates, which have cut ca\u00f1ons obliquely across it. Nevertheless, after the meager winter rains, wide tracts of the northern desert-bay are clothed with scanty grass, and spring thus turns the region for a short time into grasslands. The history of Western Asia may be described as an age-long struggle between the mountain peoples of the north and the desert wanderers of these grasslands\u2014a struggle which is still going on\u2014for the possession of the Fertile Crescent, the shores of the desert-bay.<br/><br/><sup>1</sup> There is no name, either geographical or political, which includes all of this great semicircle (see map, p. 100). Hence we are obliged to coin a term and call it the Fertile Crescent.</blockquote>\n\nIn current usage, the Fertile Crescent includes [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], and [[Jordan]], as well as the surrounding portions of [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]]. In addition to the Tigris and Euphrates, riverwater sources include the [[Jordan River]]. The inner boundary is delimited by the dry climate of the [[Syrian Desert]] to the south. Around the outer boundary are the [[Anatolia]]n and [[Armenian highlands]] to the north, the [[Sahara Desert]] to the west, [[Sudan]] to the south, and the [[Iranian Plateau]] to the east.\n\n==Biodiversity and climate==\nAs crucial as rivers and [[marsh]]lands were to the [[Cradle of civilization|rise of civilization]] in the Fertile Crescent, they were not the only factor. The area is geographically important as the \"bridge\" between [[North Africa]] and [[Eurasia]], which has allowed it to retain a greater amount of [[biodiversity]] than either [[Europe]] or [[North Africa]], where [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]]s during the [[Ice Age]] led to repeated [[extinction]] events when ecosystems became squeezed against the waters of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

Cessna reported that the decision was made to save money and also that the company had no more plant capacity in the United States at the time. Cessna received much negative feedback for this decision, with complaints centering on the recent quality problems with Chinese production of other consumer products, China's human rights record, exporting of jobs, and China's less than friendly political relationship with the United States.

In early 2009, the company attracted further criticism for continuing plans to build the 162 in China while laying off large numbers of workers in the United States.

The compilation of this list, in collaboration with his assistant [[Pierre M\u00e9chain]], is known as ''the Messier catalogue.''

For example, Messier 1 is a [[supernova remnant]], known as the [[Crab Nebula]], and the great [[spiral galaxy|spiral]] [[Andromeda Galaxy]] is M31. Many further inclusions followed in the next century when the first addition came from [[Nicolas Camille Flammarion]] in 1921, who added [[Messier 104]] after finding Messier's side note in his 1781 edition exemplar of the catalogue. [[Messier 105|M105]] to [[Messier 107|M107]] were added by [[Helen Sawyer Hogg]] in 1947, [[Messier 108|M108]] and [[Messier 109|M109]] by [[Owen Gingerich]] in 1960, and [[Messier 110|M110]] by Kenneth Glyn Jones in 1967.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | first= Patrick\n | last= Moore\n | date= 1979\n | title= The Guinness Book of Astronomy\n | publisher= [[Guinness Superlatives]]\n | isbn= 978-0-900424-76-2\n | url-access= registration\n | url= https://archive.org/details/guinnessbookofas00moor\n }}\n</ref>\n\n==Lists and editions==\n[[File:Charles Messier.jpg|275px|thumb|[[Charles Messier]]|alt=Painting of Charles Messier]]\n\nThe first edition of 1771 covered 45 objects numbered [[Crab Nebula|M1]] to [[Pleiades|M45]]. The total list published by Messier in 1781 contained 103 objects, but the list was expanded through successive additions by other astronomers, motivated by notes in Messier's and M\u00e9chain's texts indicating that at least one of them knew of the additional objects.

Since the UK is always in or close to the path of the polar front [[jet stream]], frequent changes in pressure and unsettled weather are typical. Many types of weather can be experienced in a single day. In general the climate of the UK is cool and often cloudy and rainy, and high temperatures are infrequent. \n\nThe climate in the United Kingdom is defined as a [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate]], or ''Cfb'' on the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, a classification it shares with most of north-west Europe.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Peel, M. C. |author2=Finlayson B. L. |author3=McMahon, T. A. | year=2007 | title= Updated world map of the K\u00f6ppen&ndash;Geiger climate classification | journal=Hydrol. Earth Syst.

[[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]] and western parts of [[England]] and [[Scotland]], being closest to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], are generally the mildest, wettest and windiest regions of the UK, and [[Atmospheric temperature|temperature ranges]] here are seldom extreme. Eastern areas are drier, cooler, and less windy, and also experience the greatest daily and seasonal temperature variations. Northern areas are generally cooler and wetter, and have slightly larger temperature ranges than southern areas.\n\nThe UK is mostly under the influence of the maritime polar [[air mass]] from the north-west. Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland are the most exposed to the maritime polar air mass which brings cool moist air; the east of Scotland and north-east England are more exposed to the continental polar air mass which brings cold dry air. The south and south-east of England are the least exposed to polar air masses from the north-west, and on occasion see continental tropical air masses from the south, which bring warm dry air in the summer. On average, the temperature ranges from {{convert|18| to |25|C}}.\n\nIf the air masses are strong enough in their respective areas during the summer, there can sometimes be a large difference in temperature between the far north of Scotland (including its islands) and the south-east of England \u2013 often a difference of 10-15 \u00b0C (18-27 \u00b0F) but sometimes as much as 20 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F) or more. In the height of summer the Northern Isles can have temperatures around {{convert|15|C}}, while the areas around London reach {{convert|36|C}}.\n\n==England==\n[[File:England K\u00f6ppen.png|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] in England]]\n\nEngland generally has higher maximum and minimum temperatures than the other areas of the UK, though Wales has higher minima from November to February, and Northern Ireland has higher maxima from December to February. England is also sunnier throughout the year, but unlike Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the sunniest month is July, with an average of 193.5 hours. It rains on fewer days in every month throughout the year than the rest of the UK, and rainfall totals are less in every month, with the driest month, May, averaging {{convert|58.4|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"England\" /> The [[climate of south-west England]] displays a seasonal temperature variation, although it is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom. Gales are less common in England compared to Scotland; however on some occasions there can be strong winds, and rarely, the remains of Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms. Some events such as the [[Great Storm of 1987]] occurred near to the UK and caused damage in England.\nThe prevailing wind direction for England is from the south-west.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

Spring is generally a calm, cool season, particularly because the Atlantic has lost much of its heat throughout the autumn and winter. As the sun rises higher in the sky and the days get longer, temperatures slowly rise, but the solar effect is mitigated somewhat by the effect of the cool ocean waters and westerly winds that blow across them.\n\nThere is a fair chance of snow earlier in the season when temperatures are colder; often in March. Some of the country's heaviest snowfalls of recent years have happened in the first half of March, and snow showers can occur infrequently until mid-April. They have been known to develop as late as mid-May over some areas of the country, such as in 2013 when snow was recorded on 14 May over parts of Staffordshire, Herefordshire and Wales. Snow was also recorded at lower levels in early June 1975. More recently, there was a disruptive snow event between 26 and 29 April 2016 across much of Northern England and Scotland, which was unusually the only significant snow event of the winter 2015/16. Snow, frost and ice can be disruptive and damaging to flowering plants, particularly later in the spring.\n\nEarly spring can be quite cold, and occasionally the lowest temperature of the winter can occur in March, as it did at Heathrow Airport on 5 March 2001, 4 March 2006 and 8 March 2011. Temperatures below freezing are not unusual in March, even in the south of the UK. On the other hand, high temperatures above {{convert|30|C}} are generally rare, but can occur on occasion; most recently on 25 May 2012. It was even hotter on 27 May 2005, when {{convert|31.9|C}} was recorded in London. Rarely, the hottest day of the year can be in spring. As stated below, 27 May was the hottest day of the year in 2012 in most parts of the UK. In [[Aberdaron]], the hottest day of 2011 was very early on in the year on 21 April. Temperatures in March seldom reach {{convert|20|C}}, as they did in 1990, 1993, 2012 and 2017, and this temperature is usually reached for the first time in April or May. Throughout spring, there can be large temperature swings between day and night. On 9 April 2017, night-time temperatures fell to just {{convert|3|C}} at Northolt, but {{convert|25|C}} was reached in the afternoon. Warmth in spring depends almost entirely on the strength of the sun, and can trigger thunderstorms and downpours.\n\nMean temperatures in Spring are markedly influenced by latitude.

This can combine with the warm ocean due to heating throughout the spring and summer, to produce some unsettled weather. In addition, the land may become colder than the ocean, resulting in significant amounts of [[condensation]] and rain-bearing clouds.\n\nAtlantic depressions at this time can become intense, and winds of [[hurricane]] force (greater than {{convert|119|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) can be recorded. Western areas, closest to the Atlantic, experience these severe conditions more often than eastern areas. Autumn, particularly the latter part, is often the stormiest time of the year. One particularly intense depression was the [[Great Storm of 1987]]. A very severe storm also affected the UK on 27 October 2002. At Mumbles Head near Swansea, a maximum sustained wind speed of over 123&nbsp;km/h was recorded: equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/10-2002/ws-36090.html|title=Climate MUMBLES (October 2002) - Climate data (36090)|first=Tutiempo Network|last=S.L|website=www.tutiempo.net}}</ref> The autumn of 2013 was also littered with severe storms, including the St. Jude's Storm on 28 October 2013.\n\nAutumn can sometimes be a cold season - in recent years, very low temperatures and heavy snowfall have been recorded during November 1985, November 1993 and November 2010. There was a new record low of {{convert|-18.0|C}} in Wales on 28 November 2010. At Northolt, in Greater London, the coldest temperature of the year 2016 was set on 30 November.

Even further south, low temperatures can be recorded, with temperatures well below freezing as far south as Heathrow Airport on 29\u201331 October 1997, with a lower temperature than any recorded at this station in March, November or December 1997 and even the following January 1998; only on 2 and 4 February 1998 were lower temperatures recorded here that winter. The first frost of the winter usually occurs between October and December; frost is quite unusual in September, when the surrounding ocean is at or near its warmest, except on high ground.

The season is generally cool, wet, windy, and cloudy. Temperatures at night rarely drop below {{convert|-10|C}} and in the day rarely rise above {{convert|15|C|F|0}}. Precipitation can be plentiful throughout the season, though snow is relatively infrequent despite the country's high latitude: often the only areas with significant snowfall are the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the [[Pennines]], where at higher elevations a colder climate determines the vegetation, mainly temperate coniferous forest, although deforestation has severely decreased the forest area. For a majority of the UK, snow is frequent in winter time yet is usually light and doesn't last long, apart from the higher altitudes, where snow can lie for 1\u20135 months or even beyond 6 months.<ref>https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/snow/snow-in-the-uk</ref>\n\nTowards the later part of the season the weather usually stabilises with less wind, less precipitation and lower temperatures. This change is particularly pronounced near the coasts, mainly because the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is often at its coldest at this time after being cooled throughout the autumn and the winter. The early part of winter however is often unsettled and stormy; often the wettest and windiest time of the year.\n\n[[File:Saddle and sgurr na sgine 06-07 086.jpg|thumb|left|Snow cover on [[The Saddle]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]]]]\nSnow falls intermittently and mainly affects northern and eastern areas, high ground in Wales and especially the mountains of [[Scotland]], where there is often enough snow lying to permit [[skiing]] at some of the five [[List of ski areas and resorts in Europe#Scotland|Scottish ski resorts]]. These resorts usually operate between December and April, depending on the snowfall. Frequently in the mountains potent depressions may move in from the north in the form of \"[[polar low]]s\", introducing heavy snow and often [[blizzard]]-like conditions to parts of the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland. Blizzards have become rarer in the 21st century, although much of England was affected by one on 30 January 2003. During periods of light winds and high pressure, [[frost]] and [[fog]] can become a problem and can pose a major hazard to drivers.\n\nMean winter temperatures in the UK are most influenced by proximity to the sea.

The UK can suffer extreme winters like 1684, 1740, 1795 (when London had its record lowest temperature of {{convert|-21.1|C|F|1}}, 1947 and 1963. In 1962 it snowed on [[Boxing Day]], and snow lasted in most areas until 6 March, with blizzards through February, which had significant and documented effects on the [[FA Cup]] - Wrexham were forced to play on sand for one tie. In recent times snow has generally become rarer, but the UK can still get heavy falls, such as in 1978\u201379, 1981\u201382, [[January 1987 South-East England snowfall|1986-87]] and [[Winter of 1990\u20131991 in Western Europe|1990-91]]. The [[February 2009 Great Britain and Ireland snowfall|winter of 2008/09]] produced the heaviest snowfall since 1991 between 1 and 3 February, and the [[Winter of 2009\u20132010 in Europe|winter of 2009-10]] was even more severe, with many parts of the United Kingdom having the coldest and snowiest winters since 1978/79; temperatures plummeted to {{convert|-22.3|C}} at [[Altnaharra]], Sutherland \u2013 close to the {{convert|-22.9|C}} recorded in Antarctica in the same period. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the UK was {{convert|-27.2|C}}, on 10 January 1982 and 11 February 1895 in [[Braemar]], Scotland and on 30 December 1995 in Altnaharra. December 2010 was the coldest December in 120 years; the CET (Central England Temperature) was {{convert|-0.7|C}}; it was the coldest month since February 1986, and the coldest December since 1890. Many places had heavy snowfall and extreme cold, temperatures regularly fell below {{convert|-10.0|C|F|1}} across many areas. However, the cold subsided after Christmas Day, 2010. November 2010 saw an extremely severe cold snap, with lows of {{convert|-18.0|C|F|1}} in Llysdinam on 28 November. The month saw temperatures below average, despite what was actually a very mild first half. Spring 2013 was also cold: March 2013 was the coldest month of the winter (and indeed 2013 as a whole), which is quite striking given that December 2012, January and February 2013 were all also below average in terms of temperature. The following winter was the opposite: in many places, only on 11 and 12 January was any snow recorded (some places having no snow at all), and the entire country was battered by a series of severe depressions and storms. The St Jude's Day storm first affected the UK on 26 October 2013, and many places saw no respite until a [[high pressure|high]] swept across the country on 2 March 2014. Some places in the [[Somerset Levels]] remained under water for most of the winter and well into spring. Record-equalling gusts of 142&nbsp;mph were recorded off the north coast of Scotland on 5 December 2013, with notably severe storms also recorded on 2 November 2013, 24 December 2013, 3 January 2014 and 14 February 2014.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, most of the winters were milder and usually wetter than average, with below-freezing daytime temperatures a rare occurrence. In fact, the winter of 1995/1996 was the only one which was defined as below average in terms of the UK as a whole, although February 1991 saw heavy snowfall and January 1997 was cold in the South. The winters of 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11, however, had below or well below average temperatures, with large snowfall amounts widespread and very low temperatures; this was the first series of three consecutive cold winters in the UK since the 1960s. The winter of 2012/13 was very cold too, although the peak of the cold was in March.<ref>https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/case-studies/widespread-snow-march-2013</ref> The winter of 2014/2015 was an oddity: it was generally quiet and sunny. December 2014 and January 2015 were a little milder than the average; February 2015 was close to normal. The winter of 2016/17 was very nearly a very cold winter owing to the presence and position of high pressure, although ultimately only November 2016 was cold widely as a whole. Early December 2016 was cool and January 2017 was cold in the south-east, with much of the rest of England and Wales near the 1961-1990 average. At Northolt, the average daily minimum for January 2017 was below freezing for the first time since December 2010. The winter of 2017/18 was then much colder than average too. However, mild temperatures prevailed during winter 2018/19.<ref>https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/summaries/anomacts</ref>\n\nDecember 2015 was the wettest calendar month ever recorded in the United Kingdom, and January 2016 the second wettest.

This [[thermohaline circulation]] has a powerful moderating and warming effect on the country's climate. This warm water current warms the climate to such a great extent that if the current did not exist then temperatures in winter would be about {{convert|10|C-change}} lower than they are today and similar to eastern Russia or Canada near the same latitude. The current allows England to have [[vineyard]]s at the same latitude that [[Canada]] has [[polar bear]]s. These warm [[ocean current]]s also bring substantial amounts of [[humidity]] which contributes to the notoriously wet climate that western parts of the UK experience.\n\n==Winds==\n{{further|List of atmospheric pressure records in Europe}}\nThe high latitude and proximity to a large ocean to the west means that the United Kingdom experiences strong winds. The prevailing wind is from the south-west, but it may blow from any direction for sustained periods of time. Winds are strongest near westerly facing coasts and exposed [[headland]]s.\n\n[[Gale]]s &mdash; which are defined as winds with speeds of {{convert|51|to|101|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}&mdash; are strongly associated with the passage of deep depressions across the country. The [[Hebrides]] experience on average 35 days of gale a year (a day where there are gale-force winds) while inland areas in England and Wales receive fewer than 5 days of gale a year.<ref name=\"Englandclimate\" /> Areas of high [[elevation]] tend to have higher wind speeds than low elevations, and [[Great Dun Fell]] in [[Cumbria]] (at {{convert|857|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) averaged 114 days of gale a year during the period 1963 to 1976.

In Scotland, Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire recorded {{convert|142|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} on 13 February 1989, which was equalled during Cyclone Xaver on 5 December 2013. Wales' highest wind speed gust of {{convert|124|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} was set at Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan on 28 October 1989. Especially potent storm systems typically affect the UK during autumn and winter, with the winters of 1989/1990 and 2013/2014 particularly notable for the frequency and potency of storm systems.\n\nAn unofficial gust of 194&nbsp;mph was recorded in the Shetland Isles during the [[New Year's Day Storm]] on 1 January 1992, and an equal unofficial 194&nbsp;mph wind gust is claimed to have been set in the Cairngorm Mountains on 19 December 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/4141762/Highlands-mountain-claims-strongest-UK-wind.html|title=Highlands mountain claims strongest UK wind|first=Nick|last=Britten|date=25 June 2018|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nBarometric pressure plays a role in storm systems.

During some periods it was much warmer and in others it was much colder. The [[last glacial period]] was a period of extreme cold weather that lasted for tens of thousands of years and ended about 10,000 years ago. During this period the temperature was so low that much of the surrounding ocean froze and a great [[ice sheet]] extended over all of the United Kingdom except the south of [[England]] (connected to mainland Europe via the dry English Channel) and southern coastal areas of [[Wales]].\n\nThe cold period from the 16th to the mid-19th centuries is known as the [[Little Ice Age]].\n\nThe temperature records in England are continuous back to the mid 17th century. The [[Central England temperature]] (CET) record is the oldest in the world, and is a compound source of cross-correlated records from several locations in central England. Precipitation records date back to the eighteenth century and the modern [[England and Wales Precipitation]] series begins in 1766.\n\nA detailed narrative account of the weather of every year from 1913 to 1942, with photographs of plants taken on the same day in each of those years, may be found in Willis (1944).<ref>Willis, J. H., (1944) ''Weatherwise'', London, George Allen and Unwin.</ref>\n\nAs with many parts of the world, over the last century the United Kingdom has reported a warming trend in temperatures. While some of this may be due to a recovery from the cooler period of climate mid 20th century (particularly the 1960s) the last 20 years has nonetheless seen an unprecedented level of warm weather. In July 2019, [[BBC]] reported that records from the [[Met Office]] show that the 10 warmest years in the UK have occurred since 2002, with 2014 being the warmest. In the same period, the coolest year has been 2010; however, this still only ranks 22nd on the overall list of coolest years on record.<ref>{{Cite

Since the UK is always in or close to the path of the polar front [[jet stream]], frequent changes in pressure and unsettled weather are typical. Many types of weather can be experienced in a single day. In general the climate of the UK is cool and often cloudy and rainy, and high temperatures are infrequent. \n\nThe climate in the United Kingdom is defined as a [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate]], or ''Cfb'' on the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, a classification it shares with most of north-west Europe.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Peel, M.

[[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]] and western parts of [[England]] and [[Scotland]], being closest to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], are generally the mildest, wettest and windiest regions of the UK, and [[Atmospheric temperature|temperature ranges]] here are seldom extreme. Eastern areas are drier, cooler, and less windy, and also experience the greatest daily and seasonal temperature variations. Northern areas are generally cooler and wetter, and have slightly larger temperature ranges than southern areas.\n\nThe UK is mostly under the influence of the maritime polar [[air mass]] from the north-west. Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland are the most exposed to the maritime polar air mass which brings cool moist air; the east of Scotland and north-east England are more exposed to the continental polar air mass which brings cold dry air. The south and south-east of England are the least exposed to polar air masses from the north-west, and on occasion see continental tropical air masses from the south, which bring warm dry air in the summer. On average, the temperature ranges from {{convert|18| to |25|C}}.\n\nIf the air masses are strong enough in their respective areas during the summer, there can sometimes be a large difference in temperature between the far north of Scotland (including its islands) and the south-east of England \u2013 often a difference of 10-15 \u00b0C (18-27 \u00b0F) but sometimes as much as 20 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F) or more. In the height of summer the Northern Isles can have temperatures around {{convert|15|C}}, while the areas around London reach {{convert|36|C}}.\n\n==England==\n[[File:England K\u00f6ppen.png|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] in England]]\n\nEngland generally has higher maximum and minimum temperatures than the other areas of the UK, though Wales has higher minima from November to February, and Northern Ireland has higher maxima from December to February. England is also sunnier throughout the year, but unlike Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the sunniest month is July, with an average of 193.5 hours. It rains on fewer days in every month throughout the year than the rest of the UK, and rainfall totals are less in every month, with the driest month, May, averaging {{convert|58.4|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"England\" /> The [[climate of south-west England]] displays a seasonal temperature variation, although it is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom. Gales are less common in England compared to Scotland; however on some occasions there can be strong winds, and rarely, the remains of Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms. Some events such as the [[Great Storm of 1987]] occurred near to the UK and caused damage in England.\nThe prevailing wind direction for England is from the south-west.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

Spring is generally a calm, cool season, particularly because the Atlantic has lost much of its heat throughout the autumn and winter. As the sun rises higher in the sky and the days get longer, temperatures slowly rise, but the solar effect is mitigated somewhat by the effect of the cool ocean waters and westerly winds that blow across them.\n\nThere is a fair chance of snow earlier in the season when temperatures are colder; often in March. Some of the country's heaviest snowfalls of recent years have happened in the first half of March, and snow showers can occur infrequently until mid-April. They have been known to develop as late as mid-May over some areas of the country, such as in 2013 when snow was recorded on 14 May over parts of Staffordshire, Herefordshire and Wales. Snow was also recorded at lower levels in early June 1975. More recently, there was a disruptive snow event between 26 and 29 April 2016 across much of Northern England and Scotland, which was unusually the only significant snow event of the winter 2015/16. Snow, frost and ice can be disruptive and damaging to flowering plants, particularly later in the spring.\n\nEarly spring can be quite cold, and occasionally the lowest temperature of the winter can occur in March, as it did at Heathrow Airport on 5 March 2001, 4 March 2006 and 8 March 2011. Temperatures below freezing are not unusual in March, even in the south of the UK. On the other hand, high temperatures above {{convert|30|C}} are generally rare, but can occur on occasion; most recently on 25 May 2012. It was even hotter on 27 May 2005, when {{convert|31.9|C}} was recorded in London. Rarely, the hottest day of the year can be in spring. As stated below, 27 May was the hottest day of the year in 2012 in most parts of the UK. In [[Aberdaron]], the hottest day of 2011 was very early on in the year on 21 April. Temperatures in March seldom reach {{convert|20|C}}, as they did in 1990, 1993, 2012 and 2017, and this temperature is usually reached for the first time in April or May. Throughout spring, there can be large temperature swings between day and night. On 9 April 2017, night-time temperatures fell to just {{convert|3|C}} at Northolt, but {{convert|25|C}} was reached in the afternoon. Warmth in spring depends almost entirely on the strength of the sun, and can trigger thunderstorms and downpours.\n\nMean temperatures in Spring are markedly influenced by latitude. Most of Scotland and the mountains of Wales and northern England are the coolest areas of the UK, with average temperatures ranging from {{convert|-0.6|to|5.8|C|F|1}}.<ref name=\"spring\">{{cite web | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/13.gif | title = Mean Temperature Spring Average | accessdate = 14 August 2007 | publisher = Met Office | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030548/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/13.gif | archivedate = 27 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The southern half of England experiences the warmest spring temperatures of between {{convert|8.8|and|10.3|C|F|1}}.<ref name=\"spring\" />\n\n===Summer===\nSummer lasts from June to August and is the warmest and usually the sunniest season.

This can combine with the warm ocean due to heating throughout the spring and summer, to produce some unsettled weather. In addition, the land may become colder than the ocean, resulting in significant amounts of [[condensation]] and rain-bearing clouds.\n\nAtlantic depressions at this time can become intense, and winds of [[hurricane]] force (greater than {{convert|119|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) can be recorded. Western areas, closest to the Atlantic, experience these severe conditions more often than eastern areas. Autumn, particularly the latter part, is often the stormiest time of the year. One particularly intense depression was the [[Great Storm of 1987]]. A very severe storm also affected the UK on 27 October 2002. At Mumbles Head near Swansea, a maximum sustained wind speed of over 123&nbsp;km/h was recorded: equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/10-2002/ws-36090.html|title=Climate MUMBLES (October 2002) - Climate data (36090)|first=Tutiempo Network|last=S.L|website=www.tutiempo.net}}</ref> The autumn of 2013 was also littered with severe storms, including the St. Jude's Storm on 28 October 2013.\n\nAutumn can sometimes be a cold season - in recent years, very low temperatures and heavy snowfall have been recorded during November 1985, November 1993 and November 2010. There was a new record low of {{convert|-18.0|C}} in Wales on 28 November 2010. At Northolt, in Greater London, the coldest temperature of the year 2016 was set on 30 November. Snow also fell rather widely across the UK on 28\u201329 October 2008, causing traffic problems where it settled on the M4. Even further south, low temperatures can be recorded, with temperatures well below freezing as far south as Heathrow Airport on 29\u201331 October 1997, with a lower temperature than any recorded at this station in March, November or December 1997 and even the following January 1998; only on 2 and 4 February 1998 were lower temperatures recorded here that winter. The first frost of the winter usually occurs between October and December; frost is quite unusual in September, when the surrounding ocean is at or near its warmest, except on high ground. It is not particularly unusual for September to be warmer than June, as it was in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-weather.eu/article.138.html|title=London Weather - 1999 Mild, rather wet, and very thundery.|author=|date=|website=www.london-weather.eu}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the United Kingdom sometimes experiences an \"Indian summer\", when temperatures, particularly by night, can be very mild and rarely fall below {{convert|10|C|F|0}}. Such events are aided by the surrounding Atlantic Ocean and seas being at their warmest, keeping the country in warm air, despite the relatively weak sun. Examples of this were in 1985, 1999, 2005, 2006, 2011<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/03/uk-weather-normal-record-heatwave?newsfeed=true | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sam | last=Jones | title=UK weather returns to normal after record-breaking heatwave | date=3 October 2011}}</ref> and 2016 when September saw above average temperatures which felt more like a continuation of summer than autumn. Autumns since 2000 have generally been very mild, with notable extremes of precipitation; the UK has seen some of its wettest and driest autumns since the millennium. 2011 and 2016 were notable as many areas of the country recorded their highest temperatures of the year in September and October (for example, {{convert|28.2|C}} at Hawarden on 1 October, {{convert|26.3|C}} at St. Athan on 2 October 2011 and the UK's highest temperature of 2016 on 13 September with {{convert|34.4|C}} at Gravesend).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/13/uks-hottest-september-day-since-1949-32c-heathrow|title=UK's hottest September day in 105 years sets 2016 record|first=Damien|last=Gayle|date=13 September 2016|website=the Guardian}}</ref> On 13 October 2018, temperatures reached {{convert|26.5|C}} at Donna Nook in Lincolnshire, the latest in the year such a high temperature had been recorded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/local-news/16-degree-swing-saw-go-2109033|title=From UK's hottest place to a taste of winter in just 24 hours|date=15 October 2018|publisher=Grimsby Telegraph}}</ref> Temperatures on the night of 12\u201313 October were also just under {{convert|20|C}} in London.\n\nCoastal areas in the southern half of England have on average the warmest autumns, with mean temperatures of {{convert|10.7|to|13.0|C|F|1}}.<ref name=\"autumn\">{{cite web | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/15.gif | title = Mean Temperature Autumn Average | accessdate = 14 August 2007 | publisher = Met Office | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030823/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/15.gif | archivedate = 27 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Mountainous areas of Wales and northern England, and almost all of Scotland, experience mean temperatures between {{convert|1.7|and|7.5|C|F|1}}.<ref name=\"autumn\" />\n[[File:UK zonemap.png|thumb|upright|[[Hardiness zone]]s in the [[British Isles]]. Based on the [[USDA]] system and used to indicate growing conditions for plants.]]\n\n===Winter===\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=September 2018}}\nWinter in the [[UK]] is defined as lasting from December to February. The season is generally cool, wet, windy, and cloudy. Temperatures at night rarely drop below {{convert|-10|C}} and in the day rarely rise above {{convert|15|C|F|0}}. Precipitation can be plentiful throughout the season, though snow is relatively infrequent despite the country's high latitude: often the only areas with significant snowfall are the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the [[Pennines]], where at higher elevations a colder climate determines the vegetation, mainly temperate coniferous forest, although deforestation has severely decreased the forest area. For a majority of the UK, snow is frequent in winter time yet is usually light and doesn't last long, apart from the higher altitudes, where snow can lie for 1\u20135 months or even beyond 6 months.<ref>https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/snow/snow-in-the-uk</ref>\n\nTowards the later part of the season the weather usually stabilises with less wind, less precipitation and lower temperatures. This change is particularly pronounced near the coasts, mainly because the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is often at its coldest at this time after being cooled throughout the autumn and the winter. The early part of winter however is often unsettled and stormy; often the wettest and windiest time of the year.\n\n[[File:Saddle and sgurr na sgine 06-07 086.jpg|thumb|left|Snow cover on [[The Saddle]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]]]]\nSnow falls intermittently and mainly affects northern and eastern areas, high ground in Wales and especially the mountains of [[Scotland]], where there is often enough snow lying to permit [[skiing]] at some of the five [[List of ski areas and resorts in Europe#Scotland|Scottish ski resorts]]. These resorts usually operate between December and April, depending on the snowfall. Frequently in the mountains potent depressions may move in from the north in the form of \"[[polar low]]s\", introducing heavy snow and often [[blizzard]]-like conditions to parts of the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland. Blizzards have become rarer in the 21st century, although much of England was affected by one on 30 January 2003.

The UK can suffer extreme winters like 1684, 1740, 1795 (when London had its record lowest temperature of {{convert|-21.1|C|F|1}}, 1947 and 1963. In 1962 it snowed on [[Boxing Day]], and snow lasted in most areas until 6 March, with blizzards through February, which had significant and documented effects on the [[FA Cup]] - Wrexham were forced to play on sand for one tie. In recent times snow has generally become rarer, but the UK can still get heavy falls, such as in 1978\u201379, 1981\u201382, [[January 1987 South-East England snowfall|1986-87]] and [[Winter of 1990\u20131991 in Western Europe|1990-91]]. The [[February 2009 Great Britain and Ireland snowfall|winter of 2008/09]] produced the heaviest snowfall since 1991 between 1 and 3 February, and the [[Winter of 2009\u20132010 in Europe|winter of 2009-10]] was even more severe, with many parts of the United Kingdom having the coldest and snowiest winters since 1978/79; temperatures plummeted to {{convert|-22.3|C}} at [[Altnaharra]], Sutherland \u2013 close to the {{convert|-22.9|C}} recorded in Antarctica in the same period. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the UK was {{convert|-27.2|C}}, on 10 January 1982 and 11 February 1895 in [[Braemar]], Scotland and on 30 December 1995 in Altnaharra. December 2010 was the coldest December in 120 years; the CET (Central England Temperature) was {{convert|-0.7|C}}; it was the coldest month since February 1986, and the coldest December since 1890. Many places had heavy snowfall and extreme cold, temperatures regularly fell below {{convert|-10.0|C|F|1}} across many areas. However, the cold subsided after Christmas Day, 2010. November 2010 saw an extremely severe cold snap, with lows of {{convert|-18.0|C|F|1}} in Llysdinam on 28 November. The month saw temperatures below average, despite what was actually a very mild first half. Spring 2013 was also cold: March 2013 was the coldest month of the winter (and indeed 2013 as a whole), which is quite striking given that December 2012, January and February 2013 were all also below average in terms of temperature. The following winter was the opposite: in many places, only on 11 and 12 January was any snow recorded (some places having no snow at all), and the entire country was battered by a series of severe depressions and storms. The St Jude's Day storm first affected the UK on 26 October 2013, and many places saw no respite until a [[high pressure|high]] swept across the country on 2 March 2014. Some places in the [[Somerset Levels]] remained under water for most of the winter and well into spring. Record-equalling gusts of 142&nbsp;mph were recorded off the north coast of Scotland on 5 December 2013, with notably severe storms also recorded on 2 November 2013, 24 December 2013, 3 January 2014 and 14 February 2014.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, most of the winters were milder and usually wetter than average, with below-freezing daytime temperatures a rare occurrence. In fact, the winter of 1995/1996 was the only one which was defined as below average in terms of the UK as a whole, although February 1991 saw heavy snowfall and January 1997 was cold in the South. The winters of 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11, however, had below or well below average temperatures, with large snowfall amounts widespread and very low temperatures; this was the first series of three consecutive cold winters in the UK since the 1960s.

December 2014 and January 2015 were a little milder than the average; February 2015 was close to normal. The winter of 2016/17 was very nearly a very cold winter owing to the presence and position of high pressure, although ultimately only November 2016 was cold widely as a whole. Early December 2016 was cool and January 2017 was cold in the south-east, with much of the rest of England and Wales near the 1961-1990 average. At Northolt, the average daily minimum for January 2017 was below freezing for the first time since December 2010. The winter of 2017/18 was then much colder than average too.

This [[thermohaline circulation]] has a powerful moderating and warming effect on the country's climate. This warm water current warms the climate to such a great extent that if the current did not exist then temperatures in winter would be about {{convert|10|C-change}} lower than they are today and similar to eastern Russia or Canada near the same latitude. The current allows England to have [[vineyard]]s at the same latitude that [[Canada]] has [[polar bear]]s. These warm [[ocean current]]s also bring substantial amounts of [[humidity]] which contributes to the notoriously wet climate that western parts of the UK experience.\n\n==Winds==\n{{further|List of atmospheric pressure records in Europe}}\nThe high latitude and proximity to a large ocean to the west means that the United Kingdom experiences strong winds. The prevailing wind is from the south-west, but it may blow from any direction for sustained periods of time. Winds are strongest near westerly facing coasts and exposed [[headland]]s.\n\n[[Gale]]s &mdash; which are defined as winds with speeds of {{convert|51|to|101|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}&mdash; are strongly associated with the passage of deep depressions across the country. The [[Hebrides]] experience on average 35 days of gale a year (a day where there are gale-force winds) while inland areas in England and Wales receive fewer than 5 days of gale a year.<ref name=\"Englandclimate\" /> Areas of high [[elevation]] tend to have higher wind speeds than low elevations, and [[Great Dun Fell]] in [[Cumbria]] (at {{convert|857|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) averaged 114 days of gale a year during the period 1963 to 1976. The highest [[wind|gust]] recorded at a low level in England was {{convert|191|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} at [[Gwennap Head]] in [[Cornwall]] on 15 December 1979,<ref name=\"Englandclimate\" /> and a 115&nbsp;mph gust was also recorded at Shoreham-By-Sea on 16 October 1987.

In Scotland, Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire recorded {{convert|142|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} on 13 February 1989, which was equalled during Cyclone Xaver on 5 December 2013. Wales' highest wind speed gust of {{convert|124|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} was set at Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan on 28 October 1989. Especially potent storm systems typically affect the UK during autumn and winter, with the winters of 1989/1990 and 2013/2014 particularly notable for the frequency and potency of storm systems.\n\nAn unofficial gust of 194&nbsp;mph was recorded in the Shetland Isles during the [[New Year's Day Storm]] on 1 January 1992, and an equal unofficial 194&nbsp;mph wind gust is claimed to have been set in the Cairngorm Mountains on 19 December 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/4141762/Highlands-mountain-claims-strongest-UK-wind.html|title=Highlands mountain claims strongest UK wind|first=Nick|last=Britten|date=25 June 2018|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nBarometric pressure plays a role in storm systems.

Both registered F2 on the Fujita scale and both caused significant damage and injury. The largest ever recorded was thought to have been an F4, again in [[London tornado of 1091|London in 1091]]. The most deadly occurred on 28 December 1879. All 74 lives were lost when a passenger train plunged from the Tay Bridge (Tayside) into the Tay Estuary, when the middle section of the bridge collapsed. Although the bridge was poorly constructed and had already been weakened in earlier gales (including the pre-existing winds at the time of the tragedy), the ultimate failure is believed to have been caused by two or three waterspouts which were sighted close to the bridge immediately before the accident.<ref name=\"torro.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.torro.org.uk/site/whirlwind_info.php|title=TORRO - British & European Tornado Extremes|author=|date=|website=www.torro.org.uk}}</ref> A tornado also developed in London on 3 July 2007.\n\n[[File:Nintchdbpict000003669438.jpg|thumb|Birmingham tornado July 2005]]\nThe UK also holds the title for the highest known 'outbreak' of tornadoes outside of the United States.  The largest tornado outbreak in Britain is also the largest tornado outbreak known anywhere in Europe. On 23 November 1981, 105 tornadoes were spawned by a cold front in the space of 5.25 hours. Excepting Derbyshire, every county in a triangular area from Gwynedd to Humberside to Essex was hit by at least one tornado, while Norfolk was hit by at least 13. Very fortunately most tornadoes were short-lived and also weak (the strongest was around T5 on the [[TORRO scale|TORRO Tornado Scale]]) and no deaths occurred.<ref name=\"torro.org.uk\"/>\n\nSouthern England between the Isle of Wight and Beachy Head has been recognised as a 'hotspot' for tornadoes and waterspouts.<ref name=doe72>{{Cite book|last=Doe|first=Robert K.|title=Extreme Weather: Forty Years of the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|year=2016|isbn=978-1-118-95109-5|pages=72\u201374}}</ref>\nThe area (known as 'The Isle of Wight and South Coast Anomaly') has seen significant activity and is thought to be due to the shedding of  vortices,  downwind of the Isle of Wight, under certain weather conditions.<ref name=doe72/>\n\n==Climate history==\nThe climate of the United Kingdom has not always been the way it is today. During some periods it was much warmer and in others it was much colder. The [[last glacial period]] was a period of extreme cold weather that lasted for tens of thousands of years and ended about 10,000 years ago. During this period the temperature was so low that much of the surrounding ocean froze and a great [[ice sheet]] extended over all of the United Kingdom except the south of [[England]] (connected to mainland Europe via the dry English Channel) and southern coastal areas of [[Wales]].\n\nThe cold period from the 16th to the mid-19th centuries is known as the [[Little Ice Age]].\n\nThe temperature records in England are continuous back to the mid 17th century. The [[Central England temperature]] (CET) record is the oldest in the world, and is a compound source of cross-correlated records from several locations in central England. Precipitation records date back to the eighteenth century and the modern [[England and Wales Precipitation]] series begins in 1766.\n\nA detailed narrative account of the weather of every year from 1913 to 1942, with photographs of plants taken on the same day in each of those years, may be found in Willis (1944).<ref>Willis, J. H., (1944) ''Weatherwise'', London, George Allen and Unwin.</ref>\n\nAs with many parts of the world, over the last century the United Kingdom has reported a warming trend in temperatures. While some of this may be due to a recovery from the cooler period of climate mid 20th century (particularly the 1960s) the last 20 years has nonetheless seen an unprecedented level of warm weather. In July 2019, [[BBC]] reported that records from the [[Met Office]] show that the 10 warmest years in the UK have occurred since 2002, with 2014 being the warmest. In the same period, the coolest year has been 2010; however, this still only ranks 22nd on the overall list of coolest years on record.<ref>{{Cite

The name refers to its historic position as \"[[bank (geography)|The East Bank]]\" of the [[Huangpu River]], which flows through central Shanghai, although it is now administered as the '''Pudong New Area''', a [[new areas|state-level new area]] which extends all the way to the [[East China Sea]].\n\nThe traditional area of Pudong is now home to the [[Lujiazui|Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone]] and the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] and many of Shanghai's best-known buildings, such as the [[Oriental Pearl Tower]], the [[Jin Mao Tower]], the [[Shanghai World Financial Center]], and the [[Shanghai Tower]]. These modern skyscrapers directly face [[Puxi]]'s historic [[The Bund (Shanghai)|Bund]], a remnant of former [[concessions in China|foreign concessions]] in China. The rest of the new area includes the [[Port of Shanghai]], the [[Shanghai Expo Park|Shanghai Expo]] and [[Century Park (Shanghai)|Century Park]], [[Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park]], [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]], the [[Jiuduansha Wetland Nature Reserve]], [[Nanhui New City]], and the [[Shanghai Disney Resort]].\n\n==History==\n''Pudong''&mdash;literally \"The East Bank of the Huangpu River\"&mdash;originally referred only to the less-developed land across from Shanghai's [[Old City of Shanghai|Old City]] and [[Shanghai International Settlement|foreign concessions]]. The area was mainly farmland and only slowly developed, with warehouses and wharfs near the shore administered by the districts of [[Puxi]] on the west bank: [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], and [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]]. Pudong was originally established as a county in 1958 until 1961 which the county was split among [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]], [[Wusong District|Wusong]] and [[Chuansha County]]. In October 1, 1992 the original area of Pudong County and Chuansha County merged and established Pudong New Area.\n\nIn 1993, the Chinese government set up a [[special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]] in Chuansha, creating the Pudong New Area. The western tip of the Pudong district was designated as the [[Lujiazui|Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone]] and has become a financial hub of modern China. Several landmark buildings were constructed, including the Oriental Pearl Tower, and the [[skyscraper|supertall]] Jin Mao Building ({{convert|420.5|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Shanghai World Financial Center ({{convert|494|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and Shanghai Tower ({{convert|632|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the world's first trio of adjacent supertall skyscrapers. These buildings&mdash;all along Century Avenue and visible from the historic Bund&mdash;now form the most common [[skyline]] of Shanghai.\n\nOn May 6, 2009, it was disclosed that the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] had approved the proposal to merge [[Nanhui District]] with Pudong and comprise the majority of eastern Shanghai. In 2010, Pudong was host to the main venues of the [[Shanghai Expo]], whose grounds now form a [[Shanghai Expo Park|public park]].\n\nPudong New Area consist of the original Pudong County (northeastern portion of Shanghai County), [[Chuansha County]], and [[Nanhui District|Nanhui County]].\n\n==Government==\n[[District (China)|Districts]] of the [[direct-administered municipalities of China|Direct-Controlled Municipality]] of [[Shanghai]] are administratively on the same level as [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]]. However, the government of Pudong has a status equivalent to that of a [[sub-provincial division|sub-provincial city]], which is a half-level above a prefecture-level city. This is due to Pudong's size and importance as the financial hub of China. The Pudong Communist Party Secretary is the top office of the district, followed by the district governor of Pudong.  The Pudong party chief is customarily also a member of the Shanghai [[Party Standing Committee]].\n\nOn April 27, 2015, the People's Government of Pudong New Area is working with China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone Administrative Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150428/43646093_0.shtml |script-title=zh:\u4e0a\u6d77\u81ea\u8d38\u533a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u59274\u500d \u5c06\u4e0e\u6d66\u4e1c\u65b0\u533a\u5408\u7f72\u529e\u516c |date=April 27, 2015|accessdate =April 27, 2015|publisher=People's Daily}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nPudong literally means \"East Bank\".

[[Shanghai]] located east of the [[Huangpu River]] across from the historic city center of Shanghai in [[Puxi]]. The name refers to its historic position as \"[[bank (geography)|The East Bank]]\" of the [[Huangpu River]], which flows through central Shanghai, although it is now administered as the '''Pudong New Area''', a [[new areas|state-level new area]] which extends all the way to the [[East China Sea]].\n\nThe traditional area of Pudong is now home to the [[Lujiazui|Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone]] and the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] and many of Shanghai's best-known buildings, such as the [[Oriental Pearl Tower]], the [[Jin Mao Tower]], the [[Shanghai World Financial Center]], and the [[Shanghai Tower]]. These modern skyscrapers directly face [[Puxi]]'s historic [[The Bund (Shanghai)|Bund]], a remnant of former [[concessions in China|foreign concessions]] in China. The rest of the new area includes the [[Port of Shanghai]], the [[Shanghai Expo Park|Shanghai Expo]] and [[Century Park (Shanghai)|Century Park]], [[Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park]], [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]], the [[Jiuduansha Wetland Nature Reserve]], [[Nanhui New City]], and the [[Shanghai Disney Resort]].\n\n==History==\n''Pudong''&mdash;literally \"The East Bank of the Huangpu River\"&mdash;originally referred only to the less-developed land across from Shanghai's [[Old City of Shanghai|Old City]] and [[Shanghai International Settlement|foreign concessions]]. The area was mainly farmland and only slowly developed, with warehouses and wharfs near the shore administered by the districts of [[Puxi]] on the west bank: [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], and [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]]. Pudong was originally established as a county in 1958 until 1961 which the county was split among [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]], [[Wusong District|Wusong]] and [[Chuansha County]]. In October 1, 1992 the original area of Pudong County and Chuansha County merged and established Pudong New Area.\n\nIn 1993, the Chinese government set up a [[Special Economic Zone]] in Chuansha, creating the Pudong New Area. The western tip of the Pudong district was designated as the [[Lujiazui|Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone]] and has become a financial hub of modern China.  Several landmark buildings were constructed, including the Oriental Pearl Tower, and the [[supertall]] Jin Mao Building ({{convert|420.5|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Shanghai World Financial Center ({{convert|494|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and Shanghai Tower ({{convert|632|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the world's first trio of adjacent supertall skyscrapers. These buildings&mdash;all along Century Avenue and visible from the historic Bund&mdash;now form the most common [[skyline]] of Shanghai.\n\nOn May 6, 2009, it was disclosed that the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] had approved the proposal to merge [[Nanhui District]] with Pudong and comprise the majority of eastern Shanghai. In 2010, Pudong was host to the main venues of the [[Shanghai Expo]], whose grounds now form a [[Shanghai Expo Park|public park]].\n\nPudong New Area consist of the original Pudong County (northeastern portion of Shanghai County), [[Chuansha County]], and [[Nanhui District|Nanhui County]].\n\n==Government==\n[[District (China)|Districts]] of the [[direct-administered municipalities of China|Direct-Controlled Municipality]] of [[Shanghai]] are administratively on the same level as [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]]. However, the government of Pudong has a status equivalent to that of a [[sub-provincial division|sub-provincial city]], which is a half-level above a prefecture-level city. This is due to Pudong's size and importance as the financial hub of China. The Pudong Communist Party Secretary is the top office of the district, followed by the district governor of Pudong.  The Pudong party chief is customarily also a member of the Shanghai [[Party Standing Committee]].\n\nOn April 27, 2015, the People's Government of Pudong New Area is working with China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone Administrative Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150428/43646093_0.shtml |script-title=zh:\u4e0a\u6d77\u81ea\u8d38\u533a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u59274\u500d \u5c06\u4e0e\u6d66\u4e1c\u65b0\u533a\u5408\u7f72\u529e\u516c |date=April 27, 2015|accessdate =April 27, 2015|publisher=People's Daily}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nPudong literally means \"East Bank\".

An extension brought the line further east, where it serves the [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|airport]]. Other lines, namely Lines [[Line 4, Shanghai Metro|4]], [[Line 6, Shanghai Metro|6]], [[Line 7, Shanghai Metro|7]], [[Line 8, Shanghai Metro|8]], [[Line 9, Shanghai Metro|9]], [[Line 11, Shanghai Metro|11]], [[Line 12, Shanghai Metro|12]], [[Line 13, Shanghai Metro|13]] and [[Line 16, Shanghai Metro|16]] also have sections that serve parts of Pudong. A [[Shanghai Maglev Train|magnetic levitation train]] began operating in 2004, moving passengers between the airport and Longyang Road Metro station.\n[[Image:Huangpu River-The Bund.JPG|thumb|Ships on the Huangpu River with Pudong in view]]\n\nPudong is connected to [[Puxi]] by several tunnels and four major [[bridge]]s. The first of these bridges were the [[Nanpu Bridge]] (1991) and the [[Yangpu Bridge]] (1993).  The [[Xupu Bridge]] opened in 1996. The latest of these is [[Lupu Bridge]], which is the world's second longest [[arch bridge]] and was completed in 2002. Currently there are five tunnels that link the two sides, Dapu Rd. Tunnel, the first tunnel across the Huangpu River, Yan'an Rd. Tunnel, running east\u2013west, and Dalian Rd. Tunnel, running north\u2013south, [[Fuxing Rd.]] Tunnel, complementing the Yan'an Rd. Tunnel, Waihuan Tunnel, one part of Shanghai Outer Ring Express. Two new tunnels linking [[Lujiazui]] to [[Puxi]] are under construction.\n\nRoads in Pudong have no particular longitudinal or latitudinal orientation. Major thoroughfares Pudong Avenue, Zhangyang Road and Yanggao Road run east\u2013west until [[Yangpu Bridge]] before turning gradually to become north\u2013south. Century Avenue crosses all three major roads and extends from [[Lujiazui]] to Century Park. Yanggao Road extends south to the A20, Shanghai's outer Ring road, which runs east\u2013west from [[Xupu Bridge]] and then north\u2013south beginning at the interchange near Renxi Village, when the east\u2013west expressway turns into Yingbin Avenue, headed for Pudong International Airport.\n\n===Metro===\nPudong is currently served by ten metro lines and one tram line operated by [[Shanghai Metro]] and one maglev line operated by [[Shanghai Maglev Train]] and one suburban line operated by [[China Railway]]:\n\n*{{Rail color box|system=SHM|line=2|inline=yes}} -
