He [[news presenter|anchored]] a nightly newscast and occasionally ventured to far-flung locations to report on national and international stories, taking with him his own [[Bell and Howell]] movie camera with which he shot his own news footage. With him on KNXT's newscasts in that time were three other Los Angeles television stalwarts, anchor and reporter [[Bill Stout]], weather forecaster [[Bill Keene]] and sports reporter [[Gil Stratton]] (who at the time also doubled as a radio, television and movie actor).\n\n===KTLA Channel 5===\nRoberts left KNXT in 1959 and joined Los Angeles station [[KTLA]] Channel 5 as news director and primary anchor, along with news producer/director Julian Macdonald, virtually remaking that independent station's news operation. The newscast Roberts and Macdonald oversaw included such respected figures as Stout (who followed Roberts to KTLA in 1960), sports reporter and former football star [[Tom Harmon]], and veteran reporter [[Stan Chambers]] (who retired on August 11, 2010 on his 87th birthday, marking 63 years as a reporter at KTLA). Roberts' signature conclusion to the early news broadcast was \"I bid you a pleasant evening\"; for the late news it was \"I bid you goodnight.\"\n\n===\"The Big News\"===\nIn 1966, Roberts returned to KNXT, joining the station's highly esteemed 6 p.m. \"The Big News\" broadcast and its late-night companion \"The Eleven O'Clock Report.\" Roberts joined a staff that included anchor [[Jerry Dunphy]], [[Maury Green]], [[Ralph Story]], Keene, and Stratton. Roberts contributed news and feature reports and anchored the weekend newscasts. Early in 1974 he once again left KNXT for KTLA and took over the station's hour-long 10 p.m. newscasts. After two years Roberts decided to step back from nightly television news and left KTLA; after a hiatus he joined then-[[PBS]] member television station [[KCET]], contributing feature reports and commentaries. His long tenure in Los Angeles comprised reports and travels ranging from offbeat local stories to the war in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. According to the book Helter Skelter, the young son of a neighbor of Roberts found what turned out to be the .22 Buntline revolver wielded by Manson Family member Tex Watson the night of actress Sharon Tate's and her houseguests' murders, and it was turned over to the police.  As details of the crime came out in the weeks that followed, the boy's father made several calls to the police, suggesting that the missing murder weapon was the same broken, long-barreled gun his son had found.

He [[news presenter|anchored]] a nightly newscast and occasionally ventured to far-flung locations to report on national and international stories, taking with him his own [[Bell and Howell]] movie camera with which he shot his own news footage. With him on KNXT's newscasts in that time were three other Los Angeles television stalwarts, anchor and reporter [[Bill Stout]], weather forecaster [[Bill Keene]] and sports reporter [[Gil Stratton]] (who at the time also doubled as a radio, television and movie actor).\n\n===KTLA Channel 5===\nRoberts left KNXT in 1959 and joined Los Angeles station [[KTLA]] Channel 5 as news director and primary anchor, along with news producer/director Julian Macdonald, virtually remaking that independent station's news operation. The newscast Roberts and Macdonald oversaw included such respected figures as Stout (who followed Roberts to KTLA in 1960), sports reporter and former football star [[Tom Harmon]], and veteran reporter [[Stan Chambers]] (who retired on August 11, 2010 on his 87th birthday, marking 63 years as a reporter at KTLA). Roberts' signature conclusion to the early news broadcast was \"I bid you a pleasant evening\"; for the late news it was \"I bid you goodnight.\"\n\n===\"The Big News\"===\nIn 1966, Roberts returned to KNXT, joining the station's highly-esteemed 6 p.m. \"The Big News\" broadcast and its late-night companion \"The Eleven O'Clock Report.\" Roberts joined a staff that included anchor [[Jerry Dunphy]], [[Maury Green]], [[Ralph Story]], Keene, and Stratton. Roberts contributed news and feature reports and anchored the weekend newscasts. Early in 1974 he once again left KNXT for KTLA and took over the station's hour-long 10 p.m. newscasts. After two years Roberts decided to step back from nightly television news and left KTLA; after a hiatus he joined then-[[PBS]] member television station [[KCET]], contributing feature reports and commentaries. His long tenure in Los Angeles comprised reports and travels ranging from offbeat local stories to the war in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. According to the book Helter Skelter, the young son of a neighbor of Roberts found what turned out to be the .22 Buntline revolver wielded by Manson Family member Tex Watson the night of actress Sharon Tate's and her houseguests' murders, and it was turned over to the police.  As details of the crime came out in the weeks that followed, the boy's father made several calls to the police, suggesting that the missing murder weapon was the same broken, long-barreled gun his son had found. Finally, fed up with months of being ignored by the LAPD, he asked Clete Roberts to intervene in December 1969. The book does not say whether the call from Roberts finally did the trick.\n\n===Acting career===\nRoberts also carried his polish and expertise onto the \"silver screen\" and television as well, most notably in select episodes of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', in which he played himself, a war correspondent.\n\nRoberts appeared as himself in the lengthy introduction to the crime syndicate expose film ''[[The Phenix City Story]]'' in 1955.

During the pre-revolutionary period, these ideas are apparent in such things as the creation of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], the [[Acad\u00e9mie de peinture et de sculpture]] and other state-sponsored institutions of artistic production, and through the cultural policies of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]].\n\nThe modern post of Minister of Culture was created by [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1959 and the first officeholders was the writer [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]]. Malraux was responsible for realising the goals of the ''droit \u00e0 la culture'' (\"right to culture\"), an idea which had been incorporated in the [[Constitution of France]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948), by democratising access to culture, while also achieving the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] aim of elevating the \"grandeur\" (\"greatness\") of post-war France.  To this end, he created numerous regional cultural centres throughout France and actively sponsored the arts. Malraux's artistic tastes included the modern arts and the avant-garde, but on the whole he remained conservative.\n\n[[File:Archives nationales Pierrefitte 1.jpg|thumb|left|One of France's six National Archives sites operated by the Ministry of Culture, in [[Pierrefitte-sur-Seine]]]]\nUnder President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] the Minister of Culture was [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]] who showed himself to be far more open to popular cultural production, including [[jazz]], [[rock and roll]], [[rap music]], [[graffiti]], [[cartoon]]s, [[comic books]], [[fashion]] and [[food]]. His famous phrase \"\u00e9conomie et culture, m\u00eame combat\" (\"economy and culture: it's the same fight\") is representative of his commitment to cultural democracy and to active national sponsorship and participation in cultural production. In addition to the creation of the ''[[F\u00eate de la Musique]]'' and overseeing the French Revolution bicentennial (1989), he was in charge of the [[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|massive architectural program]] of the [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] years (the so-called ''Grands travaux'' or \"Great Works\") that gave permission for the building of the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale]], the new [[Louvre]], the [[Arab World Institute]], the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], the [[Op\u00e9ra-Bastille]], the \"[[Grande Arche]]\" of [[La D\u00e9fense]] (the Parisian business quarter), the new seat of the [[French Ministry for the Economy and Finance]], the [[Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre]], and the [[Cit\u00e9 des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] and [[Cit\u00e9 de la Musique]], both in the [[Parc de la Villette]].\n\nThe Ministry of [[Jacques Toubon]] was notable for a number of laws (the \"[[Toubon Law]]s\") enacted for the preservation of the [[French language]], both in advertisements (all ads must include a French translation of foreign words) and on the radio (35% of songs on French radio stations must be in French), ostensibly in reaction to the presence of English.\n{{-}}\n==Ministros de Cultura==\nLas siguientes personas fueron nombradas Ministro de Cultura de Francia:\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* Febrero 1959: [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]]\n* Junio 1969: [[Edmond Michelet]]\n* Octubre 1970: [[Andr\u00e9 Bettencourt]]\n* Enero 1971: {{ill|Jacques Duhamel|fr}}\n* Abril 1973: [[Maurice Druon]]\n* Marzo 1974: [[Alain Peyrefitte]]\n* Junio 1974: {{ill|Michel Guy|fr}}\n* Agosto 1976: [[Fran\u00e7oise Giroud]]\n* Marzo 1977: [[Michel d'Ornano]]\n* Abril 1978: [[Jean-Philippe Lecat]]\n* Marzo 1981: [[Michel d'Ornano]]\n* Mayo 1981: [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]]\n* Marzo 1986: [[Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9otard]]\n* Mayo 1988: [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]]\n* Marzo 1993: [[Jacques Toubon]]\n* Mayo 1995: [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]]\n* Junio 1997: [[Catherine Trautmann]]\n* Marzo 2000: [[Catherine Tasca]]\n* Mayo 2002: [[Jean-Jacques Aillagon]]\n* Marzo 2004: [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]]\n* Mayo 2007: [[Christine Albanel]]\n* Junio 2009: [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand]]\n* Mayo 2012: [[Aur\u00e9lie Filippetti]]\n* Agosto 2014: [[Fleur Pellerin]]\n* Febrero 2016: [[Audrey Azoulay]]\n* Mayo 2017: [[Fran\u00e7oise Nyssen]]\n* Octubre 2018: [[Franck Riester]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Names of the Ministry of Culture==\nSince the French constitution does not identify specific ministers (merely speaking of \"the minister in charge of\" this or that), each government may label each ministry as they wish, or even have a broader ministry in charge of several governmental sectors.

France|national museums]] and the ''[[Monument historique|monuments historiques]]''. Its goal is to maintain the French identity through the promotion and protection of the arts (visual, plastic, theatrical, musical, dance, architectural, literary, televisual and cinematographic) on national soil and abroad. Its budget is mainly dedicated to the management of the [[Archives Nationales (France)|Archives Nationales]] (six national sites and hundred decentralised storage facilities) and the regional ''Maisons de la culture'' (culture centres).\n\nIts main office is in the [[Palais-Royal]] in the [[1st arrondissement of Paris]] on the [[Rue de Valois]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/ |title=Accueil |website=Minist\u00e8re de la Culture |language=fr |access-date=7 May 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511161520/http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/ |archive-date=11 May 2016 |quote=Nous contacter: 3, rue de Valois, 75001 Paris}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=PA00085993 |title=Monuments historiques: \u00e9difice / site: Domaine national du Palais-Royal (ancien Palais Cardinal), comprenant Conseil d'Etat, Conseil Constitutionnel, Minist\u00e8re de la Culture, th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise |website=[[Base M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]] |language=fr |access-date=7 May 2016 |quote=place du Palais-Royal ; 1 \u00e0 7 rue de Valois ; 2 \u00e0 8 rue de Montpensier ; place Colette.}}</ref> It is headed by the Minister of Culture, a cabinet member.

During the pre-revolutionary period, these ideas are apparent in such things as the creation of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], the [[Acad\u00e9mie de peinture et de sculpture]] and other state-sponsored institutions of artistic production, and through the cultural policies of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]].\n\nThe modern post of Minister of Culture was created by [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1959 and the first officeholders was the writer [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]]. Malraux was responsible for realising the goals of the ''droit \u00e0 la culture'' (\"right to culture\"), an idea which had been incorporated in the [[Constitution of France]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948), by democratising access to culture, while also achieving the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] aim of elevating the \"grandeur\" (\"greatness\") of post-war France.  To this end, he created numerous regional cultural centres throughout France and actively sponsored the arts. Malraux's artistic tastes included the modern arts and the avant-garde, but on the whole he remained conservative.\n\n[[File:Archives nationales Pierrefitte 1.jpg|thumb|left|One of France's six National Archives sites operated by the Ministry of Culture, in [[Pierrefitte-sur-Seine]]]]\nUnder President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] the Minister of Culture was [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]] who showed himself to be far more open to popular cultural production, including [[jazz]], [[rock and roll]], [[rap music]], [[graffiti]], [[cartoon]]s, [[comic books]], [[fashion]] and [[food]]. His famous phrase \"\u00e9conomie et culture, m\u00eame combat\" (\"economy and culture: it's the same fight\") is representative of his commitment to cultural democracy and to active national sponsorship and participation in cultural production. In addition to the creation of the ''[[F\u00eate de la Musique]]'' and overseeing the French Revolution bicentennial (1989), he was in charge of the [[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|massive architectural program]] of the [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] years (the so-called ''Grands travaux'' or \"Great Works\") that gave permission for the building of the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale]], the new [[Louvre]], the [[Arab World Institute]], the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], the [[Op\u00e9ra-Bastille]], the \"[[Grande Arche]]\" of [[La D\u00e9fense]] (the Parisian business quarter), the new seat of the [[French Ministry for the Economy and Finance]], the [[Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre]], and the [[Cit\u00e9 des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] and [[Cit\u00e9 de la Musique]], both in the [[Parc de la Villette]].\n\nThe Ministry of [[Jacques Toubon]] was notable for a number of laws (the \"[[Toubon Law]]s\") enacted for the preservation of the [[French language]], both in advertisements (all ads must include a French translation of foreign words) and on the radio (35% of songs on French radio stations must be in French), ostensibly in reaction to the presence of English.\n{{-}}\n==Ministers of Culture==\nThe following people were appointed as Minister of Culture of France:\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* February 1959: [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]]\n* June 1969: [[Edmond Michelet]]\n* October 1970: [[Andr\u00e9 Bettencourt]]\n* January 1971: {{ill|Jacques Duhamel|fr}}\n* April 1973: [[Maurice Druon]]\n* March 1974: [[Alain Peyrefitte]]\n* June 1974: {{ill|Michel Guy|fr}}\n* August 1976: [[Fran\u00e7oise Giroud]]\n* March 1977: [[Michel d'Ornano]]\n* April 1978: [[Jean-Philippe Lecat]]\n* March 1981: [[Michel d'Ornano]]\n* May 1981: [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]]\n* March 1986: [[Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9otard]]\n* May 1988: [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]]\n* March 1993: [[Jacques Toubon]]\n* May 1995: [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]]\n* June 1997: [[Catherine Trautmann]]\n* March 2000: [[Catherine Tasca]]\n* May 2002: [[Jean-Jacques Aillagon]]\n* March 2004: [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]]\n* May 2007: [[Christine Albanel]]\n* June 2009: [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand]]\n* May 2012: [[Aur\u00e9lie Filippetti]]\n* August 2014: [[Fleur Pellerin]]\n* February 2016: [[Audrey Azoulay]]\n* May 2017: [[Fran\u00e7oise Nyssen]]\n* October 2018: [[Franck Riester]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Names of the Ministry of Culture==\nSince the French constitution does not identify specific ministers (merely speaking of \"the minister in charge of\" this or that), each government may label each ministry as they wish, or even have a broader ministry in charge of several governmental sectors.

The present day old village dates mainly back to the 18th century and was a planned community, replacing earlier buildings. Historically, the economy was based around agriculture and, in common with a number of other Renfrewshire villages, cotton weaving. The old village was designated as a [[conservation area]] in 1968.\n\nFrom the middle of the 20th century, a larger area of residential settlement expanded the village into nearby areas such as [[Craigends]], removing the open country between Houston and Crosslee. These additions to the village have expanded its population considerably, changing its character chiefly to a [[dormitory settlement]] for nearby [[Glasgow]] and [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] with a largely service-based economy. \n\n==History==\n===Toponymy===\n[[Image:Houston House in Renfrewshire, Scotland.jpg|thumb|Houston House.]]\nHouston was originally known as Kilpeter. In the mid 12th century, the fee of Kilpeter was granted by [[Baldwin of Biggar|Baldwin of Biggar, Sheriff of Lanark]], to [[Hugh de Paduinan|Hugh of Pettinain]]. From Hugh, the lands eventually became known as Houston (meaning \"Hugh's ''tun'' or manor\").<ref>{{citation |last=Barrow |first=Geoffrey Wallis Steuart |author-link=G. W. S.

The former parish church in the nearby hamlet of [[St Fillan's Kirk, Seat and Well|Killellan]] was known as the [[St Fillan's Kirk, Seat and Well|Church of St Fillan]], which the name of the settlement derives.

Following the reunification of the United Free Church and the established Church of Scotland in 1929, the West Kirk existed as a second Church of Scotland congregation in the village until a fire destroyed much of the building in March 1941.

The present day old village dates mainly back to the 18th century and was a planned community, replacing earlier buildings. Historically, the economy was based around agriculture and, in common with a number of other Renfrewshire villages, cotton weaving. The old village was designated as a [[conservation area]] in 1968.\n\nFrom the middle of the 20th century, a larger area of residential settlement expanded the village into nearby areas such as [[Craigends]], removing the open country between Houston and Crosslee. These additions to the village have expanded its population considerably, changing its character chiefly to a [[dormitory settlement]] for nearby [[Glasgow]] and [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] with a largely service-based economy. \n\n==History==\n===Toponymy===\n[[Image:Houston House in Renfrewshire, Scotland.jpg|thumb|Houston House.]]\nHouston was originally known as Kilpeter. In the mid 12th century, the fee of Kilpeter was granted by [[Baldwin of Biggar|Baldwin of Biggar, Sheriff of Lanark]], to [[Hugh de Paduinan|Hugh of Pettinain]].

Following the reunification of the United Free Church and the established Church of Scotland in 1929, the West Kirk existed as a second Church of Scotland congregation in the village until a fire destroyed much of the building in March 1941. The lack of a building caused the two congregations to again worship in the same parish church. The West Kirk building was fully restored by 1953, taking its place as the church hall it remains to this day.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.houstonscotland.org.uk/kirk/our%20church.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106124721/http://www.houstonscotland.org.uk/kirk/our%20church.htm |archive-date=6 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHouston and Kilellan Kirk is currently the second richest church in Scotland, after Paisley Cathedral.\n\nSt. Fillan's [[Roman Catholic Church]], also on Main Street, was established in 1841 on a property called \"Four Windings\" now remembered in the name of an adjacent street.\n\n==Economy==\nChiefly serving a [[dormitory town|commuter village]], Houston's chief local economic activity is [[agriculture]], with some [[tertiary sector]] businesses such as local shops and public houses serving residents and visitors. There are a number of these shops and pubs in the old village, and a number of shops located on the boundary with [[Crosslee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townfirst1158.html|title=Crosslee from The Gazetteer for Scotland|website=www.scottish-places.info}}</ref>\n\n===Public houses and brewing===\nThe parish supports a number of [[public house]]s, with two located in the historic village centre: the Fox and Hounds on South Street and the Houston Inn on North Street, established in 1779 and 1784 respectively. Until 2010, a third, the Cross Keys Inn, lay on Main Street, with a name derived from the crossed keys symbol of [[St Peter]] as a reference to the village's original name, Kilpeter. It has since operated as a restaurant. A further restaurant and public house, the River Inn, lies in Crosslee and was formerly the Crosslee Inn and the Pine Trees.<ref name=\"communitywebsite\" />\n\nThe village hosts a regular beer festival/<ref>http://www.list.co.uk/event/178765-beer-festival-fox-and-hounds-houston/</ref> A [[microbrewery]], the [[Houston Brewing Company]], also formerly operated from a building adjacent to the Fox and Hounds.<ref name=\"communitywebsite\" />\n\n==Culture and community==\nThere are a number of community organisations and events that take place in the village. The village's main park, Houston Public Park, is adjacent to the old village, with others at South Street and Ardgryffe Park among the more modern housing developments.\n\nHouston Public Park is the venue for the village's annual agricultural show, taking place in the summer and organised by the Houston and Killellan Agricultural Society. Another significant local event is the Kirk Carnival, organised by the parish church and focused around the church hall and Carrick Centre on Main Street, which involves a parade and a number of stalls and entertainments and including the local primary schools.\n\nIn 1992, Strathgryffe Tennis Squash and Fitness Club, opened with support from the [[Lawn Tennis Association]] and the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] Sports Fund, is also located in the village.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.strathgryffe.net/club/club-history|title=Club History|website=Strathgryffe Tennis, Squash and Fitness Club}}</ref> An [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] club, the Kilmacolm and Kilallan Riding Club is based on the boundary of the parish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kilmacolmridingclub.org.uk/|title=Kilmacolm and Kilallan Riding Club|website=www.kilmacolmridingclub.org.uk}}</ref> A [[foxhunting|foxhunt]], the Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire Foxhounds, has operated from kennels in the village since 1850.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lanarkandrenfrew.com/|title=Lanarkshire & Renfrewshire Foxhounds|website=lanarkandrenfrew.com}}</ref>\n\nThe village also hosts a [[lawn bowls]] club, the John G.

As stated above, Gryffe High School is the non-denominational secondary for the village whereas St. Benedict's High School is the Roman Catholic secondary serving Houston along with Bridge of Weir (which St. Fillan's also serves).\n\nThe 'old schoolhouse' at the north end of Main Street in the old village centre has been converted into self-catering accommodation and the former school at the south end of Main Street now exists as a community building known as the Carrick Centre.\n\n==Public services==\nThe [[territorial police force]] covering Houston is the [[Police Service of Scotland]]. It is part of the Renfrewshire and Inverclyde division and the Renfrew area Command. The nearest local [[police station]] is at [[Johnstone]].<ref>https://www.scotland.police.uk/your-community/renfrewshire-and-inverclyde/renfrew/houston-crosslee-and-linwood/</ref> There was a police station and police house in the village opened in the mid-1940s, which was closed in 2001.<ref>http://www.lands-tribunal-scotland.org.uk/decisions/LTS.LO.2000.42.html</ref> \n\nFor judicial purposes, the Houston forms part of the [[sheriffdom]] of North Strathclyde and [[prosecutor|public prosecutions]] are directed by the [[Procurator Fiscal]] for [[Argyll and Clyde]].

Despite its modest length of {{convert|74|km|mi}}, it is the fourth largest river in [[Europe]] in terms of average [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] (after the [[Volga]], the [[Danube]] and the [[Rhine]]).<ref name=\"Neva2\" />\n\nThe Neva is the only river flowing from Lake Ladoga. It flows through the city of [[Saint Petersburg]], three smaller towns of [[Shlisselburg]], [[Kirovsk, Leningrad Oblast|Kirovsk]] and [[Otradnoye, Kirovsky District, Leningrad Oblast|Otradnoye]], and dozens of settlements. The river is navigable throughout and is part of the [[Volga\u2013Baltic Waterway]] and [[White Sea \u2013 Baltic Canal]]. It is a site of numerous major historical events, including the [[Battle of the Neva]] in 1240 which gave [[Alexander Nevsky]] his name, the founding of Saint Petersburg in 1703, and the [[Siege of Leningrad]] by the German army during [[World War II]]. The Neva river played a vital role in trade between [[Byzantium]] and [[Scandinavia]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe area of the Neva river was originally inhabited by [[Baltic Finns|Finnic people]].  The word ''neva'' is widely spread in [[Finnic languages]] with similar meanings. In [[Finnish language|Finnish]] (''neva'') it means [[poor fen]], in [[Karelian language|Karelian]] (''neva'') watercourse and in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] (''n\u00f5va'') waterway.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/37709596/Muinaiskarjalan_uralilainen_tausta|title=Muinaiskarjalan uralilainen tausta|last=Kallio|first=Petri|date=|website=Academia|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nIt has also been argued that the name derives from the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] adjective ''new\u0101'' which means new. The river began to flow around 1350 BC. However, the place names of the area don't support any Indo-European influence in the area before Scandinavian traders and Slavs started to enter the region in the 8th century CE.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Description ==\n\n===History of the delta===\nIn the [[Paleozoic]], 300\u2013400 million years ago, the entire territory of the modern delta of the Neva River was covered by a sea. Modern relief was formed as a result of glacier activity. Its retreat formed the [[Littorina Sea]], the water level of which was some {{convert|7|to|9|m|ft|0}} higher than the present level of the Baltic Sea. Then, the [[Tosna River]] was flowing in the modern bed of the Neva, from east to west into the Litorinal Sea. In the north of the [[Karelian Isthmus]], the Littorina Sea united by a wide strait with [[Lake Ladoga]]. The [[Mga River]] then flowed to the east, into Lake Ladoga, near the modern source of the Neva River; the Mga then was separated from the basin of the Tosna.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LElrclnl0C8C&pg=PA217|pages=217\u2013219|title=Climate development and history of the North Atlantic realm|author=Wefer, Gerold |publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=3-540-43201-9}}</ref>\n\nNear the modern Lake Ladoga, land rose faster, and a closed reservoir was formed. Its water level began to rise, eventually flooded the valley of Mga and broke into the valley of the river Tosna. The Ivanovo [[rapid]]s of the modern Neva were created in the breakthrough area. So about 2000 BC the Neva was created with its tributaries Tosna and Mga. According to some newer data, it happened at 1410\u20131250 BC making the Neva a rather young river.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Shoreline displacement of Lake Ladoga \u2014 new data from Kilpolansaari|last1=Saarnisto |journal=Hydrobiologia|first1=Matti\n|year=1996|last2=Gr\u00f6nlund|first2=Tuulikki|author8=Saarnisto, Matti and Gr\u00f6nlund, Tuulikki\n|volume= 322| issue = 1\u20133|pages=205\u2013215|doi= 10.1007/BF00031829}}</ref> The valley of Neva is formed by glacial and post-glacial sediments and it did not change much over the past 2500 years.<ref name=Geogr>{{cite book|author = Darinskii, A.V.|title = \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430|trans-title=Geography of Leningrad|publisher = Lenizdat|year = 1982|pages = 12\u201318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KuRdPAAACAAJ}}</ref> The delta of Neva was formed at that time, which is actually pseudodelta, as it was formed not by accumulation of river material but by plunging into the past sediments.<ref name=SPBe>St. Petersburg: Encyclopedia. \u2013 Moscow: Russian Political Encyclopedia. 2006 {{ISBN|5-8110-0107-X}}</ref>\n\n===Topography and hydrography===\nThe Neva flows out of Lake Ladoga near [[Shlisselburg]], flows through the [[Neva Lowland]] and discharges into the [[Baltic Sea]] in the [[Gulf of Finland]].

At the end of the 19th century, the delta of Neva consisted of 48 rivers and canals and 101 islands. The most significant distributaries of the delta are listed in the table. Before construction of the [[Obvodny Canal]], the left tributary of that area was Volkovka River; its part at the confluence is now called Monastyrka River.

The trams ran at the speed of {{convert|20|km/h|mph}} and could carry 20 passengers per carriage. The carriages were converted from the used [[horsecar]]s.

I. \"Bridges of St. petersburg\", Glagol, 2002.</ref> During World War II, from 8 September 1941 to 27 January 1944 Leningrad was in the devastating [[Siege of Leningrad|German Siege]]. On 30 August 1941, the German army captured Mga and came to Neva. On 8 September Germans captured Shlisselburg and cut all land communications and waterways to St. Petersburg (then Leningrad). The siege was partly relieved in January 1943, and ended on 27 January 1944.<ref name=hist1 />\n\nA river station was built above the Volodarsky Bridge in 1970 which could accept 10 large ships at a time. Wastewater treatment plants were built in Krasnoselsk in 1978, on the Belyi Island in 1979\u201383, and in [[Olgino]] in 1987\u201394. The South-West Wastewater Treatment Plant was constructed in 2003\u201305.<ref name = SPBe/>\n\n== Commercial use ==\nNeva has very few shoals and its banks are steep, making the river suited for navigation. Utkino Backwaters were constructed in the late 19th century to park unused ships. Neva is part of the major [[Volga\u2013Baltic Waterway]] and [[White Sea \u2013 Baltic Canal]], however it has relatively low transport capacity because of its width, depth and bridges. Neva is available for vessels with capacity below 5,000 tonnes. Major transported goods include timber from [[Arkhangelsk Oblast|Arkhangelsk]] and [[Vologda Oblast|Vologda]]; [[apatite]], [[granite]] and [[diabase]] from [[Kola Peninsula]]; [[cast iron]] and [[steel]] from [[Cherepovets]]; coal from [[Donetsk]] and [[Kuznetsk]]; [[pyrite]] from Ural; [[potassium chloride]] from [[Solikamsk]]; oil from [[Volga]] region.

After liftoff, the crew noticed that the nose gear undercarriage did not retract, and the [[Air traffic control|ground control]] diverted the flight to [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] ([[Pulkovo Airport|LED]]) because of [[fog]] at Tallinn. While circling above St. Petersburg at the altitude of at {{convert|1650|ft|m}}, under unclear circumstances (lack of fuel was one of the factors), both engines stalled.

It flows through the city of [[Saint Petersburg]], three smaller towns of [[Shlisselburg]], [[Kirovsk, Leningrad Oblast|Kirovsk]] and [[Otradnoye, Kirovsky District, Leningrad Oblast|Otradnoye]], and dozens of settlements. The river is navigable throughout and is part of the [[Volga\u2013Baltic Waterway]] and [[White Sea \u2013 Baltic Canal]]. It is a site of numerous major historical events, including the [[Battle of the Neva]] in 1240 which gave [[Alexander Nevsky]] his name, the founding of Saint Petersburg in 1703, and the [[Siege of Leningrad]] by the German army during [[World War II]]. The Neva river played a vital role in trade between [[Byzantium]] and [[Scandinavia]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe area of the Neva river was originally inhabited by [[Baltic Finns|Finnic people]].  The word ''neva'' is widely spread in [[Finnic languages]] with similar meanings. In [[Finnish language|Finnish]] (''neva'') it means [[poor fen]], in [[Karelian language|Karelian]] (''neva'') watercourse and in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] (''n\u00f5va'') waterway.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/37709596/Muinaiskarjalan_uralilainen_tausta|title=Muinaiskarjalan uralilainen tausta|last=Kallio|first=Petri|date=|website=Academia|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nIt has also been argued that the name derives from the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] adjective ''new\u0101'' which means new. The river began to flow around 1350 BC. However, the place names of the area don't support any Indo-European influence in the area before Scandinavian traders and Slavs started to enter the region in the 8th century CE.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Description ==\n\n===History of the delta===\nIn the [[Paleozoic]], 300\u2013400 million years ago, the entire territory of the modern delta of the Neva River was covered by a sea. Modern relief was formed as a result of glacier activity. Its retreat formed the [[Littorina Sea]], the water level of which was some {{convert|7|to|9|m|ft|0}} higher than the present level of the Baltic Sea. Then, the [[Tosna River]] was flowing in the modern bed of the Neva, from east to west into the Litorinal Sea. In the north of the [[Karelian Isthmus]], the Littorina Sea united by a wide strait with [[Lake Ladoga]]. The [[Mga River]] then flowed to the east, into Lake Ladoga, near the modern source of the Neva River; the Mga then was separated from the basin of the Tosna.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LElrclnl0C8C&pg=PA217|pages=217\u2013219|title=Climate development and history of the North Atlantic realm|author=Wefer, Gerold |publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=3-540-43201-9}}</ref>\n\nNear the modern Lake Ladoga, land rose faster, and a closed reservoir was formed. Its water level began to rise, eventually flooded the valley of Mga and broke into the valley of the river Tosna. The Ivanovo [[rapid]]s of the modern Neva were created in the breakthrough area. So about 2000 BC the Neva was created with its tributaries Tosna and Mga.

The service was highly successful and ran without major accidents except for a few failures in the top electrical wires. The trams ran at the speed of {{convert|20|km/h|mph}} and could carry 20 passengers per carriage. The carriages were converted from the used [[horsecar]]s.

That church was constructed in 1708 and it burned down in 1963.

The plane took off from [[Tallinn]]-\u00dclemiste Airport ([[Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport|TLL]]) at 08:55 on 21 August 1963 with 45 passengers and seven crew on board and was scheduled to land at [[Moscow]]-Vnukovo ([[Vnukovo International Airport|VKO]]). After liftoff, the crew noticed that the nose gear undercarriage did not retract, and the [[Air traffic control|ground control]] diverted the flight to [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] ([[Pulkovo Airport|LED]]) because of [[fog]] at Tallinn. While circling above St. Petersburg at the altitude of at {{convert|1650|ft|m}}, under unclear circumstances (lack of fuel was one of the factors), both engines stalled. The crew performed emergency landing on the Neva River, barely missing some of its bridges and an 1898-built steam [[tugboat]]. The tugboat rushed to the plane and towed it to the shore. No casualties were sustained at any stage. The plane captain was first fired from job but then restored and awarded with the [[Order of the Red Star]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.aviaport.ru/digest/2009/01/16/164980.html|publisher = AviaPort|title = A320 splashed on the Hudson, as the Tu-124 on the Neva River in 1963}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19630821-2|publisher = Aviation Safety Network|title = Accident description}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nevariver.ru/airplane.php|publisher = Petrovsky Courier, No 41 (211) |date=2 November 1998|title =The plane could land on the city but landed... on Neva}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Neva|short=x}}\n* {{Cite NIE|wstitle=Neva|short=x}}\n* [http://nevariver.ru Neva River] {{in lang|ru}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://parovoz.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=3743|title=Links to a collection of \"ice-tram\" service photos|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130131093432/http://parovoz.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=3743|archivedate=31 January 2013|language=ru}}\n\n{{Saint Petersburg}}\n{{Rivers and channels of Saint Petersburg}}\n{{Hydrofoil boats lines of Saint Petersburg}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Neva basin| ]]\n[[Category:Ingria]]\n[[Category:Karelian Isthmus]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Saint Petersburg]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Leningrad Oblast]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBasin, tributaries and distributaries", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neva_River"}

Like its predecessors, the Picchio was a conventional low-wing [[cantilever]] monoplane of exceptionally clean lines, with retractable tricycle undercarriage.

Only a few examples were built, however, and the design lay dormant until revived by an [[Austria]]n company, [[HOAC]] in the mid 1990s.
