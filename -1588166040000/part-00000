It tells the story of [[Nausica\u00e4 (character)|Nausica\u00e4]], a princess of a small kingdom on a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Earth]] with a toxic [[ecosystem|ecological system]], who becomes involved in a war between kingdoms while an [[environmental disaster]] threatens humankind.\n\nPrior to creating ''Nausica\u00e4'', Miyazaki had worked as an animator for [[Toei Animation]], [[Nippon Animation]] and [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] (TMS), the latter for whom he had directed his feature film debut, ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro|Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' (1979). After working on an aborted adaptation of [[Richard Corben]]'s ''Rowlf'' for TMS and the publishing firm [[Tokuma Shoten]], he agreed to create a manga series for Tokuma's monthly magazine ''[[Animage]]'', initially on the condition that it would not be adapted into a film. ''Nausica\u00e4'' was influenced by the Japanese folk tale ''[[The Lady who Loved Insects|The Princess who Loved Insects]]'', [[Nausicaa|a similarly-named character]] from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', the [[Minamata Bay|Minamata Bay mercury pollution]], and various works of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] by Western writers, among other sources. The manga was serialized intermittently in ''Animage'' from February 1982 to March 1994 and the individual chapters were collected and published by Tokuma Shoten in seven ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. It was serialized with an English translation in [[North America]] by [[Viz Media]] from 1988 to 1996 as a series of 27 [[comic book]] issues and has been published in collected form multiple times.\n\nSince its initial serialization, ''Nausica\u00e4'' has become a commercial success, particularly in Japan, where at least 11 million copies have been sold. The manga and the 1984 [[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|film adaptation]], written and directed by Miyazaki following the serialization of the manga's first sixteen chapters,<!-- 'Following the serialization of' is probably more appropriate that 'based on', since this source (http://www.utdallas.edu/research/spacesciences/hairston/nausicaamanga_film.html - from the University of Dallas) covers the areas of the manga the film adapts and since this source (http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html) shows that chapters 15 and 16 are the opening chapters of vol. 3, none of which was adapted for the film. --> received universal acclaim from critics and scholars for its characters, themes, and art. The manga and film versions of ''Nausica\u00e4'' are also credited for the foundation of [[Studio Ghibli]], the animation studio for which Miyazaki created several of his most recognized works.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting===\n{{See also|List of Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind characters}}\n\nThe story is set in the future at the closing of the [[Ceramic engineering|ceramic]] era, 1,000 years after the Seven Days of Fire, a cataclysmic global war, in which [[Industrialisation|industrial civilization]] self-destructed. Although humanity survived, the land surface of the Earth is still heavily polluted and the seas have become poisonous. Most of the world is covered by the Sea of Corruption, a toxic forest of fungal life and plants which is steadily encroaching on the remaining open land. It is protected by large mutant insects, including the massive Ohmu. Humanity clings to survival in the polluted lands beyond the forest, periodically engaging in bouts of internecine fighting for the scarce resources that remain. The ability for space travel has been lost but the earth-bound remnants of humanity can still use [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]] and [[powered aircraft]] for exploration, transportation and warfare. (Powered [[Vehicles|land vehicles]] are mostly nonexistent, with humanity regressed to dependence on [[Working animal|riding animals and beasts-of-burden]].)\n\n===Plot===\n[[File:Nausicaa2p121.jpg|thumb|The Dorok prophecy: \"''And that one shall come to you garbed in raiment of blue and descending upon a field of gold''...\"]]\n\n[[Nausica\u00e4 (character)|Nausica\u00e4]] is the princess of the Valley of the Wind, a state on the periphery of what was once known as Eftal, a kingdom destroyed by the Sea of Corruption, a poisonous forest, 300 years ago. An inquisitive young woman, she explores the territories surrounding the Valley on a jet-powered glider, and studies the Sea of Corruption.\n\nThe valley of the wind lead by the aging and sick king Jhil, is subordinate to the Vai emperor of Tourumekia. Most cities, tribes, villages, valleys etc. of the new earth are in some form of another part of either Dorok or Torumekian command: Two massive nations that have been at odds or at war for thousand(s) of years. Torumekia has a large army, and does not appear to be religious. The Doroks are sectarian, with military and strategic higher ranks assigned to priests. Doroks and Torumekian people usually dislike each other, but there are various exceptions.\n\nThe Vai emperor has four children: 3 unnamed sons, and his daughter Kushana. The royal family is notorious for internal conflicts, backstabbing schemes, and desperate attempts to obtain or hold on to the power of the throne. The Doroks have a more stable government composed of the emperor, his brother, and the \u201cCouncil of Elders\u201d.\n\n==== Chapter 1: The Valley of the Wind. ====\nNausica\u00e4 is studying plants deep within the sea of corruption. While lying in peace and tranquillity on a dead ohmu shell, she suddenly has brief visions and flashes saying \u201c''Hate''\u201d or \u201c''Death''\u201d. Someone is being chased by a raging ohmu, and Nausica\u00e4 comes to the rescue by calming it down. Her teacher and good friend Yupa had accidentally angered an ohmu after an incident with a baby fox-squirrel. Nausica\u00e4 adopts the squirrel and names it \u201cTeto\u201d. They return to the valley of the wind.\n\nNausica\u00e4 tries out a gunship with her uncle Mito. She once again has similar visions and flashes of anger and hatred, and almost crashes the ship. In the distance they notice a refugee ship covered with insects. Their attempt to save it fails, and all the passagers die. In the wreckage and fire they meet and hear the dying words of Raspel: The princess of Torumekia-subsidiary Pejite. Apparently torumekian imperial guards working for the emperor invaded and burned down their entire village. Raspel hands Nausica\u00e4 a special stone that\u2019s she wants delivered to her brother, Asbel. The imperial guards are very interested in this stone, as they soon after show up with wormhandlers and examine and loot through all the dead bodies. They suspect the people of the valley of the wind are in possession of the stone, and immediately organize an attack.\n\nNausica\u00e4 has just returned to the valley when the torumekian troops attack. The imperial guards send in worm handlers to search for the stone, but Nausica\u00e4 stops them. Disgusted and angered by their attack and the realization that they disrespectfully looted the dead bodies, she engages in on-ground combat with one of the soldiers. Nausica\u00e4 impales the soldier from the neck with a knife, and - despite the fact that he is already dead - tries to stab him in the heart with a sword too. Yupa stops her (by taking a hit himself) and convinces both sides to stop fighting.\n\nThe Vai emperor declares war on the doroks. Kushana is quite dissatisfied with her role, and suspects a backstabbing scheme by her brothers. They have been assigned to work with large armies and big important battles with lots of loot and slaves, while she has been assigned but a few men to \u201cthreaten the enemy flank\u201d near the poisonous sea of corruption. She is also tasked with finding the stone. Her newly chosen staff officer / watchdog is Kurotowa.\n\nKushana forces a set of peripheries of Torumekia, including The Valley Of The Wind, to help in the war. They are to meet first by air. Aging king Jhil sends Nausica\u00e4, Mito, and a few others from the valley. In the air, many ships are suddenly shot down by a small gunship controlled by Aspel of Pejite. There are great losses, and many soldiers die. Aspel\u2019s plane is finally shot down, but he lands in the forest and survives. Nausica\u00e4 and her men crash by a lake in the sea of corruption. Ohmu appear from below the sea, and tell Nausica\u00e4 that they are ready, and that the northern forest has no use for them anymore. Soon after, a bunch of angry insects appear, all flying towards some destination in the south. Nausica\u00e4 follows the insects and accidentally meets Aspel. Surrounded by insects, they both cling to survival. In the end they are saved by the ohmu, who appear fond of Nausica\u00e4. When the insects leave, they are left in the deepest depths of the sea of corruption, but find, to their surprise, a clean and beautiful non-poisonous area with breathable air. Nausica\u00e4 hides the stone, Aspel fixes the wind glider, and they both take off\n\n==== Chapter 2: The Sea Of Corruption. ====\nNausica\u00e4 and Asbel are nearly shot down by a group of doroks known as the Mani tribe. Their leader comes out, and tells them to stop the fighting. He \u201cinvites\u201d Nausica\u00e4 and Asbel on board. Here they meet Ketcha, a girl from the Mani tribe. She tells Nausica\u00e4 to chat with their leader. Much of the Mani tribe and its land has been destroyed by Torumekian troops. The leader and his tribe are currently headed for the encampment were Kushana landed her forces to fix airships and prepare weapons and tactics. They were told this info has come from someone within the royal family. Nausica\u00e4 and Asbel realize that the Mani tribe\u2019s true plan is to raid the Torumekian-allied periphery lands (including the Valley of Wind) to replace their own lost land, and attempt to convince the Mani by force to do otherwise. The attempt fails, and Nausica\u00e4 flees from the ship, saved by Uncle Mito on a search mission.\n\nAt Kushana\u2019s camp, a battle suddenly breaks lose. Doroks soldiers had prepared a trap, and are now attacking the Torumekian and Periphery troops and airplanes. On top of this, the Doroks have a plan: A small \"flying jar\" squad is flying a baby Ohmu towards Kushana's encampent to attract a giant herd of massive angry Ohmu. The technique is successful, and all of Kushana\u2019s forces are brutally wiped out. Only her, Kurotowa, and a few loyal soldiers escape on a single airship. A warning from Nausicaa and Mito enabled all the Periphery troops and airships to narrowly escape (the chaos of the battle led to the Torumekians forces getting the warning too late). Nausicaa sees the baby Ohmu, and tries to stop the Dorok flying jar from advancing any further. She shoots down the flying jar that carries the Ohmu, and it crashes on a small sandbank in a lake of acid. The Ohmu is severely injured but alive, and although Nausica\u00e4 attempts to kill it using the jar's machine gun, she cannot bring herself to do so.  The herd appears, and the baby Ohmu tries to cross the acid lake in an attempt to reach the herd. Nausica\u00e4 tries to prevent this, and her foot is burned by the acid. The baby Ohmu stops and heals Nausica\u00e4 using its golden feelers, while its blood dyes her dress a deep, pure blue. The herd of Ohmu, still waiting on the banks, nearly commit mass-suicide in their attempt to walk through the lake of acid and retrieve the baby. Kushana's airship flies overhead, Nausica\u00e4 asks her to carry the Ohmu in exchange for all the information she knows about the Doroks and the stone. Kushana orders her ship to carry the Ohmu to the herd, and Nausica\u00e4 is celebrated and taken up by the Ohmu in their feelers so that it looks like she is standing in \u201ca field of gold\u201d.\n\nYupa is out searching for the secrets of the Sea of Corruption - it\u2019s cause, and how it works. He secretly breaks into a ship controlled by wormhandlers, and is taken to an underground wormhandler enclave that doubles as a Dorok base. The Mani tribe survivors, their priest, Asbel (in disguise as a Mani tribe warrior), and Ketcha are all there. A priest from the council of elders is disappointed with the Mani tribe leader, who has criticized the decision to use Ohmu in battle. Yupa, hiding in the pipes, hears the entire conversation, but is caught by a wormhandler. In the process of evading capture, he is caught entering a room where baby Ohmu are artificially bred in tanks. The wormhandlers attempt to capture Yupa under the orders of Dorok priests, but are unsuccessful. Right before a force of wormhandlers swarms Yupa, a \"Mani tribe warrior\" challenges him to a duel, a match which is approved of by the Dorok priests as a way for the Mani tribe to prove their loyalty. The Mani tribe warrior reveals himself to be Asbel, and shatters the incubation tank with his sword. He and Yupa flee immediately, and meet up with the Mani tribe priest on the surface. Just as the holy emperors brother Miralupa Kulubaluka appears, Yupa, Asbel, Ketcha, and the Mani tribe leader flee. In a telepathic confrontation with the emperor's brother the Mani leader states that the \"blue-clad one\" is real, and that the Dorok leaders are destroying the world, and will trigger a Daikaisho. The Mani tribe leader is stabbed to death by the imperial guards while Miralupa's astral projection searches for Nausica\u00e4, who is currently on Kushana's airship. The Mani tribe leader uses the last of his life force to protect Nausica\u00e4 from the astral projection, though Miralupa is still able to glimpse her face. During the commotion, Yupa, Asbel and Ketcha escape using the wormhandler airship that Yupa snuck in on.\n\n==== Chapter 3: The Dorok War. ====\nYupa, Aspel and Ketcha are caught in a thunderstorm, and struck down by a Dorok airship. The doroks send down wormhandlers to loot their bodies and make sure they are dead. Just as they\u2019re about to cut off Yupa\u2019s hand, they are met by \u201cThe forest people\u201d: An intelligent autonomous indigenous group of people that live in harmony with the sea of corruption through specialised equipment. The forest people are well-respected and worshipped by wormhandlers, so they let the bodies go. Yupa, Aspel and Ketcha have all survived the fall (somehow), and are taken in and treated by the forest people. The forest people explain that the purpose of the sea of corruption is actually to ''clean'' the poisonous air and soil. The trees and plants collect the miasma, and eventually break down to sand and dust.\n\nNausica\u00e4 has joined up with Kushana and Kurutowa. The ohmu told her they went south, and she wants to see why - might as well join up with Kushana and Kurotowa while she has the opportunity. Kushana\u2019s assigned mission has failed (she has neither confronted the enemy flank nor collected the stone) so she attempts to join up with the Third Army unit - which she trained herself. Kurutowa instead is hesitant and that she should join one of her brothers' armies, or goes directly to the Vai emperor, but Kushana sees through his scheme. Her mission was impossible to win, as she was only supposed to collect the stone and be executed for failing to do the rest. Kurutowa confesses that he was indeed sent to kill Kushana (by the Vai emperor himself), but that they might be able to strike up a deal nonetheless: He is to be killed in some way or another due to his entanglement in the royal family, but were he to follow Kushana he might still survive. She, on the other hand, can benefit from a pragmatic and talented staff officer, one that isn\u2019t merely loyal, but thinks for himself as well. Kushana accepts the deal, and they head off to search for the third army.\n\nOn the way, they fly across a small village being bombed by torumekian ships. Kushana and Kurotowa, being at this point enemies of the state, shoot down the ships, and look for the nearest well to get some water. Nausica\u00e4 flies down and explores the city: It appears all the villagers are dead not because of bombings or weapons, but from Miasma and poisoning, even though the village is more than 100 metres away from the nearest forest. Nausica\u00e4 tries to warn the other\u2019s not to go down the well, but a few soldiers end up severely poisoned. On top of the miasma there\u2019s a large insect down there, and it attempts to eat Nausica\u00e4. When it tastes the ohmu blood on her clothes though, it spits her out.\n\nThey fly away from the village. Flying close to the ground so as not to be spotted, they follow a few dorok ships that might lead them to the third army. Nausica\u00e4 notices the miasma getting very strong, and they enter a forest made only of poisonous fungi, so dense with miasma even the insects are dying. Kurotowa reluctantly raises the altitude and flies up above the clouds to the dorok ships. Just barely avoiding getting hit, they fly down again through the miasma and reach a hectic battlefield. A torumekian-occupied Dorok city is surrounded and being invaded by the dorok army, and a sector of Kushana\u2019s third army is trying to defend it. They are failing miserably, as they have been specialised and trained in quick offensives: Not defence. Kushana raises her flag and sword, and watches till the very end. Some of the soldiers had been poisoned by miasma out on the battlefield: The doroks seemed to be in control of it.\n\nKushana decides the next best move is to help another sector of her third army. They're protecting another occupied dorok castle/fort under dorok siege. The assigned leader of the defence is lazy and ruthless; He attempts to fly away with spoils and loot from the war, leaving his soldiers to die, but is stopped by Kushana. The torumekians have captured a bunch of dorok slaves, which Nausica\u00e4 naturally finds disgusting and morally corrupt. She demands that Kushana release the slaves, which is accepted on the condition that Nausica\u00e4 will ride with her on the battlefield.\n\nThe plan is to destroy heavy dorok artillery in a quick offensive. The attack is successful, but the escape will require killing a good many dorok troops. Nausica\u00e4 splits up from the group, attempting a more pacifist solution. It work\u2019s decently well, but a few soldiers must sacrifice their lives as human shields to prevent her from getting shot. Her riding-animal is shot by Charuka of the dorok council of elders. She is almost captured, but the animal regains a last burst of energy (because magic) and Nausica\u00e4 escapes.\n\nThe slaves are released. Charuka rides to the castle to thank the torumekians for their unexpected but kind deed.\n\n==== Chapter 4: Catastrophe. ====\nThough the attack was effective, the torumekian castle is still surrounded by dorok troops. All the airships that could save the soldiers have been taken away by Kushana's brothers to leave her own loyal soldiers to be sacrificed. Kushana and Kurotowa fly on a mission with some soldiers to the south to capture aircraft. They spot a single insect flying south in the same direction - a scout. It\u2019s shot down by an arrogant aristocrat on another aircraft, who drunkenly made a bet for money. In reaction to the death of the scout, a swarm of similar insects appear and attack and subsequently destroy the craft. To escape the angry swarm, Kurotowa pulls up and raises altitude. Above the clouds they find massive swarms of forest insects, all flying south. It\u2019s a mass migration, another so-called \u201cdaikaisho\u201d has begun.\n\nKushana uses the chaos of the upcoming insect attack in her mission to steal the needed aircraft - but her and Kurotowa's plane is rammed by the armoured corvette of one of Kushana\u2019s brothers. Her brother tries to kill them both. Kurotowa is badly injured from the ramming, but manages to buy some time. He and Kushana avoid getting shot just as the insects appear. The armoured corvette takes off, and in the distance is destroyed by insects. Kushana\u2019s most hated brother - the one that poisoned her mother - is dead. She had wanted to kill him her whole life, and suddenly he is just killed by insects, with no involvement from her.\n\nThe insects have really appeared now, and the camp is a bloodbath. Soldiers are killed, eaten, decapitated and crushed by insects everywhere. Hiding as well as they can in the trenches, it is a mere miracle that Kushana and badly-injured Kurotowa survive. A few of Kushana\u2019s best men are holding onto her in fear as the gruesome scene unfolds. Without noticing it herself, she sings a lullaby. She looks at a massive, angry insect directly in the eyes, but it does not choose to kill her.\n\nBack to Nausica\u00e4. She did not choose to follow Kushana, and instead went south on her glider alone - that ''was'' her original goal after all.&nbsp; She discovers a small, empty village. It was once an autonomous independent village, but was later destroyed by the dorok. In the village she meets Chikuku: A small kid with psychic abilities. Inside a religious building she is also greeted by a very old monk in meditation. He tells her that the daikaisho has begun, and that he is excited for \u201cthe great purification\u201d to begin. Nausica\u00e4 disagrees with the notion that everyone and everything has to die for a \u201cnew world to be reborn\u201d but does not get much time to further consider this topic, as a giant insect suddenly falls to the ground. Nausica\u00e4 and Chikuku take to the sky to see what\u2019s up, and notice in the near distance a huge swarm of insects attacking a dorok airship infested with some kind of mold.\n\nThe dorok emperor\u2019s brother Miralupa is on ship, and so is Charuka. Miralupa has issued an order to breed strong mold for use as biological weapons, but the mold has grown explosively and gotten out of hand. Nausica\u00e4 flies to the deck of the ship and is attacked by Miralupa. He has heard of a \u201cblue-clad one\u201d in prophecies and is obsessed with finding and killing Nausica\u00e4. His \u201cphysical form\u201d is old and weak, so he attempts to attack using psychic abilities. He fails. Charuka plans to burn down the ship to hopefully destroy the mold. Nausica\u00e4 helps him out, and they just barely manage to escape the explosive growth of the mold. Unfortunately, burning the ship did not destroy all the mold: A good bit survived and falls to the ground. As it falls to the ground, it forms an umbrella. It shows further signs of intelligence and sentience when scientists approach it by air, and it actively targets and attacks them. On the ground it feeds off dead insect bodies and grows drastically in size. It is shown to be attracted to other molds, as it at one point reaches over 100 metres up to get in contact with a small piece of mold on the scientist\u2019s ship.\n\n==== Chapter 5: Daikaisho. ====\nChapter 5 starts in Shuwa, the dorok capital city. The holy emperor, Namulith, looks at the god-warrior they have found and bred. It has grown, and he is satisfied, but for a moment afraid of it. On the ground, the council of elders, whom Namulith dislikes, accuses him of breaking many rules.\n\nNamulith is about a thousand years old - has gone through many painful transformative surgeries. His brother Miralupa is also very old, but has not chosen to change his body. Instead he has had operations and baths in painful chemicals to keep his original body living. Despite his role as emperor, Namulith has been in the shadows of his brother due to his lack of psychic abilities. Due to the incident with the airplane carrying mold, Miralupa\u2019s body was injured. He must undergo an operation, and Namulith decides to kill him by adding a poisonous substance to his chemical bath. Namulith says he no longer cares for the fate of the dorok people, but that he simply wants to watch the world burn, like it did in the seven days of fire.\n\nBack to Yupa, Ketcha, Aspel, and Mito. They are gathering information and trying to figure out what the torumekians are up to. Everything is chaos among the torumekians. They are in full retreat, looting every dorok village and city they go through of food and everything, and killing or taking every dorok as slaves, and leaving behind \"scorched Earth\". Yupa and the lot fly through this hellscape and come across many areas of doroks and torumekians killed by insects and the spreading forest. Eventually they find Kushana, her soldiers, and Kurotowa. After the insect attack and ensuing miasma, Kushana and her soldiers tried surviving in a crashed aircraft for about a month. They were just about to lose hope as another aircraft finally came. Aspel of Pejite is furious at Kushana for burning down his city, but they eventually decide to join up.\n\nNausica\u00e4, Charuka, and Chikuku are trying to get a hold of the mold. Fire and explosives do not seem to work. There are about three molds, and after mapping out their movements they conclude that they are trying to merge. To much the dismay of Charuka, Nausica\u00e4 and Chikuku use their psychic powers to impersonate a heavenly spirit, as to convince a city of doroks to find the highest hill they know if they want to survive. Nausica\u00e4 also explores an area in sky filled with insect\u2019s circle around some point. At the bottom she finds a dying, fully matured ohmu. She realizes that the insects and the ohmu are not trying to ''attack'' the mold: Rather they are trying to help it. The ohmu are using themselves as food for the mold, and the insects are trying to eat away it\u2019s pain. Nausica\u00e4 realizing just how hopeless the situation is, rides her glider to a hill where she sits alone. Some forest people come and give her a better mask, but she is intent on dying with the ohmu. She finds a heard of ohmu stampeding towards the merging point, jumps onto one, and reaches the middle. She lays on an ohmu as it is being covered with mold. Just before it dies, it opens its mouth and swallows Nausica\u00e4. Inside the ohmu, she is covered with a kind of protective bubble that makes her unconscious.\n\nYupa, Kushana, and the lot reach the city-fortress where she left the remnants of her third army. Now deserted thanks to an earlier evacuation warning from Nausicca, they find only a small group of her soldiers now dead along with a dead heedra, an artificial kind of creature designed for war. Its body regenerates, and it can only be killed by a destroying the brain. Living heedra show up and capture Kushana. Yupa jumps onto the plane that captures Kushana, and the others just barely survive taking off on their own aircraft.\n\nNamulith ordered the capture of Kushana. Not before long she regains consciousness, takes out all the guards, and battles up to the bridge to Namulith. He shows her that the soldiers of her third army are still alive. Namulith will save the soldiers on the condition that they marry, seize Torumekia together, and form a joint dorok-torumekian empire. &nbsp;\n\n==== Chapter 6: The Place Dreamed ====\nThe merging point of the molds grows to a massive forest in the matter of hours. Floods of wormhandler tribes migrate from their hidden villages; these longtime \"outcasts\" and \"untouchables\" now following the spreading forest and taking claim over the devastated Dorok territories.\n\nA forest person helps out Charuka and Chikuku find Nausica\u00e4. She\u2019s unconscious, and they need to find a place she can recover. On their way, they come across Namulith\u2019s ship. While Miralupa is dead, his spirit is somehow still alive, and he immediately rushes to possess Nausicaa. Charuka finds a place for Nausica\u00e4 to rest. Chikuku and the forest person stay, but Charuka returns to Namulith and the dorok army, aware it may be his death.\n\nWe see a dream vision Nausica\u00e4 has while unconscious. She is followed by Miralupa, personified as a scared, old, naked, ugly man. She enters a forest, and meets Selm, a forest person she has \u201cspiritually\u201d met previously in the story. He helps them both ride an ohmu to cross a river. The old man is very happy suddenly. They reach the end of the river and arrive at a petrified sea of corruption that has turned to dust. Beyond it, the nature is beautiful and clean. Grass grows, and there are birds, trees, etc. Miralupa's spirit is now at peace and remains in this clean \"afterlife\" paradise. Nausica\u00e4 wakes up.\n\nMito, Aspel, Ketcha, and Kurotowa accidentally land on the same mountain where Nausica\u00e4 is and all meet up. Forest people also show up, and followed by wormhandlers (all tribes of them now believing Nausica\u00e4 to be a messiah and saviour). They all decide to hurry to the spot where Namulith will marry Kushana. Charuka is being stoned until death on Namulith's orders, but Nausica\u00e4 manages to save him. Dorok ships arrive carrying the god-warrior, and Nausica\u00e4 orders Mito's aircraft to shoot them down. Namulith, Kushana (and secretly Yupa) take off on his ship with the god-warrior atop. Nausica\u00e4 lands on the deck and confronts Namulith. They battle, and he and his heedra gain the upper hand. Since Nausica\u00e4 still has the stone, the warrior awakens and saves her, calling her \"mother\". &nbsp;\n\nNamulith's artificially grown body is injured beyond repair by the god-warrior. He is tired of living and that \u201cThings always turn out as the master of the crypt says they will\u201d.\n\n==== Chapter 7: The Crypt. ====\nKushana, Nausica\u00e4, and the Vai emperor are all intent on going to the crypts of Shuwa. Nausica\u00e4 flies away with the god warrior, has an encounter with Kushana\u2019s brothers (who are also going to the crypt). Teto dies from the radioactive light emitted by the god warrior (whom Nausica\u00e4 has named \u201cOhma\u201d). She asks Ohma to land so she can bury the body. Sick from the light herself, she is offered help by a strange man.\n\nHe takes her to some nearby ruins that look normal and destroyed from the air, but beautifully covered with beautiful foliage and are alive with wonderful animals on the inside. Nausica\u00e4 meet\u2019s Kushana\u2019s brothers in there too. Even though everything seems nice, Nausica\u00e4 realizes something must be wrong, especially upon seeing heedra farmers. She attempts to escape, but is stopped by the man who led her in. She calls upon the spiritual help of Selm, and the man/creature tries to persuade Nausica\u00e4 to stay in the garden. Saving the world is impossible he says: Humans have ''adapted'' to the Poisonous air, and when the sea of corruption eventually cleans the soil, humans as we know them won\u2019t be able to live in the new world of clean air and nature. They\u2019ll cough up blood. He also mentions Namulith and Miralupa's father, the previous Dorok emperor, who centuries back had lived in this same garden and was once a young and hopeful man, intent on saving humanity and the world, and so seized the Dorok throne and made himself emperor. But over time he could not bear the weight of the whole world\u2019s problems and gradually became ruthless and evil.\n\nNausica\u00e4 leaves, and meet\u2019s up with Mito and a group of wormhandlers. She lies and tells them that after the sea of corruption cleans the earth, the world will be wonderful and easy.\n\nYupa, Ketcha, Charuka, Chikuku, Kushana, Kurotowa, the last third army soldiers, and floods of Dorok refugees have gathered on a mountain in the aftermath of Namulith's defeat and death. The Dorok tribes want revenge on the Torumekians and a new conflict is on the brink. Yupa sacrifices his life to protect Kushana and stop the conflict, in a scene that remind the Mani Tribe of what their own leader did to protect them.\n\nThe Vai emperor has already invaded Shuwa. With both emperors dead, it is an easy task. The real problem is entering the crypt itself, which is explosion and bullet proof, and shoots down all intruders with a laser-eye. Ohma has walked to Shuwa while Nausica\u00e4 was in the garden. He manages to shoot down the laser eye (with an explosion the size of an atom bomb) but destroys himself along with all of Shuwa and the Vai emperor's army in the process. The people inside the crypt come out to greet the Vai emperor. They are deliriously old from immortality technology. The Vai emperor walks inside, and Nausica\u00e4 with her tribe of wormhandlers follow shortly thereafter. Mito and Aspel have landed on top of the crypt: It seems to be an organism with regenerative abilities.\n\nNausica\u00e4 and the Vai emperor meet \u201cthe master of the crypt\u201d. ''It'' is a massive \"brain\" in the bottom of the crypt, covered with cryptic text. The people working in the crypt have been slowly deciphering the text for centuries. It contains all human knowledge and art from the old world. Throughout the years they have worked \u201csymbiotically\u201d with different powers: Protection in return for any technology the government might please. Nausica\u00e4 speaks with the Master, who takes the form of hundreds of scientists from the old world that worked to create it. The masters reengineered people to withstand the poisonous air and planned the sea of corruption. Having a power with access to advanced technology and biological tools of war would only speed up the process of destroying the old world so a new one could be reborn. The master says they have the tools to biologically change humans and have them stand the clean air again. Nausica\u00e4 disagrees with the notion that the old world must rot for a better one to appear; Especially since the master of the crypt itself will be in sole charge of creating a \u201cbetter\u201d world. While its intentions might have been pure once, over the course of 2000 years, it, like any other ruler, has been corrupted by power. The crypt thinks it can create a \u201cperfect\u201d world with no darkness, but that is impossible, thinks Nausica\u00e4. With the combined last powers of Ohma, a missile from Mito\u2019s ship, and Nausica\u00e4, the heart of the crypt is destroyed. The whole crypt falls apart, but Nausica\u00e4, the emperor and Aspel all manage to escape.\n\nNausicaa\u2019s friends and allies arrive, and everyone meet\u2019s up. The emperor is dying, and hands over the throne to Kushana. She rejects the offer. People all walk away from the crypt.<!--The country name is Torumekia, so this formulation is fine for identifying to whom they've become vassals.

That same year [[Pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] serialization started of his manga ''[[Sabaku no Tami|People of the Desert]]''. His manga adaptation of [[D\u014dbutsu Takarajima|''Animal Treasure Island'']] was serialized in 1971.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy |1y=1999|1p=219|2a1=Comic Box November 1|2y=1982|2p=111|3a1=Animage June 10|3y=1983|3pp=172,173}}\n\nAfter the December 1979 release of ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', Miyazaki, now at the [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] (TMS) subsidiary [[Telecom Animation Film]], began working on his ideas for an animated film adaptation of [[Richard Corben]]'s comic book ''Rowlf'' and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=249|2a1=Kan\u014d |2y=2007|2pp=37ff, 323}} Around that time Miyazaki was also approached for a series of magazine articles by the editorial staff of [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s ''[[Animage]]''. During subsequent conversations he showed his sketchbooks and talked about basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]] and Osamu Kameyama, at the time working as editors for ''Animage''. They saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Initially two projects were proposed to Tokuma Shoten, that are significant for the eventual creation of Nausica\u00e4: {{Nihongo |''Warring States Demon Castle'' | \u6226\u56fd\u9b54\u57ce | Sengoku ma-j\u014d }}, to be set in the [[Sengoku period]], and an aborted adaptation of Corben's ''Rowlf'', but they were rejected, on July 9, 1981. The proposals were rejected because the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga and because the rights for the adaptation of ''Rowlf'' could not be secured.{{sfnm|1a1=DVD Japan|1y=2003|2a1=DVD UK|2y=2005|3a1=Art|3y=1984|3p=8|4a1=Miyazaki|4y=1996|4p=146|5a1=Miyazaki|5y=2007|5p=146|6a1=Haraguchi|6y=1996|6p=35}}\n\nAn agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that it would never be made into a film.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=73|2a1=Saitani|2y=1995|2p=9}}{{efn|See in particular Miyazaki's answer to Saitani's question: \"Were you asked, from the beginning, to draw the comic with the intention of it becoming an animated work?\"{{sfnm|1a1=Saitani|1y=1995|1p=9}} }} Miyazaki stated in an interview, \"''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'' only really began to take shape once I agreed to serialize it.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1y=1996|1p=149|2a1=Miyazaki|2y=2007|2p=149}} In the December 1981 issue of ''Animage'', it was announced that a new manga series would start in the February 1982 issue of the magazine, despite the fact that Miyazaki had not completed the first episode.

Miyazaki mentions Nakao in the context of a question he is asked about the place ''Nausica\u00e4'' takes in the ''ecology boom'' and does so explaining his shift from a desert to a forest setting. Nakao's influence on his work has been noted by Shiro Yoshioka.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=5|2a1=Yoshioka|2y=2008|p=262}} Miyazaki has identified Tetsuji Fukushima's ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Sabaku no ma\u014d|ja|3=\u6c99\u6f20\u306e\u9b54\u738b}}'' {{nihongo|\u6c99\u6f20\u306e\u9b54\u738b|The Evil Lord of the Desert}}, a story he first read while still in primary school, as one of his earliest influences.

Ogata persuaded Miyazaki to continue.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitani|1y=1995|1p=9}} }} [[Frederik L. Schodt]] observed differences between Nausica\u00e4 and other Japanese manga. He has noted that it was serialized in the large [[Paper size#A series|A4 size]] of ''Animage'', much larger than the normal size for manga. Schodt has also observed that Miyazaki drew much of Nausica\u00e4 in pencil without inking, and that the page and panel layouts, as well as the heavy reliance on storytelling, are more reminiscent of French comics than of Japanese manga. In appearance and sensibilities, ''Nausica\u00e4'' reminds Schodt of the works of [[M\u0153bius]].{{sfnm|1a1=Schodt|1y=1996|1p=278}}\n\nTakekuma has noted stylistic changes in Miyazaki's artwork over the course of the series. He points out that, particularly in the first chapters, the panels are densely filled with background, which makes the main characters difficult to discern without paying close attention. According to Takekuma this may be partially explained by Miyazaki's use of pencil, without inking, for much of the series. Takekuma points out that by employing pencil Miyazaki does not give himself the option of much variation in his line. He notes that in the later chapters Miyazaki uses his line art to, literally, draw attention to individuals and that he more frequently separates them from the background. As a result there are more panels in which the main characters stand out vividly in the latter part of the manga.{{sfnm|1a1=Takekuma|1y=2008}}\n\nMiyazaki has stated in interviews that he frequently worked close to publication deadlines and that he was not always able to finish his monthly instalments for serialization in ''Animage''. On such occasions he sometimes created apologetic cartoons. These were printed in the magazine, instead of story panels, to explain to his readers why there were fewer pages that month or why the story was absent entirely. Miyazaki has indicated that he continued making improvements to the story prior to the publication of the ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes, in which chapters from the magazine were collected in book form.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=17}} Changes made throughout the story, before the release of each ''tank\u014dbon'' volume, range from subtle additions of shading to the insertion of entirely new pages. Miyazaki also redrew panels and sometimes the artwork was changed on whole pages. He made alterations to the text and changed the order in which panels appeared. The story as re-printed in the ''tank\u014dbon'' spans 7 volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages.<ref name=\"Ryan(Comparison)\">{{Cite web| title=Nausica\u00e4 Manga Comparison | url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/naucompare.html | last=Ryan | first= Scott | publisher=Nausicaa.net | accessdate=December 31, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMiyazaki has said that the lengthy creation process of the ''Nausica\u00e4'' manga, repeatedly tackling its themes as the story evolved over the years, not only changed the material but also affected his personal views on life and changed his political perspectives. He also noted that his continued struggle with the subject matter in the ongoing development of the Nausica\u00e4 manga allowed him to create different, lighter, films than he would have been able to make without Nausica\u00e4 providing an outlet for his more serious thoughts throughout the period of its creation.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=15\u201316}} Marc Hairston notes that, \u201cTellingly, Miyazaki\u2019s first film after finishing the ''Nausica\u00e4'' manga was ''[[Princess Mononoke|Mononoke Hime]]'', which examined many of the themes from the manga and is arguably the darkest film of his career.\u201d{{sfnm|1a1=Hairston|1y=2010|1p=177\u2013178}}\n\n===Localization===\n''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'' was initially translated into English by [[Toren Smith]] and Dana Lewis. Smith, who had written comics in the U.S. since 1982, wrote an article on [[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)#Warriors of the Wind|''Warriors of the Wind'']] (the heavily edited version of the film adaptation released in the U.S. in the 1980s) for the Japanese edition of [[Starlog]], in which he criticized what [[New World Pictures]] had done to Miyazaki's film. The article came to the attention of Miyazaki himself, who invited Smith to Studio Ghibli for a meeting. On Miyazaki's insistence, Smith's own company [[Studio Proteus]] was chosen as the producer of the English-language translation. Smith hired Dana Lewis to collaborate on the translation. Lewis was a professional translator in Japan who also wrote for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and had written cover stories for such science fiction magazines as ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'' and ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. Smith hired [[Tom Orzechowski]] for the lettering and retouching.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1995|1p=44-47}}\n\nStudio Proteus was responsible for the translation, the lettering, and the retouching of the artwork, which was flipped left-to-right to accommodate English readers. The original Japanese dialogue was re-lettered by hand, the original sound effects were replaced by English sound effects, and the artwork was retouched to accommodate the new sound effects. When Miyazaki resumed work on the manga following one of the interruptions, Viz chose another team, including [[Rachel Matt Thorn]] and Wayne Truman, to complete the series.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1995|1p=47}} The current seven-volume, English-language \"Editor's Choice\" edition is published in right-to-left reading order: while it retains the original translations, the lettering was done by Walden Wong.

She indicates that this was probably done inadvertently in the case of the manga translation, which retains animistic elements and contains [[pantheistic]] phrases, but may have been more deliberate in the translation of dialogue and narration for [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s release of the film. In the case of the manga she attributes this \"Christianizing\" to the limitations of the languages involved, particularly the absence of precise English equivalents for Japanese words and concepts such as ''[[kami]]'', ''[[oni]]'' and ''[[Wrathful deities|kishin]]'' and honorific titles such as ''[[Japanese honorifics#Sama|sama]]''. As another explanation, she offers that translators of both the manga and the film work from a [[Judeo-Christian]] background, in a language suffused with Judeo-Christian [[idiom]]s not found in Japanese, which they introduce to the text, and she indicates that the translators work for an audience more accustomed to, and with the expectation of, the Judeo-Christian religions' [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]], [[Conflict between good and evil|good versus evil]] [[worldview]] in fictional narratives. Ogihara-Schuck concludes that particularly the film translation erased animistic motifs completely but that the manga translations, \"by enveloping the text in a dualistic world view\", also implicitly reintroduced this dualistic, good versus evil, worldview, absent in the original Japanese language manga, which she presumes to have been a strategy to make the works more accessible to the American audience.{{sfnm|1a1=Ogihara-Schuck|1y=2010|1p=133\u2013146}}\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\nThe manga was serialized in [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s monthly ''[[Animage]]'' magazine between 1982 and 1994.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=442\u2013445}} The series initially ran from the February 1982 issue to the November 1982 issue when the first interruption occurred due to Miyazaki's work related trip to Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Animage October 10|1y=1982|1p=181}} Serialization resumed in the December issue and the series ran again until June 1983 when it went on hiatus again due to Miyazaki's work on the film adaptation of the series. Serialization of the manga resumed for the third time from the August 1984 issue but halted again in the May 1985 issue when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on ''[[Laputa]]''. Serialization resumed for the fourth time in the December 1986 issue and was halted again in June 1987 when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on the films ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''. The series resumed for the fifth time in the April 1990 issue and was halted in the May 1991 issue when Miyazaki worked on ''[[Porco Rosso]]''. The series resumed for the final time in the March 1993 issue. The final panel is dated January 28, 1994. The last chapter was released in the March 1994 issue of ''Animage''. By the end Miyazaki had created 59 chapters, of varying length, for publication in the magazine. In an interview, conducted shortly after serialization of the manga had ended, he noted that this amounts to approximately 5 years worth of material. He stated that he did not plan for the manga to run that long and that he wrote the story based on the idea that it could be stopped at any moment.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=9|2a1=Animage February 10|2y=1994|2p=204|3a1=Yom June 1|3y=1994|3p=3}}<ref name=\"chapter_guide\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html|title=Chapter guide | last=Ryan | first=Scott|work=Nausicaa.net | publisher=Team Ghiblink | accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe chapters were slightly modified and collected in seven ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes, in soft cover [[Paper size#Japanese B-series variant|B5 size]].<ref name=\"Ryan(Comparison)\"/> The first edition of volume one is dated September 25, 1982.

serialization of the manga was underway and the story had proven to be popular among its readers, ''Animage'' came back on their promise not to turn the manga into an animation project and approached Miyazaki to make a 15 minute Nausica\u00e4 film. Miyazaki declined. Instead he proposed a sixty-minute [[Original video animation|OVA]]. In a counter offer Tokuma agreed to sponsor a feature-length film for theatrical release.<ref name= \"Animerica(1993)\">{{cite journal |last=Oshiguchi | first=Takashi | title=The whimsy and wonder of Hayao Miyazaki | journal=[[Animerica]]|volume=1|issue=5|date=July 1993|page=4}}</ref> The film adaptation of ''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'' was released on March 11, 1984. It was released before [[Studio Ghibli]] was established, but it is generally considered a Studio Ghibli film. Helen McCarthy has noted that it was Miyazaki's creation of the Nausica\u00e4 manga \" ... that had, in a way, started the actual process of his studio's development\".{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=45}} The film was released with a recommendation from the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)]].{{sfnm|1a1=Animage February 10|1y=1984|1p=181|2a1=Kan\u014d|2y=2007|2p=64}}\n\nIn his retrospective on ''50 years of Postwar Manga'', Osamu Takeuchi wrote that, in an ironic twist of fate, the ''Nausica\u00e4'' film had been playing in theatres, at the same time as the 1984 anime adaptation of one of the illustrated stories Miyazaki had grown up reading, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kenya Boy|ja|3=\u5c11\u5e74\u30b1\u30cb\u30e4}}'', originally written by {{Interlanguage link multi|Soji Yamakawa|ja|3=\u5c71\u5ddd\u60e3\u6cbb}} in 1951. Takeuchi observed that the release of its inspirational predecessor \"would have been devoured\" by Miyazaki's ''Nausica\u00e4'' in a competition of the two works. He went on to note that, in spite of a brief Yamakawa revival around that time, the media for story telling had progressed and a turning point in time had been passed.<ref name=\"Takeuchi(1995)\">{{cite book |last=Takeuchi |first=Osamu |date=April 5, 2002| origyear=first published March 30, 1995 |script-title=ja:\u6226\u5f8c\u30de\u30f3\u30ac50\u5e74\u53f2 |trans-title=50 Years of Post-War Manga|url=http://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480052018/ |language=Japanese |location=Tokyo |publisher=Chikuma Shobo |edition=5th | page=49 | isbn=978-4480052018 |accessdate=December 20, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe story of the ''Nausica\u00e4'' film is much simpler than that of the manga, roughly corresponding to the first two books of the manga, the point the story had reached when film production began.<ref name=\"chapter_guide\" /> In his interview for ''Yom'' (1994) Miyazaki explained that he worked from the precept that a film requires an opening and a closing of the story. He stated that, within the confines he set for closing the story, he took the film's narrative up to ''Nausica\u00e4's'' \"{{Nihongo|Copernican turn|\u30b3\u30da\u30eb\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u7684\u8ee2\u56de|koperunikusutekitenkai}}\", which came after the character realises the nature of the ''Sea of Corruption''.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=6}} There are significant differences in plot, with more locations, factions and characters appearing in the manga, as well as more detailed environmentalist themes. The tone of the manga is also more philosophical than the film. Miyazaki has ''Nausica\u00e4'' explore the concepts of fatalistic [[nihilism]] and has her struggle with the [[militarism]] of major powers. The series has been interpreted from the views of [[utopia]]n concepts, as well as religious studies.{{sfnm|1a1=Inaba|1y=1996|2a1=Yamanaka|2y=2008|2p=246ff|3a1=Masaki|3y=2001}}\n\nIn ''The Christianizing of Animism in Manga and Anime'', Eriko Ogihara-Schuck conducted a comparative analysis of the religious themes in the manga and the film. Ogihara-Schuck wrote that Miyazaki had started out with animistic themes, such a belief in the god of the wind, in the early chapters of the manga, had conflated the animistic and Judeo-Christian traditions in the anime adaptation, but had returned to the story by expanding on the animistic themes and by infusing it with a non-dualistic worldview when he created additional chapters of the manga, dissatisfied with the manner in which these themes had been handled for the film. Drawing on the scene in which ''Nausica\u00e4'' sacrifices her own life, in order to placate the stampeding Ohmu, and is subsequently resurrected by the miraculous powers of these giant insects, Ogihara-Schuck notes that \"Japanese scholars Takashi Sasaki and Masashi Shimizu consider ''Nausica\u00e4'' a Christ-like savior, and American scholar Susan Napier considers her as an active female messiah figure\". Ogihara-Schuck contrasts these views with Miyazaki's own belief in the omnipresence of gods and spirits and Hiroshi Aoi's argument that ''Nausica\u00e4's'' self-sacrifice is grounded on an animistic recognition of such spirits. Ogihara-Schuck quotes Miyazaki's comments in which he indicated that ''Nausica\u00e4's'' self-sacrifice is not as a savior of her people but is a decision driven by her desire to return the baby Ohmu and by her respect for nature, as she is \"dominated by animism\". Ogihara-Schuck concludes that in many of his later films, much more than in the anime version of ''Nausica\u00e4'', Miyazaki expressed his own belief in the animistic world view and is at his most direct in the manga by putting the dualistic world view and the animistic belief in tension and, through ''Nausica\u00e4's'' ultimate victory, makes the animistic world view superior.{{sfnm|1a1=Ogihara-Schuck|1y=2010|1p=133\u2013146}}\n\nNo chapters of the manga were published in the period between the July 1983 issue and the August 1984 issue of ''Animage'' but series of ''Nausica\u00e4 Notes'' and ''The Road to Nausicaa'' were printed in the magazine during this interim period.<ref name=\"chapter_guide\" /> Frequently illustrated with black and white images from the story boards as well as colour illustrations from the upcoming release of the film, these publications provide background about the history of the manga and development of the film. 1984 was declared The Year of Nausica\u00e4, on the cover of the February 1984 issue of ''Animage''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://animage.jp/old/col/col_07/col_07_19.html | script-title=ja:\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5\u30d2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30ab \u7b2c19\u56de 1984\u5e74\u306e\u300c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5\u300d | date=December 25, 2008 | publisher=Tokuma Shoten | language=Japanese | trans-title=Animage Historica, 19th episode, 1984's Animage | accessdate=December 30, 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515071402/http://animage.jp/old/col/col_07/col_07_19.html | archivedate=May 15, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{sfnm|1a1=Haraguchi|1y=1996|1p=61}}\n\n===Other===\nSeveral other Nausica\u00e4 related materials have been released. {{nihongo | ''Hayao Miyazaki's Image Board Collection'' | \u5bae\u5d0e\u99ff\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u96c6 | Miyazaki Hayao im\u0113jib\u014ddo-sh\u016b }} contains a selection from the sketchbooks Miyazaki created between 1980 and 1982 <!--Nausica\u00e4 related dates, the book obviously also contains ''Pipi'' concept drawings and other artwork created earlier --> to record his ideas for potential future projects.

It tells the story of [[Nausica\u00e4 (character)|Nausica\u00e4]], a princess of a small kingdom on a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Earth]] with a toxic [[ecosystem|ecological system]], who becomes involved in a war between kingdoms while an [[environmental disaster]] threatens humankind.\n\nPrior to creating ''Nausica\u00e4'', Miyazaki had worked as an animator for [[Toei Animation]], [[Nippon Animation]] and [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] (TMS), the latter for whom he had directed his feature film debut, ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro|Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' (1979). After working on an aborted adaptation of [[Richard Corben]]'s ''Rowlf'' for TMS and the publishing firm [[Tokuma Shoten]], he agreed to create a manga series for Tokuma's monthly magazine ''[[Animage]]'', initially on the condition that it would not be adapted into a film. ''Nausica\u00e4'' was influenced by the Japanese folk tale ''[[The Lady who Loved Insects|The Princess who Loved Insects]]'', [[Nausicaa|a similarly-named character]] from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', the [[Minamata Bay|Minamata Bay mercury pollution]], and various works of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] by Western writers, among other sources. The manga was serialized intermittently in ''Animage'' from February 1982 to March 1994 and the individual chapters were collected and published by Tokuma Shoten in seven ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. It was serialized with an English translation in [[North America]] by [[Viz Media]] from 1988 to 1996 as a series of 27 [[comic book]] issues and has been published in collected form multiple times.\n\nSince its initial serialization, ''Nausica\u00e4'' has become a commercial success, particularly in Japan, where at least 11 million copies have been sold. The manga and the 1984 [[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|film adaptation]], written and directed by Miyazaki following the serialization of the manga's first sixteen chapters,<!-- 'Following the serialization of' is probably more appropriate that 'based on', since this source (http://www.utdallas.edu/research/spacesciences/hairston/nausicaamanga_film.html - from the University of Dallas) covers the areas of the manga the film adapts and since this source (http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html) shows that chapters 15 and 16 are the opening chapters of vol. 3, none of which was adapted for the film. --> received universal acclaim from critics and scholars for its characters, themes, and art. The manga and film versions of ''Nausica\u00e4'' are also credited for the foundation of [[Studio Ghibli]], the animation studio for which Miyazaki created several of his most recognized works.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting===\n{{See also|List of Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind characters}}\n\nThe story is set in the future at the closing of the [[Ceramic engineering|ceramic]] era, 1,000 years after the Seven Days of Fire, a cataclysmic global war, in which [[Industrialisation|industrial civilization]] self-destructed. Although humanity survived, the land surface of the Earth is still heavily polluted and the seas have become poisonous. Most of the world is covered by the Sea of Corruption, a toxic forest of fungal life and plants which is steadily encroaching on the remaining open land. It is protected by large mutant insects, including the massive Ohmu. Humanity clings to survival in the polluted lands beyond the forest, periodically engaging in bouts of internecine fighting for the scarce resources that remain. The ability for space travel has been lost but the earth-bound remnants of humanity can still use [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]] and [[powered aircraft]] for exploration, transportation and warfare. (Powered [[Vehicles|land vehicles]] are mostly nonexistent, with humanity regressed to dependence on [[Working animal|riding animals and beasts-of-burden]].)\n\n===Plot===\n[[File:Nausicaa2p121.jpg|thumb|The Dorok prophecy: \"''And that one shall come to you garbed in raiment of blue and descending upon a field of gold''...\"]]\n\n[[Nausica\u00e4 (character)|Nausica\u00e4]] is the princess of the Valley of the Wind, a state on the periphery of what was once known as Eftal, a kingdom destroyed by the Sea of Corruption, a poisonous forest, 300 years ago. An inquisitive young woman, she explores the territories surrounding the Valley on a jet-powered glider, and studies the Sea of Corruption.\n\nThe valley of the wind lead by the aging and sick king Jhil, is subordinate to the Vai emperor of Tourumekia. Most cities, tribes, villages, valleys ect. of the new earth are in some form of another part of either Dorok or Torumekian command: Two massive nations that have been at odds or at war for thousand(s) of years. Torumekia has a large army, and does not appear to be religious. The Doroks are sectarian, with military and strategic higher ranks assigned to priests. Doroks and Torumekian people usually dislike each other, but there are various exceptions.\n\nThe Vai emporer has four children: 3 unnamed sons, and his daughter Kushana. The royal family is notorious for internal conflicts, backstabbing schemes, and desperate attempts to obtain or hold on to the power of the throne. The Doroks have a more stable government composed of the emperor, his brother, and the \u201cCouncil of Elders\u201d.\n\n==== Chapter 1: The Valley of the Wind. ====\nNausica\u00e4 is studying plants deep within the sea of corruption. While lying in peace and tranquillity on a dead ohmu shell, she suddenly has brief visions and flashes saying \u201c''Hate''\u201d or \u201c''Death''\u201d. Someone is being chased by a raging ohmu, and Nausica\u00e4 comes to the rescue by calming it down. Her teacher and good friend Yupa had accidentally angered an ohmu after an incident with a baby fox-squirrel. Nausica\u00e4 adopts the squirrel and names it \u201cTeto\u201d. They return to the valley of the wind.\n\nNausica\u00e4 tries out a gunship with her uncle Mito. She once again has similar visions and flashes of anger and hatred, and almost crashes the ship. In the distance they notice a refugee ship covered with insects. Their attempt to save it fails, and all the passagers die. In the wreckage and fire they meet and hear the dying words of Raspel: The princess of Torumekia-subsidiary Pejite. Apparently torumekian imperial guards working for the emporer invaded and burned down their entire village. Raspel hands Nausica\u00e4 a special stone that\u2019s she wants delivered to her brother, Asbel. The imperial guards are very interested in this stone, as they soon after show up with wormhandlers and examine and loot through all the dead bodies. They suspect the people of the valley of the wind are in possession of the stone, and immediately organize an attack.\n\nNausica\u00e4 has just returned to the valley when the torumekian troops attack. The imperial guards send in worm handlers to search for the stone, but Nausica\u00e4 stops them. Disgusted and angered by their attack and the realization that they disrespectfully looted the dead bodies, she engages in on-ground combat with one of the soldiers. Nausica\u00e4 impales the soldier from the neck with a knife, and - despite the fact that he is already dead - tries to stab him in the heart with a sword too. Yupa stops her (by taking a hit himself) and convinces both sides to stop fighting.\n\nThe Vai emporer declares war on the doroks. Kushana is quite dissatisfied with her role, and suspects a backstabbing scheme by her brothers. They have been assigned to work with large armies and big important battles with lots of loot and slaves, while she has been assigned but a few men to \u201cthreaten the enemy flank\u201d near the poisonous sea of corruption. She is also tasked with finding the stone. Her newly chosen staff officer / watchdog is Kurotowa.\n\nKushana forces a set of peripheries of Torumekia, including The Valley Of The Wind, to help in the war. They are to meet first by air. Aging king Jhil sends Nausica\u00e4, Mito, and a few others from the valley. In the air, many ships are suddenly shot down by a small gunship controlled by Aspel of Pejite. There are great losses, and many soldiers die. Aspel\u2019s plane is finally shot down, but he lands in the forest and survives. Nausica\u00e4 and her men crash by a lake in the sea of corruption. Ohmu appear from below the sea, and tell Nausica\u00e4 that they are ready, and that the northern forest has no use for them anymore. Soon after, a bunch of angry insects appear, all flying towards some destination in the south. Nausica\u00e4 follows the insects and accidentally meets Aspel. Surrounded by insects, they both cling to survival. In the end they are saved by the ohmu, who appear fond of Nausica\u00e4. When the insects leave, they are left in the deepest depths of the sea of corruption, but find, to their surprise, a clean and beautiful non-poisonous area with breathable air. Nausica\u00e4 hides the stone, Aspel fixes the wind glider, and they both take off\n\n==== Chapter 2: The Sea Of Corruption. ====\nNausica\u00e4 and Asbel are nearly shot down by a group of doroks known as the Mani tribe. Their leader comes out, and tells them to stop the fighting. He \u201cinvites\u201d Nausica\u00e4 and Asbel on board. Here they meet Ketcha, a girl from the Mani tribe. She tells Nausica\u00e4 to chat with their leader. Much of the Mani tribe and its land has been destroyed by Torumekian troops. The leader and his tribe are currently headed for the encampment were Kushana landed her forces to fix airships and prepare weapons and tactics. They were told this info has come from someone within the royal family. Nausica\u00e4 and Asbel realize that the Mani tribe\u2019s true plan is to raid the Torumekian-allied periphery lands (including the Valley of Wind) to replace their own lost land, and attempt to convince the Mani by force to do otherwise. The attempt fails, and Nausica\u00e4 flees from the ship, saved by Uncle Mito on a search mission.\n\nAt Kushana\u2019s camp, a battle suddenly breaks lose. Doroks soldiers had prepared a trap, and are now attacking the Torumekian and Periphery troops and airplanes. On top of this, the Doroks have a plan: A small \"flying jar\" squad is flying a baby Ohmu towards Kushana's encampent to attract a giant herd of massive angry Ohmu. The technique is successful, and all of Kushana\u2019s forces are brutally wiped out. Only her, Kurotowa, and a few loyal soldiers escape on a single airship. A warning from Nausicaa and Mito enabled all the Periphery troops and airships to narrowly escape (the chaos of the battle led to the Torumekians forces getting the warning too late). Nausicaa sees the baby Ohmu, and tries to stop the Dorok flying jar from advancing any further. She shoots down the flying jar that carries the Ohmu, and it crashes on a small sandbank in a lake of acid. The Ohmu is severely injured but alive, and although Nausica\u00e4 attempts to kill it using the jar's machine gun, she cannot bring herself to do so.  The herd appears, and the baby Ohmu tries to cross the acid lake in an attempt to reach the herd. Nausica\u00e4 tries to prevent this, and her foot is burned by the acid. The baby Ohmu stops and heals Nausica\u00e4 using its golden feelers, while its blood dyes her dress a deep, pure blue. The herd of Ohmu, still waiting on the banks, nearly commit mass-suicide in their attempt to walk through the lake of acid and retrieve the baby. Kushana's airship flies overhead, Nausica\u00e4 asks her to carry the Ohmu in exchange for all the information she knows about the Doroks and the stone. Kushana orders her ship to carry the Ohmu to the herd, and Nausica\u00e4 is celebrated and taken up by the Ohmu in their feelers so that it looks like she is standing in \u201ca field of gold\u201d.\n\nYupa is out searching for the secrets of the Sea of Corruption - it\u2019s cause, and how it works. He secretly breaks into a ship controlled by wormhandlers, and is taken to an underground wormhandler enclave that doubles as a Dorok base. The Mani tribe survivors, their priest, Asbel (in disguise as a Mani tribe warrior), and Ketcha are all there. A priest from the council of elders is disappointed with the Mani tribe leader, who has criticized the decision to use Ohmu in battle. Yupa, hiding in the pipes, hears the entire conversation, but is caught by a wormhandler. In the process of evading capture, he is caught entering a room where baby Ohmu are artificially bred in tanks. The wormhandlers attempt to capture Yupa under the orders of Dorok priests, but are unsuccessful. Right before a force of wormhandlers swarms Yupa, a \"Mani tribe warrior\" challenges him to a duel, a match which is approved of by the Dorok priests as a way for the Mani tribe to prove their loyalty. The Mani tribe warrior reveals himself to be Asbel, and shatters the incubation tank with his sword. He and Yupa flee immediately, and meet up with the Mani tribe priest on the surface. Just as the holy emperors brother Miralupa Kulubaluka appears, Yupa, Asbel, Ketcha, and the Mani tribe leader flee. In a telepathic confrontation with the emperor's brother the Mani leader states that the \"blue-clad one\" is real, and that the Dorok leaders are destroying the world, and will trigger a Daikaisho. The Mani tribe leader is stabbed to death by the imperial guards while Miralupa's astral projection searches for Nausica\u00e4, who is currently on Kushana's airship. The Mani tribe leader uses the last of his life force to protect Nausica\u00e4 from the astral projection, though Miralupa is still able to glimpse her face. During the commotion, Yupa, Asbel and Ketcha escape using the wormhandler airship that Yupa snuck in on.\n\n==== Chapter 3: The Dorok War. ====\nYupa, Aspel and Ketcha are caught in a thunderstorm, and struck down by a Dorok airship. The doroks send down wormhandlers to loot their bodies and make sure they are dead. Just as they\u2019re about to cut off Yupa\u2019s hand, they are met by \u201cThe forest people\u201d: An intelligent autonomous indigenous group of people that live in harmony with the sea of corruption through specialised equipment. The forest people are well-respected and worshipped by wormhandlers, so they let the bodies go. Yupa, Aspel and Ketcha have all survived the fall (somehow), and are taken in and treated by the forest people. The forest people explain that the purpose of the sea of corruption is actually to ''clean'' the poisonous air and soil. The trees and plants collect the miasma, and eventually break down to sand and dust.\n\nNausica\u00e4 has joined up with Kushana and Kurutowa. The ohmu told her they went south, and she wants to see why - might as well join up with Kushana and Kurotowa while she has the opportunity. Kushana\u2019s assigned mission has failed (she has neither confronted the enemy flank nor collected the stone) so she attempts to join up with the Third Army unit - which she trained herself. Kurutowa instead is hesitant and that she should join one of her brothers' armies, or goes directly to the Vai emperor, but Kushana sees through his scheme. Her mission was impossible to win, as she was only supposed to collect the stone and be executed for failing to do the rest. Kurutowa confesses that he was indeed sent to kill Kushana (by the Vai emperor himself), but that they might be able to strike up a deal nonetheless: He is to be killed in some way or another due to his entanglement in the royal family, but were he to follow Kushana he might still survive. She, one the other hand, can benefit from a pragmatic and talented staff officer, one that isn\u2019t merely loyal, but thinks for himself as well. Kushana accepts the deal, and they head off to search for the third army.\n\nOn the way, they fly across a small village being bombed by torumekian ships. Kushana and Kurotowa, being at this point enemies of the state, shoot down the ships, and look for the nearest well to get some water. Nausica\u00e4 flies down and explores the city: It appears all the villagers are dead not because of bombings or weapons, but from Miasma and poisoning, even though the village is more than 100 metres away from the nearest forest. Nausica\u00e4 tries to warn the other\u2019s not to go down the well, but a few soldiers end up severely poisoned. On top of the miasma there\u2019s a large insect down there, and it attempts to eat Nausica\u00e4. When it tastes the ohmu blood on her clothes though, it spits her out.\n\nThey fly away from the village. Flying close to the ground so as not to be spotted, they follow a few dorok ships that might lead them to the third army. Nausica\u00e4 notices the miasma getting very strong, and they enter a forest made only of poisonous fungi, so dense with miasma even the insects are dying. Kurotowa reluctantly raises the altitude and flies up above the clouds to the dorok ships. Just barely avoiding getting hit, they fly down again through the miasma and reach a hectic battlefield. A torumekian-occupied Dorok city is surrounded and being invaded by the dorok army, and a sector of Kushana\u2019s third army is trying to defend it. They are failing miserably, as they have been specialised and trained in quick offensives: Not defence. Kushana raises her flag and sword, and watches till the very end. Some of the soldiers had been poisoned by miasma out on the battlefield: The doroks seemed to be in control of it. \n\nKushana decides the next best move is to help another sector of her third army. They're protecting another occupied dorok castle/fort under dorok siege. The assigned leader of the defence is lazy and ruthless; He attempts to fly away with spoils and loot from the war, leaving his soldiers to die, but is stopped by Kushana. The torumekians have captured a bunch of dorok slaves, which Nausica\u00e4 naturally finds disgusting and morally corrupt. She demands that Kushana release the slaves, which is accepted on the condition that Nausica\u00e4 will ride with her on the battlefield.\n\nThe plan is to destroy heavy dorok artillery in a quick offensive. The attack is successful, but the escape will require killing a good many dorok troops. Nausica\u00e4 splits up from the group, attempting a more pacifist solution. It work\u2019s decently well, but a few soldiers must sacrifice their lives as human shields to prevent her from getting shot. Her riding-animal is shot by Charuka of the dorok council of elders. She is almost captured, but the animal regains a last burst of energy (because magic) and Nausica\u00e4 escapes.\n\nThe slaves are released. Charuka rides to the castle to thank the torumekians for their unexpected but kind deed.\n\n==== Chapter 4: Catastrophe. ====\nThough the attack was effective, the torumekian castle is still surrounded by dorok troops. All the airships that could save the soldiers have been taken away by Kushana's brothers to leave her own loyal soldiers to be sacrificed. Kushana and Kurotowa fly on a mission with some soldiers to the south to capture aircraft. They spot a single insect flying south in the same direction - a scout. It\u2019s shot down by an arrogant aristocrat on another aircraft, who drunkenly made a bet for money. In reaction to the death of the scout, a swarm of similar insects appear and attack and subsequently destroy the craft. To escape the angry swarm, Kurotowa pulls up and raises altitude. Above the clouds they find massive swarms of forest insects, all flying south. It\u2019s a mass migration, another so-called \u201cdaikaisho\u201d has begun.\n\nKushana uses the chaos of the upcoming insect attack in her mission to steal the needed aircraft - but her and Kurotowa's plane is rammed by the armoured corvette of one of Kushana\u2019s brothers. Her brother tries to kill them both. Kurotowa is badly injured from the ramming, but manages to buy some time. He and Kushana avoid getting shot just as the insects appear. The armoured corvette takes off, and in the distance is destroyed by insects. Kushana\u2019s most hated brother - the one that poisoned her mother - is dead. She had wanted to kill him her whole life, and suddenly he is just killed by insects, with no involvement from her.\n\nThe insects have really appeared now, and the camp is a bloodbath. Soldiers are killed, eaten, decapitated and crushed by insects everywhere. Hiding as well as they can in the trenches, it is a mere miracle that Kushana and badly-injured Kurotowa survive. A few of Kushana\u2019s best men are holding onto her in fear as the gruesome scene unfolds. Without noticing it herself, she sings a lullaby. She looks at a massive, angry insect directly in the eyes, but it does not choose to kill her.\n\nBack to Nausica\u00e4. She did not choose to follow Kushana, and instead went south on her glider alone - that ''was'' her original goal after all.&nbsp; She discovers a small, empty village. It was once an autonomous independent village, but was later destroyed by the dorok. In the village she meets Chikuku: A small kid with psychic abilities. Inside a religious building she is also greeted by a very old monk in meditation. He tells her that the daikaisho has begun, and that he is excited for \u201cthe great purification\u201d to begin. Nausica\u00e4 disagrees with the notion that everyone and everything has to die for a \u201cnew world to be reborn\u201d but does not get much time to further consider this topic, as a giant insect suddenly falls to the ground. Nausica\u00e4 and Chikuku take to the sky to see what\u2019s up, and notice in the near distance a huge swarm of insects attacking a dorok airship infested with some kind of mold.\n\nThe dorok emperor\u2019s brother Miralupa is on ship, and so is Charuka. Miralupa has issued an order to breed strong mold for use as biological weapons, but the mold has grown explosively and gotten out of hand. Nausica\u00e4 flies to the deck of the ship and is attacked by Miralupa. He has heard of a \u201cblue-clad one\u201d in prophecies and is obsessed with finding and killing Nausica\u00e4. His \u201cphysical form\u201d is old and weak, so he attempts to attack using psychic abilities. He fails. Charuka plans to burn down the ship to hopefully destroy the mold. Nausica\u00e4 helps him out, and they just barely manage to escape the explosive growth of the mold. Unfortunately, burning the ship did not destroy all the mold: A good bit survived and falls to the ground. As it falls to the ground, it forms an umbrella. It shows further signs of intelligence and sentience when scientists approach it by air, and it actively targets and attacks them. On the ground it feeds off dead insect bodies and grows drastically in size. It is shown to be attracted to other molds, as it at one point reaches over 100 metres up to get in contact with a small piece of mold on the scientist\u2019s ship.\n\n==== Chapter 5: Daikaisho. ====\nChapter 5 starts in Shuwa, the dorok capital city. The holy emperor, Namulith, looks at the god-warrior they have found and bred. It has grown, and he is satisfied, but for a moment afraid of it. On the ground, the council of elders, whom Namulith dislikes, accuses him of breaking many rules.\n\nNamulith is about a thousand years old - has gone through many painful transformative surgeries. His brother Miralupa is also very old, but has not chosen to change his body. Instead he has had operations and baths in painful chemicals to keep his original body living. Despite his role as emperor, Namulith has been in the shadows of his brother due to his lack of psychic abilities. Due to the incident with the airplane carrying mold, Miralupa\u2019s body was injured. He must undergo an operation, and Namulith decides to kill him by adding a poisonous substance to his chemical bath. Namulith says he no longer cares for the fate of the dorok people, but that he simply wants to watch the world burn, like it did in the seven days of fire.\n\nBack to Yupa, Ketcha, Aspel, and Mito. They are gathering information and trying to figure out what the torumekians are up to. Everything is chaos among the torumekians. They are in full retreat, looting every dorok village and city they go through of food and everything, and killing or taking every dorok as slaves, and leaving behind \"scorched Earth\". Yupa and the lot fly through this hellscape and come across many areas of doroks and torumekians killed by insects and the spreading forest. Eventually they find Kushana, her soldiers, and Kurotowa. After the insect attack and ensuing miasma, Kushana and her soldiers tried surviving in a crashed aircraft for about a month. They were just about to lose hope as another aircraft finally came. Aspel of Pejite is furious at Kushana for burning down his city, but they eventually decide to join up.\n\nNausica\u00e4, Charuka, and Chikuku are trying to get a hold of the mold. Fire and explosives do not seem to work. There are about three molds, and after mapping out their movements they conclude that they are trying to merge. To much the dismay of Charuka, Nausica\u00e4 and Chikuku use their psychic powers to impersonate a heavenly spirit, as to convince a city of doroks to find the highest hill they know if they want to survive. Nausica\u00e4 also explores an area in sky filled with insect\u2019s circle around some point. At the bottom she finds a dying, fully matured ohmu. She realizes that the insects and the ohmu are not trying to ''attack'' the mold: Rather they are trying to help it. The ohmu are using themselves as food for the mold, and the insects are trying to eat away it\u2019s pain. Nausica\u00e4 realizing just how hopeless the situation is, rides her glider to a hill where she sits alone. Some forest people come and give her a better mask, but she is intent on dying with the ohmu. She finds a heard of ohmu stampeding towards the merging point, jumps onto one, and reaches the middle. She lays on an ohmu as it is being covered with mold. Just before it dies, it opens its mouth and swallows Nausica\u00e4. Inside the ohmu, she is covered with a kind of protective bubble that makes her unconscious. \n\nYupa, Kushana, and the lot reach the city-fortress where she left the remnants of her third army. Now deserted thanks to an earlier evacuation warning from Nausicca, they find only a small group of her soldiers now dead along with a dead heedra, an artificial kind of creature designed for war. Its body regenerates, and it can only be killed by a destroying the brain. Living heedra show up and capture Kushana. Yupa jumps onto the plane that captures Kushana, and the others just barely survive taking off on their own aircraft.\n\nNamulith ordered the capture of Kushana. Not before long she regains consciousness, takes out all the guards, and battles up to the bridge to Namulith. He shows her that the soldiers of her third army are still alive. Namulith will save the soldiers on the condition that they marry, seize Torumekia together, and form a joint dorok-torumekian empire. &nbsp;\n\n==== Chapter 6: The Place Dreamed ====\nThe merging point of the molds grows to a massive forest in the matter of hours. Floods of wormhandler tribes migrate from their hidden villages; these longtime \"outcasts\" and \"untouchables\" now following the spreading forest and taking claim over the devastated Dorok territories. \n\nA forest person helps out Charuka and Chikuku find Nausica\u00e4. She\u2019s unconscious, and they need to find a place she can recover. On their way, they come across Namulith\u2019s ship. While Miralupa is dead, his spirit is somehow still alive, and he immediately rushes to possess Nausicaa. Charuka finds a place for Nausica\u00e4 to rest. Chikuku and the forest person stay, but Charuka returns to Namulith and the dorok army, aware it may be his death.\n\nWe see a dream vision Nausica\u00e4 has while unconscious. She is followed by Miralupa, personified as a scared, old, naked, ugly man. She enters a forest, and meets Selm, a forest person she has \u201cspiritually\u201d met previously in the story. He helps them both ride an ohmu to cross a river. The old man is very happy suddenly. They reach the end of the river and arrive at a petrified sea of corruption that has turned to dust. Beyond it, the nature is beautiful and clean. Grass grows, and there are birds, trees, etc. Miralupa's spirit is now at peace and remains in this clean \"afterlife\" paradise. Nausica\u00e4 wakes up.\n\nMito, Aspel, Ketcha, and Kurotowa accidentally land on the same mountain where Nausica\u00e4 is and all meet up. Forest people also show up, and followed by wormhandlers (all tribes of them now believing Nausica\u00e4 to be a messiah and saviour). They all decide to hurry to the spot where Namulith will marry Kushana. Charuka is being stoned until death on Namulith's orders, but Nausica\u00e4 manages to save him. Dorok ships arrive carrying the god-warrior, and Nausica\u00e4 orders Mito's aircraft to shoot them down. Namulith, Kushana (and secretly Yupa) take off on his ship with the god-warrior atop. Nausica\u00e4 lands on the deck and confronts Namulith. They battle, and he and his heedra gain the upper hand. Since Nausica\u00e4 still has the stone, the warrior awakens and saves her, calling her \"mother\". &nbsp;\n\nNamulith's artificially grown body is injured beyond repair by the god-warrior. He is tired of living and that \u201cThings always turn out as the master of the crypt says they will\u201d.\n\n==== Chapter 7: The Crypt. ====\nKushana, Nausica\u00e4, and the Vai emperor are all intent on going to the crypts of Shuwa. Nausica\u00e4 flies away with the god warrior, has an encounter with Kushana\u2019s brothers (who are also going to the crypt). Teto dies from the radioactive light emitted by the god warrior (whom Nausica\u00e4 has named \u201cOhma\u201d). She asks Ohma to land so she can bury the body. Sick from the light herself, she is offered help by a strange man. \n\nHe takes her to some nearby ruins that look normal and destroyed from the air, but beautifully covered with beautiful foliage and are alive with wonderful animals on the inside. Nausica\u00e4 meet\u2019s Kushana\u2019s brothers in there too. Even though everything seems nice, Nausica\u00e4 realizes something must be wrong, especially upon seeing heedra farmers. She attempts to escape, but is stopped by the man who led her in. She calls upon the spiritual help of Selm, and the man/creature tries to persuade Nausica\u00e4 to stay in the garden. Saving the world is impossible he says: Humans have ''adapted'' to the Poisonous air, and when the sea of corruption eventually cleans the soil, humans as we know them won\u2019t be able to live in the new world of clean air and nature. They\u2019ll cough up blood. He also mentions Namulith and Miralupa's father, the previous Dorok emperor, who centuries back had lived in this same garden and was once a young and hopeful man, intent on saving humanity and the world, and so seized the Dorok throne and made himself emperor. But over time he could not bear the weight of the whole world\u2019s problems and gradually became ruthless and evil. \n\nNausica\u00e4 leaves, and meet\u2019s up with Mito and a group of wormhandlers. She lies and tells them that after the sea of corruption cleans the earth, the world will be wonderful and easy. \n\nYupa, Ketcha, Charuka, Chikuku, Kushana, Kurotowa, the last third army soldiers, and floods of Dorok refugees have gathered on a mountain in the aftermath of Namulith's defeat and death. The Dorok tribes want revenge on the Torumekians and a new conflict is on the brink. Yupa sacrifices his life to protect Kushana and stop the conflict, in a scene that remind the Mani Tribe of what their own leader did to protect them.\n\nThe Vai emperor has already invaded Shuwa. With both emperors dead, it is an easy task. The real problem is entering the crypt itself, which is explosion and bullet proof, and shoots down all intruders with a laser-eye. Ohma has walked to Shuwa while Nausica\u00e4 was in the garden. He manages to shoot down the laser eye (with an explosion the size of an atom bomb) but destroys himself along with all of Shuwa and the Vai emperor's army in the process. The people inside the crypt come out to greet the Vai emperor. They are deliriously old from immortality technology. The Vai emperor walks inside, and Nausica\u00e4 with her tribe of wormhandlers follow shortly thereafter. Mito and Aspel have landed on top of the crypt: It seems to be an organism with regenerative abilities.\n\nNausica\u00e4 and the Vai emperor meet \u201cthe master of the crypt\u201d. ''It'' is a massive \"brain\" in the bottom of the crypt, covered with cryptic text. The people working in the crypt have been slowly deciphering the text for centuries. It contains all human knowledge and art from the old world. Throughout the years they have worked \u201csymbiotically\u201d with different powers: Protection in return for any technology the government might please. Nausica\u00e4 speaks with the Master, who takes the form of hundreds of scientists from the old world that worked to create it. The masters reengineered people to withstand the poisonous air and planned the sea of corruption. Having a power with access to advanced technology and biological tools of war would only speed up the process of destroying the old world so a new one could be reborn. The master says they have the tools to biologically change humans and have them stand the clean air again. Nausica\u00e4 disagrees with the notion that the old world must rot for a better one to appear; Especially since the master of the crypt itself will be in sole charge of creating a \u201cbetter\u201d world. While its intentions might have been pure once, over the course of 2000 years, it, like any other ruler, has been corrupted by power. The crypt thinks it can create a \u201cperfect\u201d world with no darkness, but that is impossible, thinks Nausica\u00e4. With the combined last powers of Ohma, a missile from Mito\u2019s ship, and Nausica\u00e4, the heart of the crypt is destroyed. The whole crypt falls apart, but Nausica\u00e4, the emperor and Aspel all manage to escape.\n\nNausicaa\u2019s friends and allies arrive, and everyone meet\u2019s up. The emperor is dying, and hands over the throne to Kushana. She rejects the offer. People all walk away from the crypt.<!--The country name is Torumekia, so this formulation is fine for identifying to whom they've become vassals.

That same year [[Pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] serialization started of his manga ''[[Sabaku no Tami|People of the Desert]]''. His manga adaptation of [[D\u014dbutsu Takarajima|''Animal Treasure Island'']] was serialized in 1971.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy |1y=1999|1p=219|2a1=Comic Box November 1|2y=1982|2p=111|3a1=Animage June 10|3y=1983|3pp=172,173}}\n\nAfter the December 1979 release of ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', Miyazaki, now at the [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] (TMS) subsidiary [[Telecom Animation Film]], began working on his ideas for an animated film adaptation of [[Richard Corben]]'s comic book ''Rowlf'' and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=249|2a1=Kan\u014d |2y=2007|2pp=37ff, 323}} Around that time Miyazaki was also approached for a series of magazine articles by the editorial staff of [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s ''[[Animage]]''. During subsequent conversations he showed his sketchbooks and talked about basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]] and Osamu Kameyama, at the time working as editors for ''Animage''. They saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Initially two projects were proposed to Tokuma Shoten, that are significant for the eventual creation of Nausica\u00e4: {{Nihongo |''Warring States Demon Castle'' | \u6226\u56fd\u9b54\u57ce | Sengoku ma-j\u014d }}, to be set in the [[Sengoku period]], and an aborted adaptation of Corben's ''Rowlf'', but they were rejected, on July 9, 1981. The proposals were rejected because the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga and because the rights for the adaptation of ''Rowlf'' could not be secured.{{sfnm|1a1=DVD Japan|1y=2003|2a1=DVD UK|2y=2005|3a1=Art|3y=1984|3p=8|4a1=Miyazaki|4y=1996|4p=146|5a1=Miyazaki|5y=2007|5p=146|6a1=Haraguchi|6y=1996|6p=35}}\n\nAn agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that it would never be made into a film.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=73|2a1=Saitani|2y=1995|2p=9}}{{efn|See in particular Miyazaki's answer to Saitani's question: \"Were you asked, from the beginning, to draw the comic with the intention of it becoming an animated work?\"{{sfnm|1a1=Saitani|1y=1995|1p=9}} }} Miyazaki stated in an interview, \"''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'' only really began to take shape once I agreed to serialize it.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1y=1996|1p=149|2a1=Miyazaki|2y=2007|2p=149}} In the December 1981 issue of ''Animage'', it was announced that a new manga series would start in the February 1982 issue of the magazine, despite the fact that Miyazaki had not completed the first episode.

Miyazaki mentions Nakao in the context of a question he is asked about the place ''Nausica\u00e4'' takes in the ''ecology boom'' and does so explaining his shift from a desert to a forest setting. Nakao's influence on his work has been noted by Shiro Yoshioka.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=5|2a1=Yoshioka|2y=2008|p=262}} Miyazaki has identified Tetsuji Fukushima's ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Sabaku no ma\u014d|ja|3=\u6c99\u6f20\u306e\u9b54\u738b}}'' {{nihongo|\u6c99\u6f20\u306e\u9b54\u738b|The Evil Lord of the Desert}}, a story he first read while still in primary school, as one of his earliest influences.

Ogata persuaded Miyazaki to continue.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitani|1y=1995|1p=9}} }} [[Frederik L. Schodt]] observed differences between Nausica\u00e4 and other Japanese manga. He has noted that it was serialized in the large [[Paper size#A series|A4 size]] of ''Animage'', much larger than the normal size for manga. Schodt has also observed that Miyazaki drew much of Nausica\u00e4 in pencil without inking, and that the page and panel layouts, as well as the heavy reliance on storytelling, are more reminiscent of French comics than of Japanese manga. In appearance and sensibilities, ''Nausica\u00e4'' reminds Schodt of the works of [[M\u0153bius]].{{sfnm|1a1=Schodt|1y=1996|1p=278}}\n\nTakekuma has noted stylistic changes in Miyazaki's artwork over the course of the series. He points out that, particularly in the first chapters, the panels are densely filled with background, which makes the main characters difficult to discern without paying close attention. According to Takekuma this may be partially explained by Miyazaki's use of pencil, without inking, for much of the series. Takekuma points out that by employing pencil Miyazaki does not give himself the option of much variation in his line. He notes that in the later chapters Miyazaki uses his line art to, literally, draw attention to individuals and that he more frequently separates them from the background. As a result there are more panels in which the main characters stand out vividly in the latter part of the manga.{{sfnm|1a1=Takekuma|1y=2008}}\n\nMiyazaki has stated in interviews that he frequently worked close to publication deadlines and that he was not always able to finish his monthly instalments for serialization in ''Animage''. On such occasions he sometimes created apologetic cartoons. These were printed in the magazine, instead of story panels, to explain to his readers why there were fewer pages that month or why the story was absent entirely. Miyazaki has indicated that he continued making improvements to the story prior to the publication of the ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes, in which chapters from the magazine were collected in book form.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=17}} Changes made throughout the story, before the release of each ''tank\u014dbon'' volume, range from subtle additions of shading to the insertion of entirely new pages. Miyazaki also redrew panels and sometimes the artwork was changed on whole pages. He made alterations to the text and changed the order in which panels appeared. The story as re-printed in the ''tank\u014dbon'' spans 7 volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages.<ref name=\"Ryan(Comparison)\">{{Cite web| title=Nausica\u00e4 Manga Comparison | url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/naucompare.html | last=Ryan | first= Scott | publisher=Nausicaa.net | accessdate=December 31, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMiyazaki has said that the lengthy creation process of the ''Nausica\u00e4'' manga, repeatedly tackling its themes as the story evolved over the years, not only changed the material but also affected his personal views on life and changed his political perspectives. He also noted that his continued struggle with the subject matter in the ongoing development of the Nausica\u00e4 manga allowed him to create different, lighter, films than he would have been able to make without Nausica\u00e4 providing an outlet for his more serious thoughts throughout the period of its creation.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=15\u201316}} Marc Hairston notes that, \u201cTellingly, Miyazaki\u2019s first film after finishing the ''Nausica\u00e4'' manga was ''[[Princess Mononoke|Mononoke Hime]]'', which examined many of the themes from the manga and is arguably the darkest film of his career.\u201d{{sfnm|1a1=Hairston|1y=2010|1p=177\u2013178}}\n\n===Localization===\n''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'' was initially translated into English by [[Toren Smith]] and Dana Lewis. Smith, who had written comics in the U.S. since 1982, wrote an article on [[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)#Warriors of the Wind|''Warriors of the Wind'']] (the heavily edited version of the film adaptation released in the U.S. in the 1980s) for the Japanese edition of [[Starlog]], in which he criticized what [[New World Pictures]] had done to Miyazaki's film. The article came to the attention of Miyazaki himself, who invited Smith to Studio Ghibli for a meeting. On Miyazaki's insistence, Smith's own company [[Studio Proteus]] was chosen as the producer of the English-language translation. Smith hired Dana Lewis to collaborate on the translation. Lewis was a professional translator in Japan who also wrote for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and had written cover stories for such science fiction magazines as ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'' and ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. Smith hired [[Tom Orzechowski]] for the lettering and retouching.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1995|1p=44-47}}\n\nStudio Proteus was responsible for the translation, the lettering, and the retouching of the artwork, which was flipped left-to-right to accommodate English readers. The original Japanese dialogue was re-lettered by hand, the original sound effects were replaced by English sound effects, and the artwork was retouched to accommodate the new sound effects. When Miyazaki resumed work on the manga following one of the interruptions, Viz chose another team, including [[Rachel Matt Thorn]] and Wayne Truman, to complete the series.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1995|1p=47}} The current seven-volume, English-language \"Editor's Choice\" edition is published in right-to-left reading order: while it retains the original translations, the lettering was done by Walden Wong. The touch-up art and lettering for the Viz Media deluxe two-volume box set was also done by Walden Wong.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Miyazaki\n | first = Hayao\n | title = Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\n | volume = Deluxe Edition I\n | location = San Francisco\n | date = 2012\n | isbn = 978-1421550640\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book\n | last = Miyazaki\n | first = Hayao\n | title = Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\n | volume = Deluxe Edition II\n | location = San Francisco\n | date = 2012\n | isbn = 978-1421550640\n}}\n</ref>\n\nEriko Ogihara-Schuck, lecturer in American studies at the [[Technical University of Dortmund]], conducted a comparative analysis of the Japanese-language manga and anime with their English translations, and demonstrates that American translations have resulted in the \"[[Christianity|Christian]]izing of Miyazaki's [[animism]]\". She indicates that this was probably done inadvertently in the case of the manga translation, which retains animistic elements and contains [[pantheistic]] phrases, but may have been more deliberate in the translation of dialogue and narration for [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s release of the film. In the case of the manga she attributes this \"Christianizing\" to the limitations of the languages involved, particularly the absence of precise English equivalents for Japanese words and concepts such as ''[[kami]]'', ''[[oni]]'' and ''[[Wrathful deities|kishin]]'' and honorific titles such as ''[[Japanese honorifics#Sama|sama]]''. As another explanation, she offers that translators of both the manga and the film work from a [[Judeo-Christian]] background, in a language suffused with Judeo-Christian [[idiom]]s not found in Japanese, which they introduce to the text, and she indicates that the translators work for an audience more accustomed to, and with the expectation of, the Judeo-Christian religions' [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]], [[Conflict between good and evil|good versus evil]] [[worldview]] in fictional narratives. Ogihara-Schuck concludes that particularly the film translation erased animistic motifs completely but that the manga translations, \"by enveloping the text in a dualistic world view\", also implicitly reintroduced this dualistic, good versus evil, worldview, absent in the original Japanese language manga, which she presumes to have been a strategy to make the works more accessible to the American audience.{{sfnm|1a1=Ogihara-Schuck|1y=2010|1p=133\u2013146}}\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\nThe manga was serialized in [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s monthly ''[[Animage]]'' magazine between 1982 and 1994.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=442\u2013445}} The series initially ran from the February 1982 issue to the November 1982 issue when the first interruption occurred due to Miyazaki's work related trip to Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Animage October 10|1y=1982|1p=181}} Serialization resumed in the December issue and the series ran again until June 1983 when it went on hiatus again due to Miyazaki's work on the film adaptation of the series. Serialization of the manga resumed for the third time from the August 1984 issue but halted again in the May 1985 issue when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on ''[[Laputa]]''. Serialization resumed for the fourth time in the December 1986 issue and was halted again in June 1987 when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on the films ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''. The series resumed for the fifth time in the April 1990 issue and was halted in the May 1991 issue when Miyazaki worked on ''[[Porco Rosso]]''. The series resumed for the final time in the March 1993 issue. The final panel is dated January 28, 1994. The last chapter was released in the March 1994 issue of ''Animage''. By the end Miyazaki had created 59 chapters, of varying length, for publication in the magazine. In an interview, conducted shortly after serialization of the manga had ended, he noted that this amounts to approximately 5 years worth of material. He stated that he did not plan for the manga to run that long and that he wrote the story based on the idea that it could be stopped at any moment.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=9|2a1=Animage February 10|2y=1994|2p=204|3a1=Yom June 1|3y=1994|3p=3}}<ref name=\"chapter_guide\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html|title=Chapter guide | last=Ryan | first=Scott|work=Nausicaa.net | publisher=Team Ghiblink | accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe chapters were slightly modified and collected in seven ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes, in soft cover [[Paper size#Japanese B-series variant|B5 size]].<ref name=\"Ryan(Comparison)\"/> The first edition of volume one is dated September 25, 1982.

As of 2013 Viz Media has released the manga in five different formats. Initially the manga was printed flipped and with English translations of the sound effects. Publication of English editions began in 1988 with the release of episodes from the story under the title ''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind'' in the \"Viz Select Comics\" series. This series ran until 1996. It consists of 27 issues. In October 1990 Viz Media also started publishing the manga as ''Viz Graphic Novel, Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind''. The last of the seven Viz Graphic Novels in this series appeared in January 1997. Viz media reprinted the manga in four volumes titled, ''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind: Perfect Collection'', which were released from October 1995 to October 1997. A box set of the four volumes was later released in January 2000. In 2004 Viz Media re-released the seven-volume format in an \"Editors Choice\" edition titled ''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind''.

serialization of the manga was underway and the story had proven to be popular among its readers, ''Animage'' came back on their promise not to turn the manga into an animation project and approached Miyazaki to make a 15 minute Nausica\u00e4 film. Miyazaki declined. Instead he proposed a sixty-minute [[Original video animation|OVA]]. In a counter offer Tokuma agreed to sponsor a feature-length film for theatrical release.<ref name= \"Animerica(1993)\">{{cite journal |last=Oshiguchi | first=Takashi | title=The whimsy and wonder of Hayao Miyazaki | journal=[[Animerica]]|volume=1|issue=5|date=July 1993|page=4}}</ref> The film adaptation of ''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'' was released on March 11, 1984. It was released before [[Studio Ghibli]] was established, but it is generally considered a Studio Ghibli film. Helen McCarthy has noted that it was Miyazaki's creation of the Nausica\u00e4 manga \" ... that had, in a way, started the actual process of his studio's development\".{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=45}} The film was released with a recommendation from the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)]].{{sfnm|1a1=Animage February 10|1y=1984|1p=181|2a1=Kan\u014d|2y=2007|2p=64}}\n\nIn his retrospective on ''50 years of Postwar Manga'', Osamu Takeuchi wrote that, in an ironic twist of fate, the ''Nausica\u00e4'' film had been playing in theatres, at the same time as the 1984 anime adaptation of one of the illustrated stories Miyazaki had grown up reading, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kenya Boy|ja|3=\u5c11\u5e74\u30b1\u30cb\u30e4}}'', originally written by {{Interlanguage link multi|Soji Yamakawa|ja|3=\u5c71\u5ddd\u60e3\u6cbb}} in 1951. Takeuchi observed that the release of its inspirational predecessor \"would have been devoured\" by Miyazaki's ''Nausica\u00e4'' in a competition of the two works. He went on to note that, in spite of a brief Yamakawa revival around that time, the media for story telling had progressed and a turning point in time had been passed.<ref name=\"Takeuchi(1995)\">{{cite book |last=Takeuchi |first=Osamu |date=April 5, 2002| origyear=first published March 30, 1995 |script-title=ja:\u6226\u5f8c\u30de\u30f3\u30ac50\u5e74\u53f2 |trans-title=50 Years of Post-War Manga|url=http://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480052018/ |language=Japanese |location=Tokyo |publisher=Chikuma Shobo |edition=5th | page=49 | isbn=978-4480052018 |accessdate=December 20, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe story of the ''Nausica\u00e4'' film is much simpler than that of the manga, roughly corresponding to the first two books of the manga, the point the story had reached when film production began.<ref name=\"chapter_guide\" /> In his interview for ''Yom'' (1994) Miyazaki explained that he worked from the precept that a film requires an opening and a closing of the story. He stated that, within the confines he set for closing the story, he took the film's narrative up to ''Nausica\u00e4's'' \"{{Nihongo|Copernican turn|\u30b3\u30da\u30eb\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u7684\u8ee2\u56de|koperunikusutekitenkai}}\", which came after the character realises the nature of the ''Sea of Corruption''.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=6}} There are significant differences in plot, with more locations, factions and characters appearing in the manga, as well as more detailed environmentalist themes. The tone of the manga is also more philosophical than the film. Miyazaki has ''Nausica\u00e4'' explore the concepts of fatalistic [[nihilism]] and has her struggle with the [[militarism]] of major powers. The series has been interpreted from the views of [[utopia]]n concepts, as well as religious studies.{{sfnm|1a1=Inaba|1y=1996|2a1=Yamanaka|2y=2008|2p=246ff|3a1=Masaki|3y=2001}}\n\nIn ''The Christianizing of Animism in Manga and Anime'', Eriko Ogihara-Schuck conducted a comparative analysis of the religious themes in the manga and the film. Ogihara-Schuck wrote that Miyazaki had started out with animistic themes, such a belief in the god of the wind, in the early chapters of the manga, had conflated the animistic and Judeo-Christian traditions in the anime adaptation, but had returned to the story by expanding on the animistic themes and by infusing it with a non-dualistic worldview when he created additional chapters of the manga, dissatisfied with the manner in which these themes had been handled for the film. Drawing on the scene in which ''Nausica\u00e4'' sacrifices her own life, in order to placate the stampeding Ohmu, and is subsequently resurrected by the miraculous powers of these giant insects, Ogihara-Schuck notes that \"Japanese scholars Takashi Sasaki and Masashi Shimizu consider ''Nausica\u00e4'' a Christ-like savior, and American scholar Susan Napier considers her as an active female messiah figure\". Ogihara-Schuck contrasts these views with Miyazaki's own belief in the omnipresence of gods and spirits and Hiroshi Aoi's argument that ''Nausica\u00e4's'' self-sacrifice is grounded on an animistic recognition of such spirits. Ogihara-Schuck quotes Miyazaki's comments in which he indicated that ''Nausica\u00e4's'' self-sacrifice is not as a savior of her people but is a decision driven by her desire to return the baby Ohmu and by her respect for nature, as she is \"dominated by animism\". Ogihara-Schuck concludes that in many of his later films, much more than in the anime version of ''Nausica\u00e4'', Miyazaki expressed his own belief in the animistic world view and is at his most direct in the manga by putting the dualistic world view and the animistic belief in tension and, through ''Nausica\u00e4's'' ultimate victory, makes the animistic world view superior.{{sfnm|1a1=Ogihara-Schuck|1y=2010|1p=133\u2013146}}\n\nNo chapters of the manga were published in the period between the July 1983 issue and the August 1984 issue of ''Animage'' but series of ''Nausica\u00e4 Notes'' and ''The Road to Nausicaa'' were printed in the magazine during this interim period.<ref name=\"chapter_guide\" /> Frequently illustrated with black and white images from the story boards as well as colour illustrations from the upcoming release of the film, these publications provide background about the history of the manga and development of the film. 1984 was declared The Year of Nausica\u00e4, on the cover of the February 1984 issue of ''Animage''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://animage.jp/old/col/col_07/col_07_19.html | script-title=ja:\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5\u30d2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30ab \u7b2c19\u56de 1984\u5e74\u306e\u300c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5\u300d | date=December 25, 2008 | publisher=Tokuma Shoten | language=Japanese | trans-title=Animage Historica, 19th episode, 1984's Animage | accessdate=December 30, 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515071402/http://animage.jp/old/col/col_07/col_07_19.html | archivedate=May 15, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{sfnm|1a1=Haraguchi|1y=1996|1p=61}}\n\n===Other===\nSeveral other Nausica\u00e4 related materials have been released. {{nihongo | ''Hayao Miyazaki's Image Board Collection'' | \u5bae\u5d0e\u99ff\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u96c6 | Miyazaki Hayao im\u0113jib\u014ddo-sh\u016b }} contains a selection from the sketchbooks Miyazaki created between 1980 and 1982 <!--Nausica\u00e4 related dates, the book obviously also contains ''Pipi'' concept drawings and other artwork created earlier --> to record his ideas for potential future projects.

After a brief stop in Britain, most likely on the Scottish coast, they crossed the channel and landed in Brittany in 585.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> At [[Saint-Malo]] in Brittany, there is a granite cross bearing the saint's name to which people once came to pray for rain in times of drought.

Despite its remote location in the [[Vosges Mountains]], the community became a popular pilgrimage site that attracted so many monastic vocations that two new monasteries had to be formed to accommodate them.<ref name=\"cna\">{{cite web|title=St. Columbanus |work=Catholic News Agency |date= |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=716 |accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref> In 590, Columbanus obtained from King Gontram the Gallo-Roman castle called ''Luxovium'' in present-day [[Luxeuil-les-Bains]], some eight miles from Annegray.<ref name=jonas-17>Jonas 643, p. 17.</ref> The castle, soon transformed into a monastery, was located in a wild region, thickly covered with pine forests and brushwood. Columbanus erected a third monastery called ''Ad-fontanas'' at present-day [[Fontaine-l\u00e8s-Luxeuil]], named for its numerous springs.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/><ref name=jonas-17/> These monastic communities remained under Columbanus' authority, and their rules of life reflected the Irish tradition in which he had been formed. As these communities expanded and drew more pilgrims, Columbanus sought greater solitude, spending periods of time in a hermitage and communicating with the monks through an intermediary. Often he would withdraw to a cave seven miles away, with a single companion who acted as messenger between himself and his companions.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/><ref name=\"cna\"/><ref name=jonas-17/>\n\nDuring his twenty years in [[Gaul]] (in present-day France), Columbanus became involved in a dispute with the Frankish bishops who may have feared his growing influence. During the first half of the sixth century, the councils of Gaul had given to bishops absolute authority over religious communities. As heirs to the Irish monastic tradition, Columbanus and his monks used the Irish Easter calculation, a version of [[Bishop Augustalis]]'s 84-year ''[[computus]]'' for determining the date of Easter ([[Quartodecimanism]]), whereas the [[Franks]] had adopted the [[Victorius of Aquitaine|Victorian]] cycle of 532 years. The bishops objected to the newcomers' continued observance of their own dating, which\u2014among other issues\u2014caused the end of [[Lent]] to differ. They also complained about the distinct [[Celtic Christianity#Monastic tonsure|Irish tonsure]]. In 602, the bishops assembled to judge Columbanus, but he did not appear before them as requested. Instead, he sent a letter to the prelates\u2014a strange mixture of freedom, reverence, and charity\u2014admonishing them to hold synods more frequently, and advising them to pay more attention to matters of equal importance to that of the date of Easter. In defence of his following his traditional paschal cycle, he wrote:\n{{quote|I am not the author of this divergence. I came as a poor stranger into these parts for the cause of Christ, Our Saviour. One thing alone I ask of you, holy Fathers, permit me to live in silence in these forests, near the bones of seventeen of my brethren now dead.<ref name=\"smith\"/>}}\nWhen the bishops refused to abandon the matter, Columbanus, following Saint Patrick's canon, appealed directly to [[Pope Gregory I]]. In the third and only surviving letter, he asks \"the holy Pope, his Father\" to provide \"the strong support of his authority\" and to render a \"verdict of his favour\", apologising for \"presuming to argue as it were, with him who sits in the chair of Peter, Apostle and Bearer of the Keys\". None of the letters were answered, most likely due to the pope's death in 604.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Columbanus then sent a letter to Gregory's successor, [[Pope Boniface IV]], asking him to confirm the tradition of his elders\u2014if it is not contrary to the Faith\u2014so that he and his monks can follow the rites of their ancestors. Before Boniface responded, Columbanus moved outside the jurisdiction of the Frankish bishops. Since the Easter issue appears to end around that time, Columbanus may have stopped celebrating Irish date of Easter after moving to Italy.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>{{refn|The Italians themselves followed a third system of reckoning Easter, based on the improvements to Victorius's system introduced by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] at the time he devised the [[Anno Domini]] dating system.<ref>Blackburn 1999, p. 767.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nColumbanus was also involved in a dispute with members of the Frankish royal family. Upon the death of King Gontram of Burgundy, the succession passed to his nephew, [[Childebert II]], the son of his brother [[Sigebert I|Sigebert]] and Sigebert's wife [[Brunhilda of Austrasia]]. When Childebert II died, he left two sons, [[Theuderic II]] who inherited the Kingdom of [[Burgundy]], and [[Theudebert II]] who inherited the Kingdom of [[Austrasia]]. Since both were minors, Brunhilda, their grandmother, declared herself their guardian and controlled the governments of the two kingdoms.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\nTheuderic II venerated Columbanus and often visited him, but the saint admonished and rebuked him for his behaviour.  When Theuderic began living with a mistress, the saint objected, earning the displeasure of Brunhilda, who thought a royal marriage would threaten her own power.<ref name=\"cna\"/> The saint did not spare the demoralised court, and Brunhilda became his bitterest foe.<ref name=\"cusack\">Cusack 2002, p. 173.</ref> Angered by the saint's moral stand, Brunhilda stirred up the bishops and nobles to find fault with his monastic rules. When Theuderic II finally confronted Columbanus at Luxeuil, ordering him to conform to the country's conventions, the saint refused and was then taken prisoner to [[Free Imperial City of Besan\u00e7on|Besan\u00e7on]]. Columbanus managed to escape his captors and returned to his monastery at Luxeuil. When the king and his grandmother found out, they sent soldiers to drive him back to Ireland by force, separating him from his monks by insisting that only those from Ireland could accompany him into exile.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\nColumbanus was taken to [[Nevers]], then travelled by boat down the [[Loire]] river to the coast. At [[Tours]] he visited the tomb of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]], and sent a message to Theuderic II indicating that within three years he and his children would perish. When he arrived at [[Nantes]], he wrote a letter before embarkation to his fellow monks at Luxeuil monastery. Filled with love and affection, the letter urges his brethren to obey [[Saint Attala|Attala]], who stayed behind as abbot of the monastic community.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> The letter concludes:\n{{quote|They come to tell me the ship is ready. The end of my parchment compels me to finish my letter. Love is not orderly; it is this which has made it confused. Farewell, dear hearts of mine; pray for me that I may live in God.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>}}\nSoon after the ship set sail from Nantes, a severe storm drove the vessel back ashore. Convinced that his holy passenger caused the tempest, the captain refused further attempts to transport the monk. Columbanus made his way across Gaul to visit King [[Chlothar II]] of Neustria at [[Soissons]] where he was gladly received. Despite the king's offers to stay in his kingdom, Columbanus left Neustria in 611 for the court of King [[Theudebert II]] of [[Austrasia]] in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian Franks]].<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\n===The Alps===\nColumbanus travelled to [[Metz]], where he received an honourable welcome, and then proceeding to [[Mainz]], where he sailed upwards the [[Rhine]] river to the lands of the [[Suebi]] and [[Alemanni]] in the northern Alps, intending to preach the Gospel to these people. He followed the Rhine river and its tributaries, the [[Aar]] and the [[Limmat]], and then on to [[Lake Zurich]]. Columbanus chose the village of [[Tuggen]] as his initial community, but the work was not successful.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> He continued north-east by way of Arbon to [[Bregenz]] on [[Lake Constance]]. Here the saint found an [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] dedicated to Saint Aurelia containing three brass images of their tutelary deities. Columbanus commanded [[Saint Gall|Gallus]], who knew the local language, to preach to the inhabitants, and many were converted. The three brass images were destroyed, and Columbanus blessed the little church, placing the relics of Saint Aurelia beneath the altar. A monastery was erected, [[Wettingen-Mehrerau Abbey|Mehrerau Abbey]], and the brethren observed their regular life. Columbanus stayed in Bregenz for about one year.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Following an uprising against the community, possibly related to that region being taken over by the saint's old enemy King Theuderic II, Columbanus resolved to cross the Alps into Italy.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Gallus remained in this area and died there 646. About seventy years later  at the place of Gallus' cell the [[Abbey of St Gall|Monastery of Saint Gall]] was founded, which in itself was the origin of the city of [[St. Gallen]] again about another three hundred years later.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Location map+ | Alps\n| relief = Y\n| default_width = 300\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Alps\n    | label = Tuggen\n    | lat_deg = 47.2011\n    | lon_deg = 8.94103 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Alps\n    | label = Bregenz\n    | lat_deg = 47.50343\n    | lon_deg = 9.74732 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Alps\n    | label = Milan\n    | lat_deg = 45.46427    \n    | lon_deg = 9.18951 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Alps\n    | label = Bobbio\n    | lat_deg = 44.7716    \n    | lon_deg = 9.38641 }}\n| caption = Columbanus in the Alps and Italy\n}}\nColumbanus arrived in [[Milan]] in 612 and was warmly greeted by King [[Agilulf]] and Queen [[Theodelinda]] of the [[Lombards]].{{refn|Some scholars believe that Columbanus made two journeys into Italy, which were confounded by Jonas. On his first journey, Columbanus went to Rome and received from Pope Gregory I sacred relics.<ref name=\"stokes\">Stokes 2007, p. 132</ref> This may possibly explain the traditional spot in St. Peter's, where Pope Gregory I and Columbanus are supposed to have met.<ref name=\"moran\">Moran 2010, p. 105</ref>|group=Note}} He immediately began refuting the teachings of [[Arianism]], which had enjoyed a degree of acceptance in Italy. He wrote a treatise against Arianism, which has since been lost. Queen Theodelinda, the devout daughter of Duke [[Garibald I of Bavaria]], played an important role in restoring [[Nicene Christianity]] to a position of primacy against Arianism, and was largely responsible for the king's conversion to Christianity.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\nAt the king's request, Columbanus wrote a letter to [[Pope Boniface IV]] on the controversy over the ''[[Three-Chapter Controversy|Three Chapters]]''\u2014writings by Syrian bishops suspected of [[Nestorianism]], which had been condemned in the fifth century as [[heresy]]. [[Pope Gregory I]] had tolerated in Lombardy those persons who defended the ''Three Letters'', among them King Agilulf. Columbanus agreed to take up the issue on behalf of the king. The letter begins with an apology that a \"foolish Scot (''Scottus'', Irishman)\" would be writing for a Lombard king. After acquainting the pope with the imputations brought against him, he entreats the pontiff to prove his orthodoxy and assemble a council. He writes that his freedom of speech is consistent with the custom of his country.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Some of the language used in the letter might now be regarded as disrespectful, but in that time, faith and austerity could be more indulgent.<ref name=\"montalembert-440\">Montalembert 1861, p. 440.</ref> At the same time, the letter expresses the most affectionate and impassioned devotion to the Holy See.\n{{quote|We Irish, though dwelling at the far ends of the earth, are all disciples of Saint Peter and Saint Paul ... we are bound to the Chair of Peter, and although Rome is great and renowned, through that Chair alone is she looked on as great and illustrious among us ... On account of the two Apostles of Christ, you are almost celestial, and Rome is the head of the whole world, and of the Churches.}}\nIf Columbanus' zeal for orthodoxy caused him to overstep the limits of discretion, his real attitude towards Rome is sufficiently clear, calling the pope \"his Lord and Father in Christ\", the \"Chosen Watchman\", and the \"First Pastor, set higher than all mortals\".<ref name=\"allnatt\">Allnatt 2007, p. 105.</ref>\n[[File:Bobbio-abbazia di san colombano-esterno6.jpg|thumb|left|Facade of the Abbey in Bobbio]]\nKing Agilulf gave Columbanus a tract of land called [[Bobbio]] between Milan and Genoa near the [[Trebbia]] river, situated in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] of the [[Apennine Mountains]], to be used as a base for the conversion of the Lombard people. The area contained a ruined church and wastelands known as ''Ebovium'', which had formed part of the lands of the papacy prior to the Lombard invasion. Columbanus wanted this secluded place, for while enthusiastic in the instruction of the Lombards he preferred solitude for his monks and himself. Next to the little church, which was dedicated to [[Saint Peter]], Columbanus erected a monastery in 614. [[Bobbio Abbey]] at its foundation followed the Rule of Saint Columbanus, based on the monastic practices of [[Celtic Christianity]]. For centuries it remained the stronghold of orthodoxy in northern Italy.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>{{refn|Bobbio Abbey may have been the model for the monastery in northern Italy in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]''.|group=Note}}\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:Bobbio bridge.jpg|thumb|Stone bridge over the Trebbia river leading to [[Bobbio Abbey]] in northern Italy]]\nDuring the last year of his life, Columbanus received messenges from King [[Chlothar II]], inviting the saint to return to Burgundy, now that his enemies were dead. Columbanus did not return, but requested that the king should always protect his monks at [[Luxeuil Abbey]]. He prepared for death by retiring to his cave on the mountainside overlooking the Trebbia river, where, according to a tradition, he had dedicated an oratory to Our Lady.<ref name=\"montalembert-444\">Montalembert 1861, p. 444.</ref> Columbanus died at Bobbio on 21 November 615.\n\n==Rule of Saint Columbanus==\nThe Rule of Saint Columbanus embodied the customs of [[Bangor Abbey]] and other Irish monasteries. Much shorter than the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], the Rule of Saint Columbanus consists of ten chapters, on the subjects of obedience, silence, food, poverty, humility, chastity, choir offices, discretion, mortification, and perfection.<ref name=\"ucc\">{{cite web|author=Columbanus Hibernus |editor-last=Walker |editor-first=G.S.M. |title=Monk's Rules |work=Corpus of Electronic Texts |publisher=University College Cork |date= |url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/T201052.html |accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the first chapter, Columbanus introduces the great principle of his Rule: obedience, absolute and unreserved. The words of seniors should always be obeyed, just as \"Christ obeyed the Father up to death for us.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> One manifestation of this obedience was constant hard labour designed to subdue the flesh, exercise the will in daily self-denial, and set an example of industry in cultivation of the soil. The least deviation from the Rule entailed corporal punishment, or a severe form of fasting.<ref name=\"smith\"/> In the second chapter, Columbanus instructs that the rule of silence be \"carefully observed\", since it is written: \"But the nurture of righteousness is silence and peace\". He also warns, \"Justly will they be damned who would not say just things when they could, but preferred to say with garrulous loquacity what is evil ...\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> In the third chapter, Columbanus instructs, \"Let the monks' food be poor and taken in the evening, such as to avoid repletion, and their drink such as to avoid intoxication, so that it may both maintain life and not harm ...\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> Columbanus continues:\n{{quote|For indeed those who desire eternal rewards must only consider usefulness and use. Use of life must be moderated just as toil must be moderated, since this is true discretion, that the possibility of spiritual progress may be kept with a temperance that punishes the flesh. For if temperance exceeds measure, it will be a vice and not a virtue; for virtue maintains and retains many goods. Therefore we must fast daily, just as we must feed daily; and while we must eat daily, we must gratify the body more poorly and sparingly ...\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/>}}\n\n[[Image:Columbanus at Bobbio.jpg|thumb|upright|Fresco of Saint Columbanus in [[Brugnato Cathedral]]]]\nIn the fourth chapter, Columbanus presents the virtue of poverty and of overcoming greed, and that monks should be satisfied with \"small possessions of utter need, knowing that greed is a leprosy for monks\". Columbanus also instructs that \"nakedness and disdain of riches are the first perfection of monks, but the second is the purging of vices, the third the most perfect and perpetual love of God and unceasing affection for things divine, which follows on the forgetfulness of earthly things. Since this is so, we have need of few things, according to the word of the Lord, or even of one.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> In the fifth chapter, Columbanus warns against vanity, reminding the monks of Jesus' warning in Luke 16:15: \"You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> In the sixth chapter, Columbanus instructs that \"a monk's chastity is indeed judged in his thoughts\" and warns, \"What profit is it if he be virgin in body, if he be not virgin in mind? For God, being Spirit.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/>\n\nIn the seventh chapter, Columbanus instituted a service of perpetual prayer, known as ''[[laus perennis]]'', by which choir succeeded choir, both day and night.<ref name=\"montalembert-405\">Montalembert 1898, II p. 405.</ref> In the eighth chapter, Columbanus stresses the importance of discretion in the lives of monks to avoid \"the downfall of some, who beginning without discretion and passing their time without a sobering knowledge, have been unable to complete a praiseworthy life.\" Monks are instructed to pray to God for to \"illumine this way, surrounded on every side by the world's thickest darkness\".<ref name=\"ucc\"/> Columbanus continues: \n{{quote|So discretion has got its name from discerning, for the reason that it discerns in us between good and evil, and also between the moderate and the complete. For from the beginning either class has been divided like light and darkness, that is, good and evil, after evil began through the devil's agency to exist by the corruption of good, but through God's agency Who first illumines and then divides. Thus righteous Abel chose the good, but unrighteous Cain fell upon evil.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/>}}\n\nIn the ninth chapter, Columbanus presents mortification as an essential element in the lives of monks, who are instructed, \"Do nothing without counsel.\" Monks are warned to \"beware of a proud independence, and learn true lowliness as they obey without murmuring and hesitation.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> According to the Rule, there are three components to mortification: \"not to disagree in mind, not to speak as one pleases with the tongue, not to go anywhere with complete freedom.\" This mirrors the words of Jesus, \"For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.\" (John 6:38) In the tenth and final chapter, Columbanus regulates forms of [[penance]] (often corporal) for offences, and it is here that the Rule of Saint Columbanus differs significantly from that of Saint Benedict.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\nThe Communal Rule of Columbanus required monks to fast every day until ''[[Nones (liturgy)|None]]'' or 3 p.m., this was later relaxed and observed on designated days.<ref name=\"Frantzen 2014\">Frantzen, Allen J. (2014). ''Food, Eating and Identity in Early Medieval England''. The Boydell Press. p. 184. {{ISBN|978-1-84383-908-8}}</ref> Columbanus' Rule regarding diet was very strict.

A great deal of time was devoted to various kinds of [[manual labour]], not unlike the life in monasteries of other rules. The Rule of Saint Columbanus was approved of by the [[Fourth Council of M\u00e2con]] in 627, but it was superseded at the close of the century by the Rule of Saint Benedict. For several centuries in some of the greater monasteries the two rules were observed conjointly.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\n==Character==\nColumbanus did not lead a perfect life. According to Jonas and other sources, he could be impetuous and even headstrong, for by nature he was eager, passionate, and dauntless. These qualities were both the source of his power and the cause of his mistakes.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> His virtues, however, were quite remarkable. Like many saints, he had a great love for God's creatures. Stories claim that as he walked in the woods, it was not uncommon for birds to land on his shoulders to be caressed, or for squirrels to run down from the trees and nestle in the folds of his cowl.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Although a strong defender of Irish traditions, he never wavered in showing deep respect for the Holy See as the supreme authority. His influence in Europe was due to the conversions he effected and to the rule that he composed. It may be that the example and success of Saint [[Columba]] in Caledonia inspired him to similar exertions.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> The life of Columbanus stands as the prototype of missionary activity in Europe, followed by such men as [[Saint Kilian]], [[Vergilius of Salzburg]], [[Donatus of Fiesole]], [[Wilfrid]], [[Willibrord]], [[Suitbert of Kaiserwerdt]], [[Saint Boniface]], and [[Ursicinus of Saint-Ursanne]].<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\n==Miracles==\nThe following are the principal miracles attributed to his intercession:<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n# Procuring food for a sick monk and curing the wife of his benefactor\n# Escaping injury while surrounded by wolves\n# Causing a bear to evacuate a cave at his biddings\n# Producing a spring of water near his cave\n# Replenishing the Luxeuil granary\n# Multiplying bread and beer for his community\n# Curing sick monks, who rose from their beds at his request to reap the harvest\n# Giving sight to a blind man at Orleans\n# Destroying with his breath a cauldron of beer prepared for a pagan festival\n# Taming a bear and yoking it to a plough\n\nJonas relates the occurrence of a miracle during Columbanus' time in Bregenz, when that region was experiencing a period of severe famine.\n{{quote|Although they were without food, they were bold and unterrified in their faith, so that they obtained food from the Lord. After their bodies had been exhausted by three days of fasting, they found so great an abundance of birds, just as the quails formerly covered the camp of the children of Israel, that the whole country near there was filled with birds. The man of God knew that this food had been scattered on the ground for his own safety and that of his brethren, and that the birds had come only because he was there. He ordered his followers first to render grateful praises to the Creator, and then to take the birds as food. And it was a wonderful and stupendous miracle; for the birds were seized according to the father's commands and did not attempt to fly away. The manna of birds remained for three days. On the fourth day, a priest from an adjacent city, warned by divine inspiration, sent a supply of grain to Saint Columban. When the supply of grain arrived, the Omnipotent, who had furnished the winged food to those in want, immediately commanded the phalanxes of birds to depart. We learned this from Eustasius, who was present with the others, under the command of the servant of God. He said that no one of them remembered ever having seen birds of such a kind before; and the food was of so pleasant savor that it surpassed royal viands.

Despite its remote location in the [[Vosges Mountains]], the community became a popular pilgrimage site that attracted so many monastic vocations that two new monasteries had to be formed to accommodate them.<ref name=\"cna\">{{cite web|title=St. Columbanus |work=Catholic News Agency |date= |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=716 |accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref> In 590, Columbanus obtained from King Gontram the Gallo-Roman castle called ''Luxovium'' in present-day [[Luxeuil-les-Bains]], some eight miles from Annegray.<ref name=jonas-17>Jonas 643, p. 17.</ref> The castle, soon transformed into a monastery, was located in a wild region, thickly covered with pine forests and brushwood. Columbanus erected a third monastery called ''Ad-fontanas'' at present-day [[Fontaine-l\u00e8s-Luxeuil]], named for its numerous springs.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/><ref name=jonas-17/> These monastic communities remained under Columbanus' authority, and their rules of life reflected the Irish tradition in which he had been formed. As these communities expanded and drew more pilgrims, Columbanus sought greater solitude, spending periods of time in a hermitage and communicating with the monks through an intermediary. Often he would withdraw to a cave seven miles away, with a single companion who acted as messenger between himself and his companions.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/><ref name=\"cna\"/><ref name=jonas-17/>\n\nDuring his twenty years in [[Gaul]] (in present-day France), Columbanus became involved in a dispute with the Frankish bishops who may have feared his growing influence. During the first half of the sixth century, the councils of Gaul had given to bishops absolute authority over religious communities. As heirs to the Irish monastic tradition, Columbanus and his monks used the Irish Easter calculation, a version of [[Bishop Augustalis]]'s 84-year ''[[computus]]'' for determining the date of Easter ([[Quartodecimanism]]), whereas the [[Franks]] had adopted the [[Victorius of Aquitaine|Victorian]] cycle of 532 years. The bishops objected to the newcomers' continued observance of their own dating, which\u2014among other issues\u2014caused the end of [[Lent]] to differ. They also complained about the distinct [[Celtic Christianity#Monastic tonsure|Irish tonsure]]. In 602, the bishops assembled to judge Columbanus, but he did not appear before them as requested. Instead, he sent a letter to the prelates\u2014a strange mixture of freedom, reverence, and charity\u2014admonishing them to hold synods more frequently, and advising them to pay more attention to matters of equal importance to that of the date of Easter. In defence of his following his traditional paschal cycle, he wrote:\n{{quote|I am not the author of this divergence. I came as a poor stranger into these parts for the cause of Christ, Our Saviour. One thing alone I ask of you, holy Fathers, permit me to live in silence in these forests, near the bones of seventeen of my brethren now dead.<ref name=\"smith\"/>}}\nWhen the bishops refused to abandon the matter, Columbanus, following Saint Patrick's canon, appealed directly to [[Pope Gregory I]]. In the third and only surviving letter, he asks \"the holy Pope, his Father\" to provide \"the strong support of his authority\" and to render a \"verdict of his favour\", apologising for \"presuming to argue as it were, with him who sits in the chair of Peter, Apostle and Bearer of the Keys\". None of the letters were answered, most likely due to the pope's death in 604.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Columbanus then sent a letter to Gregory's successor, [[Pope Boniface IV]], asking him to confirm the tradition of his elders\u2014if it is not contrary to the Faith\u2014so that he and his monks can follow the rites of their ancestors. Before Boniface responded, Columbanus moved outside the jurisdiction of the Frankish bishops. Since the Easter issue appears to end around that time, Columbanus may have stopped celebrating Irish date of Easter after moving to Italy.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>{{refn|The Italians themselves followed a third system of reckoning Easter, based on the improvements to Victorius's system introduced by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] at the time he devised the [[Anno Domini]] dating system.<ref>Blackburn 1999, p. 767.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nColumbanus was also involved in a dispute with members of the Frankish royal family. Upon the death of King Gontram of Burgundy, the succession passed to his nephew, [[Childebert II]], the son of his brother [[Sigebert I|Sigebert]] and Sigebert's wife [[Brunhilda of Austrasia]]. When Childebert II died, he left two sons, [[Theuderic II]] who inherited the Kingdom of [[Burgundy]], and [[Theudebert II]] who inherited the Kingdom of [[Austrasia]]. Since both were minors, Brunhilda, their grandmother, declared herself their guardian and controlled the governments of the two kingdoms.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\nTheuderic II venerated Columbanus and often visited him, but the saint admonished and rebuked him for his behaviour.  When Theuderic began living with a mistress, the saint objected, earning the displeasure of Brunhilda, who thought a royal marriage would threaten her own power.<ref name=\"cna\"/> The saint did not spare the demoralised court, and Brunhilda became his bitterest foe.<ref name=\"cusack\">Cusack 2002, p. 173.</ref> Angered by the saint's moral stand, Brunhilda stirred up the bishops and nobles to find fault with his monastic rules. When Theuderic II finally confronted Columbanus at Luxeuil, ordering him to conform to the country's conventions, the saint refused and was then taken prisoner to [[Free Imperial City of Besan\u00e7on|Besan\u00e7on]]. Columbanus managed to escape his captors and returned to his monastery at Luxeuil. When the king and his grandmother found out, they sent soldiers to drive him back to Ireland by force, separating him from his monks by insisting that only those from Ireland could accompany him into exile.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\nColumbanus was taken to [[Nevers]], then travelled by boat down the [[Loire]] river to the coast. At [[Tours]] he visited the tomb of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]], and sent a message to Theuderic II indicating that within three years he and his children would perish. When he arrived at [[Nantes]], he wrote a letter before embarkation to his fellow monks at Luxeuil monastery. Filled with love and affection, the letter urges his brethren to obey [[Saint Attala|Attala]], who stayed behind as abbot of the monastic community.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> The letter concludes:\n{{quote|They come to tell me the ship is ready. The end of my parchment compels me to finish my letter. Love is not orderly; it is this which has made it confused. Farewell, dear hearts of mine; pray for me that I may live in God.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>}}\nSoon after the ship set sail from Nantes, a severe storm drove the vessel back ashore. Convinced that his holy passenger caused the tempest, the captain refused further attempts to transport the monk. Columbanus made his way across Gaul to visit King [[Chlothar II]] of Neustria at [[Soissons]] where he was gladly received. Despite the king's offers to stay in his kingdom, Columbanus left Neustria in 611 for the court of King [[Theudebert II]] of [[Austrasia]] in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian Franks]].<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\n===The Alps===\nColumbanus travelled to [[Metz]], where he received an honourable welcome, and then proceeding to [[Mainz]], where he sailed upwards the [[Rhine]] river to the lands of the [[Suebi]] and [[Alemanni]] in the northern Alps, intending to preach the Gospel to these people. He followed the Rhine river and its tributaries, the [[Aar]] and the [[Limmat]], and then on to [[Lake Zurich]]. Columbanus chose the village of [[Tuggen]] as his initial community, but the work was not successful.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> He continued north-east by way of Arbon to [[Bregenz]] on [[Lake Constance]]. Here the saint found an [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] dedicated to Saint Aurelia containing three brass images of their tutelary deities. Columbanus commanded [[Saint Gall|Gallus]], who knew the local language, to preach to the inhabitants, and many were converted. The three brass images were destroyed, and Columbanus blessed the little church, placing the relics of Saint Aurelia beneath the altar. A monastery was erected, [[Wettingen-Mehrerau Abbey|Mehrerau Abbey]], and the brethren observed their regular life. Columbanus stayed in Bregenz for about one year.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Following an uprising against the community, possibly related to that region being taken over by the saint's old enemy King Theuderic II, Columbanus resolved to cross the Alps into Italy.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Gallus remained in this area and died there 646.

On his first journey, Columbanus went to Rome and received from Pope Gregory I sacred relics.<ref name=\"stokes\">Stokes 2007, p. 132</ref> This may possibly explain the traditional spot in St. Peter's, where Pope Gregory I and Columbanus are supposed to have met.<ref name=\"moran\">Moran 2010, p. 105</ref>|group=Note}} He immediately began refuting the teachings of [[Arianism]], which had enjoyed a degree of acceptance in Italy. He wrote a treatise against Arianism, which has since been lost. Queen Theodelinda, the devout daughter of Duke [[Garibald I of Bavaria]], played an important role in restoring [[Nicene Christianity]] to a position of primacy against Arianism, and was largely responsible for the king's conversion to Christianity.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\nAt the king's request, Columbanus wrote a letter to [[Pope Boniface IV]] on the controversy over the ''[[Three-Chapter Controversy|Three Chapters]]''\u2014writings by Syrian bishops suspected of [[Nestorianism]], which had been condemned in the fifth century as [[heresy]]. [[Pope Gregory I]] had tolerated in Lombardy those persons who defended the ''Three Letters'', among them King Agilulf. Columbanus agreed to take up the issue on behalf of the king. The letter begins with an apology that a \"foolish Scot (''Scottus'', Irishman)\" would be writing for a Lombard king. After acquainting the pope with the imputations brought against him, he entreats the pontiff to prove his orthodoxy and assemble a council. He writes that his freedom of speech is consistent with the custom of his country.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Some of the language used in the letter might now be regarded as disrespectful, but in that time, faith and austerity could be more indulgent.<ref name=\"montalembert-440\">Montalembert 1861, p. 440.</ref> At the same time, the letter expresses the most affectionate and impassioned devotion to the Holy See.\n{{quote|We Irish, though dwelling at the far ends of the earth, are all disciples of Saint Peter and Saint Paul ... we are bound to the Chair of Peter, and although Rome is great and renowned, through that Chair alone is she looked on as great and illustrious among us ... On account of the two Apostles of Christ, you are almost celestial, and Rome is the head of the whole world, and of the Churches.}}\nIf Columbanus' zeal for orthodoxy caused him to overstep the limits of discretion, his real attitude towards Rome is sufficiently clear, calling the pope \"his Lord and Father in Christ\", the \"Chosen Watchman\", and the \"First Pastor, set higher than all mortals\".<ref name=\"allnatt\">Allnatt 2007, p. 105.</ref>\n[[File:Bobbio-abbazia di san colombano-esterno6.jpg|thumb|left|Facade of the Abbey in Bobbio]]\nKing Agilulf gave Columbanus a tract of land called [[Bobbio]] between Milan and Genoa near the [[Trebbia]] river, situated in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] of the [[Apennine Mountains]], to be used as a base for the conversion of the Lombard people. The area contained a ruined church and wastelands known as ''Ebovium'', which had formed part of the lands of the papacy prior to the Lombard invasion. Columbanus wanted this secluded place, for while enthusiastic in the instruction of the Lombards he preferred solitude for his monks and himself. Next to the little church, which was dedicated to [[Saint Peter]], Columbanus erected a monastery in 614. [[Bobbio Abbey]] at its foundation followed the Rule of Saint Columbanus, based on the monastic practices of [[Celtic Christianity]]. For centuries it remained the stronghold of orthodoxy in northern Italy.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>{{refn|Bobbio Abbey may have been the model for the monastery in northern Italy in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]''.|group=Note}}\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:Bobbio bridge.jpg|thumb|Stone bridge over the Trebbia river leading to [[Bobbio Abbey]] in northern Italy]]\nDuring the last year of his life, Columbanus received messenges from King [[Chlothar II]], inviting the saint to return to Burgundy, now that his enemies were dead. Columbanus did not return, but requested that the king should always protect his monks at [[Luxeuil Abbey]]. He prepared for death by retiring to his cave on the mountainside overlooking the Trebbia river, where, according to a tradition, he had dedicated an oratory to Our Lady.<ref name=\"montalembert-444\">Montalembert 1861, p. 444.</ref> Columbanus died at Bobbio on 21 November 615.\n\n==Rule of Saint Columbanus==\nThe Rule of Saint Columbanus embodied the customs of [[Bangor Abbey]] and other Irish monasteries. Much shorter than the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], the Rule of Saint Columbanus consists of ten chapters, on the subjects of obedience, silence, food, poverty, humility, chastity, choir offices, discretion, mortification, and perfection.<ref name=\"ucc\">{{cite web|author=Columbanus Hibernus |editor-last=Walker |editor-first=G.S.M. |title=Monk's Rules |work=Corpus of Electronic Texts |publisher=University College Cork |date= |url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/T201052.html |accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the first chapter, Columbanus introduces the great principle of his Rule: obedience, absolute and unreserved. The words of seniors should always be obeyed, just as \"Christ obeyed the Father up to death for us.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> One manifestation of this obedience was constant hard labour designed to subdue the flesh, exercise the will in daily self-denial, and set an example of industry in cultivation of the soil. The least deviation from the Rule entailed corporal punishment, or a severe form of fasting.<ref name=\"smith\"/> In the second chapter, Columbanus instructs that the rule of silence be \"carefully observed\", since it is written: \"But the nurture of righteousness is silence and peace\". He also warns, \"Justly will they be damned who would not say just things when they could, but preferred to say with garrulous loquacity what is evil ...\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> In the third chapter, Columbanus instructs, \"Let the monks' food be poor and taken in the evening, such as to avoid repletion, and their drink such as to avoid intoxication, so that it may both maintain life and not harm ...\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> Columbanus continues:\n{{quote|For indeed those who desire eternal rewards must only consider usefulness and use. Use of life must be moderated just as toil must be moderated, since this is true discretion, that the possibility of spiritual progress may be kept with a temperance that punishes the flesh. For if temperance exceeds measure, it will be a vice and not a virtue; for virtue maintains and retains many goods. Therefore we must fast daily, just as we must feed daily; and while we must eat daily, we must gratify the body more poorly and sparingly ...\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/>}}\n\n[[Image:Columbanus at Bobbio.jpg|thumb|upright|Fresco of Saint Columbanus in [[Brugnato Cathedral]]]]\nIn the fourth chapter, Columbanus presents the virtue of poverty and of overcoming greed, and that monks should be satisfied with \"small possessions of utter need, knowing that greed is a leprosy for monks\". Columbanus also instructs that \"nakedness and disdain of riches are the first perfection of monks, but the second is the purging of vices, the third the most perfect and perpetual love of God and unceasing affection for things divine, which follows on the forgetfulness of earthly things. Since this is so, we have need of few things, according to the word of the Lord, or even of one.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> In the fifth chapter, Columbanus warns against vanity, reminding the monks of Jesus' warning in Luke 16:15: \"You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> In the sixth chapter, Columbanus instructs that \"a monk's chastity is indeed judged in his thoughts\" and warns, \"What profit is it if he be virgin in body, if he be not virgin in mind? For God, being Spirit.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/>\n\nIn the seventh chapter, Columbanus instituted a service of perpetual prayer, known as ''[[laus perennis]]'', by which choir succeeded choir, both day and night.<ref name=\"montalembert-405\">Montalembert 1898, II p. 405.</ref> In the eighth chapter, Columbanus stresses the importance of discretion in the lives of monks to avoid \"the downfall of some, who beginning without discretion and passing their time without a sobering knowledge, have been unable to complete a praiseworthy life.\" Monks are instructed to pray to God for to \"illumine this way, surrounded on every side by the world's thickest darkness\".<ref name=\"ucc\"/> Columbanus continues: \n{{quote|So discretion has got its name from discerning, for the reason that it discerns in us between good and evil, and also between the moderate and the complete. For from the beginning either class has been divided like light and darkness, that is, good and evil, after evil began through the devil's agency to exist by the corruption of good, but through God's agency Who first illumines and then divides. Thus righteous Abel chose the good, but unrighteous Cain fell upon evil.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/>}}\n\nIn the ninth chapter, Columbanus presents mortification as an essential element in the lives of monks, who are instructed, \"Do nothing without counsel.\" Monks are warned to \"beware of a proud independence, and learn true lowliness as they obey without murmuring and hesitation.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/> According to the Rule, there are three components to mortification: \"not to disagree in mind, not to speak as one pleases with the tongue, not to go anywhere with complete freedom.\" This mirrors the words of Jesus, \"For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.\" (John 6:38) In the tenth and final chapter, Columbanus regulates forms of [[penance]] (often corporal) for offences, and it is here that the Rule of Saint Columbanus differs significantly from that of Saint Benedict.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\nThe Communal Rule of Columbanus required monks to fast every day until ''[[Nones (liturgy)|None]]'' or 3 p.m., this was later relaxed and observed on designated days.<ref name=\"Frantzen 2014\">Frantzen, Allen J. (2014). ''Food, Eating and Identity in Early Medieval England''. The Boydell Press. p. 184. {{ISBN|978-1-84383-908-8}}</ref> Columbanus' Rule regarding diet was very strict. Monks were to eat a limited diet of beans, vegetables, flour mixed with water and small bread of a loaf, taken in the evenings.<ref name=\"Frantzen 2014\"/><ref>O'Hara, Alexander. (2018). ''Jonas of Bobbio and the Legacy of Columbanus''. Oxford University Press. p. 59. {{ISBN|978-0-19-085800-1}}</ref>\n\nThe habit of the monks consisted of a tunic of undyed wool, over which was worn the [[cuculla]], or cowl, of the same material. A great deal of time was devoted to various kinds of [[manual labour]], not unlike the life in monasteries of other rules. The Rule of Saint Columbanus was approved of by the [[Fourth Council of M\u00e2con]] in 627, but it was superseded at the close of the century by the Rule of Saint Benedict. For several centuries in some of the greater monasteries the two rules were observed conjointly.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\n==Character==\nColumbanus did not lead a perfect life. According to Jonas and other sources, he could be impetuous and even headstrong, for by nature he was eager, passionate, and dauntless. These qualities were both the source of his power and the cause of his mistakes.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> His virtues, however, were quite remarkable. Like many saints, he had a great love for God's creatures. Stories claim that as he walked in the woods, it was not uncommon for birds to land on his shoulders to be caressed, or for squirrels to run down from the trees and nestle in the folds of his cowl.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> Although a strong defender of Irish traditions, he never wavered in showing deep respect for the Holy See as the supreme authority. His influence in Europe was due to the conversions he effected and to the rule that he composed. It may be that the example and success of Saint [[Columba]] in Caledonia inspired him to similar exertions.<ref name=\"edmonds\"/> The life of Columbanus stands as the prototype of missionary activity in Europe, followed by such men as [[Saint Kilian]], [[Vergilius of Salzburg]], [[Donatus of Fiesole]], [[Wilfrid]], [[Willibrord]], [[Suitbert of Kaiserwerdt]], [[Saint Boniface]], and [[Ursicinus of Saint-Ursanne]].<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n\n==Miracles==\nThe following are the principal miracles attributed to his intercession:<ref name=\"edmonds\"/>\n# Procuring food for a sick monk and curing the wife of his benefactor\n# Escaping injury while surrounded by wolves\n# Causing a bear to evacuate a cave at his biddings\n# Producing a spring of water near his cave\n# Replenishing the Luxeuil granary\n# Multiplying bread and beer for his community\n# Curing sick monks, who rose from their beds at his request to reap the harvest\n# Giving sight to a blind man at Orleans\n# Destroying with his breath a cauldron of beer prepared for a pagan festival\n# Taming a bear and yoking it to a plough\n\nJonas relates the occurrence of a miracle during Columbanus' time in Bregenz, when that region was experiencing a period of severe famine.\n{{quote|Although they were without food, they were bold and unterrified in their faith, so that they obtained food from the Lord. After their bodies had been exhausted by three days of fasting, they found so great an abundance of birds, just as the quails formerly covered the camp of the children of Israel, that the whole country near there was filled with birds. The man of God knew that this food had been scattered on the ground for his own safety and that of his brethren, and that the birds had come only because he was there. He ordered his followers first to render grateful praises to the Creator, and then to take the birds as food. And it was a wonderful and stupendous miracle; for the birds were seized according to the father's commands and did not attempt to fly away. The manna of birds remained for three days. On the fourth day, a priest from an adjacent city, warned by divine inspiration, sent a supply of grain to Saint Columban. When the supply of grain arrived, the Omnipotent, who had furnished the winged food to those in want, immediately commanded the phalanxes of birds to depart. We learned this from Eustasius, who was present with the others, under the command of the servant of God. He said that no one of them remembered ever having seen birds of such a kind before; and the food was of so pleasant savor that it surpassed royal viands.

The association also owns and protects the site containing the cave, which acted as Columbanus' cell, and the holy well, which he created nearby.<ref name=\"mi\"/> At [[Luxeuil-les-Bains]], the Basilica of Saint Peter stands on the site of Columbanus' first church. A statue near the entrance, unveiled in 1947, shows him denouncing the immoral life of King [[Theuderic II]]. Formally an abbey church, the basilica contains old monastic buildings, which have been used as a minor seminary since the nineteenth century.

The sacristy at Bobbio possesses a portion of the skull of the saint, his knife, wooden cup, bell, and an ancient water vessel, formerly containing sacred relics and said to have been given to him by [[Pope Gregory I]].

Since then, the Elephant has been a famous part of the Carlsberg family, especially after the strong Elephant Beer was created in 1955 under the name Export Lager Beer featuring the Elephant label. The Elephant is still brewed in Carlsberg Breweries in Copenhagen and exported around the world.

In May 1951 two crates were delivered to Churchill's London home. In a thank-you letter Churchill called the drink \"Commemoration Lager\". In Denmark the drink was called {{lang|da|P\u00e5skebryg}}&nbsp;(\"Easter Brew\"), but the Easter Brew has since been replaced by a weaker beer ({{lang|da|Carls P\u00e5ske}}). For the British market Carlsberg called the drink Special Brew, and production was started in [[Northampton]] in the 1950s.\n\nAt 7.5% alcohol (previously 9%, then 8% for a short time), Special Brew is part of a group of strong lagers that are termed \"super-strength\" in the UK and [[malt liquor]] in the USA. This beer is often associated with street alcoholics.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/oct/03/drugsandalcohol.homelessness | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Matthew | last=Weaver | title=Call for ban on super-strength 'tramp juice' | date=3 October 2005}}</ref>\n\nA single can (440mL) of Special Brew contains 3.5 [[Unit of alcohol|units of alcohol]] (previously 4.5 units) whilst the maximum recommended daily intake for a man is two units.

The change, a reduction either in the size of the can from 500mL to 440mL, or the alcoholic strength of the beer, was considered for implementation in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-30795336 |title=The secret history of Special Brew |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref> Both changes were made; the cans have since been reduced to 440 mL, and the ABV reduced from 9% to 8%, then another drop to 7.5%.\n\n=== Elephant beer ===\n[[Image:Elefantporten (Carlsberg).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Elephant Gate and Tower, Carlsberg|Elephant Gate]] in Copenhagen, Denmark]] \n[[Image:Carlsberg Elephant Beer.jpg|thumb|upright|50px|Elephant beer]]\nIn 1901, at brewer Carl Jacobsen's initiative, the Architect Professor J.

It is defined by the [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) mutations, or UEPs, M1(YAP), M145(P205), M203, P144, P153, P165, P167, P183.<ref>[http://www.isogg.org/tree/ISOGG_YDNATreeTrunk08.html ISOGG reference webpage.]</ref> DE is unique because it is distributed in several geographically distinct clusters. An immediate subclade, haplogroup [[Haplogroup D (Y-DNA)|D]] (also known as D-CTS3946), is mainly found in Eastern [[Asia]], parts of Central Asia, and the [[Andaman Islands]], but also sporadically in [[West Africa]] and [[West Asia]]. The other immediate subclade, haplogroup [[Haplogroup E (Y-DNA)|E]], is common in [[Africa]], and to a lesser extent the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]].\n\nThe most well-known [[unique event polymorphism]] (UEP) that defines DE is the '''Y-chromosome Alu [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphism]]''' \"YAP''\"''. The mutation was caused when a strand of DNA, known as [[Alu sequence|Alu]], inserted a copy of itself into the [[Y chromosome]]. Hence, all Y chromosomes belonging to DE, D, E and their subclades are YAP-positive (YAP+). All Y chromosomes that belong to other haplogroups and subclades are YAP-negative (YAP-).\n\nThe age of haplogroup DE, previously estimated at between 65,000 and 71,000 years,<ref name=Karafet>{{cite journal | vauthors = Karafet TM, Mendez FL, Meilerman MB, Underhill PA, Zegura SL, Hammer MF | title = New binary polymorphisms reshape and increase resolution of the human Y chromosomal haplogroup tree | journal = Genome Research | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 830\u20138 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18385274 | pmc = 2336805 | doi = 10.1101/gr.7172008 }}</ref> was later estimated at around 73,000 years <ref name=\"A recent bottleneck of Y chromosome\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamin M, Saag L, Vincente M, et al. | title = A recent bottleneck of Y chromosome diversity coincides with a global change in culture\n | journal = Genome Research | volume = 25\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 459\u2013466\n | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25770088 | pmc = 4381518\n | doi = 10.1101/gr.186684.114 }}</ref> and most recently at around 76,000 years old.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" />\n\n==Distribution==\nThe subclades of DE continue to confound investigators trying to reconstruct the migration of humans because, while they are common in Africa and East Asia, they are also largely absent between these two regions.

Haplogroup D, which is YAP positive, was clearly an Asian lineage, being found only in East Asia with high frequencies in the Andaman Islands, Japan and Tibet. Because the mutations that define haplogroup E were observed to be in the ancestral state in haplogroup D, and haplogroup D at 55kya, was considerably older than haplogroup E at 31kya, Hammer concluded that haplogroup E was a subclade of haplogroup D and migrated back to Africa.<ref name=\"hammer1998\"/>\n\nA 2000 study concerning the origin of the YAP+ mutation analyzed 841 Y-chromosomes representing 36 human populations of wide geographical distribution for the presence of a Y-specific Alu insert (YAP+ chromosomes). They also analyzed the Out-of-Africa and out-of-Asia models for the YAP mutations. According to the authors, the most ancient YAP+ mutation was found in the Asian lineage of Tibetans, but curiously not in Japanese lineages. More recent YAP+ lineages were distributed almost equally in Asians and Africans, with a smaller distribution in Europe. The scientists concluded that the information available did not allow one to decide between the out-of-Asia or out-of-Africa models. They further suggested that the YAP+ mutation had already originated 141,000 years ago.<ref>Origin of YAP+ lineages of the human Y\u2010chromosome - M.

The authors consider other possible scenarios, but conclude in favor of a model involving an African origin of hapologroup DE, with haplogroups E and D0 also originating in Africa, along with the migration out of Africa of the three lineages (C, D and FT) that now form the vast majority of non-African Y chromosomes. The authors find divergence times for DE*, E, and D0, all likely within a period of about 76,000-71,000 years ago, and a likely date for the exit of the ancestors of modern Eurasians out of Africa (and ensuing Neanderthal admixture) later around 50,300-59,400 years ago, which they argue, also supports an African origin for those haplogroups.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n[[FTDNA]], in 2019, found three other D0 samples: one in Syria (the most basal sample of D0 found to date, diverging about 26,000 years ago), and two in Saudi Arabia.

According to their schematics D0 can be grouped into an Asian cluster (West Asia) and African cluster (Nigeria). Two D0 branches were confirmed: D-FT75 found in West Asia and D-FT76 found in West Asia and West Africa. \"D0\" has also been alternately named \"D2\", and former D (D-M174) has now been termed \"D1\", since the discovery of D0.

Haplogroup D, which is YAP positive, was clearly an Asian lineage, being found only in East Asia with high frequencies in the Andaman Islands, Japan and Tibet. Because the mutations that define haplogroup E were observed to be in the ancestral state in haplogroup D, and haplogroup D at 55kya, was considerably older than haplogroup E at 31kya, Hammer concluded that haplogroup E was a subclade of haplogroup D and migrated back to Africa.<ref name=\"hammer1998\"/>\n\nA 2000 study concerning the origin of the YAP+ mutation analyzed 841 Y-chromosomes representing 36 human populations of wide geographical distribution for the presence of a Y-specific Alu insert (YAP+ chromosomes). They also analyzed the Out-of-Africa and out-of-Asia models for the YAP mutations. According to the authors, the most ancient YAP+ mutation was found in the Asian lineage of Tibetans, but curiously not in Japanese lineages. More recent YAP+ lineages were distributed almost equally in Asians and Africans, with a smaller distribution in Europe. The scientists concluded that the information available did not allow one to decide between the out-of-Asia or out-of-Africa models. They further suggested that the YAP+ mutation had already originated 141,000 years ago.<ref>Origin of YAP+ lineages of the human Y\u2010chromosome - M.

The authors find divergence times for DE*, E, and D0, all likely within a period of about 76,000-71,000 years ago, and a likely date for the exit of the ancestors of modern Eurasians out of Africa (and ensuing Neanderthal admixture) later around 50,300-59,400 years ago, which they argue, also supports an African origin for those haplogroups.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n[[FTDNA]], in 2019, found three other D0 samples: one in Syria (the most basal sample of D0 found to date, diverging about 26,000 years ago), and two in Saudi Arabia.

The heaviest of the stable [[halogen]]s, it exists as a lustrous, purple-black non-metallic solid at [[standard condition]]s that melts to form a deep violet liquid at 114 degrees [[Celsius]], and boils to a violet gas at 184 degrees Celsius. However, it [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimes]] easily with gentle heat, resulting in a widespread misconception even taught in some science textbooks that it does not melt. The element was discovered by the French chemist [[Bernard Courtois]] in 1811. It was named two years later by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]], after the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u1f30\u03ce\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2'' \"violet-coloured\".\n\nIodine occurs in many oxidation states, including [[iodide]] (I<sup>\u2212</sup>), [[iodate]] ({{chem|IO|3|-}}), and the various [[periodate]] anions.

Iodine has an electron configuration of [Kr]4d<sup>10</sup>5s<sup>2</sup>5p<sup>5</sup>, with the seven electrons in the fifth and outermost shell being its [[valence electron]]s. Like the other halogens, it is one electron short of a full octet and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell, although in keeping with [[periodic trend]]s, it is the weakest oxidising agent among the stable halogens: it has the lowest [[electronegativity]] among them, just 2.66 on the Pauling scale (compare fluorine, chlorine, and bromine at 3.98, 3.16, and 2.96 respectively; astatine continues the trend with an electronegativity of 2.2). Elemental iodine hence forms [[diatomic molecule]]s with chemical formula I<sub>2</sub>, where two iodine atoms share a pair of electrons in order to each achieve a stable octet for themselves; at high temperatures, these diatomic molecules reversibly dissociate a pair of iodine atoms. Similarly, the iodide anion, I<sup>\u2212</sup>, is the strongest reducing agent among the stable halogens, being the most easily oxidised back to diatomic I<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=Greenwood800>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 800\u20134</ref> (Astatine goes further, being indeed unstable as At<sup>\u2212</sup> and readily oxidised to At<sup>0</sup> or At<sup>+</sup>, although the existence of At<sub>2</sub> is not settled.)<ref>{{cite book | series = Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic and Organometallic Chemistry | title = 'At, Astatine', System No. 8a | edition=8th | year = 1985 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | isbn = 978-3-540-93516-2 | last1 = Kugler | first1 = H.

Iodine conforms to the prevailing trend, being a shiny black crystalline solid that melts at 114&nbsp;\u00b0C and boils at 183&nbsp;\u00b0C to form a violet gas. This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group (though astatine may not conform to it, depending on how metallic it turns out to be).<ref name=Greenwood800/> Specifically, the violet colour of iodine gas results from the [[atomic electron transition|electron transition]] between the [[HOMO/LUMO|highest occupied]] antibonding ''\u03c0<sub>g</sub>'' molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding ''\u03c3<sub>u</sub>'' molecular orbital.<ref name=Greenwood804>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 804\u20139</ref>\n\nElemental iodine is slightly soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450&nbsp;ml at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1280&nbsp;ml at 50&nbsp;\u00b0C; [[potassium iodide]] may be added to increase solubility via formation of [[triiodide]] ions, among other polyiodides.<ref name=Greenwood804/> Nonpolar solvents such as [[hexane]] and [[carbon tetrachloride]] provide a higher solubility.<ref>{{cite book| title = Merck Index of Chemicals and Drugs| edition = 9th| date = 1976| isbn=978-0-911910-26-1| editor = Windholz, Martha| editor2 = Budavari, Susan| editor3 = Stroumtsos, Lorraine Y.| editor4 = Fertig, Margaret Noether| publisher = J A Majors Company}}</ref> Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as [[Lewis base]]s; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour.<ref name=Greenwood804/> [[Charge-transfer complex]]es form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour.

For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitric oxide]], and [[sulfur dioxide]] (to [[phosgene]], [[nitrosyl chloride]], and [[sulfuryl chloride]] respectively), iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, [[rhenium]] metal reacts with chlorine to form [[rhenium hexachloride]], but with bromine it forms only [[rhenium pentabromide]] and iodine can achieve only [[rhenium tetraiodide]].<ref name=Greenwood800/> By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in [[iodine heptafluoride]].<ref name=Greenwood804/>\n\nI<sub>2</sub> dissociates in light with an absorbance at 578&nbsp;nm wavelength.\n\n===Iodine value===\nThe [[iodine value]] is the mass of iodine in grams that is consumed by 100 grams of a [[chemical substance]]. Iodine numbers are often used to determine the amount of unsaturation in [[fatty acid]]s. This unsaturation is in the form of [[double bond]]s, which react with iodine compounds.

It is a colourless gas that reacts with oxygen to give water and iodine. Although it is useful in [[iodination]] reactions in the laboratory, it does not have large-scale industrial uses, unlike the other hydrogen halides. Commercially, it is usually made by reacting iodine with [[hydrogen sulfide]] or [[hydrazine]]:<ref name=Greenwood809>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 809\u201312</ref>\n:2 I<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> {{overset|H<sub>2</sub>O|\u27f6}} 4 HI + N<sub>2</sub>\nAt room temperature, it is a colourless gas, like all of the hydrogen halides except [[hydrogen fluoride]], since hydrogen cannot form strong [[hydrogen bond]]s to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at \u221251.0&nbsp;\u00b0C and boils at \u221235.1&nbsp;\u00b0C. It is an [[endothermic]] compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a [[catalyst]] is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H\u2013I [[bond dissociation energy]] is likewise the smallest of the hydrogen halides, at 295&nbsp;kJ/mol.<ref name=Greenwood812>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 812\u20139</ref>\n\nAqueous hydrogen iodide is known as [[hydroiodic acid]], which is a strong acid. Hydrogen iodide is exceptionally soluble in water: one litre of water will dissolve 425 litres of hydrogen iodide, and the saturated solution has only four water molecules per molecule of hydrogen iodide.<ref>Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. \"Inorganic Chemistry\" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.</ref> Commercial so-called \"concentrated\" hydroiodic acid usually contains 48\u201357% HI by mass; the solution forms an [[azeotrope]] with boiling point 126.7&nbsp;\u00b0C at 56.7&nbsp;g HI per 100&nbsp;g solution. Hence hydroiodic acid cannot be concentrated past this point by evaporation of water.<ref name=Greenwood812/>\n\nUnlike [[hydrogen fluoride]], anhydrous liquid hydrogen iodide is difficult to work with as a solvent, because its boiling point is low, it has a small liquid range, its [[dielectric constant]] is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into H<sub>2</sub>I<sup>+</sup> and {{chem|HI|2|-}} ions \u2013 the latter, in any case, are much less stable than the [[bifluoride]] ions ({{chem|HF|2|-}}) due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and iodine, though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as [[caesium|Cs<sup>+</sup>]] and [[quaternary ammonium cation|{{chem|NR|4|+}}]] (R = [[methyl group|Me]], [[ethyl group|Et]], [[butyl group|Bu<sup>''n''</sup>]]) may still be isolated. Anhydrous hydrogen iodide is a poor solvent, able to dissolve only small molecular compounds such as [[nitrosyl chloride]] and [[phenol]], or salts with very low [[Lattice energy|lattice energies]] such as tetraalkylammonium halides.<ref name=Greenwood812/>\n\n===Other binary iodides===\nNearly all elements in the periodic table form binary iodides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the [[noble gas]]es); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond [[bismuth]]); and having an electronegativity higher than iodine's ([[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], and the first three halogens), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not iodides but rather oxides, nitrides, or halides of iodine. (Nonetheless, [[nitrogen triiodide]] is named as an iodide as it is analogous to the other nitrogen trihalides.)<ref name=Greenwood821/>\n\nGiven the large size of the iodide anion and iodine's weak oxidising power, high oxidation states are difficult to achieve in binary iodides, the maximum known being in the pentaiodides of [[niobium]], [[tantalum]], and [[protactinium]]. Iodides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydroiodic acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen iodide gas. These methods work best when the iodide product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative iodination of the element with iodine or hydrogen iodide, high-temperature iodination of a metal oxide or other halide by iodine, a volatile metal halide, [[carbon tetraiodide]], or an organic iodide. For example, [[molybdenum(IV) oxide]] reacts with [[aluminium(III) iodide]] at 230&nbsp;\u00b0C to give [[molybdenum(II) iodide]]. An example involving halogen exchange is given below, involving the reaction of [[tantalum(V) chloride]] with excess aluminium(III) iodide at 400&nbsp;\u00b0C to give [[tantalum(V) iodide]]:<ref name=Greenwood821>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 821\u20134</ref>\n\n: <chem>3TaCl5 + \\underset{(excess)}{5AlI3} -> 3TaI5 + 5AlCl3</chem>\n\nLower iodides may be produced either through thermal decomposition or disproportionation, or by reducing the higher iodide with hydrogen or a metal, for example:<ref name=Greenwood821/>\n\n: <chem>TaI5{} + Ta ->[\\text{thermal gradient}] [\\ce{630^\\circ C\\ ->\\ 575^\\circ C}] Ta6I14</chem>\n\nMost of the iodides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, along with the [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular iodides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Ionic iodides MI<sub>''n''</sub> tend to have the lowest melting and boiling points among the halides MX<sub>''n''</sub> of the same element, because the electrostatic forces of attraction between the cations and anions are weakest for the large iodide anion. In contrast, covalent iodides tend to instead have the highest melting and boiling points among the halides of the same element, since iodine is the most polarisable of the halogens and, having the most electrons among them, can contribute the most to van der Waals forces. Naturally, exceptions abound in intermediate iodides where one trend gives way to the other. Similarly, solubilities in water of predominantly ionic iodides (e.g. [[potassium]] and [[calcium]]) are the greatest among ionic halides of that element, while those of covalent iodides (e.g. [[silver]]) are the lowest of that element. In particular, [[silver iodide]] is very insoluble in water and its formation is often used as a qualitative test for iodine.<ref name=Greenwood821/>\n\n===Iodine halides===\nThe halogens form many binary, [[diamagnetic]] [[interhalogen]] compounds with stoichiometries XY, XY<sub>3</sub>, XY<sub>5</sub>, and XY<sub>7</sub> (where X is heavier than Y), and iodine is no exception. Iodine forms all three possible diatomic interhalogens, a trifluoride and trichloride, as well as a pentafluoride and, exceptionally among the halogens, a heptafluoride. Numerous cationic and anionic derivatives are also characterised, such as the wine-red or bright orange compounds of {{chem|ICl|2|+}} and the dark brown or purplish black compounds of I<sub>2</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup>. Apart from these, some [[pseudohalogen|pseudohalides]] are also known, such as [[cyanogen iodide]] (ICN), iodine [[thiocyanate]] (ISCN), and iodine [[azide]] (IN<sub>3</sub>).<ref name=Greenwood824>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 824\u20138</ref>\n\n[[File:Iodine monochloride1.jpg|thumb|right|Iodine monochloride]]\n[[Iodine monofluoride]] (IF) is unstable at room temperature and disproportionates very readily and irreversibly to iodine and [[iodine pentafluoride]], and thus cannot be obtained pure. It can be synthesised from the reaction of iodine with fluorine gas in [[trichlorofluoromethane]] at \u221245&nbsp;\u00b0C, with [[iodine trifluoride]] in trichlorofluoromethane at \u221278&nbsp;\u00b0C, or with [[silver(I) fluoride]] at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=Greenwood824/> [[Iodine monochloride]] (ICl) and [[iodine monobromide]] (IBr), on the other hand, are moderately stable. The former, a volatile red-brown compound, was discovered independently by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Humphry Davy]] in 1813\u20134 not long after the discoveries of chlorine and iodine, and it mimics the intermediate halogen bromine so well that [[Justus von Liebig]] was misled into mistaking bromine (which he had found) for iodine monochloride. Iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide may be prepared simply by reacting iodine with chlorine or bromine at room temperature and purified by [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallisation]]. Both are quite reactive and attack even [[platinum]] and [[gold]], though not [[boron]], [[carbon]], [[cadmium]], [[lead]], [[zirconium]], [[niobium]], [[molybdenum]], and [[tungsten]]. Their reaction with organic compounds depends on conditions. Iodine chloride vapour tends to chlorinate [[phenol]] and [[salicyclic acid]], since when iodine chloride undergoes homolytic dissociation, chlorine and iodine are produced and the former is more reactive. However, iodine chloride in tetrachloromethane solution results in iodination being the main reaction, since now heterolytic fission of the I\u2013Cl bond occurs and I<sup>+</sup> attacks phenol as an electrophile. However, iodine monobromide tends to brominate phenol even in tetrachloromethane solution because it tends to dissociate into its elements in solution, and bromine is more reactive than iodine.<ref name=Greenwood824/> When liquid, iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide dissociate into {{chem|I|2|X|+}} and {{chem|IX|2|-}} anions (X = Cl, Br); thus they are significant conductors of electricity and can be used as ionising solvents.<ref name=Greenwood824/>\n\n[[Iodine trifluoride]] (IF<sub>3</sub>) is an unstable yellow solid that decomposes above \u221228&nbsp;\u00b0C. It is thus little-known. It is difficult to produce because fluorine gas would tend to oxidise iodine all the way to the pentafluoride; reaction at low temperature with [[xenon difluoride]] is necessary. [[Iodine trichloride]], which exists in the solid state as the planar dimer I<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, is a bright yellow solid, synthesised by reacting iodine with liquid chlorine at \u221280&nbsp;\u00b0C; caution is necessary during purification because it easily dissociates to iodine monochloride and chlorine and hence can act as a strong chlorinating agent. Liquid iodine trichloride conducts electricity, possibly indicating dissociation to {{chem|ICl|2|+}} and {{chem|ICl|4|-}} ions.<ref name=Greenwood828>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 828\u201331</ref>\n\n[[Iodine pentafluoride]] (IF<sub>5</sub>), a colourless, volatile liquid, is the most thermodynamically stable iodine fluoride, and can be made by reacting iodine with fluorine gas at room temperature. It is a fluorinating agent, but is mild enough to store in glass apparatus. Again, slight electrical conductivity is present in the liquid state because of dissociation to {{chem|IF|4|+}} and {{chem|IF|6|-}}. The [[pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry|pentagonal bipyramidal]] [[iodine heptafluoride]] (IF<sub>7</sub>) is an extremely powerful fluorinating agent, behind only [[chlorine trifluoride]], [[chlorine pentafluoride]], and [[bromine pentafluoride]] among the interhalogens: it reacts with almost all the elements even at low temperatures, fluorinates [[Pyrex]] glass to form iodine(VII) oxyfluoride (IOF<sub>5</sub>), and sets carbon monoxide on fire.<ref name=Greenwood832>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 832\u20135</ref>\n\n===Iodine oxides and oxoacids===\n[[File:Iodine-pentoxide-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Structure of iodine pentoxide]]\n[[Iodine oxide]]s are the most stable of all the halogen oxides, because of the strong I\u2013O bonds resulting from the large electronegativity difference between iodine and oxygen, and they have been known for the longest time.<ref name=King/> The stable, white, [[hygroscopic]] [[iodine pentoxide]] (I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) has been known since its formation in 1813 by Gay-Lussac and Davy. It is most easily made by the dehydration of [[iodic acid]] (HIO<sub>3</sub>), of which it is the anhydride. It will quickly oxidise carbon monoxide completely to [[carbon dioxide]] at room temperature, and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration. It also oxidises nitrogen oxide, [[ethylene]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]].

However, it [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimes]] easily with gentle heat, resulting in a widespread misconception even taught in some science textbooks that it does not melt. The element was discovered by the French chemist [[Bernard Courtois]] in 1811. It was named two years later by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]], after the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u1f30\u03ce\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2'' \"violet-coloured\".\n\nIodine occurs in many oxidation states, including [[iodide]] (I<sup>\u2212</sup>), [[iodate]] ({{chem|IO|3|-}}), and the various [[periodate]] anions.

Iodine has an electron configuration of [Kr]4d<sup>10</sup>5s<sup>2</sup>5p<sup>5</sup>, with the seven electrons in the fifth and outermost shell being its [[valence electron]]s. Like the other halogens, it is one electron short of a full octet and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell, although in keeping with [[periodic trend]]s, it is the weakest oxidising agent among the stable halogens: it has the lowest [[electronegativity]] among them, just 2.66 on the Pauling scale (compare fluorine, chlorine, and bromine at 3.98, 3.16, and 2.96 respectively; astatine continues the trend with an electronegativity of 2.2). Elemental iodine hence forms [[diatomic molecule]]s with chemical formula I<sub>2</sub>, where two iodine atoms share a pair of electrons in order to each achieve a stable octet for themselves; at high temperatures, these diatomic molecules reversibly dissociate a pair of iodine atoms.

For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitric oxide]], and [[sulfur dioxide]] (to [[phosgene]], [[nitrosyl chloride]], and [[sulfuryl chloride]] respectively), iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, [[rhenium]] metal reacts with chlorine to form [[rhenium hexachloride]], but with bromine it forms only [[rhenium pentabromide]] and iodine can achieve only [[rhenium tetraiodide]].<ref name=Greenwood800/> By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in [[iodine heptafluoride]].<ref name=Greenwood804/>\n\nI<sub>2</sub> dissociates in light with an absorbance at 578&nbsp;nm wavelength.\n\n===Iodine value===\nThe [[iodine value]] is the mass of iodine in grams that is consumed by 100 grams of a [[chemical substance]]. Iodine numbers are often used to determine the amount of unsaturation in [[fatty acid]]s. This unsaturation is in the form of [[double bond]]s, which react with iodine compounds.

It is a colourless gas that reacts with oxygen to give water and iodine. Although it is useful in [[iodination]] reactions in the laboratory, it does not have large-scale industrial uses, unlike the other hydrogen halides. Commercially, it is usually made by reacting iodine with [[hydrogen sulfide]] or [[hydrazine]]:<ref name=Greenwood809>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 809\u201312</ref>\n:2 I<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> {{overset|H<sub>2</sub>O|\u27f6}} 4 HI + N<sub>2</sub>\nAt room temperature, it is a colourless gas, like all of the hydrogen halides except [[hydrogen fluoride]], since hydrogen cannot form strong [[hydrogen bond]]s to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at \u221251.0&nbsp;\u00b0C and boils at \u221235.1&nbsp;\u00b0C. It is an [[endothermic]] compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a [[catalyst]] is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H\u2013I [[bond dissociation energy]] is likewise the smallest of the hydrogen halides, at 295&nbsp;kJ/mol.<ref name=Greenwood812>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 812\u20139</ref>\n\nAqueous hydrogen iodide is known as [[hydroiodic acid]], which is a strong acid. Hydrogen iodide is exceptionally soluble in water: one litre of water will dissolve 425 litres of hydrogen iodide, and the saturated solution has only four water molecules per molecule of hydrogen iodide.<ref>Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. \"Inorganic Chemistry\" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.</ref> Commercial so-called \"concentrated\" hydroiodic acid usually contains 48\u201357% HI by mass; the solution forms an [[azeotrope]] with boiling point 126.7&nbsp;\u00b0C at 56.7&nbsp;g HI per 100&nbsp;g solution. Hence hydroiodic acid cannot be concentrated past this point by evaporation of water.<ref name=Greenwood812/>\n\nUnlike [[hydrogen fluoride]], anhydrous liquid hydrogen iodide is difficult to work with as a solvent, because its boiling point is low, it has a small liquid range, its [[dielectric constant]] is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into H<sub>2</sub>I<sup>+</sup> and {{chem|HI|2|-}} ions \u2013 the latter, in any case, are much less stable than the [[bifluoride]] ions ({{chem|HF|2|-}}) due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and iodine, though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as [[caesium|Cs<sup>+</sup>]] and [[quaternary ammonium cation|{{chem|NR|4|+}}]] (R = [[methyl group|Me]], [[ethyl group|Et]], [[butyl group|Bu<sup>''n''</sup>]]) may still be isolated. Anhydrous hydrogen iodide is a poor solvent, able to dissolve only small molecular compounds such as [[nitrosyl chloride]] and [[phenol]], or salts with very low [[Lattice energy|lattice energies]] such as tetraalkylammonium halides.<ref name=Greenwood812/>\n\n===Other binary iodides===\nNearly all elements in the periodic table form binary iodides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the [[noble gas]]es); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond [[bismuth]]); and having an electronegativity higher than iodine's ([[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], and the first three halogens), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not iodides but rather oxides, nitrides, or halides of iodine. (Nonetheless, [[nitrogen triiodide]] is named as an iodide as it is analogous to the other nitrogen trihalides.)<ref name=Greenwood821/>\n\nGiven the large size of the iodide anion and iodine's weak oxidising power, high oxidation states are difficult to achieve in binary iodides, the maximum known being in the pentaiodides of [[niobium]], [[tantalum]], and [[protactinium]]. Iodides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydroiodic acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen iodide gas. These methods work best when the iodide product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative iodination of the element with iodine or hydrogen iodide, high-temperature iodination of a metal oxide or other halide by iodine, a volatile metal halide, [[carbon tetraiodide]], or an organic iodide. For example, [[molybdenum(IV) oxide]] reacts with [[aluminium(III) iodide]] at 230&nbsp;\u00b0C to give [[molybdenum(II) iodide]]. An example involving halogen exchange is given below, involving the reaction of [[tantalum(V) chloride]] with excess aluminium(III) iodide at 400&nbsp;\u00b0C to give [[tantalum(V) iodide]]:<ref name=Greenwood821>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 821\u20134</ref>\n\n: <chem>3TaCl5 + \\underset{(excess)}{5AlI3} -> 3TaI5 + 5AlCl3</chem>\n\nLower iodides may be produced either through thermal decomposition or disproportionation, or by reducing the higher iodide with hydrogen or a metal, for example:<ref name=Greenwood821/>\n\n: <chem>TaI5{} + Ta ->[\\text{thermal gradient}] [\\ce{630^\\circ C\\ ->\\ 575^\\circ C}] Ta6I14</chem>\n\nMost of the iodides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, along with the [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular iodides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Ionic iodides MI<sub>''n''</sub> tend to have the lowest melting and boiling points among the halides MX<sub>''n''</sub> of the same element, because the electrostatic forces of attraction between the cations and anions are weakest for the large iodide anion. In contrast, covalent iodides tend to instead have the highest melting and boiling points among the halides of the same element, since iodine is the most polarisable of the halogens and, having the most electrons among them, can contribute the most to van der Waals forces. Naturally, exceptions abound in intermediate iodides where one trend gives way to the other. Similarly, solubilities in water of predominantly ionic iodides (e.g. [[potassium]] and [[calcium]]) are the greatest among ionic halides of that element, while those of covalent iodides (e.g. [[silver]]) are the lowest of that element. In particular, [[silver iodide]] is very insoluble in water and its formation is often used as a qualitative test for iodine.<ref name=Greenwood821/>\n\n===Iodine halides===\nThe halogens form many binary, [[diamagnetic]] [[interhalogen]] compounds with stoichiometries XY, XY<sub>3</sub>, XY<sub>5</sub>, and XY<sub>7</sub> (where X is heavier than Y), and iodine is no exception. Iodine forms all three possible diatomic interhalogens, a trifluoride and trichloride, as well as a pentafluoride and, exceptionally among the halogens, a heptafluoride. Numerous cationic and anionic derivatives are also characterised, such as the wine-red or bright orange compounds of {{chem|ICl|2|+}} and the dark brown or purplish black compounds of I<sub>2</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup>. Apart from these, some [[pseudohalogen|pseudohalides]] are also known, such as [[cyanogen iodide]] (ICN), iodine [[thiocyanate]] (ISCN), and iodine [[azide]] (IN<sub>3</sub>).<ref name=Greenwood824>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 824\u20138</ref>\n\n[[File:Iodine monochloride1.jpg|thumb|right|Iodine monochloride]]\n[[Iodine monofluoride]] (IF) is unstable at room temperature and disproportionates very readily and irreversibly to iodine and [[iodine pentafluoride]], and thus cannot be obtained pure. It can be synthesised from the reaction of iodine with fluorine gas in [[trichlorofluoromethane]] at \u221245&nbsp;\u00b0C, with [[iodine trifluoride]] in trichlorofluoromethane at \u221278&nbsp;\u00b0C, or with [[silver(I) fluoride]] at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=Greenwood824/> [[Iodine monochloride]] (ICl) and [[iodine monobromide]] (IBr), on the other hand, are moderately stable. The former, a volatile red-brown compound, was discovered independently by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Humphry Davy]] in 1813\u20134 not long after the discoveries of chlorine and iodine, and it mimics the intermediate halogen bromine so well that [[Justus von Liebig]] was misled into mistaking bromine (which he had found) for iodine monochloride. Iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide may be prepared simply by reacting iodine with chlorine or bromine at room temperature and purified by [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallisation]]. Both are quite reactive and attack even [[platinum]] and [[gold]], though not [[boron]], [[carbon]], [[cadmium]], [[lead]], [[zirconium]], [[niobium]], [[molybdenum]], and [[tungsten]]. Their reaction with organic compounds depends on conditions. Iodine chloride vapour tends to chlorinate [[phenol]] and [[salicyclic acid]], since when iodine chloride undergoes homolytic dissociation, chlorine and iodine are produced and the former is more reactive. However, iodine chloride in tetrachloromethane solution results in iodination being the main reaction, since now heterolytic fission of the I\u2013Cl bond occurs and I<sup>+</sup> attacks phenol as an electrophile. However, iodine monobromide tends to brominate phenol even in tetrachloromethane solution because it tends to dissociate into its elements in solution, and bromine is more reactive than iodine.<ref name=Greenwood824/> When liquid, iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide dissociate into {{chem|I|2|X|+}} and {{chem|IX|2|-}} anions (X = Cl, Br); thus they are significant conductors of electricity and can be used as ionising solvents.<ref name=Greenwood824/>\n\n[[Iodine trifluoride]] (IF<sub>3</sub>) is an unstable yellow solid that decomposes above \u221228&nbsp;\u00b0C. It is thus little-known. It is difficult to produce because fluorine gas would tend to oxidise iodine all the way to the pentafluoride; reaction at low temperature with [[xenon difluoride]] is necessary. [[Iodine trichloride]], which exists in the solid state as the planar dimer I<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, is a bright yellow solid, synthesised by reacting iodine with liquid chlorine at \u221280&nbsp;\u00b0C; caution is necessary during purification because it easily dissociates to iodine monochloride and chlorine and hence can act as a strong chlorinating agent. Liquid iodine trichloride conducts electricity, possibly indicating dissociation to {{chem|ICl|2|+}} and {{chem|ICl|4|-}} ions.<ref name=Greenwood828>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 828\u201331</ref>\n\n[[Iodine pentafluoride]] (IF<sub>5</sub>), a colourless, volatile liquid, is the most thermodynamically stable iodine fluoride, and can be made by reacting iodine with fluorine gas at room temperature. It is a fluorinating agent, but is mild enough to store in glass apparatus. Again, slight electrical conductivity is present in the liquid state because of dissociation to {{chem|IF|4|+}} and {{chem|IF|6|-}}. The [[pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry|pentagonal bipyramidal]] [[iodine heptafluoride]] (IF<sub>7</sub>) is an extremely powerful fluorinating agent, behind only [[chlorine trifluoride]], [[chlorine pentafluoride]], and [[bromine pentafluoride]] among the interhalogens: it reacts with almost all the elements even at low temperatures, fluorinates [[Pyrex]] glass to form iodine(VII) oxyfluoride (IOF<sub>5</sub>), and sets carbon monoxide on fire.<ref name=Greenwood832>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 832\u20135</ref>\n\n===Iodine oxides and oxoacids===\n[[File:Iodine-pentoxide-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Structure of iodine pentoxide]]\n[[Iodine oxide]]s are the most stable of all the halogen oxides, because of the strong I\u2013O bonds resulting from the large electronegativity difference between iodine and oxygen, and they have been known for the longest time.<ref name=King/> The stable, white, [[hygroscopic]] [[iodine pentoxide]] (I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) has been known since its formation in 1813 by Gay-Lussac and Davy. It is most easily made by the dehydration of [[iodic acid]] (HIO<sub>3</sub>), of which it is the anhydride. It will quickly oxidise carbon monoxide completely to [[carbon dioxide]] at room temperature, and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration. It also oxidises nitrogen oxide, [[ethylene]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]]. It reacts with [[sulfur trioxide]] and [[peroxydisulfuryl difluoride]] (S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) to form salts of the iodyl cation, [IO<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, and is reduced by concentrated [[sulfuric acid]]s to iodosyl salts involving [IO]<sup>+</sup>. It may be fluorinated by fluorine, bromine trifluoride, [[sulfur tetrafluoride]], or [[chloryl fluoride]], resulting iodine pentafluoride, which also reacts with iodine pentoxide, giving iodine(V) oxyfluoride, IOF<sub>3</sub>. A few other less stable oxides are known, notably I<sub>4</sub>O<sub>9</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; their structures have not been determined, but reasonable guesses are I<sup>III</sup>(I<sup>V</sup>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and [IO]<sup>+</sup>[IO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> respectively.<ref name=Greenwood851>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 851\u20133</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-top:0; margin-left:1em; text-align:center; font-size:10pt; line-height:11pt; width:25%;\"\n|+ Standard reduction potentials for aqueous I species<ref name=Greenwood853/>\n! {{nowrap|E\u00b0(couple)}}!!{{nowrap|''a''(H<sup>+</sup>) {{=}} 1}}<br>(acid)!!{{nowrap|E\u00b0(couple)}}!!{{nowrap|''a''(OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) {{=}} 1}}<br>(base)\n|-\n|I<sub>2</sub>/I<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.535|||I<sub>2</sub>/I<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.535\n|-\n|HOI/I<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.987||IO<sup>\u2212</sup>/I<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.48\n|-\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{chem|IO|3|-}}/I<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.26\n|-\n|HOI/I<sub>2</sub>||+1.439||IO<sup>\u2212</sup>/I<sub>2</sub>||+0.42\n|-\n|{{chem|IO|3|-}}/I<sub>2</sub>||+1.195||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n|{{chem|IO|3|-}}/HOI||+1.134||{{chem|IO|3|-}}/IO<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.15\n|-\n|{{chem|IO|4|-}}/{{chem|IO|3|-}}||+1.653||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n|H<sub>5</sub>IO<sub>6</sub>/{{chem|IO|3|-}}||+1.601||{{chem|H|3|IO|6|2-}}/{{chem|IO|3|-}}||+0.65\n|}\nMore important are the four oxoacids: [[hypoiodous acid]] (HIO), [[iodous acid]] (HIO<sub>2</sub>), [[iodic acid]] (HIO<sub>3</sub>), and [[periodic acid]] (HIO<sub>4</sub> or H<sub>5</sub>IO<sub>6</sub>).

Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by [[electrolysis]] or fuming [[nitric acid]]. Iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.<ref name=Greenwood863>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 863\u20134</ref>\n\nMany periodates are known, including not only the expected tetrahedral {{chem|IO|4|-}}, but also square-pyramidal {{chem|IO|5|3-}}, octahedral orthoperiodate {{chem|IO|6|5-}}, [IO<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2\u2212</sup>, [I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>(OH<sub>2</sub>)]<sup>4\u2212</sup>, and {{chem|I|2|O|9|4-}}.

[[Orthoperiodic acid]], H<sub>5</sub>IO<sub>6</sub>, is stable, and dehydrates at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C in a vacuum to [[metaperiodic acid]], HIO<sub>4</sub>. Attempting to go further does not result in the nonexistent iodine heptoxide (I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), but rather iodine pentoxide and oxygen. Periodic acid may be protonated by [[sulfuric acid]] to give the {{chem|I(OH)|6|+}} cation, isoelectronic to Te(OH)<sub>6</sub> and {{chem|Sb(OH)|6|-}}, and giving salts with bisulfate and sulfate.<ref name=King/>\n\n===Polyiodine compounds===\nWhen iodine dissolves in strong acids, such as fuming sulfuric acid, a bright blue [[paramagnetic]] solution including {{chem|I|2|+}} cations is formed.

In humans, the ratio of T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub> released into the blood is between 14:1 and 20:1. T<sub>4</sub> is converted to the active T<sub>3</sub> (three to four times more potent than T<sub>4</sub>) within [[cell (biology)|cells]] by [[deiodinase]]s (5'-iodinase). These are further processed by [[decarboxylation]] and deiodination to produce [[iodothyronamine]] (T<sub>1</sub>a) and [[thyronamine]] (T<sub>0</sub>a'). All three isoforms of the deiodinases are [[selenium]]-containing enzymes; thus dietary selenium is essential for T<sub>3</sub> production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/819692-overview#showall|last1=Irizarry|first1=Lisandro|title=Thyroid Hormone Toxicity|website=Medscape|publisher=WedMD LLC|date=23 April 2014|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIodine accounts for 65% of the molecular weight of T<sub>4</sub> and 59% of T<sub>3</sub>. Fifteen to 20&nbsp;mg of iodine is concentrated in thyroid tissue and hormones, but 70% of all iodine in the body is found in other tissues, including mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, fetal thymus, cerebro-spinal fluid and choroid plexus, arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of those tissues, iodide enters directly by [[sodium-iodide symporter]] (NIS). The action of iodine in mammary tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development, but in the other tissues, it is (at least) partially unknown.<ref name=\"Patrick2008\" />\n\n===Dietary intake===\nRecommendations by the United States [[Institute of Medicine]] are between 110 and 130 [[microgram|\u00b5g]] for infants up to 12 months, 90&nbsp;\u00b5g for children up to eight years, 130&nbsp;\u00b5g for children up to 13 years, 150&nbsp;\u00b5g for adults, 220&nbsp;\u00b5g for pregnant women and 290&nbsp;\u00b5g for lactation.<ref name=lpi/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://iom.edu/en/Global/News%20Announcements/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRIs/DRISummaryListing2.ashx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030004039/http://iom.edu/en/Global/News%20Announcements/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRIs/DRISummaryListing2.ashx |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 October 2009 |title=Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs): Recommended Intakes for Individuals, Vitamins |publisher=[[Institute of Medicine]] |date=2004 |accessdate=9 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults is 1,100&nbsp;\u03bcg/day.<ref name=\"InstituteofMedicine\">{{Cite book| author = United States National Research Council| date = 2000|title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Zinc|pages = 258\u2013259| publisher = National Academies Press| url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10026&page=258| doi = 10.17226/10026| pmid = 25057538| isbn = 978-0-309-07279-3}}</ref> This upper limit was assessed by analyzing the effect of supplementation on [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]].<ref name=\"Patrick2008\"/>\n\nThe thyroid gland needs no more than 70&nbsp;\u03bcg/day to synthesise the requisite daily amounts of T4 and T3.<ref name=lpi/> The higher recommended daily allowance levels of iodine seem necessary for optimal function of a number of body systems, including [[lactation]], [[gastric mucosa]], [[salivary gland]]s, brain cells, [[choroid plexus]], [[thymus]], and [[artery|arterial walls]].<ref name=lpi/><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, S, Venturi.
