The school was founded in 1924 by Sir [[Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]], Dr. [[James Emman Kwegyir Aggrey]] and the [[Rev. Alexander (Alec) Garden Fraser|Rev. Alec Garden Fraser]]. It was formally opened in 1927 by Sir Frederick Guggisberg, then Governor of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] colony. Achimota, modelled on the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|British public school]] system, was the first [[Mixed-gender education|mixed-gender school]] to be established on the Gold Coast.\n\nThe school has educated many African leaders, including [[Kwame Nkrumah]], [[Edward Akufo-Addo]], [[Jerry Rawlings|Jerry John Rawlings]], and [[John Evans Atta Mills]] all of whom are former [[Heads of State of Ghana]]. Former [[President of Ghana]], [[John Dramani Mahama]] had his primary education there while former [[Prime Minister of Ghana]], [[Kofi Abrefa Busia]] also taught at Achimota.

An alumnus/alumna of Achimota is known as an \"Akora\".\n\nThe motto of the school is ''[[Ut Omnes Unum Sint]]'' meaning \"That they all may be one\", a reference to the founders' expressed philosophy that starting in the context of school life, black and white, male and female, everyone should integrate and combine synergistically for the good of all. The stylised piano-key design of the Achimota School crest was described by Aggrey at the time: \"You can play a tune of sorts on the black keys only; and you can play a tune of sorts on the white keys only; but for perfect harmony, you must use both the black and the white keys.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724221438/http://www.ac2010.org/about_achimota.html Achimota School Capital Campaign], 24 July 2011, Ac2010.org.

The three Statues are arranged in a Triangle-like formation with an unknown significance.\n\n==History==\nAfter the First World War, the Government of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] felt the need for an advanced education. As Guggisberg put it, \"In spite of the existence of one or two educational institutions of a secondary nature, the intellectual gap between the African who had completed his education at an English University and the semi-educated African of our primary school is dangerously wide. No one is more ready than I to sympathize with the legitimate aspirations of the African for advancement and for a greater share in the Government of this country, but if we are to help him to do this, if we are to protect the masses from the hasty and ill-conceived schemes of possible local [[demagogue]]s, we must hasten as rapidly as our means will allow to fill up the gap between the two classes.\"<ref name=\"gquote\">[[Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]], quoted in Stephanie Newell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 Literary Culture in Colonial Ghana: How to Play the Game of Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927111336/http://books.google.ca/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 |date=27 September 2013 }}'', 2002, [[Manchester University Press]], 256 pages, p. 93. {{ISBN|978-0719062742}}</ref>\n\nAchimota College was therefore established as part of Guggisberg's plan to reform the Gold Coast educational system. In August 1920, Guggisberg met and befriended native-born Dr. [[James Aggrey]] who was in the Gold Coast as a member of the [[Phelps Stokes Fund]]'s African Education Commission. In 1922, as a result of the Phelps-Stokes Commission's 1920 report on education, Guggisberg appointed a committee to review its recommendations for Gold Coast education reform. That committee recommended the establishment of a comprehensive institution at Achimota to provide general secondary education, teacher training and technical education for male students. Achimota College was then conceived, thanks to the effort and support of Chiefs such as Nene Sir [[Emmanuel Mate Kole]], Konor of Manya Krobo; [[Nana Sir Ofori Atta]], Omanhene of [[Akyem Abuakwa]] and Nana Amonoo V, Omanhene of [[Anomabo]], as well as prominent statesmen of the time such as the Hon. Dr. [[Benjamin W. Quartey Quaye Papafio]], the Hon. [[F. V. Nanka-Bruce]], both of Accra; the Hon. [[Thomas Hutton-Mills, Sr.]] of Accra, the Hon. E. J. P. Brown of [[Cape Coast]], and the Hon. [[J. E. Casely-Hayford]] of [[Sekondi]].\n\nThe Colonial government meant to carry out its policy to establish an excellent secondary institution where teachers as well as students would be trained. The Legislative Council went on to approve the 1923\u201324 budget for the establishment of the Prince of Wales College and School, and in March 1924, Guggisberg laid the foundation stone. Rev. Alexander G. Fraser was the first Principal (1924\u20131935), and Dr. [[James Aggrey]] was the first Vice-Principal (1924\u20131927). Fraser had previously been Principal of [[Trinity College, Kandy]], an elite school in [[Ceylon]], now [[Sri Lanka]], and was hailed as the greatest colonial headmaster of his day by the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Aggrey campaigned vigorously for women's education at a time when the idea was not popular, and held the belief that to educate a man was to educate an individual, while educating a woman had more far-reaching benefits to family and community. This led to an increase in the number of places offered to girls by the College.\n\nFrom 1924 until it opened on 28 January 1927, Guggisberg, Fraser and Aggrey worked together to realise Guggisberg's dream of establishing a first-class co-educational school and college.

It was formally opened in 1927 by Sir Frederick Guggisberg, then Governor of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] colony.

The stylised piano-key design of the Achimota School crest was described by Aggrey at the time: \"You can play a tune of sorts on the black keys only; and you can play a tune of sorts on the white keys only; but for perfect harmony, you must use both the black and the white keys.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724221438/http://www.ac2010.org/about_achimota.html Achimota School Capital Campaign], 24 July 2011, Ac2010.org.

As Guggisberg put it, \"In spite of the existence of one or two educational institutions of a secondary nature, the intellectual gap between the African who had completed his education at an English University and the semi-educated African of our primary school is dangerously wide. No one is more ready than I to sympathize with the legitimate aspirations of the African for advancement and for a greater share in the Government of this country, but if we are to help him to do this, if we are to protect the masses from the hasty and ill-conceived schemes of possible local [[demagogue]]s, we must hasten as rapidly as our means will allow to fill up the gap between the two classes.\"<ref name=\"gquote\">[[Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]], quoted in Stephanie Newell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 Literary Culture in Colonial Ghana: How to Play the Game of Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927111336/http://books.google.ca/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 |date=27 September 2013 }}'', 2002, [[Manchester University Press]], 256 pages, p. 93. {{ISBN|978-0719062742}}</ref>\n\nAchimota College was therefore established as part of Guggisberg's plan to reform the Gold Coast educational system. In August 1920, Guggisberg met and befriended native-born Dr. [[James Aggrey]] who was in the Gold Coast as a member of the [[Phelps Stokes Fund]]'s African Education Commission. In 1922, as a result of the Phelps-Stokes Commission's 1920 report on education, Guggisberg appointed a committee to review its recommendations for Gold Coast education reform. That committee recommended the establishment of a comprehensive institution at Achimota to provide general secondary education, teacher training and technical education for male students. Achimota College was then conceived, thanks to the effort and support of Chiefs such as Nene Sir [[Emmanuel Mate Kole]], Konor of Manya Krobo; [[Nana Sir Ofori Atta]], Omanhene of [[Akyem Abuakwa]] and Nana Amonoo V, Omanhene of [[Anomabo]], as well as prominent statesmen of the time such as the Hon. Dr. [[Benjamin W. Quartey Quaye Papafio]], the Hon. [[F. V. Nanka-Bruce]], both of Accra; the Hon. [[Thomas Hutton-Mills, Sr.]] of Accra, the Hon. E. J. P. Brown of [[Cape Coast]], and the Hon. [[J. E. Casely-Hayford]] of [[Sekondi]].\n\nThe Colonial government meant to carry out its policy to establish an excellent secondary institution where teachers as well as students would be trained. The Legislative Council went on to approve the 1923\u201324 budget for the establishment of the Prince of Wales College and School, and in March 1924, Guggisberg laid the foundation stone. Rev. Alexander G. Fraser was the first Principal (1924\u20131935), and Dr. [[James Aggrey]] was the first Vice-Principal (1924\u20131927). Fraser had previously been Principal of [[Trinity College, Kandy]], an elite school in [[Ceylon]], now [[Sri Lanka]], and was hailed as the greatest colonial headmaster of his day by the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Aggrey campaigned vigorously for women's education at a time when the idea was not popular, and held the belief that to educate a man was to educate an individual, while educating a woman had more far-reaching benefits to family and community. This led to an increase in the number of places offered to girls by the College.\n\nFrom 1924 until it opened on 28 January 1927, Guggisberg, Fraser and Aggrey worked together to realise Guggisberg's dream of establishing a first-class co-educational school and college.

{"title_page": "Long run and short run", "text_new": "In economics the '''long run''' is a theoretical concept in which all markets are in [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], and all prices and quantities have fully adjusted and are in equilibrium. The long run contrasts with the '''short run''', in which there are some constraints and markets are not fully in equilibrium. \n\nMore specifically, in [[microeconomics]] there are no [[fixed factors of production]] in the long run, and there is enough time for adjustment so that there are no constraints preventing changing the output level by changing the [[Capital (economics)|capital stock]] or by entering or leaving an industry. This contrasts with the short run, where some factors are variable (dependent on the quantity produced) and others are fixed (paid once), constraining entry or exit from an industry.  In [[macroeconomics]], the long run is the period when the general [[price level]],  contractual wage rates, and expectations adjust fully to the state of the economy, in contrast to the short run when these variables may not fully adjust.<ref>Paul A.

However, there is no hard and fast definition as to what is classified as \"long\" or \"short\" and mostly relies on the economic perspective being taken. Marshall's original introduction of long-run and short-run economics reflected the \u2018long-period method\u2019 that was a common analysis used by classical political economists. However, early in the 1930s, dissatisfaction with a variety of the conclusions of Marshall's original theory led to methods of analysis and introduction of equilibrium notions. [[Classical economics|Classical political economists]], [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] economists, [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] economists all have slightly different interpretations and explanations as to how short-run and long-run equilibriums are defined, reached, and what factors influence them.<ref>Panico C., Petri F. (2008) Long Run and Short Run. Some of Marshall's original theories, adapted into new terminology and a variety of other analyses are some of the ways the Long Run and Short Run theories have been shaped. In: Palgrave Macmillan (eds) The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Palgrave Macmillan, London</ref>\n\n==Long run==\nSince its origin, the \"long period method\" has been used to determine how production, distribution and accumulation take place within the economy.  In a  long run, [[business|firm]]s change production levels in response to (expected) [[economic profit]]s or losses, and the  [[land (economics)|land]], [[labour (economics)|labour]], [[capital goods]] and [[entrepreneurship]] vary to reach the minimum level of long-run [[average cost]]. In the simplified case of plant capacity as the only fixed factor, a generic firm can make these changes in the long run:\n* enter an industry in response to (expected) profits\n* leave an industry in response to losses\n* increase its plant in response to profits\n* decrease its plant in response to losses \n\nThe long run is associated with the [[Cost curve#Long-run average cost curve (LRAC)|long-run average cost]] (LRAC) curve in [[microeconomic]] models along which a firm would minimize its [[average cost]] (cost per unit) for each respective long-run quantity of output.  ''[[Long-run marginal cost]]'' (''LRMC'') is the added cost of providing an additional unit of [[Service (economics)|service]] or [[commodity]] from changing capacity level to reach the lowest cost associated with that extra output. LRMC equalling price is efficient as to [[resource allocation]] in the long run. The concept of ''long-run cost'' is also used in determining whether the firm will remain in the industry or shut down production there. In long-run equilibrium of an industry in which [[perfect competition]] prevails, the LRMC = LRAC at the minimum LRAC and associated output. The shape of the long-run marginal and average costs curves is influenced by the type of [[returns to scale]]. \n\nThe long run is a planning and implementation stage.<ref> Melvin & Boyes,  2002. ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed., p. 185. Houghton Mifflin.</ref><ref name=\"Boyes, W page 107\">Boyes, W., 2004. ''The New Managerial Economics'', p. 107. Houghton Mifflin.</ref> Here a firm may decide that it needs to produce on a larger scale by building a new plant or adding a production line. The firm may decide that new technology should be incorporated into its production process. The firm thus considers all its long-run production options and selects the optimal combination of inputs and technology for its long-run purposes.<ref>Melvin & Boyes, 2002. ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed., p. 185. Houghton Mifflin.</ref> The optimal combination of inputs is the least-cost combination of inputs for desired level of output when all inputs are variable.<ref name=\"Boyes, W page 107\"/> Once the decisions are made and implemented and production begins, the firm is operating in the short run with fixed and variable inputs.<ref name=\"Boyes, W page 107\"/><ref> Perloff, J, 2008. ''Microeconomics Theory & Applications with Calculus'', p. 230. Pearson .</ref> . Another part of the development of planning what a firm may decide if it needs to produce more on a larger scale or not is Keynes theory that the level of employment(labor), oscillates over an average or intermediate period, the equilibrium.  This level of fixed capital is determined by the effective demand of a good.  Changes in the economy, based on capital, variable and fixed cost can be studied by comparing the long run equilibrium to before and after changes in the economy.  \n\n==Short run==\nAll production in real time occurs in the short run.  \nIn the short run, a [[profit maximization|profit-maximizing]] firm will:\n* increase production if [[marginal cost]] is less than [[marginal revenue]] (added revenue per additional unit of output);\n* decrease production if [[marginal cost]] is greater than [[marginal revenue]];\n* continue producing if [[average variable cost]] is less than [[price]] per unit, even if [[average total cost]] is greater than [[price]];\n* shut down if [[average variable cost]] is greater than [[price]] at each level of outputs\n\n==Transition from short run to long run==\nThe transition from the short run to the long run may be done by considering some short-run equilibrium that is also a long-run equilibrium as to [[supply and demand]], then comparing that state against a new short-run and long-run equilibrium state from a change that disturbs  equilibrium, say in the sales-tax rate,  tracing out the short-run adjustment first, then the long-run adjustment.  Each is an example of [[comparative statics]]. [[Alfred Marshall]] (1890) pioneered in comparative-static period analysis.<ref>\u2022 John K. Whitaker, 2008. \"Marshall, Alfred (1842\u20131924),\" Price determination and period analysis, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2022 Alfred Marshall, [1890] 1890.

''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', pp. 4\u20135.</ref> In later macroeconomic usage, the long run is the period in which the [[price level]] for the overall economy is completely flexible as to shifts in [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]]. In addition there is full mobility of labor and capital between [[List of recognized economic sectors|sectors]] of the economy and full [[Capital (economics)|capital]] mobility between nations. In the short run none of these conditions need fully hold.

The long run contrasts with the '''short run''', in which there are some constraints and markets are not fully in equilibrium. \n\nMore specifically, in [[microeconomics]] there are no [[fixed factors of production]] in the long run, and there is enough time for adjustment so that there are no constraints preventing changing the output level by changing the [[Capital (economics)|capital stock]] or by entering or leaving an industry. This contrasts with the short run, where some factors are variable (dependent on the quantity produced) and others are fixed (paid once), constraining entry or exit from an industry.  In [[macroeconomics]], the long run is the period when the general [[price level]],  contractual wage rates, and expectations adjust fully to the state of the economy, in contrast to the short run when these variables may not fully adjust.<ref>Paul A.

However, there is no hard and fast definition as to what is classified as \"long\" or \"short\" and mostly relies on the economic perspective being taken. Marshall's original introduction of long-run and short-run economics reflected the \u2018long-period method\u2019 that was a common analysis used by classical political economists. However, early in the 1930s, dissatisfaction with a variety of the conclusions of Marshall's original theory led to methods of analysis and introduction of equilibrium notions. [[Classical economics|Classical political economists]], [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] economists, [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] economists all have slightly different interpretations and explanations as to how short-run and long-run equilibriums are defined, reached, and what factors influence them<ref>Panico C., Petri F. (2008) Long Run and Short Run. Some of Marshall's original theories, adapted into new terminology and a variety of other analyses are some of the ways the Long Run and Short Run theories have been shaped. In: Palgrave Macmillan (eds) The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Palgrave Macmillan, London</ref>.\n\n==Long run==\nSince its origin, the \"long period method\" has been used to determine how production, distribution and accumulation take place within the economy.  In a  long run, [[business|firm]]s change production levels in response to (expected) [[economic profit]]s or losses, and the  [[land (economics)|land]], [[labour (economics)|labour]], [[capital goods]] and [[entrepreneurship]] vary to reach the minimum level of long-run [[average cost]]. In the simplified case of plant capacity as the only fixed factor, a generic firm can make these changes in the long run:\n* enter an industry in response to (expected) profits\n* leave an industry in response to losses\n* increase its plant in response to profits\n* decrease its plant in response to losses \n\nThe long run is associated with the [[Cost curve#Long-run average cost curve (LRAC)|long-run average cost]] (LRAC) curve in [[microeconomic]] models along which a firm would minimize its [[average cost]] (cost per unit) for each respective long-run quantity of output.  ''[[Long-run marginal cost]]'' (''LRMC'') is the added cost of providing an additional unit of [[Service (economics)|service]] or [[commodity]] from changing capacity level to reach the lowest cost associated with that extra output. LRMC equalling price is efficient as to [[resource allocation]] in the long run. The concept of ''long-run cost'' is also used in determining whether the firm will remain in the industry or shut down production there. In long-run equilibrium of an industry in which [[perfect competition]] prevails, the LRMC = LRAC at the minimum LRAC and associated output. The shape of the long-run marginal and average costs curves is influenced by the type of [[returns to scale]]. \n\nThe long run is a planning and implementation stage.<ref> Melvin & Boyes,  2002. ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed., p. 185. Houghton Mifflin.</ref><ref name=\"Boyes, W page 107\">Boyes, W., 2004. ''The New Managerial Economics'', p. 107. Houghton Mifflin.</ref> Here a firm may decide that it needs to produce on a larger scale by building a new plant or adding a production line. The firm may decide that new technology should be incorporated into its production process. The firm thus considers all its long-run production options and selects the optimal combination of inputs and technology for its long-run purposes.<ref>Melvin & Boyes, 2002. ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed., p. 185. Houghton Mifflin.</ref> The optimal combination of inputs is the least-cost combination of inputs for desired level of output when all inputs are variable.<ref name=\"Boyes, W page 107\"/> Once the decisions are made and implemented and production begins, the firm is operating in the short run with fixed and variable inputs.<ref name=\"Boyes, W page 107\"/><ref> Perloff, J, 2008. ''Microeconomics Theory & Applications with Calculus'', p. 230. Pearson .</ref> . Another part of the development of planning what a firm may decide if it needs to produce more on a larger scale or not is Keynes theory that the level of employment(labor), oscillates over an average or intermediate period, the equilibrium.  This level of fixed capital is determined by the effective demand of a good.  Changes in the economy, based on capital, variable and fixed cost can be studied by comparing the long run equilibrium to before and after changes in the economy.  \n\n==Short run==\nAll production in real time occurs in the short run.  \nIn the short run, a [[profit maximization|profit-maximizing]] firm will:\n* increase production if [[marginal cost]] is less than [[marginal revenue]] (added revenue per additional unit of output);\n* decrease production if [[marginal cost]] is greater than [[marginal revenue]];\n* continue producing if [[average variable cost]] is less than [[price]] per unit, even if [[average total cost]] is greater than [[price]];\n* shut down if [[average variable cost]] is greater than [[price]] at each level of outputs\n\n==Transition from short run to long run==\nThe transition from the short run to the long run may be done by considering some short-run equilibrium that is also a long-run equilibrium as to [[supply and demand]], then comparing that state against a new short-run and long-run equilibrium state from a change that disturbs  equilibrium, say in the sales-tax rate,  tracing out the short-run adjustment first, then the long-run adjustment.  Each is an example of [[comparative statics]]. [[Alfred Marshall]] (1890) pioneered in comparative-static period analysis.<ref>\u2022 John K. Whitaker, 2008. \"Marshall, Alfred (1842\u20131924),\" Price determination and period analysis, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2022 Alfred Marshall, [1890] 1890.

''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', pp. 4\u20135.</ref> In later macroeconomic usage, the long run is the period in which the [[price level]] for the overall economy is completely flexible as to shifts in [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]]. In addition there is full mobility of labor and capital between [[List of recognized economic sectors|sectors]] of the economy and full [[Capital (economics)|capital]] mobility between nations. In the short run none of these conditions need fully hold.
