Generally one anemone contains a 'harem', consisting of a large female, a smaller reproductive male, and even smaller non-reproductive males. If the female is removed, the reproductive male will change sex and the largest of the non-reproductive males will mature and become reproductive. It has been shown that fishing pressure can change when the switch from male to female occurs, since fishermen usually prefer to catch the larger fish. The populations are generally changing sex at a smaller size, due to [[natural selection]].\n* '''Protogyny''': Where the organism is born as a female, and then changes sex to a male.<ref name=barrows/>\n** Example: [[wrasse]]s (Family [[Labridae]]) are a group of reef fish in which protogyny is common. Wrasses also have an uncommon life history strategy, which is termed diandry (literally, two males). In these species, two male morphs exists: an initial phase male and a terminal phase male. Initial phase males do not look like males and spawn in groups with other females. They are not territorial. They are, perhaps, female mimics (which is why they are found swimming in group with other females). Terminal phase males are territorial and have a distinctively bright coloration. Individuals are born as males or females, but if they are born males, they are not born as terminal phase males. Females and initial phase males can become terminal phase males. Usually, the most dominant female or initial phase male replaces any terminal phase male when those males die or abandon the group.\n*'''Bidirectional Sex Changers''': where an organism has female and male reproductive organs, but act as either female or male during different stages in life.<ref name=barrows/>\n**Example: [[Lythrypnus dalli]] (Family [[Lythrypnus]]) are a group of [[coral reef fish]] in which bidirectional sex change occurs. Once a social hierarchy is established a fish changes sex according to its social status, regardless of the initial sex, based on a simple principle: if the fish expresses subordinate behavior then it changes its sex to female, and if the fish expresses dominant or not subordinate behavior then the fish changes its sex to male.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rodgers|first=E.W.|author2=Early, R.L. |author3=Grober, M.S. |title=Social status determines sexual phenotype in the bi-directional sex changing bluebanded goby Lythrypnus dalli|journal=J Fish Biol|year=2007|volume=70|issue=6|pages=1660\u20131668|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01427.x}}</ref>\nDichogamy can have both conservation-related implications for humans, as mentioned above, as well as economic implications. For instance, [[grouper]]s are favoured fish for eating in many Asian countries and are often [[aquacultured]]. Since the adults take several years to change from female to male, the [[broodstock]] are extremely valuable individuals.\n\n===Simultaneous hermaphrodites===<!-- This section is linked from [[Gnathostomulid]] -->\n<!--\"Simultaneous hermaphrodite\" redirects here -->\n[[File:Mating Pseudobiceros bedfordi.png|thumb|[[Turbellaria]]ns mating by [[penis fencing]].

Sexual material is exchanged between both animals via [[spermatophore]], which can then be stored in the [[spermatheca]]. After exchange of [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]], both animals will lay fertilized eggs after a period of gestation; then the eggs will proceed to hatch after a development period. Snails typically reproduce in early spring and late autumn.\n*[[:Banana slug]]s are one example of a hermaphroditic gastropod. Mating with a partner is more desirable biologically, as the genetic material of the resultant offspring is varied, but if mating with a partner is not possible, self-fertilization is practiced. The male sexual organ of an adult banana slug is quite large in proportion to its size, as well as compared to the female organ. It is possible for banana slugs, while mating, to become stuck together. If a substantial amount of wiggling fails to separate them, the male organ will be bitten off (using the slug's [[radula]]), see [[apophallation]]. If a banana slug has lost its male sexual organ, it can still mate as a female, making its hermaphroditic quality a valuable adaptation.\n* The species of colourful [[sea slugs]] ''[[Goniobranchus reticulatus]]'' is hermaphroditic, with both male and female organs active at the same time during copulation.  After mating, the external portion of the penis detaches, but is able to regrow within 24 hours.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21431678 | title = Sea slug's 'disposable penis' surprises | author = Rebecca Morelle | date = 12 February 2013 | work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2012.1150 | title = Disposable penis and its replenishment in a simultaneous hermaphrodite | year = 2013 | last1 = Sekizawa | first1 = A. | last2 = Seki | first2 = S. | last3 = Tokuzato | first3 = M. | last4 = Shiga | first4 = S. | last5 = Nakashima | first5 = Y. | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 20121150 | pmid=23407499 | pmc=3639767}}</ref>\n* [[Hamlet (fish)|Hamlets]], unlike other fish, seem quite at ease mating in front of divers, allowing observations in the wild to occur readily. They do not practice self-fertilization, but when they find a mate, the pair takes turns between which one acts as the male and which acts as the female through multiple matings, usually over the course of several nights.\n* [[Earthworm]]s are another example of a simultaneous hermaphrodite. Although they possess ovaries and testes, they have a protective mechanism against self-fertilization. Sexual reproduction occurs when two worms meet and exchange [[gamete]]s, copulating on damp nights during warm seasons. Fertilized eggs are protected by a cocoon, which is buried on or near the surface of the ground.\n* The free-living hermaphroditic nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' reproduces primarily by self-fertilization, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of approximately 1%.<ref name=\"pmid16005289\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Barri\u00e8re A, F\u00e9lix MA|title=High local genetic diversity and low outcrossing rate in Caenorhabditis elegans natural populations |journal=Curr.

Other kinds of intersex conditions are identified immediately at birth because those with the condition have a sexual organ larger than a clitoris and smaller than a penis.\n\nSome humans were historically termed [[true hermaphroditism|true hermaphrodites]] if their [[gonad]]al tissue contained both testicular and ovarian tissue, or [[pseudohermaphroditism|pseudohermaphrodites]] if their external appearance ([[phenotype]]) differed from sex expected from internal gonads.

One possible pathophysiologic explanation of intersex in humans is a [[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]] division of a haploid ovum into two haploid ova. Upon fertilization of the two ova by two sperm cells (one carrying an [[X chromosome|X]] chromosome and the other carrying a [[Y chromosome|Y]] chromosome), the two [[zygote|fertilized ova]] are then [[Chimera (genetics)|fused together]] resulting in a person having dual genitalial, gonadal ([[ovotestes]]) and [[Sex-determination system|genetic sex]]. Another common cause of being intersex is the crossing over of the [[SRY]] from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome during [[meiosis]]. The SRY is then activated in only certain areas, causing development of [[testes]] in some areas by beginning a series of events starting with the upregulation of [[SOX9]], and in other areas not being active (causing the growth of [[ovarian]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s). Thus, [[testicular]] and ovarian tissues will both be present in the same individual.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Margarit | first1 = E. \n| last2 = Coll | first2 = M.

Generally one anemone contains a 'harem', consisting of a large female, a smaller reproductive male, and even smaller non-reproductive males. If the female is removed, the reproductive male will change sex and the largest of the non-reproductive males will mature and become reproductive. It has been shown that fishing pressure can change when the switch from male to female occurs, since fishermen usually prefer to catch the larger fish. The populations are generally changing sex at a smaller size, due to [[natural selection]].\n* '''Protogyny''': Where the organism is born as a female, and then changes sex to a male.<ref name=barrows/>\n** Example: [[wrasse]]s (Family [[Labridae]]) are a group of reef fish in which protogyny is common. Wrasses also have an uncommon life history strategy, which is termed diandry (literally, two males). In these species, two male morphs exists: an initial phase male and a terminal phase male. Initial phase males do not look like males and spawn in groups with other females. They are not territorial. They are, perhaps, female mimics (which is why they are found swimming in group with other females). Terminal phase males are territorial and have a distinctively bright coloration. Individuals are born as males or females, but if they are born males, they are not born as terminal phase males. Females and initial phase males can become terminal phase males. Usually, the most dominant female or initial phase male replaces any terminal phase male when those males die or abandon the group.\n*'''Bidirectional Sex Changers''': where an organism has female and male reproductive organs, but act as either female or male during different stages in life.<ref name=barrows/>\n**Example: [[Lythrypnus dalli]] (Family [[Lythrypnus]]) are a group of [[coral reef fish]] in which bidirectional sex change occurs. Once a social hierarchy is established a fish changes sex according to its social status, regardless of the initial sex, based on a simple principle: if the fish expresses subordinate behavior then it changes its sex to female, and if the fish expresses dominant or not subordinate behavior then the fish changes its sex to male.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rodgers|first=E.W.|author2=Early, R.L. |author3=Grober, M.S. |title=Social status determines sexual phenotype in the bi-directional sex changing bluebanded goby Lythrypnus dalli|journal=J Fish Biol|year=2007|volume=70|issue=6|pages=1660\u20131668|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01427.x}}</ref>\nDichogamy can have both conservation-related implications for humans, as mentioned above, as well as economic implications. For instance, [[grouper]]s are favoured fish for eating in many Asian countries and are often [[aquacultured]].

After exchange of [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]], both animals will lay fertilized eggs after a period of gestation; then the eggs will proceed to hatch after a development period. Snails typically reproduce in early spring and late autumn.\n*[[:Banana slug]]s are one example of a hermaphroditic gastropod. Mating with a partner is more desirable biologically, as the genetic material of the resultant offspring is varied, but if mating with a partner is not possible, self-fertilization is practiced. The male sexual organ of an adult banana slug is quite large in proportion to its size, as well as compared to the female organ. It is possible for banana slugs, while mating, to become stuck together. If a substantial amount of wiggling fails to separate them, the male organ will be bitten off (using the slug's [[radula]]), see [[apophallation]]. If a banana slug has lost its male sexual organ, it can still mate as a female, making its hermaphroditic quality a valuable adaptation.\n* The species of colourful [[sea slugs]] ''[[Goniobranchus reticulatus]]'' is hermaphroditic, with both male and female organs active at the same time during copulation.  After mating, the external portion of the penis detaches, but is able to regrow within 24 hours.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21431678 | title = Sea slug's 'disposable penis' surprises | author = Rebecca Morelle | date = 12 February 2013 | work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2012.1150 | title = Disposable penis and its replenishment in a simultaneous hermaphrodite | year = 2013 | last1 = Sekizawa | first1 = A. | last2 = Seki | first2 = S. | last3 = Tokuzato | first3 = M. | last4 = Shiga | first4 = S. | last5 = Nakashima | first5 = Y. | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 20121150 | pmid=23407499 | pmc=3639767}}</ref>\n* [[Hamlet (fish)|Hamlets]], unlike other fish, seem quite at ease mating in front of divers, allowing observations in the wild to occur readily. They do not practice self-fertilization, but when they find a mate, the pair takes turns between which one acts as the male and which acts as the female through multiple matings, usually over the course of several nights.\n* [[Earthworm]]s are another example of a simultaneous hermaphrodite. Although they possess ovaries and testes, they have a protective mechanism against self-fertilization. Sexual reproduction occurs when two worms meet and exchange [[gamete]]s, copulating on damp nights during warm seasons. Fertilized eggs are protected by a cocoon, which is buried on or near the surface of the ground.\n* The free-living hermaphroditic nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' reproduces primarily by self-fertilization, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of approximately 1%.<ref name=\"pmid16005289\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Barri\u00e8re A, F\u00e9lix MA|title=High local genetic diversity and low outcrossing rate in Caenorhabditis elegans natural populations |journal=Curr.

One possible pathophysiologic explanation of intersex in humans is a [[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]] division of a haploid ovum into two haploid ova. Upon fertilization of the two ova by two sperm cells (one carrying an [[X chromosome|X]] chromosome and the other carrying a [[Y chromosome|Y]] chromosome), the two [[zygote|fertilized ova]] are then [[Chimera (genetics)|fused together]] resulting in a person having dual genitalial, gonadal ([[ovotestes]]) and [[Sex-determination system|genetic sex]]. Another common cause of being intersex is the crossing over of the [[SRY]] from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome during [[meiosis]]. The SRY is then activated in only certain areas, causing development of [[testes]] in some areas by beginning a series of events starting with the upregulation of [[SOX9]], and in other areas not being active (causing the growth of [[ovarian]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s).

Although Lorenz did not discover the topic, he became widely known for his descriptions of imprinting as an instinctive  bond. In 1936 he met Tinbergen, and the two collaborated in developing ethology as a separate [[Biology#Branches|sub-discipline of biology]].

He is best known for his discovery of the principle of attachment, or [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]], through which in some species a bond is formed between a new born animal and its caregiver. This principle had been discovered by [[Douglas Spalding]] in the 19th century, and Lorenz's mentor Oskar Heinroth had also worked on the topic, but Lorenz's description of ''Pr\u00e4gung'', imprinting, in [[nidifugous]] birds such as greylag geese in his 1935 book ''Der Kumpan in der Umwelt des Vogels'' (\"The Companion in the Environment of Birds\") became the foundational description of the phenomenon.<ref name=patterns>Burkhardt, R. W. (2005). Patterns of behavior: Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and the founding of ethology. University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\nHere, Lorenz used [[Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll]]'s concept of [[Umwelt]] to understand how the limited perception of animals filtered out certain phenomena with which they interacted instinctively. For example, a young goose instinctively bonds with the first moving stimulus it perceives, whether it be its mother, or a person. Lorenz showed that this behavior of [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] is what allows the goose to learn to recognize members of its own species, enabling them to be the object of subsequent behavior patterns such as mating.<ref name=species /> He developed a theory of instinctive behavior that saw behavior patterns as largely innate but triggered through environmental stimuli, for example the [[hawk/goose effect]]. He argued that animals have an inner drive to carry out instinctive behaviors, and that if they do not encounter the right stimulus they will eventually engage in the behavior with an inappropriate stimulus.<ref>Yount, L. (2009). A to Z of Biologists. Infobase Publishing. pp. 183-184</ref>\n\nLorenz's approach to ethology derived from a skepticism towards the studies of animal behavior done in laboratory settings. He considered that in order to understand the mechanisms of animal behavior, it was necessary to observe their full range of behaviors in their natural context. Lorenz did not carry out much traditional fieldwork but observed animals near his home. His method involved empathizing with animals, often using anthropomorphization to imagine their mental states. He believed that animals were capable of experiencing many of the same emotions as humans.<ref name=species /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vicedo | first1 = M. | year = 2009 | title = The father of ethology and the foster mother of ducks: Konrad Lorenz as an Expert on Motherhood | journal = Isis | volume = 100 | issue = 2| pages = 263\u2013291 | doi=10.1086/599553| pmid = 19653490 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c4a32f19462b3ffe871015537acd7af386f02706 }}</ref>\n\nTinbergen, Lorenz's friend with whom he conjointly received the Nobel prize, summarized Lorenz's major contribution to ethology as making behavior a topic of biological inquiry, considering behavior a part of an animal's evolutionary equipment.<ref>Tinbergen, N.

Another of his contributions to ethology  is his work on [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]]. His influence on a younger generation of [[ethologists]]; and his popular works, were important in bringing ethology to the attention of the general public.\n\nLorenz claimed that there was widespread contempt for the descriptive sciences.

In his 1973 book, ''Civilized Man's Eight Deadly Sins'', Lorenz addresses the following paradox:\n\n<blockquote>All the advantages that man has gained from his ever-deepening understanding of the natural world that surrounds him, his technological, chemical and medical progress, all of which should seem to alleviate human suffering... tends instead to favor humanity's destruction<ref>{{cite book |title=Gli otto peccati capitali della nostra civilt\u00e0 |trans-title=Civilized Man's Eight Deadly Sins |publisher=[[Adelphi Edizioni]] |location=Milano |year=1974 |page=26 }} The citation is translated from the Italian version of the book.</ref></blockquote>\n\nLorenz adopts an ecological model to attempt to grasp the mechanisms behind this contradiction. Thus \"all species... are adapted to their environment... including not only inorganic components... but all the other living beings that inhabit the locality.\" p31.\n\nFundamental to Lorenz's theory of ecology is the function of [[negative feedback]] mechanisms, which, in hierarchical fashion, dampen impulses that occur beneath a certain threshold. The thresholds themselves are the product of the interaction of contrasting mechanisms. Thus pain and pleasure act as checks on each other:\n\n<blockquote>To gain a desired prey, a dog or wolf will do things that, in other contexts, they would shy away from: run through thorn bushes, jump into cold water and expose themselves to risks which would normally frighten them. All these inhibitory mechanisms... act as a counterweight to the effects of learning mechanisms... The organism cannot allow itself to pay a price which is not worth paying. p53.</blockquote>\n\nIn nature, these mechanisms tend towards a 'stable state' among the living beings of an ecology:\n\n<blockquote>A closer examination shows that these beings... not only do not damage each other, but often constitute a community of interests. It is obvious that the predator is strongly interested in the survival of that species, animal or vegetable, which constitutes its prey. ... It is not uncommon that the prey species derives specific benefits from its interaction with the predator species... pp31\u201333.</blockquote>\n\nLorenz states that humanity is the one species not bound by these mechanisms, being the only one that has defined its own environment:\n\n<blockquote>[The pace of human ecology] is determined by the progress of man's technology (p35)... human ecology (economy) is governed by mechanisms of POSITIVE feedback, defined  as a mechanism which tends to encourage behavior rather than to attenuate it (p43). Positive feedback always involves the danger of an 'avalanche' effect... One particular kind of positive feedback occurs when individuals OF THE SAME SPECIES enter into competition among themselves... For many animal species, environmental factors keep... intraspecies selection from [leading to] disaster... But there is no force which exercises this type of healthy regulatory effect on humanity's cultural development; unfortunately for itself, humanity has learned to overcome  all those environmental forces which are external to itself p44.</blockquote>\n\nRegarding aggression in human beings, Lorenz states:\n\n<blockquote>Let us imagine that an absolutely unbiased investigator on another planet, perhaps on Mars, is examining human behavior on earth, with the aid of a telescope whose magnification is too small to enable him to discern individuals and follow their separate behavior, but large enough for him to observe occurrences such as migrations of peoples, wars, and similar great historical events. He would never gain the impression that human behavior was dictated by intelligence, still less by responsible morality. If we suppose our extraneous observer to be a being of pure reason, devoid of instincts himself and unaware of the way in which all instincts in general and aggression in particular can miscarry, he would be at a complete loss how to explain history at all. The ever-recurrent phenomena of history do not have reasonable causes. It is a mere commonplace to say that they are caused by what common parlance so aptly terms \"human nature.\" Unreasoning and unreasonable human nature causes two nations to compete, though no economic necessity compels them to do so; it induces two political parties or religions with amazingly similar programs of salvation to fight each other bitterly, and it impels an Alexander or a Napoleon to sacrifice millions of lives in his attempt to unite the world under his scepter. We have been taught to regard some of the persons who have committed these and similar absurdities with respect, even as \"great\" men, we are wont to yield to the political wisdom of those in charge, and we are all so accustomed to these phenomena that most of us fail to realize how abjectly stupid and undesirable the historical mass behavior of humanity actually is <ref>LORENZ, Konrad.

Zur Naturgeschichte der Aggression. Viena: Dr. G. Borotha-Schoeler Verlag, 1963, p. 263.</ref></blockquote>\n\nLorenz does not see human independence from natural ecological processes as necessarily bad. Indeed, he states that:\n\n<blockquote>A completely new [ecology] which corresponds in every way to [humanity's] desires... could, theoretically, prove as durable as that which would have existed without his intervention (36).</blockquote>\n\nHowever, the principle of competition, typical of Western societies, destroys any chance of this:\n\n<blockquote>The competition between human beings destroys with cold and diabolic brutality... Under the pressure of this competitive fury we have not only forgotten what is useful to humanity as a whole, but even that which is good and advantageous to the individual. [...] One asks, which is more damaging to modern humanity: the thirst for money or consuming haste... in either case, fear plays a very important role: the fear of being overtaken by one's competitors,  the fear of becoming poor, the fear of making wrong decisions or the fear of not being up to snuff... pp45\u201347.</blockquote>\n\nIn this book, Lorenz proposes that the best hope for mankind lies in our looking for mates based on the kindness of their hearts rather than good looks or wealth. He illustrates this with a Jewish story, explicitly described as such.\n\nLorenz was one of the early scientists who recognised the significance of [[human overpopulation]]. The number one deadly sin of civilized man in his book is overpopulation, which is what leads to aggression.\n\n=== Philosophical speculations ===\nIn his 1973 book ''[[Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge]]'', Lorenz considers the old philosophical question of whether our senses correctly inform us about the world as it is, or provide us only with an illusion. His answer comes from [[evolutionary biology]]. Only traits that help us survive and reproduce are transmitted. If our senses gave us wrong information about our environment, we would soon be extinct.

Lorenz began to suspect and fear \"that analogous processes of deterioration may be at work with civilized humanity.\" This observation of bird hybrids caused Lorenz to believe that domestication resulting from urbanisation in humans might also cause [[dysgenic]] effects, and to argue in two papers that the [[Nazi eugenics]] policies against this were therefore scientifically justified.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Klopfer |first=Peter |year=1994 |title=Konrad Lorenz and the National Socialists: On the Politics of Ethology |journal=International Journal of Comparative Psychology |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=202\u2013208 |doi= |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/50b5r4d6 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Konrad lorenz-rusky lagr 1944-fotka.jpg|upright|thumb|Lorenz as a [[German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|Soviet POW]] in 1944]]\n\nIn 1940 he became a professor of [[psychology]] at the [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg]].

He is best known for his discovery of the principle of attachment, or [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]], through which in some species a bond is formed between a new born animal and its caregiver. This principle had been discovered by [[Douglas Spalding]] in the 19th century, and Lorenz's mentor Oskar Heinroth had also worked on the topic, but Lorenz's description of ''Pr\u00e4gung'', imprinting, in [[nidifugous]] birds such as greylag geese in his 1935 book ''Der Kumpan in der Umwelt des Vogels'' (\"The Companion in the Environment of Birds\") became the foundational description of the phenomenon.<ref name=patterns>Burkhardt, R. W. (2005). Patterns of behavior: Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and the founding of ethology. University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\nHere, Lorenz used [[Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll]]'s concept of [[Umwelt]] to understand how the limited perception of animals filtered out certain phenomena with which they interacted instinctively. For example, a young goose instinctively bonds with the first moving stimulus it perceives, whether it be its mother, or a person. Lorenz showed that this behavior of [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] is what allows the goose to learn to recognize members of its own species, enabling them to be the object of subsequent behavior patterns such as mating.<ref name=species /> He developed a theory of instinctive behavior that saw behavior patterns as largely innate but triggered through environmental stimuli, for example the [[hawk/goose effect]]. He argued that animals have an inner drive to carry out instinctive behaviors, and that if they do not encounter the right stimulus they will eventually engage in the behavior with an inappropriate stimulus.<ref>Yount, L. (2009). A to Z of Biologists. Infobase Publishing. pp. 183-184</ref>\n\nLorenz's approach to ethology derived from a skepticism towards the studies of animal behavior done in laboratory settings. He considered that in order to understand the mechanisms of animal behavior, it was necessary to observe their full range of behaviors in their natural context. Lorenz did not carry out much traditional fieldwork but observed animals near his home. His method involved empathizing with animals, often using anthropomorphization to imagine their mental states. He believed that animals were capable of experiencing many of the same emotions as humans.<ref name=species /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vicedo | first1 = M. | year = 2009 | title = The father of ethology and the foster mother of ducks: Konrad Lorenz as an Expert on Motherhood | journal = Isis | volume = 100 | issue = 2| pages = 263\u2013291 | doi=10.1086/599553| pmid = 19653490 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c4a32f19462b3ffe871015537acd7af386f02706 }}</ref>\n\nTinbergen, Lorenz's friend with whom he conjointly received the Nobel prize, summarized Lorenz's major contribution to ethology as making behavior a topic of biological inquiry, considering behavior a part of an animal's evolutionary equipment.<ref>Tinbergen, N.

I do not want to extenuate this action. I did, indeed, believe that some good might come of the new rulers. The [[Fatherland's Front|precedent narrow-minded catholic regime]] in Austria induced better and more intelligent men than I was to cherish this naive hope. Practically all my friends and teachers did so, including my own father who certainly was a kindly and humane man.

They experimented with \"[[Supernormal stimulus|supernormal stimuli]]\" such as giant eggs or dummy bird beaks which they found could release the fixed action patterns more powerfully than the natural objects for which the behaviors were adapted. Influenced by the ideas of [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]], Lorenz developed this into a \"psychohydraulic\" model of the [[motivation]] of behavior, which tended towards [[group selection]]ist ideas, which were influential in the 1960s. Another of his contributions to ethology  is his work on [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]]. His influence on a younger generation of [[ethologists]]; and his popular works, were important in bringing ethology to the attention of the general public.\n\nLorenz claimed that there was widespread contempt for the descriptive sciences. He attributed this to the denial of perception as the source of all scientific knowledge: \"a denial that has been elevated to the status of religion.\"<ref name=Lorenz1979>{{cite book |year=1979 |last=Lorenz |first=Konrad |title=The Year of the Greylag Goose |place=London |publisher=[[Eyre Methuen]] |page=6}}</ref> He wrote that in comparative behavioral research, \"it is necessary to describe various patterns of movement, record them, and above all, render them unmistakably recognizable.\"<ref name=Lorenz1979p7>Lorenz (1979), p. 7.</ref>\n\nThere are three research institutions named after Lorenz in Austria: the  [[Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research|Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research (KLI)]] was housed in Lorenz' family mansion at Altenberg before moving to [[Klosterneuburg]] in 2013 [http://www.kli.ac.at/]; the [[Konrad Lorenz Forschungsstelle]] (KLF) at his former field station in Gr\u00fcnau; and the [[Konrad Lorenz Institute of Ethology]], an external research facility of the [[University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna]].\n\n=== Vision of the challenges facing humanity ===\n[[File:Lorenz and Tinbergen2.jpg|thumb|With Nikolaas Tinbergen (right), 1978]]\n\nLorenz predicted the relationship between market economics and the threat of ecological catastrophe. In his 1973 book, ''Civilized Man's Eight Deadly Sins'', Lorenz addresses the following paradox:\n\n<blockquote>All the advantages that man has gained from his ever-deepening understanding of the natural world that surrounds him, his technological, chemical and medical progress, all of which should seem to alleviate human suffering... tends instead to favor humanity's destruction<ref>{{cite book |title=Gli otto peccati capitali della nostra civilt\u00e0 |trans-title=Civilized Man's Eight Deadly Sins |publisher=[[Adelphi Edizioni]] |location=Milano |year=1974 |page=26 }} The citation is translated from the Italian version of the book.</ref></blockquote>\n\nLorenz adopts an ecological model to attempt to grasp the mechanisms behind this contradiction. Thus \"all species... are adapted to their environment... including not only inorganic components... but all the other living beings that inhabit the locality.\" p31.\n\nFundamental to Lorenz's theory of ecology is the function of [[negative feedback]] mechanisms, which, in hierarchical fashion, dampen impulses that occur beneath a certain threshold. The thresholds themselves are the product of the interaction of contrasting mechanisms. Thus pain and pleasure act as checks on each other:\n\n<blockquote>To gain a desired prey, a dog or wolf will do things that, in other contexts, they would shy away from: run through thorn bushes, jump into cold water and expose themselves to risks which would normally frighten them. All these inhibitory mechanisms... act as a counterweight to the effects of learning mechanisms... The organism cannot allow itself to pay a price which is not worth paying. p53.</blockquote>\n\nIn nature, these mechanisms tend towards a 'stable state' among the living beings of an ecology:\n\n<blockquote>A closer examination shows that these beings... not only do not damage each other, but often constitute a community of interests. It is obvious that the predator is strongly interested in the survival of that species, animal or vegetable, which constitutes its prey. ... It is not uncommon that the prey species derives specific benefits from its interaction with the predator species... pp31\u201333.</blockquote>\n\nLorenz states that humanity is the one species not bound by these mechanisms, being the only one that has defined its own environment:\n\n<blockquote>[The pace of human ecology] is determined by the progress of man's technology (p35)... human ecology (economy) is governed by mechanisms of POSITIVE feedback, defined  as a mechanism which tends to encourage behavior rather than to attenuate it (p43). Positive feedback always involves the danger of an 'avalanche' effect... One particular kind of positive feedback occurs when individuals OF THE SAME SPECIES enter into competition among themselves... For many animal species, environmental factors keep... intraspecies selection from [leading to] disaster... But there is no force which exercises this type of healthy regulatory effect on humanity's cultural development; unfortunately for itself, humanity has learned to overcome  all those environmental forces which are external to itself p44.</blockquote>\n\nRegarding aggression in human beings, Lorenz states:\n\n<blockquote>Let us imagine that an absolutely unbiased investigator on another planet, perhaps on Mars, is examining human behavior on earth, with the aid of a telescope whose magnification is too small to enable him to discern individuals and follow their separate behavior, but large enough for him to observe occurrences such as migrations of peoples, wars, and similar great historical events. He would never gain the impression that human behavior was dictated by intelligence, still less by responsible morality. If we suppose our extraneous observer to be a being of pure reason, devoid of instincts himself and unaware of the way in which all instincts in general and aggression in particular can miscarry, he would be at a complete loss how to explain history at all. The ever-recurrent phenomena of history do not have reasonable causes. It is a mere commonplace to say that they are caused by what common parlance so aptly terms \"human nature.\" Unreasoning and unreasonable human nature causes two nations to compete, though no economic necessity compels them to do so; it induces two political parties or religions with amazingly similar programs of salvation to fight each other bitterly, and it impels an Alexander or a Napoleon to sacrifice millions of lives in his attempt to unite the world under his scepter. We have been taught to regard some of the persons who have committed these and similar absurdities with respect, even as \"great\" men, we are wont to yield to the political wisdom of those in charge, and we are all so accustomed to these phenomena that most of us fail to realize how abjectly stupid and undesirable the historical mass behavior of humanity actually is <ref>LORENZ, Konrad. ''On Aggression''. New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, 1966. Translated by Marjorie Kerr Wilson. Originally published in Austria under the title DAS SOGENANNTE B\u00d6SE. Zur Naturgeschichte der Aggression. Viena: Dr. G. Borotha-Schoeler Verlag, 1963, p. 263.</ref></blockquote>\n\nLorenz does not see human independence from natural ecological processes as necessarily bad. Indeed, he states that:\n\n<blockquote>A completely new [ecology] which corresponds in every way to [humanity's] desires... could, theoretically, prove as durable as that which would have existed without his intervention (36).</blockquote>\n\nHowever, the principle of competition, typical of Western societies, destroys any chance of this:\n\n<blockquote>The competition between human beings destroys with cold and diabolic brutality... Under the pressure of this competitive fury we have not only forgotten what is useful to humanity as a whole, but even that which is good and advantageous to the individual. [...] One asks, which is more damaging to modern humanity: the thirst for money or consuming haste... in either case, fear plays a very important role: the fear of being overtaken by one's competitors,  the fear of becoming poor, the fear of making wrong decisions or the fear of not being up to snuff... pp45\u201347.</blockquote>\n\nIn this book, Lorenz proposes that the best hope for mankind lies in our looking for mates based on the kindness of their hearts rather than good looks or wealth. He illustrates this with a Jewish story, explicitly described as such.\n\nLorenz was one of the early scientists who recognised the significance of [[human overpopulation]]. The number one deadly sin of civilized man in his book is overpopulation, which is what leads to aggression.\n\n=== Philosophical speculations ===\nIn his 1973 book ''[[Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge]]'', Lorenz considers the old philosophical question of whether our senses correctly inform us about the world as it is, or provide us only with an illusion. His answer comes from [[evolutionary biology]]. Only traits that help us survive and reproduce are transmitted. If our senses gave us wrong information about our environment, we would soon be extinct. Therefore, we can be sure that our senses give us correct information, for otherwise we would not be here to be deceived.\n\n== Honours and awards ==\n* [[Austrian Decoration for Science and Art]] in 1964\n* Elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1964|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1964]]<ref name=formemrs />\n* [[Kalinga Prize]] for the Popularization of Science in 1969\n* Gold Medal of the Humboldt Society in 1972{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1973<ref name=\"Nobelprize.org\"/>\n* Honorary Doctorate, University of Salzburg, 1983, revoked in 2015<ref>FAZ 2015 (http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/titel-erschlichen-uni-salzburg-entzieht-konrad-lorenz-die-ehrendoktorwuerde-13973531.html)</ref>\n* Grand Cross with Star and Sash of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] (''Gro\u00dfes Verdienstkreuz mit Stern und Schulterband'') in 1984\n* [[Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art]] in 1984\n\n== Works ==\nLorenz's best-known books are ''[[King Solomon's Ring (nonfiction)|King Solomon's Ring]]'' and ''[[On Aggression]]'', both written for a popular audience.

Lewis taught briefly at [[UCLA]] and then at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] from 1970 until his death.  He is also closely associated with [[Australia]], whose philosophical community he visited almost annually for more than thirty years. He made contributions in [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of probability]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophical logic]], and [[aesthetics]]. He is probably best known for his controversial [[modal realism|modal realist]] stance: <br/ >(i) [[Possible World|Possible worlds]] exist. <br/ >(ii) Every possible world is a concrete entity. <br/ >(iii) Any possible world is causally and spatiotemporally isolated from any other possible world. <br/ >(iv) Our world is among the possible worlds.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLewis was born in [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]], [[Ohio]], to John D. Lewis, a Professor of Government at [[Oberlin College]], and Ruth Ewart Kelloggs Lewis, a distinguished medieval historian. The formidable intellect for which he was known later in his life was already manifest during his years at [[Oberlin High School (Ohio)|Oberlin High School]], when he attended college lectures in [[chemistry]]. He went on to [[Swarthmore College]] and spent a year at [[Oxford University]] (1959\u20131960), where he was tutored by [[Iris Murdoch]] and attended lectures by [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[H.P. Grice]], [[P.F. Strawson]], and [[J.L. Austin]]. It was his year at Oxford that played a seminal role in his decision to study philosophy, and which made him the quintessentially [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher that he would soon become. Lewis went on to receive his Ph.D from [[Harvard]] in 1967, where he studied under [[W.V.O. Quine]], many of whose views he came to repudiate. It was there that his connection with [[Australia]] was first established when he took a seminar with [[J.J.C. Smart]], a leading Australian philosopher. \"I taught David Lewis,\" Smart would say in later years, \"Or rather, he taught me.\"\n\n== Early work on convention ==\nLewis's first monograph was <cite>''Convention: A Philosophical Study''</cite> (1969), which is based on his doctoral dissertation and uses concepts of [[game theory]] to analyze the nature of social conventions; it won the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s first Franklin Matchette Prize for the best book published in philosophy by a philosopher under 40 years old. Lewis claimed that social conventions, such as the convention in most states that one drives on the right (not on the left), the convention that the original caller will re-call if a phone conversation is interrupted, etc., are solutions to so-called \"'co-ordination problems'\". Co-ordination problems were at the time of Lewis's book an under-discussed kind of game-theoretical problem; most of the game-theoretical discussion had circulated around problems where the participants are in conflict, such as the [[prisoner's dilemma]].\n\nCo-ordination problems are problematic, for, though the participants have common interests, there are several solutions. Sometimes, one of the solutions may be \"'salient'\", a concept invented by the game-theorist and economist [[Thomas Schelling]] (by whom Lewis was much inspired). For example, a co-ordination problem that has the form of a meeting may have a salient solution if there is only one possible spot to meet in town. But in most cases, we must rely on what Lewis calls \"precedent\" in order to get a salient solution. If both participants know that a particular co-ordination problem, say \"which side should we drive on?\" has been solved in the same way numerous times before, both know that both know this, both know that both know that both know this, etc. (this particular state Lewis calls [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]], and it has since been much discussed by philosophers and game theorists), then they will easily solve the problem. That they have solved the problem successfully will be seen by even more people, and thus the convention will spread in the society. A convention is thus a behavioral regularity that sustains itself because it serves the interests of everyone involved. Another important feature of a convention is that a convention could be entirely different: one could just as well drive on the left; it is more or less arbitrary that one drives on the right in the US, for example.\n\nLewis's main goal in the book, however, wasn't simply to provide an account of convention but rather to investigate the \"platitude that language is ruled by convention\" (<cite>Convention</cite>, p.&nbsp;1.) The last two chapters of the book (<cite>Signalling Systems</cite> and <cite>Conventions of Language</cite>; cf. also \"Languages and Language\", 1975) make the case that the use of a language in a population consists of conventions of truthfulness and trust among members of the population. Lewis recasts in this framework notions such as those of truth and analyticity, claiming that they are better understood as relations between sentences and a language, rather than as properties of sentences.\n\n== Counterfactuals and modal realism ==\n<!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:DavidLewis.jpg|thumb|David Lewis]] because is politician -->\n\nLewis went on to publish <cite>Counterfactuals</cite> (1973), which contained an analysis of [[counterfactual conditionals]] in terms of the theory of [[possible worlds]]. According to Lewis, what makes a statement of the form\n<blockquote>Had I made that shot our team would have won the game.</blockquote>\ntrue is that in any world where I make the shot but the world is otherwise as similar as possible to the actual one, our team wins the game. If there is a world maximally similar to ours where I make the shot but our team still loses, the counterfactual is false. This treatment of counterfactuals is a variation or generalization of the one published by [[Robert Stalnaker]] a few years earlier, and consequently this kind of treatment is called the [[Counterfactual conditional#Possible world semantics|Stalnaker-Lewis theory]].\n\n===Realism about possible worlds===\nWhat made Lewis's views about counterfactuals controversial is that whereas Stalnaker treated possible worlds as imaginary entities, \"made up\" for the sake of theoretical convenience, Lewis adopted a position his formal account of counterfactuals did not commit him to, namely [[modal realism]]. According to this view as Lewis formulated it, when we speak of a world where I made the shot that in this world I missed, we are speaking of a world just as real as this one, and although we say that in that world I made the shot, more precisely it is not I but a ''[[counterpart theory|counterpart]]'' of mine that was successful.\n\nHe had already proposed this view in some of his earlier papers: \"Counterpart Theory and Quantified Modal Logic\" (1968), \"Anselm and Actuality\" (1970), and \"Counterparts of Persons and their Bodies\" (1971). The theory was widely considered implausible, but Lewis urged that it should be taken seriously. Most often the idea that there exists an infinite number of causally isolated universes, each as real as our own but different from it in some way, and that furthermore that alluding to objects in this universe as necessary in order to explain what makes certain counterfactual statements true but not others, meets with what Lewis calls the \"incredulous stare\" (Lewis, OPW, 2005, pg. 135\u2013137). Lewis defends and elaborates his theory of extreme modal realism, while insisting that there is nothing extreme about it, in <cite>[[On the Plurality of Worlds]]</cite> (1986). Lewis acknowledges that his theory is contrary to common sense, but believes that its advantages far outweigh this disadvantage, and that therefore we should not be hesitant to pay this price.\n\nAccording to Lewis, \"actual\" is merely an indexical label we give to a world when we locate ourselves in it. Things are [[logical truth|necessarily true]] when they are true in all possible worlds. (Note that Lewis is not the first one to speak of possible worlds in this context. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[C.I. Lewis]], for example, both speak of possible worlds as a way of thinking about possibility and necessity, and some of [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]]'s early work is on the counterpart theory. Lewis's original suggestion was that all possible worlds are equally concrete, and the world in which we find ourselves is no more real than any other possible world.)\n\n=== Criticisms ===\nThis theory has faced a number of criticisms. In particular, it is not clear how we could know what goes on in other worlds. After all, they are causally disconnected from ours; we can't look into them to see what is going on there.<ref>Stalnaker, ''Inquiry'', p. 49: \"But if other possible worlds are causally disconnected from us, how do we know anything about them?\"</ref> A related objection is that, while people are concerned with what they could have done, they are not concerned with what some people in other worlds, no matter how similar to them, do. As [[Saul Kripke]] once put it, a presidential candidate could not care less whether someone else, in another world, wins an election, but does care whether he himself could have won it (Kripke 1980, p.&nbsp;45). \n\nAnother criticism of the realist approach to possible worlds is of it having an inflated [[ontology]]. That by extending the property of concreteness to more than the singular actual world it multiplies theoretical entities beyond what should be necessary to its explanatory aims, thereby violating the principle of parsimony, [[Occam's razor]]. However, the opposite position could be taken on the view that the modal realist reduces the categories of possible worlds by eliminating the special case of the actual world as the exception to possible worlds as simple abstractions.  \n\n\nPossible worlds are employed in the work of [[Saul Kripke]]<ref>''[[Naming and Necessity|\"Naming and Necessity\", In Semantics of Natural Language, edited by D. Davidson and G. Harman. 1980 (1972) Dordrecht; Boston: Reidel.]]''</ref> and many others, but not in the concrete sense propounded by Lewis. While none of these alternative approaches has found anything near universal acceptance, very few philosophers accept Lewis's particular brand of modal realism.\n\n=== Influence ===\nAt Princeton, Lewis was a mentor of young philosophers, and trained dozens of successful figures in the field, including several current Princeton faculty members, as well as people now teaching at a number of the leading philosophy departments in the U.S. Among his most prominent students are [[Robert Brandom|Bob Brandom]] at the University of Pittsburgh, [[L.A. Paul]] at Yale, [[Cian Dorr]] and [[David Velleman]] at NYU, [[Peter Railton]] at Michigan, and [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] at Harvard. His direct and indirect influence is evident in the work of many prominent philosophers of the current generation.\n\n== Later life and death ==\n\nLewis suffered from severe [[diabetes]] for much of his life, which eventually grew worse and led to [[kidney]] failure. In July 2000 he received a [[kidney transplant]] from his wife Stephanie. The transplant allowed him to work and travel for another year, before he died suddenly and unexpectedly from further complications of his diabetes, on October 14, 2001.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=David Kellogg Lewis |quote= David Kellogg Lewis, a metaphysician and a philosopher of mind, language and logic at Princeton University, died on Sunday at his home in Princeton, N.J.

Lewis taught briefly at [[UCLA]] and then at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] from 1970 until his death.  He is also closely associated with [[Australia]], whose philosophical community he visited almost annually for more than thirty years. He made contributions in [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of probability]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophical logic]], and [[aesthetics]]. He is probably best known for his controversial [[modal realism|modal realist]] stance: <br/ >(i) [[Possible World|Possible worlds]] exist. <br/ >(ii) Every possible world is a concrete entity. <br/ >(iii) Any possible world is causally and spatiotemporally isolated from any other possible world. <br/ >(iv) Our world is among the possible worlds.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLewis was born in [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]], [[Ohio]], to John D. Lewis, a Professor of Government at [[Oberlin College]], and Ruth Ewart Kelloggs Lewis, a distinguished medieval historian. The formidable intellect for which he was known later in his life was already manifest during his years at [[Oberlin High School (Ohio)|Oberlin High School]], when he attended college lectures in [[chemistry]]. He went on to [[Swarthmore College]] and spent a year at [[Oxford University]] (1959\u20131960), where he was tutored by [[Iris Murdoch]] and attended lectures by [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[H.P. Grice]], [[P.F. Strawson]], and [[J.L. Austin]]. It was his year at Oxford that played a seminal role in his decision to study philosophy, and which made him the quintessentially [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher that he would soon become. Lewis went on to receive his Ph.D from [[Harvard]] in 1967, where he studied under [[W.V.O. Quine]], many of whose views he came to repudiate. It was there that his connection with [[Australia]] was first established when he took a seminar with [[J.J.C. Smart]], a leading Australian philosopher. \"I taught David Lewis,\" Smart would say in later years, \"Or rather, he taught me.\"\n\n== Early work on convention ==\nLewis's first monograph was <cite>''Convention: A Philosophical Study''</cite> (1969), which is based on his doctoral dissertation and uses concepts of [[game theory]] to analyze the nature of social conventions; it won the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s first Franklin Matchette Prize for the best book published in philosophy by a philosopher under 40 years old. Lewis claimed that social conventions, such as the convention in most states that one drives on the right (not on the left), the convention that the original caller will re-call if a phone conversation is interrupted, etc., are solutions to so-called \"'co-ordination problems'\". Co-ordination problems were at the time of Lewis's book an under-discussed kind of game-theoretical problem; most of the game-theoretical discussion had circulated around problems where the participants are in conflict, such as the [[prisoner's dilemma]].\n\nCo-ordination problems are problematic, for, though the participants have common interests, there are several solutions. Sometimes, one of the solutions may be \"'salient'\", a concept invented by the game-theorist and economist [[Thomas Schelling]] (by whom Lewis was much inspired). For example, a co-ordination problem that has the form of a meeting may have a salient solution if there is only one possible spot to meet in town. But in most cases, we must rely on what Lewis calls \"precedent\" in order to get a salient solution. If both participants know that a particular co-ordination problem, say \"which side should we drive on?\" has been solved in the same way numerous times before, both know that both know this, both know that both know that both know this, etc. (this particular state Lewis calls [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]], and it has since been much discussed by philosophers and game theorists), then they will easily solve the problem. That they have solved the problem successfully will be seen by even more people, and thus the convention will spread in the society. A convention is thus a behavioural regularity that sustains itself because it serves the interests of everyone involved. Another important feature of a convention is that a convention could be entirely different: one could just as well drive on the left; it is more or less arbitrary that one drives on the right in the US, for example.\n\nLewis's main goal in the book, however, wasn't simply to provide an account of convention but rather to investigate the \"platitude that language is ruled by convention\" (<cite>Convention</cite>, p.&nbsp;1.) The last two chapters of the book (<cite>Signalling Systems</cite> and <cite>Conventions of Language</cite>; cf. also \"Languages and Language\", 1975) make the case that the use of a language in a population consists of conventions of truthfulness and trust among members of the population. Lewis recasts in this framework notions such as those of truth and analyticity, claiming that they are better understood as relations between sentences and a language, rather than as properties of sentences.\n\n== Counterfactuals and modal realism ==\n<!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:DavidLewis.jpg|thumb|David Lewis]] because is politician -->\n\nLewis went on to publish <cite>Counterfactuals</cite> (1973), which contained an analysis of [[counterfactual conditionals]] in terms of the theory of [[possible worlds]]. According to Lewis, what makes a statement of the form\n<blockquote>Had I made that shot our team would have won the game.</blockquote>\ntrue is that in any world where I make the shot but the world is otherwise as similar as possible to the actual one, our team wins the game. If there is a world maximally similar to ours where I make the shot but our team still loses, the counterfactual is false. This treatment of counterfactuals is a variation or generalization of the one published by [[Robert Stalnaker]] a few years earlier, and consequently this kind of treatment is called the [[Counterfactual conditional#Possible world semantics|Stalnaker-Lewis theory]].\n\n===Realism about possible worlds===\nWhat made Lewis's views about counterfactuals controversial is that whereas Stalnaker treated possible worlds as imaginary entities, \"made up\" for the sake of theoretical convenience, Lewis adopted a position his formal account of counterfactuals did not commit him to, namely [[modal realism]]. According to this view as Lewis formulated it, when we speak of a world where I made the shot that in this world I missed, we are speaking of a world just as real as this one, and although we say that in that world I made the shot, more precisely it is not I but a ''[[counterpart theory|counterpart]]'' of mine that was successful.\n\nHe had already proposed this view in some of his earlier papers: \"Counterpart Theory and Quantified Modal Logic\" (1968), \"Anselm and Actuality\" (1970), and \"Counterparts of Persons and their Bodies\" (1971). The theory was widely considered implausible, but Lewis urged that it should be taken seriously. Most often the idea that there exists an infinite number of causally isolated universes, each as real as our own but different from it in some way, and that furthermore that alluding to objects in this universe as necessary in order to explain what makes certain counterfactual statements true but not others, meets with what Lewis calls the \"incredulous stare\" (Lewis, OPW, 2005, pg. 135\u2013137). Lewis defends and elaborates his theory of extreme modal realism, while insisting that there is nothing extreme about it, in <cite>[[On the Plurality of Worlds]]</cite> (1986). Lewis acknowledges that his theory is contrary to common sense, but believes that its advantages far outweigh this disadvantage, and that therefore we should not be hesitant to pay this price.\n\nAccording to Lewis, \"actual\" is merely an indexical label we give to a world when we locate ourselves in it. Things are [[logical truth|necessarily true]] when they are true in all possible worlds. (Note that Lewis is not the first one to speak of possible worlds in this context. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[C.I. Lewis]], for example, both speak of possible worlds as a way of thinking about possibility and necessity, and some of [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]]'s early work is on the counterpart theory. Lewis's original suggestion was that all possible worlds are equally concrete, and the world in which we find ourselves is no more real than any other possible world.)\n\n=== Criticisms ===\nThis theory has faced a number of criticisms. In particular, it is not clear how we could know what goes on in other worlds. After all, they are causally disconnected from ours; we can't look into them to see what is going on there.<ref>Stalnaker, ''Inquiry'', p. 49: \"But if other possible worlds are causally disconnected from us, how do we know anything about them?\"</ref> A related objection is that, while people are concerned with what they could have done, they are not concerned with what some people in other worlds, no matter how similar to them, do. As [[Saul Kripke]] once put it, a presidential candidate could not care less whether someone else, in another world, wins an election, but does care whether he himself could have won it (Kripke 1980, p.&nbsp;45). \n\nAnother criticism of the realist approach to possible worlds is of it having an inflated [[ontology]]. That by extending the property of concreteness to more than the singular actual world it multiplies theoretical entities beyond what should be necessary to its explanatory aims, thereby violating the principle of parsimony, [[Occam's razor]]. However, the opposite position could be taken on the view that the modal realist reduces the categories of possible worlds by eliminating the special case of the actual world as the exception to possible worlds as simple abstractions. \n\n\nPossible worlds are employed in the work of [[Saul Kripke]]<ref>''[[Naming and Necessity|\"Naming and Necessity\", In Semantics of Natural Language, edited by D. Davidson and G. Harman. 1980 (1972) Dordrecht; Boston: Reidel.]]''</ref> and many others, but not in the concrete sense propounded by Lewis. While none of these alternative approaches has found anything near universal acceptance, very few philosophers accept Lewis's particular brand of modal realism.\n\n=== Influence ===\nAt Princeton, Lewis was a mentor of young philosophers, and trained dozens of successful figures in the field, including several current Princeton faculty members, as well as people now teaching at a number of the leading philosophy departments in the U.S. Among his most prominent students are [[Robert Brandom|Bob Brandom]] at the University of Pittsburgh, [[L.A. Paul]] at Yale, [[Cian Dorr]] and [[David Velleman]] at NYU, [[Peter Railton]] at Michigan, and [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] at Harvard. His direct and indirect influence is evident in the work of many prominent philosophers of the current generation.\n\n== Later life and death ==\n\nLewis suffered from severe [[diabetes]] for much of his life, which eventually grew worse and led to [[kidney]] failure. In July 2000 he received a [[kidney transplant]] from his wife Stephanie. The transplant allowed him to work and travel for another year, before he died suddenly and unexpectedly from further complications of his diabetes, on October 14, 2001.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=David Kellogg Lewis |quote= David Kellogg Lewis, a metaphysician and a philosopher of mind, language and logic at Princeton University, died on Sunday at his home in Princeton, N.J.
