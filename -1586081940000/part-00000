It finally separated from University of Tehran by parliamentary legislation in 1986, coming under the new Ministry of Health, Treatment, and [[Medical]] Education.\n\nTUMS is ranked as one of Iran's top research universities, with an annual research budget of over 300 billion Rials from the government. The school trains over 13,000 students (40% of whom are women) in approximately 290 undergraduate, graduate and non-degree (short-course) programs. The university has 11 schools, operates 16 teaching hospitals, is equipped with over 44 libraries, and publishes 58 journals, some in collaboration with academic societies.\n\nThe university operates [[The National Museum of Medical Sciences History (Iran)|The National Museum of Medical Sciences History]] as well.\nTUMS is accredited with Premier Status by [[Accreditation Service for International Colleges|Accreditation Service for International Colleges and Universities (ASIC UK)]]\n\n== History ==\nBefore the establishment of Dar-ol-Fonoon, there was no systematic approach to medical education in [[Iran]]. In 1851, Dar-ol-Fonoon School was established and medicine was considered as one of its main subjects. The first group of the Schools\u2019 graduates started practicing medicine in 1856. The Dar-ol-Fonoon School of Medicine can be considered as the first modern college of higher education in Iran. In 1918, medicine was deleted from the syllabus of Dar-ol-Fonoon and started to be taught in a separate independent college named \u201cCollege of Medicine\u201d and in the Same year, the first women\u2019s hospital was officially inaugurated. In 1934, the National Consultative Assembly ratified establishment of the University of Tehran to bring together the institutions of higher education, and the government purchased a 200,000 square meter tract in Tehran. The University of Tehran actually started its operation with the six Schools of Medicine, Law, Political Sciences, Science, Letters, Engineering, and Theology. At the same time, the main chairs of the School of Medicine including medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry were determined. On February 4, 1934, the Department of Anatomy was inaugurated as the first step to establishing the School of Medicine in the main campus of [[University of Tehran]]. In 1939, the University started offering doctorate degrees in pharmacy and dentistry. In the following year, all of the hospitals in Tehran were affiliated to the School of Medicine. Finally, in 1956 the Schools of Pharmacy and Dentistry were granted their academic independence.\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1986, the Islamic Consultative Assembly ratified a bill for the establishment of the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education. Since then, education of medicine and related disciplines, which had been performed under the supervision of the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology came under the jurisdiction of Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education. In line with this policy, universities of medical sciences were established and Tehran University of Medical Sciences, separating from the University of Tehran, came to existence to continue operating independently. Upon the emergence of regional health organizations in the universities of medical sciences in 1994, the mentioned universities, including Tehran University of Medical Sciences, came to assume the responsibility of rendering health care services while offering medical education.\n\n== Schools ==\nTehran University of Medical Sciences includes 10 different Schools<ref>{{cite web|title=TUMS Schools|url=http://gsia.tums.ac.ir/en/news/7523/Our-Schools|website=Gsia.tums.ac.ir|accessdate=15 August 2018}}</ref> (11 with [http://gsia.tums.ac.ir/en/page/10967/Virtual-School Virtual School]) which deal with various academical studies related to medical sciences.\n\n=== School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine ===\nOne of the Medical Schools is School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine (SATIM). This school was established in 2008 and tried to focus on connection between science and technology. Now it offers 5 major fields which accept Ph.D. students including \"Medical Biotechnology\", \"Molecular Medicine\", \"Medical Nanotechnology\", \"Tissue Engineering and Applied Cell Sciences\", and \"Neurosciences and Addiction Studies\". Two of the fields also accept M.Sc. students as well (\"Medical Biotechnology\" and \"Medical Nanotechnology\").\n\n==== Department of Medical Biotechnology ====\nDepartment of Medical Biotechnology was one of the three initial fields in the time of school establishment in 2008. It now accepts students in both M.Sc. and Ph.D. levels. It also accept international students based on the university policies. International students could also apply for different financial scholarships.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Apply|url=http://satim.tums.ac.ir/en/contents/view/323/admission|website=Satim.tums.ac.ir|accessdate=15 August 2018}}</ref>\nUsing different advanced biotechnology and bioinformatics techniques, academic members try to fill the gap between university and industry in medical sciences.\n\n== The university campus ==\nThe place where the anatomy hall, as the first part of the School of Medicine, was built 80 years ago was in the most northern point of the capital city of Tehran. Over the years, the capital city grew faster, and the university campus came to be located in the city center, thus becoming an active center for academic, cultural, political, and social activities of this big crowded city.\n\nThe central campus of Tehran University of Medical Sciences is the location of most of the university buildings including the School of Medicine, Pharmacy, Public Health and associated disciplines. Today, what is located at the central campus is a complex of the oldest Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry, and Public Health. In addition to the central campus, the University Headquarters is also located nearby, at the Quds-Keshavarz Intersection. Following the establishment of new schools and due to the limited physical area of the central campus, other schools were moved to different places.\n[[File:International Campus.jpg|thumb|252x252px]]\nKooy-e-Daneshgah, the main complex of students\u2019 dormitories, is located in a green-forested area not far from the central campus.

Teaching the medical sciences can have implications for cultural values and faith-based beliefs. To respect all values and beliefs, the curriculum, classroom teaching, and the student housing centers are adapted for a culturally diverse student and faculty population. Upon their graduation, students will practice medicine in every part of the world. To prepare them, the school offers an education experience and curriculum.\n\n==Rankings==\nTehran University of Medical Sciences is ranked the first among Iranian Medical Sciences Universities by Ministry of Health for seven continuous years.
