A long-time member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and an editor of the CPSU ideological journal ''Communist'' during the [[perestroika]], he joined [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s camp during [[Perestroika]]. In 1991 he quit the Communist Party{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and was promoted to Yeltsin's government.\n\nWhile in government, Gaidar advocated [[free market]] economic reforms according to the principle of [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]. His best-known decision was to abolish price regulation by the state, which immediately resulted in a major increase in prices and amounted to officially authorizing a [[market economy]] in Russia. He also cut military procurement and industrial subsidies, and reduced the budget deficit. Gaidar was the First Vice-Premier of the Russian Government and Minister of Economics from 1991 until 1992, and Minister of Finance from February 1992 until April 1992.\n\nHe was appointed Acting [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] under President [[Boris Yeltsin]] in 1992 from 15 June until 14 December, when the anti-Yeltsin Russian [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies]] refused to confirm Gaidar in this position and [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]] was eventually chosen as a compromise figure. Gaidar continued to advise the new government. On 18 September 1993, he was again appointed the First Vice-Premier under Chernomyrdin as a deliberate snub to the opposition. He played an active role in the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]].\n\nOn 3 October, he famously spoke live on Russian television, then broadcasting from an emergency station near Moscow, as there was fighting going on in the Ostankino complex, calling on Muscovites to gather to defend Yeltsin's government so that Russia would not be \"turned into an enormous concentration camp for decades\".<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqPLUz1Mlfg</ref>\n\nIn the [[1993 Russian legislative election|1993 Duma elections]], in the aftermath of the crisis, Gaidar led the pro-government bloc [[Democratic Choice of Russia|Russia's Choice]] and was seen by some as a possible future Prime Minister. However, due to the bloc's failure to win the plurality of votes in the election, Gaidar's role in the government diminished and he finally resigned on 20 January 1994.\n[[File:YegorGaidar.jpg|thumb|right|Gaidar in the early 1990s]]\nDuring the 1999 [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] Yegor Gaidar, [[Boris Nemtsov]] and [[Boris Fyodorov]] were in Belgrade, Yugoslavia on a mediation mission.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vor.ru/Kosovo/opinions_eng_29_03_99.html |title=Russia's Reaction to NATO Aggression Against Yugoslavia |date=29 March 1999 |accessdate=17 December 2009 |archivedate=28 February 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228164013/http://www.vor.ru/Kosovo/opinions_eng_29_03_99.html |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Reforms controversy===\nGaidar was often criticized for imposing ruthless reforms in 1992 with little care for their social impact; however, it has to be understood that the country back then was at the brink of a [[famine]].

Millions of Russians were thrown into poverty due to their savings being devalued by massive [[hyperinflation]]. Moreover, the [[privatization in Russia|privatization]] and break-up of state assets left over from the Soviet Union, which he played a big part in, led to much of the country's wealth being handed to a small group of powerful business executives, later known as the [[Business oligarch#Yeltsinian oligarchs|Russian oligarchs]], for much less than what they were worth. The voucher privatization program enabled these few oligarchs to become billionaires specifically by arbitraging the vast difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market. Because they stashed billions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts rather than investing in the Russian economy, these oligarchs were dubbed \"kleptocrats.\"<ref name=Granville>Johanna Granville, [https://www.academia.edu/5597850/The_Russian_Kleptocracy_and_Rise_of_Organized_Crime  \"''Dermokratizatsiya'' and ''Prikhvatizatsiya'': The Russian Kleptocracy and Rise of Organized Crime,\"]''Demokratizatsiya'' (summer 2003), pp. 448-457.</ref> As society grew to despise these figures and resent the economic and social turmoil caused by the reforms, Gaidar was often held by Russians as one of the men most responsible.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20091216/ts_nm/us_russia_gaidar_death |title=Russia's market reform architect Gaidar dies at 53|agency=[[Reuters]]|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Yavlinsky emphasized the differences between his and Gaidar's reforms program, such as the sequencing of [[privatization]] vs. [[Price controls|liberalization of prices]] and the applicability of his program to the entire Soviet Union.\n\nGaidar's supporters contend that although many mistakes were made, he had few choices in the matter and ultimately saved the country both from bankruptcy and from starvation. According to the [[BBC]]'s Andrei Ostalski, \"There were only two solutions\u2014either introduce [[Martial law in Russia|martial law]] and severe rationing, or radically liberalize the economy.

A long-time member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and an editor of the CPSU ideological journal ''Communist'' during the [[perestroika]], he joined [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s camp during [[Perestroika]]. In 1991 he quit the Communist Party{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and was promoted to Yeltsin's government.\n\nWhile in government, Gaidar advocated [[free market]] economic reforms according to the principle of [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]. His best-known decision was to abolish price regulation by the state, which immediately resulted in a major increase in prices and amounted to officially authorizing a [[market economy]] in Russia. He also cut military procurement and industrial subsidies, and reduced the budget deficit. Gaidar was the First Vice-Premier of the Russian Government and Minister of Economics from 1991 until 1992, and Minister of Finance from February 1992 until April 1992.\n\nHe was appointed Acting [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] under President [[Boris Yeltsin]] in 1992 from 15 June until 14 December, when the anti-Yeltsin Russian [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies]] refused to confirm Gaidar in this position and [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]] was eventually chosen as a compromise figure. Gaidar continued to advise the new government. On 18 September 1993, he was again appointed the First Vice-Premier under Chernomyrdin as a deliberate snub to the opposition. He played an active role in the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]].\n\nOn 3 October, he famously spoke live on Russian television, then broadcasting from an emergency station near Moscow, as there was fighting going on in the Ostankino complex, calling on Muscovites to gather to defend Yeltsin's government so that Russia would not be \"turned into an enormous concentration camp for decades\".<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqPLUz1Mlfg</ref>\n\nIn the [[1993 Russian legislative election|1993 Duma elections]], in the aftermath of the crisis, Gaidar led the pro-government bloc [[Democratic Choice of Russia|Russia's Choice]] and was seen by some as a possible future Prime Minister. However, due to the bloc's failure to win the plurality of votes in the election, Gaidar's role in the government diminished and he finally resigned on 20 January 1994.\n[[File:YegorGaidar.jpg|thumb|right|Gaidar in the early 1990s]]\nDuring the 1999 [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] Yegor Gaidar, [[Boris Nemtsov]] and [[Boris Fyodorov]] were in Belgrade, Yugoslavia on a mediation mission.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vor.ru/Kosovo/opinions_eng_29_03_99.html |title=Russia's Reaction to NATO Aggression Against Yugoslavia |date=29 March 1999 |accessdate=17 December 2009 |archivedate=28 February 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228164013/http://www.vor.ru/Kosovo/opinions_eng_29_03_99.html |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Reforms controversy===\nGaidar was often criticized for imposing ruthless reforms in 1992 with little care for their social impact; however, it has to be understood that the country back then was at the brink of a [[famine]].

Millions of Russians were thrown into poverty due to their savings being devalued by massive [[hyperinflation]]. Moreover, the [[privatization in Russia|privatization]] and break-up of state assets left over from the Soviet Union, which he played a big part in, led to much of the country's wealth being handed to a small group of powerful business executives, later known as the [[Business oligarch#Yeltsinian oligarchs|Russian oligarchs]], for much less than what they were worth. The voucher privatization program enabled these few oligarchs to become billionaires specifically by arbitraging the vast difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market. Because they stashed billions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts rather than investing in the Russian economy, these oligarchs were dubbed \"kleptocrats.\"<ref name=Granville>Johanna Granville, [https://www.academia.edu/5597850/The_Russian_Kleptocracy_and_Rise_of_Organized_Crime  \"''Dermokratizatsiya'' and ''Prikhvatizatsiya'': The Russian Kleptocracy and Rise of Organized Crime,\"]''Demokratizatsiya'' (summer 2003), pp. 448-457.</ref> As society grew to despise these figures and resent the economic and social turmoil caused by the reforms, Gaidar was often held by Russians as one of the men most responsible.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20091216/ts_nm/us_russia_gaidar_death |title=Russia's market reform architect Gaidar dies at 53|agency=[[Reuters]]|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Yavlinsky emphasized the differences between his and Gaidar's reforms program, such as the sequencing of [[privatization]] vs. [[Price controls|liberalization of prices]] and the applicability of his program to the entire Soviet Union.\n\nGaidar's supporters contend that although many mistakes were made, he had few choices in the matter and ultimately saved the country both from bankruptcy and from starvation. According to the [[BBC]]'s Andrei Ostalski, \"There were only two solutions\u2014either introduce [[Martial law in Russia|martial law]] and severe rationing, or radically liberalize the economy.

It is one of the [[Magnificent Seven cemeteries]]. Established by [[Act of Parliament]] and laid out in 1839, it opened in 1840, originally as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. Consecrated by [[Charles James Blomfield]], [[Bishop of London]] in June 1840, it is one of Britain's oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries. Some 35,000 monuments, from simple headstones to substantial mausolea, mark more than 205,000 resting places. The site includes large plots for family mausolea, and common graves where coffins are piled deep into the earth. It also has a small [[columbarium]], and a secluded Garden of Remembrance at the northern end for cremated remains. It is also known as an urban haven for nature. It was awarded a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery grant]] to carry out essential restoration and develop a visitor centre, among other improvements.\n\nIt is the only cemetery in the country to be owned by the [[Crown property|Crown]].<ref>[https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/brompton-cemetery/about-brompton-cemetery having been originally established by a private company the cemetery is now the property of the Crown</ref>\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Charles Booth 1889 map - detail showing Lillie Bridge.png|thumb|Charles Booth 1889 map \u2013 detail showing Brompton Cemetery]]\nBrompton Cemetery is adjacent to [[West Brompton station]] in west London, England. The main entrance is at North Lodge, Old Brompton Road in [[West Brompton]], [[SW postcode area|SW5]], in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]]. There is another entrance at South Lodge, located on the [[Fulham Road]], [[SW postcode area|SW10]] near the junction with [[Redcliffe Gardens]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Brompton Cemetery Chapel 09.JPG|thumb|right|Brompton Cemetery Chapel]]\n[[File:Tomb of Frederick Richards Leyland 03.JPG|thumb|Tomb of [[Frederick Richards Leyland]] (the only Grade II* funerary monument in Brompton Cemetery)]]\n[[File:The soldier's section, Brompton Cemetery.JPG|thumb|The military section, Brompton Cemetery]]\n[[File:Brompton Cemetery - geograph.org.uk - 313288.jpg|thumb|Main avenue]]\n[[File:Outer east section, Brompton Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Outer east section, Brompton Cemetery]]\n[[File:Colonnade, Brompton Cemetery, London.JPG|thumb|Colonnade, Brompton Cemetery, London]]\n[[File:Central roundel, Brompton Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Central roundel, Brompton Cemetery]]\n[[File:Brompton Cemetery, London 98.JPG|thumb|Emmeline Pankhurst's grave]]\n[[File:Brompton Cemetery, London 105.JPG|thumb|angels, Brompton Cemetery]]\n[[File:Valentine Prinsep Monument Brompton.jpg|thumb|right|Monument of [[Valentine Cameron Prinsep]]]]\n[[File:Nellie Farren Grave Brompton.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of [[Nellie Farren]]]]\n\nBy the early years of the 19th century, inner city burial grounds, mostly churchyards, had long been unable to cope with the number of burials and were seen as a hazard to health and an undignified way to treat the dead. In 1837 a decision was made to lay out a new burial ground in [[Brompton, London]]. The moving spirit behind the project was the architect and engineer, [[Stephen Geary]], and it was necessary to form a company in order to get parliamentary permission to raise capital for the purpose. Geary was appointed as architect but was later forced to resign. Securing the land \u2013 some 40 acres \u2013 from local landowner, [[William Edwardes, 2nd Baron Kensington|Lord Kensington]] and the Equitable Gas Light Company, as well as raising the money proved an extended challenge.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol41/pp246-252|title=Survey of London|last=|first=|publisher=London City Council|year=1983|isbn=|editor-last=Sheppard|editor-first=F.H.W.|volume=41|location=London|pages=246\u2013252|chapter=Brompton|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> The cemetery became one of seven large, new cemeteries founded by private companies in the mid-19th century (sometimes called the '[[Magnificent Seven cemeteries|Magnificent Seven]]') forming a ring around the edge of London.\n\nThe site, previously market gardens, having been bought with the intervention of John Gunter of [[Fulham]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/wamdocs/BromptonCemeterypp_10_15.pdf|title=Kensington and Chelsea Brompton Cemetery Conservation Area Proposals Statement.|website=Royal Borough Kensington and Chelsea|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> was {{convert|39|acre|m2}} in area. Brompton Cemetery was eventually designed by architect, Benjamin Baud with at its centre a modest domed chapel dated 1839, in the style of the [[basilica of St. Peter's]] in Rome at it southern end, reached by long colonnades, and flanked by catacombs. It was intended to give the feel of a large open air cathedral. It is rectangular in shape with the north end pointing to the northwest and the south end to the southeast. It has a central \"nave\" which runs from [[Old Brompton Road]] towards the central colonnade and chapel.\n\nBelow the colonnades are catacombs which were originally conceived as a cheaper alternative burial to having a plot in the grounds of the cemetery. Unfortunately, the catacombs were not a success and only about 500 of the many thousands of places in them were sold. The Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 gave the government powers to purchase commercial cemeteries. The shareholders of the cemetery company were relieved to be able to sell their shares as the cost of building the cemetery had overrun and they had seen little return on their investment and there were few burials at first.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] the cemetery suffered bomb damage.\n\n==Heritage status==\nThe cemetery is listed Grade I in the English Heritage [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England|Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England]] and five of the individual monuments are listed as Grade II.<ref>Leaflet entitled \"Brompton Cemetery\" issued by the Friends of Brompton Cemetery</ref><ref name=NHLE>{{NHLE|num=1000248|desc=Brompton Cemetery|access-date=10 February 2016|mode=cs2}}</ref> [[Frederick Richards Leyland]]'s is the only [[Grade II*]] listed funerary monument.\n\n==Burials==\nBrompton was closed to burials between 1952 and 1966, except for family interments, but is once again a working cemetery, with plots for interments and a 'Garden of Remembrance' for the deposit of cremated remains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brompton-cemetery.org/ |title=Brompton Cemetery |publisher=Brompton-cemetery.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref> Many nationalities and faiths from across the world are represented in the cemetery.\n\n===Military graves===\nFrom 1854 to 1939, Brompton Cemetery became the London District's Military Cemetery. The [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] purchased a plot in the north west corner where they have a monument in the form of an obelisk; the [[Brigade of the Guards]] has its own section south of that. There are 289 Commonwealth service personnel of [[World War I]] and 79 of [[World War II]], whose graves are registered and maintained by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]. A number of veterans are listed in the Notable Interments.<ref name=cwgc>{{cite web|author=r |url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/2040195/BROMPTON%20CEMETERY |title=Cemetery Details |publisher=CWGC |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref> Although the majority of war graves are in the dedicated railed section to the west \u2013 also containing 19th century services graves \u2013 a number of servicemen's graves are scattered in other areas.

Aside from the stonemason's and sculptor's craft, there is a vast array of lettering, decorative ironwork (sadly in a very corroded state) and ceramics. Some graves and mausolea are the work of noted artists and architects.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nAlthough never envisaged as a park, [[John Claudius Loudon|JC Loudon]] devised the original planting scheme that was not fully realised. There are over 60 species of trees, of which the limes are dated to 1838. The fact of the enclosure of the cemetery by a wall, has preserved almost intact, a distinct area of Victorian country flora. Each season brings its features, like snow-drops and bluebells or wild lupin, broad-leaf pea and ferns. There are small scale wooded areas and meadows. Since the land was used for [[market garden]]s, there are wild cabbages, asparagus and garlic among the slabs. In Autumn, there can be a display of [[Fungiidae|fungi]], a [[Mycology|mycologist's]] trove. The evergreens and ivy are a haven for birds and countless insects. Over 200 species of moth and butterfly have been identified in the cemetery. Mammals are represented by bats, a range of rodents, including grey squirrels and several families of foxes. Among the birds, there are many garden species with the addition of [[European green woodpecker|green woodpecker]]s and occasionally, [[kestrel]]s. The macaws are only visitors.\n\n==Public access==\nThe cemetery is open daily to the public throughout the year, with opening times varying with the seasons. It is regularly visited by the [[Parks Police Service]] to monitor and curb occurrences of anti-social behaviour.\nDog walking and cycling, under strict control, is permitted on indicated paths. Through traffic is forbidden and there is no parking. Any visiting vehicles must observe a 5&nbsp;mph limit. The [[byelaws]] are displayed on boards at both entrances.\nThe Friends of Brompton Cemetery organise Open Days, regular tours and other public attractions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brompton-cemetery.org|title=The Friends of Brompton Cemetery}}</ref>\n\nThe cemetery has a reputation for being a popular [[Cruising for sex|cruising ground]] for gay men.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://qxmagazine.com/pdf/gayhistory-west.pdf|title=Go west, young man|work=QX Magazine International|accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==A connection with Beatrix Potter==\n[[Image:Nutkins 002.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Nutkins gravestone]]\n\n[[Beatrix Potter]], who lived in Old Brompton Road nearby and enjoyed walking around it, may have taken the names of some of her characters from tombstones in the cemetery.

It is one of the [[Magnificent Seven cemeteries]]. Established by [[Act of Parliament]] and laid out in 1839, it opened in 1840, originally as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. Consecrated by [[Charles James Blomfield]], [[Bishop of London]] in June 1840, it is one of Britain's oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries. Some 35,000 monuments, from simple headstones to substantial mausolea, mark more than 205,000 resting places. The site includes large plots for family mausolea, and common graves where coffins are piled deep into the earth. It also has a small [[columbarium]], and a secluded Garden of Remembrance at the northern end for cremated remains. It is also known as an urban haven for nature.

In 1837 a decision was made to lay out a new burial ground in [[Brompton, London]]. The moving spirit behind the project was the architect and engineer, [[Stephen Geary]], and it was necessary to form a company in order to get parliamentary permission to raise capital for the purpose. Geary was appointed as architect but was later forced to resign. Securing the land \u2013 some 40 acres \u2013 from local landowner, [[William Edwardes, 2nd Baron Kensington|Lord Kensington]] and the Equitable Gas Light Company, as well as raising the money proved an extended challenge.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol41/pp246-252|title=Survey of London|last=|first=|publisher=London City Council|year=1983|isbn=|editor-last=Sheppard|editor-first=F.H.W.|volume=41|location=London|pages=246\u2013252|chapter=Brompton|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> The cemetery became one of seven large, new cemeteries founded by private companies in the mid-19th century (sometimes called the '[[Magnificent Seven cemeteries|Magnificent Seven]]') forming a ring around the edge of London.\n\nThe site, previously market gardens, having been bought with the intervention of John Gunter of [[Fulham]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/wamdocs/BromptonCemeterypp_10_15.pdf|title=Kensington and Chelsea Brompton Cemetery Conservation Area Proposals Statement.|website=Royal Borough Kensington and Chelsea|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> was {{convert|39|acre|m2}} in area. Brompton Cemetery was eventually designed by architect, Benjamin Baud with at its centre a modest domed chapel dated 1839, in the style of the [[basilica of St. Peter's]] in Rome at it southern end, reached by long colonnades, and flanked by catacombs. It was intended to give the feel of a large open air cathedral. It is rectangular in shape with the north end pointing to the northwest and the south end to the southeast. It has a central \"nave\" which runs from [[Old Brompton Road]] towards the central colonnade and chapel.\n\nBelow the colonnades are catacombs which were originally conceived as a cheaper alternative burial to having a plot in the grounds of the cemetery. Unfortunately, the catacombs were not a success and only about 500 of the many thousands of places in them were sold. The Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 gave the government powers to purchase commercial cemeteries. The shareholders of the cemetery company were relieved to be able to sell their shares as the cost of building the cemetery had overrun and they had seen little return on their investment and there were few burials at first.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] the cemetery suffered bomb damage.\n\n==Heritage status==\nThe cemetery is listed Grade I in the English Heritage [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England|Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England]] and five of the individual monuments are listed as Grade II.<ref>Leaflet entitled \"Brompton Cemetery\" issued by the Friends of Brompton Cemetery</ref><ref name=NHLE>{{NHLE|num=1000248|desc=Brompton Cemetery|access-date=10 February 2016|mode=cs2}}</ref> [[Frederick Richards Leyland]]'s is the only [[Grade II*]] listed funerary monument.\n\n==Burials==\nBrompton was closed to burials between 1952 and 1966, except for family interments, but is once again a working cemetery, with plots for interments and a 'Garden of Remembrance' for the deposit of cremated remains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brompton-cemetery.org/ |title=Brompton Cemetery |publisher=Brompton-cemetery.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref> Many nationalities and faiths from across the world are represented in the cemetery.\n\n===Military graves===\nFrom 1854 to 1939, Brompton Cemetery became the London District's Military Cemetery.

Some graves and mausolea are the work of noted artists and architects.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nAlthough never envisaged as a park, [[John Claudius Loudon|JC Loudon]] devised the original planting scheme that was not fully realised. There are over 60 species of trees, of which the limes are dated to 1838. The fact of the enclosure of the cemetery by a wall, has preserved almost intact, a distinct area of Victorian country flora. Each season brings its features, like snow-drops and bluebells or wild lupin, broad-leaf pea and ferns. There are small scale wooded areas and meadows. Since the land was used for [[market garden]]s, there are wild cabbages, asparagus and garlic among the slabs. In Autumn, there can be a display of [[Fungiidae|fungi]], a [[Mycology|mycologist's]] trove. The evergreens and ivy are a haven for birds and countless insects. Over 200 species of moth and butterfly have been identified in the cemetery. Mammals are represented by bats, a range of rodents, including grey squirrels and several families of foxes. Among the birds, there are many garden species with the addition of [[European green woodpecker|green woodpecker]]s and occasionally, [[kestrel]]s. The macaws are only visitors.\n\n==Public access==\nThe cemetery is open daily to the public throughout the year, with opening times varying with the seasons. It is regularly visited by the [[Parks Police Service]] to monitor and curb occurrences of anti-social behaviour.\nDog walking and cycling, under strict control, is permitted on indicated paths.

''Berella'' is used for milk production, and can produce 10-15 liters of milk per day per animal.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nIt has the major importance for satisfying the area's major needs for cottage industry as well as milk meat and fat. Because of the nomadic way of life the main wealth of the people are their cattle that are bred for sale, milked or shorn for their wool. Moreover, isolated as they were, they had to depend upon themselves for all their needs like food, clothing, and all the items of daily use. So all their crafts initially stemmed from necessity but later on they started exporting their goods to the other places as well. The estimated number of livestock in the desert areas is 1.6 million.\n\n===Cotton and wool products===\n[[File:Cholistan.jpg|thumb|Semipermanent Cholistani huts, known locally as ''Gopa''|alt=]]\nCholistan produces very superior type of carpet wool as compared to that produced in other parts of Pakistan. From this wool they knit beautiful carpets, rugs and other woolen items. This includes blankets, which is also a local necessity for the desert is not just a land of dust and heat, but winter nights here are very cold, usually below freezing points. Khes and pattu are also manufactured with wool or cotton. Khes is a form of blanket with a field of black white and pattu has a white ground base. Cholistanis now sell the wool for it brings maximum profit.\n\n===Textiles===\n[[File:People of Cholistan.jpg|thumb|Cholistani textiles]]\nIt may be mentioned that cotton textiles have always been a hallmark of craft of Indus valley civilization. Various kinds of khaddar-cloth are made for local consumption, and fine khaddar bedclothes and coarse lungies are woven here. A beautiful cloth called Sufi is also woven of silk and cotton, or with cotton wrap and silk wool. Gargas are made with numerous patterns and color, having complicated embroidery, mirror, and patchwork. Ajrak is another specialty of Cholistan. It is a special and delicate printing technique on both sides of the cloth in indigo blue and red patterns covering the base cloth. Cotton turbans and shawls are also made here. Chunri is another form of dopattas, having innumerable colors and patterns like dots, squares, and circles on it.\n\n== People ==\nAs per the 1998 Census of Pakistan, a total of 128,019, with a 2015 estimate of 229,071, with 70% living in Lesser Cholistan.<ref name=\":4\" /> The average household size is 6.65.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Local crafts===\nAs mentioned above, the Indus Valley has always been occupied by the wandering [[Nomad|nomadic]] tribes, who are fond of isolated areas, as such areas allow them to lead life free of foreign intrusion, enabling them to establish their own individual and unique cultures. Cholistan till the era of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] had also been isolated from outside influence. During the rule of [[Jalal-ud-Din Muhammad Akbar|Mughal Emperor Akbar]], it became a proper productive unit. The entire area was ruled by a host of kings who securely guarded their frontiers. The rulers were the great patrons of art, and the various crafts underwent a simultaneous and parallel development, influencing each other. Masons, stone carvers, artisans, artists, and designers started rebuilding the old cities and new sites, and with that flourished new courts, paintings, weaving, and pottery. The fields of architecture, sculpture, terra cotta, and pottery developed greatly in this phase.\n\n====Camel products====\nCamels are highly valued by the desert dwellers. Camels are not only useful for transportation and loading purposes, but its skin and wool are also quite worthwhile. Camel wool is spun and woven into beautiful woolen blankets known as falsies and into stylish and durable rugs. The camel's leather is also utilized in making caps, goblets, and expensive lampshades.\n\n====Leatherwork====\n[[File:C34B0273 Music in Desert.jpg|thumb|Cholistani musicians]]\nLeatherwork is another important local cottage industry due to the large number of livestock here. Other than the products mentioned above, Khusa (shoes) is a specialty of this area. Cholistani khusas are very famous for the quality of workmanship, variety, and richness of designs especially when stitched and embroidered with golden or brightly colored threads.\n\n====Jewellery ====\nThe Cholistanis are fond of jewellery, especially gold jewellery. The chief ornaments made and worn by them are ''Nath'' (nose gay), ''Katmala'' (necklace) ''Kangan'' (bracelet), and ''Pazeb'' (anklets). Gold and silver bangles are also a product of Cholistan. The locals similarly work in enamel, producing enamel buttons, earrings, bangles, and rings.\n\n==Biodiversity==\n\n=== Flora ===\nSubsoil water in Cholistan is typically brackish, and unsuitable for most plant growth.<ref name=\":1\" /> Native trees, shrubs, and grasses are drought tolerant.<ref name=\":4\" /> There area 131 plant species in Cholistan from 89 genera and 24 families.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nA man-made forest called ''Dingarh'' was developed by teh The Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR)  on more than 100 ha. Dunes were fixed and stabilized by mechanical and vegetative means, and the area is now covered with trees with orchards of ''[[Ziziphus|zizyphus]],'' [[Date palm|date palms]], and grassland grown with collected rainwater and saline groundwater.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\n===Fauna===\nThe wildlife of Cholistan desert mostly consists of migratory birds, especially [[Houbara bustard]] who migrates to this part during winters. This species of birds is most famous in the hunting season, even though they are [[endangered]] in [[Pakistan]] ([[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] globally), according to [[IUCN Red List]].

Local soil is very fine and suitable for making pottery. The fineness of the earth can be observed on the Kacha houses which are actually plastered with mud but look like they have been white washed. The chief Cholistani ceramic articles are their surahies,{{which lang|date=January 2020}} piyalas,{{which lang|date=March 2020}} and glasses, remarkable for their lightness and fine finishing.\n\nIn the early times only the art of pottery and terracotta developed, but from the seventh century onwards, a large number of temples and images were also built on account of the intensified religious passions and the accumulation of wealth in cities. The building activity reached to such an extent that some cities actually became city temples. In fact the area particularly came to be known for its forts, villas, palaces, havelis,{{which lang|date=January  gateways, fortifications, and city walls.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Mughal, M.R. 1997.

''Berella'' is used for milk production, and can produce 10-15 liters of milk per day per animal.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nIt has the major importance for satisfying the area's major needs for cottage industry as well as milk meat and fat. Because of the nomadic way of life the main wealth of the people are their cattle that are bred for sale, milked or shorn for their wool. Moreover, isolated as they were, they had to depend upon themselves for all their needs like food, clothing, and all the items of daily use. So all their crafts initially stemmed from necessity but later on they started exporting their goods to the other places as well. The estimated number of livestock in the desert areas is 1.6 million.\n\n===Cotton and wool products===\n[[File:Cholistan.jpg|thumb|Semipermanent Cholistani huts, known locally as ''Gopa''|alt=]]\nCholistan produces very superior type of carpet wool as compared to that produced in other parts of Pakistan. From this wool they knit beautiful carpets, rugs and other woolen items. This includes blankets, which is also a local necessity for the desert is not just a land of dust and heat, but winter nights here are very cold, usually below freezing points. Khes and pattu are also manufactured with wool or cotton. Khes is a form of blanket with a field of black white and pattu has a white ground base. Cholistanis now sell the wool for it brings maximum profit.\n\n===Textiles===\n[[File:People of Cholistan.jpg|thumb|Cholistani textiles]]\nIt may be mentioned that cotton textiles have always been a hallmark of craft of Indus valley civilization. Various kinds of khaddar-cloth are made for local consumption, and fine khaddar bedclothes and coarse lungies are woven here. A beautiful cloth called Sufi is also woven of silk and cotton, or with cotton wrap and silk wool. Gargas are made with numerous patterns and color, having complicated embroidery, mirror, and patchwork. Ajrak is another specialty of Cholistan. It is a special and delicate printing technique on both sides of the cloth in indigo blue and red patterns covering the base cloth. Cotton turbans and shawls are also made here. Chunri is another form of dopattas, having innumerable colors and patterns like dots, squares, and circles on it.\n\n== People ==\nAs per the 1998 Census of Pakistan, a total of 128,019, with a 2015 estimate of 229,071, with 70% living in Lesser Cholistan.<ref name=\":4\" /> The average household size is 6.65.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Local crafts===\nAs mentioned above, the Indus Valley has always been occupied by the wandering [[Nomad|nomadic]] tribes, who are fond of isolated areas, as such areas allow them to lead life free of foreign intrusion, enabling them to establish their own individual and unique cultures. Cholistan till the era of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] had also been isolated from outside influence. During the rule of [[Jalal-ud-Din Muhammad Akbar|Mughal Emperor Akbar]], it became a proper productive unit. The entire area was ruled by a host of kings who securely guarded their frontiers. The rulers were the great patrons of art, and the various crafts underwent a simultaneous and parallel development, influencing each other. Masons, stone carvers, artisans, artists, and designers started rebuilding the old cities and new sites, and with that flourished new courts, paintings, weaving, and pottery. The fields of architecture, sculpture, terra cotta, and pottery developed greatly in this phase.\n\n====Camel products====\nCamels are highly valued by the desert dwellers. Camels are not only useful for transportation and loading purposes, but its skin and wool are also quite worthwhile. Camel wool is spun and woven into beautiful woolen blankets known as falsies and into stylish and durable rugs. The camel's leather is also utilized in making caps, goblets, and expensive lampshades.\n\n====Leatherwork====\n[[File:C34B0273 Music in Desert.jpg|thumb|Cholistani musicians]]\nLeatherwork is another important local cottage industry due to the large number of livestock here. Other than the products mentioned above, Khusa (shoes) is a specialty of this area. Cholistani khusas are very famous for the quality of workmanship, variety, and richness of designs especially when stitched and embroidered with golden or brightly colored threads.\n\n====Jewellery ====\nThe Cholistanis are fond of jewellery, especially gold jewellery. The chief ornaments made and worn by them are ''Nath'' (nose gay), ''Katmala'' (necklace) ''Kangan'' (bracelet), and ''Pazeb'' (anklets). Gold and silver bangles are also a product of Cholistan. The locals similarly work in enamel, producing enamel buttons, earrings, bangles, and rings.\n\n==Biodiversity==\n\n=== Flora ===\nSubsoil water in Cholistan is typically brackish, and unsuitable for most plant growth.<ref name=\":1\" /> Native trees, shrubs, and grasses are drought tolerant.<ref name=\":4\" /> There area 131 plant species in Cholistan from 89 genera and 24 families.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nA man-made forest called ''Dingarh'' was developed by teh The Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR)  on more than 100 ha. Dunes were fixed and stabilized by mechanical and vegetative means, and the area is now covered with trees with orchards of ''[[Ziziphus|zizyphus]],'' [[Date palm|date palms]], and grassland grown with collected rainwater and saline groundwater.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\n===Fauna===\nThe wildlife of Cholistan desert mostly consists of migratory birds, especially [[Houbara bustard]] who migrates to this part during winters. This species of birds is most famous in the hunting season, even though they are [[endangered]] in [[Pakistan]] ([[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] globally), according to [[IUCN Red List]].

Local soil is very fine and suitable for making pottery. The fineness of the earth can be observed on the Kacha houses which are actually plastered with mud but look like they have been white washed. The chief Cholistani ceramic articles are their surahies,{{which lang|date=January 2020}} piyalas,{{which lang|date=March 2020}} and glasses, remarkable for their lightness and fine finishing.\n\nIn the early times only the art of pottery and terracotta developed, but from the seventh century onwards, a large number of temples and images were also built on account of the intensified religious passions and the accumulation of wealth in cities. The building activity reached to such an extent that some cities actually became city temples. In fact the area particularly came to be known for its forts, villas, palaces, havelis,{{which lang|date=January  gateways, fortifications, and city walls.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Mughal, M.R. 1997.
