Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.jccfund.org/blog/anjana-rao-retires-jcc-board-scientific-advisors/</nowiki></ref>.\n\n== Career and research ==\nMuch of Rao\u2019s early research career at Harvard was focused on [[NFAT|nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)]] transcription factors and characterizing NFATs<ref name=\":2\">Rao, A., Luo, C., & Hogan, P.G. (1997). Transcription factors of the NFAT family: regulation and function. ''Annual review of immunology'', ''15''(1), 707-747.</ref>. Her lab found NFAT proteins, expressed by most immune cells, to play a role in the transcription of genes important to an immune response<ref name=\":2\" />. They also had success in characterizing the diversity of NFAT proteins and their interactions with other transcription factors and immune proteins<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\nAlso while at Harvard, Rao contributed to the work of colleagues in research regarding the role of NFAT proteins related to activating [[Calcium release activated channel|calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels]] in immune responses<ref name=\":3\">Feske, S., Gwack, Y., Prakriya, M., Srikanth, S., Puppel, S.

Their lab found that immunodeficiency was the result of a mutation in the gene encoding CRAC channels, [[ORAI1|Orai1]]<ref name=\":3\" />. This was due to the role calcium activation plays in the translocation of the NFAT proteins to the nucleus for transcription in the genome, and therefore proper immunity<ref name=\":3\" />. \n\nSome of the more recent research Dr. Rao has been involved with at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology revolves around signaling pathways and their effect on gene expression related to immune cells and using immune cells as a model for this expression. Her lab focuses on the [[Ten-Eleven Translocation 2|ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins]] and their effect on cancer progression and cell lineage specification. TET proteins are [[demethylation]] proteins that alter gene expression by changing the methyl groups on the DNA nucleotide cysteine<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lio|first=Chan-Wang J.|last2=Yue|first2=Xiaojing|last3=L\u00f3pez-Moyado|first3=Isaac F.|last4=Tahiliani|first4=Mamta|last5=Aravind|first5=L.|last6=Rao|first6=Anjana|date=2020-01-22|title=TET methylcytosine oxidases: new insights from a decade of research|journal=Journal of Biosciences|language=en|volume=45|issue=1|pages=21|doi=10.1007/s12038-019-9973-4|issn=0973-7138}}</ref>.

She and her colleagues worked to define the term T cell exhaustion as it is a term vaguely used to mean over stimulation of T cells by antigens<ref name=\":4\" />. Further investigation with the help of many experts, help to better define the term depending on the source of antigens, either viral or tumor, and ranging from complete deficiency of function to simple loss or change in function of the T cells<ref name=\":4\" />.

(1997). Transcription factors of the NFAT family: regulation and function. ''Annual review of immunology'', ''15''(1), 707-747.</ref>. Her lab found NFAT proteins, expressed by most immune cells, to play a role in the transcription of genes important to an immune response<ref name=\":2\" />. They also had success in characterizing the diversity of NFAT proteins and their interactions with other transcription factors and immune proteins<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\nAlso while at Harvard, Rao contributed to the work of colleagues in research regarding the role of NFAT proteins related to activating [[Calcium release activated channel|calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels]] in immune responses<ref name=\":3\">Feske, S., Gwack, Y., Prakriya, M., Srikanth, S., Puppel, S. H., Tanasa, B., Hogan, P.G., Lewis, R.S., Daly, M. & Rao, A. (2006). A mutation in Orai1 causes immune deficiency by abrogating CRAC channel function. ''Nature'', ''441''(7090), 179-185.</ref>. Their lab found that immunodeficiency was the result of a mutation in the gene encoding CRAC channels, [[ORAI1|Orai1]]<ref name=\":3\" />. This was due to the role calcium activation plays in the translocation of the NFAT proteins to the nucleus for transcription in the genome, and therefore proper immunity<ref name=\":3\" />. \n\nSome of the more recent research Dr. Rao has been involved with at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology revolves around signaling pathways and their effect on gene expression related to immune cells and using immune cells as a model for this expression. Her lab focuses on the [[Ten-Eleven Translocation 2|ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins]] and their effect on cancer progression and cell lineage specification. TET proteins are [[demethylation]] proteins that alter gene expression by changing the methyl groups on the DNA nucleotide cysteine<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lio|first=Chan-Wang J.|last2=Yue|first2=Xiaojing|last3=L\u00f3pez-Moyado|first3=Isaac F.|last4=Tahiliani|first4=Mamta|last5=Aravind|first5=L.|last6=Rao|first6=Anjana|date=2020-01-22|title=TET methylcytosine oxidases: new insights from a decade of research|journal=Journal of Biosciences|language=en|volume=45|issue=1|pages=21|doi=10.1007/s12038-019-9973-4|issn=0973-7138}}</ref>.

They colonized much of the world for Spain and Portugal in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.\n\nAfter the [[Spain|Spanish]] discovery of the [[West Indies]] in 1492, the Spanish, primarily nobles from the west and south of Spain, began building up an American empire in the Caribbean, using islands such as [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Hispaniola]] as bases. From 1519 to 1521, [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] waged a [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|campaign]] against the [[Aztec Empire]], ruled by [[Moctezuma II]]. From the territories of the Aztec Empire conquistadors expanded Spanish rule to northern Central America and parts of what is now southern and western United States and from Mexico sailing the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the [[Philippines]]. Other conquistadors took over the [[Inca Empire]] after crossing the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and sailing the Pacific to northern [[Peru]]. As [[Francisco Pizarro]] [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|subdued the empire]] in a manner similar to Cort\u00e9s other conquistadores used Peru as base for conquering much of [[Ecuador]] and [[Chile]]. In [[Colombia]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Argentina]] conquistadors from Peru linked up with other conquistadors arriving more directly from the Caribbean and [[R\u00edo de la Plata]]-[[Paraguay]] respectively. All this conquests founded the basis for modern [[Hispanic America]] and the [[Hispanophone]]. \n\nBesides conquests, Spanish conquistadors made significant explorations into the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon Jungle]], [[Patagonia]], the interior of North America, and the discovery and exploration of the Pacific Ocean. Conquistadors founded numerous cities, many of them on locations with pre-existing pre-colonial settlements including [[Manila]] and the capitals of most Latin American countries. \n\nConquistadors in the service of the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese Crown]] led numerous conquests for the Portuguese Empire, across [[South America]] and [[Africa]], as well as commercial colonies in Asia, founding the origins of modern [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries|Portuguese-speaking world]] in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Notable Portuguese conquistadors include [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] who led conquests across [[India]], the [[Persian Gulf]], the East Indies, and [[East Africa]], and [[Filipe de Brito e Nicote]] who led conquests into [[Burma]] and was made King of [[Bago Region|Pegu]].\n\n==Conquest==\n[[File:La Rendici\u00f3n de Granada - Pradilla.jpg|thumb|The surrender of [[Granada]] in 1492.

Their units (''compa\u00f1ia'') would often specialize in forms of combat that required long periods of training that were too costly for informal groups. Their armies were mostly composed of Iberian and other European soldiers.\n\nNative allied troops were largely infantry equipped with armament and armour that varied geographically. Some groups consisted of young men without military experience, [[Catholic clergy]] which helped with administrative duties, and soldiers with military training. These native forces often included African slaves and Native Americans. They not only fought in the battlefield but served as interpreters, informants, servants, teachers, physicians, and scribes. [[India Catalina]] and [[La Malinche|Malintzin]] were Native American women slaves who worked for the Spaniards.\n\nCastilian law prohibited foreigners and non-Catholics from settling in the New World. However, not all conquistadors were Castilian. Many foreigners Hispanicised their names and/or converted to Catholicism to serve the Castilian Crown. For example, [[Juan de Fuca|Io\u00e1nnis Fok\u00e1s]] (known as Juan de Fuca) was a Castilian of Greek origin who discovered the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca|strait that bears his name]] between [[Vancouver Island]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] in 1592. German-born [[Nikolaus Federmann]], Hispanicised as Nicol\u00e1s de Federm\u00e1n, was a ''conquistador'' in Venezuela and Colombia. The Venetian [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastiano Caboto]] was Sebasti\u00e1n Caboto, [[Georg von Speyer]] Hispanicised as Jorge de la Espira, Eusebio Francesco Chini Hispanicised as [[Eusebio Kino]], [[Wenceslaus Linck]] was Wenceslao Linck, [[Ferdinand Kon\u0161\u010dak]], was Fernando Consag, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] was Am\u00e9rico Vespucio, and the Portuguese [[Aleixo Garcia]] was known as Alejo Garc\u00eda in the Castilian army.\n\nThe origin of many people in mixed expeditions was not always distinguished. Various occupations, such as sailors, fishermen, soldiers and nobles employed different languages (even from unrelated language groups), so that crew and settlers of Iberian empires recorded as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicians]] from Spain were actually using Portuguese, Basque, Catalan, Italian and [[Occitan|Languedoc]] languages, which were wrongly identified.\n\nCastilian law banned Spanish women from travelling to America unless they were married and accompanied by a husband. Women who travelled thus include Mar\u00eda de Escobar, [[Mar\u00eda Estrada]], Marina V\u00e9lez de Ortega, Marina de la Caballer\u00eda, Francisca de Valenzuela, Catalina de Salazar. Some conquistadors married Native American women or had illegitimate children.\n[[File:ROHM D195 The conquistadors pray before entry to tenochtitlan.jpg|upright|thumb|Conquistadors praying before a battle at [[Tenochtitlan]]]]\nEuropean young men enlisted in the army because it was one way out of poverty. Catholic priests instructed the soldiers in mathematics, writing, theology, Latin, Greek, and history, and wrote letters and official documents for them. King's army officers taught military arts. An uneducated young recruit could become a military leader, elected by their fellow professional soldiers, perhaps based on merit. Others were born into [[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgo]] families, and as such they were members of the Spanish [[nobility]] with some studies but without economic resources. Even some rich nobility families' members became soldiers or missionaries, but mostly not the firstborn heirs.\n\nThe two most famous conquistadors were [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] who conquered the [[Aztec Empire]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] who led the conquest of the [[Incan Empire]]. They were second cousins born in [[Extremadura]], where many of the Spanish conquerors were born.\nCatholic religious orders that participated and supported the exploration, evangelizing and pacifying, were mostly [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Carmelites]], [[Franciscan Order|Franciscans]] and [[Jesuit Order|Jesuits]], for example [[Francis Xavier]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]], [[Eusebio Kino]], [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]] or [[Gaspar da Cruz]]. In 1536, Dominican friar Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas went to [[Oaxaca]] to participate in a series of discussions and debates among the Bishops of the Dominican and Franciscan orders. The two orders had very different approaches to the conversion of the Indians. The Franciscans used a method of mass conversion, sometimes baptizing many thousands of Indians in a day. This method was championed by prominent Franciscans such as [[Toribio de Benavente]].\n\nThe conquistadors took many different roles, including religious leader, [[harem]] keeper, King or Emperor, deserter and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] warrior. ''[[Caramuru]]'' was a Portuguese settler in the [[Tupi people|Tupinamb\u00e1]] Indians. [[Gonzalo Guerrero]] was a Mayan war leader for Nachan can, Lord of [[Chactemal]]. [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]], who had taken holy orders in his native Spain was captured by Mayan lords too, and later was a soldier with Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. Francisco Pizarro had children with more than 40 women. The [[chronicler]]s [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]], [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo]], [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]], [[Juan de Castellanos]] and friar [[Pedro Sim\u00f3n]] wrote about the Americas.\n[[File:Atawallpa Pizarro tinkuy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francisco Pizarro]] meets with the Inca emperor [[Atahualpa]], 1532]]\n\nAfter Mexico fell, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's enemies, [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], [[Diego Columbus]] and [[Francisco Garay]]<ref>p30-31 of J.H.

After present-day Peruvian territories fell to Spain, [[Francisco Pizarro]] dispatched ''El Adelantado'', [[Diego de Almagro]], before they became enemies to the Inca Empire's northern city of [[Quito]] to claim it. Their fellow conquistador [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]], who had gone forth without Pizarro's approval, had already reached Quito. The arrival of [[Pedro de Alvarado]] from the lands known today as [[Mexico]] in search of Inca gold further complicated the situation for De Almagro and Belalc\u00e1zar. De Alvarado left South America in exchange for monetary compensation from Pizarro. De Almagro was executed in 1538, by [[Hernando Pizarro]]'s orders. In 1541 Lima, supporters of [[Diego Almagro II]] assassinated Francisco Pizarro. In 1546, De Belalc\u00e1zar ordered the execution of [[Jorge Robledo (conquistador)|Jorge Robledo]], who governed a neighbouring province in yet another land-related vendetta. De Belalc\u00e1zar was tried in absentia, convicted and condemned for killing Robledo and other offenses pertaining to his involvement in the wars between armies of conquistadors. [[Pedro de Urs\u00faa]] was killed by his subordinate [[Lope de Aguirre]] who crowned himself king while searching for ''[[El Dorado]]''. In 1544, Lope de Aguirre and [[Melchor Verdugo]] (a ''[[converso]]'' Jew) were at the side of Peru's first viceroy Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, who had arrived from Spain with orders to implement the [[New Laws]] and suppress the [[encomienda]]s. [[Gonzalo Pizarro]], [[Pizarro brothers|another brother]] of Francisco Pizarro, rose in revolt, killed viceroy [[Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela]] and most of his Spanish army in the battle in 1546, and Gonzalo attempted to have himself crowned king.\n\nThe Emperor commissioned bishop [[Pedro de la Gasca]] to restore the peace, naming him president of the ''[[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]]'' and providing him with unlimited authority to punish and pardon the rebels. Gasca repealed the [[New Laws]], the issue around which the rebellion had been organized. Gasca convinced [[Pedro de Valdivia]], explorer of Chile, [[Alonso de Alvarado]] another searcher for ''El Dorado'', and others that if he were unsuccessful, a royal fleet of 40 ships and 15,000 men was preparing to sail from [[Seville]] in June.{{clarify|what year??|date=June 2012}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Portrait of Francisco Pizarro.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Francisco Pizarro]]\n\n===Early Portuguese period===\n[[File:Cortez & La Malinche.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and his counsellor, the Indian woman [[La Malinche]] meet [[Moctezuma II]] in [[Tenochtitlan]], 8 November 1519.

In 1415, Portugal conquered [[Ceuta]], its first overseas colony.\n\nThroughout the 15th century, [[European exploration of Africa#Portuguese explorers|Portuguese explorers]] sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for [[Economic history of Portugal#15th century|tradable commodities]] such as firearms, spices, silver, gold, and [[slavery|slaves]] crossing Africa and India. In 1434 the first consignment of [[slaves]] was brought to [[Lisbon]]; slave trading was the most profitable branch of Portuguese commerce until the Indian subcontinent was reached.\n\n===Birth of the Spanish Kingdom===\nAfter his father's death in 1479, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II of Arag\u00f3n]] unified Castile with Arag\u00f3n, creating the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. He later tried to incorporate by marriage the kingdom of Portugal. Ferdinand notably supported Columbus's first voyage that launched the conquistadors into action.\n\n===Treaties===\nThe 1492 discovery of the [[New World]] by Spain rendered desirable a [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of the Spanish and Portuguese spheres of exploration. Thus dividing the world into two exploration and colonizing areas seemed appropriate. This was accomplished by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] (7 June 1494) which modified the delimitation authorized by [[Pope Alexander VI]] in two [[papal bull|bulls]] issued on 4 May 1493. The treaty gave to Portugal all lands which might be discovered east of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] drawn from the [[Arctic]] Pole to the [[Antarctic]], at a distance of {{convert|370|league}} west of [[Cape Verde]]. Spain received the lands west of this line.\n\nThe known means of measuring [[longitude]] were so inexact that the line of demarcation could not in practice be determined,<ref>J. de Andrade Corvo in ''Journal das Ci\u00eancias Matem\u00e1ticas'', xxxi.147\u2013176, Lisbon, 1881</ref> subjecting the treaty to diverse interpretations.

In the struggle between Holland and Portugal for the possession of Brazil the Dutch were supported by the Jews.\n\nFrom 1630 to 1654, the Dutch set up more permanently in the ''Nordeste'' and controlled a long stretch of the coast most accessible to Europe, without, however, penetrating the interior. But the colonists of the [[Dutch West India Company]] in Brazil were in a constant state of siege, in spite of the presence in Recife of [[John Maurice of Nassau]] as governor. After several years of open warfare, the Dutch formally withdrew in 1661.\n\nPortuguese sent military expeditions to the [[Amazon Rainforest]] and conquered British and Dutch strongholds,<ref>[http://www.s4ulanguages.com/wic.html Facsimiles of multiple original documents] relating about the events in Brazil in the 17th century that led to a Dutch influence and their final defeat</ref> founding villages and forts from 1669.<ref>Calmon, p.&nbsp;294.</ref> In 1680 they reached the far south and founded [[Colonia del Sacramento|Sacramento]] on the bank of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata|Rio de la Plata]], in the Eastern Strip region (present-day [[Uruguay]]).<ref>Bueno, p.&nbsp;86.</ref>\n\nIn the 1690s, gold was discovered by [[Bandeirantes|explorers]] in the region that would later be called [[Minas Gerais]] (General Mines) in current [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Goi\u00e1s]].\n\nBefore the Iberian Union period (1580\u20131640), Spain tried to prevent Portuguese expansion into Brazil with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|1494 Treaty of Tordesillas]].

Portugal had landed in North Africa after [[Abu Abdallah Mohammed II Saadi|Abu Abdallah]] asked him to help recover the Saadian throne. Abu Abdallah's uncle, Abd Al-Malik, had taken it from Abu Abdallah with Ottoman Empire support. The defeat of Abu Abdallah and the death of Portugal's king led to the end of the Portuguese [[House of Aviz|Aviz dynasty]] and later to the integration of Portugal and its empire at the [[Iberian Union]] for 60 years under Sebastian's uncle [[Philippine Dynasty|Philip II of Spain]].

The [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|English-Spanish wars of 1585\u20131604]] were clashes not only in English and Spanish ports or on the sea between them but also in and around the present-day territories of Florida, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Panama. War with the Dutch led to invasions of many countries in Asia, including Ceylon and commercial interests in Japan, Africa ([[History of Gabon|Mina]]), and South America. Even though the Portuguese were unable to capture the entire island of Ceylon, they were able to control its coastal regions for a considerable time.\n\nFrom 1580 to 1670 mostly, the [[Bandeirantes]] in Brazil focused on slave hunting, then from 1670 to 1750 they focused on mineral wealth. Through these expeditions and the [[Dutch\u2013Portuguese War]], [[Colonial Brazil]] expanded from the small limits of the [[Tordesilhas Line]] to roughly the same borders as current Brazil.\n\n[[File:Spanish Empire Anachronous 0.PNG|thumb|upright=1.75|The combined Spanish and Portuguese empires during the [[Iberian Union]] (1580\u20131640)]]\nIn the 17th century, taking advantage of this period of Portuguese weakness, the Dutch occupied many Portuguese territories in Brazil. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]] was appointed as the governor of the Dutch possessions in Brazil in 1637 by the [[Dutch West India Company]]. He landed at Recife, the port of Pernambuco, in January 1637. In a series of expeditions, he gradually expanded from Sergipe on the south to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds de Maranh\u00e3o in the north. He likewise conquered the Portuguese possessions of [[Elmina Castle]], Saint Thomas, and [[Luanda]] and Angola. The Dutch intrusion into Brazil was long lasting and troublesome to Portugal. The [[Seventeen Provinces]] captured a large portion of the Brazilian coast including the provinces of [[Bahia]], Pernambuco, [[Para\u00edba]], Rio Grande do Norte, [[Cear\u00e1]], and [[Sergipe]], while Dutch privateers sacked Portuguese ships in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The large area of Bahia and its city, the strategically important Salvador, was recovered quickly by an Iberian military expedition in 1625.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal re-established authority over its lost territories including remaining Dutch controlled areas. The other smaller, less developed areas were recovered in stages and relieved of Dutch piracy in the next two decades by local resistance and Portuguese expeditions.\n\n[[Spanish Formosa]] was established in Taiwan, first by Portugal in 1544 and later renamed and repositioned by Spain in [[Keelung]]. It became a natural defence site for the Iberian Union. The colony was designed to protect Spanish and Portuguese trade from interference by the Dutch base in the south of Taiwan. The Spanish colony was short-lived due to the unwillingness of Spanish colonial authorities in [[Manila]] to defend it.\n\n==Disease in the Americas==\n[[File:Florentinoviruela.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Aztecs dying of smallpox, (\"[[Florentine Codex|The Florentine Codex]]\" 1540\u201385)]]\nWhile technological superiority, cultural factors and local allies played an important role in the victories of the conquistadors in the Americas, their conquest was greatly facilitated by old world diseases: [[smallpox]], [[chicken pox]], [[diphtheria]], [[typhus]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]].

They found other [[precious metals]] such as silver, which was particularly abundant in [[Potos\u00ed]], in modern-day Bolivia. They discovered new routes, [[ocean current]]s, [[trade winds]], crops, spices and other products. In the sail era knowledge of winds and currents was essential, for example, the [[Agulhas current]] long prevented Portuguese sailors from reaching India. Various places in Africa and the Americas have been named after the imagined cities made of gold, rivers of gold and precious stones.\n\nShipwrecked off [[Santa Catarina (island)|Santa Catarina island]] in present-day Brazil, [[Aleixo Garcia]] living among the Guaran\u00eds heard tales of a \"White King\" who lived to the west, ruling cities of incomparable riches and splendour.

As a consequence, many documents that could reach other European countries included fake dates and faked facts, to mislead any other nation's possible efforts. For example, the [[Island of California]] refers to a famous [[cartography|cartographic]] error propagated on many maps during the 17th and 18th centuries, despite contradictory evidence from various explorers. The legend was initially infused with the idea that California was a terrestrial paradise, peopled by black women [[Amazons]].\n\nThe tendency to secrecy and falsification of dates casts doubts about the authenticity of many [[primary sources]]. Several historians have hypothesized that John II may have known of the existence of Brazil and North America as early as 1480, thus explaining his wish in 1494 at the signing of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], to push the line of influence further west.

He established direct royal control with the [[Council of the Indies]], the most important administrative organ of the [[Spanish Empire]], both in the Americas and in Asia. After unifying Castile, Ferdinand introduced to Castile many laws, regulations and institutions such as the [[Inquisition]], that were typical in Aragon. These laws were later used in the new lands.\n\nThe [[Laws of Burgos]], created in 1512\u20131513, were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of settlers in Spanish colonial America, particularly with regards to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. They forbade the maltreatment of indigenous people, and endorsed their conversion to Catholicism.\n\nThe evolving structure of colonial government was not fully formed until the third quarter of the 16th century; however, ''[[Catholic Monarchs|los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos]]'' designated [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca]] to study the problems related to the colonization process. Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca effectively became minister for the Indies and laid the foundations for the creation of a colonial bureaucracy, combining legislative, executive and judicial functions. Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca presided over the council, which contained a number of members of the [[Council of Castile]] (''Consejo de Castilla''), and formed a ''Junta de Indias'' of about eight counsellors. Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was already using the term \"[[Council of the Indies]]\" in 1519.\n[[File:Portrait of Philip II of Spain by Sofonisba Anguissola - 002b.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Philip II of Spain]] (1527\u20131598).]]\n\nThe Crown reserved for itself important tools of intervention. The \"capitulacion\" clearly stated that the conquered territories belonged to the Crown, not to the individual. On the other hand, ''concessions'' allowed the Crown to guide the Companies conquests to certain territories, depending on their interests. In addition, the leader of the expedition received clear instructions about their duties towards the army, the native population, the type of military action. A written report about the results was mandatory. The army had a royal official, the \"veedor\". The \"veedor\" or notary, ensured they complied with orders and instructions and preserved the King's share of the booty.\n\nIn practice the Capit\u00e1n had almost unlimited power. Besides the Crown and the conquistador, they were very important the backers who were charged with anticipating the money to the Capit\u00e1n and guarantee payment of obligations.\n\nArmed groups sought supplies and funds in various ways. Financing was requested from the King, delegates of the Crown, the nobility, rich merchants or the troops themselves. The more professional campaigns were funded by the Crown. Campaigns were sometimes initiated by inexperienced governors, because in [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Colonial America]], offices were bought or handed to relatives or cronies. Sometimes, an expedition of conquistadors were a group of influential men who had recruited and equipped their fighters, by promising a share of the booty.\n\nThe conquistador borrowed as little as possible, preferring to invest all their belongings. Sometimes, every soldier brought his own equipment and supplies, other times the soldiers received gear as an advance from the conquistador.\n\nThe [[Pinz\u00f3n brothers]], seamen of the [[R\u00edo Tinto (river)|Tinto]]\u2013[[Odiel]] participated in Columbus's undertaking.<ref name = \"ortegamartin\">{{Harvnb|Ortega|1980|loc=Tomo III, p. 37-110}}</ref> They also supported the project economically, supplying money from their personal fortunes.<ref name = \"LascasasPinz\u00f3n\">{{cite book |last= de las Casas|first= Bartolom\u00e9|authorlink= Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas|title= Historia de las Indias| url = http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12033856617830495876213/index.htm|accessdate= 18 October 2008|chapter= Tomo I.

The contribution of each individual conditioned the subsequent division of the booty, receiving a portion the pawn (lancero, piquero, alabardero, rodelero) and twice a man on horseback (caballero) owner of a horse.{{clarify|date=March 2013}} Sometimes part of the booty consisted of women and/or slaves. Even the dogs, important weapons of war in their own right, were in some cases rewarded. The division of the booty produced conflicts, such as the one between Pizarro and Almagro.\n\n==Military advantages==\n[[File:Mendoza, Villagra y Quiroga segun Ovalle.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alonso de Ovalle]]'s 1646 engraving of the conquistadors [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Pedro de Villagra]] and [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]]]] \n[[File:Cabeza reducida J\u00edbaro (M.

In 1599, the Jivaro destroyed Spanish settlements in eastern Ecuador and killed all the men.]]\n\nConquistadors had overwhelming military advantages over the native peoples. They belonged to a more militarily advanced civilization with better techniques, tools, firearms, artillery, iron, steel and domesticated animals. Horses and mules carried them, pigs fed them and dogs fought for them. The indigenous peoples had the advantage of established settlements, determination to remain independent and large numerical superiority. European diseases and [[divide and rule|divide and conquer]] tactics contributed to the defeat of the native populations.\n[[File:Los 13 de la Isla del Gallo.jpg|thumb|left|A group of 16th century conquistadors that participated in the Spanish conquest of Peru (second expedition) along with their leader, [[Francisco Pizarro]].]]\nIn the Iberian peninsula, in a situation of constant conflict, warfare and daily life were strongly interlinked. Small, lightly equipped armies were maintained at all times. The state of war continued intermittently for centuries and created a very warlike culture in Iberia.\n\n===Strategy===\nAnother factor was the ability of the conquistadors to manipulate the political situation between indigenous peoples. To beat the [[Inca]] civilization, they supported one side of a civil war. They overthrew the [[Aztec]] civilization by allying with natives who had been subjugated by more powerful neighbouring tribes and kingdoms. These tactics had been used since antiquity, for example, in the [[Granada War]], the [[conquest of the Canary Islands]] and [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|conquest of Navarre]]. Throughout the conquest, the indigenous people greatly outnumbered the conquistadors; the conquistador troops never exceeded 2% of the native population. The army with which [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] besieged [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|Tenochtitlan]] was composed of 200,000 soldiers, of which fewer than 1% were Spaniards.<ref name=Mann/>{{rp|178}}\n\nThe Europeans practiced war within the terms and laws of their concept of a ''[[just war]]''. While Spanish soldiers went to the battlefield to kill their enemies, the Aztecs and [[Maya peoples|Mayas]] captured their enemies for use as sacrificial victims to their gods\u2014a process called \"[[flower war]]\" by Spanish historians.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn traditional cultures of the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], and [[hunter-gatherer]] societies the warfare was mostly 'endemic', long duration, low intensity, usually evolving into almost a ritualized form. By contrast, Europe had moved to 'sporadic' warfare in the Middle Ages due to the availability of professionally mercenary armies.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} When Italy was ransacked by French and Spanish Armies in the early 1500s, most Italian states were easily defeated by armies practicing sporadic-warfare. Aztec and other native peoples practiced an endemic system of warfare as well, and so were easily defeated by Spanish and Portuguese sporadic-warfare armies in the early 1500s.\n\n===Tactics===\nThese forces were capable of quickly moving long distances, allowing a quick return home after battle. Wars were mainly between clans, expelling intruders. On land, these wars combined some European methods with techniques from Muslim bandits in [[Al-Andalus]]. These tactics consisted of small groups who attempted to catch their opponents by surprise, through an ambush.\n\nIn [[Mombasa]], [[Vasco da Gama|Dom Vasco da Gama]] resorted to [[piracy]], looting Arab merchant ships, which were generally unarmed trading vessels without heavy cannons.\n\n===Equipment and animals===\n\n====Firearms and crossbows====\nEuropean conquistadors in the Americas made extensive use of [[crossbow]]s, with firearms becoming widespread only from the 1570s.<ref name=Espino2012>{{cite journal |last1=Espino L\u00f3pez |first1=Antonio |date=2012 |title=El uso t\u00e1ctico de las armas de fuego en las guerras civiles peruanas (1538-1547) |journal=Historica|language=Spanish |volume=XXXVI |issue=2 |pages=7\u201348 |access-date= }}</ref> A scarcity of firearms did not prevent conquistadors to pioneer the use mounted arquebusiers, an early form of [[dragoon]].<ref name=Espino2012/> In the 1540s [[Francisco de Carvajal]]'s use of firearms in the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|Spanish civil war in Peru]] prefigured the [[volley fire]] technique that developed in Europe many decades after.<ref name=Espino2012/>\n\n====Animals====\n[[File:1898 urtoko pottoka eta artzanora.jpg|thumb|left|Basque Countrymen near the France\u2013Spain border in 1898, with characteristic horse, donkey and dogs. These were the type of animals introduced to America.]]\n[[File:Mastspagn3.jpg|thumb|Spanish Mastiff used in expeditions and guard]] \nAnimals were another important factor for Spanish triumph. On the one hand, the introduction of the horse and other domesticated pack animals allowed them greater mobility unknown to the Indian cultures. However, in the mountains and jungles, the Spaniards were less able to use narrow Amerindian roads and bridges made for pedestrian traffic, which were sometimes no wider than a few feet. In places such as [[History of Argentina#Spanish colonial era|Argentina]], [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|New Mexico]] and [[History of California to 1899#Spanish colonization and governance (1697\u20131821)|California]], the indigenous people learned horsemanship, cattle raising, and sheep herding. The use of the new techniques by indigenous groups later became a disputed factor in native resistance to the colonial and American governments.\n\nThe Spaniards were also skilled at breeding dogs for war, hunting and protection. The [[Molosser]]s, [[Alano Espa\u00f1ol|Spanish war dogs]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Derr | first = Mark | title = A Dog's History of America | publisher = North Point Press | year = 2004 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/dogshistoryofame00mark/page/23 23\u201345] | isbn = 978-0-86547-631-8 | lay-url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57784-2004Sep2.html | url = https://archive.org/details/dogshistoryofame00mark/page/23 }}</ref> and [[Livestock guardian dog|sheep dogs]] they used in battle were effective as a psychological weapon against the natives, who, in many cases, had never seen domesticated dogs. Although some indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere did have domestic dogs, including the current Southwestern US, Aztec and other Central American peoples, the inhabitants of the Arctic/Tundra regions (Inuit, Aleut, Cree), and possibly some South American groups similar to South American fox (''[[Pseudalopex culpaeus]]'') or Yagan dog,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theobligatescientist.blogspot.com/2010/07/monday-mammal-10-yagan-dog.html|title=Monday Mammal #10: Yag\u00e1n \"dog\"|last=Paul|website=TheObligateScientist.Blogspot.com|access-date=30 May 2017}}</ref> during the conquest of the Americas, Spanish conquistadors used [[Spanish Mastiff]]s and other [[Molossers]] in battle against the [[Ta\u00ednos]], [[Aztecs]] and [[Mayans]]. These specially trained dogs were feared because of their strength and ferocity. The strongest big breeds of broad-mouthed dogs were [[Attack dog|specifically trained]] for battle. These [[Dogs in warfare|war dogs]] were used against barely clothed troops. They were armoured dogs trained to kill and disembowel.<ref name=Stannard>{{cite book|title=American holocaust: the conquest of the New World|first=David |last=Stannard}}</ref>\n\nThe most famous of these dogs of war was a mascot of [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n|Ponce de Leon]] called ''Becerrillo'', the first European dog known to reach North America;{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} another famous dog called ''Leoncico'', the son of ''Becerillo'', and the first European dog known to see the Pacific Ocean, was a mascot of [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] and accompanied him on several expeditions.\n\n==Nautical science==\n[[File:AlmanachPerpetuum.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ephemeris]] by [[Abraham Zacuto]] in Almanach Perpetuum, 1496]]\n\nThe successive expeditions and experience of the Portuguese pilots led to a rapid evolution of Portuguese nautical science.\n\n===Navigation===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\nIn the thirteenth century they were guided by the sun position. For [[celestial navigation]] like other Europeans, they used Greek tools, like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], which they made easier and simpler. They also created the [[cross-staff]], or ''cane of Jacob'', for measuring at sea the height of the sun and other stars. The [[Southern Cross]] became a reference upon the arrival of [[Jo\u00e3o de Santar\u00e9m]] and [[Pedro Escobar]] in the Southern hemisphere in 1471, starting its use in celestial navigation. The results varied throughout the year, which required corrections. To address this the Portuguese used the astronomical tables ([[Ephemeris]]), a precious tool for oceanic navigation, which spread widely in the fifteenth century. These tables revolutionized navigation, enabling [[latitude]] calculations. The tables of the [[Almanach Perpetuum]], by astronomer [[Abraham Zacuto]], published in Leiria in 1496, were used along with its improved astrolabe, by [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]].\n\n===Ship design===\n{{Main|Iberian ship development, 1400\u20131600}}\n[[File:Caravel Boa Esperanca Portugal.jpg|thumb|left|A Portuguese [[caravel]]]]\nThe ship that truly launched the first phase of the discoveries along the African coast was the Portuguese [[caravel]]. Iberians quickly adopted it for their merchant navy. It was a development based on African fishing boats. They were agile and easier to navigate, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and one to three masts, with [[lateen]] triangular sails allowing [[luffing]]. The caravel particularly benefited from a greater capacity to [[tack (sailing)|tack]]. The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks, but have not hindered its success. Limited crew and cargo space was acceptable, initially, because as exploratory ships, their \"cargo\" was what was in the explorer's discoveries about a new territory, which only took up the space of one person.<ref>[[Roger Smith (journalist)|Roger Smith]], \"Vanguard of the Empire\", Oxford University Press, 1993, p.30</ref> Among the famous caravels are ''Berrio'' and ''Caravela Annunciation''. Columbus also used them in his travels.\n\nLong oceanic voyages led to larger ships. \"Nau\" was the Portuguese archaic synonym for any large ship, primarily [[merchant ship]]s. Due to the piracy that plagued the coasts, they began to be used in the navy and were provided with cannon windows, which led to the classification of \"naus\" according to the power of its artillery. The [[carrack]] or nau was a three- or four-[[Mast (sailing)|masted]] ship. It had a high rounded [[stern]] with large [[aftcastle]], [[forecastle]] and [[bowsprit]] at the stem. It was first used by the Portuguese, and later by the Spanish. They were also adapted to the increasing maritime trade. They grew from 200 tons capacity in the 15th century to 500. In the 16th century they usually had two [[deck (ship)|decks]], stern castles fore and aft, two to four masts with overlapping sails. In India travels in the sixteenth century used carracks, large merchant ships with a high edge and three masts with square sails, that reached 2,000 tons.\n\n===Winds and currents===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|Map of the five major [[oceanic gyre]]s]]\nBesides coastal exploration, Portuguese ships also made trips further out to gather [[meteorological]] and [[oceanographic]] information. These voyages revealed the archipelagos of [[Bissagos Islands]] where the Portuguese were defeated by native people in 1535, Madeira, the Azores, Cape Verde, Sao Tome, [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]], [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Corisco]], [[Elobey Grande]], [[Elobey Chico]] [[Annobon Island]], [[Ascension Island]], [[Bioko Island]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Principe Island]], [[Saint Helena|Saint Helena Island]], [[Tristan da Cunha]] Island and [[Sargasso Sea]].\n\nThe knowledge of wind patterns and [[ocean current|currents]], the [[trade winds]] and the [[oceanic gyre]]s in the Atlantic, and the determination of latitude led to the discovery of the best ocean route back from Africa: crossing the Central Atlantic to the Azores, using the winds and currents that spin clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere because of [[atmospheric circulation]] and the effect of [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis]], facilitating the way to Lisbon and thus enabling the Portuguese to venture farther from shore, a manoeuvre that became known as the ''\"volta do mar\"'' (''return of the sea''). In 1565, the application of this principle in the Pacific Ocean led the Spanish discovering the [[Manila Galleon]] trade route.\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Map of Angelino Dulcert cropped.jpg|thumb| Portolan of [[Angelino Dulcert]] (1339) showing [[Lanzarote]] island]]\n\nIn 1339 [[Angelino Dulcert]] of Majorca produced the [[portolan chart]] map.

[[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]], in his ''Decadas de Asia'' (1552: I.16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA133 p. 133]) adds that he was also a master instrument-maker.</ref> 'Jacome of Majorca' is even sometimes described as the head of Henry's observatory and \"school\" at [[Sagres (Vila do Bispo)|Sagres]].<ref>\"He also from Majorca caused one Master James, a man skilfull (sic) in Navigation and in Cards and Sea Instruments, to be brought into Portugall, there at his charge as it were, to erect a Schoole of Marinership, and to instruct his Countreymen in that Mysterie.\"\n[[Samuel Purchas]], ''Hakluytus Posthumus'', (1625, vol. 2, pt.2 [https://archive.org/details/hakluytusposthu92purcgoog/page/n103 p.11])</ref>\n[[File:Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-mercator navigation chart of the Coast of Africa (1571), by [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] ([[Torre do Tombo National Archive|Torre do Tombo]], [[Lisbon]])]]\n\nIt is thought that [[Jehuda Cresques]], son of Jewish cartographer Abraham Cresques of [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] in Majorca, and Italian-Majorcan [[Angelino Dulcert]] were cartographers at the service of Prince Henry. Majorca had many skilled Jewish cartographers. However, the oldest signed Portuguese sea chart is a Portolan made by [[Pedro Reinel]] in 1485 representing the Western Europe and parts of Africa, reflecting the explorations made by [[Diogo C\u00e3o]]. Reinel was also author of the first nautical chart known with an indication of latitudes in 1504 and the first representation of a [[wind rose]].\n\nWith his son, cartographer [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Lopo Homem]], they participated in the making of the atlas known as \"Lopo Homem-Rein\u00e9s Atlas\" or \"[[Miller Atlas]]\", in 1519. They were considered the best cartographers of their time. Emperor Charles V wanted them to work for him. In 1517 King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] handed Lopo Homem a charter giving him the privilege to certify and amend all [[compass]] needles in vessels.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe third phase of nautical cartography was characterized by the abandonment of [[Ptolemy]]'s representation of the East and more accuracy in the representation of lands and continents. [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] (Goa \u22481520 \u2013 \u22481580), produced work of extraordinary quality and beauty, giving him a reputation as one of the best cartographers of the time.

They colonized much of the world for Spain and Portugal in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.\n\nAfter the [[Spain|Spanish]] discovery of the [[West Indies]] in 1492, the Spanish, primarily nobles from the west and south of Spain, began building up an American empire in the Caribbean, using islands such as [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Hispaniola]] as bases. From 1519 to 1521, [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] waged a [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|campaign]] against the [[Aztec Empire]], ruled by [[Moctezuma II]]. From the territories of the Aztec Empire conquistadors expanded Spanish rule to northern Central America and parts of what is now southern and western United States and from Mexico sailing the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the [[Philippines]]. Other conquistadors took over the [[Inca Empire]] after crossing the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and sailing the Pacific to northern [[Peru]]. As [[Francisco Pizarro]] [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|subdued the empire]] in a manner similar to Cort\u00e9s other conquistadores used Peru as base for conquering much of [[Ecuador]] and [[Chile]]. In [[Colombia]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Argentina]] conquistadors from Peru linked up with other conquistadors arriving more directly from the Caribbean and [[R\u00edo de la Plata]]-[[Paraguay]] respectively. All this conquests founded the basis for modern [[Hispanic America]] and the [[Hispanophone]]. \n\nBesides conquests, Spanish conquistadors made significant explorations into the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon Jungle]], [[Patagonia]], the interior of North America, and the discovery and exploration of the Pacific Ocean. Conquistadors founded numerous cities, many of them on locations with pre-existing pre-colonial settlements including [[Manila]] and the capitals of most Latin American countries. \n\nConquistadors in the service of the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese Crown]] led numerous conquests for the Portuguese Empire, across [[South America]] and [[Africa]], as well as commercial colonies in Asia, founding the origins of modern [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries|Portuguese-speaking world]] in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Notable Portuguese conquistadors include [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] who led conquests across [[India]], the [[Persian Gulf]], the East Indies, and [[East Africa]], and [[Filipe de Brito e Nicote]] who led conquests into [[Burma]] and was made King of [[Bago Region|Pegu]].\n\n==Conquest==\n[[File:La Rendici\u00f3n de Granada - Pradilla.jpg|thumb|The surrender of [[Granada]] in 1492.

Following the discovery in 1492 by Spaniards of the New World with [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first voyage there and the first [[circumnavigation]] of the world by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]] in 1521, expeditions led by conquistadors in the 16th century established trading routes linking Europe with all these areas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ferdinand Magellan |url=https://www.history.com/topics/exploration/ferdinand-magellan#section_4 |website=History |publisher=A&E Television Networks |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nHuman infections gained worldwide transmission vectors for the first time: from Africa and Eurasia to the Americas and ''vice versa''.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16485469 | doi=10.3201/eid1112.050501 | volume=11 | issue=12 | title=Person-to-person transmission of Andes virus | pmc=3367635 | year=2005 | journal=Emerging Infect.

Their units (''compa\u00f1ia'') would often specialize in forms of combat that required long periods of training that were too costly for informal groups. Their armies were mostly composed of Iberian and other European soldiers.\n\nNative allied troops were largely infantry equipped with armament and armour that varied geographically. Some groups consisted of young men without military experience, [[Catholic clergy]] which helped with administrative duties, and soldiers with military training. These native forces often included African slaves and Native Americans. They not only fought in the battlefield but served as interpreters, informants, servants, teachers, physicians, and scribes. [[India Catalina]] and [[La Malinche|Malintzin]] were Native American women slaves who worked for the Spaniards.\n\nCastilian law prohibited foreigners and non-Catholics from settling in the New World. However, not all conquistadors were Castilian. Many foreigners Hispanicised their names and/or converted to Catholicism to serve the Castilian Crown. For example, [[Juan de Fuca|Io\u00e1nnis Fok\u00e1s]] (known as Juan de Fuca) was a Castilian of Greek origin who discovered the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca|strait that bears his name]] between [[Vancouver Island]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] in 1592. German-born [[Nikolaus Federmann]], Hispanicised as Nicol\u00e1s de Federm\u00e1n, was a ''conquistador'' in Venezuela and Colombia. The Venetian [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastiano Caboto]] was Sebasti\u00e1n Caboto, [[Georg von Speyer]] Hispanicised as Jorge de la Espira, Eusebio Francesco Chini Hispanicised as [[Eusebio Kino]], [[Wenceslaus Linck]] was Wenceslao Linck, [[Ferdinand Kon\u0161\u010dak]], was Fernando Consag, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] was Am\u00e9rico Vespucio, and the Portuguese [[Aleixo Garcia]] was known as Alejo Garc\u00eda in the Castilian army.\n\nThe origin of many people in mixed expeditions was not always distinguished. Various occupations, such as sailors, fishermen, soldiers and nobles employed different languages (even from unrelated language groups), so that crew and settlers of Iberian empires recorded as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicians]] from Spain were actually using Portuguese, Basque, Catalan, Italian and [[Occitan|Languedoc]] languages, which were wrongly identified.\n\nCastilian law banned Spanish women from travelling to America unless they were married and accompanied by a husband. Women who travelled thus include Mar\u00eda de Escobar, [[Mar\u00eda Estrada]], Marina V\u00e9lez de Ortega, Marina de la Caballer\u00eda, Francisca de Valenzuela, Catalina de Salazar. Some conquistadors married Native American women or had illegitimate children.\n[[File:ROHM D195 The conquistadors pray before entry to tenochtitlan.jpg|upright|thumb|Conquistadors praying before a battle at [[Tenochtitlan]]]]\nEuropean young men enlisted in the army because it was one way out of poverty. Catholic priests instructed the soldiers in mathematics, writing, theology, Latin, Greek, and history, and wrote letters and official documents for them. King's army officers taught military arts. An uneducated young recruit could become a military leader, elected by their fellow professional soldiers, perhaps based on merit. Others were born into [[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgo]] families, and as such they were members of the Spanish [[nobility]] with some studies but without economic resources. Even some rich nobility families' members became soldiers or missionaries, but mostly not the firstborn heirs.\n\nThe two most famous conquistadors were [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] who conquered the [[Aztec Empire]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] who led the conquest of the [[Incan Empire]]. They were second cousins born in [[Extremadura]], where many of the Spanish conquerors were born.\nCatholic religious orders that participated and supported the exploration, evangelizing and pacifying, were mostly [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Carmelites]], [[Franciscan Order|Franciscans]] and [[Jesuit Order|Jesuits]], for example [[Francis Xavier]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]], [[Eusebio Kino]], [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]] or [[Gaspar da Cruz]]. In 1536, Dominican friar Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas went to [[Oaxaca]] to participate in a series of discussions and debates among the Bishops of the Dominican and Franciscan orders. The two orders had very different approaches to the conversion of the Indians. The Franciscans used a method of mass conversion, sometimes baptizing many thousands of Indians in a day. This method was championed by prominent Franciscans such as [[Toribio de Benavente]].\n\nThe conquistadors took many different roles, including religious leader, [[harem]] keeper, King or Emperor, deserter and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] warrior. ''[[Caramuru]]'' was a Portuguese settler in the [[Tupi people|Tupinamb\u00e1]] Indians. [[Gonzalo Guerrero]] was a Mayan war leader for Nachan can, Lord of [[Chactemal]]. [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]], who had taken holy orders in his native Spain was captured by Mayan lords too, and later was a soldier with Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. Francisco Pizarro had children with more than 40 women. The [[chronicler]]s [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]], [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo]], [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]], [[Juan de Castellanos]] and friar [[Pedro Sim\u00f3n]] wrote about the Americas.\n[[File:Atawallpa Pizarro tinkuy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francisco Pizarro]] meets with the Inca emperor [[Atahualpa]], 1532]]\n\nAfter Mexico fell, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's enemies, [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], [[Diego Columbus]] and [[Francisco Garay]]<ref>p30-31 of J.H.

After present-day Peruvian territories fell to Spain, [[Francisco Pizarro]] dispatched ''El Adelantado'', [[Diego de Almagro]], before they became enemies to the Inca Empire's northern city of [[Quito]] to claim it. Their fellow conquistador [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]], who had gone forth without Pizarro's approval, had already reached Quito. The arrival of [[Pedro de Alvarado]] from the lands known today as [[Mexico]] in search of Inca gold further complicated the situation for De Almagro and Belalc\u00e1zar. De Alvarado left South America in exchange for monetary compensation from Pizarro. De Almagro was executed in 1538, by [[Hernando Pizarro]]'s orders. In 1541 Lima, supporters of [[Diego Almagro II]] assassinated Francisco Pizarro. In 1546, De Belalc\u00e1zar ordered the execution of [[Jorge Robledo (conquistador)|Jorge Robledo]], who governed a neighbouring province in yet another land-related vendetta. De Belalc\u00e1zar was tried in absentia, convicted and condemned for killing Robledo and other offenses pertaining to his involvement in the wars between armies of conquistadors. [[Pedro de Urs\u00faa]] was killed by his subordinate [[Lope de Aguirre]] who crowned himself king while searching for ''[[El Dorado]]''. In 1544, Lope de Aguirre and [[Melchor Verdugo]] (a ''[[converso]]'' Jew) were at the side of Peru's first viceroy Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, who had arrived from Spain with orders to implement the [[New Laws]] and suppress the [[encomienda]]s. [[Gonzalo Pizarro]], [[Pizarro brothers|another brother]] of Francisco Pizarro, rose in revolt, killed viceroy [[Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela]] and most of his Spanish army in the battle in 1546, and Gonzalo attempted to have himself crowned king.\n\nThe Emperor commissioned bishop [[Pedro de la Gasca]] to restore the peace, naming him president of the ''[[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]]'' and providing him with unlimited authority to punish and pardon the rebels. Gasca repealed the [[New Laws]], the issue around which the rebellion had been organized. Gasca convinced [[Pedro de Valdivia]], explorer of Chile, [[Alonso de Alvarado]] another searcher for ''El Dorado'', and others that if he were unsuccessful, a royal fleet of 40 ships and 15,000 men was preparing to sail from [[Seville]] in June.{{clarify|what year??|date=June 2012}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Portrait of Francisco Pizarro.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Francisco Pizarro]]\n\n===Early Portuguese period===\n[[File:Cortez & La Malinche.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and his counsellor, the Indian woman [[La Malinche]] meet [[Moctezuma II]] in [[Tenochtitlan]], 8 November 1519.

In 1415, Portugal conquered [[Ceuta]], its first overseas colony.\n\nThroughout the 15th century, [[European exploration of Africa#Portuguese explorers|Portuguese explorers]] sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for [[Economic history of Portugal#15th century|tradable commodities]] such as firearms, spices, silver, gold, and [[slavery|slaves]] crossing Africa and India. In 1434 the first consignment of [[slaves]] was brought to [[Lisbon]]; slave trading was the most profitable branch of Portuguese commerce until the Indian subcontinent was reached.\n\n===Birth of the Spanish Kingdom===\nAfter his father's death in 1479, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II of Arag\u00f3n]] unified Castile with Arag\u00f3n, creating the [[Kingdom of Spain]].

Ferdinand notably supported Columbus's first voyage that launched the conquistadors into action.\n\n===Treaties===\nThe 1492 discovery of the [[New World]] by Spain rendered desirable a [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of the Spanish and Portuguese spheres of exploration. Thus dividing the world into two exploration and colonizing areas seemed appropriate. This was accomplished by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] (7 June 1494) which modified the delimitation authorized by [[Pope Alexander VI]] in two [[papal bull|bulls]] issued on 4 May 1493. The treaty gave to Portugal all lands which might be discovered east of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] drawn from the [[Arctic]] Pole to the [[Antarctic]], at a distance of {{convert|370|league}} west of [[Cape Verde]]. Spain received the lands west of this line.\n\nThe known means of measuring [[longitude]] were so inexact that the line of demarcation could not in practice be determined,<ref>J. de Andrade Corvo in ''Journal das Ci\u00eancias Matem\u00e1ticas'', xxxi.147\u2013176, Lisbon, 1881</ref> subjecting the treaty to diverse interpretations.

War with the Dutch led to invasions of many countries in Asia, including Ceylon and commercial interests in Japan, Africa ([[History of Gabon|Mina]]), and South America. Even though the Portuguese were unable to capture the entire island of Ceylon, they were able to control its coastal regions for a considerable time.\n\nFrom 1580 to 1670 mostly, the [[Bandeirantes]] in Brazil focused on slave hunting, then from 1670 to 1750 they focused on mineral wealth.

The large area of Bahia and its city, the strategically important Salvador, was recovered quickly by an Iberian military expedition in 1625.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal re-established authority over its lost territories including remaining Dutch controlled areas. The other smaller, less developed areas were recovered in stages and relieved of Dutch piracy in the next two decades by local resistance and Portuguese expeditions.\n\n[[Spanish Formosa]] was established in Taiwan, first by Portugal in 1544 and later renamed and repositioned by Spain in [[Keelung]].

Stories included the half-fabulous Christian Empire of \"[[Prester John]]\", the kingdom of the [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|White Queen]] on the \"Western Nile\" ([[S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River]]), the [[Fountain of Youth]], cities of Gold in North and South America such as [[Quivira]], [[Zuni-Cibola Complex]], and [[El Dorado]], and wonderful kingdoms of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] and women named [[Amazons]]. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]], naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have fought there. Others claimed that the similarity between \"Indio\" and \"Iudio\", the word for Jew in Spanish language about 1500, revealed the indigenous peoples' origin. Portuguese traveller [[Antonio de Montezinos]] reported that some of the Lost Tribes were living among the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans of the Andes in South America]].

They found other [[precious metals]] such as silver, which was particularly abundant in [[Potos\u00ed]], in modern-day Bolivia. They discovered new routes, [[ocean current]]s, [[trade winds]], crops, spices and other products. In the sail era knowledge of winds and currents was essential, for example, the [[Agulhas current]] long prevented Portuguese sailors from reaching India. Various places in Africa and the Americas have been named after the imagined cities made of gold, rivers of gold and precious stones.\n\nShipwrecked off [[Santa Catarina (island)|Santa Catarina island]] in present-day Brazil, [[Aleixo Garcia]] living among the Guaran\u00eds heard tales of a \"White King\" who lived to the west, ruling cities of incomparable riches and splendour. Marching westward in 1524 to find the land of the \"White King\", he was the first European to cross South America from the East. He discovered a great waterfall{{clarify|where?|date=July 2012}} and the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco Plain]]. He managed to penetrate the outer defences of the [[Inca Empire]] on the hills of the [[Andes]], in present-day [[Bolivia]], the first European to do so, eight years before Francisco Pizarro.\nGarcia looted a booty of silver. When the army of [[Huayna C\u00e1pac]] arrived to challenge him, Garcia then retreated with the spoils, only to be assassinated by his Indian allies near [[San Pedro, Paraguay|San Pedro]] on the [[Paraguay River]].\n\n==Secrecy and disinformation==\n[[File:California island Vinckeboons5.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|Map of the [[Island of California]], circa 1650; restored.]]\nThe Spanish discovery of what they thought at that time was India, and the constant competition of Portugal and Spain led to a desire for secrecy about every trade route and every colony. As a consequence, many documents that could reach other European countries included fake dates and faked facts, to mislead any other nation's possible efforts. For example, the [[Island of California]] refers to a famous [[cartography|cartographic]] error propagated on many maps during the 17th and 18th centuries, despite contradictory evidence from various explorers. The legend was initially infused with the idea that California was a terrestrial paradise, peopled by black women [[Amazons]].\n\nThe tendency to secrecy and falsification of dates casts doubts about the authenticity of many [[primary sources]]. Several historians have hypothesized that John II may have known of the existence of Brazil and North America as early as 1480, thus explaining his wish in 1494 at the signing of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], to push the line of influence further west. Many historians suspect that the real documents{{clarify|which real documents?|date=July 2012}} would have been placed in the Library of Lisbon. Unfortunately, a fire following the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] destroyed nearly all of the library's records, but an extra copy{{clarify|copy of what?|date=July 2012}} available in Goa was transferred to Lisbon's Tower of Tombo, during the following 100 years.

He established direct royal control with the [[Council of the Indies]], the most important administrative organ of the [[Spanish Empire]], both in the Americas and in Asia. After unifying Castile, Ferdinand introduced to Castile many laws, regulations and institutions such as the [[Inquisition]], that were typical in Aragon. These laws were later used in the new lands.\n\nThe [[Laws of Burgos]], created in 1512\u20131513, were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of settlers in Spanish colonial America, particularly with regards to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. They forbade the maltreatment of indigenous people, and endorsed their conversion to Catholicism.\n\nThe evolving structure of colonial government was not fully formed until the third quarter of the 16th century; however, ''[[Catholic Monarchs|los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos]]'' designated [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca]] to study the problems related to the colonization process. Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca effectively became minister for the Indies and laid the foundations for the creation of a colonial bureaucracy, combining legislative, executive and judicial functions. Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca presided over the council, which contained a number of members of the [[Council of Castile]] (''Consejo de Castilla''), and formed a ''Junta de Indias'' of about eight counsellors. Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was already using the term \"[[Council of the Indies]]\" in 1519.\n[[File:Portrait of Philip II of Spain by Sofonisba Anguissola - 002b.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Philip II of Spain]] (1527\u20131598).]]\n\nThe Crown reserved for itself important tools of intervention. The \"capitulacion\" clearly stated that the conquered territories belonged to the Crown, not to the individual. On the other hand, ''concessions'' allowed the Crown to guide the Companies conquests to certain territories, depending on their interests. In addition, the leader of the expedition received clear instructions about their duties towards the army, the native population, the type of military action. A written report about the results was mandatory. The army had a royal official, the \"veedor\". The \"veedor\" or notary, ensured they complied with orders and instructions and preserved the King's share of the booty.\n\nIn practice the Capit\u00e1n had almost unlimited power. Besides the Crown and the conquistador, they were very important the backers who were charged with anticipating the money to the Capit\u00e1n and guarantee payment of obligations.\n\nArmed groups sought supplies and funds in various ways. Financing was requested from the King, delegates of the Crown, the nobility, rich merchants or the troops themselves. The more professional campaigns were funded by the Crown. Campaigns were sometimes initiated by inexperienced governors, because in [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Colonial America]], offices were bought or handed to relatives or cronies. Sometimes, an expedition of conquistadors were a group of influential men who had recruited and equipped their fighters, by promising a share of the booty.\n\nThe conquistador borrowed as little as possible, preferring to invest all their belongings. Sometimes, every soldier brought his own equipment and supplies, other times the soldiers received gear as an advance from the conquistador.\n\nThe [[Pinz\u00f3n brothers]], seamen of the [[R\u00edo Tinto (river)|Tinto]]\u2013[[Odiel]] participated in Columbus's undertaking.<ref name = \"ortegamartin\">{{Harvnb|Ortega|1980|loc=Tomo III, p. 37-110}}</ref> They also supported the project economically, supplying money from their personal fortunes.<ref name = \"LascasasPinz\u00f3n\">{{cite book |last= de las Casas|first= Bartolom\u00e9|authorlink= Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas|title= Historia de las Indias| url = http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12033856617830495876213/index.htm|accessdate= 18 October 2008|chapter= Tomo I.

The contribution of each individual conditioned the subsequent division of the booty, receiving a portion the pawn (lancero, piquero, alabardero, rodelero) and twice a man on horseback (caballero) owner of a horse.{{clarify|date=March 2013}} Sometimes part of the booty consisted of women and/or slaves. Even the dogs, important weapons of war in their own right, were in some cases rewarded. The division of the booty produced conflicts, such as the one between Pizarro and Almagro.\n\n==Military advantages==\n[[File:Mendoza, Villagra y Quiroga segun Ovalle.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alonso de Ovalle]]'s 1646 engraving of the conquistadors [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Pedro de Villagra]] and [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]]]] \n[[File:Cabeza reducida J\u00edbaro (M.

In 1599, the Jivaro destroyed Spanish settlements in eastern Ecuador and killed all the men.]]\n\nConquistadors had overwhelming military advantages over the native peoples. They belonged to a more militarily advanced civilization with better techniques, tools, firearms, artillery, iron, steel and domesticated animals. Horses and mules carried them, pigs fed them and dogs fought for them. The indigenous peoples had the advantage of established settlements, determination to remain independent and large numerical superiority. European diseases and [[divide and rule|divide and conquer]] tactics contributed to the defeat of the native populations.\n[[File:Los 13 de la Isla del Gallo.jpg|thumb|left|A group of 16th century conquistadors that participated in the Spanish conquest of Peru (second expedition) along with their leader, [[Francisco Pizarro]].]]\nIn the Iberian peninsula, in a situation of constant conflict, warfare and daily life were strongly interlinked. Small, lightly equipped armies were maintained at all times. The state of war continued intermittently for centuries and created a very warlike culture in Iberia.\n\n===Strategy===\nAnother factor was the ability of the conquistadors to manipulate the political situation between indigenous peoples. To beat the [[Inca]] civilization, they supported one side of a civil war. They overthrew the [[Aztec]] civilization by allying with natives who had been subjugated by more powerful neighbouring tribes and kingdoms. These tactics had been used since antiquity, for example, in the [[Granada War]], the [[conquest of the Canary Islands]] and [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|conquest of Navarre]]. Throughout the conquest, the indigenous people greatly outnumbered the conquistadors; the conquistador troops never exceeded 2% of the native population. The army with which [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] besieged [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|Tenochtitlan]] was composed of 200,000 soldiers, of which fewer than 1% were Spaniards.<ref name=Mann/>{{rp|178}}\n\nThe Europeans practiced war within the terms and laws of their concept of a ''[[just war]]''. While Spanish soldiers went to the battlefield to kill their enemies, the Aztecs and [[Maya peoples|Mayas]] captured their enemies for use as sacrificial victims to their gods\u2014a process called \"[[flower war]]\" by Spanish historians.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn traditional cultures of the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], and [[hunter-gatherer]] societies the warfare was mostly 'endemic', long duration, low intensity, usually evolving into almost a ritualized form. By contrast, Europe had moved to 'sporadic' warfare in the Middle Ages due to the availability of professionally mercenary armies.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} When Italy was ransacked by French and Spanish Armies in the early 1500s, most Italian states were easily defeated by armies practicing sporadic-warfare. Aztec and other native peoples practiced an endemic system of warfare as well, and so were easily defeated by Spanish and Portuguese sporadic-warfare armies in the early 1500s.\n\n===Tactics===\nThese forces were capable of quickly moving long distances, allowing a quick return home after battle. Wars were mainly between clans, expelling intruders. On land, these wars combined some European methods with techniques from Muslim bandits in [[Al-Andalus]]. These tactics consisted of small groups who attempted to catch their opponents by surprise, through an ambush.\n\nIn [[Mombasa]], [[Vasco da Gama|Dom Vasco da Gama]] resorted to [[piracy]], looting Arab merchant ships, which were generally unarmed trading vessels without heavy cannons.\n\n===Equipment and animals===\n\n====Firearms and crossbows====\nEuropean conquistadors in the Americas made extensive use of [[crossbow]]s, with firearms becoming widespread only from the 1570s.<ref name=Espino2012>{{cite journal |last1=Espino L\u00f3pez |first1=Antonio |date=2012 |title=El uso t\u00e1ctico de las armas de fuego en las guerras civiles peruanas (1538-1547) |journal=Historica|language=Spanish |volume=XXXVI |issue=2 |pages=7\u201348 |access-date= }}</ref> A scarcity of firearms did not prevent conquistadors to pioneer the use mounted arquebusiers, an early form of [[dragoon]].<ref name=Espino2012/> In the 1540s [[Francisco de Carvajal]]'s use of firearms in the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|Spanish civil war in Peru]] prefigured the [[volley fire]] technique that developed in Europe many decades after.<ref name=Espino2012/>\n\n====Animals====\n[[File:1898 urtoko pottoka eta artzanora.jpg|thumb|left|Basque Countrymen near the France\u2013Spain border in 1898, with characteristic horse, donkey and dogs. These were the type of animals introduced to America.]]\n[[File:Mastspagn3.jpg|thumb|Spanish Mastiff used in expeditions and guard]] \nAnimals were another important factor for Spanish triumph. On the one hand, the introduction of the horse and other domesticated pack animals allowed them greater mobility unknown to the Indian cultures. However, in the mountains and jungles, the Spaniards were less able to use narrow Amerindian roads and bridges made for pedestrian traffic, which were sometimes no wider than a few feet. In places such as [[History of Argentina#Spanish colonial era|Argentina]], [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|New Mexico]] and [[History of California to 1899#Spanish colonization and governance (1697\u20131821)|California]], the indigenous people learned horsemanship, cattle raising, and sheep herding. The use of the new techniques by indigenous groups later became a disputed factor in native resistance to the colonial and American governments.\n\nThe Spaniards were also skilled at breeding dogs for war, hunting and protection. The [[Molosser]]s, [[Alano Espa\u00f1ol|Spanish war dogs]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Derr | first = Mark | title = A Dog's History of America | publisher = North Point Press | year = 2004 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/dogshistoryofame00mark/page/23 23\u201345] | isbn = 978-0-86547-631-8 | lay-url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57784-2004Sep2.html | url = https://archive.org/details/dogshistoryofame00mark/page/23 }}</ref> and [[Livestock guardian dog|sheep dogs]] they used in battle were effective as a psychological weapon against the natives, who, in many cases, had never seen domesticated dogs. Although some indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere did have domestic dogs, including the current Southwestern US, Aztec and other Central American peoples, the inhabitants of the Arctic/Tundra regions (Inuit, Aleut, Cree), and possibly some South American groups similar to South American fox (''[[Pseudalopex culpaeus]]'') or Yagan dog,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theobligatescientist.blogspot.com/2010/07/monday-mammal-10-yagan-dog.html|title=Monday Mammal #10: Yag\u00e1n \"dog\"|last=Paul|website=TheObligateScientist.Blogspot.com|access-date=30 May 2017}}</ref> during the conquest of the Americas, Spanish conquistadors used [[Spanish Mastiff]]s and other [[Molossers]] in battle against the [[Ta\u00ednos]], [[Aztecs]] and [[Mayans]]. These specially trained dogs were feared because of their strength and ferocity. The strongest big breeds of broad-mouthed dogs were [[Attack dog|specifically trained]] for battle. These [[Dogs in warfare|war dogs]] were used against barely clothed troops. They were armoured dogs trained to kill and disembowel.<ref name=Stannard>{{cite book|title=American holocaust: the conquest of the New World|first=David |last=Stannard}}</ref>\n\nThe most famous of these dogs of war was a mascot of [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n|Ponce de Leon]] called ''Becerrillo'', the first European dog known to reach North America;{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} another famous dog called ''Leoncico'', the son of ''Becerillo'', and the first European dog known to see the Pacific Ocean, was a mascot of [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] and accompanied him on several expeditions.\n\n==Nautical science==\n[[File:AlmanachPerpetuum.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ephemeris]] by [[Abraham Zacuto]] in Almanach Perpetuum, 1496]]\n\nThe successive expeditions and experience of the Portuguese pilots led to a rapid evolution of Portuguese nautical science.\n\n===Navigation===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\nIn the thirteenth century they were guided by the sun position. For [[celestial navigation]] like other Europeans, they used Greek tools, like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], which they made easier and simpler. They also created the [[cross-staff]], or ''cane of Jacob'', for measuring at sea the height of the sun and other stars. The [[Southern Cross]] became a reference upon the arrival of [[Jo\u00e3o de Santar\u00e9m]] and [[Pedro Escobar]] in the Southern hemisphere in 1471, starting its use in celestial navigation. The results varied throughout the year, which required corrections. To address this the Portuguese used the astronomical tables ([[Ephemeris]]), a precious tool for oceanic navigation, which spread widely in the fifteenth century. These tables revolutionized navigation, enabling [[latitude]] calculations. The tables of the [[Almanach Perpetuum]], by astronomer [[Abraham Zacuto]], published in Leiria in 1496, were used along with its improved astrolabe, by [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]].\n\n===Ship design===\n{{Main|Iberian ship development, 1400\u20131600}}\n[[File:Caravel Boa Esperanca Portugal.jpg|thumb|left|A Portuguese [[caravel]]]]\nThe ship that truly launched the first phase of the discoveries along the African coast was the Portuguese [[caravel]]. Iberians quickly adopted it for their merchant navy. It was a development based on African fishing boats. They were agile and easier to navigate, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and one to three masts, with [[lateen]] triangular sails allowing [[luffing]]. The caravel particularly benefited from a greater capacity to [[tack (sailing)|tack]]. The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks, but have not hindered its success. Limited crew and cargo space was acceptable, initially, because as exploratory ships, their \"cargo\" was what was in the explorer's discoveries about a new territory, which only took up the space of one person.<ref>[[Roger Smith (journalist)|Roger Smith]], \"Vanguard of the Empire\", Oxford University Press, 1993, p.30</ref> Among the famous caravels are ''Berrio'' and ''Caravela Annunciation''. Columbus also used them in his travels.\n\nLong oceanic voyages led to larger ships. \"Nau\" was the Portuguese archaic synonym for any large ship, primarily [[merchant ship]]s. Due to the piracy that plagued the coasts, they began to be used in the navy and were provided with cannon windows, which led to the classification of \"naus\" according to the power of its artillery. The [[carrack]] or nau was a three- or four-[[Mast (sailing)|masted]] ship. It had a high rounded [[stern]] with large [[aftcastle]], [[forecastle]] and [[bowsprit]] at the stem. It was first used by the Portuguese, and later by the Spanish. They were also adapted to the increasing maritime trade. They grew from 200 tons capacity in the 15th century to 500. In the 16th century they usually had two [[deck (ship)|decks]], stern castles fore and aft, two to four masts with overlapping sails. In India travels in the sixteenth century used carracks, large merchant ships with a high edge and three masts with square sails, that reached 2,000 tons.\n\n===Winds and currents===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|Map of the five major [[oceanic gyre]]s]]\nBesides coastal exploration, Portuguese ships also made trips further out to gather [[meteorological]] and [[oceanographic]] information. These voyages revealed the archipelagos of [[Bissagos Islands]] where the Portuguese were defeated by native people in 1535, Madeira, the Azores, Cape Verde, Sao Tome, [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]], [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Corisco]], [[Elobey Grande]], [[Elobey Chico]] [[Annobon Island]], [[Ascension Island]], [[Bioko Island]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Principe Island]], [[Saint Helena|Saint Helena Island]], [[Tristan da Cunha]] Island and [[Sargasso Sea]].\n\nThe knowledge of wind patterns and [[ocean current|currents]], the [[trade winds]] and the [[oceanic gyre]]s in the Atlantic, and the determination of latitude led to the discovery of the best ocean route back from Africa: crossing the Central Atlantic to the Azores, using the winds and currents that spin clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere because of [[atmospheric circulation]] and the effect of [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis]], facilitating the way to Lisbon and thus enabling the Portuguese to venture farther from shore, a manoeuvre that became known as the ''\"volta do mar\"'' (''return of the sea''). In 1565, the application of this principle in the Pacific Ocean led the Spanish discovering the [[Manila Galleon]] trade route.\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Map of Angelino Dulcert cropped.jpg|thumb| Portolan of [[Angelino Dulcert]] (1339) showing [[Lanzarote]] island]]\n\nIn 1339 [[Angelino Dulcert]] of Majorca produced the [[portolan chart]] map.

Majorca had many skilled Jewish cartographers. However, the oldest signed Portuguese sea chart is a Portolan made by [[Pedro Reinel]] in 1485 representing the Western Europe and parts of Africa, reflecting the explorations made by [[Diogo C\u00e3o]]. Reinel was also author of the first nautical chart known with an indication of latitudes in 1504 and the first representation of a [[wind rose]].\n\nWith his son, cartographer [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Lopo Homem]], they participated in the making of the atlas known as \"Lopo Homem-Rein\u00e9s Atlas\" or \"[[Miller Atlas]]\", in 1519. They were considered the best cartographers of their time. Emperor Charles V wanted them to work for him. In 1517 King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] handed Lopo Homem a charter giving him the privilege to certify and amend all [[compass]] needles in vessels.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe third phase of nautical cartography was characterized by the abandonment of [[Ptolemy]]'s representation of the East and more accuracy in the representation of lands and continents.
