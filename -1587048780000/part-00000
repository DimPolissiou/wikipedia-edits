This is the first season of the ''[[Total Drama]]'' series and has 26 episodes, each 22 minutes in duration<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elliottanimation.com/productions/totaldramaisland/details.htm|title=Elliott Animation - Productions - Total Drama Island|access-date=2007-07-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715131925/http://www.elliottanimation.com/productions/totaldramaisland/details.htm|archive-date=2007-07-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> with a special 44 minute episode at the end. The season is mostly a parody of the series ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'', and features 22 campers in an elimination-based competition. On Cartoon Network, airing in the United States, some content has been removed from the episodes by censors in order to keep the rating open to a younger audience; for example, putting in words instead of long [[Bleep censor|bleeps]], and censoring of sensitive body parts, for the episodes \"That's Off the Chain\" and \"Trial by Tri-Armed Triathlon\". The fourth season, ''[[Total Drama: Revenge of the Island]]'', takes place on the same island as this season, but with an all-new cast. ''Total Drama Island'' was created by [[Tom McGillis]] and [[Jennifer Pertsch]] with their production studio, [[Fresh TV]], which also created their previous animated series, ''[[6teen]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:TDIsland.png|thumb|right|A grand view of the main setting used in this season (which is artificially recreated in the [[Total Drama Action|next season]]). The island is also used in [[Total Drama: Revenge of the Island|the fourth]] and [[Total Drama All-Stars and Pahkitew Island|fifth season]]s (which leads to its destruction).]]\n''Total Drama Island'' is set in the fictional titular reality show, which follows the competition of 22 unsuspecting and unknowing teenagers at Camp Wawanakwa, the most rundown, bug-infested, disgusting island located in an unspecified area in [[Muskoka]], [[Ontario]]. The campers participate in competitions and challenges which get more insane and dangerous each week to avoid being voted off the island by their fellow campers and teammates. At the end of the series, the winning contestant will receive {{currency|100,000|CAD}} AND DO SEX. The competition is hosted by Chris McLean, assisted by the camp's chef, Chef Hatchet, who is also Chris' best friend despite being mistreated at times. Egotistical and immoral, unless something affects him legally, Chris places the show's contestants in various life-threatening challenges.\n\nAt the beginning of the season, the twenty-two 16-year-old campers are placed into two groups of eleven, the \"Screaming Gophers\" and the \"Killer Bass\". In each episode, the teams participate in HAVING SEX AND a challenge, in which one or more campers can win invincibility for their team. The losing team is called to the campfire that night, where they vote one of their members off the island. The camper with the most votes is eliminated from the competition. At this campfire, McLean passes out marshmallows to the campers who have not been voted off, while the one who does not get a marshmallow must walk down the Dock of Shame to the Boat of Losers, which will take them away from the island and they will \"never, never, never, ever, ever, ever, come back, ever\" according to Chris (this was proved a lie in \"No Pain, No Game\", when he brought Eva and Izzy back into the game).\n\nAbout halfway through the season, the teams are disbanded, so it is every camper for themselves, after which the challenges continue; the winner of each challenge then only receives invincibility AND DO PORN for him or herself, whereupon the rest of the campers vote one camper without invincibility off the island. This process of elimination continued on until two players remain on the island. These two players were then subject to a final contest. ''Total Drama Island'' is a parody of the reality show ''[[Survivor (franchise)|Survivor]]''. Host Chris McLean is very similar to ''Survivor'' host [[Jeff Probst]].<ref name = \"monitor\">{{Citation| author = Aaron Sagers| title = Pop 20: If Facebook were a dinner party| newspaper = The Monitor| issue =| page =| date = September 1, 2009}}</ref> This is the first season in which the winner does not get to keep the money, due to it being eaten by a shark in the episode \"Total Drama Drama Drama Drama Island\".\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Total Drama Island episodes}}\n''Total Drama Island'' is a Canadian animated television series which premiered on July 8, 2007, on the [[Teletoon]] channel.

Thanks to her background, she never developed proper social skills, and while she excels at getting others to stop and stare, it is more often than not for embarrassing reasons. In the third episode of ''Total Drama Island'', she joins a three-way alliance between Heather, Lindsay, and herself, but leaves it after standing up to Heather and her bossy attitude.\n|-\n| {{va|Bridgette}}\n| [[Kristin Fairlie]]\n| The Surfer Girl\n| {{nts|10}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Bridgette is a calm, compassionate surfer girl who loves animals almost as much as she loves the water. She ends up being the last girl standing on the Killer Bass, leading her to form a friendship with Gwen and Leshawna after the team merge. She develops a crush on Geoff and the two eventually become a couple.\n|-\n| {{va|Cody}}\n| [[Peter Oldring]]\n| The Geek\n| {{nts|17}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Cody is a tech-savvy geek, who sees himself as a ladies' man instead of a nerd. He has a large crush on Gwen and tries unsuccessfully to flirt with her, but settles for making Gwen happy by hooking her up with Trent.\n|-\n| {{va|Courtney}}\n| [[Emilie-Claire Barlow]]{{efn|name=courtneyvoice|Rochelle Wilson voiced Courtney in the first two episodes of the season, \"Not So Happy Campers - Part 1\" and \"Not So Happy Campers - Part 2\".}}\n| The Type A\n| {{nts|14}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Courtney is a perfectionist who desires to be best at everything, and sees herself as a born leader. Her desire for success often clashes with her own principles and can come off as being quite bossy and critical, which leads her to be disliked by many contestants. She has a crush on Duncan, but denies it. Later on in the series, the two form a romantic relationship, leading to her unfair elimination as Harold rigged the votes for Courtney to leave to get back at Duncan for bullying him.\n|-\n| {{va|DJ}}\n| [[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]]\n| The Brickhouse With Heart\n| {{nts|8}}th\n| align=\"left\"| DJ is a very soft-spoken and sensitive guy who is compassionate and kind to those around him despite his intimidating size. He has a fear of heights and snakes, but manages to overcome them as the season progresses.\n|-\n| {{va|Duncan}}\n| [[Drew Nelson (actor)|Drew Nelson]]\n| The Delinquent\n| {{nts|4}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Duncan is a crafty juvenile delinquent and apparent bully who knows many tactics from his time spent in juvenile detention centers. His experience in juvy has made him into a strong and ruthless competitor, but he still shows affection towards his teammates from time to time, particularly towards Courtney. During the merge, he forms a guys alliance with DJ, Geoff, and Owen to help the men stay in the competition. He ends up being tough enough to make it to the final four.\n|-\n| {{va|Eva}}\n| [[Julia Chantrey]]\n| The Female Bully\n| {{nts|12}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Eva is very competitive and physically strong, but she is often overly aggressive. She is known to have a short temper and violent ways of exhibiting her anger. While her temper got her eliminated from the competition early, she was allowed to return to compete after the merge (which lasted one episode because the contestants still didn't want to deal with her violent behavior). Eva is one out of three contestants from the original cast to only compete on ''Total Drama Island'' and not on any of its follow-up seasons.\n|-\n| {{va|Ezekiel}}\n| [[Peter Oldring]]\n| The Home Schooled Guy\n| {{nts|22}}nd (Last)\n| align=\"left\"| Ezekiel is a na\u00efve country boy who was homeschooled at his farm. His lack of interaction with other kids has left him with incredibly poor social skills. He is the first one voted off the competition due to his unintentional sexist remarks towards the female competitors.\n|-\n| {{va|Geoff}}\n| [[Dan Petronijevic]]\n| The Funniest Guy Around\n| {{nts|6}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Geoff may not be the smartest contestant in the bunch, but he has a positive attitude, loves people, and is always up for a party. He forms a strong friendship with DJ and Duncan, and develops a crush on fellow surfer Bridgette. He tries to get closer to her, however, the relationship between the two is often a rocky one, as many of his attempts to impress her instead end up putting her off. As the season progresses, Bridgette shows signs of returning his feelings, and the two officially become a couple.\n|-\n| {{va|Gwen}}\n| [[Megan Fahlenbock]]\n| The Loner\n| {{ntsh|2}}Finalist\n| align=\"left\"| Gwen is a goth girl whose interests lie in art and astronomy. She is smart, independent, kind and level-headed, stating her best quality is her inability to get excited over minuscule things. Her attitude at first seems very harsh and sarcastic, but she is not a bitter person. During the season, she develops a crush on Trent and forms an intense rivalry with her teammate Heather. Despite the numerous physical and social obstacles in her way, Gwen is strong enough to make it to the finale alongside Owen.\n|-\n| {{va|Harold}}\n| [[Brian Froud (actor)|Brian Froud]]\n| The Dweeb\n| {{nts|13}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Harold is a skinny, awkward-looking guy who takes pride in his knowledge, resourcefulness, and \"Mad Skills\" in subjects like filming and beatboxing. He is frequently bullied by Duncan and is often underestimated by his teammates and competitors, as he's pulled through and won challenges for the Killer Bass a number of times despite nearly getting voted off at several elimination ceremonies. It's revealed later in the season that he's developed a large crush on Leshawna.\n|-\n| {{va|Heather}}\n| [[Rachel Wilson]]\n| The Queen Bee\n| {{nts|3}}rd\n| align=\"left\"| Heather competes with her sights solely on the prize money and not on making friends, using others at her advantage and only being kind when she may ultimately be benefited. Early in the season, she forms an alliance with Beth and Lindsay and frequently forces the latter to place Heather's priorities above her own. Despite everyone's hatred towards her (particularly from Gwen and Leshawna), she manages to make it to the final three thanks to either performing strongly in the competition or manipulating others to get what she wants.\n|-\n| {{va|Izzy}}\n| [[Katie Crown]]\n| The Psycho Hose Beast\n| {{nts|7}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Izzy is seen as one of the show's craziest contestants. She is fun but hard to handle and to the other contestants, more trouble than she is worth. Izzy has extraordinary athletic and fighting abilities, and also sticks herself to the wild environment. Early in the season, she is forced to leave the competition after being chased out by the Royal Canadian Mountain Police, but Chris allows her to return after the teams merge into one. During the merge, she develops a strong crush on Owen.\n|-\n| {{va|Justin}}\n| [[Adam Reid]]\n| The Eye Candy\n| {{nts|20}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Justin is a supermodel of incredible beauty. He is so handsome that he can make everyone around, whether they are female, male, or animal, stop dead in his or her tracks at the mere sight of him. While Justin does speak in the first and last episodes of the season, he remains mute for the majority of the time, letting his appearance speak for itself.\n|-\n| {{va|Katie}}\n| [[Stephanie Anne Mills]]\n| The Sweet Girl\n| {{nts|19}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Katie and Sadie are two best friends who do everything together. They are sensitive, cheerful, and boy-crazy and when they grow attracted to someone, they will fawn over him endlessly. After Katie's elimination, Sadie struggles at first to compete without her, but adapts more as she continues. They are two out of three contestants from the original cast to only compete on ''Total Drama Island'' and not any of its follow-up seasons.\n|-\n| {{va|Leshawna}}\n| Novie Edwards\n| The Sister With 'Tude\n| {{nts|5}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Leshawna is loyal and sassy, yet also can be affectionate and caring. If shown respect, she will reciprocate it indefinitely. Leshawna tells it like it is, and has no fear whatsoever of calling people out on their mistakes. She forms a friendship with Gwen and a strong rivalry against Heather.\n|-\n| {{va|Lindsay}}\n| [[Stephanie Anne Mills]]\n| The Dumb Princess\n| {{nts|9}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Lindsay is described as being beautiful, but not vain. While Lindsay is one of the prettiest competitors on the show and is spoilt silly by her father, she is known for having a very big heart inside of her very big chest, which leads to a result that she made friends with almost everyone. Her na\u00efveity also leads to results of her own downfalls often to her teammates, to her competitors and to herself. She forms an alliance with Heather early on in the season and is often forced by her to do various tasks to benefit Heather more than herself. She also begins one of the show's first romances with Tyler alongside having a crush on Trent which is what he is unaware of.\n|-\n| {{va|Noah}}\n| [[Carter Hayden]]\n| The Schemer\n| {{nts|21}}st\n| align=\"left\"| Noah comes off as being sarcastic, cynical, and a bit too lazy. He is extremely intelligent, growing up as a child prodigy, but finds physical activity as laughable as the ridiculous antics of some of his peers.\n|-\n| {{va|Owen}}\n| [[Scott McCord]]\n| The Party Guy\n| {{ntsh|1}}Finalist\n| align=\"left\"| Owen is a huggable, upbeat, fun-loving, friendly, passionate, and optimistic competitor, who is basically in ''Total Drama'' to have fun more than win the grand prize. Owen's three biggest loves are eating, having a good time and passing a large amount of gas. Among his peers, he is arguably the most popular contestant of all time for his cheerful ways, optimistic viewpoints no matter what the situation is, and ability to see the best in other people. Despite his obesity, he makes it to the finale with Gwen thanks to his popularity amongst the cast and surprising athletic abilities. He develops a crush on Izzy while they were walking through the woods in their horror movie survival challenge.\n|-\n| {{va|Sadie}}\n| Lauren Lipson\n| The Sweet Girl's Best Friend\n| {{nts|15}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Sadie and Katie are best friends who do everything together. They are sensitive, cheerful, and boy-crazy and when they are attracted to someone, they fawn over him endlessly. After Katie's elimination, Sadie struggles at first to compete without her, but adapts as she continues. They are two out of three contestants from the original cast to only compete on ''Total Drama Island'' and not any of its follow-up seasons.\n|-\n| {{va|Trent}}\n| [[Scott McCord]]\n| The Cool Guy\n| {{nts|11}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Trent is a relaxed, nice guy who tends to get along with everyone with his social skills and ability to play the guitar. He is also shown as being a pain magnet, suffering a number of near-death experiences and mishaps during the season. He has a crush on Gwen and when the two try to get together, Heather tries to break them apart seeing their affection as a threat towards her alliance.\n|-\n| {{va|Tyler}}\n| [[Peter Oldring]]\n| The Jock\n| {{nts|18}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Tyler is a sports fan who loves anything physical. Unfortunately, he is extremely uncoordinated and dim, constantly putting himself and others at risk with his clumsiness. He and Lindsay become one of the show's first couples.\n|-\n|}\n\n===Episode finale variations===\nFor every season, the show's producers create two alternate endings for the final episode, such that the winner seen in one country's broadcasts is the runner-up in other countries (and vice versa) where the show airs. Owen is the original winner in Canada, but he is also shown as the winner in Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latin America (Cartoon Network), the Middle East, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Portugal, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Gwen is

The season is mostly a parody of the series ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'', and features 22 campers in an elimination-based competition. On Cartoon Network, airing in the United States, some content has been removed from the episodes by censors in order to keep the rating open to a younger audience; for example, putting in words instead of long [[Bleep censor|bleeps]], and censoring of sensitive body parts, for the episodes \"That's Off the Chain\" and \"Trial by Tri-Armed Triathlon\". The fourth season, ''[[Total Drama: Revenge of the Island]]'', takes place on the same island as this season, but with an all-new cast. ''Total Drama Island'' was created by [[Tom McGillis]] and [[Jennifer Pertsch]] with their production studio, [[Fresh TV]], which also created their previous animated series, ''[[6teen]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:TDIsland.png|thumb|right|A grand view of the main setting used in this season (which is artificially recreated in the [[Total Drama Action|next season]]).

The campers participate in competitions and challenges which get more insane and dangerous each week to avoid being voted off the island by their fellow campers and teammates. At the end of the series, the winning contestant will receive {{currency|100,000|CAD}}. The competition is hosted by Chris McLean, assisted by the camp's chef, Chef Hatchet, who is also Chris' best friend despite being mistreated at times. Egotistical and immoral, unless something affects him legally, Chris places the show's contestants in various life-threatening challenges.\n\nAt the beginning of the season, the twenty-two 16-year-old campers are placed into two groups of eleven, the \"Screaming Gophers\" and the \"Killer Bass\". In each episode, the teams participate in a challenge, in which one or more campers can win invincibility for their team. The losing team is called to the campfire that night, where they vote one of their members off the island. The camper with the most votes is eliminated from the competition. At this campfire, McLean passes out marshmallows to the campers who have not been voted off, while the one who does not get a marshmallow must walk down the Dock of Shame to the Boat of Losers, which will take them away from the island and they will \"never, never, never, ever, ever, ever, come back, ever\" according to Chris (this was proved a lie in \"No Pain, No Game\", when he brought Eva and Izzy back into the game).\n\nAbout halfway through the season, the teams are disbanded, so it is every camper for themselves, after which the challenges continue; the winner of each challenge then only receives invincibility for him or herself, whereupon the rest of the campers vote one camper without invincibility off the island. This process of elimination continued on until two players remain on the island. These two players were then subject to a final contest. ''Total Drama Island'' is a parody of the reality show ''[[Survivor (franchise)|Survivor]]''. Host Chris McLean is very similar to ''Survivor'' host [[Jeff Probst]].<ref name = \"monitor\">{{Citation| author = Aaron Sagers| title = Pop 20: If Facebook were a dinner party| newspaper = The Monitor| issue =| page =| date = September 1, 2009}}</ref> This is the first season in which the winner does not get to keep the money, due to it being eaten by a shark in the episode \"Total Drama Drama Drama Drama Island\".\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Total Drama Island episodes}}\n''Total Drama Island'' is a Canadian animated television series which premiered on July 8, 2007, on the [[Teletoon]] channel.

Thanks to her background, she never developed proper social skills, and while she excels at getting others to stop and stare, it is more often than not for embarrassing reasons. In the third episode of ''Total Drama Island'', she joins a three-way alliance between Heather, Lindsay, and herself, but leaves it after standing up to Heather and her bossy attitude.\n|-\n| {{va|Bridgette}}\n| [[Kristin Fairlie]]\n| The Surfer Girl\n| {{nts|10}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Bridgette is a calm, compassionate surfer girl who loves animals almost as much as she loves the water. She ends up being the last girl standing on the Killer Bass, leading her to form a friendship with Gwen and Leshawna after the team merge. She develops a crush on Geoff and the two eventually become a couple.\n|-\n| {{va|Cody}}\n| [[Peter Oldring]]\n| The Geek\n| {{nts|17}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Cody is a tech-savvy geek, who sees himself as a ladies' man instead of a nerd. He has a large crush on Gwen and tries unsuccessfully to flirt with her, but settles for making Gwen happy by hooking her up with Trent.\n|-\n| {{va|Courtney}}\n| [[Emilie-Claire Barlow]]{{efn|name=courtneyvoice|Rochelle Wilson voiced Courtney in the first two episodes of the season, \"Not So Happy Campers - Part 1\" and \"Not So Happy Campers - Part 2\".}}\n| The Type A\n| {{nts|14}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Courtney is a perfectionist who desires to be best at everything, and sees herself as a born leader. Her desire for success often clashes with her own principles and can come off as being quite bossy and critical, which leads her to be disliked by many contestants. She has a crush on Duncan, but denies it. Later on in the series, the two form a romantic relationship, leading to her unfair elimination as Harold rigged the votes for Courtney to leave to get back at Duncan for bullying him.\n|-\n| {{va|DJ}}\n| [[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]]\n| The Brickhouse With Heart\n| {{nts|8}}th\n| align=\"left\"| DJ is a very soft-spoken and sensitive guy who is compassionate and kind to those around him despite his intimidating size. He has a fear of heights and snakes, but manages to overcome them as the season progresses.\n|-\n| {{va|Duncan}}\n| [[Drew Nelson (actor)|Drew Nelson]]\n| The Delinquent\n| {{nts|4}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Duncan is a crafty juvenile delinquent and apparent bully who knows many tactics from his time spent in juvenile detention centers. His experience in juvy has made him into a strong and ruthless competitor, but he still shows affection towards his teammates from time to time, particularly towards Courtney. During the merge, he forms a guys alliance with DJ, Geoff, and Owen to help the men stay in the competition. He ends up being tough enough to make it to the final four.\n|-\n| {{va|Eva}}\n| [[Julia Chantrey]]\n| The Female Bully\n| {{nts|12}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Eva is very competitive and physically strong, but she is often overly aggressive. She is known to have a short temper and violent ways of exhibiting her anger. While her temper got her eliminated from the competition early, she was allowed to return to compete after the merge (which lasted one episode because the contestants still didn't want to deal with her violent behavior). Eva is one out of three contestants from the original cast to only compete on ''Total Drama Island'' and not on any of its follow-up seasons.\n|-\n| {{va|Ezekiel}}\n| [[Peter Oldring]]\n| The Home Schooled Guy\n| {{nts|22}}nd (Last)\n| align=\"left\"| Ezekiel is a na\u00efve country boy who was homeschooled at his farm. His lack of interaction with other kids has left him with incredibly poor social skills. He is the first one voted off the competition due to his unintentional sexist remarks towards the female competitors.\n|-\n| {{va|Geoff}}\n| [[Dan Petronijevic]]\n| The Funniest Guy Around\n| {{nts|6}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Geoff may not be the smartest contestant in the bunch, but he has a positive attitude, loves people, and is always up for a party. He forms a strong friendship with DJ and Duncan, and develops a crush on fellow surfer Bridgette. He tries to get closer to her, however, the relationship between the two is often a rocky one, as many of his attempts to impress her instead end up putting her off. As the season progresses, Bridgette shows signs of returning his feelings, and the two officially become a couple.\n|-\n| {{va|Gwen}}\n| [[Megan Fahlenbock]]\n| The Loner\n| {{ntsh|2}}Finalist\n| align=\"left\"| Gwen is a goth girl whose interests lie in art and astronomy. She is smart, independent, kind and level-headed, stating her best quality is her inability to get excited over minuscule things. Her attitude at first seems very harsh and sarcastic, but she is not a bitter person. During the season, she develops a crush on Trent and forms an intense rivalry with her teammate Heather. Despite the numerous physical and social obstacles in her way, Gwen is strong enough to make it to the finale alongside Owen.\n|-\n| {{va|Harold}}\n| [[Brian Froud (actor)|Brian Froud]]\n| The Dweeb\n| {{nts|13}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Harold is a skinny, awkward-looking guy who takes pride in his knowledge, resourcefulness, and \"Mad Skills\" in subjects like filming and beatboxing. He is frequently bullied by Duncan and is often underestimated by his teammates and competitors, as he's pulled through and won challenges for the Killer Bass a number of times despite nearly getting voted off at several elimination ceremonies. It's revealed later in the season that he's developed a large crush on Leshawna.\n|-\n| {{va|Heather}}\n| [[Rachel Wilson]]\n| The Queen Bee\n| {{nts|3}}rd\n| align=\"left\"| Heather competes with her sights solely on the prize money and not on making friends, using others at her advantage and only being kind when she may ultimately be benefited. Early in the season, she forms an alliance with Beth and Lindsay and frequently forces the latter to place Heather's priorities above her own. Despite everyone's hatred towards her (particularly from Gwen and Leshawna), she manages to make it to the final three thanks to either performing strongly in the competition or manipulating others to get what she wants.\n|-\n| {{va|Izzy}}\n| [[Katie Crown]]\n| The Psycho Hose Beast\n| {{nts|7}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Izzy is seen as one of the show's craziest contestants. She is fun but hard to handle and to the other contestants, more trouble than she is worth. Izzy has extraordinary athletic and fighting abilities, and also sticks herself to the wild environment. Early in the season, she is forced to leave the competition after being chased out by the Royal Canadian Mountain Police, but Chris allows her to return after the teams merge into one. During the merge, she develops a strong crush on Owen.\n|-\n| {{va|Justin}}\n| [[Adam Reid]]\n| The Eye Candy\n| {{nts|20}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Justin is a supermodel of incredible beauty. He is so handsome that he can make everyone around, whether they are female, male, or animal, stop dead in his or her tracks at the mere sight of him. While Justin does speak in the first and last episodes of the season, he remains mute for the majority of the time, letting his appearance speak for itself.\n|-\n| {{va|Katie}}\n| [[Stephanie Anne Mills]]\n| The Sweet Girl\n| {{nts|19}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Katie and Sadie are two best friends who do everything together. They are sensitive, cheerful, and boy-crazy and when they grow attracted to someone, they will fawn over him endlessly. After Katie's elimination, Sadie struggles at first to compete without her, but adapts more as she continues. They are two out of three contestants from the original cast to only compete on ''Total Drama Island'' and not any of its follow-up seasons.\n|-\n| {{va|Leshawna}}\n| Novie Edwards\n| The Sister With 'Tude\n| {{nts|5}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Leshawna is loyal and sassy, yet also can be affectionate and caring. If shown respect, she will reciprocate it indefinitely. Leshawna tells it like it is, and has no fear whatsoever of calling people out on their mistakes. She forms a friendship with Gwen and a strong rivalry against Heather.\n|-\n| {{va|Lindsay}}\n| [[Stephanie Anne Mills]]\n| The Dumb Princess\n| {{nts|9}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Lindsay is described as being beautiful, but not vain. While Lindsay is one of the prettiest competitors on the show and is spoilt silly by her father, she is known for having a very big heart inside of her very big chest, which leads to a result that she made friends with almost everyone. Her na\u00efveity also leads to results of her own downfalls often to her teammates, to her competitors and to herself. She forms an alliance with Heather early on in the season and is often forced by her to do various tasks to benefit Heather more than herself. She also begins one of the show's first romances with Tyler alongside having a crush on Trent which is what he is unaware of.\n|-\n| {{va|Noah}}\n| [[Carter Hayden]]\n| The Schemer\n| {{nts|21}}st\n| align=\"left\"| Noah comes off as being sarcastic, cynical, and a bit too lazy. He is extremely intelligent, growing up as a child prodigy, but finds physical activity as laughable as the ridiculous antics of some of his peers.\n|-\n| {{va|Owen}}\n| [[Scott McCord]]\n| The Party Guy\n| {{ntsh|1}}Finalist\n| align=\"left\"| Owen is a huggable, upbeat, fun-loving, friendly, passionate, and optimistic competitor, who is basically in ''Total Drama'' to have fun more than win the grand prize. Owen's three biggest loves are eating, having a good time and passing a large amount of gas. Among his peers, he is arguably the most popular contestant of all time for his cheerful ways, optimistic viewpoints no matter what the situation is, and ability to see the best in other people. Despite his obesity, he makes it to the finale with Gwen thanks to his popularity amongst the cast and surprising athletic abilities. He develops a crush on Izzy while they were walking through the woods in their horror movie survival challenge.\n|-\n| {{va|Sadie}}\n| Lauren Lipson\n| The Sweet Girl's Best Friend\n| {{nts|15}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Sadie and Katie are best friends who do everything together. They are sensitive, cheerful, and boy-crazy and when they are attracted to someone, they fawn over him endlessly. After Katie's elimination, Sadie struggles at first to compete without her, but adapts as she continues. They are two out of three contestants from the original cast to only compete on ''Total Drama Island'' and not any of its follow-up seasons.\n|-\n| {{va|Trent}}\n| [[Scott McCord]]\n| The Cool Guy\n| {{nts|11}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Trent is a relaxed, nice guy who tends to get along with everyone with his social skills and ability to play the guitar. He is also shown as being a pain magnet, suffering a number of near-death experiences and mishaps during the season. He has a crush on Gwen and when the two try to get together, Heather tries to break them apart seeing their affection as a threat towards her alliance.\n|-\n| {{va|Tyler}}\n| [[Peter Oldring]]\n| The Jock\n| {{nts|18}}th\n| align=\"left\"| Tyler is a sports fan who loves anything physical. Unfortunately, he is extremely uncoordinated and dim, constantly putting himself and others at risk with his clumsiness. He and Lindsay become one of the show's first couples.\n|-\n|}\n\n===Episode finale variations===\nFor every season, the show's producers create two alternate endings for the final episode, such that the winner seen in one country's broadcasts is the runner-up in other countries (and vice versa) where the show airs. Owen is the original winner in Canada, but he is also shown as the winner in Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latin America (Cartoon Network), the Middle East, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Portugal, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Gwen is

The plot concerns a New York City police officer and a homeless shelter manager who join forces to investigate a series of disappearances, and discover the missing are taken by humanoid monsters that live below the city. \n\nThe title of the movie stands for '''C'''annibalistic '''H'''umanoid '''U'''nderground '''D'''wellers.\n\nThe film was released in North America on August 31, 1984 and grossed $4.7 million. It was followed in 1989 by ''[[C.H.U.D. II: Bud the C.H.U.D.]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a woman, Flora Bosch, walking her dog down an empty, darkened city street. As she passes by a [[manhole]], a creature attacks Mrs. Bosch and drags her and the dog into the sewers.\n\nGeorge Cooper lives with his girlfriend Lauren. George, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone fame and fortune. His current project is photographing [[New York City|New York City's]] [[homeless]] population, specifically those known as \"undergrounders\", or people who reside within the bowels of the city.\n\nCaptain Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons being reported to his precinct, as Flora, his wife, remains missing. Bosch interviews A.J. \"The Reverend\" Shepherd, who runs the local homeless shelter. Shepherd believes recent events to be a part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it. Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from Wilson, who works for the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC).\n\nIt turns out that monsters are lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical [[toxic waste]] into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes to feed. Through a series of events, both George and A.J. find themselves trapped in the sewers, a reporter gets involved and eaten, and Lauren has a problem with both a clogged shower drain and a mutant that comes up through the sewer access point that she opened in the basement of her apartment building. A.J. and George, both discover that The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] is directly involved in the slaughter that has been going on.\n\nAlthough the political bureaucracy has forbidden the NRC to transport the toxic wastes through New York because of the large-scale danger to the public, it has secretly been hiding the waste by-products, marked as \"Contamination Hazard Urban Disposal\", beneath Manhattan in the abandoned subway tunnels. The underground homeless population has been coming into contact with these by-products, turning them into the mutated creatures. To protect this secret Wilson sends a man to disrupt A.J. from making phone calls to the press.  This thug then locks A.J. in an underground access tunnel either to suffocate from the gas to be used to [[asphyxiate]] the C.H.U.D.s, or to leave him to become their prey. Later that evening at a diner, two police officers enter and while the waitress and the two are discussing, the monsters return and attack the diner inhabitants.\n\nCaptain Bosch argues with Wilson over how to deal with the threat: Wilson wants to seal the sewers, open up some gas lines, and asphyxiate the C.H.U.D.s despite the inherent danger to the city.\n\nWilson, after being overwhelmed by Bosch, shoots him and drives the truck in reverse aiming for George and AJ, but they escape from the manhole just in time as Wilson passes them over. AJ finds Bosch's gun and shoots and kills Wilson before he hits them. The truck explodes as it falls on the manhole. Bosch is found to be alive and George, Lauren, and AJ are safe.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as George Cooper\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as A.J. \"The Reverend\" Shepherd\n* [[Christopher Curry (actor)|Christopher Curry]] as Captain Bosch\n* [[Kim Greist]] as Lauren Daniels\n* [[J.C.

Through a series of events, both George and A.J. find themselves trapped in the sewers, a reporter gets involved and eaten, and Lauren has a problem with both a clogged shower drain and a mutant that comes up through the sewer access point that she opened in the basement of her apartment building. A.J. and George, both discover that The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] is directly involved in the slaughter that has been going on.\n\nAlthough the political bureaucracy has forbidden the NRC to transport the toxic wastes through New York because of the large-scale danger to the public, it has secretly been hiding the waste by-products, marked as \"Contamination Hazard Urban Disposal\", beneath Manhattan in the abandoned subway tunnels. The underground homeless population has been coming into contact with these by-products, turning them into the mutated creatures. To protect this secret Wilson sends a man to disrupt A.J. from making phone calls to the press.  This thug then locks A.J. in an underground access tunnel either to suffocate from the gas to be used to [[asphyxiate]] the C.H.U.D.s, or to leave him to become their prey. Later that evening at a diner, two police officers enter and while the waitress and the two are discussing, the monsters return and attack the diner inhabitants.\n\nCaptain Bosch argues with Wilson over how to deal with the threat: Wilson wants to seal the sewers, open up some gas lines, and asphyxiate the C.H.U.D.s despite the inherent danger to the city.\n\nWilson, after being overwhelmed by Bosch, shoots him and drives the truck in reverse aiming for George and AJ, but they escape from the manhole just in time as Wilson passes them over. AJ finds Bosch's gun and shoots and kills Wilson before he hits them. The truck explodes as it falls on the manhole. Bosch is found to be alive and George, Lauren, and AJ are safe.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as George Cooper\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as A.J. \"The Reverend\" Shepherd\n* [[Christopher Curry (actor)|Christopher Curry]] as Captain Bosch\n* [[Kim Greist]] as Lauren Daniels\n* [[J.C.

Immediately after this, they follow him ([[Luke 5]]:4\u201311). The [[Gospel of John]] gives a comparable account of \"The First Disciples\" ([[John 1]]:35\u201342). In John, the readers are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" and then followed Jesus. Andrew then went to his brother Simon, saying, \"We have found the [[Messiah]]\", and then brought Simon to Jesus.\n\n[[File:Cavalier d'Arpino - Christ Taken Prisoner - WGA04690.jpg|thumb|right|Apostle Peter striking the [[High Priest]]s' servant [[Malchus]] with a sword in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], by [[Giuseppe Cesari]] c. 1597]]\n\nThree of the four gospels\u2014Matthew, Mark and John\u2014recount the story of Jesus [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]].

Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus threatened him with: \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me\", Peter replied: \"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head\" ([[John 13]]:2\u201311). The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].\n\nThe three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Matthew 26]]:51, [[Mark 14]]:47, [[Luke 22]]:50). The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim ([[John 18]]:10).

Peter features again in Galatians, fourteen years later, when Paul (now with [[Barnabas]] and [[Saint Titus|Titus]]) returned to Jerusalem ([[Galatians 2]]:7-9).

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:\n# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), \"the rooster crowed\". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was \"sitting\"; according to John, he was \"standing\".\n# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, \"the rooster crowed\". The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].\n# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, \"the rooster crowed\". Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual. John does not mention the Galilean accent.\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke is a record of Christ telling Peter: \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" In a reminiscent<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G. and Bruce M.

The Church of the Primacy of St. Peter on the [[Sea of Galilee]] is seen as the traditional site where Jesus Christ appeared to his disciples after his resurrection and, according to Catholic tradition, established Peter's supreme jurisdiction over the Christian church.\n\n===Leader of the early church===\n[[File:Liberation of Saint Peter by Giovanni Lanfranco-BMA.jpg|thumb|left|''The Liberation of St. Peter'' from prison by an angel, by [[Giovanni Lanfranco]], 1620\u201321]]\n\nPeter was considered along with James the Just and John the Apostle as pillars of the Church.<ref>Galatians 2:9</ref> Legitimised by Jesus' appearance, Peter assumed leadership of the group of early followers, forming the Jerusalem ''ekkl\u0113sia'' mentioned by Paul.{{sfn|Pagels|2005|p=45}}{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|p=116}} He was soon eclipsed in this leadership by James the Just, \"the Brother of the Lord.\"{{sfn|Pagels|2005|pp=45\u201346}}{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|pp=116\u2013117}} According to L\u00fcdemann, this was due to the discussions about the [[Paul and Judaism|strictness of adherence]] to the Jewish Law, when the more conservative faction of James the Just<ref>{{cite journal |title=James the Just in History and Tradition: Perspectives of Past and Present Scholarship (Part I) |journal=Currents in Research |volume=5 |pages=73\u2013122 |last=Myllykoski |first=Matti |publisher=Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies, Finland |quote=James the Just, the brother of Jesus, is known from the New Testament as the chief apostle of the Torah-obedient Christians.|doi=10.1177/1476993X06068700 |year=2006 }}</ref> took the overhand over the more liberal position of Peter, who soon lost influence.{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|pp=116\u2013117}}{{refn|group=note|At the [[Council of Jerusalem]] (c. 50), the early Church, Paul and the leaders of the Jerusalem church met and decided to embrace Gentile converts.

[[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: \"One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one.\"\n\nThis is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.\n\nBefore [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].\n\nIn the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:\n\n* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]\u2014This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]].\n* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]\u2014commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1\u201311}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].\n\n==Primacy of Peter==\nChristians of different theological backgrounds are in disagreement as to the exact significance of Peter's ministry. For instance: \n* Catholics view Peter as the first pope. The Catholic Church asserts that Peter's ministry, conferred upon him by Jesus of Nazareth in the gospels, lays down the theological foundation for the pope's exercise of pastoral authority over the Church.\n* Eastern Orthodox also believe that Peter's ministry points to an underlying theology wherein a special primacy ought to be granted to Peter's successors above other Church leaders but see this as merely a \"primacy of honor\", rather than the right to exercise pastoral authority.\n* Protestant denominations assert that Peter's apostolic work in Rome does not imply a connection between him and the papacy.\nSimilarly, historians of various backgrounds also offer differing interpretations of the Apostle's presence in Rome.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Papal primacy}}\n[[File:Statua di San Pietro realizzata da Giuseppe De Fabris - Piazza di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St. Peter in [[St. Peter's Square]] at the Vatican]]\n\nAccording to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|first place of honor and authority]]. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first [[Pope]]. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].<ref name=CEPope>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G.

Once the position was institutionalized, historians looked back and recognized Peter as the first pope of the Christian church in Rome\"</ref>\n\nThe Catholic Church's recognition of Peter as head of its church on earth (with Christ being its [[heaven]]ly head) is based on its interpretation of two passages from the [[canonical gospels]] of the [[New Testament]], as well as [[sacred tradition]].\n\n====John 21:15\u201317====\nThe first passage is {{Bibleref2|John|21:15\u201317}} which is: \"Feed my lambs...

He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html |title=Religion: Peter & the Rock |publisher=Time |date=1953-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> Cullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=\"Time\" />\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or \"this same\", when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of \"Rock\" by looking at the Aramaic language. While the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual, which is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today''|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In the New Testament|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.html|title=Some Thoughts on Matthew 16:18|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLutheran historians even report that the Catholic church itself didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the rock until the 1870s:\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director\", or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, {{ISBN|978-0-88141-125-6}})</ref> The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any \"princely\" role over his fellow Apostles.\n\nThe New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).\n\nEastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that \"Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (\"To the Romans\", Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.\"\n\nWith regard to Jesus' words to Peter, \"Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church\", the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church. This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says \"upon this rock\" (\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u1fb3); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.<ref>Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, {{ISBN|0-944359-13-2}}) p. 105</ref> This \"gender distinction\" argument is also held by some Protestants.\n\n===Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[File:Antonio de Bellis - La liberazione di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Saint Peter and the angel'', by [[Antonio de Bellis]] ]] \nThe Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to have been the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.\n\nThe Syriac Fathers, following the rabbinic tradition, call Jesus \"Kepha\" for they see \"rock\" in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer to Saint Peter as \"Saint Simon the Generous\" or Simon Karam\"). When Christ gave his own name \"Kepha\" to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else's name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He wrote: \"Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations.\"\n\nAgain he wrote in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from \"rock\" (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. God accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him Kepha. When he speaks about the transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church. Ephrem also shared the same view. The Armenian version of [[De Virginitate]] records that [[Peter the rock]] shunned honour. A ''mimro'' of Efrem found in Holy Week Liturgy points to the importance of Peter.\n\nBoth [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] represent the authentic tradition of the Syrian Church. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of Church buildings, marriage, ordination, ''et cetera'', reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of living faith of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/Articles/PrimacyofStPeter.htm |title=\"Primacy of St. Peter\" \u2013 by Dr. Thomas Athanasius |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\n===New Apostolic Church===\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]], which believes in the re-established Apostle ministry, sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]].\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n[[File:Saint Peter by Gr\u00e3o Vasco.jpg|thumb|''Saint Peter'' by [[Gr\u00e3o Vasco|Vasco Fernandes]], 1506]]\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that Peter was the first leader of the early Christian church after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language. The textual features of these two epistles are such that a majority of scholars doubt that they were written by the same hand. Some scholars argue that theological differences imply different sources, and point to the lack of references to 2&nbsp;Peter among the early Church Fathers.\n\n[[Daniel B. Wallace]] (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for many scholars, \"the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter\" and that \"the vast bulk of NT scholars adopts this perspective without much discussion\". However, he later states, \"Although a very strong case has been made against Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, we believe it is deficient. ...Taken together, these external and internal arguments strongly suggest the traditional view, viz., that Peter was indeed the author of the second epistle which bears his name.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031209164253/http://www.bible.org/docs/soapbox/2petotl.htm ''Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline'']. Archive date: 9 December 2003. Access date: 19 August 2013.</ref>\n\nOf the two epistles, the [[First Epistle of Peter|first epistle]] is considered the earlier. A number of scholars have argued that the textual discrepancies with what would be expected of the biblical Peter are due to it having been written with the help of a secretary or as an [[amanuensis]].<ref name=\"ce-epistles\">{{cathEncy|wstitle=Epistles of St. Peter|volume=11|author=Vander Heeren, Achille}}</ref>\n\n[[Jerome]] explains:\n\n{{quote|The two Epistles attributed to St. Peter differ in style, character, and the construction of the words, which proves that according to the exigencies of the moment St. Peter made use of different interpreters.

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example Eusebius of Caesarea (''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in First Peter must be this Neronian persecution.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that First Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81\u201396), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:\n\n{{quote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1\u20132}}}}\n\nThose scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1\u20132.\n \nThe [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied Second Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and Second Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150; there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian Eusebius wrote that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 25|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nJerome says that Peter \"wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him\"''(De Viris Illustribus 1).''<ref>{{cite web|last1=saint|first1=Jerome|title=De Viris Illustribus (On Illustrious Men) Chapter 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> But he himself received the epistle, and explained the difference in style, character, and structure of words by the assumption that Peter used different interpreters in the composition of the two epistles;<ref name=\"Jerome\" /> and from his time onward the epistle was generally regarded as a part of the New Testament.\n\nEven in early times there was controversy over its authorship, and Second Peter was often not included in the [[biblical canon]]; it was only in the 4th century that it gained a firm foothold in the New Testament, in a series of synods.

According to Eusebius' ''Ecclesiastical History'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:\n\n{{quote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered.

It is unclear whether the fragment is an abridged version of the accounts in the [[synoptic gospels]], or a source text on which they were based, perhaps the apocryphal Gospel of Peter.<ref>''Das Evangelium nach Petrus.

He thus contrasts with [[Paul the Apostle]] who is bald except at the sides, with a longer beard and often black hair, and thinner in the face. One exception to this is in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], where he typically lacks a beard. Both Peter and Paul are shown thus as early as the 4th century [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]] in Rome.<ref>Higgitt, John, \"The Iconography of Saint Peter in Anglo-Saxon England, and Saint Cuthbert's Coffin\", pp. 267\u2013272, 270 quoted, in: Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David & Stancliffe, Clare, eds., ''St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200''.

By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons.\n\nThe depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists, is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God. Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers. Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial. In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Repentance.\n\n==Patronage==\n<!-- This section is linked from the Christian leader infobox at top -->\n[[File:Peter in Chora.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Medieval mosaic of Saint Peter in the [[Chora Church]], Istanbul]]\n[[File:Ancient icon of sts peter & paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Icon of Saint Peter and Paul]]\n[[File:Llanbeblig Hours (f. 2v.)

Some Protestants, however, have rejected Peter's martyrdom as a later invention, arguing that evidence of Peter exists only in biblical accounts and not in the [[history]].\n\nIt has also been suggested that there was a serious division between Peter's [[Jewish Christian]] party and Paul's Hellenizing party, seen in e.g. the [[Incident at Antioch]], which later Christian accounts have downplayed.<ref>White, L. Michael (2004). ''From Jesus to Christianity''. Harper SanFrancisco. p. 170. {{ISBN|0-06-052655-6}}.</ref>\n\nAnother revisionist view was developed by supporters of the [[Christ myth theory]], which holds that the figure of Peter is largely a development from some mythological doorkeeper figures. According to [[Arthur Drews]] and [[George Albert Wells|G. A.

Jesus then amazes Simon and his companions James and John (Andrew is not mentioned) by telling them to lower their nets, whereupon they catch a huge number of fish. Immediately after this, they follow him ([[Luke 5]]:4\u201311). The [[Gospel of John]] gives a comparable account of \"The First Disciples\" ([[John 1]]:35\u201342). In John, the readers are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" and then followed Jesus. Andrew then went to his brother Simon, saying, \"We have found the [[Messiah]]\", and then brought Simon to Jesus.\n\n[[File:Cavalier d'Arpino - Christ Taken Prisoner - WGA04690.jpg|thumb|right|Apostle Peter striking the [[High Priest]]s' servant [[Malchus]] with a sword in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], by [[Giuseppe Cesari]] c. 1597]]\n\nThree of the four gospels\u2014Matthew, Mark and John\u2014recount the story of Jesus [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]].

Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus threatened him with: \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me\", Peter replied: \"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head\" ([[John 13]]:2\u201311). The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].\n\nThe three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Matthew 26]]:51, [[Mark 14]]:47, [[Luke 22]]:50). The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim ([[John 18]]:10). Luke adds that Jesus touched the ear and miraculously healed it ([[Luke 22]]:49\u201351). This healing of the servant's ear is the last of the [[Miracles of Jesus|37 miracles attributed to Jesus]] in the Bible.\n\nSimon Peter was twice arraigned, with John, before the [[Sanhedrin]] and directly defied them ([[Acts 4]]:7\u201322, [[Acts 5]]:18\u201342). After receiving a vision from [[God]] that allowed for the eating of previously unclean animals, Peter takes a missionary journey to [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] ([[Acts 9]]:32\u2013[[Acts 10]]:2), becoming instrumental in the decision to evangelise the [[Gentile]]s ([[Acts 10]]).

Peter features again in Galatians, fourteen years later, when Paul (now with [[Barnabas]] and [[Saint Titus|Titus]]) returned to Jerusalem ([[Galatians 2]]:7-9).

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:\n# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), \"the rooster crowed\". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was \"sitting\"; according to John, he was \"standing\".\n# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, \"the rooster crowed\". The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].\n# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, \"the rooster crowed\". Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual. John does not mention the Galilean accent.\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke is a record of Christ telling Peter: \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" In a reminiscent<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G. and Bruce M.

After seeing the graveclothes he goes home, apparently without informing the other disciples.{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|24:1\u201312}}\n\nIn the [[John 21|final chapter]] of the Gospel of John, Peter, in one of the resurrection appearances of Jesus, [[Restoration of Peter|three times affirmed his love for Jesus]], balancing his threefold denial, and Jesus reconfirmed Peter's position. The Church of the Primacy of St. Peter on the [[Sea of Galilee]] is seen as the traditional site where Jesus Christ appeared to his disciples after his resurrection and, according to Catholic tradition, established Peter's supreme jurisdiction over the Christian church.\n\n===Leader of the early church===\n[[File:Liberation of Saint Peter by Giovanni Lanfranco-BMA.jpg|thumb|left|''The Liberation of St. Peter'' from prison by an angel, by [[Giovanni Lanfranco]], 1620\u201321]]\n\nPeter was considered along with James the Just and John the Apostle as pillars of the Church.<ref>Galatians 2:9</ref> Legitimised by Jesus' appearance, Peter assumed leadership of the group of early followers, forming the Jerusalem ''ekkl\u0113sia'' mentioned by Paul.{{sfn|Pagels|2005|p=45}}{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|p=116}} He was soon eclipsed in this leadership by James the Just, \"the Brother of the Lord.\"{{sfn|Pagels|2005|pp=45\u201346}}{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|pp=116\u2013117}} According to L\u00fcdemann, this was due to the discussions about the [[Paul and Judaism|strictness of adherence]] to the Jewish Law, when the more conservative faction of James the Just<ref>{{cite journal |title=James the Just in History and Tradition: Perspectives of Past and Present Scholarship (Part I) |journal=Currents in Research |volume=5 |pages=73\u2013122 |last=Myllykoski |first=Matti |publisher=Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies, Finland |quote=James the Just, the brother of Jesus, is known from the New Testament as the chief apostle of the Torah-obedient Christians.|doi=10.1177/1476993X06068700 |year=2006 }}</ref> took the overhand over the more liberal position of Peter, who soon lost influence.{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|pp=116\u2013117}}{{refn|group=note|At the [[Council of Jerusalem]] (c. 50), the early Church, Paul and the leaders of the Jerusalem church met and decided to embrace Gentile converts.

Harrington]], who suggests that Peter was an unlikely symbol of stability. While he was one of the first disciples called and was the spokesman for the group, Peter is also the exemplar of \"little faith\". In {{Bibleref2|Matthew|14}}, Peter will soon have Jesus say to him, \"O you of little faith, why did you doubt?\", and he will eventually deny Jesus three times.

This \"dies imperii\" (regnal day anniversary) was an important one, exactly ten years after Nero ascended to the throne, and it was \"as usual\" accompanied by much bloodshed. Traditionally, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities sentenced him to death by [[crucifixion]].

[[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: \"One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one.\"\n\nThis is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.\n\nBefore [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].\n\nIn the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:\n\n* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]\u2014This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]].\n* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]\u2014commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1\u201311}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].\n\n==Primacy of Peter==\nChristians of different theological backgrounds are in disagreement as to the exact significance of Peter's ministry. For instance: \n* Catholics view Peter as the first pope. The Catholic Church asserts that Peter's ministry, conferred upon him by Jesus of Nazareth in the gospels, lays down the theological foundation for the pope's exercise of pastoral authority over the Church.\n* Eastern Orthodox also believe that Peter's ministry points to an underlying theology wherein a special primacy ought to be granted to Peter's successors above other Church leaders but see this as merely a \"primacy of honor\", rather than the right to exercise pastoral authority.\n* Protestant denominations assert that Peter's apostolic work in Rome does not imply a connection between him and the papacy.\nSimilarly, historians of various backgrounds also offer differing interpretations of the Apostle's presence in Rome.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Papal primacy}}\n[[File:Statua di San Pietro realizzata da Giuseppe De Fabris - Piazza di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St. Peter in [[St. Peter's Square]] at the Vatican]]\n\nAccording to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|first place of honor and authority]]. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first [[Pope]]. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].<ref name=CEPope>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G.

He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html |title=Religion: Peter & the Rock |publisher=Time |date=1953-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> Cullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=\"Time\" />\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or \"this same\", when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of \"Rock\" by looking at the Aramaic language. While the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual, which is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today''|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In the New Testament|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.html|title=Some Thoughts on Matthew 16:18|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLutheran historians even report that the Catholic church itself didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the rock until the 1870s:\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director\", or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, {{ISBN|978-0-88141-125-6}})</ref> The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any \"princely\" role over his fellow Apostles.\n\nThe New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).\n\nEastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that \"Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (\"To the Romans\", Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.\"\n\nWith regard to Jesus' words to Peter, \"Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church\", the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church. This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says \"upon this rock\" (\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u1fb3); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.<ref>Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, {{ISBN|0-944359-13-2}}) p. 105</ref> This \"gender distinction\" argument is also held by some Protestants.\n\n===Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[File:Antonio de Bellis - La liberazione di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Saint Peter and the angel'', by [[Antonio de Bellis]] ]] \nThe Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to have been the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.\n\nThe Syriac Fathers, following the rabbinic tradition, call Jesus \"Kepha\" for they see \"rock\" in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer to Saint Peter as \"Saint Simon the Generous\" or Simon Karam\"). When Christ gave his own name \"Kepha\" to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else's name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He wrote: \"Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations.\"\n\nAgain he wrote in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from \"rock\" (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. God accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him Kepha. When he speaks about the transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church. Ephrem also shared the same view. The Armenian version of [[De Virginitate]] records that [[Peter the rock]] shunned honour. A ''mimro'' of Efrem found in Holy Week Liturgy points to the importance of Peter.\n\nBoth [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] represent the authentic tradition of the Syrian Church. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of Church buildings, marriage, ordination, ''et cetera'', reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of living faith of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/Articles/PrimacyofStPeter.htm |title=\"Primacy of St. Peter\" \u2013 by Dr. Thomas Athanasius |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\n===New Apostolic Church===\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]], which believes in the re-established Apostle ministry, sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]].\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n[[File:Saint Peter by Gr\u00e3o Vasco.jpg|thumb|''Saint Peter'' by [[Gr\u00e3o Vasco|Vasco Fernandes]], 1506]]\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that Peter was the first leader of the early Christian church after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language. The textual features of these two epistles are such that a majority of scholars doubt that they were written by the same hand. Some scholars argue that theological differences imply different sources, and point to the lack of references to 2&nbsp;Peter among the early Church Fathers.\n\n[[Daniel B. Wallace]] (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for many scholars, \"the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter\" and that \"the vast bulk of NT scholars adopts this perspective without much discussion\". However, he later states, \"Although a very strong case has been made against Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, we believe it is deficient. ...Taken together, these external and internal arguments strongly suggest the traditional view, viz., that Peter was indeed the author of the second epistle which bears his name.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031209164253/http://www.bible.org/docs/soapbox/2petotl.htm ''Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline''].

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example Eusebius of Caesarea (''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in First Peter must be this Neronian persecution.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that First Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81\u201396), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:\n\n{{quote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1\u20132}}}}\n\nThose scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1\u20132.\n \nThe [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied Second Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and Second Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150; there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian Eusebius wrote that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 25|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nJerome says that Peter \"wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him\"''(De Viris Illustribus 1).''<ref>{{cite web|last1=saint|first1=Jerome|title=De Viris Illustribus (On Illustrious Men) Chapter 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> But he himself received the epistle, and explained the difference in style, character, and structure of words by the assumption that Peter used different interpreters in the composition of the two epistles;<ref name=\"Jerome\" /> and from his time onward the epistle was generally regarded as a part of the New Testament.\n\nEven in early times there was controversy over its authorship, and Second Peter was often not included in the [[biblical canon]]; it was only in the 4th century that it gained a firm foothold in the New Testament, in a series of synods. In the East the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] still did not admit it into the canon until the 6th century.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n====Mark====\nTraditionally, the [[Gospel of Mark#Authorship and sources|Gospel of Mark]] was said to have been written by a person named [[John Mark]], and that this person was an assistant to Peter, hence its content was traditionally seen as the closest to Peter's viewpoint. According to Eusebius' ''|Ecclesiastical History'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:\n\n{{quote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a normal or chronological narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictional into the statements<ref>Eusebius,'' Ecclesiastical History'', 3.39.14\u201316</ref>}}\n\nClement of Alexandria in the fragments of his work ''Hypotyposes (A.D. 190)'' preserved and cited by the historian Eusebius in his Church History (VI, 14: 6) writes that:\n\n{{quote|As Peter had preached the Word publicly at Rome, and declared the Gospel by the Spirit, many who were present requested that [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], who had followed him for a long time and remembered his sayings, should write them out. And having composed the Gospel he gave it to those who had requested it.<ref name=\"CL\" />}}\n\nAlso Irenaeus wrote about this tradition:\n\n{{quote|After their (Peter and Paul's) passing, Mark also, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, transmitted to us in writing the things preached by Peter.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III. 1.2.; quoted by Eusebius in ''Ecclesiastical History'', book 5, 7.6</ref>}}\n\nBased on these quotes, and on the Christian tradition, the information in Mark's gospel about Peter would be based on eyewitness material.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> The gospel itself is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]], and the above passages are the oldest surviving written testimony to its authorship.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n===Pseudepigrapha and apocrypha===\n[[File:Muenster-100725-15996-\u00dcberwasserkirche-Schl\u00fcssel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|The [[Key (lock)|key]] as symbol of St. Peter]]\nThere are also a number of other [[apocrypha]]l writings, that have been either attributed to or written about Peter.

The account is similar to that of the canonical gospels, especially the [[Gospel of Mark]]. It is unclear whether the fragment is an abridged version of the accounts in the [[synoptic gospels]], or a source text on which they were based, perhaps the apocryphal Gospel of Peter.<ref>''Das Evangelium nach Petrus.

He thus contrasts with [[Paul the Apostle]] who is bald except at the sides, with a longer beard and often black hair, and thinner in the face. One exception to this is in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], where he typically lacks a beard. Both Peter and Paul are shown thus as early as the 4th century [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]] in Rome.<ref>Higgitt, John, \"The Iconography of Saint Peter in Anglo-Saxon England, and Saint Cuthbert's Coffin\", pp. 267\u2013272, 270 quoted, in: Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David & Stancliffe, Clare, eds., ''St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200''.

By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons.\n\nThe depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists, is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God. Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers. Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial. In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Repentance.\n\n==Patronage==\n<!-- This section is linked from the Christian leader infobox at top -->\n[[File:Peter in Chora.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Medieval mosaic of Saint Peter in the [[Chora Church]], Istanbul]]\n[[File:Ancient icon of sts peter & paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Icon of Saint Peter and Paul]]\n[[File:Llanbeblig Hours (f. 2v.)

During the [[War of 1812]] she made several extended length cruises in company with her [[sister ship]] {{USS|President|1800|2}} and captured, or assisted in the capture of twenty British merchant ships. At the end of 1813, due to a lack of materials to repair her, she was placed [[Reserve fleet|in ordinary]] for the remainder of the war. In 1815 she returned to service for the [[Second Barbary War]] and made patrols through 1816. In the 1820s she helped suppress piracy in the West Indies, made several voyages to South America, and was the first U.S. warship to visit China.

The design called for a diagonal [[scantling]] (rib) scheme intended to restrict [[hogging and sagging|hogging]] while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This design gave the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate.

On the 31st of that month, both ships began to pursue {{HMS|Galatea|1810|6}}, which was escorting two merchant ships. ''Galatea'' and her charges were chased for about three hours, during which ''Congress'' captured the merchant ship ''Argo''. In the meantime, ''President'' kept after ''Galatea'' but lost sight of her as darkness fell. ''Congress'' and ''President'' remained together during November but they did not find a single ship to capture. On their return to the United States they passed north of Bermuda, proceeded towards the [[Virginia capes]], and arrived back in Boston on 31 December.

''Congress'' parted company with ''President'' on the 8th and patrolled off the [[Cape Verde Islands]] and the coast of Brazil. She only captured four small British merchant ships during this period and returned to the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]] for repairs in late 1813. By this time of the war, materials and personnel were being diverted to the [[Great Lakes]], which created a shortage of resources necessary to repair her. Due to the amount of repairs she needed, it was decided instead to place her in ordinary, where she stayed for the remainder of the war.<ref name=\"Toll419420\">Toll (2006), pp. 419\u2013420.</ref><ref name=\"Teddy174175\">Roosevelt (1883), pp. 174\u2013175.</ref><ref name=\"MacSmith521\">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 521.</ref>\n\nLouis F.

During the [[War of 1812]] she made several extended length cruises in company with her [[sister ship]] {{USS|President|1800|2}} and captured, or assisted in the capture of twenty British merchant ships.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education == \nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> In addition to Hope, Davis was influenced by Morehouse professors [[Samuel Archer]] and [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]].<ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\"/> Davis attended Morehouse during the ongoing [[Atlanta compromise]] debate between [[Booker T.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education == \nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> In addition to Hope, Davis was influenced by Morehouse professors [[Samuel Archer]] and [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]].<ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\"/> Davis attended Morehouse during the ongoing [[Atlanta compromise]] debate between [[Booker T.
