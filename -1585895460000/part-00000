Thus, at below a pH of 6, the imidazole ring is mostly [[Protonation|protonated]] (as described by the [[Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation]]).  The resulting imidazolium ring bears two NH bonds and has a positive charge. The positive charge is equally distributed between both [[nitrogen]]s and can be represented with two equally important [[resonance structure]]s.  Above pH 6, one of the two protons is lost.  The remaining proton of the imidazole ring can reside on either nitrogen, giving rise to what are known as the N1-H or N3-H [[tautomer]]s.  The N3-H tautomer, shown in the figure above, is protonated on the #3 nitrogen, farther from the amino acid backbone bearing the amino and carboxyl groups, whereas the N1-H tautomer is protonated on the nitrogen nearer the backbone. The imidazole/imidazolium ring of histidine is [[aromatic]] at all pH values.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-2860(03)00282-5 |title=Five-membered heterocycles. Part III.

In a histidine [[proton shuttle]], histidine is used to quickly shuttle protons. It can do this by abstracting a proton with its basic nitrogen to make a positively charged intermediate and then use another molecule, a buffer, to extract the proton from its acidic nitrogen. In [[carbonic anhydrase]]s, a histidine proton shuttle is utilized to rapidly shuttle protons away from a [[zinc]]-bound water molecule to quickly regenerate the active form of the enzyme. In helices E and F of [[haemoglobin]], histidine influences binding of dioxygen as well as [[carbon monoxide]].  This interaction enhances the affinity of Fe(II) for O2 but destabilizes the binding of CO, which binds only 200 times stronger in haemoglobin, compared to 20,000 times stronger in free [[haem]].\n\nThe tautomerism and acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain has been characterized by <sup>15</sup>N NMR spectroscopy. The two 14N chemical shifts are similar (about 200 ppm, relative to [[nitric acid]] on the sigma scale, on which increased shielding corresponds to increased [[chemical shift]]).  [[NMR]] spectral measurements shows that the chemical shift of N1-H drops slightly, whereas the chemical shift of N3-H drops considerably (about 190 vs. 145 ppm).  This change indicates that the N1-H tautomer is preferred, possibly due to hydrogen bonding to the neighboring [[ammonium]].  The shielding at N3 is substantially reduced due to the second-order [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] effect, which involves a symmetry-allowed interaction between the nitrogen lone pair and the excited \u03c0* states of the [[aromatic ring]].  At pH > 9, the chemical shifts of N1 and N3 are approximately 185 and 170 ppm.<ref>{{cite book|title=ABCs of FT-NMR|last=Roberts|first=John D.|publisher=University Science Books|year=2000|isbn=978-1-891389-18-4|location=Sausalito, CA|pages=258\u20139}}</ref>\n\n===Ligand===\n[[Image:Succinate Dehygrogenase 1YQ3 Haem group.png|thumb|left|The histidine-bound [[heme]] group of [[succinate dehydrogenase]], an [[electron carrier]] in the [[mitochondria]]l [[electron transfer chain]].

Histidine synthesis in ''E. coli'' involves eight gene products (His1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and it occurs in ten steps. This is possible because a single gene product has the ability to catalyze more than one reaction.

Thus, at below a pH of 6, the imidazole ring is mostly [[Protonation|protonated]] (as described by the [[Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation]]).  The resulting imidazolium ring bears two NH bonds and has a positive charge. The positive charge is equally distributed between both [[nitrogen]]s and can be represented with two equally important [[resonance structure]]s.  Above pH 6, one of the two protons is lost.  The remaining proton of the imidazole ring can reside on either nitrogen, giving rise to what are known as the N1-H or N3-H [[tautomer]]s.  The N3-H tautomer, shown in the figure above, is protonated on the #3 nitrogen, farther from the amino acid backbone bearing the amino and carboxyl groups, whereas the N1-H tautomer is protonated on the nitrogen nearer the backbone. The imidazole/imidazolium ring of histidine is [[aromatic]] at all pH values.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-2860(03)00282-5 |title=Five-membered heterocycles. Part III.

In a histidine [[proton shuttle]], histidine is used to quickly shuttle protons. It can do this by abstracting a proton with its basic nitrogen to make a positively charged intermediate and then use another molecule, a buffer, to extract the proton from its acidic nitrogen. In [[carbonic anhydrase]]s, a histidine proton shuttle is utilized to rapidly shuttle protons away from a [[zinc]]-bound water molecule to quickly regenerate the active form of the enzyme. In helices E and F of [[haemoglobin]], histidine influences binding of dioxygen as well as [[carbon monoxide]].  This interaction enhances the affinity of Fe(II) for O2 but destabilizes the binding of CO, which binds only 200 times stronger in haemoglobin, compared to 20,000 times stronger in free [[haem]].\n\nThe tautomerism and acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain has been characterized by <sup>15</sup>N NMR spectroscopy. The two 14N chemical shifts are similar (about 200 ppm, relative to [[nitric acid]] on the sigma scale, on which increased shielding corresponds to increased [[chemical shift]]).  [[NMR]] spectral measurements shows that the chemical shift of N1-H drops slightly, whereas the chemical shift of N3-H drops considerably (about 190 vs. 145 ppm).  This change indicates that the N1-H tautomer is preferred, possibly due to hydrogen bonding to the neighboring [[ammonium]].  The shielding at N3 is substantially reduced due to the second-order [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] effect, which involves a symmetry-allowed interaction between the nitrogen lone pair and the excited \u03c0* states of the [[aromatic ring]].  At pH > 9, the chemical shifts of N1 and N3 are approximately 185 and 170 ppm.<ref>{{cite book|title=ABCs of FT-NMR|last=Roberts|first=John D.|publisher=University Science Books|year=2000|isbn=978-1-891389-18-4|location=Sausalito, CA|pages=258\u20139}}</ref>\n\n===Ligand===\n[[Image:Succinate Dehygrogenase 1YQ3 Haem group.png|thumb|left|The histidine-bound [[heme]] group of [[succinate dehydrogenase]], an [[electron carrier]] in the [[mitochondria]]l [[electron transfer chain]].

It was the last military [[biplane]] procured by the [[United States Navy]]. Delivered in 1937, it became obsolete even before [[World War II]] and was kept well away from combat with [[Axis powers|Axis]] fighters.<ref name=\"The Hamlyn Guide to Military Aircraft Markings\">Wheeler 1992, p. 27.</ref>\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Development==\nThere was controversy in the [[United States Navy|United States Navy's]] [[Bureau of Aeronautics|Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer)]] in the early 1930s regarding two-seat fighter planes, monoplanes and the retractable undercarriage<ref>Flanagan, Major William A. [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1981/may-jun/flanagan.htm#flanagan] ''The Fighter Force, How many seats'', Air University Review, May\u2013June 1981.</ref> In 1931, the Navy issued Design Specification No. 113, which detailed a requirement for a high-performance fighter with fixed undercarriage to be powered by the [[Wright Whirlwind|Wright R-1510]]<ref name=\"Gunston p 199\">Gunston p 199</ref> or [[Pratt & Whitney R-1535 Twin Wasp Junior|Pratt & Whitney's R-1535]] [[radial engine]].<ref>Gunston p 130</ref> Seven companies submitted proposals and two companies, the [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas Aircraft]] with their [[Douglas XFD|XFD-1]]<ref>Francillon pp 138\u2013140</ref> and the [[Vought|Chance Vought]] with their [[Vought XF3U|XF3U-1]]<ref>Moran p 59</ref> were given contracts for one prototype each. Both of these aircraft were two-seat biplanes. The Navy then asked Curtiss to supply a prototype of a two-seat monoplane which was technically more advanced.\n\nOn 30 June 1932, BuAer signed a contract with Curtiss to design a two-seat monoplane with a parasol wing a retractable undercarriage and powered by a 625&nbsp;hp (466&nbsp;kW) [[Wright Whirlwind|Wright R-1510-92]] fourteen cylinder, two row, air-cooled radial engine driving a two-blade propeller. This fighter was designated XF12C-1.\n\n==Design==\nThe SBC was an all-metal, two-seat scout-bomber biplane with \u201cI\u201d-type interplane struts. It was the last combat [[biplane]] the Navy purchased and the last combat biplane manufactured in the United States. The two crewmen, pilot and radio operator/gunner, were housed in tandem cockpits enclosed by a sliding canopy and the turtledeck behind the rear cockpit could be folded down to allow the gunner to use his machine gun. The wings, rudder, elevators and flaps were fabric covered. The main landing gear retracted into wheel wells in the fuselage just forward of the lower wing and the tail wheel retracted into the fuselage.<ref>Taylor p 111</ref>\n\n===XF12C-1 (Curtiss Model 73)===\n[[File:Curtiss XF12C-1.jpg|thumb|right|The XF12C-1]]\n\nThis aircraft was initially powered by a Wright R-1510-92 engine but this was unsuitable so the aircraft was re-engined with a 775&nbsp;hp (578&nbsp;kW) [[Wright Whirlwind|Wright R-1670]] fourteen cylinder, two row, air-cooled radial engine, which was also unsatisfactory. Both of these engines were prototypes and neither went into production. Finally, the 700&nbsp;hp (522&nbsp;kW) [[Wright R-1820|Wright R-1820-80]] nine cylinder, single row, air-cooled radial engine<ref name=\"Gunston p 199\"/> was installed and the resulting aircraft, designated XF12C-1 flew in 1933. Designed for aircraft carrier usage, the parasol wing folded back, a new feature for the Navy, for storage and the aircraft had an exposed tail hook for carrier landings. The first flight was in July 1933 but in September 1934, the parasol wing failed in the dive bomber tests.<ref>Swanborough p 162</ref>\n\n===XS4C-1 (Curtiss Model 73)===\n\nAfter testing the XF12C-1 was rejected as a fighter, and on 7 December 1933 this aircraft was redesignated in the scout category as the XS4C-1 and re-engined with a 700&nbsp;hp (522&nbsp;kW) Wright R-1820-80 radial engine<ref>Jane pp88d-92d</ref> driving a two-blade propeller. In its role as a scouting aircraft, bombing equipment for a 500-pound (227-kilogram) bomb had to be designed and provided.\n\n===XSBC-1 (Curtiss Model 73)===\n\nIn January 1934 the designation scout bomber (SB) was introduced and the aircraft was finally redesignated XSBC-1. In early 1934 flight tests, especially dive-bombing, began. On 14 June 1934 this aircraft crashed- attributed to wing failure- in [[Lancaster, New York]], about 6&nbsp;mi (9.66&nbsp;km) from the Curtiss plant, during one of the tests and it was destroyed.\n\n===XSBC-2 (Curtiss Model 77)===\n\nCurtiss-Wright made a proposal to the Navy to build one replacement aircraft that would be a staggered wing biplane, would not have folding wings but would have leading edge slots and the lower wing would have full span flaps. It was an all-metal aircraft with fabric covered control surfaces. It was powered by a 700&nbsp;hp (522&nbsp;kW) Wright XR-1510-12 fourteen-cylinder, twin-row, air-cooled engine driving a constant speed Curtiss Electric three-blade propeller, an enlarged canopy, enlarged vertical fin and rudder and retractable tail hook. The XSBC-2 had to engage in competitive tests against the Great Lakes Aircraft's XB2G-1<ref>Johnson pp 37\u201339</ref> and the Grumman Aircraft Engineering's XSBF-1.<ref>Johnson pp 39\u201341</ref> The XSBC-2 won and a contract for this aircraft was signed in April 1935 and it made its first flight on 9 December 1935.\n\n===XSBC-3 (Curtiss Model 77)===\n\nThe Wright XR-1510-12 engine in the XSBC-2 proved to be mechanically unreliable. In March 1936, this aircraft was re-engined with a 700&nbsp;hp (522&nbsp;kW) Pratt & Whitney R-1535-82 fourteen-cylinder, twin-row, air-cooled engine driving a three-blade propeller and redesignated XSBC-3. With this new configuration, the Navy placed a production order.\n\n===SBC-3 (Curtiss Model 77A)===\n[[File:SBC-3 Helldiver VS-3 in flight c1939.jpeg|thumb|The VS-3 CO's SBC-3, assigned to {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3}}, circa 1939.]]\n\nThe major difference between the prototype XSBC-3 and the production aircraft was the engine. A contract for 83 aircraft was signed in August 1936 and deliveries began on 17 July 1937. The production aircraft were powered by an 825&nbsp;hp (615&nbsp;kW) Pratt & Whitney R-1535-94 fourteen-cylinder, twin-row, air-cooled engine driving a three-blade propeller. Armament consisted of two 0.30-caliber (7.62&nbsp;mm) machine guns, one fixed gun in the right side of the fuselage forward of the pilot and a flexible gun in the rear cockpit. The aircraft had a bomb displacement swing located on the centerline of the fuselage for a 500-lb (227-kg) bomb or a 45-U.S.-gallon (170-liter) fuel tank.\n\n===XSBC-4 (Curtiss Model 77B)===\n\nThe 76th SBC-3 was re-engined with a 950-hp (708&nbsp;kW) Wright R-1820-22 nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled radial engine driving a three-blade Hamilton Standard propeller and redesignated XSBC-4. The aircraft armament increased to one 0.50-caliber (12.7-mm) fixed machine gun in the right side of the fuselage forward of the pilot and a 0.30-caliber (7.62-mm) flexible machine gun in the rear cockpit. With the more powerful engine, this aircraft could carry a 1,000-lb (454-kg) bomb on the bomb displacement swing located on the centerline of the fuselage. A second SBC-3 was redesignated XSBC-4 and used for test work.\n\n===SBC-4 (Curtiss Model 77B)===\n\nThe contract for 124 production aircraft of the XSBC-4 was signed on 5 January 1938 and deliveries began in March 1939 to April 1941.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===U.S. Navy===\n\nIn August 1936, the Navy signed a contract for 83 SBC-3s (Curtiss Model 77A). Delivery of the SBC-3s to the fleet began on 17 July 1937 when the first aircraft were issued to Scouting Squadron Five (VS-5) serving in [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|USS ''Yorktown'' (CV-5)]] however, ''Yorktown'' was not commissioned until 30 September 1937 and the ship then began sea trials. On 10 December 1937, VS-5 went aboard ''Yorktown'' and served aboard her until replaced by [[Douglas SBD Dauntless|Douglas SBD-3s Dauntlesses]] in 1940.\n\nBy June 1938, three of the five scouting squadrons serving in aircraft carriers were equipped with SBC-3s while the other two were equipped with [[Vought SBU Corsair|Vought SBU-1s]]. The three ships with SBC-3s were:\n\n* [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS ''Enterprise'' (CV-6)]]: Fighting Squadron Six (VF-6) had an SBC-3 and VS-6 had 20 Helldivers.\n* [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|USS ''Saratoga'' (CV-3)]]: Bombing Squadron Three (VB-3) had one SBC-3, VF-3 had an SBC-3 and VS-3 had 21 Helldivers.\n* [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|USS ''Yorktown'' (CV-5)]]: VS-5 had ten SBC-3s.<ref>Larkins, U.S. Navy p 229</ref>\n\nOne of the SBC-3s was kept at the factory and redesignated XSBC-4 (Curtiss Model 77B). This aircraft was re-engined with the 750&nbsp;hp (559&nbsp;kW) Wright R-1820-22 nine cylinder, single row, air-cooled engine\n\nThe initial contract for 58 SBC-4s was signed on 5 January 1938. This was followed by two additional contracts, one for 31 Helldivers on 27 July 1938 and the third contract for 35 aircraft on 13 August 1938. Total aircraft contracted for was 124. The aircraft were powered by the 850&nbsp;hp (634&nbsp;kW) Wright R-1820-24 engine.\n\nThe first squadron to receive the SBC-4s was VS-2 in [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'' (CV-2)]] replacing the Vought SBU-1s. By 26 June 1939, VS-2 was fully equipped with 21 aircraft. This was the only aircraft carrier that flew the SBC-4 and they were replaced by [[Douglas SBD Dauntless|Douglas SBD-2 and -3 Dauntlesses]] in 1941.\n\nBecause of the expanding aviation training program, the majority of SBC-4s, and other training aircraft, were assigned to Naval Reserve Air Bases (NRABs) to allow reserve Navy and Marine airmen assigned to reserve scouting squadrons (VS and VMS) and maintain their proficiency. By June 1940, 11 NRABs had SBC-4s as follows:\n\n* NRAB Anacostia, District of Columbia: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-6R and VMS-3R,\n* NRAB Boston, Massachusetts: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-1R, VS-2R and VMS-1R,\n* NRAB Detroit, Michigan: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-8R and VMS-5R,\n* NRAB Glenview, Illinois: .4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-9R,\n* NRAB Kansas City, Kansas: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-12R and VMS-10R,\n* NRAB Long Beach, California: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-13R, VS-14R and VMS-7R,\n* NRAB Minneapolis, Minnesota: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-10R and VMS-6R,\n* NRAB New York, New York: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-3R, VS-4R and VMS-2R,\n* NRAB Oakland, California: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-15R and VMS-8R,\n* NRAB Seattle, Washington: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-16R and VMS-9R,\n* NRAB St. Louis, Missouri: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-11R<ref>Larkins, U.S. Navy p 275.</ref>\n\nAs time advanced, the Navy acquired newer, more modern aircraft and the SBC-3s were replaced by the Douglas SBD Dauntless. By 7 December 1941, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps had 69 SBC-3s and 118 SBC-4s in the inventory based at NASs, NRABs  and the [[Naval Aircraft Factory]] (NAF) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The largest number were at NAS Miami, Florida where they were used for intermediate and dive bombing training.\n\nIn December 1941, the SBCs were based at:\n\n* NAF, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: 1 XSBC-1 and 1 SBC-3,\n* NAS Corpus Christi, Texas: 34 SBC-4s,\n* NAS Miami, Florida: 55 SBC-3s,\n* NAS Norfolk, Virginia: 4 SBC-3s and 10 SBC-4s,\n* NAS San Diego, California: 9 SBC-3s and 11 SBC-4s,\n* Naval Mission, Lima, Peru: 1 SBC-4,\n* USS Hornet (CV-8)\n**Bombing Squadron Eight (VB-8): 19 SBC-4s,\n**Scouting Squadron Eight (VS-8): 20 SBC-4s<ref>Larkins U.S. Navy pp 309\u2013310</ref>\n\t   \nHornet was undergoing sea trials in the Atlantic on 7 December and the two squadrons kept their SBC-4s until the ship sailed to San Diego, California in March 1942. At that time, the two squadrons had transitioned to the SBD-3 Dauntless and she became the last ship to operate the SBC aboard aircraft carriers.\n\nAn additional 50 SBC-4s, originally ordered by the French, were built between February and May 1941 to replace those sent overseas. The major change was replacing the 135-U.S.-gallon (511-liter) fuselage fuel tank with a 126-U.S. gallon (477-liter) self-sealing fuel tank. The last SBC-4 was delivered in May 1941.\n\nBy 1944, the SBC-3s were no longer needed and they were stricken from the inventory. The longest to survive were 12 aircraft at [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville|NAS Jacksonville, Florida]] which were stricken on 31 October 1944.\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps===\n[[File:SBC-4 VMO-151 1941 NAN1-90.jpg|thumb|Marine Observation Squadron 151 flew the SBC-4 at [[American Samoa|Samoa]] until June 1943.]]\n\nThe U.S. Marines received one SBC-3 in 1938 and which was assigned to Marine Fighter Squadron Two (VMF-2, redesignated VMF-211 on 1 July 1941) at NAS San Diego, California.<ref>Larkins, U.S. Marines p 70 and 75.</ref> It was sent to the Battle Fleet Pool in June 1939.\n\nIn January 1940, the Marine Corps had four SBC-4s.<ref>Larkins, U.S. Marines pp 86 and 87.</ref> Two were based at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), Quantico, Virginia; one was assigned to VMF-1 (redesignated VMF-111 on 1 July 1941) and the second, the XSBC-4, was assigned to Marine Utility Squadron One (VMJ-1 redesignated VMJ-152 on 7 July 1941). The other two aircraft were based at NAS, San Diego, California; one SBC-4 was assigned to VMF-2 and the second to VMJ-2 (redesignated VMJ-252 on 1 July 1941).\n\nOn 7 December 1941, the Marine Corps had 23 SBC-4s in their inventory. Twelve of them were assigned to a Marine observation squadron (VMO):\n\n* MCAS Quantico, Virginia: 1 XSBC-4 and 5 SBC-4s,\n* NAS San Diego, California: 5 SBC-4s, and \n* VMO-151, MCAS Quantico, Virginia: 12 SBC-4s<ref>Sherrod p 33.</ref>\n\nVMO-151 transferred to Tafuna (now [[Pago Pago International Airport]]), Tutuila Island, [[American Samoa]], on 9 May 1942 with their SBC-4s. The squadron was redesignated Marine Scout Bombing Squadron One Hundred Fifty One (VMSB-151) on 15 September 1942. A second observation squadron, VMO-155, was commissioned in American Samoa on 1 October 1942 by taking half of VMSB-151's personnel and equipment. VMO-155 received ten SBC-4s and a [[Grumman J2F Duck|Grumman J2F-5 Goose]] however, six officers and 15 enlisted men of the squadron returned to the U.S. on 8 December 1942 as a nucleus to form a new VMO-155 and the remaining personnel were transferred to [[Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal Island]] in the [[Solomon Islands]].<ref>Sherrod, pp 48 and 216\u2013217.</ref>\n\nIn December 1942, the VMSB-151 SBC-4s were being replaced by Douglas SBD Dauntlesses and by June 1943, the squadron had been fully equipped with SBD-4s and they moved to [[Uvea (Wallis and Futuna)|Uvea Island]] in the [[Wallis and Futuna|Wallis Group]] leaving their SBC-4s behind.\n\nThe last SBC reported in Marine squadron service was an SBC-4 at American Samoa in service with VMSB-151 on 1 June 1943.<ref>Naval Historical Center p 493.</ref>\n\n===French Navy===\n[[File:15 Curtiss SBC-4 French (CW-77) (15650913407).jpg|thumb|Three French SBC-4s on the ramp.]]\nWhen World War II began in 1939, [[British Purchasing Commission|Britain and France came to the U.S. shopping for military aircraft]]. In early 1940, the French government placed an order with Curtiss-Wright for 90 SBC-4s. To aid the French, on 6 June 1940 the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration ordered the U.S. Navy to fly 50 SBC-4s of the Naval Reserve, currently in use by the Navy, to the Curtiss-Wright factory in Buffalo, New York where the 50 planes would be refurbished to French standards. This included removing all U.S. markings on instruments and equipment, replacing the American machine guns with French 7.7-millimeter (0.303-caliber) Darne machine guns and repainting the aircraft in French camouflage colors. Once converted, the aircraft were to be delivered to [[CFB Shearwater|RCAF Station Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada]] where they would be loaded onto the [[French aircraft carrier B\u00e9arn|French aircraft carrier ''B\u00e9arn'']].\n\nSeveral neutrality acts had been passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law and the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act of 1939]] allowed for arms trade with belligerent nations (Great Britain and France) on a \"[[Cash and carry (World War II)|cash-and-carry]]\" basis. \"Cash and carry\" allowed the sale of materiel to belligerents, as long as the recipients arranged for the transport using their own ships or planes and paid immediately in cash. Because of this provision, the U.S. could not fly military aircraft into Canada; they had to land in the U.S. and be towed across the Canada\u2013US border. The 50 aircraft were to fly from Buffalo, New York to Houlton Airport, Maine via Burlington, Vermont and Augusta, Maine. [[Houlton International Airport|Houlton Airport, Maine]], was on the Canada\u2013US border and local farmers used their tractors to tow the planes into New Brunswick, Canada, where the Canadians closed the Woodstock highway so that aircraft could use it as a runway and fly to RCAF Station Dartmouth.<ref>Doll pp 34</ref>\n\nThe 50 SBC-4s were to fly to RCAF Station Dartmouth in groups of three. One of the first groups that left encountered rain and fog while flying between Buffalo and Albany, New York and one of the aircraft crashed. The remaining 49 aircraft were successfully flown to Nova Scotia to be loaded onto ''B\u00e9arn'' and the light cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Jeanne d'Arc|1930|2}}. Because of space limitations, only 44 of the SBC-4s could be carried on FR ''B\u00e9arn''; because she also had 25 Stinson Model HW-75s (also known as [[Stinson Voyager|Stinson 105]]s), 17 Curtiss H75-A1s (U.S. Army Air Corps [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|P-36]] and six [[Brewster F2A Buffalo|Brewster F2A-2 Buffalos]] for the Belgian Air Force. The ''Jeanne d'Arc'' carried 14 crated, unassembled aircraft, eight Stinson Model HW-75s and six Curtiss H75-A1s.\n\nThe two ships sailed from Halifax on 16 June 1940 bound for [[Brest, France]]. Two days later, Brest fell into German hands and both ships were ordered to [[Fort-de-France|Fort-de-France, Martinique, French West Indies]], an island in the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the eastern Caribbean Sea. They arrived on 27 June, five days after France surrendered to the Germans. The SBC-4s were unloaded and rolled to a field at the Pointe des Sables region and stored in the open.

It was the last military [[biplane]] procured by the [[United States Navy]]. Delivered in 1937, it became obsolete even before [[World War II]] and was kept well away from combat with [[Axis powers|Axis]] fighters.<ref name=\"The Hamlyn Guide to Military Aircraft Markings\">Wheeler 1992, p. 27.</ref>\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Development==\nThere was controversy in the [[United States Navy|United States Navy's]] [[Bureau of Aeronautics|Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer)]] in the early 1930s regarding two-seat fighter planes, monoplanes and the retractable undercarriage<ref>Flanagan, Major William A. [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1981/may-jun/flanagan.htm#flanagan] ''The Fighter Force, How many seats'', Air University Review, May\u2013June 1981.</ref> In 1931, the Navy issued Design Specification No. 113, which detailed a requirement for a high-performance fighter with fixed undercarriage to be powered by the [[Wright Whirlwind|Wright R-1510]]<ref name=\"Gunston p 199\">Gunston p 199</ref> or [[Pratt & Whitney R-1535 Twin Wasp Junior|Pratt & Whitney's R-1535]] [[radial engine]].<ref>Gunston p 130</ref> Seven companies submitted proposals and two companies, the [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas Aircraft]] with their [[Douglas XFD|XFD-1]]<ref>Francillon pp 138\u2013140</ref> and the [[Vought|Chance Vought]] with their [[Vought XF3U|XF3U-1]]<ref>Moran p 59</ref> were given contracts for one prototype each. Both of these aircraft were two-seat biplanes. The Navy then asked Curtiss to supply a prototype of a two-seat monoplane which was technically more advanced.\n\nOn 30 June 1932, BuAer signed a contract with Curtiss to design a two-seat monoplane with a parasol wing a retractable undercarriage and powered by a 625&nbsp;hp (466&nbsp;kW) [[Wright Whirlwind|Wright R-1510-92]] fourteen cylinder, two row, air-cooled radial engine driving a two-blade propeller. This fighter was designated XF12C-1.\n\n==Design==\nThe SBC was an all-metal, two-seat scout-bomber biplane with \u201cI\u201d-type interplane struts. It was the last combat [[biplane]] the Navy purchased and the last combat biplane manufactured in the United States. The two crewmen, pilot and radio operator/gunner, were housed in tandem cockpits enclosed by a sliding canopy and the turtledeck behind the rear cockpit could be folded down to allow the gunner to use his machine gun. The wings, rudder, elevators and flaps were fabric covered. The main landing gear retracted into wheel wells in the fuselage just forward of the lower wing and the tail wheel retracted into the fuselage.<ref>Taylor p 111</ref>\n\n===XF12C-1 (Curtiss Model 73)===\n[[File:Curtiss XF12C-1.jpg|thumb|right|The XF12C-1]]\n\nThis aircraft was initially powered by a Wright R-1510-92 engine but this was unsuitable so the aircraft was re-engined with a 775&nbsp;hp (578&nbsp;kW) [[Wright Whirlwind|Wright R-1670]] fourteen cylinder, two row, air-cooled radial engine, which was also unsatisfactory. Both of these engines were prototypes and neither went into production. Finally, the 700&nbsp;hp (522&nbsp;kW) [[Wright R-1820|Wright R-1820-80]] nine cylinder, single row, air-cooled radial engine<ref name=\"Gunston p 199\"/> was installed and the resulting aircraft, designated XF12C-1 flew in 1933. Designed for aircraft carrier usage, the parasol wing folded back, a new feature for the Navy, for storage and the aircraft had an exposed tail hook for carrier landings. The first flight was in July 1933 but in September 1934, the parasol wing failed in the dive bomber tests.<ref>Swanborough p 162</ref>\n\n===XS4C-1 (Curtiss Model 73)===\n\nAfter testing the XF12C-1 was rejected as a fighter, and on 7 December 1933 this aircraft was redesignated in the scout category as the XS4C-1 and re-engined with a 700&nbsp;hp (522&nbsp;kW) Wright R-1820-80 radial engine<ref>Jane pp88d-92d</ref> driving a two-blade propeller. In its role as a scouting aircraft, bombing equipment for a 500-pound (227-kilogram) bomb had to be designed and provided.\n\n===XSBC-1 (Curtiss Model 73)===\n\nIn January 1934 the designation scout bomber (SB) was introduced and the aircraft was finally redesignated XSBC-1. In early 1934 flight tests, especially dive-bombing, began. On 14 June 1934 this aircraft crashed- attributed to wing failure- in [[Lancaster, New York]], about 6&nbsp;mi (9.66&nbsp;km) from the Curtiss plant, during one of the tests and it was destroyed.\n\n===XSBC-2 (Curtiss Model 77)===\n\nCurtiss-Wright made a proposal to the Navy to build one replacement aircraft that would be a staggered wing biplane, would not have folding wings but would have leading edge slots and the lower wing would have full span flaps. It was an all-metal aircraft with fabric covered control surfaces. It was powered by a 700&nbsp;hp (522&nbsp;kW) Wright XR-1510-12 fourteen-cylinder, twin-row, air-cooled engine driving a constant speed Curtiss Electric three-blade propeller, an enlarged canopy, enlarged vertical fin and rudder and retractable tail hook. The XSBC-2 had to engage in competitive tests against the Great Lakes Aircraft's XB2G-1<ref>Johnson pp 37\u201339</ref> and the Grumman Aircraft Engineering's XSBF-1.<ref>Johnson pp 39\u201341</ref> The XSBC-2 won and a contract for this aircraft was signed in April 1935 and it made its first flight on 9 December 1935.\n\n===XSBC-3 (Curtiss Model 77)===\n\nThe Wright XR-1510-12 engine in the XSBC-2 proved to be mechanically unreliable. In March 1936, this aircraft was re-engined with a 700&nbsp;hp (522&nbsp;kW) Pratt & Whitney R-1535-82 fourteen-cylinder, twin-row, air-cooled engine driving a three-blade propeller and redesignated XSBC-3. With this new configuration, the Navy placed a production order.\n\n===SBC-3 (Curtiss Model 77A)===\n[[File:SBC-3 Helldiver VS-3 in flight c1939.jpeg|thumb|The VS-3 CO's SBC-3, assigned to {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3}}, circa 1939.]]\n\nThe major difference between the prototype XSBC-3 and the production aircraft was the engine. A contract for 83 aircraft was signed in August 1936 and deliveries began on 17 July 1937. The production aircraft were powered by an 825&nbsp;hp (615&nbsp;kW) Pratt & Whitney R-1535-94 fourteen-cylinder, twin-row, air-cooled engine driving a three-blade propeller. Armament consisted of two 0.30-caliber (7.62&nbsp;mm) machine guns, one fixed gun in the right side of the fuselage forward of the pilot and a flexible gun in the rear cockpit. The aircraft had a bomb displacement swing located on the centerline of the fuselage for a 500-lb (227-kg) bomb or a 45-U.S.-gallon (170-liter) fuel tank.\n\n===XSBC-4 (Curtiss Model 77B)===\n\nThe 76th SBC-3 was re-engined with a 950-hp (708&nbsp;kW) Wright R-1820-22 nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled radial engine driving a three-blade Hamilton Standard propeller and redesignated XSBC-4. The aircraft armament increased to one 0.50-caliber (12.7-mm) fixed machine gun in the right side of the fuselage forward of the pilot and a 0.30-caliber (7.62-mm) flexible machine gun in the rear cockpit. With the more powerful engine, this aircraft could carry a 1,000-lb (454-kg) bomb on the bomb displacement swing located on the centerline of the fuselage. A second SBC-3 was redesignated XSBC-4 and used for test work.\n\n===SBC-4 (Curtiss Model 77B)===\n\nThe contract for 124 production aircraft of the XSBC-4 was signed on 5 January 1938 and deliveries began in March 1939 to April 1941.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===U.S. Navy===\n\nIn August 1936, the Navy signed a contract for 83 SBC-3s (Curtiss Model 77A). Delivery of the SBC-3s to the fleet began on 17 July 1937 when the first aircraft were issued to Scouting Squadron Five (VS-5) serving in [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|USS ''Yorktown'' (CV-5)]] however, ''Yorktown'' was not commissioned until 30 September 1937 and the ship then began sea trials. On 10 December 1937, VS-5 went aboard ''Yorktown'' and served aboard her until replaced by [[Douglas SBD Dauntless|Douglas SBD-3s Dauntlesses]] in 1940.\n\nBy June 1938, three of the five scouting squadrons serving in aircraft carriers were equipped with SBC-3s while the other two were equipped with [[Vought SBU Corsair|Vought SBU-1s]]. The three ships with SBC-3s were:\n\n* [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS ''Enterprise'' (CV-6)]]: Fighting Squadron Six (VF-6) had an SBC-3 and VS-6 had 20 Helldivers.\n* [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|USS ''Saratoga'' (CV-3)]]: Bombing Squadron Three (VB-3) had one SBC-3, VF-3 had an SBC-3 and VS-3 had 21 Helldivers.\n* [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|USS ''Yorktown'' (CV-5)]]: VS-5 had ten SBC-3s.<ref>Larkins, U.S. Navy p 229</ref>\n\nOne of the SBC-3s was kept at the factory and redesignated XSBC-4 (Curtiss Model 77B). This aircraft was re-engined with the 750&nbsp;hp (559&nbsp;kW) Wright R-1820-22 nine cylinder, single row, air-cooled engine\n\nThe initial contract for 58 SBC-4s was signed on 5 January 1938. This was followed by two additional contracts, one for 31 Helldivers on 27 July 1938 and the third contract for 35 aircraft on 13 August 1938. Total aircraft contracted for was 124. The aircraft were powered by the 850&nbsp;hp (634&nbsp;kW) Wright R-1820-24 engine.\n\nThe first squadron to receive the SBC-4s was VS-2 in [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'' (CV-2)]] replacing the Vought SBU-1s. By 26 June 1939, VS-2 was fully equipped with 21 aircraft. This was the only aircraft carrier that flew the SBC-4 and they were replaced by [[Douglas SBD Dauntless|Douglas SBD-2 and -3 Dauntlesses]] in 1941.\n\nBecause of the expanding aviation training program, the majority of SBC-4s, and other training aircraft, were assigned to Naval Reserve Air Bases (NRABs) to allow reserve Navy and Marine airmen assigned to reserve scouting squadrons (VS and VMS) and maintain their proficiency. By June 1940, 11 NRABs had SBC-4s as follows:\n\n* NRAB Anacostia, District of Columbia: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-6R and VMS-3R,\n* NRAB Boston, Massachusetts: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-1R, VS-2R and VMS-1R,\n* NRAB Detroit, Michigan: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-8R and VMS-5R,\n* NRAB Glenview, Illinois: .4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-9R,\n* NRAB Kansas City, Kansas: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-12R and VMS-10R,\n* NRAB Long Beach, California: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-13R, VS-14R and VMS-7R,\n* NRAB Minneapolis, Minnesota: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-10R and VMS-6R,\n* NRAB New York, New York: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-3R, VS-4R and VMS-2R,\n* NRAB Oakland, California: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-15R and VMS-8R,\n* NRAB Seattle, Washington: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-16R and VMS-9R,\n* NRAB St. Louis, Missouri: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-11R<ref>Larkins, U.S. Navy p 275.</ref>\n\nAs time advanced, the Navy acquired newer, more modern aircraft and the SBC-3s were replaced by the Douglas SBD Dauntless. By 7 December 1941, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps had 69 SBC-3s and 118 SBC-4s in the inventory based at NASs, NRABs  and the [[Naval Aircraft Factory]] (NAF) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The largest number were at NAS Miami, Florida where they were used for intermediate and dive bombing training.\n\nIn December 1941, the SBCs were based at:\n\n* NAF, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: 1 XSBC-1 and 1 SBC-3,\n* NAS Corpus Christi, Texas: 34 SBC-4s,\n* NAS Miami, Florida: 55 SBC-3s,\n* NAS Norfolk, Virginia: 4 SBC-3s and 10 SBC-4s,\n* NAS San Diego, California: 9 SBC-3s and 11 SBC-4s,\n* Naval Mission, Lima, Peru: 1 SBC-4,\n* USS Hornet (CV-8)\n**Bombing Squadron Eight (VB-8): 19 SBC-4s,\n**Scouting Squadron Eight (VS-8): 20 SBC-4s<ref>Larkins U.S. Navy pp 309\u2013310</ref>\n\t   \nHornet was undergoing sea trials in the Atlantic on 7 December and the two squadrons kept their SBC-4s until the ship sailed to San Diego, California in March 1942. At that time, the two squadrons had transitioned to the SBD-3 Dauntless and she became the last ship to operate the SBC aboard aircraft carriers.\n\nAn additional 50 SBC-4s, originally ordered by the French, were built between February and May 1941 to replace those sent overseas. The major change was replacing the 135-U.S.-gallon (511-liter) fuselage fuel tank with a 126-U.S. gallon (477-liter) self-sealing fuel tank. The last SBC-4 was delivered in May 1941.\n\nBy 1944, the SBC-3s were no longer needed and they were stricken from the inventory. The longest to survive were 12 aircraft at [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville|NAS Jacksonville, Florida]] which were stricken on 31 October 1944.\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps===\n[[File:SBC-4 VMO-151 1941 NAN1-90.jpg|thumb|Marine Observation Squadron 151 flew the SBC-4 at [[American Samoa|Samoa]] until June 1943.]]\n\nThe U.S. Marines received one SBC-3 in 1938 and which was assigned to Marine Fighter Squadron Two (VMF-2, redesignated VMF-211 on 1 July 1941) at NAS San Diego, California.<ref>Larkins, U.S. Marines p 70 and 75.</ref> It was sent to the Battle Fleet Pool in June 1939.\n\nIn January 1940, the Marine Corps had four SBC-4s.<ref>Larkins, U.S. Marines pp 86 and 87.</ref> Two were based at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), Quantico, Virginia; one was assigned to VMF-1 (redesignated VMF-111 on 1 July 1941) and the second, the XSBC-4, was assigned to Marine Utility Squadron One (VMJ-1 redesignated VMJ-152 on 7 July 1941). The other two aircraft were based at NAS, San Diego, California; one SBC-4 was assigned to VMF-2 and the second to VMJ-2 (redesignated VMJ-252 on 1 July 1941).\n\nOn 7 December 1941, the Marine Corps had 23 SBC-4s in their inventory. Twelve of them were assigned to a Marine observation squadron (VMO):\n\n* MCAS Quantico, Virginia: 1 XSBC-4 and 5 SBC-4s,\n* NAS San Diego, California: 5 SBC-4s, and \n* VMO-151, MCAS Quantico, Virginia: 12 SBC-4s<ref>Sherrod p 33.</ref>\n\nVMO-151 transferred to Tafuna (now [[Pago Pago International Airport]]), Tutuila Island, [[American Samoa]], on 9 May 1942 with their SBC-4s. The squadron was redesignated Marine Scout Bombing Squadron One Hundred Fifty One (VMSB-151) on 15 September 1942. A second observation squadron, VMO-155, was commissioned in American Samoa on 1 October 1942 by taking half of VMSB-151's personnel and equipment. VMO-155 received ten SBC-4s and a [[Grumman J2F Duck|Grumman J2F-5 Goose]] however, six officers and 15 enlisted men of the squadron returned to the U.S. on 8 December 1942 as a nucleus to form a new VMO-155 and the remaining personnel were transferred to [[Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal Island]] in the [[Solomon Islands]].<ref>Sherrod, pp 48 and 216\u2013217.</ref>\n\nIn December 1942, the VMSB-151 SBC-4s were being replaced by Douglas SBD Dauntlesses and by June 1943, the squadron had been fully equipped with SBD-4s and they moved to [[Uvea (Wallis and Futuna)|Uvea Island]] in the [[Wallis and Futuna|Wallis Group]] leaving their SBC-4s behind.\n\nThe last SBC reported in Marine squadron service was an SBC-4 at American Samoa in service with VMSB-151 on 1 June 1943.<ref>Naval Historical Center p 493.</ref>\n\n===French Navy===\n[[File:15 Curtiss SBC-4 French (CW-77) (15650913407).jpg|thumb|Three French SBC-4s on the ramp.]]\nWhen World War II began in 1939, [[British Purchasing Commission|Britain and France came to the U.S. shopping for military aircraft]]. In early 1940, the French government placed an order with Curtiss-Wright for 90 SBC-4s. To aid the French, on 6 June 1940 the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration ordered the U.S. Navy to fly 50 SBC-4s of the Naval Reserve, currently in use by the Navy, to the Curtiss-Wright factory in Buffalo, New York where the 50 planes would be refurbished to French standards. This included removing all U.S. markings on instruments and equipment, replacing the American machine guns with French 7.7-millimeter (0.303-caliber) Darne machine guns and repainting the aircraft in French camouflage colors. Once converted, the aircraft were to be delivered to [[CFB Shearwater|RCAF Station Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada]] where they would be loaded onto the [[French aircraft carrier B\u00e9arn|French aircraft carrier ''B\u00e9arn'']].\n\nSeveral neutrality acts had been passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law and the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act of 1939]] allowed for arms trade with belligerent nations (Great Britain and France) on a \"[[Cash and carry (World War II)|cash-and-carry]]\" basis. \"Cash and carry\" allowed the sale of materiel to belligerents, as long as the recipients arranged for the transport using their own ships or planes and paid immediately in cash. Because of this provision, the U.S. could not fly military aircraft into Canada; they had to land in the U.S. and be towed across the Canada\u2013US border. The 50 aircraft were to fly from Buffalo, New York to Houlton Airport, Maine via Burlington, Vermont and Augusta, Maine. [[Houlton International Airport|Houlton Airport, Maine]], was on the Canada\u2013US border and local farmers used their tractors to tow the planes into New Brunswick, Canada, where the Canadians closed the Woodstock highway so that aircraft could use it as a runway and fly to RCAF Station Dartmouth.<ref>Doll pp 34</ref>\n\nThe 50 SBC-4s were to fly to RCAF Station Dartmouth in groups of three. One of the first groups that left encountered rain and fog while flying between Buffalo and Albany, New York and one of the aircraft crashed. The remaining 49 aircraft were successfully flown to Nova Scotia to be loaded onto ''B\u00e9arn'' and the light cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Jeanne d'Arc|1930|2}}. Because of space limitations, only 44 of the SBC-4s could be carried on FR ''B\u00e9arn''; because she also had 25 Stinson Model HW-75s (also known as [[Stinson Voyager|Stinson 105]]s), 17 Curtiss H75-A1s (U.S. Army Air Corps [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|P-36]] and six [[Brewster F2A Buffalo|Brewster F2A-2 Buffalos]] for the Belgian Air Force. The ''Jeanne d'Arc'' carried 14 crated, unassembled aircraft, eight Stinson Model HW-75s and six Curtiss H75-A1s.\n\nThe two ships sailed from Halifax on 16 June 1940 bound for [[Brest, France]]. Two days later, Brest fell into German hands and both ships were ordered to [[Fort-de-France|Fort-de-France, Martinique, French West Indies]], an island in the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the eastern Caribbean Sea. They arrived on 27 June, five days after France surrendered to the Germans. The SBC-4s were unloaded and rolled to a field at the Pointe des Sables region and stored in the open. Under tropical climatic conditions, the aircraft stored in the open were slowly rotting and were no longer airworthy and were eventually scrapped.\n\n===Royal Air Force===\n[[File:Curtiss Cleveland.jpg|thumb|right|A Cleveland I in flight]]\n\nFive of the French aircraft could not fit on FR ''B\u00e9arn'' and were left at RCAF Station Dartmouth. In August 1940, the [[Royal Air Force]] acquired them, designated them \"Cleveland Mk. Is\" and shipped them to England in the aircraft carrier [[HMS Furious (47)|HMS ''Furious'']].<ref>Doll p 36,</ref> They were assembled at [[RAF Burtonwood]], Lancashire, and delivered to [[RAF Little Rissington]], Gloucestershire and later used by No. 24 (Communications) Squadron at [[Hendon Aerodrome|RAF Hendon]], Middlesex.<ref>Thetford p 579</ref> These aircraft were never used operationally and became ground trainers.<ref>Halley pp 64\u201365</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n\n;XF12C-1\n:Prototype parasol-wing fighter powered by a {{convert|625|hp|kW|lk=in|abbr=on}} R-1510-92 radial; one built, later converted into biplane as the XS4C-1.\n;XS4C-1\n:Prototype was redesignated in the \"scout\" category before being redesignated again as the XSBC-1.\n;XSBC-1\n:Prototype redesignated from XS4C-1, a biplane with an R-1820-80.\n;XSBC-2\n:Redesigned biplane based on XSBC-1 and powered by a {{convert|700|hp|kW|abbr=on}} XR-1510-12; one built.\n;XSBC-3\n:XSBC-2 re-engined with a {{convert|750|hp|kW|abbr=on}} R-1535-82.\n;SBC-3\n:Production variant with an {{convert|825|hp|kW|abbr=on}} R-1534-94; 83 built.\n;XSBC-4\n:SBC-3 re-engined with a {{convert|950|hp|kW|abbr=on}} R-1820-22; one conversion.\n;SBC-4\n:Production variant with a 950 hp R-1820-34; 174 built, including 50 transferred to the French Navy.\n;Cleveland I\n:British designation for five SBC-4s.\n\n==Operators==\n{{FRA}}\n*[[French Navy]] \n{{GBR}}\n*[[Royal Air Force]]\n{{USA}}\n*[[United States Marine Corps]]\n*[[United States Navy]]\n\n==Specifications (SBC-4)==\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=Curtiss Aircraft 1907\u20131947<ref name=\"Bowers Curtiss p372\">Bowers 1979, p. 372.</ref>\n|prime units?=imp\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|crew=2\n|length ft=28\n|length in=1+9/16\n|length note=\n|span ft=34\n|span in=0\n|span note=\n|height ft=10\n|height in=5\n|height note=\n|wing area sqft=317\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=<!-- sailplanes -->\n|airfoil=[[NACA airfoil|NACA 2212]]<ref name=\"Selig\">{{cite web |last1=Lednicer |first1=David |title=The Incomplete Guide to Airfoil Usage |url=https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/aircraft.html |website=m-selig.ae.illinois.edu |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref>\n|empty weight lb=4552\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight lb=7080\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight lb=\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|lift lb=<!-- lighter-than-air -->\n|lift note=\n|more general=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=[[Wright R-1820]]-34\n|eng1 type=[[radial engine]]\n|eng1 hp=850\n\n|prop blade number=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop name=\n|prop dia ft=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia in=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia note=\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|max speed mph=234\n|max speed note=at {{cvt|15200|ft}}\n|max speed mach=<!-- supersonic aircraft -->\n|cruise speed mph=175\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|minimum control speed mph=\n|minimum control speed note=\n|range miles=405\n|range note=\n|combat range miles=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range miles=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=<!-- if range unknown -->\n|ceiling ft=24000\n|ceiling note=\n|climb rate ftmin=1630\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|sink rate ftmin=<!-- sailplanes -->\n|sink rate note=\n|lift to drag=\n\n|more performance=\n<!--\n        Armament\n-->\n|guns=<br/>\n*1 \u00d7 {{cvt|0.30|in}} forward-firing [[M1919 Browning machine gun]]\n*1 \u00d7 {{cvt|0.30|in}} flexible rearward-firing machine gun\n|bombs=1 \u00d7 bomb of up to 1,000 lb (454 kg)\n|avionics=\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{aircontent\n|similar aircraft=\n*[[Aichi D1A]]\n*[[Henschel Hs 123]]\n*[[Polikarpov R-5]]\n|lists=\n* [[List of aircraft of World War II]]\n*[[List of military aircraft of the United States (naval)]]\n*[[List of aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm]]\n|see also=\n}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Angelucci, Enzo.
