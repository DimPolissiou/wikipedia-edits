He went on to study film at [[The University of Southern California]] alongside other notable directors [[George Lucas]], [[Robert Zemeckis]] and [[John Carpenter]]. Franklin was a devotee of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] (ever since he saw ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' at the age of 12), and his attempt to arrange for a screening of Hitchcock's ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948) at USC resulted in a phone-call from Hitchcock himself. Franklin invited Hitchcock to give a lecture at the university, and subsequently he became good friends with the director.<ref name=\"atdd\" />\n\n==Directing career==\n\nFranklin returned to Australia in the 1970s, when the country's film industry was experiencing a resurgence. He directed four episodes of the Australian police drama ''[[Homicide (Australian TV series)|Homicide]]'' before directing the bawdy 1975 sex comedy feature ''[[The True Story of Eskimo Nell]]'' and the 1976 soft-core pornography feature ''[[Fantasm]]''. Franklin's next film was the cult horror movie ''[[Patrick (1978 film)|Patrick]]'' (1978), written by [[Everett De Roche]], about a man in a coma who uses telekinesis to create murder and mayhem in a hospital. Franklin gave De Roche a copy of the screenplay of Alfred Hitchcock's ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), and De Roche suggested a movie with the plot of ''Rear Window'' taking place in a moving vehicle. The result was ''[[Roadgames]]'' (1981), directed by Franklin from a screenplay by De Roche. Filmed and set in Australia, and starring American actors [[Stacy Keach]] and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (the latter of whom Franklin met whilst visiting his one-time USC classmate John Carpenter on the set of ''[[The Fog]]''), ''Roadgames'' was the most expensive Australian movie ever made at the time of its release in 1981.<ref name=\"atdd\" />\n\n===US films===\nAfter moving to Hollywood, Richard Franklin directed ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' (1983), the first sequel to Hitchcock's 1960 classic ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', with [[Anthony Perkins]] reprising the role of [[Norman Bates]]. The film was a financial success and received generally good reviews (it also led to a further two sequels, neither of which Franklin was involved with). Franklin then directed the 1984 spy/adventure movie ''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'', starring [[Henry Thomas]] and [[Dabney Coleman]]. The film was a remake of ''[[The Window (1949 film)|The Window]]'' (1949), which was in turn based on the short story \"The Boy Who Cried Murder\" by [[Cornell Woolrich]] (Woolrich's short story \"It Had to Be Murder\" was adapted into Hitchcock's ''Rear Window'', which was the inspiration for Franklin's ''Road Games''). \n\nFranklin was going to make ''The Lost Boys'' at one stage<ref>http://www.avclub.com/article/tom-holland-his-seminal-vampire-flick-fright-night-223200</ref> but his next film was ''[[Link (film)|Link]]'' (1986) a British horror movie (starring [[Elisabeth Shue]] and [[Terence Stamp]]) about a super-intelligent, murderous [[orangutan]]. The film reunited Franklin with screenwriter Everett De Roche. \n\nFranklin was disillusioned with Hollywood after the experience of directing the 1991 action/thriller ''[[F/X2|FX2: The Deadly Art Of Illusion]]'' (starring [[Bryan Brown]] and [[Brian Dennehy]]).\n\n===Return to Australia===\nHe returned to Australia where he filmed ''[[Hotel Sorrento]]'' (1995) and ''[[Brilliant Lies]]'' (1996). Franklin called these films\n<blockquote>Very conscious attempts to prove that I could do what Australian filmmakers like Peter Weir and Bruce Beresford had done, which was make very classy arthouse types of films.

Both lines were designed specifically as signature products for Satriani. The Ibanez JS1 (the original JS model) was based on, and replaced, the Ibanez 540 Radius model that Satriani first endorsed. Many of his guitars are made by [[Ibanez]], including the JS1000, and JS1200. These guitars typically feature the [[DiMarzio]] PAF Pro (which he used up until 1993 in both the neck and bridge positions), the [[DiMarzio]] Fred (which he used in the bridge position from 1993 to 2005), and the Mo' Joe and the Paf Joe (which he uses in the bridge and neck positions, respectively, from 2005 to present day). He has more recently introduced the [https://www.dimarzio.com/pickups/hum-canceling-strat/satch-track-neck Satch Track] single coil pickup which he used in his Humbucker/Single coil equipped signature Ibanez guitars. He has since replaced the Satch Track with the [https://www.sustainiac.com/ Sustainiac].\n\nThe JS line of guitars is his signature line with the JS1000, JS1200, JS2400, JSBDG, and JS20th using Ibanez's original Edge double locking tremolo bridge. The JS100 and JS120s both use Ibanez's Edge 3 tremolo bridge. The JS1600 is a fixed bridge guitar with no tremolo system. The guitar he was most associated with during the 90s was a chrome-finished guitar nicknamed \"Chrome Boy\". This instrument can be seen on the ''[[Live in San Francisco (Joe Satriani album)|Live in San Francisco]]'' DVD. However, the guitar used for most of the concert was in fact a lookalike nicknamed \"Pearly,\" which featured [[Seymour Duncan]] Pearly Gates pickups.\n\nSatriani uses a number of other JS models such as the JS double neck model, JS700 (primary axe on the self-titled CD and seen on the 1995 tour \"Joe Satriani,\" which features a fixed bridge, [[P-90]] pickups, and a matching mahogany body and neck), JS6/JS6000 (natural body), JS1 (the original JS model), JS2000 (fixed bridge model), a variety of JS100s, JS1000s and JS1200s with custom paint work, and a large amount of prototype JSs. All double locking bridges have been the original Edge tremolo, not the newer models, which point to a more custom guitar than the \"off the shelf\" models. Satriani played a red 7-string JS model, seen in the \"G3 Live in Tokyo\" DVD from 2005. He also has a prototype 24-fret version of the JS\u2014now called the JS-2400\u2014which he has used with Chickenfoot. As of late he has used other prototypes featuring a Sustainiac (as mentioned above) or a JS model with three single coil-sized humbucker pickups.\n\nSatriani's guitars are usually equipped with his signature DiMarzio humbucker pickups, Mo' Joe and PAF Joe, and his 24-fret JS model features a signature single-coil sized humbucker called the Satch Track in the neck position.<ref>{{cite web|title=DiMarzio Releases Satch Track, Joe Satriani's First Single-Coil-Size Signature Pickup|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/dimarzio-releases-satch-track-joe-satrianis-first-single-coil-size-signature-pickup|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420212901/http://www.guitarworld.com/dimarzio-releases-satch-track-joe-satrianis-first-single-coil-size-signature-pickup|archivedate=April 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Some of his guitars are still equipped with the pickup models he favored in the past, the DiMarzio FRED and PAF Pro pickups.\n\nSatriani has used a wide variety of [[guitar amps]], using [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] for his main amplifier (notably the limited edition blue coloured 6100 LM model) up until 2001, and his Peavey signature series amps, the Peavey JSX, up until his time with Chickenfoot.\n\n[[File:JS Guitars 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Guitars used by Satriani during the 2013 ''[[Unstoppable Momentum]]'' tour.]]\nThe JSX began life as a prototype Peavey XXX and developed into the Joe Satriani signature Peavey model. However he still used distortion pedals with the clean channel rather than the built-in overdrive channels. Satriani has used other amplifiers over the years in the studio, such as the Peavey 5150 (used to record the song '[[Crystal Planet]]'), Cornford, and the [[Mesa/Boogie]] Mark IIC+ (used to record the song '[[Flying in a Blue Dream]]'), amongst others. He has recently switched to the Marshall JVM series, having used a modified JVM 410H in his Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards tour in 2010 and with Chickenfoot in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThese modified JVM Marshall amps were prototypes for a signature amp that Marshall scheduled for release in 2011. They replaced the [[reverb]] with [[noise gate]]s that eliminate lag when switching channels. The clean channel was replaced by the clean channel of a 6100 LM model, which Satriani likes as an option to use [[distortion pedal]]s with. The orange [[od channel]] and the modern red overdrive channel have been better matched with each other as Satriani claims to prefer the organic overdrive of the JVM over pedals. The red overdrive channel was modified for a beefy rock rather than a [[nu metal]] sound. The effect loop has been simplified to be serial only.\n\nSatriani has used many amps in the studio when recording, including the Peavey Classic. He used Marshall heads and cabinets, including live, prior to his Peavey endorsement. Recently Satriani used the JSX head through a Palmer Speaker Simulator. He has released a Class-A 5-watt tube amp called the \"Mini Colossal\".

Both lines were designed specifically as signature products for Satriani. The Ibanez JS1 (the original JS model) was based on, and replaced, the Ibanez 540 Radius model that Satriani first endorsed. Many of his guitars are made by [[Ibanez]], including the JS1000, and JS1200. These guitars typically feature the [[DiMarzio]] PAF Pro (which he used up until 1993 in both the neck and bridge positions), the [[DiMarzio]] Fred (which he used in the bridge position from 1993 to 2005), and the Mo' Joe and the Paf Joe (which he uses in the bridge and neck positions, respectively, from 2005 to present day). He has more recently introduced the [https://www.dimarzio.com/pickups/hum-canceling-strat/satch-track-neck Satch Track] single coil pickup which he used in his Humbucker/Single coil equipped signature Ibanez guitars. He has since replaced the Satch Track with the [https://www.sustainiac.com/ Sustainiac].\n\nThe JS line of guitars is his signature line with the JS1000, JS1200, JS2400, JSBDG, and JS20th using Ibanez's original Edge double locking tremolo bridge. The JS100 and JS120s both use Ibanez's Edge 3 tremolo bridge. The JS1600 is a fixed bridge guitar with no tremolo system. The guitar he was most associated with during the 90s was a chrome-finished guitar nicknamed \"Chrome Boy\". This instrument can be seen on the ''[[Live in San Francisco (Joe Satriani album)|Live in San Francisco]]'' DVD. However, the guitar used for most of the concert was in fact a lookalike nicknamed \"Pearly,\" which featured [[Seymour Duncan]] Pearly Gates pickups.\n\nSatriani uses a number of other JS models such as the JS double neck model, JS700 (primary axe on the self-titled CD and seen on the 1995 tour \"Joe Satriani,\" which features a fixed bridge, [[P-90]] pickups, and a matching mahogany body and neck), JS6/JS6000 (natural body), JS1 (the original JS model), JS2000 (fixed bridge model), a variety of JS100s, JS1000s and JS1200s with custom paint work, and a large amount of prototype JSs. All double locking bridges have been the original Edge tremolo, not the newer models, which point to a more custom guitar than the \"off the shelf\" models. Satriani played a red 7-string JS model, seen in the \"G3 Live in Tokyo\" DVD from 2005. He also has a prototype 24-fret version of the JS\u2014now called the JS-2400\u2014which he has used with Chickenfoot. As of late he has used other prototypes featuring a Sustainiac (as mentioned above) or a JS model with three single coil-sized humbucker pickups.\n\nSatriani's guitars are usually equipped with his signature DiMarzio humbucker pickups, Mo' Joe and PAF Joe, and his 24-fret JS model features a signature single-coil sized humbucker called the Satch Track in the neck position.<ref>{{cite web|title=DiMarzio Releases Satch Track, Joe Satriani's First Single-Coil-Size Signature Pickup|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/dimarzio-releases-satch-track-joe-satrianis-first-single-coil-size-signature-pickup|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420212901/http://www.guitarworld.com/dimarzio-releases-satch-track-joe-satrianis-first-single-coil-size-signature-pickup|archivedate=April 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Some of his guitars are still equipped with the pickup models he favored in the past, the DiMarzio FRED and PAF Pro pickups.\n\nSatriani has used a wide variety of [[guitar amps]], using [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] for his main amplifier (notably the limited edition blue coloured 6100 LM model) up until 2001, and his Peavey signature series amps, the Peavey JSX, up until his time with Chickenfoot.\n\n[[File:JS Guitars 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Guitars used by Satriani during the 2013 ''[[Unstoppable Momentum]]'' tour.]]\nThe JSX began life as a prototype Peavey XXX and developed into the Joe Satriani signature Peavey model. However he still used distortion pedals with the clean channel rather than the built-in overdrive channels. Satriani has used other amplifiers over the years in the studio, such as the Peavey 5150 (used to record the song '[[Crystal Planet]]'), Cornford, and the [[Mesa/Boogie]] Mark IIC+ (used to record the song '[[Flying in a Blue Dream]]'), amongst others. He has recently switched to the Marshall JVM series, having used a modified JVM 410H in his Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards tour in 2010 and with Chickenfoot in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThese modified JVM Marshall amps were prototypes for a signature amp that Marshall scheduled for release in 2011. They replaced the [[reverb]] with [[noise gate]]s that eliminate lag when switching channels. The clean channel was replaced by the clean channel of a 6100 LM model, which Satriani likes as an option to use [[distortion pedal]]s with. The orange [[od channel]] and the modern red overdrive channel have been better matched with each other as Satriani claims to prefer the organic overdrive of the JVM over pedals. The red overdrive channel was modified for a beefy rock rather than a [[nu metal]] sound. The effect loop has been simplified to be serial only.\n\nSatriani has used many amps in the studio when recording, including the Peavey Classic. He used Marshall heads and cabinets, including live, prior to his Peavey endorsement. Recently Satriani used the JSX head through a Palmer Speaker Simulator. He has released a Class-A 5-watt tube amp called the \"Mini Colossal\". In 2009, Satriani split from Peavey,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vhnd.com/2009/06/23/the-genuinely-bizarre-case-of-the-satrianipeavey-endoresment-deals-collapse/ |title=The Genuinely Bizarre Case Of The Satriani/Peavey Endorsement Deal\u2019s Collapse &#124; Van Halen News Desk |publisher=Vhnd.com |date=2009-06-23 |accessdate=2015-11-04 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305103712/http://www.vhnd.com/2009/06/23/the-genuinely-bizarre-case-of-the-satrianipeavey-endoresment-deals-collapse/ |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and returned to using Marshall amps.

It would have featured [[sampling (music)|sampled]] sounds from the ''[[Starship Enterprise]]'' from ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. But as Satriani explained in a [[podcast]], legal issues regarding the samples could not be resolved, and he was unable to get permission to use them.<ref>[http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/JoeSatriani/podcast/super_colossal/13_crowd_chant_podcast.mp3 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219061034/http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/JoeSatriani/podcast/super_colossal/13_crowd_chant_podcast.mp3 |date=December 19, 2008 }}</ref> He then removed the sounds from the song and called it \"Crowd Chant\".
