More than a third of the Class of 2009 substantially exceeded the requirement. Students can create their own placements, or select from 1,200 slots in 400 public interest organizations in Philadelphia and nationwide. The law school awards Toll Public Interest Scholarships to accomplished public interest matriculants, and has a generous Public Interest Loan Repayment Program for graduates pursuing careers in public interest. Students interested in public interest work receive funding for summer positions through money from the student-run Equal Justice Foundation or via funding from Penn Law.  Additionally, the law school funds students interested in working internationally through the International Human Rights Fellowship.\n\n==Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law==\nThe Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law (CERL or Center) is a non-partisan, interdisciplinary research and policy institute at the University of Pennsylvania. CERL focuses on the application of the rule of law and ethics to pressing issues of [[national security]], [[Veterans affairs|veterans' affairs]], [[War|armed conflict]], and [[International crisis|transnational crises]]. CERL was co-founded in 2012 by Professor [[Claire Finkelstein]], Algernon Biddle Professor of Law and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and by William Craven, Chairman of Federal Systems and the Center's first Executive Board Chair, principally as a direct response to the interrogation policies and abuses in the post-9/11 era,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2012/09/penn-law-unveils-center-for-ethics-and-the-rule-of-law|title=Penn Law unveils Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law|last=Bromfield|first=Heather|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-us}}</ref> including at Baghdad's [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib Prison]].\n\nThe central mission of CERL is to protect and promote rule of law values and ethical principles in the face of international challenges such as conflict with violent non-state actors, (seemingly) irrational and dangerous enemies, and transnational security risks. Its primary means of accomplishing this is to foster an exchange of ideas among academics, analysts, and practitioners regarding the interplay of rule of law/ethics and national and international security matters; to share the products of those discussions through published volumes or in open forums to raise public consciousness; and to prepare briefing papers and otherwise disseminate its views to educate policymakers as well as to impact public discussion.\n\nMuch of CERL's work to date has revolved around setting up two annual [[Round table (discussion)|roundtable]], interdisciplinary conferences that bring together scholars and practitioners to consult on critical global issues relating to national or international security and the rule of law. Articles authored for the conference are then compiled with other writings into published volumes by [[Oxford University Press]]. CERL's event topics have been wide-ranging and included The Ethics of Autonomous Weapons Systems (November 2014),<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://issuu.com/pennlawits/docs/cerl_annual_report_2014-2015|title=CERL Annual Report 2014-2015|last=|first=|date=|work=issuu|access-date=2017-09-25|pages=22\u201323|language=en}}</ref> Preventing and Treating the Invisible Wounds of War: Combat Trauma and Psychological Injury (December 2015), The Ethics of Negotiation in Armed Conflict (April 2016), Using Law to Fight Terror: Legal Approaches to Combating Violent Non-State Actors (September 2016), Preserving Art and Culture in Times of War (April 2017), and Foreign Interference with Democratic Institutions (April 2017).

More than a third of the Class of 2009 substantially exceeded the requirement. Students can create their own placements, or select from 1,200 slots in 400 public interest organizations in Philadelphia and nationwide. The law school awards Toll Public Interest Scholarships to accomplished public interest matriculants, and has a generous Public Interest Loan Repayment Program for graduates pursuing careers in public interest. Students interested in public interest work receive funding for summer positions through money from the student-run Equal Justice Foundation or via funding from Penn Law.  Additionally, the law school funds students interested in working internationally through the International Human Rights Fellowship.\n\n==Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law==\nThe Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law (CERL or Center) is a non-partisan, interdisciplinary research and policy institute at the University of Pennsylvania. CERL focuses on the application of the rule of law and ethics to pressing issues of [[national security]], [[Veterans affairs|veterans' affairs]], [[War|armed conflict]], and [[International crisis|transnational crises]]. CERL was co-founded in 2012 by Professor [[Claire Finkelstein]], Algernon Biddle Professor of Law and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and by William Craven, Chairman of Federal Systems and the Center's first Executive Board Chair, principally as a direct response to the interrogation policies and abuses in the post-9/11 era,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2012/09/penn-law-unveils-center-for-ethics-and-the-rule-of-law|title=Penn Law unveils Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law|last=Bromfield|first=Heather|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-us}}</ref> including at Baghdad's [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib Prison]].\n\nThe central mission of CERL is to protect and promote rule of law values and ethical principles in the face of international challenges such as conflict with violent non-state actors, (seemingly) irrational and dangerous enemies, and transnational security risks. Its primary means of accomplishing this is to foster an exchange of ideas among academics, analysts, and practitioners regarding the interplay of rule of law/ethics and national and international security matters; to share the products of those discussions through published volumes or in open forums to raise public consciousness; and to prepare briefing papers and otherwise disseminate its views to educate policymakers as well as to impact public discussion.\n\nMuch of CERL's work to date has revolved around setting up two annual [[Round table (discussion)|roundtable]], interdisciplinary conferences that bring together scholars and practitioners to consult on critical global issues relating to national or international security and the rule of law. Articles authored for the conference are then compiled with other writings into published volumes by [[Oxford University Press]]. CERL's event topics have been wide-ranging and included The Ethics of Autonomous Weapons Systems (November 2014),<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://issuu.com/pennlawits/docs/cerl_annual_report_2014-2015|title=CERL Annual Report 2014-2015|last=|first=|date=|work=issuu|access-date=2017-09-25|pages=22\u201323|language=en}}</ref> Preventing and Treating the Invisible Wounds of War: Combat Trauma and Psychological Injury (December 2015), The Ethics of Negotiation in Armed Conflict (April 2016), Using Law to Fight Terror: Legal Approaches to Combating Violent Non-State Actors (September 2016), Preserving Art and Culture in Times of War (April 2017), and Foreign Interference with Democratic Institutions (April 2017).
