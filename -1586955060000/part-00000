All nouns are further grouped into two [[Grammatical gender|gender]] categories, masculine gender and feminine gender. In many languages, gender is overtly marked directly on the noun (e.g. in [[Awngi language|Awngi]], where all female nouns carry the suffix ''-a'').{{sfnp|Appleyard|2012|pp=204\u2013206}}\n\nThe case system of many Cushitic languages is characterized by [[Marked nominative language|marked nominative]] alignment, which is [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] quite rare and predominantly found in languages of Africa.{{sfnp|K\u00f6nig|2008|p=138}} In marked nominative languages, the noun appears in unmarked \"absolutive\" case when cited in isolation, or when used as predicative noun and as object of a transitive verb; on the other hand, it is explicitly marked for nominative case when it functions as subject in a transitive or intransitive sentence.{{sfnp|Appleyard|2012|pp=205}}{{sfnp|Mous|2012|p=369}}\n\nPossession is usually expressed by [[genitive case]] marking of the possessor. [[South Cushitic]]\u2014which has no case marking for subject and object\u2014follows the opposite strategy: here, the possessed noun is marked for [[construct case]], e.g. Iraqw ''af\u00e9-r mar'i'' \"doors\" (lit. \"mouths of houses\"), where ''afee'' \"mouth\" is marked for construct case.{{sfnp|Mous|2012|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\nMost nouns are by default unmarked for number, but can be explicitly marked for singular (\"[[singulative number|singulative]]\") and plural number. E.g. in [[Bilen language|Bilin]], ''d\u0259mmu'' \"cat(s)\" is number-neutral, from which singular ''d\u0259mmura'' \"a single cat\" and plural ''d\u0259mmura'' \"several cats\" can be formed. Plural formation is very diverse, and employs [[ablaut]] (i.e. changes of root vowels or consonants), [[suffix]]es and [[reduplication]].{{sfnp|Appleyard|2012|p=204}}{{sfnp|Mous|2012|pp=361\u2013363}}\n\n====Verbs====\nVerbs are inflected for person/number and tense/aspect. Many languages also have a special form of the verb in negative clauses.{{sfnp|Mous|2012|p=389}}\n\nMost languages distinguish seven person/number categories: first, second, third person, singular and plural number, with a masculine/feminine gender distinction in third person singular. The most common conjugation type employs suffixes. Some languages also have a prefix conjugation: in [[Beja language|Beja]] and the [[Saho\u2013Afar languages]], the prefix conjugation is still a productive part of the verb paradigm, whereas in most other languages, e.g. [[Somali language|Somali]], it is restricted to only a few verbs. Historically, it is generally assumed that the suffix conjugation developed from the older prefix conjugation, by combining the verb stem with a suffixed auxilliary verb.{{sfnp|Appleyard|2012|pp=207-208}} The following table gives an example for the suffix and prefix conjugations in affirmative present tense in Somali.{{sfnp|Appleyard|2012|pp=254-255}}\n\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:left\n|-\n!\n! \"bring\" !! \"come\"\n|-\n! 1.sg.\n| ''keen-aa'' || ''i-maadd-aa''\n|-\n! 2.sg.\n| ''keen-taa'' || ''ti-maadd-aa''\n|-\n! 3.sg.masc.\n| ''keen-aa'' || ''yi-maadd-aa''\n|-\n! 3.sg.fem.\n| ''keen-taa'' || ''ti-maadd-aa''\n|-\n! 1.pl.\n| ''keen-naa'' || ''ni-maad-naa''\n|-\n! 2.pl.\n| ''keen-taan'' || ''ti-maadd-aan''\n|-\n! 3.pl.\n| ''keen-aan'' || ''yi-maadd-aan''\n|}\n\n====Syntax====\nBasic [[word order]] is verb final, the most common order being [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] (SOV).

They have traditionally been assigned to an East Cushitic subbranch along with Highland (Sidamic) and Lowland East Cushitic.

However, this view has been abandoned. Omotic is generally agreed to be an independent branch of Afroasiatic, primarily due to the work of [[Harold C.

Marianne Bechhaus-Gerst (2000) proposed that the peoples of the [[Kerma Culture]] \u2013 which inhabited the Nile Valley in present-day [[Sudan]] immediately before the arrival of the first Nubian speakers \u2013 spoke Cushitic languages.<ref name=\"Bechaus-Gerst b\">{{harvnb|Bechhaus-Gerst|2000}}, p. 453.</ref> She argues that the Nilo-Saharan [[Nobiin language]] today contains a number of key pastoralism related [[loanword]]s that are of proto-Highland East Cushitic origin, including the terms for sheep/goatskin, hen/cock, livestock enclosure, butter and milk. However, more recent linguistic research indicates that the people of the Kerma culture (who were based in [[Upper Nubia|southern Nubia]]) instead spoke [[Nilo-Saharan]] languages of the [[Eastern Sudanic]] branch, and that the peoples of the C-Group culture to their north (in [[Lower Nubia|northern Nubia]]) and other groups in northern Nubia (such as the [[Medjay]] and Belmmyes) spoke Cushitic languages with the latter being related to the modern [[Beja language]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rilly C  | title = Recent Research on Meroitic, the Ancient Language of Sudan | date = 2010 |url = http://www.ityopis.org/Issues-1_files/ITYOPIS-I-Rilly.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |doi=10.31338/uw.9788323533269.pp.211-226 |chapter=Enemy brothers.

In Lower Nubia there was an Afroasiatic language, likely a branch of Cushitic. By the end of the first millennium CE this region had been encroached upon and replaced by Eastern Sudanic speakers arriving from the south and west, to be identified first with Meroitic and later migrations attributable to Nubian speakers.\"}}\n\nIn Handbook of Ancient Nubia, Claude Rilly (2019) states that Cushitic languages once dominated [[Lower Nubia]] along with the [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] language.{{sfnp|Rilly|2019|p=130|ps=: \"Two Afro-Asiatic languages were present in antiquity in Nubia, namely Ancient Egyptian and Cushitic.\"}}.

All nouns are further grouped into two [[Grammatical gender|gender]] categories, masculine gender and feminine gender. In many languages, gender is overtly marked directly on the noun (e.g. in [[Awngi language|Awngi]], where all female nouns carry the suffix ''-a'').{{sfnp|Appleyard|2012|pp=204\u2013206}}\n\nThe case system of many Cushitic languages is characterized by [[Marked nominative language|marked nominative]] alignment, which is [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] quite rare and predominantly found in languages of Africa.{{sfnp|K\u00f6nig|2008|p=138}} In marked nominative languages, the noun appears in unmarked \"absolutive\" case when cited in isolation, or when used as predicative noun and as object of a transitive verb; on the other hand, it is explicitly marked for nominative case when it functions as subject in a transitive or intransitive sentence.{{sfnp|Appleyard|2012|pp=205}}{{sfnp|Mous|2012|p=369}}\n\nPossession is usually expressed by [[genitive case]] marking of the possessor. [[South Cushitic]]\u2014which has no case marking for subject and object\u2014follows the opposite strategy: here, the possessed noun is marked for [[construct case]], e.g. Iraqw ''af\u00e9-r mar'i'' \"doors\" (lit. \"mouths of houses\"), where ''afee'' \"mouth\" is marked for construct case.{{sfnp|Mous|2012|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\nMost nouns are by default unmarked for number, but can be explicitly marked for singular (\"[[singulative number|singulative]]\") and plural number. E.g. in [[Bilen language|Bilin]], ''d\u0259mmu'' \"cat(s)\" is number-neutral, from which singular ''d\u0259mmura'' \"a single cat\" and plural ''d\u0259mmura'' \"several cats\" can be formed. Plural formation is very diverse, and employs [[ablaut]] (i.e. changes of root vowels or consonants), [[suffix]]es and [[reduplication]].{{sfnp|Appleyard|2012|p=204}}{{sfnp|Mous|2012|pp=361\u2013363}}\n\n====Verbs====\nVerbs are inflected for person/number and tense/aspect. Many languages also have a special form of the verb in negative clauses.{{sfnp|Mous|2012|p=389}}\n\nMost languages distinguish seven person/number categories: first, second, third person, singular and plural number, with a masculine/feminine gender distinction in third person singular. The most common conjugation type employs suffixes. Some languages also have a prefix conjugation: in [[Beja language|Beja]] and the [[Saho\u2013Afar languages]], the prefix conjugation is still a productive part of the verb paradigm, whereas in most other languages, e.g. [[Somali language|Somali]], it is restricted to only a few verbs. Historically, it is generally assumed that the suffix conjugation developed from the older prefix conjugation, by combining the verb stem with a suffixed auxilliary verb.{{sfnp|Appleyard|2012|pp=207-208}} The following table gives an example for the suffix and prefix conjugations in affirmative present tense in Somali.{{sfnp|Appleyard|2012|pp=254-255}}\n\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:left\n|-\n!\n! \"bring\" !! \"come\"\n|-\n! 1.sg.\n| ''keen-aa'' || ''i-maadd-aa''\n|-\n! 2.sg.\n| ''keen-taa'' || ''ti-maadd-aa''\n|-\n! 3.sg.masc.\n| ''keen-aa'' || ''yi-maadd-aa''\n|-\n! 3.sg.fem.\n| ''keen-taa'' || ''ti-maadd-aa''\n|-\n! 1.pl.\n| ''keen-naa'' || ''ni-maad-naa''\n|-\n! 2.pl.\n| ''keen-taan'' || ''ti-maadd-aan''\n|-\n! 3.pl.\n| ''keen-aan'' || ''yi-maadd-aan''\n|}\n\n====Syntax====\nBasic [[word order]] is verb final, the most common order being [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] (SOV).

However, this view has been abandoned. Omotic is generally agreed to be an independent branch of Afroasiatic, primarily due to the work of [[Harold C.

He mentions historical records of the [[Blemmyes]], a Cushitic speaking tribe which controlled [[Lower Nubia]] and some cities in [[Upper Egypt]].{{sfnp|Rilly|2019|p=133|ps=: \"The Blemmyes are another Cushitic speaking tribe, or more likely a subdivision of the Medjay/Beja people, which is attested in Napatan and Egyptian texts from the 6th century BC on.\"}}{{sfnp|Rilly|2019|p=134a|ps=: \"From the end of the 4th century until the 6th century AD, they held parts of Lower Nubia and some cities of Upper Egypt.\"}} He mentions the linguistic relationship between the modern [[Beja language]] and the ancient Blemmyan language, and that the Blemmyes can be regarded as a particular tribe of the Medjay.{{sfnp|Rilly|2019|p=134b|ps=: \"The Blemmyan language is so close to modern Beja that it is probably nothing else than an early dialect of the same language In this case, the Blemmyes can be regarded as a particular tribe of the Medjay.\"}}\n\nAdditionally, historiolinguistics indicate that the makers of the [[Savanna Pastoral Neolithic]] (Stone Bowl Culture) in the Great Lakes area likely spoke South Cushitic languages.{{sfnp|Ambrose|1984|p=234}}\n\n[[Christopher Ehret]] (1998) proposed on the basis of loanwords that South Cushitic languages (called \"Tale\" and \"Bisha\" by Ehret) were spoken in an area closer to Lake Victoria than are found today.<ref name=\"Mous\">{{cite book |last1=Kie\u00dfling |first1=Roland |first2=Maarten |last2=Mous |first3=Derek |last3=Nurse |year=2007 |chapter=The Tanzanian Rift Valley area |title=A Linguistic Geography of Africa |editors=Bernd Heine & Derek Nurse |chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/825370 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAlso, historically, the [[Southern Nilotic languages]] have undergone extensive contact with a \"missing\" branch of [[East Cushitic languages|East Cushitic]] that Heine (1979) refers to as ''Baz''.<ref name=\"Guldemann\">{{Cite book|title=The Languages and Linguistics of Africa|last=G\u00fcldemann|first=Tom|editor-last=G\u00fcldemann|editor-first=Tom|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|chapter=Historical linguistics and genealogical language classification in Africa|year=2018|edition=|isbn=978-3-11-042606-9|doi=10.1515/9783110421668-002|location=Berlin|pages=58-444|series=The World of Linguistics series|volume=11}}</ref><ref>Heine, Bernd, Franz Rottland & Rainer Vo\u00dfen. 1979.

Thus the mean value theorem says that given any chord of a smooth curve, we can find a point lying between the end-points of the chord such that the tangent at that point is parallel to the chord. The following proof illustrates this idea.\n\nDefine <math>g(x)=f(x)-rx</math> , where <math>r</math> is a constant. Since <math>f</math> is continuous on <math>[a,b]</math> and differentiable on <math>(a,b)</math> , the same is true for <math>g</math> . We now want to choose <math>r</math> so that <math>g</math> satisfies the conditions of [[Rolle's theorem]]. Namely\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}g(a)=g(b)&\\iff f(a)-ra=f(b)-rb\\\\ &\\iff r(b-a)=f(b)-f(a) \\\\&\\iff r=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\\cdot\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy [[Rolle's theorem]], since <math>g</math> is differentiable and <math>g(a)=g(b)</math> , there is some <math>c</math> in <math>(a,b)</math> for which <math>g'(c)=0</math> , and it follows from the equality <math>g(x)=f(x)-rx</math> that,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}&g'(x) = f'(x) -r \\\\& g'(c) = 0\\\\&g'(c) = f'(c) - r = 0 \\\\&\\Rightarrow f'(c) = r = \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \\end{align}\n</math>\n\n==A simple application==\nAssume that ''f'' is a continuous, real-valued function, defined on an arbitrary interval ''I'' of the real line. If the derivative of ''f'' at every [[interior (topology)|interior point]] of the interval ''I'' exists and is zero, then ''f'' is [[constant function|constant]] in the interior.\n\n'''Proof:''' Assume the derivative of ''f'' at every [[interior (topology)|interior point]] of the interval ''I'' exists and is zero. Let (''a'', ''b'') be an arbitrary open interval in ''I''. By the mean value theorem, there exists a point ''c'' in (''a'',''b'') such that\n\n:<math>0=f'(c)=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.</math>\n\nThis implies that ''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''b''). Thus, ''f'' is constant on the interior of ''I'' and thus is constant on ''I'' by continuity. (See below for a multivariable version of this result.)\n\n'''Remarks:''' \n* Only continuity of ''f'', not differentiability, is needed at the endpoints of the interval ''I''.  No hypothesis of continuity needs to be stated if ''I'' is an [[open interval]], since the existence of a derivative at a point implies the continuity at this point.  (See the section [[Derivative#Continuity and differentiability|continuity and differentiability]] of the article [[derivative]].)\n* The differentiability of ''f'' can be relaxed to [[one-sided derivatives|one-sided differentiability]], a proof given in the article on [[semi-differentiability]].\n\n==Cauchy's mean value theorem==<!-- This section is linked from [[Taylor's theorem]] -->\n'''Cauchy's mean value theorem''', also known as the '''extended mean value theorem''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExtendedMean-ValueTheorem.html|title=Extended Mean-Value Theorem|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref> is a generalization of the mean value theorem.

However Cauchy's theorem does not claim the existence of such a tangent in all cases where (''f''(''a''), ''g''(''a'')) and (''f''(''b''), ''g''(''b'')) are distinct points, since it might be satisfied only for some value ''c'' with {{nowrap|''f\u2032''(''c'') {{=}} ''g\u2032''(''c'') {{=}} 0}}, in other words a value for which the mentioned curve is [[Stationary point|stationary]]; in such points no tangent to the curve is likely to be defined at all. An example of this situation is the curve given by\n\n:<math>t\\mapsto(t^3,1-t^2),</math>\n\nwhich on the interval [\u22121, 1] goes from the point (\u22121, 0) to (1, 0), yet never has a horizontal tangent; however it has a stationary point (in fact a [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]]) at {{nowrap|''t'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nCauchy's mean value theorem can be used to prove [[l'H\u00f4pital's rule]]. The mean value theorem is the special case of Cauchy's mean value theorem when {{nowrap|''g''(''t'') {{=}} ''t''}}.\n\n===Proof of Cauchy's mean value theorem===\nThe proof of Cauchy's mean value theorem is based on the same idea as the proof of the mean value theorem.\n\n* Suppose ''g''(''a'') \u2260 ''g''(''b''). Define ''h''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u2212 ''rg''(''x''), where ''r'' is fixed in such a way that ''h''(''a'') = ''h''(''b''), namely\n:: <math>\\begin{align}h(a)=h(b)&\\iff f(a)-rg(a)=f(b)-rg(b)\\\\ &\\iff r (g(b)-g(a))=f(b)-f(a)\\\\ &\\iff r=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.\\end{align}</math>\n:Since ''f'' and ''g'' are continuous on [''a'', ''b''] and differentiable on (''a'', ''b''), the same is true for ''h''. All in all, ''h'' satisfies the conditions of [[Rolle's theorem]]: consequently, there is some ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') for which ''h\u2032''(''c'') = 0. Now using the definition of ''h'' we have:\n::<math>0=h'(c)=f'(c)-rg'(c) = f'(c)- \\left (\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} \\right ) g'(c).</math>\n:Therefore:\n::<math>f'(c)= \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} g'(c),</math>\n:which implies the result.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* If ''g''(''a'') = ''g''(''b''), then, applying [[Rolle's theorem]] to ''g'', it follows that there exists ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') for which ''g\u2032''(''c'') = 0. Using this choice of ''c'', Cauchy's mean value theorem (trivially) holds.\n\n==Generalization for determinants==\nAssume that <math>f, g,</math> and <math>h</math> are differentiable functions on <math>(a,b)</math> that are continuous on <math>[a,b]</math>. Define\n\n:<math> D(x)=\\left |\\begin{array}{ccc}f(x) & g(x)& h(x)\\\\ f(a) & g(a) & h(a)\\\\ f(b) & g(b)& h(b)\\end{array}\\right|</math>\n\nThere exists <math>c\\in(a,b)</math> such that <math> D'(c)=0</math>.\n\nNotice that\n:<math> D'(x)=\\left |\\begin{array}{ccc}f'(x) & g'(x)& h'(x)\\\\ f(a) & g(a) & h(a)\\\\ f(b) & g(b)& h(b)\\end{array}\\right|</math>\nand if we place <math>h(x)=1</math>, we get Cauchy's mean value theorem. If we place <math>h(x)=1</math> and <math>g(x)=x</math> we get '''Lagrange's mean value theorem'''.\n\nThe proof of the generalization is quite simple: each of <math>D(a)</math> and <math>D(b)</math> are determinants with two identical rows, hence <math>D(a)=D(b)=0</math>. The Rolle's theorem implies that there exists <math>c\\in (a,b)</math> such that <math>D'(c)=0</math>.\n\n== Mean value theorem in several variables ==\nThe mean value theorem generalizes to real functions of multiple variables. The trick is to use parametrization to create a real function of one variable, and then apply the one-variable theorem.\n\nLet <math>G</math> be an open convex subset of <math>\\R^n</math> , and let <math>f:G\\to\\R</math> be a differentiable function. Fix points <math>x,y\\in G</math> , and define <math>g(t)=f\\Big((1-t)x+ty\\Big)</math> . Since <math>g</math> is a differentiable function in one variable, the mean value theorem gives:\n\n:<math>g(1)-g(0)=g'(c)</math>\n\nfor some <math>c</math> between 0 and 1. But since <math>g(1)=f(y)</math> and <math>g(0)=f(x)</math> , computing <math>g'(c)</math> explicitly we have:\n\n:<math>f(y)-f(x)=\\nabla f\\Big((1-c)x+cy\\Big)\\cdot (y-x)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\nabla</math> denotes a [[gradient]] and <math>\\cdot</math> a [[dot product]]. Note that this is an exact analog of the theorem in one variable (in the case <math>n=1</math> this ''is'' the theorem in one variable). By the [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]], the equation gives the estimate:\n\n:<math>\\Bigg|f(y)-f(x)\\Bigg|\\le\\Bigg|\\nabla f\\Big((1-c)x+cy\\Big)\\Bigg|\\ \\Big|y - x\\Big|.</math>\n\nIn particular, when the partial derivatives of <math>f</math> are bounded, <math>f</math> is [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous]] (and therefore [[Uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]]). Note that <math>f</math> is not assumed to be continuously differentiable or continuous on the closure of <math>G</math> . However, in order to use the chain rule to compute <math> g' </math>, we really do need to know that <math>f</math> is differentiable on <math>G</math>; the existence of the <math> x </math> and <math> y </math> partial derivatives by itself is not sufficient for the theorem to be true {{clarify|date=March 2018| reason=Sufficient for what to be true?}}.\n\nAs an application of the above, we prove that <math>f</math> is constant if <math>G</math> is open and connected and every partial derivative of <math>f</math> is 0. Pick some point <math>x_0\\in G</math> , and let <math>g(x)=f(x)-f(x_0)</math> . We want to show <math>g(x)=0</math> for every <math>x\\in G</math> . For that, let <math>E=\\{x\\in G:g(x)=0\\}</math> . Then ''E'' is closed and nonempty. It is open too: for every <math>x\\in E</math> ,\n\n:<math>\\Big|g(y)\\Big|=\\Bigg|g(y)-g(x)\\Bigg|\\le (0)\\Big|y-x\\Big|=0</math>\n\nfor every <math>y</math> in some neighborhood of <math>x</math> . (Here, it is crucial that <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are sufficiently close to each other.) Since <math>G</math> is connected, we conclude <math>E=G</math> .\n\nThe above arguments are made in a coordinate-free manner; hence, they generalize to the case when <math>G</math> is a subset of a Banach space.\n\n== Mean value theorem for vector-valued functions ==\nThere is no exact analog of the mean value theorem for vector-valued functions.\n\nIn ''Principles of Mathematical Analysis,'' [[Walter Rudin|Rudin]] gives an inequality which can be applied to many of the same situations to which the mean value theorem is applicable in the one dimensional case:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis (3rd ed.)|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=978-0-07-054235-8|location=New York|pages=113|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n'''Theorem.'''  ''For a continuous vector-valued function <math>\\mathbf{f}:[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}^k</math> differentiable on <math>(a,b)</math>, there exists <math>x\\in(a,b)</math> such that <math>|\\mathbf{f}'(x)|\\geq\\frac{1}{b-a}|\\mathbf{f}(b)-\\mathbf{f}(a)| </math>.''\n\n[[Jean Dieudonn\u00e9]] in his classic treatise ''Foundations of Modern Analysis'' discards the mean value theorem and replaces it by mean inequality as the proof is not constructive and one cannot find the mean value and in applications one only needs mean inequality. [[Serge Lang]] in ''Analysis I ''uses the mean value theorem, in integral form, as an instant reflex but this use requires the continuity of the derivative. If one uses the [[Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral]] one can have the mean value theorem in integral form without the additional assumption that derivative should be continuous as every derivative is Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integrable. The problem is roughly speaking the following: If ''f'' : ''U'' \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> is a differentiable function (where ''U'' \u2282 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is open) and if ''x'' + ''th'', ''x, h'' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, ''t'' \u2208 [0, 1] is the line segment in question (lying inside ''U''), then one can apply the above parametrization procedure to each of the component functions ''f<sub>i</sub>'' (''i'' = 1, ..., ''m'') of ''f'' (in the above notation set ''y'' = ''x'' + ''h''). In doing so one finds points ''x'' + ''t<sub>i</sub>h'' on the line segment satisfying\n\n:<math>f_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \\nabla f_i (x + t_ih) \\cdot h.</math>\n\nBut generally there will not be a ''single'' point ''x'' + ''t*h'' on the line segment satisfying\n\n:<math>f_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \\nabla f_i (x + t^* h) \\cdot h.</math>\n\nfor all ''i'' ''simultaneously''. For example, define:\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} f : [0, 2 \\pi] \\to \\mathbf{R}^2 \\\\ f(x) = (\\cos(x), \\sin(x)) \\end{cases}</math>\n\nThen <math>f(2\\pi) - f(0) = \\mathbf{0} \\in \\mathbf{R}^2</math>, but <math>f_1'(x)=-\\sin (x)</math> and <math>f_2'(x)=\\cos (x)</math> are never simultaneously zero as <math>x</math> ranges over <math>\\left[0, 2 \\pi\\right]</math>.\n\nHowever a certain type of generalization of the mean value theorem to vector-valued functions is obtained as follows: Let ''f'' be a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on an open interval ''I'', and let ''x'' as well as ''x'' + ''h'' be points of ''I''. The mean value theorem in one variable tells us that there exists some ''t*'' between 0 and 1 such that\n\n:<math>f(x+h)-f(x) = f'(x+t^*h)\\cdot h.</math>\n\nOn the other hand, we have, by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] followed by a change of variables,\n\n:<math> f(x+h)-f(x) = \\int_x^{x+h} f'(u) \\, du = \\left (\\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\\,dt\\right)\\cdot h.</math>\n\nThus, the value ''f\u2032''(''x'' + ''t*h'') at the particular point ''t*'' has been replaced by the mean value\n\n:<math>\\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\\,dt.</math>\n\nThis last version can be generalized to vector valued functions:\n\n:'''Lemma 1.''' Let ''U'' \u2282 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> be open, ''f'' : ''U'' \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> continuously differentiable, and ''x'' \u2208 ''U'', ''h'' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> vectors such that the line segment ''x'' + ''th'',  0 \u2264 ''t'' \u2264 1 remains in ''U''. Then we have:\n::<math>f(x+h)-f(x) = \\left (\\int_0^1 Df(x+th)\\,dt\\right)\\cdot h,</math>\n:where ''Df'' denotes the [[Jacobian matrix]] of ''f'' and the integral of a matrix is to be understood componentwise.\n\n'''Proof.'''

If the derivative of ''f'' at every [[interior (topology)|interior point]] of the interval ''I'' exists and is zero, then ''f'' is [[constant function|constant]] in the interior.\n\n'''Proof:''' Assume the derivative of ''f'' at every [[interior (topology)|interior point]] of the interval ''I'' exists and is zero.

(See below for a multivariable version of this result.)\n\n'''Remarks:''' \n* Only continuity of ''f'', not differentiability, is needed at the endpoints of the interval ''I''.  No hypothesis of continuity needs to be stated if ''I'' is an [[open interval]], since the existence of a derivative at a point implies the continuity at this point.

However Cauchy's theorem does not claim the existence of such a tangent in all cases where (''f''(''a''), ''g''(''a'')) and (''f''(''b''), ''g''(''b'')) are distinct points, since it might be satisfied only for some value ''c'' with {{nowrap|''f\u2032''(''c'') {{=}} ''g\u2032''(''c'') {{=}} 0}}, in other words a value for which the mentioned curve is [[Stationary point|stationary]]; in such points no tangent to the curve is likely to be defined at all. An example of this situation is the curve given by\n\n:<math>t\\mapsto(t^3,1-t^2),</math>\n\nwhich on the interval [\u22121, 1] goes from the point (\u22121, 0) to (1, 0), yet never has a horizontal tangent; however it has a stationary point (in fact a [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]]) at {{nowrap|''t'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nCauchy's mean value theorem can be used to prove [[l'H\u00f4pital's rule]]. The mean value theorem is the special case of Cauchy's mean value theorem when {{nowrap|''g''(''t'') {{=}} ''t''}}.\n\n===Proof of Cauchy's mean value theorem===\nThe proof of Cauchy's mean value theorem is based on the same idea as the proof of the mean value theorem.\n\n* Suppose ''g''(''a'') \u2260 ''g''(''b''). Define ''h''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u2212 ''rg''(''x''), where ''r'' is fixed in such a way that ''h''(''a'') = ''h''(''b''), namely\n:: <math>\\begin{align}h(a)=h(b)&\\iff f(a)-rg(a)=f(b)-rg(b)\\\\ &\\iff r (g(b)-g(a))=f(b)-f(a)\\\\ &\\iff r=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.\\end{align}</math>\n:Since ''f'' and ''g'' are continuous on [''a'', ''b''] and differentiable on (''a'', ''b''), the same is true for ''h''. All in all, ''h'' satisfies the conditions of [[Rolle's theorem]]: consequently, there is some ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') for which ''h\u2032''(''c'') = 0. Now using the definition of ''h'' we have:\n::<math>0=h'(c)=f'(c)-rg'(c) = f'(c)- \\left (\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} \\right ) g'(c).</math>\n:Therefore:\n::<math>f'(c)= \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} g'(c),</math>\n:which implies the result.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* If ''g''(''a'') = ''g''(''b''), then, applying [[Rolle's theorem]] to ''g'', it follows that there exists ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') for which ''g\u2032''(''c'') = 0. Using this choice of ''c'', Cauchy's mean value theorem (trivially) holds.\n\n==Generalization for determinants==\nAssume that <math>f, g,</math> and <math>h</math> are differentiable functions on <math>(a,b)</math> that are continuous on <math>[a,b]</math>. Define\n\n:<math> D(x)=\\left |\\begin{array}{ccc}f(x) & g(x)& h(x)\\\\ f(a) & g(a) & h(a)\\\\ f(b) & g(b)& h(b)\\end{array}\\right|</math>\n\nThere exists <math>c\\in(a,b)</math> such that <math> D'(c)=0</math>.\n\nNotice that\n:<math> D'(x)=\\left |\\begin{array}{ccc}f'(x) & g'(x)& h'(x)\\\\ f(a) & g(a) & h(a)\\\\ f(b) & g(b)& h(b)\\end{array}\\right|</math>\nand if we place <math>h(x)=1</math>, we get Cauchy's mean value theorem. If we place <math>h(x)=1</math> and <math>g(x)=x</math> we get '''Lagrange's mean value theorem'''.\n\nThe proof of the generalization is quite simple: each of <math>D(a)</math> and <math>D(b)</math> are determinants with two identical rows, hence <math>D(a)=D(b)=0</math>. The Rolle's theorem implies that there exists <math>c\\in (a,b)</math> such that <math>D'(c)=0</math>.\n\n== Mean value theorem in several variables ==\nThe mean value theorem generalizes to real functions of multiple variables. The trick is to use parametrization to create a real function of one variable, and then apply the one-variable theorem.\n\nLet <math>G</math> be an open convex subset of <math>\\R^n</math> , and let <math>f:G\\to\\R</math> be a differentiable function. Fix points <math>x,y\\in G</math> , and define <math>g(t)=f\\Big((1-t)x+ty\\Big)</math> . Since <math>g</math> is a differentiable function in one variable, the mean value theorem gives:\n\n:<math>g(1)-g(0)=g'(c)</math>\n\nfor some <math>c</math> between 0 and 1. But since <math>g(1)=f(y)</math> and <math>g(0)=f(x)</math> , computing <math>g'(c)</math> explicitly we have:\n\n:<math>f(y)-f(x)=\\nabla f\\Big((1-c)x+cy\\Big)\\cdot (y-x)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\nabla</math> denotes a [[gradient]] and <math>\\cdot</math> a [[dot product]]. Note that this is an exact analog of the theorem in one variable (in the case <math>n=1</math> this ''is'' the theorem in one variable). By the [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]], the equation gives the estimate:\n\n:<math>\\Bigg|f(y)-f(x)\\Bigg|\\le\\Bigg|\\nabla f\\Big((1-c)x+cy\\Big)\\Bigg|\\ \\Big|y - x\\Big|.</math>\n\nIn particular, when the partial derivatives of <math>f</math> are bounded, <math>f</math> is [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous]] (and therefore [[Uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]]). Note that <math>f</math> is not assumed to be continuously differentiable or continuous on the closure of <math>G</math> . However, in order to use the chain rule to compute <math> g' </math>, we really do need to know that <math>f</math> is differentiable on <math>G</math>; the existence of the <math> x </math> and <math> y </math> partial derivatives by itself is not sufficient for the theorem to be true {{clarify|date=March 2018| reason=Sufficient for what to be true?}}.\n\nAs an application of the above, we prove that <math>f</math> is constant if <math>G</math> is open and connected and every partial derivative of <math>f</math> is 0. Pick some point <math>x_0\\in G</math> , and let <math>g(x)=f(x)-f(x_0)</math> . We want to show <math>g(x)=0</math> for every <math>x\\in G</math> .

(Here, it is crucial that <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are sufficiently close to each other.) Since <math>G</math> is connected, we conclude <math>E=G</math> .\n\nThe above arguments are made in a coordinate-free manner; hence, they generalize to the case when <math>G</math> is a subset of a Banach space.\n\n== Mean value theorem for vector-valued functions ==\nThere is no exact analog of the mean value theorem for vector-valued functions.\n\nIn ''Principles of Mathematical Analysis,'' [[Walter Rudin|Rudin]] gives an inequality which can be applied to many of the same situations to which the mean value theorem is applicable in the one dimensional case:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis (3rd ed.)|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=978-0-07-054235-8|location=New York|pages=113|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n'''Theorem.'''  ''For a continuous vector-valued function <math>\\mathbf{f}:[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}^k</math> differentiable on <math>(a,b)</math>, there exists <math>x\\in(a,b)</math> such that <math>|\\mathbf{f}'(x)|\\geq\\frac{1}{b-a}|\\mathbf{f}(b)-\\mathbf{f}(a)| </math>.''\n\n[[Jean Dieudonn\u00e9]] in his classic treatise ''Foundations of Modern Analysis'' discards the mean value theorem and replaces it by mean inequality as the proof is not constructive and one cannot find the mean value and in applications one only needs mean inequality. [[Serge Lang]] in ''Analysis I ''uses the mean value theorem, in integral form, as an instant reflex but this use requires the continuity of the derivative. If one uses the [[Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral]] one can have the mean value theorem in integral form without the additional assumption that derivative should be continuous as every derivative is Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integrable. The problem is roughly speaking the following: If ''f'' : ''U'' \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> is a differentiable function (where ''U'' \u2282 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is open) and if ''x'' + ''th'', ''x, h'' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, ''t'' \u2208 [0, 1] is the line segment in question (lying inside ''U''), then one can apply the above parametrization procedure to each of the component functions ''f<sub>i</sub>'' (''i'' = 1, ..., ''m'') of ''f'' (in the above notation set ''y'' = ''x'' + ''h''). In doing so one finds points ''x'' + ''t<sub>i</sub>h'' on the line segment satisfying\n\n:<math>f_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \\nabla f_i (x + t_ih) \\cdot h.</math>\n\nBut generally there will not be a ''single'' point ''x'' + ''t*h'' on the line segment satisfying\n\n:<math>f_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \\nabla f_i (x + t^* h) \\cdot h.</math>\n\nfor all ''i'' ''simultaneously''. For example, define:\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} f : [0, 2 \\pi] \\to \\mathbf{R}^2 \\\\ f(x) = (\\cos(x), \\sin(x)) \\end{cases}</math>\n\nThen <math>f(2\\pi) - f(0) = \\mathbf{0} \\in \\mathbf{R}^2</math>, but <math>f_1'(x)=-\\sin (x)</math> and <math>f_2'(x)=\\cos (x)</math> are never simultaneously zero as <math>x</math> ranges over <math>\\left[0, 2 \\pi\\right]</math>.\n\nHowever a certain type of generalization of the mean value theorem to vector-valued functions is obtained as follows: Let ''f'' be a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on an open interval ''I'', and let ''x'' as well as ''x'' + ''h'' be points of ''I''. The mean value theorem in one variable tells us that there exists some ''t*'' between 0 and 1 such that\n\n:<math>f(x+h)-f(x) = f'(x+t^*h)\\cdot h.</math>\n\nOn the other hand, we have, by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] followed by a change of variables,\n\n:<math> f(x+h)-f(x) = \\int_x^{x+h} f'(u) \\, du = \\left (\\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\\,dt\\right)\\cdot h.</math>\n\nThus, the value ''f\u2032''(''x'' + ''t*h'') at the particular point ''t*'' has been replaced by the mean value\n\n:<math>\\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\\,dt.</math>\n\nThis last version can be generalized to vector valued functions:\n\n:'''Lemma 1.''' Let ''U'' \u2282 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> be open, ''f'' : ''U'' \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> continuously differentiable, and ''x'' \u2208 ''U'', ''h'' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> vectors such that the line segment ''x'' + ''th'',  0 \u2264 ''t'' \u2264 1 remains in ''U''. Then we have:\n::<math>f(x+h)-f(x) = \\left (\\int_0^1 Df(x+th)\\,dt\\right)\\cdot h,</math>\n:where ''Df'' denotes the [[Jacobian matrix]] of ''f'' and the integral of a matrix is to be understood componentwise.\n\n'''Proof.''' Let ''f''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''f<sub>m</sub>'' denote the components of ''f'' and define:\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} g_i : [0,1] \\to \\mathbf{R} \\\\ g_i(t) = f_i (x +th) \\end{cases} </math>\n\nThen we have\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& f_i(x+h)-f_i(x) = g_i(1)-g_i(0) =\\int_0^1 g_i'(t)\\,dt \\\\\n= {} & \\int_0^1 \\left (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j} (x+th)h_j\\right)\\,dt = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left (\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}(x+th)\\,dt\\right)h_j.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe claim follows since ''Df'' is the matrix consisting of the components <math>\\tfrac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}.</math>\n\n:'''Lemma 2.''' Let ''v'' : [''a'', ''b''] \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> be a continuous function defined on the interval [''a'', ''b''] \u2282 '''R'''. Then we have\n::<math>\\left \\|\\int_a^b v(t)\\,dt\\right\\|\\leqslant \\int_a^b \\|v(t)\\|\\,dt.</math>\n\n'''Proof.''' Let ''u'' in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> denote the value of the integral\n:<math>u:=\\int_a^b v(t)\\,dt.</math>\nNow we have (using the [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]]):\n:<math>\\|u\\|^2 = \\langle u,u \\rangle =\\left \\langle \\int_a^b v(t) \\, dt, u \\right\\rangle = \\int_a^b \\langle v(t),u \\rangle \\,dt \\leqslant \\int_a^b \\| v(t) \\|\\cdot \\|u \\|\\,dt = \\|u\\| \\int_a^b \\|v(t)\\|\\,dt</math>\nNow cancelling the norm of ''u'' from both ends gives us the desired inequality.\n\n:'''Mean Value Inequality.'''

It is operated by the [[Norwegian State Railways]] (NSB) with nine [[NSB Class 72|Class 72]] [[electric multiple unit]]s. The service acts as a commuter rail connecting [[Stavanger]] to its suburbs, including [[Sandnes]], and to towns further south, in [[Klepp]], [[Time, Norway|Time]], [[H\u00e5]] and [[Eigersund]]. Although passenger services have operated along the lines since 1878, the commuter train service was inaugurated in 1992 with a significant increase of service, using existing rolling stock. The system has an annual ridership of 2.5 million passengers to date.\n\nThe service runs from [[Stavanger Station]] to [[Egersund Station]], a distance of {{convert|75|km|sp=us}}. It has four hourly services from Stavanger to [[Sandnes Station]], of which two continue to [[N\u00e6rb\u00f8 Station]] and one to Egersund. The section from Stavanger to Sandnes is [[double track]], while the rest is [[single track (rail)|single track]]. The infrastructure is owned by the [[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] and the line is also used by intercity and freight trains. Several proposed upgrades to the system have been made, such as a branch along the [[\u00c5lg\u00e5rd Line]], a branch to [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]] and reestablishing double track from Sandnes to Egersund.\n\n==Route==\n{{main|J\u00e6ren Line}}\n[[File:Gausel holdeplass.JPG|thumb|left|[[Gausel Station]] is one of the three new stations that opened in 2009]]\n{{J\u00e6ren Commuter Rail map}}\n\nThe commuter rail service runs along the full length of the J\u00e6ren Line, the old name of the section of the S\u00f8rland Line from Stavanger to Egersund. The line is [[standard gauge]], [[railway electrification system|electrified]] at {{15 kV AC}} and owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The line starts as [[double track]] at [[Stavanger Station]], which is located in the central business district of [[Stavanger]] and is the terminal station of the S\u00f8rland Line.

Plans call for stations at [[Vagle]], Figgjo, [[Kongeparken]] and \u00c5lg\u00e5rd. It is possible to operate the trains that currently terminate at Sandnes to \u00c5lg\u00e5rd without new infrastructure investments to the S\u00f8rland Line. However, the line would need a full upgrade, including new tracks, electric system and signaling. \u00c5lg\u00e5rd is also a good location for a [[park and ride]] for [[European route E39|European Route E39]].<ref name=algard />\n\nA branch to Sola has been considered to allow the trains to operate to [[Sola]] and the airport. The line would branch from the S\u00f8rland Line south of Gausel, and be built so trains from the branch could run both northwards and southwards. Proposed stations include the airport, [[Solakrossen]], [[Forus]] West, [[Statoil]]'s head office and possibly the shopping center [[Kvadrat (shopping centre)|Kvadrat]]. This would give a travel time of 17 minutes from the airport to the city center, and 10 minutes from the airport to Sandnes. This route has, however, also been proposed as part of the light rail system. It would give about 2.5 million annual passengers.<ref name=sola />\n\n[[File:J\u00e5tt\u00e5v\u00e5gen holdeplass.JPG|thumb|left|[[J\u00e5tt\u00e5v\u00e5gen Station]] opened in 2009 along the new double track section]]\nPlans have been made that would either double or triple the frequency on all the services on the existing commuter rail network. However, increased frequency south of Sandnes will require double track. Should the frequency be doubled, double track would have to be built to where the current service to N\u00e6rb\u00f8 terminates. Plans call for these trains to possibly be extended to either Varhaug or Vigrestad. Should the frequency be tripled, double track would be needed all the way to Egersund. Parts of the J\u00e6ren Line is straight enough to permit speeds between {{convert|200|and|250|km/h|sp=us}}. However, several shorter parts need to be rebuilt to allow this, particularly between Egersund and Ogna, and from Bryne to Ganddal. In particular, the section from Ogna to Egersund would probably have to follow an all-new route, should it be rebuilt to double track. The effect of higher maximum speeds is greatest for intercity trains, as the commuter trains have so frequent stops they have little to gain from the increased speeds.<ref name=longerdouble />\n\nWhen the J\u00e6ren Line was built, the station in Egersund was located in the city center. With the opening of the S\u00f8rland Line, the station was moved {{convert|1|km}} north of the city center. [[Egersund Station]] has been proposed moved back to its old location for the commuter rail, giving Egersund two stations: one for commuter trains and one for regional trains. The right-of-way still exists for this route, making construction easy. A new S\u00f8rland Line has also been proposed, which would run south instead of north from Egersund. This would mean that a city center location for Egersund Station would be better for intercity trains as well.<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 61</ref>\n\nRogaland County Municipality is in the planning process of building a light rail in Greater Stavanger. The initial plans call for a Y-shaped service which could be operational by 2018, with possibilities for further expansion. As of 2010, the plans call for a {{convert|16.2|km}} line from Stavanger to Sandnes, and a {{convert|7.7|or|8.8|km}} branch to the airport. The travel time from Sandnes to Stavanger would be 29 minutes, and is therefore a supplement to the commuter rail. The light rail would have interchange with the light rail at Stavanger, Paradis, J\u00e5tt\u00e5v\u00e5gen, Gausel and Sandnes Sentrum. Several new branches of the light rail have been proposed for later construction.<ref name=lightrail />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{commons category|J\u00e6rbanen}}\n* {{cite book |title=Glemte spor: boken om sidebanenes tragiske liv |last=Aspenberg |first=Nils Carl |authorlink=Nils Carl Aspenberg |year=1994 |publisher=Baneforlaget |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |isbn=82-91448-00-0}}\n* {{Cite book|first=Nils Carl |last=Aspenberg |authorlink=Nils Carl Aspenberg |title=Elektrolok i Norge |year=2001 |publisher=Baneforlaget |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |isbn=82-91448-42-6}}\n* {{cite book |title=Banelangs: \u00c5lg\u00e5rdbanen gjennom 75 \u00e5r |last=Thume |first=Torkel |year=1999 |publisher=State Archive in Stavanger |location=Stavanger |language=Norwegian |isbn=82-91794-06-5}}\n* {{cite web |title=Utbyggingsplan J\u00e6rbanen |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/PageFiles/9467/Utviklingsplan%20J\u00e6rbanen.pdf |author=[[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] |year=2009a |language=Norwegian |accessdate=8 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825195134/http://www.jernbaneverket.no/PageFiles/9467/Utviklingsplan%20J%C3%A6rbanen.pdf |archivedate=25 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}\n* {{cite web |title=Railway Statistics 2008 |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/PageFiles/7894/Jernbanestatistikk%202008_22%20juni_web.pdf |author=[[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] |year=2009b |accessdate=8 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122071524/http://www.jernbaneverket.no/PageFiles/7894/Jernbanestatistikk%202008_22%20juni_web.pdf |archivedate=22 November 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}\n\n{{Urban rail systems in Norway}}\n{{J\u00e6ren Commuter Rail}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jaeren Commuter Rail}}\n[[Category:Norwegian State Railways]]\n[[Category:Public transport in Rogaland]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Rogaland]]\n[[Category:Commuter rail systems in Norway]]\n[[Category:S\u00f8rlandet Line]]\n[[Category:1992 establishments in Norway]]\n[[Category:Railway services introduced in 1992]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2012}}\n{{good article}}\n{{Infobox Public transit\n|name            = J\u00e6ren Commuter Rail\n|image           = Sandnes stasjon.jpg\n|imagesize       = 300px\n|locale          = [[J\u00e6ren]], [[Norway]]\n|transit_type    = [[Commuter rail]]\n|began_operation = January 1, 1992 (first section opened on March 1, 1878)\n|ended_operation =\n|system_length   = {{convert|75|km|abbr=on}}\n|lines           = 1\n|vehicles        = 9 [[NSB Class 72|Class 72]]\n|stations        = 19\n|ridership       =\n|track_gauge     = {{RailGauge|sg}}\n|reporting marks =\n|operator        = [[Norwegian State Railways]]\n|owner           = [[Norwegian National Rail Administration]]\n}}\n\nThe '''J\u00e6ren Commuter Rail''' ({{lang-no|NSB Lokaltog J\u00e6ren}}, previously {{lang|no|J\u00e6rbanen}}) is a [[commuter train]] service operated along the westernmost part of the [[S\u00f8rland Line]] in [[J\u00e6ren]], [[Norway]]. It is operated by the [[Norwegian State Railways]] (NSB) with nine [[NSB Class 72|Class 72]] [[electric multiple unit]]s. The service acts as a commuter rail connecting [[Stavanger]] to its suburbs, including [[Sandnes]], and to towns further south, in [[Klepp]], [[Time, Norway|Time]], [[H\u00e5]] and [[Eigersund]]. Although passenger services have operated along the lines since 1878, the commuter train service was inaugurated in 1992 with a significant increase of service, using existing rolling stock. The system has an annual ridership of 2.5 million passengers to date.\n\nThe service runs from [[Stavanger Station]] to [[Egersund Station]], a distance of {{convert|75|km|sp=us}}. It has four hourly services from Stavanger to [[Sandnes Station]], of which two continue to [[N\u00e6rb\u00f8 Station]] and one to Egersund. The section from Stavanger to Sandnes is [[double track]], while the rest is [[single track (rail)|single track]]. The infrastructure is owned by the [[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] and the line is also used by intercity and freight trains. Several proposed upgrades to the system have been made, such as a branch along the [[\u00c5lg\u00e5rd Line]], a branch to [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]] and reestablishing double track from Sandnes to Egersund.\n\n==Route==\n{{main|J\u00e6ren Line}}\n[[File:Gausel holdeplass.JPG|thumb|left|[[Gausel Station]] is one of the three new stations that opened in 2009]]\n{{J\u00e6ren Commuter Rail map}}\n\nThe commuter rail service runs along the full length of the J\u00e6ren Line, the old name of the section of the S\u00f8rland Line from Stavanger to Egersund.

Proposed stations include the airport, [[Solakrossen]], [[Forus]] West, [[Statoil]]'s head office and possibly the shopping center [[Kvadrat (shopping centre)|Kvadrat]]. This would give a travel time of 17 minutes from the airport to the city center, and 10 minutes from the airport to Sandnes.

However, increased frequency south of Sandnes will require double track. Should the frequency be doubled, double track would have to be built to where the current service to N\u00e6rb\u00f8 terminates. Plans call for these trains to possibly be extended to either Varhaug or Vigrestad. Should the frequency be tripled, double track would be needed all the way to Egersund.

However, several shorter parts need to be rebuilt to allow this, particularly between Egersund and Ogna, and from Bryne to Ganddal. In particular, the section from Ogna to Egersund would probably have to follow an all-new route, should it be rebuilt to double track. The effect of higher maximum speeds is greatest for intercity trains, as the commuter trains have so frequent stops they have little to gain from the increased speeds.<ref name=longerdouble />\n\nWhen the J\u00e6ren Line was built, the station in Egersund was located in the city center.

[[Egersund Station]] has been proposed moved back to its old location for the commuter rail, giving Egersund two stations: one for commuter trains and one for regional trains. The right-of-way still exists for this route, making construction easy. A new S\u00f8rland Line has also been proposed, which would run south instead of north from Egersund. This would mean that a city center location for Egersund Station would be better for intercity trains as well.<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 61</ref>\n\nRogaland County Municipality is in the planning process of building a light rail in Greater Stavanger.

The travel time from Sandnes to Stavanger would be 29 minutes, and is therefore a supplement to the commuter rail. The light rail would have interchange with the light rail at Stavanger, Paradis, J\u00e5tt\u00e5v\u00e5gen, Gausel and Sandnes Sentrum.

{"title_page": "Electrical reactance", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Reactance (physics)||Reactance (disambiguation){{!}}Reactance}}\nIn electric and electronic systems, '''reactance''' is the opposition of a [[circuit element]] to the flow of [[electric current|current]] due to that element's [[inductance]] or [[capacitance]]. Larger reactance leads to smaller currents for the same voltage applied. Reactance is similar to [[electric resistance]], but it differs in several respects.\n\nReactance is used to compute amplitude and phase changes of [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] [[alternating current]] going through a circuit element. It is denoted by the symbol <math>\\scriptstyle{X}</math>. An ideal [[resistor]] has zero reactance, whereas ideal [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s have zero resistance &ndash; that is, respond to current only by reactance. As frequency goes up, inductive reactance also goes up and capacitive reactance goes down.\n\n== Comparison to resistance ==\nReactance is similar to resistance in that larger reactance leads to smaller currents for the same applied voltage. Further, a circuit made entirely of elements that have only reactance (and no resistance) can be treated the same way as a circuit made entirely of elements with no reactance (pure resistance). These same techniques can also be used to combine elements with reactance with elements with resistance but [[complex numbers]] are typically needed. This is treated below in the section on [[electrical impedance|impedance]].\n\nThere are several important differences between reactance and resistance, though. First, reactance changes the phase so that the current through the element is shifted by a quarter of a cycle relative to the voltage applied across the element. Second, power is not dissipated in a purely reactive element but is stored instead. Third, reactances can be negative so that they can 'cancel' each other out. Finally, the main circuit elements that have reactance (capacitors and inductors) have a frequency dependent reactance, unlike resistors which typically have the same resistance for all frequencies.\n\n== Capacitive reactance ==\n\n{{main|Capacitance}}\nA capacitor consists of two [[Electric conduction|conductor]]s separated by an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], also known as a [[dielectric]].\n\n''Capacitive reactance'' is an opposition to the change of voltage across an element. Capacitive reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X_C}</math> is [[inversely proportional]] to the signal [[frequency]] <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> (or [[angular frequency]] \u03c9) and the [[capacitance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{C}</math>.<ref name=\"Irwin\">Irwin, D. (2002). ''Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis'', page 274. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</ref>\n\nThere are two choices in the literature for defining reactance for a capacitor. One is to use a uniform notion of reactance as the imaginary part of impedance, in which case the reactance of a capacitor is the negative number,<ref name=\"Irwin\"/><ref>Hayt, W.H., Kimmerly J.E.

''Introduction to Circuit Analysis and Design'', Springer, p. 408</ref>\n\n:<math>X_C = -\\frac {1} {\\omega C} = -\\frac {1} {2\\pi f C}</math>\n\nand this is also the value quoted in IEC 60050.\n\nAnother choice is to define capacitive reactance as a positive number,<ref>Horowitz P., Hill W. (2015). ''[[The Art of Electronics]]'', 3rd ed., p. 42</reF><ref name=\"Hughes\">Hughes E., Hiley J., Brown K., Smith I.McK., (2012).

When the [[potential]] associated with the charge exactly balances the applied voltage, the current goes to zero.\n\nDriven by an AC supply (ideal AC current source), a capacitor will only accumulate a limited amount of charge before the potential difference changes polarity and the charge is returned to the source.  The higher the frequency, the less charge will accumulate and the smaller the opposition to the current.\n\n== Inductive reactance ==\n{{main|Inductance}}\n\nInductive reactance is a property exhibited by an inductor, and inductive reactance exists based on the fact that an electric current produces a magnetic field around it. In the context of an AC circuit (although this concept applies any time current is changing), this magnetic field is constantly changing as a result of current that oscillates back and forth. It is this change in magnetic field that induces another electric current to flow in the same wire (counter-EMF), in a direction such as to oppose the flow of the current originally responsible for producing the magnetic field (known as Lenz's Law). Hence, ''inductive reactance'' is an opposition to the change of current through an element. \n\nFor an ideal inductor in an AC circuit, the inhibitive effect on change in current flow results in a delay, or a phase shift, of the alternating current with respect to alternating voltage. Specifically, an ideal inductor (with no resistance) will cause the current to lag the voltage by a quarter cycle, or 90\u00b0. \n\nIn electric power systems, inductive reactance (and capacitive reactance, however inductive reactance is more common) can limit the power capacity of an AC transmission line, because power is not completely transferred when voltage and current are out-of-phase (detailed above). That is, current will flow for an out-of-phase system, however real power at certain times will not be transferred, because there will be points during which instantaneous current is positive while instantaneous voltage is negative, or vice versa, implying negative power transfer. Hence, real work is not performed when power transfer is \"negative\". However, current still flows even when a system is out-of-phase, which causes transmission lines to heat up due to current flow. Consequently, transmission lines can only heat up so much (or else they would physically sag too much, due to the heat expanding the metal transmission lines), so transmission line operators have a \"ceiling\" on the amount of current that can flow through a given line, and excessive inductive reactance can limit the power capacity of a line. Power providers utilize capacitors to shift the phase and minimize the losses, based on usage patterns.\n\nInductive reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X_L}</math> is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the sinusoidal signal [[frequency]] <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> and the [[inductance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{L}</math>, which depends on the physical shape of the inductor.\n:<math>X_L = \\omega L = 2\\pi f L</math>\n\nThe average current flowing through an [[inductance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{L}</math> in series with a [[sinusoidal]] AC voltage source of RMS [[amplitude]] <math>\\scriptstyle{A}</math> and frequency <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> is equal to:\n:<math>I_L = {A \\over \\omega L} = {A \\over 2\\pi f L}.</math>\n\nBecause a [[square wave]] has multiple amplitudes at sinusoidal [[harmonic]]s, the average current flowing through an [[inductance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{L}</math> in series with a square wave AC voltage source of RMS [[amplitude]] <math>\\scriptstyle{A}</math> and frequency <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> is equal to:\n:<math>I_L = {A \\pi^2 \\over 8 \\omega L} = {A\\pi \\over 16 f L}</math>\nmaking it appear as if the inductive reactance to a square wave was about 19% smaller <math>X_L = {16 \\over \\pi} f L</math>  than the reactance to the AC sine wave:\n\nAny conductor of finite dimensions has inductance; the inductance is made larger by the multiple turns in an [[electromagnetic coil]].

A constant [[direct current]] has a zero rate-of-change, and sees an inductor as a [[short-circuit]] (it is typically made from a material with a low [[resistivity]]).  An [[alternating current]] has a time-averaged rate-of-change  that is proportional to frequency, this causes the increase in inductive reactance with frequency.\n\n== Impedance ==\n{{main|Electrical impedance}}\nBoth reactance <math>{X}</math> and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] <math>{R}</math> are components of [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] <math>{\\mathbf{Z}}</math>.\n:<math>\\mathbf{Z} = R + \\mathbf{j}X</math>\nwhere:\n*<math>\\mathbf{Z}</math> is the complex [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], measured in [[ohm]]s;\n*<math>R</math> is the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], measured in ohms.

Larger reactance leads to smaller currents for the same voltage applied. Reactance is similar to [[electric resistance]], but it differs in several respects.\n\nReactance is used to compute amplitude and phase changes of [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] [[alternating current]] going through a circuit element. It is denoted by the symbol <math>\\scriptstyle{X}</math>. An ideal [[resistor]] has zero reactance, whereas ideal [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s have zero resistance &ndash; that is, respond to current only by reactance. As frequency goes up, inductive reactance also goes up and capacitive reactance goes down.\n\n== Comparison to resistance ==\nReactance is similar to resistance in that larger reactance leads to smaller currents for the same applied voltage. Further, a circuit made entirely of elements that have only reactance (and no resistance) can be treated the same way as a circuit made entirely of elements with no reactance (pure resistance). These same techniques can also be used to combine elements with reactance with elements with resistance but [[complex numbers]] are typically needed. This is treated below in the section on [[electrical impedance|impedance]].\n\nThere are several important differences between reactance and resistance, though. First, reactance changes the phase so that the current through the element is shifted by a quarter of a cycle relative to the voltage applied across the element. Second, power is not dissipated in a purely reactive element but is stored instead. Third, reactances can be negative so that they can 'cancel' each other out. Finally, the main circuit elements that have reactance (capacitors and inductors) have a frequency dependent reactance, unlike resistors which typically have the same resistance for all frequencies.\n\n== Capacitive reactance ==\n\n{{main|Capacitance}}\nA capacitor consists of two [[Electric conduction|conductor]]s separated by an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], also known as a [[dielectric]].\n\n''Capacitive reactance'' is an opposition to the change of voltage across an element.

The term is generally specific to Japanese anime, however, it can occasionally include American animation footage or video game footage. AMVs are not official music videos released by the musicians, they are fan compositions which synchronize edited video clips with an audio track. AMVs are most commonly posted and distributed over the Internet through AnimeMusicVideos.org or [[YouTube]]. [[Anime convention]]s frequently run AMV contests who usually show the finalists/winner's AMVs.\n\nAMVs should not be confused with music videos that employ original, professionally made animation (such as numerous music videos for songs by [[Iron Maiden]]), or with such short music video films (such as Japanese duo [[Chage and Aska]]'s song \"[[On Your Mark]]\" that was produced by the film company [[Studio Ghibli]]). AMVs should also not be confused with fan-made \"general animation\" videos using non-Japanese animated video sources like [[Western world|western]] cartoons, or with the practice of [[vidding]] in Western [[media fandom]], which [[convergent evolution|evolved convergently]] and has a distinct history and fan culture. Parallels can be drawn between AMVs and [[songvid]]s, animated fan-made videos using footage from movies, television series, or other sources.\n\nThe first anime music video was created in 1982 by 21-year-old Jim Kaposztas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fo20071115pm.html |last=Macias |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Macias |title=Remix this: anime gets hijacked |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2007-11-15 |accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref> Kaposztas hooked up two [[VCR]]s to each other and edited the most violent scenes from ''[[Star Blazers]]'' to \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" by [[The Beatles]] to produce a humorous effect.<ref>{{cite av media |author=AnimeCons TV |url=https://animecons.tv/extra/17/jim-kaposztas-interview|title=Jim Kaposztas Interview|date=2 October 2011|accessdate=1 June 2018|publisher=AnimeCons TV}}</ref>\n\n==Creation==\nThe creation of an AMV centers on using various [[film editing|video editing]] styles to create a feeling of synchronization and unity. Some examples include: \n* Raw Editing: Using basic zooming in and out \"effects\" along with simple transitions. \n* FX (Effects) Editing: This style consists of large amounts of visual effects. This can be accomplished in programs such as Sony Vegas or Adobe After Effects.\n* Timing Editing: The editor edits the clips such that the anime footage is in sync with the lyrics or beats (from the song) to create a perfect harmony. (E.g. Matching beats to gunshot scenes or making an anime character's lips move to make it seem like the character is saying or singing those words in the AMV)\n* Flow Editing: This requires the editor to use transitions and to keep the AMV flowing rather than to have it consist of rough cuts and choppy parts.\n* Animation Editing: Although it sounds similar to the term AMV editing, it is a new style where editors take a still image and animate it (making it move) (This also applies to Manga Music Videos (MMVs) which are similar to AMVs, instead they use manga as the main source of footage).\n* Masking: This style requires the editor to remove the background from the anime scene they would like to add effects to. It is a painstaking and time-consuming process.\n\n==Popularity==\n[[John Oppliger]] of [[AnimeNation]] has noted that fan-produced AMVs are popular mostly with Western fans but not with Japanese fans. One reason he cited was that Western fans experience a \"more purely\" visual experience inasmuch as most Western fans cannot understand the Japanese language, the original language of most [[anime]], and as a result \"the visuals make a greater impact\" on the senses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2003/09/08/ask-john-why-are-anime-music-videos-so-popular/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |authorlink=John Oppliger |title=Ask John: Why Are Anime Music Videos so Popular? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=2003-09-08 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430072040/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2003/09/08/ask-john-why-are-anime-music-videos-so-popular/ |archivedate=2009-04-30 }}</ref> The second reason he cited was that Westerners are \"encouraged by social pressure to grow out of cartoons and comics during the onset of adolescence\" whereas Japanese natives grow up with animation \"as a constant companion\";  as a result, English-speaking fans tend to utilize and reconstruct existing anime to create AMVs whereas Japanese fans \"are more intuitively inclined\" to create or expand on existing manga and anime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/06/23/ask-john-why-hasnt-doujinshi-caught-on-outside-of-japan/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |authorlink=John Oppliger |title=Ask John: Why Hasn\u2019t Doujinshi Caught on Outside of Japan? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=2005-06-23 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111225513/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/06/23/ask-john-why-hasnt-doujinshi-caught-on-outside-of-japan/ |archivedate=2012-01-11 }}</ref>\n\n== Legal issues ==\nThe Japanese culture is generally permissive with regard to the appropriation of ideas.

These copycat comics exhibit significant market penetration as well. More than 33,000 \"circles\" of creators from across Japan produce d\u014djinshi. More than 450,000 Japanese come together twice a year, in the largest public gathering in the country, to exchange and sell them. This market exists in parallel to the mainstream commercial manga market.

It contrasts with various [[highest averages method|highest averages methods]] (also known as divisor methods).\n\n==Method==\nThe ''largest remainder method'' requires the numbers of votes for each party to be divided by a quota representing the number of votes ''required'' for a seat (i.e. usually the total number of votes cast divided by the number of seats, or some similar formula). The result for each party will usually consist of an [[integer]] part plus a [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] [[remainder]]. Each party is first allocated a number of seats equal to their integer. This will generally leave some seats unallocated: the parties are then ranked on the basis of the fractional remainders, and the parties with the largest remainders are each allocated one additional seat until all the seats have been allocated. This gives the method its name.\n\n==Quotas==\nThere are several possibilities for the quota. The most common are:\nthe [[Hare quota]] and the [[Droop quota]].\n\nThe Hare (or simple) quota is defined as follows\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\text{total votes}}{\\text{total seats}}</math>\n\nIt is used for legislative elections in [[Elections in Russia|Russia]] (with a 5% exclusion threshold since 2016), [[Elections in Ukraine|Ukraine]] (5% threshold), [[Elections in Tunisia|Tunisia]],<ref name=tunisiaElectLaw>{{cite book|title=Proposed Basic Law on Elections and Referendums - Tunisia (Non-official translation to English)|date=26 January 2014|publisher=[[International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance|International IDEA]]|page=25|url=http://aceproject.org/ero-en/regions/africa/TN/tunisia-organic-law-on-elections-and-referenda/at_download/file|accessdate=9 August 2015|chapter=2}}</ref> [[Legislative elections in Taiwan|Taiwan]] (5% threshold), [[Elections in Namibia|Namibia]] and [[District_Council_(Second)|Hong Kong]].

It contrasts with various [[highest averages method|highest averages methods]] (also known as divisor methods).\n\n==Method==\nThe ''largest remainder method'' requires the numbers of votes for each party to be divided by a quota representing the number of votes ''required'' for a seat (i.e. usually the total number of votes cast divided by the number of seats, or some similar formula). The result for each party will usually consist of an [[integer]] part plus a [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] [[remainder]]. Each party is first allocated a number of seats equal to their integer. This will generally leave some seats unallocated: the parties are then ranked on the basis of the fractional remainders, and the parties with the largest remainders are each allocated one additional seat until all the seats have been allocated. This gives the method its name.\n\n==Quotas==\nThere are several possibilities for the quota. The most common are:\nthe [[Hare quota]] and the [[Droop quota]].\n\nThe Hare (or simple) quota is defined as follows\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\text{total votes}}{\\text{total seats}}</math>\n\nThe '''Hamilton method of apportionment''' is actually a largest-remainder method which uses the Hare Quota.

Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters. With more COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, the panel also proposed that new infections from abroad could initiate a \"second wave\" of the disease in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000608425.pdf|title=Views on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control (Summary Version)|last=The Government of Japan, Expert Meeting on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (in English)|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000606000.pdf|title=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u898b\u89e3|last=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u4f1a\u8b70|language=ja|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 March, the Health Ministry published a disease forecast of each prefecture and instructed their local governments to prepare their hospitals to accommodate its patient estimates.

Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters.
