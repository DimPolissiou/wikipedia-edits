It was co-written by Bowie and [[Brian Eno]], produced by Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]], and recorded in July and August 1977 at [[Hansa Tonstudio|Hansa Studio by the Wall]]. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|12th studio album of the same name]], backed with the song \"[[V-2 Schneider]]\". A product of Bowie's [[Berlin Trilogy|\"Berlin\" period]], the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or United States after its release, but it has since become one of his [[signature song]]s.

It was co-written by Bowie and [[Brian Eno]], produced by Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]], and recorded in July and August 1977 at [[Hansa Tonstudio|Hansa Studio by the Wall]]. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|12th studio album of the same name]], backed with the song \"[[V-2 Schneider]]\".

It is located on the block bounded by [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]], [[Claremont Avenue]], and 120th and 122nd Streets, near [[Columbia University]]'s Morningside Heights campus and across from [[Grant's Tomb]]. An [[interdenominational]] church, it is associated with the [[American Baptist Churches USA]] and the [[United Church of Christ]]. The church was conceived by philanthropist businessman [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], a Baptist, in conjunction with Presbyterian minister [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]] as a large, interdenominational church in Morningside Heights, a neighborhood surrounded by numerous academic institutions.\n\nThe original building, opened in 1930, was designed by Henry C. Pelton and [[Allen & Collens]] in the [[Neo-Gothic architecture|Neo-Gothic]] style. It contains a [[nave]] consisting of five [[Bay (architecture)|architectural bays]]; a [[chancel]] at the front of the nave; a 22-story, {{Convert|392|ft|m|-tall|abbr=|adj=mid}} tower above the [[nave]]; a [[narthex]] and [[chapel]]; and a [[cloister]]ed passageway that connects to the eastern entrance on Claremont Avenue. The main feature of the church is the 74-bell [[carillon]] near the top of the tower, dedicated to John Rockefeller Jr.'s mother [[Laura Spelman Rockefeller]]. A seven-story wing to the south of the original building was built in 1959 to a design by Collens, Willis & Beckonert, and renamed for [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in 1985. The Stone Gym, to the southeast, was built in 1915 as a dormitory designed by Louis E. Jallade, and was converted to a gym in 1962.\n\nA focal point of global and national activism since its inception, Riverside Church has a long history of [[social justice]], in adherence to Fosdick's original vision of an \"interdenominational, interracial, and international\" church.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 1\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2000|ps=.|p=1}}</ref> Riverside Church's congregation includes more than forty ethnic groups.

The [[chapel]] and [[narthex]] are located to the south, closer to 120th Street, while the [[chancel]] (which contains the altar) and [[ambulatory]] are located to the north, closer to 122nd Street.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 8\" />\n\n==== Facade ====\n[[File:The Riverside Church.jpg|thumb|The northern [[facade]] of Riverside Church, seen from 122nd Street at the eastern side of the [[ambulatory]]]]\nThe western facade of the nave runs along Riverside Drive.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 8\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 4\" /> At the time of Riverside Church's construction, the church did not own the lots along 120th Street to the south. As a result, the three entrances are on the west, facing Riverside Drive, rather than at the back of the nave to the south, as in other churches. The entrances are located atop a small flight of steps leading from the street.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 5\" /><ref name=\"Carder p. 5\" /> The west-facing main entrance, below the tower's base, is through a set of double wooden doors with recessed wooden panel.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 8\" /> The figures sculpted in the concentric [[archivolt]]s of the doorway represent leading religious, scientific, and philosophical figures, while an elaborate [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] is located below the arches (see {{Section link||Sculpted elements}}).<ref name=\"NYCL p. 5\" /><ref name=\"Paris et al. pp. 155-156\">{{harvnb|Paris et al.|2004|ps=.|pp=155\u2013156}}</ref> To the south is the entrance to the narthex, which contains a single door.<ref name=\"Paris et al. p. 156\" /> Directly south of the narthex entrance is another double-door entrance leads to the chapel,<ref name=\"Paris et al. p. 156\">{{harvnb|Paris et al.|2004|ps=.|p=156}}</ref><ref name=\"NPS p. 15\">{{harvnb|National Park Service|2012|ps=.|p=15}}</ref> and contains two archivolts and a simpler tympanum.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 8\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 4\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 15\" /> The northern portion of the western facade, adjacent to the nave, contains five sets of windows (see {{Section link||Nave}}).<ref name=\"NYCL p. 6\" /><ref name=\"Carder p. 18\" />\n\nThe view of the southern facade is mostly blocked by the MLK Wing to the south.

A [[baptism]]al pool is located behind the communion table.<ref name=\"Paris et al. p. 162\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 10\" />\n\nThe back of the chancel contains a convex polygonal wall. The wall includes seven bays, each with three vertical tiers that are a few feet above the corresponding tiers in the nave. The bottom tier contains pointed arches with [[Riverside Church#Chancel screen|an elaborate stone chancel screen]]; the middle tier contains [[arch#Type of arches|cusped arches]] with colonettes; and the top tier serves as the clerestory.<ref name=\"NPS p. 9\" /> The three center bays behind the chancel screen each contain one window group on the lower tier. These window groups each contain two lancet windows topped by a rose window, and are divided by vertical buttresses. The apse clerestory, the upper section of the ambulatory, is recessed slightly inward. The upper section's [[Fenestration (architecture)|fenestration]] is similar in form, in that it each window grouping contains a rose window above a pair of lancet windows, but the window groupings are located on five sides of the polygon.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 9\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 5\" /> The vertical piers of the chancel wall converge above the clerestory level, creating an [[apse]] above the chancel and ambulatory.<ref name=\"NPS p. 10\" />\n\n==== Narthex ====\n[[File:Riverside Church, New York City (2014) - 16.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|The chapel, facing the altar]]\nThe narthex, designed in the late Gothic style with a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] layout,<ref name=\"Paris et al. p. 156\" /> is located directly south of the nave and can be accessed from the church's West Portal.

Described by architectural historian [[Andrew Dolkart]] as \"earlier than Gothic\", the design is intended to give the impression that the rest of the sanctuary was built after the chapel.<ref name=\"Dolkart p. 79\" /> The chapel is subdivided into four bays and has a [[Barrel vault|barrel-vaulted]] ceiling with Guastavino tiles, while the walls and floor contain a limestone finish. The southern wall, adjacent to the MLK Wing, contains four arched, back-lit stained-glass windows, one in each bay. Double doors to the west lead to Riverside Drive while a passage to the south leads to the MLK Wing.<ref name=\"NPS p. 11\" /> There are [[engaged column]]s on the north and south walls between each of the four bays, as well as eight lanterns hanging from the columns.<ref name=\"NPS p. 12\" />\n\nThe eastern end of the chapel contains an [[altar]], located four steps above the main level of the chapel.

At the top of the tower is a conical metal roof.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 9\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 5\" />\n\n==== Tower stories ====\nMost of the tower's stories consist of plaster floors, steel doors, steel window frames, and iron lighting fixtures hanging from each ceiling. There are elevator lobbies with vaulted ceilings on several stories of the tower. On the stories that contain common spaces, including the 9th and 10th floors, the floors are finished with stone, [[terrazzo]], and wood, with wooden doors. Over the years, several spaces have been used by outside entities, who carpeted floors and installed fluorescent lighting fixtures in some office rooms.<ref name=\"NPS p. 13\" />\n\nOriginally, the 4th through 14th floors held Riverside Church's school, while the 15th floor and above contained various staff and clergy offices, as well as spaces for group activities.<ref name=\"Paris et al. p. 151\" /> The 2nd floor connects to the nave's lower seating gallery, while the 3rd floor leads to the upper seating gallery.

It is located on the block bounded by [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]], [[Claremont Avenue]], and 120th and 122nd Streets, near [[Columbia University]]'s Morningside Heights campus and across from [[Grant's Tomb]]. An [[interdenominational]] church, it is associated with the [[American Baptist Churches USA]] and the [[United Church of Christ]]. The church was conceived by philanthropist businessman [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], a Baptist, in conjunction with Presbyterian minister [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]] as a large, interdenominational church in Morningside Heights, a neighborhood surrounded by numerous academic institutions.\n\nThe original building, opened in 1930, was designed by Henry C. Pelton and [[Allen & Collens]] in the [[Neo-Gothic architecture|Neo-Gothic]] style. It contains a [[nave]] consisting of five [[Bay (architecture)|architectural bays]]; a [[chancel]] at the front of the nave; a 22-story, {{Convert|392|ft|m|-tall|abbr=|adj=mid}} tower above the [[nave]]; a [[narthex]] and [[chapel]]; and a [[cloister]]ed passageway that connects to the eastern entrance on Claremont Avenue. The main feature of the church is the 74-bell [[carillon]] near the top of the tower, dedicated to John Rockefeller Jr.'s mother [[Laura Spelman Rockefeller]]. A seven-story wing to the south of the original building was built in 1959 to a design by Collens, Willis & Beckonert, and renamed for [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in 1985. The Stone Gym, to the southeast, was built in 1915 as a dormitory designed by Louis E. Jallade, and was converted to a gym in 1962.\n\nA focal point of global and national activism since its inception, Riverside Church has a long history of [[social justice]], in adherence to Fosdick's original vision of an \"interdenominational, interracial, and international\" church.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 1\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2000|ps=.|p=1}}</ref> Riverside Church's congregation includes more than forty ethnic groups.

The [[chapel]] and [[narthex]] are located to the south, closer to 120th Street, while the [[chancel]] (which contains the altar) and [[ambulatory]] are located to the north, closer to 122nd Street.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 8\" />\n\n==== Facade ====\n[[File:The Riverside Church.jpg|thumb|The northern [[facade]] of Riverside Church, seen from 122nd Street at the eastern side of the [[ambulatory]]]]\nThe western facade of the nave runs along Riverside Drive.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 8\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 4\" /> At the time of Riverside Church's construction, the church did not own the lots along 120th Street to the south. As a result, the three entrances are on the west, facing Riverside Drive, rather than at the back of the nave to the south, as in other churches. The entrances are located atop a small flight of steps leading from the street.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 5\" /><ref name=\"Carder p. 5\" /> The west-facing main entrance, below the tower's base, is through a set of double wooden doors with recessed wooden panel.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 8\" /> The figures sculpted in the concentric [[archivolt]]s of the doorway represent leading religious, scientific, and philosophical figures, while an elaborate [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] is located below the arches (see {{Section link||Sculpted elements}}).<ref name=\"NYCL p. 5\" /><ref name=\"Paris et al. pp. 155-156\">{{harvnb|Paris et al.|2004|ps=.|pp=155\u2013156}}</ref> To the south is the entrance to the narthex, which contains a single door.<ref name=\"Paris et al. p. 156\" /> Directly south of the narthex entrance is another double-door entrance leads to the chapel,<ref name=\"Paris et al. p. 156\">{{harvnb|Paris et al.|2004|ps=.|p=156}}</ref><ref name=\"NPS p. 15\">{{harvnb|National Park Service|2012|ps=.|p=15}}</ref> and contains two archivolts and a simpler tympanum.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 8\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 4\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 15\" /> The northern portion of the western facade, adjacent to the nave, contains five sets of windows (see {{Section link||Nave}}).<ref name=\"NYCL p. 6\" /><ref name=\"Carder p. 18\" />\n\nThe view of the southern facade is mostly blocked by the MLK Wing to the south.

A [[baptism]]al pool is located behind the communion table.<ref name=\"Paris et al. p. 162\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 10\" />\n\nThe back of the chancel contains a convex polygonal wall. The wall includes seven bays, each with three vertical tiers that are a few feet above the corresponding tiers in the nave. The bottom tier contains pointed arches with [[Riverside Church#Chancel screen|an elaborate stone chancel screen]]; the middle tier contains [[arch#Type of arches|cusped arches]] with colonettes; and the top tier serves as the clerestory.<ref name=\"NPS p. 9\" /> The three center bays behind the chancel screen each contain one window group on the lower tier. These window groups each contain two lancet windows topped by a rose window, and are divided by vertical buttresses. The apse clerestory, the upper section of the ambulatory, is recessed slightly inward. The upper section's [[Fenestration (architecture)|fenestration]] is similar in form, in that it each window grouping contains a rose window above a pair of lancet windows, but the window groupings are located on five sides of the polygon.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 9\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 5\" /> The vertical piers of the chancel wall converge above the clerestory level, creating an [[apse]] above the chancel and ambulatory.<ref name=\"NPS p. 10\" />\n\n==== Narthex ====\n[[File:Riverside Church, New York City (2014) - 16.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|The chapel, facing the altar]]\nThe narthex, designed in the late Gothic style with a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] layout,<ref name=\"Paris et al. p. 156\" /> is located directly south of the nave and can be accessed from the church's West Portal.

Described by architectural historian [[Andrew Dolkart]] as \"earlier than Gothic\", the design is intended to give the impression that the rest of the sanctuary was built after the chapel.<ref name=\"Dolkart p. 79\" /> The chapel is subdivided into four bays and has a [[Barrel vault|barrel-vaulted]] ceiling with Guastavino tiles, while the walls and floor contain a limestone finish. The southern wall, adjacent to the MLK Wing, contains four arched, back-lit stained-glass windows, one in each bay. Double doors to the west lead to Riverside Drive while a passage to the south leads to the MLK Wing.<ref name=\"NPS p. 11\" /> There are [[engaged column]]s on the north and south walls between each of the four bays, as well as eight lanterns hanging from the columns.<ref name=\"NPS p. 12\" /> \n\nThe eastern end of the chapel contains an [[altar]], located four steps above the main level of the chapel.

At the top of the tower is a conical metal roof.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 9\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 5\" />\n\n==== Tower stories ====\nMost of the tower's stories consist of plaster floors, steel doors, steel window frames, and iron lighting fixtures hanging from each ceiling. There are elevator lobbies with vaulted ceilings on several stories of the tower. On the stories that contain common spaces, including the 9th and 10th floors, the floors are finished with stone, [[terrazzo]], and wood, with wooden doors. Over the years, several spaces have been used by outside entities, who carpeted floors and installed fluorescent lighting fixtures in some office rooms.<ref name=\"NPS p. 13\" />\n\nOriginally, the 4th through 14th floors held Riverside Church's school, while the 15th floor and above contained various staff and clergy offices, as well as spaces for group activities.<ref name=\"Paris et al. p. 151\" /> The 2nd floor connects to the nave's lower seating gallery, while the 3rd floor leads to the upper seating gallery.
