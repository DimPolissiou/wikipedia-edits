One of the most persistent was originally chartered in 1868 as the Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge Company, whose proposed bridge would have crossed from [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]] to [[Fort Clinton]], now roughly the site of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. It was never built.\n\nThe Poughkeepsie Bridge Company was chartered in June 1871 to build the bridge, and [[J. Edgar Thomson]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] was persuaded to support the effort. Contracts were let to a firm called the American Bridge Company (not the [[American Bridge Company|company of the same name]] founded later), but the [[Panic of 1873]] intervened and the scheme collapsed.\n\nIn 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was organized to finance the construction. Among the prominent backers was [[Henry Clay Frick]], the coal tycoon and associate of [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The [[Union Bridge Company]] of [[Athens, Pennsylvania]], which had completed the [[Michigan Central Railway|Michigan Central]] cantilever bridge at Niagara (see [[Niagara Cantilever Bridge]]), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by [[Charles Macdonald (architect)|Charles Macdonald]] and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction was carried out by constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with [[falsework]]. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.\n\nConsidered an engineering marvel of the day, the bridge has seven main spans. The total length is {{convert|6,768|ft|m}}, including approaches, and the top of the deck is {{convert|212|ft|m}} above water. It is a multispan cantilever truss bridge, having two river-crossing cantilever spans of {{convert|548|ft|m}} each, one center span of {{convert|546|ft|m}}, two anchor (connecting) spans of {{convert|525|ft|m}}, two shore spans of {{convert|201|ft|m}} each, a {{convert|2,641|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the eastern bank and a {{convert|1,033|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the western bank. All seven spans were built of newly available Bessemer Process \"mild\" (between 0.16% and 0.29% carbon) steel, while the two approach viaducts were built of iron. It formed part of the most direct rail route between the industrial northeastern states and the midwestern and western states.<ref>POUGHKEEPSIE EAGLE Souvenir Edition dated January 1, 1889; plus independent engineering articles from the period.</ref>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0676).jpg|thumb|left|Poughkeepsie Bridge ca. 1900]]\n[[File:Under the Bridge, Poughkeepsie, N.

Traffic from the connecting [[New York, Ontario & Western]] ceased when that railroad shut down on March 30, 1957. Another connection, the coal-, slate-, and cement-hauling [[Lehigh & New England]], shut down in 1961. At the same time, some new traffic began crossing the bridge, such as the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven's]] \"Super Jet\", one of the first trains to carry truck trailers. The [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]]'s acquisition of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven]] in 1969 discouraged connecting traffic with the [[Erie Lackawanna]], which competed with other Penn Central routes. After 1971, only one through train in each direction, for [[Erie Lackawanna]], crossed the bridge.<ref name=swanberg>{{Citation | last = Swanberg | first = J.W. | title = Railroad Blueprint: Maybrook, New York| journal = Trains Magazine |date=January 2005 | pages = 50\u201359}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Penn Central did not connect with the old New Haven on the west side of the bridge, it came close. For a short time in 1969 and 1970, Penn Central ran a daily train between [[Cedar Hill Yard]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[Potomac Yard]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], by way of the [[Lehigh and Hudson River Railway]], which connected with the [[Penn Central]] [[Belvidere Delaware Railroad|Belvidere Division]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], 72 miles south of the old interchange with the New Haven at [[Maybrook Yard]] in [[Maybrook, New York]]. The service ended in a dispute over haulage charges and the traffic was diverted to the longer all-Penn Central route through [[Selkirk, New York]]. Ironically, the only reason the [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] was not part of the Penn Central was because a Penn Central predecessor, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], had prevented the New Haven from acquiring it in 1905.<ref name=swanberg/> The [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] and Erie Lackawanna were finally joined with the Penn Central when all were taken over by [[Conrail]] in 1976.\n\nOn May 8, 1974 a [[Railroad tie|tie]] fire damaged about {{convert|700|ft|m}} of decking and underlying girders on the bridge's eastern section.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cruz | first = Roberto | title = Railroad bridge fire 40th anniversary: Fire in the sky | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2014/05/07/poughkeepsie-railroad-fire-anniversary/8831573/ | accessdate =  January 2, 2015}}</ref> It was likely started by a spark from an eastbound freight train that had just crossed the span.<ref>{{Citation | last  = Sutherland | first = Joseph | title = Fire Closes Rail Bridge 3 Months | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = May 9, 1974 | page = 1 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R1VRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4DMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1613%2C1667620 }}</ref> The Penn Central had neglected the bridge's fire-protection system, which had no water on the day of the fire, and had laid off employees who kept watch for such fires.<ref name=mabee /> A photograph of the last train, a run-through from the [[Erie Lackawanna]], was included in a 40th anniversary web feature by the [[Poughkeepsie Journal]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cusumano | first = Chris | title = INTERACTIVE: How the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge fire changed history | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/longform/news/2014/05/07/bridgefire/8725801/ | accessdate = January 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1974, the Penn Central applied for $1.75 million to repair and improve the bridge from the federal government through the [[Regional Rail Reorganization Act]] of 1973.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fate of Poughkeepsie Rail Bridge Up to Court | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = August 30, 1974  | page = 4A | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IlRRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rTMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=987%2C5261610 }}</ref> By 1975, efforts had shifted to acquiring a combination of state and railroad funding.

Though Central Hudson admitted that it normally had a legal duty to remove its abandoned power lines, it refused to remove its abandoned bridge-affixed lines, instead relying on a claim that it no longer owned the lines at issue pursuant to prior litigation with Conrail that was decided on September 26, 1984,<ref>Consolidated Rail Corporation v.

Despite this, inevitable comparisons have been drawn to the similar [[Kinzua Bridge]], in northwestern Pennsylvania, which blew over in a [[microburst]] tornado when the bolts connecting the steel framework to the piers failed. Ironically, renovation work was going on to strengthen the corroded areas when the tornado destroyed most of this former Erie Railroad viaduct. During [[Hurricane Irene]], residents living within 500 feet of the Poughkeepsie Bridge were evacuated as a precaution, and emergency repairs to reduce bridge sway (by the addition of new steel X-braces, supplanting the original turnbuckle-adjusted tension rods) were hurriedly installed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe bridge became a [[National Recreation Trail]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.americantrails.org/nationalrecreationtrails/09NRTapps.html |title=2009 National Recreation Trail designations |accessdate=January 1, 2011 |publisher=[[National Trails System]]}}</ref>\n\n==Walkway over the Hudson State Historic Park==\n[[File:Walkway Over the Hudson 4.JPG|thumb|left|The walkway shortly after its opening]]\nThe opening ceremony of the Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park, on October 3, 2009, featured music by [[Pete Seeger]], and was attended by Governor [[David Paterson]], Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], Congressman [[Maurice Hinchey]], president of nearby [[Vassar College]] [[Catharine Bond Hill]],<ref>{{cite news| title = Poughkeepsie unveils historic Walkway Over Hudson| newspaper = [[Miscellany News]]| location = [[Poughkeepsie, New York]]| date = October 7, 2009| url = http://www.miscellanynews.com/poughkeepsie-unveils-historic-walkway-over-hudson-1.1943475| accessdate = December 22, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091011035312/http://www.miscellanynews.com/poughkeepsie-unveils-historic-walkway-over-hudson-1.1943475| archive-date = October 11, 2009| url-status = dead}}</ref> John May, engineer of the last train across the bridge, and other officials.

The proposal seemed so absurd that the ''Eagle'' ridiculed it, and it was effectively forgotten for a few years.<ref name=mabee>{{cite book|last=Mabee|first=Carleton|title=Bridging The Hudson: The Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge and Its Connecting Railroad Lines|publisher=Purple Mountain Press|year=2001|isbn=1-930098-24-3 }}</ref><ref name=WalkwayHist>{{cite web |url=https://walkway.org/history |title=History |publisher=Walkway Over the Hudson |accessdate=December 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401162715/https://walkway.org/history |archive-date=April 1, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOver the years, many plans had been made for a [[fixed span]] across the [[Hudson River]] south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] to replace numerous [[car float]] and ferry operations. One of the most persistent was originally chartered in 1868 as the Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge Company, whose proposed bridge would have crossed from [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]] to [[Fort Clinton]], now roughly the site of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. It was never built.\n\nThe Poughkeepsie Bridge Company was chartered in June 1871 to build the bridge, and [[J. Edgar Thomson]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] was persuaded to support the effort. Contracts were let to a firm called the American Bridge Company (not the [[American Bridge Company|company of the same name]] founded later), but the [[Panic of 1873]] intervened and the scheme collapsed.\n\nIn 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was organized to finance the construction. Among the prominent backers was [[Henry Clay Frick]], the coal tycoon and associate of [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The [[Union Bridge Company]] of [[Athens, Pennsylvania]], which had completed the [[Michigan Central Railway|Michigan Central]] cantilever bridge at Niagara (see [[Niagara Cantilever Bridge]]), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by [[Charles Macdonald (architect)|Charles Macdonald]] and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction was carried out by constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with [[falsework]]. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.\n\nConsidered an engineering marvel of the day, the bridge has seven main spans. The total length is {{convert|6,768|ft|m}}, including approaches, and the top of the deck is {{convert|212|ft|m}} above water. It is a multispan cantilever truss bridge, having two river-crossing cantilever spans of {{convert|548|ft|m}} each, one center span of {{convert|546|ft|m}}, two anchor (connecting) spans of {{convert|525|ft|m}}, two shore spans of {{convert|201|ft|m}} each, a {{convert|2,641|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the eastern bank and a {{convert|1,033|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the western bank. All seven spans were built of newly available Bessemer Process \"mild\" (between 0.16% and 0.29% carbon) steel, while the two approach viaducts were built of iron. It formed part of the most direct rail route between the industrial northeastern states and the midwestern and western states.<ref>POUGHKEEPSIE EAGLE Souvenir Edition dated January 1, 1889; plus independent engineering articles from the period.</ref>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0676).jpg|thumb|left|Poughkeepsie Bridge ca. 1900]]\n[[File:Under the Bridge, Poughkeepsie, N.

Traffic from the connecting [[New York, Ontario & Western]] ceased when that railroad shut down on March 30, 1957. Another connection, the coal-, slate-, and cement-hauling [[Lehigh & New England]], shut down in 1961. At the same time, some new traffic began crossing the bridge, such as the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven's]] \"Super Jet\", one of the first trains to carry truck trailers. The [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]]'s acquisition of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven]] in 1969 discouraged connecting traffic with the [[Erie Lackawanna]], which competed with other Penn Central routes. After 1971, only one through train in each direction, for [[Erie Lackawanna]], crossed the bridge.<ref name=swanberg>{{Citation | last = Swanberg | first = J.W. | title = Railroad Blueprint: Maybrook, New York| journal = Trains Magazine |date=January 2005 | pages = 50\u201359}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Penn Central did not connect with the old New Haven on the west side of the bridge, it came close. For a short time in 1969 and 1970, Penn Central ran a daily train between [[Cedar Hill Yard]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[Potomac Yard]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], by way of the [[Lehigh and Hudson River Railway]], which connected with the [[Penn Central]] [[Belvidere Delaware Railroad|Belvidere Division]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], 72 miles south of the old interchange with the New Haven at [[Maybrook Yard]] in [[Maybrook, New York]]. The service ended in a dispute over haulage charges and the traffic was diverted to the longer all-Penn Central route through [[Selkirk, New York]]. Ironically, the only reason the [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] was not part of the Penn Central was because a Penn Central predecessor, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], had prevented the New Haven from acquiring it in 1905.<ref name=swanberg/> The [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] and Erie Lackawanna were finally joined with the Penn Central when all were taken over by [[Conrail]] in 1976.\n\nOn May 8, 1974 a [[Railroad tie|tie]] fire damaged about {{convert|700|ft|m}} of decking and underlying girders on the bridge's eastern section.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cruz | first = Roberto | title = Railroad bridge fire 40th anniversary: Fire in the sky | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2014/05/07/poughkeepsie-railroad-fire-anniversary/8831573/ | accessdate =  January 2, 2015}}</ref> It was likely started by a spark from an eastbound freight train that had just crossed the span.<ref>{{Citation | last  = Sutherland | first = Joseph | title = Fire Closes Rail Bridge 3 Months | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = May 9, 1974 | page = 1 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R1VRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4DMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1613%2C1667620 }}</ref> The Penn Central had neglected the bridge's fire-protection system, which had no water on the day of the fire, and had laid off employees who kept watch for such fires.<ref name=mabee /> A photograph of the last train, a run-through from the [[Erie Lackawanna]], was included in a 40th anniversary web feature by the [[Poughkeepsie Journal]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cusumano | first = Chris | title = INTERACTIVE: How the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge fire changed history | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/longform/news/2014/05/07/bridgefire/8725801/ | accessdate = January 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1974, the Penn Central applied for $1.75 million to repair and improve the bridge from the federal government through the [[Regional Rail Reorganization Act]] of 1973.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fate of Poughkeepsie Rail Bridge Up to Court | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = August 30, 1974  | page = 4A | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IlRRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rTMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=987%2C5261610 }}</ref> By 1975, efforts had shifted to acquiring a combination of state and railroad funding.

Further, all of the 2,200-pound brackets that connected Central Hudson's de-energized high-tension power lines to the south side of the bridge continued to deteriorate by rusting. Though Central Hudson admitted that it normally had a legal duty to remove its abandoned power lines, it refused to remove its abandoned bridge-affixed lines, instead relying on a claim that it no longer owned the lines at issue pursuant to prior litigation with Conrail that was decided on September 26, 1984,<ref>Consolidated Rail Corporation v.

Despite this, inevitable comparisons have been drawn to the similar [[Kinzua Bridge]], in northwestern Pennsylvania, which blew over in a [[microburst]] tornado when the bolts connecting the steel framework to the piers failed. Ironically, renovation work was going on to strengthen the corroded areas when the tornado destroyed most of this former Erie Railroad viaduct. During [[Hurricane Irene]], residents living within 500 feet of the Poughkeepsie Bridge were evacuated as a precaution, and emergency repairs to reduce bridge sway (by the addition of new steel X-braces, supplanting the original turnbuckle-adjusted tension rods) were hurriedly installed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe bridge became a [[National Recreation Trail]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.americantrails.org/nationalrecreationtrails/09NRTapps.html |title=2009 National Recreation Trail designations |accessdate=January 1, 2011 |publisher=[[National Trails System]]}}</ref>\n\n==Walkway over the Hudson State Historic Park==\n[[File:Walkway Over the Hudson 4.JPG|thumb|left|The walkway shortly after its opening]]\nThe opening ceremony of the Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park, on October 3, 2009, featured music by [[Pete Seeger]], and was attended by Governor [[David Paterson]], Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], Congressman [[Maurice Hinchey]], president of nearby [[Vassar College]] [[Catharine Bond Hill]],<ref>{{cite news| title = Poughkeepsie unveils historic Walkway Over Hudson| newspaper = [[Miscellany News]]| location = [[Poughkeepsie, New York]]| date = October 7, 2009| url = http://www.miscellanynews.com/poughkeepsie-unveils-historic-walkway-over-hudson-1.1943475| accessdate = December 22, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091011035312/http://www.miscellanynews.com/poughkeepsie-unveils-historic-walkway-over-hudson-1.1943475| archive-date = October 11, 2009| url-status = dead}}</ref> John May, engineer of the last train across the bridge, and other officials.

Paul III publicly sanctioned slavery in Rome in 1545, the enslavement of [[Henry VIII]] in 1547, and the purchase of Muslim slaves in 1548.<ref>\"The Catholic Church and Slavery\", J.

Georgia]]'', giving Georgia authority to extend state laws over [[Cherokee]]s within the state, and famously describing Native American tribes as \"domestic dependent nations.\" This decision was modified in ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'', which stated that the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], and not individual [[U.S. state|states]], had authority in Indian affairs, but it maintained the loss of right to title upon discovery by Europeans.\n\nIn recent years, Native American groups including the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] and [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] have called on the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to revoke the bulls of 1452, 1455, and 1493.

The majority held that state same-sex marriage bans are a violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[Due Process Clause|Due Process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] Clauses.\n\n\"The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach,\" the Court declared, \"a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity.\"<ref>''Obergefell v.

See the dissenting opinions below.</ref> insisting its precedents \"inquired about the right to marry in its comprehensive sense, asking if there was a sufficient justification for excluding the relevant class from the right.\" Indeed, the majority averred, \"If rights were defined by who exercised them in the past, then received practices could serve as their own continued justification and new groups could not invoke rights once denied.\" Citing its prior decisions in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' and ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', the Court framed the issue accordingly in ''Obergefell''.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 18 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</ref>\n\nThe Court listed four distinct reasons why the fundamental right to marry applies to same-sex couples, citing ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' in support throughout its discussion. First, \"the right to personal choice regarding marriage is inherent in the concept of individual autonomy.\"<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 12.</ref> Second, \"the right to marry is fundamental because it supports a two-person union unlike any other in its importance to the committed individuals,\" a principle applying equally to same-sex couples.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 13.</ref> Third, the fundamental right to marry \"safeguards children and families and thus draws meaning from related rights of childrearing, procreation, and education\"; as same-sex couples have children and families, they are deserving of this safeguard\u2014though the right to marry in the United States has never been conditioned on procreation.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 14\u201316.</ref> Fourth, and lastly, \"marriage is a keystone of our social order,\" and \"[t]here is no difference between same- and opposite-sex couples with respect to this principle\"; consequently, preventing same-sex couples from marrying puts them at odds with society, denies them countless benefits of marriage, and introduces instability into their relationships for no justifiable reason.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nThe Court noted the relationship between the liberty of the Due Process Clause and the equality of the Equal Protection Clause and determined that same-sex marriage bans violated the latter.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 19\u201322.</ref> Concluding that the liberty and equality of same-sex couples was significantly burdened, the Court struck down same-sex marriage bans for violating both clauses, holding that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry in all fifty states \"on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.\"<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 22\u201323.</ref>\n\nDue to the \"substantial and continuing harm\" and the \"instability and uncertainty\" caused by state marriage laws differing with regard to same-sex couples, and because respondent states had conceded that a ruling requiring them to marry same-sex couples would undermine their refusal to hold valid same-sex marriages performed in other states, the Court also held that states must recognize same-sex marriages legally performed in other states.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 27\u201328.</ref>\n\nAddressing respondent states' argument, the Court emphasized that, while the democratic process may be an appropriate means for deciding issues such as same-sex marriage, no individual has to rely solely on the democratic process to exercise a fundamental right.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 23\u201326.</ref> \"An individual can invoke a right to constitutional protection when he or she is harmed, even if the broader public disagrees and even if the legislature refuses to act,\" for \"fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\"<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 24 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</ref> Furthermore, to rule against same-sex couples in this case, letting the democratic process play out as \"a cautious approach to recognizing and protecting fundamental rights\" would harm same-sex couples in the interim.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 25\u201326. The Court invoked ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' as an exemplum of this principle.</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the Court rejected the notion that allowing same-sex couples to marry harms the institution of marriage, leading to fewer opposite-sex marriages through a severing of the link between procreation and marriage, calling the notion \"counterintuitive\" and \"unrealistic\".<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 26.</ref> Instead, the Court stated that married same-sex couples \"would pose no risk of harm to themselves or third parties\".<ref name=\"Obergefell, slip op. at 27\">''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 27.</ref> The majority also stressed that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protects those who disagree with same-sex marriage.<ref name=\"Obergefell, slip op. at 27\"/>\n\nIn closing, Justice Kennedy wrote for the Court:\n\n{{quote|text=No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law.
