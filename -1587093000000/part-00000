When Ben finds the Omnitrix, a mysterious watch that transforms him into 10 different aliens, a world of extraterrestrial superpowers opens up to him. The series is produced by Cartoon Network Studios and created and executive produced by Man of Action Entertainment (''Big Hero 6'', ''Generator Rex'' and the original four ''Ben 10'' shows in their shared continuity), with John Fang (''Mixels'', ''Generator Rex'') on board as supervising producer.\n\n===Season 1 (2017)===\nTen-year-old Ben Tennyson has spent his summer vacation traveling across the country with his cousin Gwen and Grandpa Max, in an RV nicknamed the Rustbucket. However, after coming across a strange high-tech watch known as the Omnitrix, which enables him to transform into 10 alien heroes, he finds himself in the position of a superhero. At each place his family stops, Ben goes from trying to find a source of entertainment to doing battle against supervillains such as the mad scientist Dr. Animo, the dark sorcerer Hex, the psychotic clown Zombozo, the technology-loathing Steam-Smythe, and the emotionless Weatherheads, amongst other threats both big and small. Despite having lots to learn, he hones his hero skills with Gwen and Max's help.\n\nWhile battling one of Animo's mutant creations during a trip to Portland, Ben unlocks an 11th alien he names Gax, a Chimera Sui Generis with laser vision and great strength. However, unlocking this form seems to have an odd effect on the Omnitrix, leaving him unable to control his transformations. To determine the source of this issue, Max calls in his old friend Phil. Ben finds himself under attack from three alien bounty hunters named Tetrax, Kraab, and Sixsix. While he's able to fend them off, he meets a mysterious aged Chimera Sui Generis calling himself \"Vil\", who trains Ben to use Gax's powers. However, it turns out \"Vil\" and Gax are the two halves of alien conqueror Vilgax, who tricks Ben into freeing Gax from the Omnitrix and subsequently absorbs Gax's power to restore himself to full strength. The bounty hunter trio were hired to prevent Vilgax from reforming and thus team up with Ben to prevent the conqueror from destroying the watch. Vilgax wins this battle, dispatching the hunters and leaving Ben rapidly changing between his alien forms and, according to Phil, unable to return to human form.\n\nVilgax intends to use lava from Mount Megaladon to recharge his ship and restart his conquering spree. Ben, regardless of his current state, engages Vilgax in battle. The tentacle-faced villain becomes interested in possessing the Omnitrix rather than destroying it, after seeing what it can do to a weak human boy like Ben. While at first hampered by his inability to predict which form he'll become next, Ben is able to turn the tides and defeat Vilgax by upgrading the Omnitrix, supposedly sacrificing the Galvanic Mechamorph. Ben makes it out alive and Vilgax is defeated.

As his enemies grow stronger, Ben is aided by the appearance of new \"Omni-Enhanced\" versions of his alien forms, who possess a strange blue energy that packs a major punch in battle. He also has unlocked a new alien hero whom he dubs \"Shock Rock\", whose form is made up of the same blue energy.\n\nMeanwhile, Vilgax, still seeking a method to escape Earth, forms alliances with some of Ben's enemies to harness the Omnitrix's power. Team Tennyson make it their mission to defeat Vilgax and stop his devious machinations from seeing light.\n\nHowever, following a battle with Vilgax's war-bot, Ben learns that his new forms are a sign of a bigger threat. Shock Rock is a Fulmini, whose DNA pod replaced Upgrade following his sacrifice. The Fulmini Empire and their leader, the High Override, have been manipulating Ben to invade Earth and use the Omnitrix as a gateway. Ben and Vilgax team up, entering the Omnitrix and allying with a heroic fusion between his DNA and Upgrade's damaged DNA calling itself Glitch. Though the High Override banishes Vilgax to the Null Void, Team Tennyson are able to free Ben from his control and purge the Fulmini from the watch, causing it to reboot. Glitch survives the reboot by escaping the Omnitrix, joining the family.\n\n===Season 3 (2019)===\nAfter a serious battle with the High Override, Glitch merges with the Rustbuggy and becomes part of the Tennyson family. Ben gets frustrated when the Omnitrix reboots for a week, but it activates just as the Tennyson family is about to do some world traveling. Phil has created a helicopter called the \"Omni-Copter\" for the Tennyson Trio so they can travel around the world. The reboot reveals three new aliens, Rath, Slapback, and Humungosaur, who replace Grey Matter, Overflow, and Wildvine. With Vilgax in the Null Void, Ben has a new enemy to fight: Kevin Levin, who has an Omnitrix of his own, called the \"AntiTrix\", which gives him access to altered versions of Ben's aliens. A mysterious villain called the Forever Knight gathers up Ben's villains for a common cause. As revealed in the two-part finale ''Roundabout'', his goal is to go back in time and prevent alien signals from contacting Earth.\n\nThroughout the season, the Forever Knight tests Team Tennyson's enemies to determine those he needs for this goal: the final roster consist of Kevin, Charmcaster, Vin Ethanol, Billy Billions, Simon Sez, and a delusional Ben. While searching for Ben, Phil gifts Gwen with a robot cat suit. Kevin, angry at the Forever Knight for discarding him, teams up with Gwen to help Ben prevent the Forever Knight from altering history. In the end, both Kevin and the Knight end up trapped through time and space.\n\nBen and Gwen make it back to the present and head back to America aboard the Omni-Copter alongside Grandpa Max, Phil, Vin, and Simon, the latter two being convinced to join Team Tennyson. Also, Billy and Charmcaster get taken into custody.\n\n=== Season 4 (2020) ===\n\nIn the start of Season 4, Ben's Omnitrix is unlocked in a armored version in which he unlocks Jetray ,who replaces Stinkfly . Kevin's AntiTrix is on a different armored version of it, unlocking Ultimate Kevin, a powerful version of Kevin (voiced by Greg Cipes).\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Ben 10 characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Ben Tennyson]] (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) \u2013 The ten-year-old cousin of Gwen and grandson of Max Tennyson.

When Ben finds the Omnitrix, a mysterious watch that transforms him into 10 different aliens, a world of extraterrestrial superpowers opens up to him. The series is produced by Cartoon Network Studios and created and executive produced by Man of Action Entertainment (''Big Hero 6'', ''Generator Rex'' and the original four ''Ben 10'' shows in their shared continuity), with John Fang (''Mixels'', ''Generator Rex'') on board as supervising producer.\n\n===Season 1 (2017)===\nTen-year-old Ben Tennyson has spent his summer vacation traveling across the country with his cousin Gwen and Grandpa Max, in an RV nicknamed the Rustbucket. However, after coming across a strange high-tech watch known as the Omnitrix, which enables him to transform into 10 alien heroes, he finds himself in the position of a superhero. At each place his family stops, Ben goes from trying to find a source of entertainment to doing battle against supervillains such as the mad scientist Dr. Animo, the dark sorcerer Hex, the psychotic clown Zombozo, the technology-loathing Steam-Smythe, and the emotionless Weatherheads, amongst other threats both big and small. Despite having lots to learn, he hones his hero skills with Gwen and Max's help.\n\nWhile battling one of Animo's mutant creations during a trip to Portland, Ben unlocks an 11th alien he names Gax, a Chimera Sui Generis with laser vision and great strength. However, unlocking this form seems to have an odd effect on the Omnitrix, leaving him unable to control his transformations. To determine the source of this issue, Max calls in his old friend Phil. Ben finds himself under attack from three alien bounty hunters named Tetrax, Kraab, and Sixsix. While he's able to fend them off, he meets a mysterious aged Chimera Sui Generis calling himself \"Vil\", who trains Ben to use Gax's powers. However, it turns out \"Vil\" and Gax are the two halves of alien conqueror Vilgax, who tricks Ben into freeing Gax from the Omnitrix and subsequently absorbs Gax's power to restore himself to full strength. The bounty hunter trio were hired to prevent Vilgax from reforming and thus team up with Ben to prevent the conqueror from destroying the watch. Vilgax wins this battle, dispatching the hunters and leaving Ben rapidly changing between his alien forms and, according to Phil, unable to return to human form.\n\nVilgax intends to use lava from Mount Megaladon to recharge his ship and restart his conquering spree. Ben, regardless of his current state, engages Vilgax in battle. The tentacle-faced villain becomes interested in possessing the Omnitrix rather than destroying it, after seeing what it can do to a weak human boy like Ben. While at first hampered by his inability to predict which form he'll become next, Ben is able to turn the tides and defeat Vilgax by upgrading the Omnitrix, supposedly sacrificing the Galvanic Mechamorph. Ben makes it out alive and Vilgax is defeated.\n\n===Season 2 (2018)===\nThe Tennysons continue to visit some of America's greatest tourist spots, as Ben continues to take his hero career to new heights. As his enemies grow stronger, Ben is aided by the appearance of new \"Omni-Enhanced\" versions of his alien forms, who possess a strange blue energy that packs a major punch in battle. He also has unlocked a new alien hero whom he dubs \"Shock Rock\", whose form is made up of the same blue energy.\n\nMeanwhile, Vilgax, still seeking a method to escape Earth, forms alliances with some of Ben's enemies to harness the Omnitrix's power. Team Tennyson make it their mission to defeat Vilgax and stop his devious machinations from seeing light.\n\nHowever, following a battle with Vilgax's war-bot, Ben learns that his new forms are a sign of a bigger threat. Shock Rock is a Fulmini, whose DNA pod replaced Upgrade following his sacrifice. The Fulmini Empire and their leader, the High Override, have been manipulating Ben to invade Earth and use the Omnitrix as a gateway. Ben and Vilgax team up, entering the Omnitrix and allying with a heroic fusion between his DNA and Upgrade's damaged DNA calling itself Glitch. Though the High Override banishes Vilgax to the Null Void, Team Tennyson are able to free Ben from his control and purge the Fulmini from the watch, causing it to reboot. Glitch survives the reboot by escaping the Omnitrix, joining the family.\n\n===Season 3 (2019)===\nAfter a serious battle with the High Override, Glitch merges with the Rustbuggy and becomes part of the Tennyson family. Ben gets frustrated when the Omnitrix reboots for a week, but it activates just as the Tennyson family is about to do some world traveling. Phil has created a helicopter called the \"Omni-Copter\" for the Tennyson Trio so they can travel around the world. The reboot reveals three new aliens, Rath, Slapback, and Humungosaur, who replace Grey Matter, Overflow, and Wildvine. With Vilgax in the Null Void, Ben has a new enemy to fight: Kevin Levin, who has an Omnitrix of his own, called the \"AntiTrix\", which gives him access to altered versions of Ben's aliens. A mysterious villain called the Forever Knight gathers up Ben's villains for a common cause. As revealed in the two-part finale ''Roundabout'', his goal is to go back in time and prevent alien signals from contacting Earth.\n\nThroughout the season, the Forever Knight tests Team Tennyson's enemies to determine those he needs for this goal: the final roster consist of Kevin, Charmcaster, Vin Ethanol, Billy Billions, Simon Sez, and a delusional Ben. While searching for Ben, Phil gifts Gwen with a robot cat suit. Kevin, angry at the Forever Knight for discarding him, teams up with Gwen to help Ben prevent the Forever Knight from altering history. In the end, both Kevin and the Knight end up trapped through time and space.\n\nBen and Gwen make it back to the present and head back to America aboard the Omni-Copter alongside Grandpa Max, Phil, Vin, and Simon, the latter two being convinced to join Team Tennyson. Also, Billy and Charmcaster get taken into custody.\n\n=== Season 4 (2020) ===\n\nIn the start of Season 4, Ben's Omnitrix is unlocked in a armored version in which he unlocks Jetray ,who replaces Stinkfly . Kevin's AntiTrix is on a different armored version of it, unlocking Ultimate Kevin, a powerful version of Kevin (voiced by Greg Cipes).\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Ben 10 characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Ben Tennyson]] (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) \u2013 The ten-year-old cousin of Gwen and grandson of Max Tennyson.

While Temoc's original name was [[Cannabis smoking|\"Blaze\"]] and was created on the same day that [[420 (cannabis culture)|4/20]] is observed, Aryanpur claims that any marijuana references were merely coincidental. However, it is more likely that the UTD administration only recorded their mascot's adoption month (not the day) & did not plan Temoc's birthday events consistently in advance, resulting in various April days being used for the first 21 years.\n\n== Failed Eliminations ==\n\n=== 1st Attempt ===\nStudents, faculty, staff, and alumni began discussion of eliminating the Temoc character (while keeping the ''Comets'' as the student body nickname) in the 2007-2008 academic year.<ref name=\"utdallas.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/2008/05/22-003.php|title=Comet Character Shines Brightest in UT Dallas Mascot Survey|website=www.utdallas.edu|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref> An initial poll was sent out and early write-in options included an astronaut, robot, greyhound, and a \u201c[[Wesley Crusher|Crusher]]\u201d character. Soon after, the university had begun promoting April 3, 2008 as \"Temoc's Final Birthday\". In the end, the final poll gave 4 options: a fox, hawk, coyote, or a comet character.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/2008/04/18-002.html|title=Mascot Proposals Submitted for Campus-Wide Consideration at UT Dallas|website=www.utdallas.edu|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/ut-dallas-needs-a-new-mascot-pronto-7123944|title=UT Dallas Needs a New Mascot, Pronto|last=Wilonsky|first=Robert|date=2008-05-01|website=Dallas Observer|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref> \"Comet character\" won the majority with 50% of the vote, so Temoc continued to remain as the UTD mascot.<ref name=\"utdallas.edu\"/><ref>{{Citation|last=UTD TV|first=|title=Busy Being Born: The UT Dallas Story - 16:22|date=2018-10-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xexy9iwXDP8&t=982|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/alumnilink/2008/june/feature.html|title=June 2008 Alumni Link - Featured Story|website=www.utdallas.edu|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref>\n\n=== 2nd Attempt ===\n\nIn 2009, the Student Government started another campaign to replace mascot. An initial poll concluded that over 70% of students wanted choose a new mascot, which became a clear indication of Temoc's unpopularity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/17al9z/why_couldnt_they_come_up_with_a_better_name_for/c84phvy|title=r/utdallas - Why couldn't they come up with a better name for the mascot?, comment|last=Hinojosa|first=Nick|date=2013|website=reddit|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of a lengthy exploratory research, a final poll created by a special council was given to the student body. Students were given the option to vote to keep Temoc or to change the mascot to a man in a spacesuit. Temoc won the poll by a landslide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/2009/02/11-001.php|title=Mascot Wins Decisive Victory Over Challenger - UT Dallas News|website=www.utdallas.edu|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref> However, Temoc's win was mainly attributed to confusion based the spaceman's poor illustration - not the desire to keep the original mascot around.\n\nSo far, new alternative mascot options have been a result of failed bureaucratic compromises rather than actual student popularity. Eliminating Temoc in the future is still a strong possibility.\n\n== Backwards Naming Conventions at UTD ==\n[[File:Tower Cranes.JPG|left|thumb|132x132px|Construction Crane]]\n\n=== Temoc ===\n\nTemoc is \"comet\" spelled backwards. While the UT Dallas student body had been collectively referred to as the \"comets\" well before the mascot's official creation in 1998, Temoc officially solidified the college's association with the astronomical symbol.\n\nThe name \"Temoc\" was created and chosen by UTD's 2002 Student Body Government. The group had hastily compromised on writing the mascot's new name as \"comet\" backwards because they were under pressure to quickly come up with an alternative name to replace the original (Blaze) on a short notice (due to a legal warning from UT Arlington).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThis decision was regarded as incredibly uncreative - a consequence largely attributed by the fact that the majority of the student population was majoring in a STEM area (as opposed to the arts) at the time. As a result, the student body now often refers to various points of interest on campus by their backwards spelling. Essentially, poking fun at Temoc's ridiculous name is the sole reason why UT Dallas students still utilize backwards names to this day.\n\n=== Enarc ===\n\nEnarc is \"crane\" spelled backwards. It refers to any [[Crane (machine)|construction crane]] that resides on the main campus. Because UT Dallas has been in a period of rapid growth and development in the past decade, cranes have become an iconic moving landmark on campus. Many students will passionately proclaim Enarc as the \"true\" mascot;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://utdmercury.com/enarc/|title=Enarc|last=Mercury|first=The|date=2015-11-16|website=The Mercury|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref> a trend which grew after online communities popularized support of Enarc around 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Enarc/|title=r/Enarc|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://enarcmerch.com/|title=ENARC MERCH|website=Enarc Merch|language=en|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customink.com/fundraising/enarc|title=Click here to support Hack To Help at UTD for materials for events and workshops including snacks, t-shirts, stickers, and more|website=www.customink.com|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref> However, the term has been rumored to have been first used as early as 2009 or 2010.\n\nCranes are also considered to be an ironic deity - \"Praise Enarc\", \"Blessed be the one who rises above us\", and \"May Enarc lift up our GPAs\" are common phrases associated with the faux mascot.\n\n=== Tobor ===\n\nTobor is \"robot\" spelled backwards.

Other mascot submissions included: Aardvarks, Crickets, Fighting Cocks, Rattlers, Wolves, Scorpions, Possums, Chipmunks, Buzzards, Demons, Sludge Monsters, Gladiators, [[Klingon]]s, Toros, Rangers, Wranglers, [[Sagebrush Rebellion|Sagebrush Rebels]], [[Chaparral]]s, Androids, Creatures from the UTD Lagoon, [[Texas Instruments]], Space Cadets, Fat Cats, Roadsters, Prisoners, Commuters, [[Texas A&M University|Aggies]], Thermometers, and Graduates. Official tallies of the final vote was not published. \"Comets\" was one of the top 3 most popular options selected by the student body and it was ultimately selected by the special committee to be officially adopted as the athletic name.\n\nWhile the exact origins behind the \"Comets\" mascot name is unknown, ''The Mercury'' published that it was influenced by \"[university] activities accented heavily by space research\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://utd-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/10735.1/2251/OSA-MERC-1981-0126.pdf|title=Sports Team Gets A Name; UTD Comets|last=|first=|date=1981|work=UTD Mercury|access-date=2020-01-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nUT Dallas' involvement with space research was largely supported by the first UTD President, Dr. Francis \"Frank\" Johnson. He noted that out of the main three departments that existed back in 1961-68 (Geosciences, Molecular Biology, and Space & Atmospheric Physics), space research was the easiest to secure government grants for while all other areas heavily relied on dwindling private philanthropy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/2009/09/18-003.php|title=University's First Leader Frank Johnson Dies at 92 - UT Dallas News|website=www.utdallas.edu|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://utdallas.edu/development/faces/frank-and-maurine-johnson/|title=Frank and Maurine Johnson - The University of Texas at Dallas|language=en|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/create/transcripts/frank-johnson.html|title=Frank Johnson - Transcripts - Creating the Future Since 1969 - The University of Texas at Dallas|website=www.utdallas.edu|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> Dr. Johnson claimed that without initial funds received from [[NASA]] (largely fueled by the USA vs USSR [[Cold War]] [[Space Race]]), the fledgling university would have not been able to secure enough financial resources to continue to operate. Successful space research and collaborations helped legitimize the young graduate center's value and eventually gained enough support from Texas legislature to bring it under official state support by adding the institution to the [[University of Texas System]] in 1969.\n\n=== Notable Space Research at UTD ===\nSince its founding, [[astrophysics]] and [[space research]] has played a key role in UT Dallas' early research prowess and is intertwined with many of the college's traditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/magazine/across-space-and-time/|title=Across Space And Time - UT Dallas Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/science-technology/moon-landing-space-utd-50th-2019/|title=From UTD to the Moon and Beyond: 50 Years and Counting|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> Several UTD faculty members and alumni's groundbreaking contributions to space science helped develop the university's current space-themed school spirit.\n\n* Dr. James L. Carter was one of the UT Dallas geoscientists that trained [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts to spot interesting geology on the moon and also analyzed the lunar samples that came back. He created [[lunar regolith simulant]] (aka fake \"moon dirt\"), which is so chemically, mineralogically, and textually similar to the real thing that the two are practically indistinguishable. NASA has ordered over 50 tons of the material to use for testing space equipment and other research projects. All UTD class rings are surrounded by the same lunar regolith simulant material the night before the official Ring Ceremony to symbolize the university\u2019s past and future.\n* Dr. James Reilly was the first UT Dallas alumni to become an astronaut for NASA. He has spent a combined 853 hours in space, including five spacewalks lasting more than 31 hours during which he helped assemble the [[International Space Station]]. Upon returning from his final mission, Reilly presented UTD a framed collage commemorating the flight along with a UT Dallas flag that made the trip to space. The gifts are currently displayed on the 4th floor of UT Dallas' Eugene McDermott Library.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/magazine/3555/get-to-know-jim-reilly-former-nasa-astronaut/|title=Get to Know Jim Reilly BS\u201977, MS\u201987, PhD\u201995, Former NASA Astronaut|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>\n* Dr. John Hoffman designed and built mass [[spectrometer]]s and other equipment to explore Venus, the moon, and [[Halley\u2019s comet]] and played a key role in discovering the existence of [[water on Mars]].\n* Dr. Lloyd V.

While Temoc's original name was [[Cannabis smoking|\"Blaze\"]] and was created on the same day that [[420 (cannabis culture)|4/20]] is observed, Aryanpur claims that any marijuana references were merely coincidental. However, it is more likely that the UTD adminstration only recorded their mascot's adoption month (not the day) & did not plan Temoc's birthday events consistently in advance, resulting in various April days being used for the first 21 years.\n\n== Failed Eliminations ==\n\n=== 1st Attempt ===\nStudents, faculty, staff, and alumni began discussion of eliminating the Temoc character (while keeping the ''Comets'' as the student body nickname) in the 2007-2008 academic year.<ref name=\"utdallas.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/2008/05/22-003.php|title=Comet Character Shines Brightest in UT Dallas Mascot Survey|website=www.utdallas.edu|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref> An initial poll was sent out and early write-in options included an astronaut, robot, greyhound, and a \u201c[[Wesley Crusher|Crusher]]\u201d character. Soon after, the university had begun promoting April 3, 2008 as \"Temoc's Final Birthday\". In the end, the final poll gave 4 options: a fox, hawk, coyote, or a comet character.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/2008/04/18-002.html|title=Mascot Proposals Submitted for Campus-Wide Consideration at UT Dallas|website=www.utdallas.edu|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/ut-dallas-needs-a-new-mascot-pronto-7123944|title=UT Dallas Needs a New Mascot, Pronto|last=Wilonsky|first=Robert|date=2008-05-01|website=Dallas Observer|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref> \"Comet character\" won the majority with 50% of the vote, so Temoc continued to remain as the UTD mascot.<ref name=\"utdallas.edu\"/><ref>{{Citation|last=UTD TV|first=|title=Busy Being Born: The UT Dallas Story - 16:22|date=2018-10-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xexy9iwXDP8&t=982|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/alumnilink/2008/june/feature.html|title=June 2008 Alumni Link - Featured Story|website=www.utdallas.edu|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref>\n\n=== 2nd Attempt ===\n\nIn 2009, the Student Government started another campaign to replace mascot. An initial poll concluded that over 70% of students wanted choose a new mascot, which became a clear indication of Temoc's unpopularity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/17al9z/why_couldnt_they_come_up_with_a_better_name_for/c84phvy|title=r/utdallas - Why couldn't they come up with a better name for the mascot?, comment|last=Hinojosa|first=Nick|date=2013|website=reddit|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of a lengthy exploratory research, a final poll created by a special council was given to the student body. Students were given the option to vote to keep Temoc or to change the mascot to a man in a spacesuit. Temoc won the poll by a landslide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/2009/02/11-001.php|title=Mascot Wins Decisive Victory Over Challenger - UT Dallas News|website=www.utdallas.edu|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref> However, Temoc's win was mainly attributed to confusion based the spaceman's poor illustration - not the desire to keep the original mascot around.\n\nSo far, new alternative mascot options have been a result of failed bureaucratic compromises rather than actual student popularity. Eliminating Temoc in the future is still a strong possibility.\n\n== Backwards Naming Conventions at UTD ==\n[[File:Tower Cranes.JPG|left|thumb|132x132px|Construction Crane]]\n\n=== Temoc ===\n\nTemoc is \"comet\" spelled backwards. While the UT Dallas student body had been collectively referred to as the \"comets\" well before the mascot's official creation in 1998, Temoc officially solidified the college's association with the astronomical symbol.\n\nThe name \"Temoc\" was created and chosen by UTD's 2002 Student Body Government. The group had hastily compromised on writing the mascot's new name as \"comet\" backwards because they were under pressure to quickly come up with an alternative name to replace the original (Blaze) on a short notice (due to a legal warning from UT Arlington).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThis decision was regarded as incredibly uncreative - a consequence largely attributed by the fact that the majority of the student population was majoring in a STEM area (as opposed to the arts) at the time. As a result, the student body now often refers to various points of interest on campus by their backwards spelling. Essentially, poking fun at Temoc's ridiculous name is the sole reason why UT Dallas students still utilize backwards names to this day.\n\n=== Enarc ===\n\nEnarc is \"crane\" spelled backwards. It refers to any [[Crane (machine)|construction crane]] that resides on the main campus. Because UT Dallas has been in a period of rapid growth and development in the past decade, cranes have become an iconic moving landmark on campus. Many students will passionately proclaim Enarc as the \"true\" mascot;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://utdmercury.com/enarc/|title=Enarc|last=Mercury|first=The|date=2015-11-16|website=The Mercury|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref> a trend which grew after online communities popularized support of Enarc around 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Enarc/|title=r/Enarc|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://enarcmerch.com/|title=ENARC MERCH|website=Enarc Merch|language=en|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customink.com/fundraising/enarc|title=Click here to support Hack To Help at UTD for materials for events and workshops including snacks, t-shirts, stickers, and more|website=www.customink.com|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref> However, the term has been rumored to have been first used as early as 2009 or 2010.\n\nCranes are also considered to be an ironic deity - \"Praise Enarc\", \"Blessed be the one who rises above us\", and \"May Enarc lift up our GPAs\" are common phrases associated with the faux mascot.\n\n=== Tobor ===\n\nTobor is \"robot\" spelled backwards.

Other mascot submissions included: Aardvarks, Crickets, Fighting Cocks, Rattlers, Wolves, Scorpions, Possums, Chipmunks, Buzzards, Demons, Sludge Monsters, Gladiators, [[Klingon]]s, Toros, Rangers, Wranglers, [[Sagebrush Rebellion|Sagebrush Rebels]], [[Chaparral]]s, Androids, Creatures from the UTD Lagoon, [[Texas Instruments]], Space Cadets, Fat Cats, Roadsters, Prisoners, Commuters, [[Texas A&M University|Aggies]], Thermometers, and Graduates. Official tallies of the final vote was not published. \"Comets\" was one of the top 3 most popular options selected by the student body and it was ultimately selected by the special committee to be officially adopted as the athletic name.\n\nWhile the exact origins behind the \"Comets\" mascot name is unknown, ''The Mercury'' published that it was influenced by \"[university] activities accented heavily by space research\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://utd-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/10735.1/2251/OSA-MERC-1981-0126.pdf|title=Sports Team Gets A Name; UTD Comets|last=|first=|date=1981|work=UTD Mercury|access-date=2020-01-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nUT Dallas' involvement with space research was largely supported by the first UTD President, Dr. Francis \"Frank\" Johnson. He noted that out of the main three departments that existed back in 1961-68 (Geosciences, Molecular Biology, and Space & Atmospheric Physics), space research was the easiest to secure government grants for while all other areas heavily relied on dwindling private philanthropy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/2009/09/18-003.php|title=University's First Leader Frank Johnson Dies at 92 - UT Dallas News|website=www.utdallas.edu|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://utdallas.edu/development/faces/frank-and-maurine-johnson/|title=Frank and Maurine Johnson - The University of Texas at Dallas|language=en|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/create/transcripts/frank-johnson.html|title=Frank Johnson - Transcripts - Creating the Future Since 1969 - The University of Texas at Dallas|website=www.utdallas.edu|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> Dr. Johnson claimed that without initial funds received from [[NASA]] (largely fueled by the USA vs USSR [[Cold War]] [[Space Race]]), the fledgling university would have not been able to secure enough financial resources to continue to operate. Successful space research and collaborations helped legitimize the young graduate center's value and eventually gained enough support from Texas legislature to bring it under official state support by adding the institution to the [[University of Texas System]] in 1969.\n\n=== Notable Space Research at UTD ===\nSince its founding, [[astrophysics]] and [[space research]] has played a key role in UT Dallas' early research prowess and is intertwined with many of the college's traditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/magazine/across-space-and-time/|title=Across Space And Time - UT Dallas Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/science-technology/moon-landing-space-utd-50th-2019/|title=From UTD to the Moon and Beyond: 50 Years and Counting|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> Several UTD faculty members and alumni's groundbreaking contributions to space science helped develop the university's current space-themed school spirit.\n\n* Dr. James L. Carter was one of the UT Dallas geoscientists that trained [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts to spot interesting geology on the moon and also analyzed the lunar samples that came back. He created [[lunar regolith simulant]] (aka fake \"moon dirt\"), which is so chemically, mineralogically, and textually similar to the real thing that the two are practically indistinguishable. NASA has ordered over 50 tons of the material to use for testing space equipment and other research projects. All UTD class rings are surrounded by the same lunar regolith simulant material the night before the official Ring Ceremony to symbolize the university\u2019s past and future.\n* Dr. James Reilly was the first UT Dallas alumni to become an astronaut for NASA. He has spent a combined 853 hours in space, including five spacewalks lasting more than 31 hours during which he helped assemble the [[International Space Station]]. Upon returning from his final mission, Reilly presented UTD a framed collage commemorating the flight along with a UT Dallas flag that made the trip to space. The gifts are currently displayed on the 4th floor of UT Dallas' Eugene McDermott Library.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/magazine/3555/get-to-know-jim-reilly-former-nasa-astronaut/|title=Get to Know Jim Reilly BS\u201977, MS\u201987, PhD\u201995, Former NASA Astronaut|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>\n* Dr. John Hoffman designed and built mass [[spectrometer]]s and other equipment to explore Venus, the moon, and [[Halley\u2019s comet]] and played a key role in discovering the existence of [[water on Mars]].\n* Dr. Lloyd V. Berkner joined the institution that would become UTD in 1961 and became well renowned in the scientific community for his studies of the Earth\u2019s [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]]. In 1966, NASA gave Berkner its highest civilian award, the [[Public Service Medal (NASA)|Public Service Medal]], for his contributions to U.S. space programs.\n* Dr. Francis S.

Widescreen [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] editions of the film, also including the hi-definition theatrical trailer, scene selections, and director's commentary among other highlights, were released in the United States on 8 January 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2057, the Sun is dying and the Earth is freezing. A crew of eight pilot a colossal nuclear bomb aboard the spaceship ''Icarus II'', with the intent to jump start the Sun, and return to Earth. As they slingshot past Mercury, ''Icarus II'' discovers the distress beacon of ''Icarus I'', the first ship to attempt a similar mission, which disappeared seven years earlier. Reasoning that two payloads have a better chance of success than one, physicist Capa recommends Captain Kaneda change course and commandeer ''Icarus I''. Mace, the ship's engineer, opposes the deviation as risky. Navigator Trey calculates and implements a trajectory to intercept ''Icarus I'', but forgets to realign the shields that protect the ship from the sun, causing damage to four shield panels.\n\nKaneda and Capa embark on a spacewalk to make repairs, assisted by pilot Cassie, who angles the damaged portion of the shield away from the Sun. As expected, this allows the Sun to destroy the protruding communications tower; however, reflected light also destroys the ship's oxygen garden and oxygen reserves. As ''Icarus II''{{'}}s autopilot returns the shield to its original alignment, Kaneda orders Capa to safety, and Kaneda repairs the last panel, moments before he is immolated. Trey blames himself for the loss of Kaneda, and psychiatrist Searle assesses him as a suicide risk, sedating him.\n\n''Icarus II'' docks with ''Icarus I''. Capa, Searle, Mace, and former communications officer now-Captain Harvey search the vessel, leaving Cassie and botanist Corazon on board ''Icarus II''. They discover ''Icarus I''{{'}}s mainframe has been sabotaged, making its bomb delivery impossible. In the ship's log is a rambling message from Captain Pinbacker, who abandoned his mission. The crew of ''Icarus I'' is found charred to death in the solar observation room, where they were long ago exposed to the unshielded Sun. Suddenly, the two ships explosively decouple, destroying ''Icarus I''{{'}}s outer airlock, stranding the four crew members on it. With only one spacesuit, Mace suggests that Capa wear it and the rest of them wrap themselves in salvaged insulation material and then jettison between airlocks, using the vacuum release for propulsion. Searle then points out that one of them must stay behind to manually operate the airlock and volunteers to do it. Searle releases the airlock and the three crew members rocket into space. Harvey misses the airlock and freezes to death, while Capa and Mace make it back to ''Icarus II''. Searle, having spent the mission obsessed with looking into the shielded sun, voluntarily exposes himself to its full, deadly force in the observation room.\n\nCorazon calculates that there is enough oxygen left for four of the five survivors to reach the Sun. After a contentious vote, Mace decides to kill Trey, but discovers Trey has already, seemingly, committed suicide. With the remaining crew somewhat relieved that they will now at least make the trip to the Sun, Capa is informed by ''Icarus'' that there is still not enough oxygen to complete the mission, because an unknown fifth person is on board the ship. When Capa investigates, he discovers an insane and disfigured Pinbacker (who presumably killed Trey). Pinbacker attacks and wounds Capa and locks him in an airlock. He then kills Corazon and removes the mainframe from its coolant bath, shutting down the computer. He then pursues Cassie.\n\nMace attempts to manually lower the computer back into the freezing coolant, but when his leg catches on the descending computer he becomes trapped, and the computer is disabled. As he freezes to death, he begs Capa to complete the mission. Capa blows the airlock, separates the bomb from the ship, which explodes, and enters the payload, where he finds Cassie.

A crew of eight pilot a colossal nuclear bomb aboard the spaceship ''Icarus II'', with the intent to jump start the Sun, and return to Earth. As they slingshot past Mercury, ''Icarus II'' discovers the distress beacon of ''Icarus I'', the first ship to attempt a similar mission, which disappeared seven years earlier. Reasoning that two payloads have a better chance of success than one, physicist Capa recommends Captain Kaneda change course and commandeer ''Icarus I''. Mace, the ship's engineer, opposes the deviation as risky. Navigator Trey calculates and implements a trajectory to intercept ''Icarus I'', but forgets to realign the shields that protect the ship from the sun, causing damage to four shield panels.\n\nKaneda and Capa embark on a spacewalk to make repairs, assisted by pilot Cassie, who angles the damaged portion of the shield away from the Sun. As expected, this allows the Sun to destroy the protruding communications tower; however, reflected light also destroys the ship's oxygen garden and oxygen reserves. As ''Icarus II''{{'}}s autopilot returns the shield to its original alignment, Kaneda orders Capa to safety, and Kaneda repairs the last panel, moments before he is immolated. Trey blames himself for the loss of Kaneda, and psychiatrist Searle assesses him as a suicide risk, sedating him.\n\n''Icarus II'' docks with ''Icarus I''. Capa, Searle, Mace, and former communications officer now-Captain Harvey search the vessel, leaving Cassie and botanist Corazon on board ''Icarus II''. They discover ''Icarus I''{{'}}s mainframe has been sabotaged, making its bomb delivery impossible. In the ship's log is a rambling message from Captain Pinbacker, who abandoned his mission. The crew of ''Icarus I'' is found charred to death in the solar observation room, where they were long ago exposed to the unshielded Sun. Suddenly, the two ships explosively decouple, destroying ''Icarus I''{{'}}s outer airlock, stranding the four crew members on it. With only one spacesuit, Mace suggests that Capa wear it and the rest of them wrap themselves in salvaged insulation material and then jettison between airlocks, using the vacuum release for propulsion. Searle then points out that one of them must stay behind to manually operate the airlock and volunteers to do it. Searle releases the airlock and the three crew members rocket into space. Harvey misses the airlock and freezes to death, while Capa and Mace make it back to ''Icarus II''. Searle, having spent the mission obsessed with looking into the shielded sun, voluntarily exposes himself to its full, deadly force in the observation room.\n\nCorazon calculates that there is enough oxygen left for four of the five survivors to reach the Sun. After a contentious vote, Mace decides to kill Trey, but discovers Trey has already, seemingly, committed suicide. With the remaining crew somewhat relieved that they will now at least make the trip to the Sun, Capa is informed by ''Icarus'' that there is still not enough oxygen to complete the mission, because an unknown fifth person is on board the ship. When Capa investigates, he discovers an insane and disfigured Pinbacker (who presumably killed Trey). Pinbacker attacks and wounds Capa and locks him in an airlock. He then kills Corazon and removes the mainframe from its coolant bath, shutting down the computer. He then pursues Cassie.\n\nMace attempts to manually lower the computer back into the freezing coolant, but when his leg catches on the descending computer he becomes trapped, and the computer is disabled. As he freezes to death, he begs Capa to complete the mission. Capa blows the airlock, separates the bomb from the ship, which explodes, and enters the payload, where he finds Cassie. Pinbacker ambushes them, telling them God ordered him to send all humanity to [[Heaven]]. As they hurtle into the Sun, Capa escapes Pinbacker, reaching the bomb controls. Unsure if it will work under these extreme conditions, he watches as the bomb begins to successfully ignite at the edge of the Sun itself.\n\nBack on the frozen [[Sydney Harbour]], Capa's sister witnesses the Sun returning to its full power.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Cillian Murphy 2010.jpg|thumb|155px|right|Actor Cillian Murphy who portrayed physicist Robert Capa]]\n* [[Cillian Murphy]] as Robert Capa, the physicist who operates the massive stellar-bomb device.

The indigenous people who inhabit the islands of Polynesia are termed [[Polynesians]], sharing many similar traits including [[Polynesian languages|language family]], [[Polynesian culture|culture]], and [[Marae|beliefs]].<ref name=trh/> Historically, they had a strong tradition of sailing and [[Polynesian navigation|using stars to navigate]] at night. The largest country in Polynesia is [[New Zealand]].\n\nThe term ''Polyn\u00e9sie'' was first used in 1756 by French writer [[Charles de Brosses]], originally applied to all the [[Pacific islands|islands of the Pacific]]. In 1831, [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] proposed a restriction on its use during a lecture to the Geographical Society of Paris. Historically, the islands of the [[South Seas]] have been known as '''South Sea Islands'''.<ref>Russell, Michael (1849). ''Polynesia: A History of the South Sea Islands, including New Zealand''.</ref> Their inhabitants have been known as [[South Sea Islanders]], even though the [[Hawaiian Islands]] are located in the [[North Pacific]]. Another term, the [[Polynesian Triangle]], explicitly includes the Hawaiian Islands, as they form its northern [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]].\n\n==Geography==\n===Geology===\n[[File:Moorea baie cook.JPG|thumb|Cook's Bay on [[Moorea]], [[French Polynesia]]]]\n[[File:Mokoli\u02bbi Insel.jpg|thumb|Mokoli\u02bbi Isle near [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]]]]\nPolynesia is characterized by a small amount of land spread over a very large portion of the mid and southern [[Pacific Ocean]]. Most Polynesian islands and [[archipelago]]s, including the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and [[Samoan Islands|Samoa]], are composed of volcanic islands built by [[hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] (volcanoes). [[New Zealand]], [[Norfolk Island]], and [[Ouv\u00e9a]], the Polynesian outlier near [[New Caledonia]], are the unsubmerged portions of the largely sunken continent of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]]. Zealandia is believed to have mostly sunk 23 million years ago and recently resurfaced geologically due to a change in the movements of the [[Pacific Plate]] in relation to the [[Indo-Australian plate]], which served to uplift the New Zealand portion. At first, the Pacific plate was subducted under the Australian plate. The [[Alpine Fault]] that traverses the South Island is currently a [[transform fault]] while the convergent plate boundary from the North Island northwards is called the [[Kermadec-Tonga Subduction Zone]]. The volcanism associated with this [[subduction zone]] is the origin of the [[Kermadec Islands|Kermadec]] and [[Tonga]]n island archipelagos.\n\nOut of approximately {{convert|117000|or|118000|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} of land, over {{convert|103000|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} are within [[New Zealand]]; the Hawaiian archipelago comprises about half the remainder. The Zealandia continent has approximately {{convert|1400000|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} of continental shelf. The oldest rocks in the region are found in New Zealand and are believed to be about 510 million years old. The oldest Polynesian rocks outside of Zealandia are to be found in the Hawaiian Emperor Seamount Chain and are 80 million years old.\n\n===Geographic area===\nPolynesia is generally defined as the islands within the [[Polynesian Triangle]], although some islands inhabited by [[Polynesian people]] are situated outside the Polynesian Triangle. Geographically, the Polynesian Triangle is drawn by connecting the points of [[Hawaii]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Easter Island]]. The other main island groups located within the Polynesian Triangle are [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], the [[Cook Islands]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Tokelau]], [[Niue]], [[Wallis and Futuna]] and [[French Polynesia]].\n\nAlso, small Polynesian settlements are in [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Caroline Islands]] and [[Vanuatu]]. An island group with strong Polynesian cultural traits outside of this great triangle is [[Rotuma]], situated north of [[Fiji]]. The people of Rotuma have many common Polynesian traits, but speak a non-[[Polynesian language]]. Some of the [[Lau Islands]] to the southeast of Fiji have strong historic and cultural links with Tonga.

Linguistically, there is a very distinct \"East Polynesian\" subgroup with many shared innovations not seen in other Polynesian languages. The Marquesas dialects are perhaps the source of the oldest Hawaiian speech which is overlaid by Tahitian variety speech, as Hawaiian oral histories would suggest. The earliest varieties of New Zealand Maori speech may have had multiple sources from around central Eastern Polynesia as Maori oral histories would suggest.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n===Political history===\n\n====Tonga 10th century====\n\nIn the 10th century, the [[Tu'i Tonga Empire]] was established in Tonga, and most of the Western Pacific came within its sphere of influence, up to parts of the [[Soloman Islands|Solomon Islands]]. The Tongan influence brought Polynesian customs and language throughout most of [[Polynesia]]. The empire began to decline in the 13th century.\n\n====Tonga 16th century\u2013present====\nAfter a bloody civil war, political power in Tonga eventually fell under the [[Tu'i Kanokupolu]] dynasty in the 16th century.\n\nIn 1845 the ambitious young warrior, strategist, and orator [[George Tupou I|T\u0101ufa\u02bb\u0101hau]] united Tonga into a more Western-style kingdom. He held the chiefly title of Tu\u02bbi Kanokupolu, but had been baptised with the name Jiaoji (\"George\") in 1831. In 1875, with the help of the missionary [[Shirley Waldemar Baker]], he declared Tonga a constitutional monarchy, formally adopted the western royal style, emancipated the \"serfs\", enshrined a code of law, land tenure, and freedom of the press, and limited the power of the chiefs.\n\nTonga became a British-protected state under a Treaty of Friendship on 18 May 1900, when European settlers and rival Tongan chiefs tried to oust the second king. Within the British Empire, which posted no higher permanent representative on Tonga than a British Consul (1901\u20131970), Tonga formed part of the [[British Western Pacific Territories]] (under a colonial High Commissioner, residing in Fiji) from 1901 until 1952. Despite being under the protectorate, Tonga retained its monarchy without interruption.\n\nOn June 4, 1970 the [[Kingdom of Tonga]] received independence from the British protectorate.\n\n====Samoa Tui Manu'a and Malietoa\u2013present====\nSamoa has a long history of various ruling families, the oldest of which is the Tui Manu'a, and the most recent of which is the Malietoa, until its East-West division by [[Tripartite Convention (1899)]] subsequent annexation by the [[German Empire]] and the United States. The German-controlled Western portion of Samoa (consisting of the bulk of Samoan territory) was occupied by New Zealand in WWI, and administered by it under a Class C [[League of Nations Mandate]] until receiving independence on January 1, 1962. The new Independent State of Samoa was not a monarchy, though the Malietoa title-holder remained very influential. It officially ended, however with the death of [[Malietoa Tanumafili II]] on May 11, 2007.\n\n====Tahiti====\n{{Main|Pomare Dynasty}}\n\n====Hawaii====\n[[File:Two natives with outrigger canoes at shoreline, Honolulu, Hawaii.jpg|thumb|Polynesians with [[outrigger canoe]]s at [[Waikiki beach]], [[Oahu]] Island, early 20th century]]{{Main|Kingdom of Hawaii}}\n\n====New Zealand M\u0101ori====\n{{main|M\u0101ori people}}\nOn October 28, 1835 members of the [[Ng\u0101puhi]] and surrounding M\u0101ori tribes ([[iwi]]) issued a \"declaration of independence\", as a \"confederation of tribes\" to resist potential French colonization efforts and to prevent the ships and cargo of M\u0101ori merchants from being seized at foreign ports. They received recognition from the British monarch in 1836. (See [[United Tribes of New Zealand]], [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand|New Zealand Declaration of Independence]], [[James Busby]].)\n\nUsing the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] and [[Terra nullius|right of discovery]] as a basis, the [[United Kingdom]] annexed New Zealand as a part of [[New South Wales]] in 1840.\n\nIn response to the actions of the colonial government, M\u0101ori looked to form a monarchy inclusive of all M\u0101ori tribes in order to reduce vulnerability to the British divide-and-conquer strategy. [[P\u014dtatau Te Wherowhero]], high priest and chief of the [[Ng\u0101ti Mahuta]] tribe of the [[Waikato]] iwi, was crowned as the M\u0101ori king in 1858. The king's territory consisted primarily of the lands in the center of the North Island, and the iwi constituted the most powerful non-signatories of the Treaty of Waitangi, with Te Wherowhero also never having signed it.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Treaty of Waitangi|url=http://www.history-nz.org/colonisation2.html|work=The colonisation of New Zealand|accessdate=20 September 2011}}</ref>  (See [[Kingitanga]].)\n\nAll tribes were incorporated into rule under the colonial government by the late 19th century. Although M\u0101ori were given the privilege of being legally enfranchised subjects of the British Empire under the Treaty, [[M\u0101ori culture]] and [[M\u0101ori language|language]] (te reo M\u0101ori) were actively suppressed by the colonial government and by economic and social pressures from the [[Pakeha]] society. Efforts were made to preserve indigenous culture starting in the late 1950s and culminating in the [[Waitangi Tribunal]]'s interpretation of language and culture being included in the treasures set to be preserved under the Treaty of Waitangi. Moving from a low point of 15,000 speakers in the 1970s, there are now over 157,000 people who have some proficiency in the standard M\u0101ori language according to the 2006 census<ref>[http://www.socialreport.msd.govt.nz/cultural-identity/maori-language-speakers.html \"M\u0101ori language speakers\"], msd.govt.nz</ref> in New Zealand, due in large part to government recognition and promotion of the language.\n\n====Fiji====\n{{See also|History of Fiji|Seru Epenisa Cakobau|Fiji during the time of Cakobau}}\nThe Lau islands were subject to periods of Tongan rulership and then Fijian control until their eventual conquest by Seru Epenisa Cakobau of the Kingdom of Fiji by 1871. In around 1855 a Tongan prince, [[Enele Ma'afu]], proclaimed the Lau islands as his kingdom, and took the title [[Tui Lau]].\n\nFiji had been ruled by numerous divided chieftains until Cakobau unified the landmass. The Lapita culture, the ancestors of the Polynesians, existed in Fiji from about 3500 BCE until they were displaced by the Melanesians about a thousand years later. (Both Samoans and subsequent Polynesian cultures adopted Melanesian painting and tattoo methods.)\n\nIn 1873, Cakobau ceded a Fiji heavily indebted to foreign creditors to the United Kingdom. It became independent on 10 October 1970 and a republic on 28 September 1987.\n\n====Cook Islands====\n{{See also|History of the Cook Islands}}\nThe Cook Islands is made up of 15 islands comprising the Northern and Southern groups. The islands are spread out across many kilometers of a vast ocean. The largest of these islands is called Rarotonga, which is also the political and economic capital of the nation.\n\nThe Cook Islands were formerly known as the Hervey Islands, but this name refers only to the Northern Groups. It is unknown when this name was changed to reflect the current name. It is thought that the Cook Islands were settled in two periods: the Tahitian Period, when the country was settled between 900 - 1300 AD. The second settlement, the Maui Settlement, occurred in 1600 AD, when a large contingent from Tahiti settled in Rarotonga, in the Takitumu district.\n\nCook Islanders are ethnically Polynesians or Eastern Polynesia. They are culturally associated with Tahiti, Eastern Islands, NZ Maori and Hawaii. Early in the 17th century, became the first race to settle in New Zealand.\n\n====Tuvalu====\n{{Main|History of Tuvalu}}\n[[File:Canoe carving on Nanumea.jpg|thumb|upright|Canoe carving on [[Nanumea]] atoll, Tuvalu]]\nThe [[reef]] islands and [[atolls]] of [[Tuvalu]] are identified as being part of West Polynesia.

He claimed the \"white men\" then \"civilized\" the dark-skinned natives in Polynesia. He set out to prove this by embarking on a highly publicized [[Kon-Tiki expedition|''Kon-Tiki'' expedition]] on a primitive raft with a [[Scandinavian people|Scandinavian]] crew.

The culture of West Polynesia is conditioned to high populations. It has strong institutions of marriage and well-developed judicial, monetary and trading traditions. West Polynesia comprises the groups of [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]] and [[Fiji]]. The pattern of settlement to East Polynesia began from Samoan Islands into the Tuvaluan atolls, with [[Tuvalu]] providing a stepping stone to migration into the [[Polynesian outliers|Polynesian Outlier communities]] in [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]].<ref name=\"Belwood2\" /><ref name=\"Bayard\" /><ref name=\"Kirch\" />\n\nEastern Polynesian cultures are highly adapted to smaller islands and atolls, principally [[Niue]], the [[Cook Islands]], [[Tahiti]], the [[Tuamotus]], the [[Marquesas]], [[Hawaii]], [[Rapa Nui]] and smaller central-pacific groups. The large islands of [[New Zealand]] were first settled by Eastern Polynesians who adapted their culture to a non-tropical environment.\n\nUnlike [[Melanesia]], leaders were chosen in Polynesia based on their hereditary bloodline. Samoa, however, had another system of government that combines elements of heredity and real-world skills to choose leaders. This system is called [[Fa'amatai]]. According to Ben R. Finney and Eric M. Jones, \"On Tahiti, for example, the 35,000 Polynesians living there at the time of European discovery were divided between high-status persons with full access to food and other resources, and low-status persons with limited access.\"<ref name=\"polynesia\"/>\n[[File:TahuhuNgatiAwa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Wood carving|Carving]] from the ridgepole of a [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] house, ca 1840]]\n\nReligion, farming, fishing, weather prediction, out-rigger canoe (similar to modern [[catamaran]]s) construction and [[navigation]] were highly developed skills because the population of an entire island depended on them. Trading of both luxuries and mundane items was important to all groups. Periodic droughts and subsequent famines often led to war.<ref name=\"polynesia\">Finney, Ben R. and Jones, Eric M. (1986). \"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iKnaLbRtQasC&pg=PA176 Interstellar Migration and the Human Experience]''\". [[University of California Press]]. p.176. {{ISBN|0-520-05898-4}}</ref> Many low-lying islands could suffer severe famine if their gardens were poisoned by the salt from the storm-surge of a [[tropical cyclone]]. In these cases fishing, the primary source of protein, would not ease loss of [[food energy]]. Navigators, in particular, were highly respected and each island maintained a house of navigation with a canoe-building area.\n\nSettlements by the Polynesians were of two categories: the hamlet and the village. The size of the island inhabited determined whether or not a hamlet would be built. The larger [[volcanic]] islands usually had hamlets because of the many zones that could be divided across the island. Food and resources were more plentiful. These settlements of four to five houses (usually with gardens) were established so that there would be no overlap between the zones. Villages, on the other hand, were built on the coasts of smaller islands and consisted of thirty or more houses\u2014in the case of atolls, on only one of the group so that food cultivation was on the others. Usually these villages were fortified with walls and palisades made of stone and wood.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1995</ref>\n\nHowever, New Zealand demonstrates the opposite: large volcanic islands with fortified villages.\n\nAs well as being great navigators, these people [[Polynesian art|were artists and artisans]] of great skill. Simple objects, such as fish-hooks would be manufactured to exacting standards for different catches and decorated even when the decoration was not part of the function. Stone and wooden weapons were considered to be more powerful the better they were made and decorated. In some island groups weaving was a strong part of the culture and gifting woven articles was an ingrained practice. Dwellings were imbued with character by the skill of their building. Body decoration and jewelry is of an international standard to this day.\n\nThe religious attributes of Polynesians were common over the whole Pacific region. While there are some differences in their spoken languages they largely have the same explanation for the creation of the earth and sky, for the gods that rule aspects of life and for the religious practices of everyday life. People traveled thousands of miles to celebrations that they all owned communally.\n\nBeginning in the 1820s large numbers of missionaries worked in the islands, converting many groups to Christianity. Polynesia, argues Ian Breward,  is now \"one of the most strongly Christian regions in the world....Christianity was rapidly and successfully incorporated into Polynesian culture.  War and slavery disappeared.\"<ref>Ian Breward in {{cite book|last1=Farhadian|first1=Charles E.|last2=Hefner|first2=Robert W.|title=Introducing World Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6qjCRE85QjYC&pg=PA228|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|pages=218\u201329|isbn=9781405182485}}; quote at p 228</ref>\n\n==Languages==\n{{main|Polynesian languages}}\nPolynesian languages are all members of the family of [[Oceanic languages]], a sub-branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family. Polynesian languages show a considerable degree of similarity. The [[vowels]] are generally the same\u2014a, e, i, o, and u, pronounced as in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]]\u2014and the consonants are always followed by a vowel. The languages of various island groups show changes in [[consonant]]s. ''R'' and ''v'' are used in central and eastern Polynesia whereas ''l'' and ''v'' are used in western Polynesia. The [[glottal stop]] is increasingly represented by an inverted comma or [[\u2018okina]]. In the [[Society Islands]], the original [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] *''k'' and *''ng'' have merged as glottal stop; so the name for the ancestral homeland, deriving from Proto-Nuclear Polynesian ''*sawaiki'',<ref name=\"pollexSawaiki\">{{cite web|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/sawaiki/ |title=Polynesian Lexicon Project Online |publisher=Pollex.org.nz }}</ref> becomes Havai'i. In New Zealand, where the original *''w'' is used instead of ''v'', the ancient home is [[Hawaiki]]. In the Cook Islands, where the glottal stop replaces the original *''s'' (with a likely intermediate stage of *''h''), it is \u2018Avaiki. In the Hawaiian islands, where the glottal stop replaces the original ''k'', the largest island of the group is named Hawai\u2018i. In Samoa, where the original ''s'' is used instead of ''h'', ''v'' replaces ''w'', and the glottal stop replaces the original ''k'', the largest island is called [[Savai'i]].<ref name=trh>{{cite book\n|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucViki-t1-body-d1-d7.html\n|work=NZ Electronic Text Centre, Victoria University, NZ Licence CC-BY-SA 3.0\n|title=Vikings of the Sunrise\n|first=Te Rangi (Sir Peter Henry Buck)\n|last=Hiroa\n|page=67\n|year=1964|edition=reprint\n|publisher=Whitcombe and Tombs Ltd.\n|isbn=\n|accessdate=2 March 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nWith the exception of New Zealand, the majority of independent Polynesian islands derive much of their income from foreign aid and remittances from those who live in other countries. Some encourage their young people to go where they can earn good money to remit to their stay-at-home relatives. Many Polynesian locations, such as [[Easter Island]], supplement this with tourism income. Some have more unusual sources of income, such as [[Tuvalu]] which marketed its '[[.tv]]' internet top-level domain name or the Cooks that relied on [[postage stamp]] sales.\n\n[[File:Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi]], [[Prime Minister of Samoa]], who initiated the [[Polynesian Leaders Group]] in late 2011.]]\n\n==Inter-Polynesian cooperation==\nThe first major attempt at uniting the Polynesian islands was by [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in the 1930s, when various theorists (chiefly [[Hachir\u014d Arita]]) began promulgating the idea of what would soon become known as the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Under the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, all nations stretching from [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[Northeast Asia]] to [[Oceania]] would be united under one, large, cultural and economic bloc which would be free from [[Western imperialism]]. The policy theorists who conceived it, along with the Japanese public, largely saw it as a pan-Asian movement driven by ideals of freedom and independence from Western colonial oppression. In practice, however, it was frequently corrupted by militarists who saw it as an effective policy vehicle through which to strengthen Japan's position and advance its dominance within Asia. At its greatest extent, it stretched from [[Japanese coup d'\u00e9tat in French Indochina|Japanese occupied Indochina]] in the west to the [[Gilbert Islands]] in the east, although it was originally planned to stretch as far east as [[Hawai'i]] and [[Easter Island]] and as far west as [[India]]. This never came to fruition, however, as Japan was defeated during [[World War II]] and subsequently lost all power and influence it had.<ref>Tolland, John.

The area from the Hawaiian Islands in the north, to Easter Island in the east and to New Zealand in the south were all settled by Polynesians.\n\n[[Navigator]]s traveled to small inhabited islands using only their own senses and knowledge passed by [[oral tradition]] from navigator to apprentice. In order to locate directions at various times of day and year, navigators in Eastern Polynesia memorized important facts: the motion of specific [[star]]s, and where they would rise on the [[horizon]] of the ocean; [[weather]]; times of travel; wildlife species (which congregate at particular positions); directions of swells on the ocean, and how the crew would feel their motion; colors of the sea and sky, especially how clouds would cluster at the locations of some islands; and angles for approaching harbors.\n\n[[File:Priests traveling across kealakekua bay for first contact rituals.jpg|thumb|right|Polynesian (Hawaiian) navigators sailing multi-hulled [[canoe]], ca 1781]]\n[[File:Va'a canoe, Matavai village, Savaii, Samoa MS.JPG|thumb|right|A common fishing canoe ''va'a'' with outrigger in [[Savai'i]] island, [[Samoa]], 2009]]\nThese [[wayfinding]] techniques, along with [[outrigger]] [[canoe]] construction methods, were kept as [[guild]] secrets.

This left the problem of accounting for the presence of the Polynesians in such isolated and scattered parts of the Pacific. By the late 19th century to the early 20th century a more generous view of Polynesian navigation had come into favor, perhaps creating a romantic picture of their canoes, seamanship and navigational expertise.\n\nIn the mid to late 1960s, scholars began testing sailing and paddling experiments related to Polynesian navigation: [[David Henry Lewis|David Lewis]] sailed his catamaran from Tahiti to New Zealand using [[stellar navigation]] without instruments and [[Ben Finney]] built a 12-meter (40-foot) replica of a Hawaiian double canoe \"Nalehia\" and tested it in Hawaii.<ref>Lewis, David. [http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/?wid=4479 \"A Return Voyage Between Puluwat and Saipan Using Micronesian Navigational Techniques\"]. In Ben R. Finney (1976), ''Pacific Navigation and Voyaging'', The Polynesian Society Inc.</ref> Meanwhile, Micronesian ethnographic research in the Caroline Islands revealed that traditional stellar navigational methods were still in every day use. Recent re-creations of Polynesian voyaging have used methods based largely on Micronesian methods and the teachings of a Micronesian navigator, [[Mau Piailug]].\n\nIt is probable that the Polynesian navigators employed a whole range of techniques including use of the stars, the movement of ocean currents and wave patterns, the air and sea interference patterns caused by islands and [[atoll]]s, the flight of birds, the winds and the weather. Scientists think that long-distance Polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of [[bird migration|birds]]. There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds and some say that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with these [[flyway]]s. One theory is that they would have taken a [[frigatebird]] with them. These birds refuse to land on the water as their feathers will become waterlogged making it impossible to fly. When the voyagers thought they were close to land they may have released the bird, which would either fly towards land or else return to the canoe. It is likely that the Polynesians also used wave and swell formations to navigate. It is thought that the Polynesian navigators may have measured the time it took to sail between islands in \"canoe-days\u2019\u2019 or a similar type of expression.\n\nAlso, people of the Marshall Islands used special devices called [[Marshall Islands stick chart|stick charts]], showing the places and directions of swells and wave-breaks, with tiny seashells affixed to them to mark the positions of islands along the way. Materials for these maps were readily available on beaches, and their making was simple; however, their effective use needed years and years of study.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ethnomath.org/resources/bryan1938.pdf|title=Marshall Islands Stick Chart|last=Bryan|first=E.H.|year=1938|journal=Paradise of the Pacific|volume=50|pages=12\u201313|issue=7|access-date=2008-05-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604091519/http://www.ethnomath.org/resources/bryan1938.pdf|archive-date=2011-06-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n<!-- {{Wikipedia-Books}} -->\n<!-- {{main|Outline of Polynesia|Index of Polynesia-related articles}} -->\n<!-- * [[Bibliography of Polynesia]] -->\n* [[List of Polynesians]]\n* [[Polynesian mythology]]\n* [[Polynesian Society]]\n* [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]]\n* [[:Category:Films set in Polynesia|Films set in Polynesia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |author=William Ellis |title=Polynesian Researches, During a Residence of Nearly Six Years in the South Sea Islands, Volume 1 |year=1829 |publisher=Fisher, Son & Jackson |edition= |url= https://archive.org/details/polynesianresea10elligoog}}\n*{{cite book |author=William Ellis |title=Polynesian Researches, During a Residence of Nearly Six Years in the South Sea Islands, Volume 2 |year=1829 |publisher=Fisher, Son & Jackson |edition= |url= https://archive.org/details/polynesianresea12elligoog}}\n*{{cite book |author=William Ellis |title=Polynesian Researches, During a Residence of Nearly Six Years in the South Sea Islands, Volume 3 |year=1832 |publisher=Fisher, Son & Jackson |edition=Second |url= https://books.google.com/?id=aFFEAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR1}}\n* {{cite book | author=Gatty, Harold | title=Finding Your Ways Without Map or Compass | publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-486-40613-8}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons_and_category|Polynesia}}\n* [http://www.jeanhervedaude.com/Ile%20de%20Paques%20histoire%20par%20les%20timbres.htm History of Easter Island illustrated by stamps]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130501080025/http://www.abc.net.au/gnt/history/Transcripts/s1066068.htm Interview with David Lewis]\n* [http://www.tritonfilms.com/lewisreview.htm Lewis commenting on ''Spirits of the Voyage'']\n* [http://www.maori.info/ Useful introduction to Maori society, including canoe voyages]\n* [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/15/1037080913844.html Obituary: David Henry Lewis\u2014including how he came to rediscover Pacific Ocean navigation methods]\n\n{{Polynesia}}\n{{Countries and territories of Oceania}}\n{{Culture of Oceania|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Regions of the world}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Polynesia| ]]\n[[Category:Islands of Oceania]]\n[[Category:Regions of Oceania]]\n[[Category:18th-century neologisms]]\n[[Category:French words and phrases]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the wider region in the Pacific|the French collectivity|French Polynesia|the genus of moth|Polynesia (moth)|point of land in the South Orkney Islands|Polynesia Point}}\n{{other uses|Polynesian (disambiguation)}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|Subregion of Oceania}}\n[[File:Map OC-Polynesia.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Polynesia is generally defined as the islands within the [[Polynesian Triangle]].]]\n[[File:Pacific Culture Areas.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The three major cultural areas in the [[Pacific Ocean]]: [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]], and Polynesia]]\n\n'''Polynesia''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|\u02cc|p|\u0252|l|\u026a|\u02c8|n|i\u02d0|z|i|\u0259}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|\u0292|\u0259}}; from {{lang-gr|\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c2}} ''polys'' \"many\" and {{lang-gr|\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2}} ''n\u0113sos'' \"island\") is a [[subregion]] of [[Oceania]], made up of more than 1,000 [[island]]s scattered over the central and southern [[Pacific Ocean]]. The indigenous people who inhabit the islands of Polynesia are termed [[Polynesians]], sharing many similar traits including [[Polynesian languages|language family]], [[Polynesian culture|culture]], and [[Marae|beliefs]].<ref name=trh/> Historically, they had a strong tradition of sailing and [[Polynesian navigation|using stars to navigate]] at night. The largest country in Polynesia is [[New Zealand]].\n\nThe term ''Polyn\u00e9sie'' was first used in 1756 by French writer [[Charles de Brosses]], originally applied to all the [[Pacific islands|islands of the Pacific]]. In 1831, [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] proposed a restriction on its use during a lecture to the Geographical Society of Paris. Historically, the islands of the [[South Seas]] have been known as '''South Sea Islands'''.<ref>Russell, Michael (1849). ''Polynesia: A History of the South Sea Islands, including New Zealand''.</ref> Their inhabitants have been known as [[South Sea Islanders]], even though the [[Hawaiian Islands]] are located in the [[North Pacific]]. Another term, the [[Polynesian Triangle]], explicitly includes the Hawaiian Islands, as they form its northern [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]].\n\n==Geography==\n===Geology===\n[[File:Moorea baie cook.JPG|thumb|Cook's Bay on [[Moorea]], [[French Polynesia]]]]\n[[File:Mokoli\u02bbi Insel.jpg|thumb|Mokoli\u02bbi Isle near [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]]]]\nPolynesia is characterized by a small amount of land spread over a very large portion of the mid and southern [[Pacific Ocean]]. Most Polynesian islands and [[archipelago]]s, including the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and [[Samoan Islands|Samoa]], are composed of volcanic islands built by [[hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] (volcanoes). [[New Zealand]], [[Norfolk Island]], and [[Ouv\u00e9a]], the Polynesian outlier near [[New Caledonia]], are the unsubmerged portions of the largely sunken continent of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]]. Zealandia is believed to have mostly sunk 23 million years ago and recently resurfaced geologically due to a change in the movements of the [[Pacific Plate]] in relation to the [[Indo-Australian plate]], which served to uplift the New Zealand portion. At first, the Pacific plate was subducted under the Australian plate. The [[Alpine Fault]] that traverses the South Island is currently a [[transform fault]] while the convergent plate boundary from the North Island northwards is called the [[Kermadec-Tonga Subduction Zone]]. The volcanism associated with this [[subduction zone]] is the origin of the [[Kermadec Islands|Kermadec]] and [[Tonga]]n island archipelagos.\n\nOut of approximately {{convert|117000|or|118000|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} of land, over {{convert|103000|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} are within [[New Zealand]]; the Hawaiian archipelago comprises about half the remainder. The Zealandia continent has approximately {{convert|1400000|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} of continental shelf. The oldest rocks in the region are found in New Zealand and are believed to be about 510 million years old. The oldest Polynesian rocks outside of Zealandia are to be found in the Hawaiian Emperor Seamount Chain and are 80 million years old.\n\n===Geographic area===\nPolynesia is generally defined as the islands within the [[Polynesian Triangle]], although some islands inhabited by [[Polynesian people]] are situated outside the Polynesian Triangle. Geographically, the Polynesian Triangle is drawn by connecting the points of [[Hawaii]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Easter Island]]. The other main island groups located within the Polynesian Triangle are [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], the [[Cook Islands]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Tokelau]], [[Niue]], [[Wallis and Futuna]] and [[French Polynesia]].\n\nAlso, small Polynesian settlements are in [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Caroline Islands]] and [[Vanuatu]]. An island group with strong Polynesian cultural traits outside of this great triangle is [[Rotuma]], situated north of [[Fiji]]. The people of Rotuma have many common Polynesian traits, but speak a non-[[Polynesian language]]. Some of the [[Lau Islands]] to the southeast of Fiji have strong historic and cultural links with Tonga. However, in essence, Polynesia remains a cultural term referring to one of the three parts of [[Oceania]] (the others being [[Micronesia]] and [[Melanesia]]).\n\n===Island groups===\nThe following are the islands and island groups, either nations or overseas territories of former colonial powers, that are of native Polynesian culture or where archaeological evidence indicates Polynesian settlement in the past.<ref>Islands that were uninhabited at contact but which have archaeological evidence of Polynesian settlement include Norfolk Island, Pitcairn, New Zealand's [[Kermadec Islands]] and some small islands near Hawaii.</ref> Some islands of Polynesian origin are outside the general triangle that geographically defines the region.\n\n==== Core area ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The Tongan influence brought Polynesian customs and language throughout most of [[Polynesia]]. The empire began to decline in the 13th century.\n\n====Tonga 16th century\u2013present====\nAfter a bloody civil war, political power in Tonga eventually fell under the [[Tu'i Kanokupolu]] dynasty in the 16th century.\n\nIn 1845 the ambitious young warrior, strategist, and orator [[George Tupou I|T\u0101ufa\u02bb\u0101hau]] united Tonga into a more Western-style kingdom. He held the chiefly title of Tu\u02bbi Kanokupolu, but had been baptised with the name Jiaoji (\"George\") in 1831. In 1875, with the help of the missionary [[Shirley Waldemar Baker]], he declared Tonga a constitutional monarchy, formally adopted the western royal style, emancipated the \"serfs\", enshrined a code of law, land tenure, and freedom of the press, and limited the power of the chiefs.\n\nTonga became a British-protected state under a Treaty of Friendship on 18 May 1900, when European settlers and rival Tongan chiefs tried to oust the second king. Within the British Empire, which posted no higher permanent representative on Tonga than a British Consul (1901\u20131970), Tonga formed part of the [[British Western Pacific Territories]] (under a colonial High Commissioner, residing in Fiji) from 1901 until 1952. Despite being under the protectorate, Tonga retained its monarchy without interruption.\n\nOn June 4, 1970 the [[Kingdom of Tonga]] received independence from the British protectorate.\n\n====Samoa Tui Manu'a and Malietoa\u2013present====\nSamoa has a long history of various ruling families, the oldest of which is the Tui Manu'a, and the most recent of which is the Malietoa, until its East-West division by [[Tripartite Convention (1899)]] subsequent annexation by the [[German Empire]] and the United States. The German-controlled Western portion of Samoa (consisting of the bulk of Samoan territory) was occupied by New Zealand in WWI, and administered by it under a Class C [[League of Nations Mandate]] until receiving independence on January 1, 1962. The new Independent State of Samoa was not a monarchy, though the Malietoa title-holder remained very influential. It officially ended, however with the death of [[Malietoa Tanumafili II]] on May 11, 2007.\n\n====Tahiti====\n{{Main|Pomare Dynasty}}\n\n====Hawaii====\n[[File:Two natives with outrigger canoes at shoreline, Honolulu, Hawaii.jpg|thumb|Polynesians with [[outrigger canoe]]s at [[Waikiki beach]], [[Oahu]] Island, early 20th century]]{{Main|Kingdom of Hawaii}}\n\n====New Zealand M\u0101ori====\n{{main|M\u0101ori people}}\nOn October 28, 1835 members of the [[Ng\u0101puhi]] and surrounding M\u0101ori tribes ([[iwi]]) issued a \"declaration of independence\", as a \"confederation of tribes\" to resist potential French colonization efforts and to prevent the ships and cargo of M\u0101ori merchants from being seized at foreign ports. They received recognition from the British monarch in 1836. (See [[United Tribes of New Zealand]], [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand|New Zealand Declaration of Independence]], [[James Busby]].)\n\nUsing the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] and [[Terra nullius|right of discovery]] as a basis, the [[United Kingdom]] annexed New Zealand as a part of [[New South Wales]] in 1840.\n\nIn response to the actions of the colonial government, M\u0101ori looked to form a monarchy inclusive of all M\u0101ori tribes in order to reduce vulnerability to the British divide-and-conquer strategy. [[P\u014dtatau Te Wherowhero]], high priest and chief of the [[Ng\u0101ti Mahuta]] tribe of the [[Waikato]] iwi, was crowned as the M\u0101ori king in 1858. The king's territory consisted primarily of the lands in the center of the North Island, and the iwi constituted the most powerful non-signatories of the Treaty of Waitangi, with Te Wherowhero also never having signed it.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Treaty of Waitangi|url=http://www.history-nz.org/colonisation2.html|work=The colonisation of New Zealand|accessdate=20 September 2011}}</ref>  (See [[Kingitanga]].)\n\nAll tribes were incorporated into rule under the colonial government by the late 19th century. Although M\u0101ori were given the privilege of being legally enfranchised subjects of the British Empire under the Treaty, [[M\u0101ori culture]] and [[M\u0101ori language|language]] (te reo M\u0101ori) were actively suppressed by the colonial government and by economic and social pressures from the [[Pakeha]] society. Efforts were made to preserve indigenous culture starting in the late 1950s and culminating in the [[Waitangi Tribunal]]'s interpretation of language and culture being included in the treasures set to be preserved under the Treaty of Waitangi. Moving from a low point of 15,000 speakers in the 1970s, there are now over 157,000 people who have some proficiency in the standard M\u0101ori language according to the 2006 census<ref>[http://www.socialreport.msd.govt.nz/cultural-identity/maori-language-speakers.html \"M\u0101ori language speakers\"], msd.govt.nz</ref> in New Zealand, due in large part to government recognition and promotion of the language.\n\n====Fiji====\n{{See also|History of Fiji|Seru Epenisa Cakobau|Fiji during the time of Cakobau}}\nThe Lau islands were subject to periods of Tongan rulership and then Fijian control until their eventual conquest by Seru Epenisa Cakobau of the Kingdom of Fiji by 1871. In around 1855 a Tongan prince, [[Enele Ma'afu]], proclaimed the Lau islands as his kingdom, and took the title [[Tui Lau]].\n\nFiji had been ruled by numerous divided chieftains until Cakobau unified the landmass. The Lapita culture, the ancestors of the Polynesians, existed in Fiji from about 3500 BCE until they were displaced by the Melanesians about a thousand years later. (Both Samoans and subsequent Polynesian cultures adopted Melanesian painting and tattoo methods.)\n\nIn 1873, Cakobau ceded a Fiji heavily indebted to foreign creditors to the United Kingdom. It became independent on 10 October 1970 and a republic on 28 September 1987.\n\n====Cook Islands====\n{{See also|History of the Cook Islands}}\nThe Cook Islands is made up of 15 islands comprising the Northern and Southern groups. The islands are spread out across many kilometers of a vast ocean. The largest of these islands is called Rarotonga, which is also the political and economic capital of the nation.\n\nThe Cook Islands were formerly known as the Hervey Islands, but this name refers only to the Northern Groups. It is unknown when this name was changed to reflect the current name. It is thought that the Cook Islands were settled in two periods: the Tahitian Period, when the country was settled between 900 - 1300 AD. The second settlement, the Maui Settlement, occurred in 1600 AD, when a large contingent from Tahiti settled in Rarotonga, in the Takitumu district.\n\nCook Islanders are ethnically Polynesians or Eastern Polynesia. They are culturally associated with Tahiti, Eastern Islands, NZ Maori and Hawaii. Early in the 17th century, became the first race to settle in New Zealand.\n\n====Tuvalu====\n{{Main|History of Tuvalu}}\n[[File:Canoe carving on Nanumea.jpg|thumb|upright|Canoe carving on [[Nanumea]] atoll, Tuvalu]]\nThe [[reef]] islands and [[atolls]] of [[Tuvalu]] are identified as being part of West Polynesia.

Samoa, however, had another system of government that combines elements of heredity and real-world skills to choose leaders. This system is called [[Fa'amatai]]. According to Ben R. Finney and Eric M. Jones, \"On Tahiti, for example, the 35,000 Polynesians living there at the time of European discovery were divided between high-status persons with full access to food and other resources, and low-status persons with limited access.\"<ref name=\"polynesia\"/>\n[[File:TahuhuNgatiAwa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Wood carving|Carving]] from the ridgepole of a [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] house, ca 1840]]\n\nReligion, farming, fishing, weather prediction, out-rigger canoe (similar to modern [[catamaran]]s) construction and [[navigation]] were highly developed skills because the population of an entire island depended on them. Trading of both luxuries and mundane items was important to all groups. Periodic droughts and subsequent famines often led to war.<ref name=\"polynesia\">Finney, Ben R. and Jones, Eric M. (1986). \"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iKnaLbRtQasC&pg=PA176 Interstellar Migration and the Human Experience]''\". [[University of California Press]]. p.176. {{ISBN|0-520-05898-4}}</ref> Many low-lying islands could suffer severe famine if their gardens were poisoned by the salt from the storm-surge of a [[tropical cyclone]]. In these cases fishing, the primary source of protein, would not ease loss of [[food energy]]. Navigators, in particular, were highly respected and each island maintained a house of navigation with a canoe-building area.\n\nSettlements by the Polynesians were of two categories: the hamlet and the village. The size of the island inhabited determined whether or not a hamlet would be built. The larger [[volcanic]] islands usually had hamlets because of the many zones that could be divided across the island. Food and resources were more plentiful. These settlements of four to five houses (usually with gardens) were established so that there would be no overlap between the zones. Villages, on the other hand, were built on the coasts of smaller islands and consisted of thirty or more houses\u2014in the case of atolls, on only one of the group so that food cultivation was on the others. Usually these villages were fortified with walls and palisades made of stone and wood.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1995</ref>\n\nHowever, New Zealand demonstrates the opposite: large volcanic islands with fortified villages.\n\nAs well as being great navigators, these people [[Polynesian art|were artists and artisans]] of great skill. Simple objects, such as fish-hooks would be manufactured to exacting standards for different catches and decorated even when the decoration was not part of the function. Stone and wooden weapons were considered to be more powerful the better they were made and decorated. In some island groups weaving was a strong part of the culture and gifting woven articles was an ingrained practice. Dwellings were imbued with character by the skill of their building. Body decoration and jewelry is of an international standard to this day.\n\nThe religious attributes of Polynesians were common over the whole Pacific region. While there are some differences in their spoken languages they largely have the same explanation for the creation of the earth and sky, for the gods that rule aspects of life and for the religious practices of everyday life. People traveled thousands of miles to celebrations that they all owned communally.\n\nBeginning in the 1820s large numbers of missionaries worked in the islands, converting many groups to Christianity. Polynesia, argues Ian Breward,  is now \"one of the most strongly Christian regions in the world....Christianity was rapidly and successfully incorporated into Polynesian culture.  War and slavery disappeared.\"<ref>Ian Breward in {{cite book|last1=Farhadian|first1=Charles E.|last2=Hefner|first2=Robert W.|title=Introducing World Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6qjCRE85QjYC&pg=PA228|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|pages=218\u201329|isbn=9781405182485}}; quote at p 228</ref>\n\n==Languages==\n{{main|Polynesian languages}}\nPolynesian languages are all members of the family of [[Oceanic languages]], a sub-branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family. Polynesian languages show a considerable degree of similarity. The [[vowels]] are generally the same\u2014a, e, i, o, and u, pronounced as in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]]\u2014and the consonants are always followed by a vowel. The languages of various island groups show changes in [[consonant]]s. ''R'' and ''v'' are used in central and eastern Polynesia whereas ''l'' and ''v'' are used in western Polynesia. The [[glottal stop]] is increasingly represented by an inverted comma or [[\u2018okina]]. In the [[Society Islands]], the original [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] *''k'' and *''ng'' have merged as glottal stop; so the name for the ancestral homeland, deriving from Proto-Nuclear Polynesian ''*sawaiki'',<ref name=\"pollexSawaiki\">{{cite web|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/sawaiki/ |title=Polynesian Lexicon Project Online |publisher=Pollex.org.nz }}</ref> becomes Havai'i. In New Zealand, where the original *''w'' is used instead of ''v'', the ancient home is [[Hawaiki]]. In the Cook Islands, where the glottal stop replaces the original *''s'' (with a likely intermediate stage of *''h''), it is \u2018Avaiki. In the Hawaiian islands, where the glottal stop replaces the original ''k'', the largest island of the group is named Hawai\u2018i. In Samoa, where the original ''s'' is used instead of ''h'', ''v'' replaces ''w'', and the glottal stop replaces the original ''k'', the largest island is called [[Savai'i]].<ref name=trh>{{cite book\n|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucViki-t1-body-d1-d7.html\n|work=NZ Electronic Text Centre, Victoria University, NZ Licence CC-BY-SA 3.0\n|title=Vikings of the Sunrise\n|first=Te Rangi (Sir Peter Henry Buck)\n|last=Hiroa\n|page=67\n|year=1964|edition=reprint\n|publisher=Whitcombe and Tombs Ltd.\n|isbn=\n|accessdate=2 March 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nWith the exception of New Zealand, the majority of independent Polynesian islands derive much of their income from foreign aid and remittances from those who live in other countries. Some encourage their young people to go where they can earn good money to remit to their stay-at-home relatives. Many Polynesian locations, such as [[Easter Island]], supplement this with tourism income. Some have more unusual sources of income, such as [[Tuvalu]] which marketed its '[[.tv]]' internet top-level domain name or the Cooks that relied on [[postage stamp]] sales.\n\n[[File:Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi]], [[Prime Minister of Samoa]], who initiated the [[Polynesian Leaders Group]] in late 2011.]]\n\n==Inter-Polynesian cooperation==\nThe first major attempt at uniting the Polynesian islands was by [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in the 1930s, when various theorists (chiefly [[Hachir\u014d Arita]]) began promulgating the idea of what would soon become known as the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Under the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, all nations stretching from [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[Northeast Asia]] to [[Oceania]] would be united under one, large, cultural and economic bloc which would be free from [[Western imperialism]]. The policy theorists who conceived it, along with the Japanese public, largely saw it as a pan-Asian movement driven by ideals of freedom and independence from Western colonial oppression. In practice, however, it was frequently corrupted by militarists who saw it as an effective policy vehicle through which to strengthen Japan's position and advance its dominance within Asia. At its greatest extent, it stretched from [[Japanese coup d'\u00e9tat in French Indochina|Japanese occupied Indochina]] in the west to the [[Gilbert Islands]] in the east, although it was originally planned to stretch as far east as [[Hawai'i]] and [[Easter Island]] and as far west as [[India]]. This never came to fruition, however, as Japan was defeated during [[World War II]] and subsequently lost all power and influence it had.<ref>Tolland, John.

The area from the Hawaiian Islands in the north, to Easter Island in the east and to New Zealand in the south were all settled by Polynesians.\n\n[[Navigator]]s traveled to small inhabited islands using only their own senses and knowledge passed by [[oral tradition]] from navigator to apprentice. In order to locate directions at various times of day and year, navigators in Eastern Polynesia memorized important facts: the motion of specific [[star]]s, and where they would rise on the [[horizon]] of the ocean; [[weather]]; times of travel; wildlife species (which congregate at particular positions); directions of swells on the ocean, and how the crew would feel their motion; colors of the sea and sky, especially how clouds would cluster at the locations of some islands; and angles for approaching harbors.\n\n[[File:Priests traveling across kealakekua bay for first contact rituals.jpg|thumb|right|Polynesian (Hawaiian) navigators sailing multi-hulled [[canoe]], ca 1781]]\n[[File:Va'a canoe, Matavai village, Savaii, Samoa MS.JPG|thumb|right|A common fishing canoe ''va'a'' with outrigger in [[Savai'i]] island, [[Samoa]], 2009]]\nThese [[wayfinding]] techniques, along with [[outrigger]] [[canoe]] construction methods, were kept as [[guild]] secrets. Generally each island maintained a guild of navigators who had very high status; in times of famine or difficulty these navigators could trade for aid or evacuate people to neighboring islands. On his first voyage of Pacific exploration Cook had the services of a Polynesian navigator, [[Tupaia (navigator)|Tupaia]], who drew a hand-drawn chart of the islands within {{convert|2000|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} radius (to the north and west) of his home island of [[Ra'iatea]].

This left the problem of accounting for the presence of the Polynesians in such isolated and scattered parts of the Pacific. By the late 19th century to the early 20th century a more generous view of Polynesian navigation had come into favor, perhaps creating a romantic picture of their canoes, seamanship and navigational expertise.\n\nIn the mid to late 1960s, scholars began testing sailing and paddling experiments related to Polynesian navigation: [[David Henry Lewis|David Lewis]] sailed his catamaran from Tahiti to New Zealand using [[stellar navigation]] without instruments and [[Ben Finney]] built a 12-meter (40-foot) replica of a Hawaiian double canoe \"Nalehia\" and tested it in Hawaii.<ref>Lewis, David. [http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/?wid=4479 \"A Return Voyage Between Puluwat and Saipan Using Micronesian Navigational Techniques\"]. In Ben R. Finney (1976), ''Pacific Navigation and Voyaging'', The Polynesian Society Inc.</ref> Meanwhile, Micronesian ethnographic research in the Caroline Islands revealed that traditional stellar navigational methods were still in every day use. Recent re-creations of Polynesian voyaging have used methods based largely on Micronesian methods and the teachings of a Micronesian navigator, [[Mau Piailug]].\n\nIt is probable that the Polynesian navigators employed a whole range of techniques including use of the stars, the movement of ocean currents and wave patterns, the air and sea interference patterns caused by islands and [[atoll]]s, the flight of birds, the winds and the weather. Scientists think that long-distance Polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of [[bird migration|birds]]. There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds and some say that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with these [[flyway]]s. One theory is that they would have taken a [[frigatebird]] with them. These birds refuse to land on the water as their feathers will become waterlogged making it impossible to fly. When the voyagers thought they were close to land they may have released the bird, which would either fly towards land or else return to the canoe. It is likely that the Polynesians also used wave and swell formations to navigate. It is thought that the Polynesian navigators may have measured the time it took to sail between islands in \"canoe-days\u2019\u2019 or a similar type of expression.\n\nAlso, people of the Marshall Islands used special devices called [[Marshall Islands stick chart|stick charts]], showing the places and directions of swells and wave-breaks, with tiny seashells affixed to them to mark the positions of islands along the way. Materials for these maps were readily available on beaches, and their making was simple; however, their effective use needed years and years of study.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ethnomath.org/resources/bryan1938.pdf|title=Marshall Islands Stick Chart|last=Bryan|first=E.H.|year=1938|journal=Paradise of the Pacific|volume=50|pages=12\u201313|issue=7|access-date=2008-05-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604091519/http://www.ethnomath.org/resources/bryan1938.pdf|archive-date=2011-06-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n<!-- {{Wikipedia-Books}} -->\n<!-- {{main|Outline of Polynesia|Index of Polynesia-related articles}} -->\n<!-- * [[Bibliography of Polynesia]] -->\n* [[List of Polynesians]]\n* [[Polynesian mythology]]\n* [[Polynesian Society]]\n* [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]]\n* [[:Category:Films set in Polynesia|Films set in Polynesia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |author=William Ellis |title=Polynesian Researches, During a Residence of Nearly Six Years in the South Sea Islands, Volume 1 |year=1829 |publisher=Fisher, Son & Jackson |edition= |url= https://archive.org/details/polynesianresea10elligoog}}\n*{{cite book |author=William Ellis |title=Polynesian Researches, During a Residence of Nearly Six Years in the South Sea Islands, Volume 2 |year=1829 |publisher=Fisher, Son & Jackson |edition= |url= https://archive.org/details/polynesianresea12elligoog}}\n*{{cite book |author=William Ellis |title=Polynesian Researches, During a Residence of Nearly Six Years in the South Sea Islands, Volume 3 |year=1832 |publisher=Fisher, Son & Jackson |edition=Second |url= https://books.google.com/?id=aFFEAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR1}}\n* {{cite book | author=Gatty, Harold | title=Finding Your Ways Without Map or Compass | publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-486-40613-8}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons_and_category|Polynesia}}\n* [http://www.jeanhervedaude.com/Ile%20de%20Paques%20histoire%20par%20les%20timbres.htm History of Easter Island illustrated by stamps]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130501080025/http://www.abc.net.au/gnt/history/Transcripts/s1066068.htm Interview with David Lewis]\n* [http://www.tritonfilms.com/lewisreview.htm Lewis commenting on ''Spirits of the Voyage'']\n* [http://www.maori.info/ Useful introduction to Maori society, including canoe voyages]\n* [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/15/1037080913844.html Obituary: David Henry Lewis\u2014including how he came to rediscover Pacific Ocean navigation methods]\n\n{{Polynesia}}\n{{Countries and territories of Oceania}}\n{{Culture of Oceania|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Regions of the world}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Polynesia| ]]\n[[Category:Islands of Oceania]]\n[[Category:Regions of Oceania]]\n[[Category:18th-century neologisms]]\n[[Category:French words and phrases]]\n", "name_user": "The Frankenstrat", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added more specific info on the definition of Polynesia.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesia"}

''Toxorhynchites'' larvae live on a protein- and fat-rich diet of aquatic animals such as mosquito larvae. They have no need to risk their lives sucking blood in adulthood, having already accumulated the necessary materials for [[oogenesis]] and [[vitellogenesis]].\n\nMost species occur in [[forest]]s. The larvae of one [[jungle]] variety, ''[[Toxorhynchites splendens]]'', consume larvae of other mosquito species occurring in tree crevices, particularly ''[[Aedes aegypti]]''.\n\nUnlike ''Toxorhynchites'' mosquitoes, [[Detritivores|detritus feeder]] mosquito female larvae rely on blood meals to produce eggs more plentifully than a diet of nectar would permit. And even though blood sucking is a risky strategy that entails more casualties, and they could in principle subsist on nectar and the like as their males generally do, the risk is outweighed on average by the increase in the number and size of yolk-rich eggs that such protein-rich food permit.\n\n[[Environmental scientists]] have suggested that ''Toxorhynchites'' mosquitoes be [[introduced species|introduced]] to areas outside their natural range in order to fight [[dengue fever]].  This has been practiced historically, but errors have been made.

''Toxorhynchites'' larvae live on a protein- and fat-rich diet of aquatic animals such as mosquito larvae. They have no need to risk their lives sucking blood in adulthood, having already accumulated the necessary materials for [[oogenesis]] and [[vitellogenesis]].\n\nMost species occur in [[forest]]s. The larvae of one [[jungle]] variety, ''[[Toxorhynchites splendens]]'', consume larvae of other mosquito species occurring in tree crevices, particularly ''[[Aedes aegypti]]''.\n\nUnlike ''Toxorhynchites'' mosquitoes, [[Detritivores|detritus feeder]] mosquito female larvae rely on blood meals to produce eggs more plentifully than a diet of nectar would permit. And even though blood sucking is a risky strategy that entails more casualties, and they could in principle subsist on nectar and the like as their males generally do, the risk is outweighed on average by the increase in the number and size of yolk-rich eggs that such protein-rich food permit.\n\n[[Environmental scientists]] have suggested that ''Toxorhynchites'' mosquitoes be [[introduced species|introduced]] to areas outside their natural range in order to fight [[dengue fever]].

In the 1920s, the party emerged as the main rival to the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP), and the party's first prime minister, [[Ky\u00f6sti Kallio]], held the office four times between 1922 and 1937.  After [[World War II]], the party settled as one of the four major political parties in Finland, alongside the [[National Coalition Party]], the Social Democrats, and, until the 1980s, the Communist [[SKDL]]. [[Urho Kekkonen]] served as [[President of Finland]] from 1956 to 1982: by far the longest period of any president. The name 'Centre Party' was adopted in 1965, and 'Centre of Finland' in 1988. The Centre Party was the largest party in Parliament from 2003 to 2011, during which time [[Matti Vanhanen]] was prime minister for seven years. Following the [[2011 Finnish parliamentary election|2011 election]], the party was reduced in parliamentary representation from the largest party to the fourth largest, but in [[2015 Finnish parliamentary election|2015]] it reclaimed its status as the largest party. In [[2019 Finnish parliamentary election|2019]], it suffered a considerable defeat, losing 18 of 49 seats.\n\nAs a [[Nordic agrarian parties|Nordic agrarian party]], the Centre Party's political influence is greatest in small and rural municipalities, where it often holds a majority of the seats in the municipal councils. Decentralisation is the policy that is most characteristic of the Centre Party. The Centre has been the ruling party in Finland a number of times since [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finnish independence]]. 12 of the [[List of Prime Ministers of Finland|Prime Ministers of Finland]], three of the [[List of Presidents of Finland|Presidents]] and a former [[European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs]] have been from the party.  The Finnish Centre Party is the mother organisation of [[Finnish Centre Youth]], [[Finnish Centre Students]], and {{ill|Finnish Centre Women|fi|Suomen Keskustanaiset}}.\n\nIt is now one of the five largest political parties in the country, along with the National Coalition Party, the SDP, the [[Green League]] and the [[Finns Party]]. It has 31 seats in the [[Finnish Parliament]]. The Centre Party chairman is [[Katri Kulmuni]], who was elected in September 2019 to follow [[Juha Sipil\u00e4]], the former [[Prime Minister of Finland]].<ref name=kulmuni>{{cite news |last1=Virtanen |first1=Jarno |title=Keskustan uudeksi puheenjohtajaksi valittiin Katri Kulmuni |url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-10960622 |publisher=Yle Uutiset |accessdate=2019-09-07 |language=fi |date=2019-09-07}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Santeri Alkio3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Santeri Alkio, the ideological father of the Centre Party.]]\nThe party was founded in 1906 as a movement of citizens in the Finnish countryside. Before Finnish independence, political power in Finland was centralised in the capital and to the [[estates of the realm]]. The centralisation gave space for a new political movement. In 1906 two [[agrarianism|agrarian]] movements were founded. They merged in 1908 to become one political party known as the '''Agrarian League''' or '''Maalaisliitto'''. An older, related movement was the [[temperance movement in Finland|temperance movement]], which had overlapping membership and which gave future Agrarian League activists experience in working in an organisation.<ref>Mickelsson, Rauli. ''Suomen puolueet \u2013 historia, muutos ja nykyp\u00e4iv\u00e4.'' Vastapaino, 2007.</ref>\n\n===Santeri Alkio's ideology===\nSoon the ideas of humanity, education, the spirit of the land, peasant-like freedom, [[decentralisation]], \"the issue of poor people\", [[progressivism]],<ref name=\"hs.fi\">Mylly, Juhani.

[[Santeri Alkio]] was the most important ideological father of the party.\n\n=== Defending the republic ===\nAt the dawn of Finnish independence [[Conservatism|conservative]] social forces made an attempt to establish the [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|Kingdom of Finland]]. The Agrarian League opposed [[monarchism]] fiercely<ref name=\"hs.fi\"/> even though monarchists claimed that a new king from the [[German Empire]] and [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] would have safeguarded Finnish foreign relations. At this time, anti-[[anarchism|anarchist]] peasants threatened the existence of the party.<ref name=\"Vares113\">Vares 2006, p. 113.</ref><ref name=\"Vares108\">Vares 2006, p. 108</ref>\n\nBecause around 40 Social Democratic members of the Parliament had escaped to Russia after the [[Finnish Civil War]] and about 50 others had been arrested, the Agrarian League members of the Parliament became the only republicans in Parliament in 1918. Nevertheless, the news about the problems of the German Empire from [[Liberalism in Germany|German liberals]] encouraged the fight of Agrarian League in the Parliament.<ref name=\"Vares122-126\">Vares 2006, p. 122-126</ref>\n\nThe Agrarian League managed to maintain the republican voices in the Parliament until the fall of the German Empire, which ruined the dreams of the monarchists.<ref name=\"Vares288-289\">Vares 1998, p. 288-289</ref>\n\nThe relentless opposition to the monarchy was rewarded in the [[1919 Finnish parliamentary election|parliamentary election 1919]] and the party became the biggest non-[[socialism|socialist]] party in Finland with 19.7% of the votes.\n\n===Post-war period===\nAfter the 1919 election, the centrist and progressive forces, including the Agrarian League, were constant members in Finnish governments. Their moderate attitude in restless post-war Finland secured a steady growth in following elections. The Party formed many [[centrism|centrist]] minority governments with [[National Progressive Party (Finland)|National Progressive Party]] and got its first Prime Ministers [[Ky\u00f6sti Kallio]] 1922 and [[Juho Sunila]] 1927.\n\n===Conciliation between right and left===\nFor the Agrarian League, the centrist governments were just a transitional period towards an era, which would integrate the \"red\" and \"white\" sides of the Civil War into one nation. Nevertheless, not everyone was happy with the conciliatory politics of centrist governments. The extreme right [[Lapua Movement]] grew bigger and bigger in the Agrarian League strongholds in the countryside. Many party members joined the new radical movement. The Lapua Movement organised assaults and kidnappings in Finland between 1929 and 1932. In 1930, after the kidnapping of progressive president [[Kaarlo Juho St\u00e5hlberg]], the Agrarian League broke off all its ties to the movement and got a new political enemy in the countryside \u2013 The [[Patriotic People's Movement (Finland)|Patriotic People's Movement]] (IKL), which was founded after the Lapua Movement was outlawed.<ref>Siltala, Juha: Lapuan liike ja kyyditykset 1930, 1985, Otava</ref>\n\nIn the [[1933 Finnish parliamentary election|parliamentary election 1933]] the main campaign issues were the differing attitudes towards democracy and the rule of law between the Patriotic Electoral Alliance ([[National Coalition Party]] and Patriotic People's Movement) and the Legality Front ([[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]], Agrarian League, [[Swedish People's Party of Finland|Swedish People's Party]] and [[National Progressive Party (Finland)|Progressives]]). The Patriotic Electoral Alliance favoured continuing the search for suspected Communists \u2013 the Communist Party and its affiliated organisations in the spirit of the Lapua Movement. The Legality Front did not want to spend any significant time on searching suspected Communists but rather wanted to concentrate on keeping the far-right in check. The Legality Front won the elections, but the Agrarian League lost a part of its support.<ref>Seppo Zetterberg et al., eds., A Small Giant of the Finnish History / Suomen historian pikkuj\u00e4ttil\u00e4inen, Helsinki:  WSOY, 2003</ref><ref>Sakari Virkkunen, Finland's Presidents I / Suomen presidentit I, Helsinki:  WSOY, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Cooperation with the Social Democrats ===\n[[File:Kallio vierailulla sotasairaalassa.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Finland's president, centrist Ky\u00f6sti Kallio, on a visit to a military hospital Christmas 1939.]]\n\nBecause of fierce opposition of the president [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]] the Social Democrats remained outside the government and the Agrarian League was part of the [[centre-right]] governments until 1937. In 1937 [[1937 Finnish presidential election|Presidential election]] the Agrarian League candidate [[Ky\u00f6sti Kallio]] was elected president with the votes of centrist (Agrarian and Progressive) and social-democratic coalition which wanted to ensure that President Svinhufvud would not be re-elected. The new president allowed the first [[centre-left]] government to be formed in Finland. A new era had begun.\n\n===World War II===\nWith the outbreak of the Winter War, a government of national unity was formed. President Kallio died shortly after the war.\n\n===Kekkonen, the centrist statesman===\n[[File:Pieks\u00e4m\u00e4ki - Kekkos-graffiti IMG 0227 C.JPG|thumb|350px|left|Urho Kekkonen was the President of Finland from 1956 to 1982 and became a symbolic figure of a statesman in Finland.

Kekkonen continued the \"active neutrality\" policy of his predecessor [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|President Juho Kusti Paasikivi]], a doctrine which came to be known as the \u201c[[Paasikivi\u2013Kekkonen line]]\u201d. Under it, [[Finland]] retained its independence while being able to trade with [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] members and those of the [[Warsaw Pact]].\n\n===Pressure of populism===\n[[Veikko Vennamo]], a vocal Agrarian politician, ran into serious disagreement particularly with Arvo Korsimo, then Party Secretary of the Agrarian Union, and was excluded from the parliamentary group. As a result, Vennamo immediately started building his own organisation and founded a new party, the [[Finnish Rural Party]] (''Suomen maaseudun puolue'', SMP) in 1959. Vennamo was a [[populism|populist]] and became a critic of Kekkonen and [[political corruption]] within the \"old parties\", particularly the Centre Party. Although this party had some success, it was essentially tied to Veikko Vennamo's person. His son Pekka Vennamo was able to raise the party to new success and into government in 1983, but after this, the Rural Party's support declined steadily and eventually the party went bankrupt in 1995. Immediately after this, the [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] [[Finns Party]] (''Perussuomalaiset'') was founded by former members of SMP.\n\n===Transformation to Centre Party===\nIn 1965, the party changed its name to \"Centre Party\" or ''Keskustapuolue'' and in 1988 took its current name ''Suomen Keskusta'' (literally Centre of Finland). Despite urbanisation of Finland and a temporary nadir in support, the party managed to continue to attract voters.\n\nThe [[Liberal People's Party (Finland)|Liberal People's Party]] (LKP) became a 'member party' of the Centre Party in 1982.  The two separated again after the success of the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]] in [[Sweden]] [[1985 Swedish general election|in 1985]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Liberal Parties in Western Europe |author=David Arter |editor= Emil Joseph Kirchner |year=1988 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-32394-9 |pages=326\u2013327 |chapter=Liberal parties in Finland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IrE08SV1wEC }}</ref>\n\n===Division over EU membership===\n[[File:Olli Rehn by Moritz Kosinsky 2.jpg|thumb|[[Olli Rehn]], European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs 2010\u20132014.]]\nThe Centre Party was a key player in making the decision to apply for Finnish EU membership in 1992. As the leading governing party its support for the application was crucial. The party itself, both leadership and supporters, was far from united on the issue. In the parliament, 22 out of 55 Centre MPs voted against the application. In June 1994 the party congress decided to support EU membership (by 1607 votes to 834), but only after the prime minister and party chairman [[Esko Aho]] threatened to resign if the party were to oppose the membership.\n\nThe centrist tradition of defending equal political and economic rights for peripheral areas was reflected in the internal resistance that opposed chairman Aho's ambitions to lead Finland to the EU.<ref>Raunio, Tapio.

However, after regaining power in 2003, the party accepted the euro.\n\n===2012 and beyond===\nThe party congress in June 2012 elected the newcomer [[Juha Sipil\u00e4]] to replace Mari Kiviniemi as the party's chair. Sipil\u00e4 defeated young deputy chairman Tuomo Puumala and a well known veteran politician Paavo V\u00e4yrynen in the voting.\n\nThe previous chairman, Mari Kiviniemi, succeeded Matti Vanhanen as prime minister in 2010, serving in the office for one year. At the time she was the third Centre Party Prime Minister of Finland in succession. [[Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki]] preceded Vanhanen and she was the first woman as a prime minister of Finland. She did not seek another term as party chair.\n\nOlli Rehn, a member of the party, served in the [[European Commission]] for ten years between 2004 and 2014 and was the [[European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs]] in 2010\u20132014.\n\nThe Centre Party was the biggest loser of the [[2011 Finnish parliamentary election|2011 parliamentary election]], losing 16 seats and going from largest party to fourth place. The party's support was lower than in any parliamentary election since [[1917 Finnish parliamentary election|1917]]. However, the party won the [[2015 Finnish parliamentary election|2015 parliamentary elections]] and formed a coalition with the [[Finns Party]] and the [[National Coalition Party]].\n\nIn March 2016, the Centre Party announced that its candidate for the [[2018 Finnish presidential election|2018 presidential election]] will be the former Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, the first declared presidential candidate in the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/politiikka/a1458188578788?ref=hs-prio-4-3 |title=Vanhanen l\u00e4htee presidenttikisaan ja luopuu keskustan eduskuntaryhm\u00e4n johdosta |publisher=Helsingin sanomat |date=17 March 2016 |accessdate=18 March 2016 |language=Finnish}}</ref><ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/vanhanenpresidentiksi/ Matti Vanhanen presidentiksi] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160521074555/https://sites.google.com/site/vanhanenpresidentiksi/ |date=21 May 2016 }} (in Finnish).

Unlike many other large parties in Europe, its ideology is not primarily based on economic systems.

The party expressly rejects a [[federal Europe]]. The party was originally opposed to Finland's membership in the [[Euro]] currency, but later stated that it would not seek to withdraw from the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] once Finland had entered.\n\nIn Finland, there is no large party that supports [[liberalism]] ''per se''. Instead, liberalism is found in most major parties including the Centre Party, which supports decentralisation, free will, free and fair trade, and small enterprise. The Centre Party characteristically supports decentralisation, particularly decreasing the central power, increasing the power of municipalities and populating the country evenly.{{clarify|reason=What does it mean to populate the country evenly?|date=September 2018}} During the party's premierships 2003\u20132011, these policies were also manifested as transferrals of certain government agencies from the capital to smaller cities in the regions.\n\nThroughout the period of Finland's independence, the Centre Party has been the party most often represented in the government. The country's longest-serving president, [[Urho Kekkonen]], was a member of the party, as were two other presidents.\n\nToday, only a small portion of the votes given to the party come from farmers and the Centre Party draws support from a wide range of professions. However, even today rural Finland and small towns form the strongest base of support for the party, although it has strived for a breakthrough in the major southern cities as well. In the [[2011 Finnish parliamentary election|2011 parliamentary election]] the party received only 4.5 per cent of votes cast in the capital Helsinki, compared to 33.4 per cent in the largely rural electoral district of [[Oulu (electoral district)|Oulu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/vaalit/tulospalvelu/2011/index.html|title=Vaalit 2011|work=Yle Uutiset|accessdate=24 February 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507165011/http://yle.fi/vaalit/tulospalvelu/2011/index.html|archivedate=7 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\n\n===Party structure===\nIn the organisation of the Centre Party, local associations dominate the election of party leaders, the selection of local candidates and drafting of policy.

In the 1920s, the party emerged as the main rival to the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP), and the party's first prime minister, [[Ky\u00f6sti Kallio]], held the office four times between 1922 and 1937.  After [[World War II]], the party settled as one of the four major political parties in Finland, alongside the [[National Coalition Party]], the Social Democrats, and, until the 1980s, the Communist [[SKDL]]. [[Urho Kekkonen]] served as [[President of Finland]] from 1956 to 1982: by far the longest period of any president. The name 'Centre Party' was adopted in 1965, and 'Centre of Finland' in 1988. The Centre Party was the largest party in Parliament from 2003 to 2011, during which time [[Matti Vanhanen]] was prime minister for seven years. Following the [[2011 Finnish parliamentary election|2011 election]], the party was reduced in parliamentary representation from the largest party to the fourth largest, but in [[2015 Finnish parliamentary election|2015]] it reclaimed its status as the largest party. In [[2019 Finnish parliamentary election|2019]], it suffered a considerable defeat, losing 18 of 49 seats.\n\nAs a [[Nordic agrarian parties|Nordic agrarian party]], the Centre Party's political influence is greatest in small and rural municipalities, where it often holds a majority of the seats in the municipal councils. Decentralisation is the policy that is most characteristic of the Centre Party. The Centre has been the ruling party in Finland a number of times since [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finnish independence]]. 12 of the [[List of Prime Ministers of Finland|Prime Ministers of Finland]], three of the [[List of Presidents of Finland|Presidents]] and a former [[European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs]] have been from the party.  The Finnish Centre Party is the mother organisation of [[Finnish Centre Youth]], [[Finnish Centre Students]], and {{ill|Finnish Centre Women|fi|Suomen Keskustanaiset}}.\n\nIt is now one of the five largest political parties in the country, along with the National Coalition Party, the SDP, the [[Green League]] and the [[Finns Party]]. It has 31 seats in the [[Finnish Parliament]]. The Centre Party chairman is [[Katri Kulmuni]], who was elected in September 2019 to follow [[Juha Sipil\u00e4]], the former [[Prime Minister of Finland]].<ref name=kulmuni>{{cite news |last1=Virtanen |first1=Jarno |title=Keskustan uudeksi puheenjohtajaksi valittiin Katri Kulmuni |url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-10960622 |publisher=Yle Uutiset |accessdate=2019-09-07 |language=fi |date=2019-09-07}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Santeri Alkio3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Santeri Alkio, the ideological father of the Centre Party.]]\nThe party was founded in 1906 as a movement of citizens in the Finnish countryside. Before Finnish independence, political power in Finland was centralised in the capital and to the [[estates of the realm]]. The centralisation gave space for a new political movement. In 1906 two [[agrarianism|agrarian]] movements were founded. They merged in 1908 to become one political party known as the '''Agrarian League''' or '''Maalaisliitto'''. An older, related movement was the [[temperance movement in Finland|temperance movement]], which had overlapping membership and which gave future Agrarian League activists experience in working in an organisation.<ref>Mickelsson, Rauli. ''Suomen puolueet \u2013 historia, muutos ja nykyp\u00e4iv\u00e4.'' Vastapaino, 2007.</ref>\n\n===Santeri Alkio's ideology===\nSoon the ideas of humanity, education, the spirit of the land, peasant-like freedom, [[decentralisation]], \"the issue of poor people\", [[progressivism]],<ref name=\"hs.fi\">Mylly, Juhani. Maalaisliitto-Keskustan historia II. {{cite web |url=http://www.hs.fi/kirjat/artikkeli/Suomen+keskustanv%C3%A4kev%C3%A4+nuoruusMaalaisliiton+historian+toinen+osa+on+j%C3%A4rjest%C3%B6historian+eliitti%C3%A4/900525165 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720185354/http://www.hs.fi/kirjat/artikkeli/Suomen+keskustanv%C3%A4kev%C3%A4+nuoruusMaalaisliiton+historian+toinen+osa+on+j%C3%A4rjest%C3%B6historian+eliitti%C3%A4/900525165 |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and later the \"green wave\" became the main political phrases used to describe the ideology of the party. [[Santeri Alkio]] was the most important ideological father of the party.\n\n=== Defending the republic ===\nAt the dawn of Finnish independence [[Conservatism|conservative]] social forces made an attempt to establish the [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|Kingdom of Finland]]. The Agrarian League opposed [[monarchism]] fiercely<ref name=\"hs.fi\"/> even though monarchists claimed that a new king from the [[German Empire]] and [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] would have safeguarded Finnish foreign relations. At this time, anti-[[anarchism|anarchist]] peasants threatened the existence of the party.<ref name=\"Vares113\">Vares 2006, p. 113.</ref><ref name=\"Vares108\">Vares 2006, p. 108</ref>\n\nBecause around 40 Social Democratic members of the Parliament had escaped to Russia after the [[Finnish Civil War]] and about 50 others had been arrested, the Agrarian League members of the Parliament became the only republicans in Parliament in 1918. Nevertheless, the news about the problems of the German Empire from [[Liberalism in Germany|German liberals]] encouraged the fight of Agrarian League in the Parliament.<ref name=\"Vares122-126\">Vares 2006, p. 122-126</ref>\n\nThe Agrarian League managed to maintain the republican voices in the Parliament until the fall of the German Empire, which ruined the dreams of the monarchists.<ref name=\"Vares288-289\">Vares 1998, p. 288-289</ref>\n\nThe relentless opposition to the monarchy was rewarded in the [[1919 Finnish parliamentary election|parliamentary election 1919]] and the party became the biggest non-[[socialism|socialist]] party in Finland with 19.7% of the votes.\n\n===Post-war period===\nAfter the 1919 election, the centrist and progressive forces, including the Agrarian League, were constant members in Finnish governments. Their moderate attitude in restless post-war Finland secured a steady growth in following elections. The Party formed many [[centrism|centrist]] minority governments with [[National Progressive Party (Finland)|National Progressive Party]] and got its first Prime Ministers [[Ky\u00f6sti Kallio]] 1922 and [[Juho Sunila]] 1927.\n\n===Conciliation between right and left===\nFor the Agrarian League, the centrist governments were just a transitional period towards an era, which would integrate the \"red\" and \"white\" sides of the Civil War into one nation. Nevertheless, not everyone was happy with the conciliatory politics of centrist governments. The extreme right [[Lapua Movement]] grew bigger and bigger in the Agrarian League strongholds in the countryside. Many party members joined the new radical movement. The Lapua Movement organised assaults and kidnappings in Finland between 1929 and 1932. In 1930, after the kidnapping of progressive president [[Kaarlo Juho St\u00e5hlberg]], the Agrarian League broke off all its ties to the movement and got a new political enemy in the countryside \u2013 The [[Patriotic People's Movement (Finland)|Patriotic People's Movement]] (IKL), which was founded after the Lapua Movement was outlawed.<ref>Siltala, Juha: Lapuan liike ja kyyditykset 1930, 1985, Otava</ref>\n\nIn the [[1933 Finnish parliamentary election|parliamentary election 1933]] the main campaign issues were the differing attitudes towards democracy and the rule of law between the Patriotic Electoral Alliance ([[National Coalition Party]] and Patriotic People's Movement) and the Legality Front ([[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]], Agrarian League, [[Swedish People's Party of Finland|Swedish People's Party]] and [[National Progressive Party (Finland)|Progressives]]). The Patriotic Electoral Alliance favoured continuing the search for suspected Communists \u2013 the Communist Party and its affiliated organisations in the spirit of the Lapua Movement. The Legality Front did not want to spend any significant time on searching suspected Communists but rather wanted to concentrate on keeping the far-right in check. The Legality Front won the elections, but the Agrarian League lost a part of its support.<ref>Seppo Zetterberg et al., eds., A Small Giant of the Finnish History / Suomen historian pikkuj\u00e4ttil\u00e4inen, Helsinki:  WSOY, 2003</ref><ref>Sakari Virkkunen, Finland's Presidents I / Suomen presidentit I, Helsinki:  WSOY, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Cooperation with the Social Democrats ===\n[[File:Kallio vierailulla sotasairaalassa.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Finland's president, centrist Ky\u00f6sti Kallio, on a visit to a military hospital Christmas 1939.]]\n\nBecause of fierce opposition of the president [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]] the Social Democrats remained outside the government and the Agrarian League was part of the [[centre-right]] governments until 1937. In 1937 [[1937 Finnish presidential election|Presidential election]] the Agrarian League candidate [[Ky\u00f6sti Kallio]] was elected president with the votes of centrist (Agrarian and Progressive) and social-democratic coalition which wanted to ensure that President Svinhufvud would not be re-elected. The new president allowed the first [[centre-left]] government to be formed in Finland. A new era had begun.\n\n===World War II===\nWith the outbreak of the Winter War, a government of national unity was formed. President Kallio died shortly after the war.\n\n===Kekkonen, the centrist statesman===\n[[File:Pieks\u00e4m\u00e4ki - Kekkos-graffiti IMG 0227 C.JPG|thumb|350px|left|Urho Kekkonen was the President of Finland from 1956 to 1982 and became a symbolic figure of a statesman in Finland. [[Graffiti]] representing Kekkonen in [[Pieks\u00e4m\u00e4ki]], Finland.]]\nIn 1956, [[Urho Kekkonen]], the candidate of the Agrarian League, was elected [[President of Finland]], after serving as prime minister several times. Kekkonen remained president until 1982. Kekkonen continued the \"active neutrality\" policy of his predecessor [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|President Juho Kusti Paasikivi]], a doctrine which came to be known as the \u201c[[Paasikivi\u2013Kekkonen line]]\u201d. Under it, [[Finland]] retained its independence while being able to trade with [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] members and those of the [[Warsaw Pact]].\n\n===Pressure of populism===\n[[Veikko Vennamo]], a vocal Agrarian politician, ran into serious disagreement particularly with Arvo Korsimo, then Party Secretary of the Agrarian Union, and was excluded from the parliamentary group. As a result, Vennamo immediately started building his own organisation and founded a new party, the [[Finnish Rural Party]] (''Suomen maaseudun puolue'', SMP) in 1959. Vennamo was a [[populism|populist]] and became a critic of Kekkonen and [[political corruption]] within the \"old parties\", particularly the Centre Party. Although this party had some success, it was essentially tied to Veikko Vennamo's person. His son Pekka Vennamo was able to raise the party to new success and into government in 1983, but after this, the Rural Party's support declined steadily and eventually the party went bankrupt in 1995. Immediately after this, the [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] [[Finns Party]] (''Perussuomalaiset'') was founded by former members of SMP.\n\n===Transformation to Centre Party===\nIn 1965, the party changed its name to \"Centre Party\" or ''Keskustapuolue'' and in 1988 took its current name ''Suomen Keskusta'' (literally Centre of Finland). Despite urbanisation of Finland and a temporary nadir in support, the party managed to continue to attract voters.\n\nThe [[Liberal People's Party (Finland)|Liberal People's Party]] (LKP) became a 'member party' of the Centre Party in 1982.  The two separated again after the success of the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]] in [[Sweden]] [[1985 Swedish general election|in 1985]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Liberal Parties in Western Europe |author=David Arter |editor= Emil Joseph Kirchner |year=1988 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-32394-9 |pages=326\u2013327 |chapter=Liberal parties in Finland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IrE08SV1wEC }}</ref>\n\n===Division over EU membership===\n[[File:Olli Rehn by Moritz Kosinsky 2.jpg|thumb|[[Olli Rehn]], European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs 2010\u20132014.]]\nThe Centre Party was a key player in making the decision to apply for Finnish EU membership in 1992. As the leading governing party its support for the application was crucial. The party itself, both leadership and supporters, was far from united on the issue. In the parliament, 22 out of 55 Centre MPs voted against the application. In June 1994 the party congress decided to support EU membership (by 1607 votes to 834), but only after the prime minister and party chairman [[Esko Aho]] threatened to resign if the party were to oppose the membership.\n\nThe centrist tradition of defending equal political and economic rights for peripheral areas was reflected in the internal resistance that opposed chairman Aho's ambitions to lead Finland to the EU.<ref>Raunio, Tapio.

However, after regaining power in 2003, the party accepted the euro.\n\n===2012 and beyond===\nThe party congress in June 2012 elected the newcomer [[Juha Sipil\u00e4]] to replace Mari Kiviniemi as the party's chair. Sipil\u00e4 defeated young deputy chairman Tuomo Puumala and a well known veteran politician Paavo V\u00e4yrynen in the voting.\n\nThe previous chairman, Mari Kiviniemi, succeeded Matti Vanhanen as prime minister in 2010, serving in the office for one year. At the time she was the third Centre Party Prime Minister of Finland in succession. [[Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki]] preceded Vanhanen and she was the first woman as a prime minister of Finland. She did not seek another term as party chair.\n\nOlli Rehn, a member of the party, served in the [[European Commission]] for ten years between 2004 and 2014 and was the [[European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs]] in 2010\u20132014.\n\nThe Centre Party was the biggest loser of the [[2011 Finnish parliamentary election|2011 parliamentary election]], losing 16 seats and going from largest party to fourth place. The party's support was lower than in any parliamentary election since [[1917 Finnish parliamentary election|1917]]. However, the party won the [[2015 Finnish parliamentary election|2015 parliamentary elections]] and formed a coalition with the [[Finns Party]] and the [[National Coalition Party]].\n\nIn March 2016, the Centre Party announced that its candidate for the [[2018 Finnish presidential election|2018 presidential election]] will be the former Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, the first declared presidential candidate in the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/politiikka/a1458188578788?ref=hs-prio-4-3 |title=Vanhanen l\u00e4htee presidenttikisaan ja luopuu keskustan eduskuntaryhm\u00e4n johdosta |publisher=Helsingin sanomat |date=17 March 2016 |accessdate=18 March 2016 |language=Finnish}}</ref><ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/vanhanenpresidentiksi/ Matti Vanhanen presidentiksi] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160521074555/https://sites.google.com/site/vanhanenpresidentiksi/ |date=21 May 2016 }} (in Finnish).

The party expressly rejects a [[federal Europe]]. The party was originally opposed to Finland's membership in the [[Euro]] currency, but later stated that it would not seek to withdraw from the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] once Finland had entered.\n\nIn Finland, there is no large party that supports [[liberalism]] ''per se''. Instead, liberalism is found in most major parties including the Centre Party, which supports decentralisation, free will, free and fair trade, and small enterprise. The Centre Party characteristically supports decentralisation, particularly decreasing the central power, increasing the power of municipalities and populating the country evenly.{{clarify|reason=What does it mean to populate the country evenly?|date=September 2018}} During the party's premierships 2003\u20132011, these policies were also manifested as transferrals of certain government agencies from the capital to smaller cities in the regions.\n\nThroughout the period of Finland's independence, the Centre Party has been the party most often represented in the government. The country's longest-serving president, [[Urho Kekkonen]], was a member of the party, as were two other presidents.\n\nToday, only a small portion of the votes given to the party come from farmers and the Centre Party draws support from a wide range of professions. However, even today rural Finland and small towns form the strongest base of support for the party, although it has strived for a breakthrough in the major southern cities as well. In the [[2011 Finnish parliamentary election|2011 parliamentary election]] the party received only 4.5 per cent of votes cast in the capital Helsinki, compared to 33.4 per cent in the largely rural electoral district of [[Oulu (electoral district)|Oulu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/vaalit/tulospalvelu/2011/index.html|title=Vaalit 2011|work=Yle Uutiset|accessdate=24 February 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507165011/http://yle.fi/vaalit/tulospalvelu/2011/index.html|archivedate=7 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\n\n===Party structure===\nIn the organisation of the Centre Party, local associations dominate the election of party leaders, the selection of local candidates and drafting of policy.
