He first competed as \"Jack Dempsey\" (by his own recollection) in the fall of 1914, in [[Cripple Creek, Colorado]]. His brother, Bernie, who often fought under the pseudonym, \"Jack Dempsey\"\u2014this a common practice of the day, in fighters' admiration of [[middleweight]] boxer and former champion, [[Jack \"Nonpareil\" Dempsey]]\u2014had signed to fight veteran George Copelin. Upon learning Copelin had sparred with then current world heavyweight champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], and given Bernie Dempsey was nearing 40 years of age, he strategically decided to back out of the fight.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Toby|title=Kid Blackie|date=1987|publisher=Wayfinder Press|location=Ouray, CO|isbn=0-9608764-7-2|page=79|ref=harv}}</ref> He substituted his brother, still unknown in Eastern Colorado, as \"Jack Dempsey\". The fans at ringside immediately knew this was not the man they'd paid to see.\n\nThe promoter became violently angry and \"sailed into us, barehanded\", threatening to stop the fight.<ref name=\"Round by Round An Autobiography\"/> Copelin himself, who outweighed Dempsey by 20 lbs. (165 to 145) upon seeing Dempsey's small stature in the ring, warned the promoter, \"I might kill that skinny guy.\" The promoter reluctantly permitted the fight to commence, and in his first outing as \"Jack Dempsey\", the future champion downed Copelin six times in the first round and twice in the second.{{sfnp|Dempsey|Considine|Slocum|1960|p=49}} From there, it was a battle of attrition (\"Neither Bernie nor I had taken into consideration the high altitude at Cripple Creek.\"), until a last knockdown of Copelin in the seventh, moved the referee to make the then-unusual move of stopping the fight once Copelin regained his feet. According to Dempsey \"In those days they didn't stop mining-town fights as long as one guy could move.\"{{sfnp|Dempsey|Considine|Slocum|1960|p=50}} This trial by fire carried with it a $100 purse. The promoter, angered at the switch pulled by the brothers, had laid no promised side bets, \"...and even if I did, I wouldn't give you anything.\"{{sfnp|Smith|1987|p=82}}\n\nSuch lessons were hard, but fighting was something Jack Dempsey did well. Following the name change, Dempsey won six bouts in a row by [[knockout]] before losing on a disqualification in four rounds to Jack Downey. During this early part of his career, Dempsey campaigned in Utah, frequently entering fights in towns in the [[Wasatch range|Wasatch Mountain Range]] region.  He followed his loss against Downey with a knockout win and two draws versus Johnny Sudenberg in [[Nevada]]. Three more wins and a draw followed when he met Downey again, this time resulting in a four-round draw.  Following these wins, Dempsey racked up 10 more wins that included matches against Sudenberg and Downey, knocking out Downey in two rounds.  These wins were followed with three no-decision matches, although at this point in the history of boxing, the use of judges to score a fight was often forbidden, so if a fight went the distance, it was called a draw or a no decision, depending on the state or county where the fight was held.\n\nAfter the United States entered [[World War I]] in 1917, Dempsey worked in a shipyard and continued to box. Afterward, he was accused by some boxing fans of being a [[slacker#World wars|slacker]] for not enlisting. This remained a black mark on his reputation until 1920, when evidence produced showed he had attempted to enlist in the [[U.S. Army]], but had been classified 4-F.<ref group=upper-alpha>According to This Draft Card https://www.archives.gov/atlanta/wwi-draft/dempsey.html</ref> After the war, Dempsey spent two years in [[Salt Lake City]], \"bumming around\" as he called it, before returning to the ring.<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\">{{cite book |title=The 12 Greatest Rounds Of Boxing: The Untold Stories |first1=Ferdie |last1=Pacheco |date= 2005 |location=London|publisher=Robson, Trafalgar Square |page=208 |isbn=9781861058058}}</ref>\n\n===World heavyweight champion===\n[[File:Jack Dempsey, Harry Houdini and Benny Leonard2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Dempsey mock punching [[Harry Houdini]] (held back by [[Benny Leonard]])]]\nAmong his opponents as a rising contender were [[Fireman Jim Flynn]], the only boxer ever to beat Dempsey by a knockout when Dempsey lost to him in the first round (although some boxing historians believe the fight was a \"fix\"),<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://coxscorner.tripod.com/dempsey_dive.html |first1=Monte |last1=Cox |first2=Bob |last2=Soderman |title= Did Jack Dempsey Take a Dive? |publisher=Cox's Corner |accessdate= 16 July 2008}}</ref> and [[Gunboat Smith]], formerly a highly ranked contender who had beaten both World Champion [[Jess Willard]] and Hall of Famer [[Sam Langford]].

In the interview, Kearns claimed to have informed Dempsey  he had wagered his share of the purse favoring a Dempsey win with a first-round knockout.  Kearns further stated he had applied [[plaster of Paris]] to the wrappings on the fighter's hands.\n\nBoxing historian [[J. J. Johnston]] said, \"the films show Willard upon entering the ring walking over to Dempsey and examining his hands.\" That, along with an experiment conducted by a boxing magazine designed to re-enact the fight have been noted as proof that Kearns' story was false.<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>\n\n''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine founder and editor [[Nat Fleischer]] claimed to be present when Dempsey's hands were wrapped, stating, \"Jack Dempsey had no loaded gloves, and no plaster of Paris over his bandages. I watched the proceedings and the only person who had anything to do with the taping of Jack's hands was Deforest. Kearns had nothing to do with it, so his plaster of Paris story is simply not true.\"\n\nDeforest himself said that he regarded the stories of Dempsey's gloves being loaded as libel, calling them \"trash\", and said he did not apply any foreign substance to them, which I can verify since I watched the taping.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleischer |first1=Nat |authorlink=Nat Fleischer|title=50 Years At Ringside|location=New York |publisher=Fleet Publishing Corp |year=1958 |page=118}}</ref> [[Sports writer]] [[Red Smith (sportswriter)|Red Smith]], in Dempsey's obituary published by ''The New York Times''' was openly dismissive of the claim.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0624.html |date=June 1, 1983 |title=OBITUARY: Jack Dempsey, 87, is Dead; Boxing Champion of 1920s |first1=Red |last1=Smith |authorlink1=Red Smith (sportswriter) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother rumor is that Dempsey used a [[knuckleduster]] during the first round.  Some speculated that the object used was a [[rail spike]].<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\"/> In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on July 3, 1979, Joe Stone, an ex-referee and boxing writer, asserted that in a film taken of the fight an object on the canvas could be seen after the final knockdown. He further asserted that the object appears to be removed by someone from Dempsey's corner. In the same film, however, Dempsey can be seen at various times during the fight pushing and holding with Willard with the palm of the glove in question and holding on to the ropes with both hands, making it next to impossible that he had any foreign object embedded in his glove, and the 'object' resembles a cigar.<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>\n\nFurther controversy was fueled by the fact that Dempsey left the ring at the end of the first round, thinking the fight was over. This was seen as a violation of the rules, however Willard's corner did not ask for enforcement in order for the referee to disqualify Dempsey.<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\"/>\n\n===Title defenses===\n[[File:Jack Dempsey v Georges Carpentier cph.3b35134.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Dempsey and Carpentier in the arena before the fight]]\nFollowing his victory, Jack Dempsey traveled around the country, making publicity appearances with circuses, staging exhibitions, and appearing in a low-budget Hollywood movie. Dempsey did not defend his title until September 1920, with a fight against [[Billy Miske]] in [[Benton Harbor]], Michigan. Miske was knocked out in three rounds.\n\nDempsey's second title defense was in December 1920 against Bill Brennan at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]], [[New York City]].

The fight was an elimination bout for a title shot against Tunney. Sharkey was beating Dempsey until the end.  The fight ended controversially when Sharkey claimed Dempsey had been hitting him below the belt. When Sharkey turned to the referee to complain, he left himself unprotected. Dempsey crashed a left hook onto his foe's chin, and Sharkey was unable to beat the ten-count.\n\n===Tunney rematch: \"The Long Count\"===\n{{Main article|The Long Count Fight}}\nThe Dempsey-Tunney rematch took place in [[Chicago, Illinois]], on September 22, 1927 {{ndash}} one day less than a year after losing his title to Tunney. Generating more interest than the Carpentier and Firpo bouts, the fight brought in a record-setting $2 million gate. Reportedly, gangster [[Al Capone]] offered to fix the rematch in his favor, but the referee was changed to prevent that from happening.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Listed|first1=Not|title=1927 Dempsey loses on long count|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dempsey-loses-on-long-count|website=History.com|publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC|accessdate=16 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323214646/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dempsey-loses-on-long-count|archive-date=March 23, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Millions around the country listened to the match by radio while hundreds of reporters covered the event. Tunney was paid a record one million dollars for the rematch.  Today's equivalent in U.S currency would be approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1927|r=0}}}}.00.{{inflation-fn|US}}\n\nDempsey was losing the fight on points when in the seventh round he knocked Tunney down with a left hook to the chin then landed several more punches. A new rule instituted at the time of the fight mandated that when a fighter knocked down an opponent, he must immediately go to a neutral corner.  Dempsey, however, refused to immediately move to the neutral corner when instructed by the referee. The referee had to escort Dempsey to the neutral corner, which bought Tunney at least an extra five seconds to recover.  Even though the official timekeeper clocked 14 seconds Tunney was down, Tunney got up at the referee's count of 9.  Dempsey then attempted to finish Tunney off before the end of the round, but failed to do so.  Tunney dropped Dempsey for a count of one in round eight and won the final two rounds of the fight, retaining the title of World Heavyweight Champion on a unanimous decision. Ironically, the neutral corner rule was requested during negotiations by members of the Dempsey camp. Another discrepancy was, when Tunney knocked Dempsey down, the timekeeper started the count immediately, not waiting for Tunney to move to a neutral corner.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.genetunney.org/idol63.html |title=Jack Dempsey \u2013 The Idol of Fistiana |first= Nat |last= Fleischer |chapter= Ch. 63: Drama of the Long Count |accessdate= 30 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314164236/http://www.genetunney.org/idol63.html |archivedate= 14 March 2007 |publisher= C.

Following retirement, Dempsey became known as a philanthropist.  In June 1932, he sponsored the \"Ride of Champions\" bucking horse event at [[Reno, Nevada]] with the \"Dempsey Trophy\" going to legendary [[Bareback bronc and Saddle bronc riding|bronc rider]] [[Pete Knight (rodeo)|Pete Knight]]. In 1933, Dempsey was approached by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to portray a boxer in the film, ''[[The Prizefighter and the Lady]]'', directed by [[W. S. Van Dyke]] and co-starring [[Myrna Loy]].\n\nThe Riviera del Pacifico Cultural and Convention Center in [[Ensenada, Baja California]], Mexico,  built in 1930, was  a gambling casino supposedly financed by Al Capone and managed by Jack Dempsey. Its clientele included [[Myrna Loy]], [[Lana Turner]] and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]].\n\nIn 1935, Dempsey opened Jack Dempsey's Restaurant in [[New York City]] on Eighth Avenue and 50th Street, across from the third [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]].

He first competed as \"Jack Dempsey\" (by his own recollection) in the fall of 1914, in [[Cripple Creek, Colorado]]. His brother, Bernie, who often fought under the pseudonym, \"Jack Dempsey\"\u2014this a common practice of the day, in fighters' admiration of [[middleweight]] boxer and former champion, [[Jack \"Nonpareil\" Dempsey]]\u2014had signed to fight veteran George Copelin. Upon learning Copelin had sparred with then current world heavyweight champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], and given Bernie Dempsey was nearing 40 years of age, he strategically decided to back out of the fight.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Toby|title=Kid Blackie|date=1987|publisher=Wayfinder Press|location=Ouray, CO|isbn=0-9608764-7-2|page=79|ref=harv}}</ref> He substituted his brother, still unknown in Eastern Colorado, as \"Jack Dempsey\". The fans at ringside immediately knew this was not the man they'd paid to see.\n\nThe promoter became violently angry and \"sailed into us, barehanded\", threatening to stop the fight.<ref name=\"Round by Round An Autobiography\"/> Copelin himself, who outweighed Dempsey by 20 lbs. (165 to 145) upon seeing Dempsey's small stature in the ring, warned the promoter, \"I might kill that skinny guy.\" The promoter reluctantly permitted the fight to commence, and in his first outing as \"Jack Dempsey\", the future champion downed Copelin six times in the first round and twice in the second.{{sfnp|Dempsey|Considine|Slocum|1960|p=49}} From there, it was a battle of attrition (\"Neither Bernie nor I had taken into consideration the high altitude at Cripple Creek.\"), until a last knockdown of Copelin in the seventh, moved the referee to make the then-unusual move of stopping the fight once Copelin regained his feet. According to Dempsey \"In those days they didn't stop mining-town fights as long as one guy could move.\"{{sfnp|Dempsey|Considine|Slocum|1960|p=50}} This trial by fire carried with it a $100 purse. The promoter, angered at the switch pulled by the brothers, had laid no promised side bets, \"...and even if I did, I wouldn't give you anything.\"{{sfnp|Smith|1987|p=82}}\n\nSuch lessons were hard, but fighting was something Jack Dempsey did well. Following the name change, Dempsey won six bouts in a row by [[knockout]] before losing on a disqualification in four rounds to Jack Downey. During this early part of his career, Dempsey campaigned in Utah, frequently entering fights in towns in the [[Wasatch range|Wasatch Mountain Range]] region.  He followed his loss against Downey with a knockout win and two draws versus Johnny Sudenberg in [[Nevada]]. Three more wins and a draw followed when he met Downey again, this time resulting in a four-round draw.  Following these wins, Dempsey racked up 10 more wins that included matches against Sudenberg and Downey, knocking out Downey in two rounds.  These wins were followed with three no-decision matches, although at this point in the history of boxing, the use of judges to score a fight was often forbidden, so if a fight went the distance, it was called a draw or a no decision, depending on the state or county where the fight was held.\n\nAfter the United States entered [[World War I]] in 1917, Dempsey worked in a shipyard and continued to box. Afterward, he was accused by some boxing fans of being a [[slacker#World wars|slacker]] for not enlisting. This remained a black mark on his reputation until 1920, when evidence produced showed he had attempted to enlist in the [[U.S. Army]], but had been classified 4-F.<ref group=upper-alpha>According to This Draft Card https://www.archives.gov/atlanta/wwi-draft/dempsey.html</ref> After the war, Dempsey spent two years in [[Salt Lake City]], \"bumming around\" as he called it, before returning to the ring.<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\">{{cite book |title=The 12 Greatest Rounds Of Boxing: The Untold Stories |first1=Ferdie |last1=Pacheco |date= 2005 |location=London|publisher=Robson, Trafalgar Square |page=208 |isbn=9781861058058}}</ref>\n\n===World heavyweight champion===\n[[File:Jack Dempsey, Harry Houdini and Benny Leonard2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Dempsey mock punching [[Harry Houdini]] (held back by [[Benny Leonard]])]]\nAmong his opponents as a rising contender were [[Fireman Jim Flynn]], the only boxer ever to beat Dempsey by a knockout when Dempsey lost to him in the first round (although some boxing historians believe the fight was a \"fix\"),<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://coxscorner.tripod.com/dempsey_dive.html |first1=Monte |last1=Cox |first2=Bob |last2=Soderman |title= Did Jack Dempsey Take a Dive? |publisher=Cox's Corner |accessdate= 16 July 2008}}</ref> and [[Gunboat Smith]], formerly a highly ranked contender who had beaten both World Champion [[Jess Willard]] and Hall of Famer [[Sam Langford]].

In the interview, Kearns claimed to have informed Dempsey  he had wagered his share of the purse favoring a Dempsey win with a first-round knockout.  Kearns further stated he had applied [[plaster of Paris]] to the wrappings on the fighter's hands.\n\nBoxing historian [[J. J. Johnston]] said, \"the films show Willard upon entering the ring walking over to Dempsey and examining his hands.\" That, along with an experiment conducted by a boxing magazine designed to re-enact the fight have been noted as proof that Kearns' story was false.<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>\n\n''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine founder and editor [[Nat Fleischer]] claimed to be present when Dempsey's hands were wrapped, stating, \"Jack Dempsey had no loaded gloves, and no plaster of Paris over his bandages. I watched the proceedings and the only person who had anything to do with the taping of Jack's hands was Deforest. Kearns had nothing to do with it, so his plaster of Paris story is simply not true.\"\n\nDeforest himself said that he regarded the stories of Dempsey's gloves being loaded as libel, calling them \"trash\", and said he did not apply any foreign substance to them, which I can verify since I watched the taping.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleischer |first1=Nat |authorlink=Nat Fleischer|title=50 Years At Ringside|location=New York |publisher=Fleet Publishing Corp |year=1958 |page=118}}</ref> [[Sports writer]] [[Red Smith (sportswriter)|Red Smith]], in Dempsey's obituary published by ''The New York Times''' was openly dismissive of the claim.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0624.html |date=June 1, 1983 |title=OBITUARY: Jack Dempsey, 87, is Dead; Boxing Champion of 1920s |first1=Red |last1=Smith |authorlink1=Red Smith (sportswriter) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother rumor is that Dempsey used a [[knuckleduster]] during the first round.

He further asserted that the object appears to be removed by someone from Dempsey's corner. In the same film, however, Dempsey can be seen at various times during the fight pushing and holding with Willard with the palm of the glove in question and holding on to the ropes with both hands, making it next to impossible that he had any foreign object embedded in his glove, and the 'object' resembles a cigar.<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>\n\nFurther controversy was fueled by the fact that Dempsey left the ring at the end of the first round, thinking the fight was over. This was seen as a violation of the rules, however Willard's corner did not ask for enforcement in order for the referee to disqualify Dempsey.<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\"/>\n\n===Title defenses===\n[[File:Jack Dempsey v Georges Carpentier cph.3b35134.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Dempsey and Carpentier in the arena before the fight]]\nFollowing his victory, Jack Dempsey traveled around the country, making publicity appearances with circuses, staging exhibitions, and appearing in a low-budget Hollywood movie.

Generating more interest than the Carpentier and Firpo bouts, the fight brought in a record-setting $2 million gate.

A new rule instituted at the time of the fight mandated that when a fighter knocked down an opponent, he must immediately go to a neutral corner.  Dempsey, however, refused to immediately move to the neutral corner when instructed by the referee. The referee had to escort Dempsey to the neutral corner, which bought Tunney at least an extra five seconds to recover.  Even though the official timekeeper clocked 14 seconds Tunney was down, Tunney got up at the referee's count of 9.  Dempsey then attempted to finish Tunney off before the end of the round, but failed to do so.  Tunney dropped Dempsey for a count of one in round eight and won the final two rounds of the fight, retaining the title of World Heavyweight Champion on a unanimous decision. Ironically, the neutral corner rule was requested during negotiations by members of the Dempsey camp. Another discrepancy was, when Tunney knocked Dempsey down, the timekeeper started the count immediately, not waiting for Tunney to move to a neutral corner.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.genetunney.org/idol63.html |title=Jack Dempsey \u2013 The Idol of Fistiana |first= Nat |last= Fleischer |chapter= Ch. 63: Drama of the Long Count |accessdate= 30 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314164236/http://www.genetunney.org/idol63.html |archivedate= 14 March 2007 |publisher= C.

He played as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] in the 1970s and 1980s for [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Nottingham Forest]], [[Stade Brestois 29|Brest]], [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[C.S. Mar\u00edtimo|Mar\u00edtimo]] and [[Melbourne Croatia]]. Wallace played in three international matches for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in the late 1970s.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Career in Scotland===\n\nWallace started at Scottish Junior club [[Yoker Athletic]]. He then joined the senior ranks with [[Scottish Football League]] club [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]].\n\n===Coventry City===\nHe was purchased for \u00a370,000 by the then [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry]] manager [[Gordon Milne]] in 1976. Milne paired his small frame with his larger strike partner [[Mick Ferguson]]. He emerged from a car accident whilst at the club sporting a deep scar on the forehead. He also suffered a detached a retina whilst playing for Coventry at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich]]. Coventry finished 7th in the [[1977-78 Football League]], their second best ever placing after the team of 1969-70. Unlike in 1969-70 they missed out on a UEFA competition place. Wallace played that season alongside Ferguson, [[Tommy Hutchison]], [[Terry Yorath]], [[Graham Oakey]], [[Bobby MacDonald]] and [[Jim Blyth (footballer, born 1955)|Jim Blyth]]. Wallace scored 23 goals that season, his first of three in a row as Coventry's top scorer. He was later inducted in to the Coventry City Hall of Fame.\n\n===Nottingham Forest===\nHe was sold to then reigning European champions [[Nottingham Forest]] in July 1980 for \u00a31.25 million making him one of the world's most expensive players. His first game was their [[UEFA Super Cup]] defeat to Valencia that summer. Wallace went on to be Forest's top scorer for the first three of the four seasons he played there, scoring 13 goals in each season he top scored.\n\n===Later career===\nHe moved to French club [[Stade Brestois 29|Brest]] for a short spell in 1984. He returned to English football with [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] around New Year in season 1984/85.\n\nIn 1986 he joined Portuguese club [[C.S. Mar\u00edtimo|Mar\u00edtimo]].
