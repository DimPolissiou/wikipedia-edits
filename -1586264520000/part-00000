In Japan, during the [[Sengoku era]] from the fifteenth to 17th century, the great struggle for feudal supremacy was fought, in part, by coastal fleets of several hundred boats, including the [[atakebune]]. In Korea, in the early 15th century during the [[Joseon]] era, \"[[Turtle ship|Geobukseon]]\"(\uac70\ubd81\uc120), was developed. The \"turtle ship\", as it was called is recognized as the first armored ship in the world.[[File:Japanese-Tokugawa-Ship-Ataka-Maru.png|thumb|right|A Japanese [[atakebune]] from the 16th century]]\n\n==== European developments ====\n[[File:Nao Victoria.jpg|thumb|Replica of Magellan's ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]''. [[Ferdinand Magellan]] led the first expedition that [[circumnavigated]] the globe in 1519\u20131522.]]\nUntil the [[Renaissance]], navigational technology remained comparatively primitive.{{Compared to?|date=December 2019}} This absence of technology did not prevent some civilizations from becoming sea powers. Examples include the maritime republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Hanseatic League]], and the [[Byzantine navy]]. The [[Viking]]s used their [[knarr]]s to explore [[North America]], trade in the [[Baltic Sea]] and plunder many of the coastal regions of Western Europe.\n\nTowards the end of the 14th century, ships like the [[carrack]] began to develop towers on the bow and stern. These towers decreased the vessel's stability, and in the 15th century, the [[caravel]], designed by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], based on the Arabic ''qarib'' which could sail closer to the wind, became more widely used. The towers were gradually replaced by the [[forecastle]] and [[stern]]castle, as in the carrack [[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|''Santa Mar\u00eda'']] of [[Christopher Columbus]]. This increased [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] allowed another innovation: the [[Scupper|freeing port]], and the artillery associated with it.\n\nThe [[carrack]] and then the [[caravel]] were developed in [[Portugal]]. After Columbus, [[Age of Discovery|European exploration]] rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080505144147/http://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/ships/golden_age_of_shipping/golden_age_of_shipping/index.shtml The European Golden Age of Shipping]\".

Her sinking led to [[Changes in safety practices following the RMS Titanic disaster|tighter safety regulations]]]]\nParallel to the development of warships, ships in service of marine fishery and trade also developed in the period between antiquity and the Renaissance.\n\nMaritime trade was driven by the development of shipping companies with significant financial resources. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on an adjacent [[towpath]], contended with the [[railway]] up to and past the early days of the [[industrial revolution]]. Flat-bottomed and flexible [[scow]] boats also became widely used for transporting small cargoes. Mercantile trade went hand-in-hand with exploration, self-financed by the commercial benefits of exploration.\n\nDuring the first half of the 18th century, the [[French Navy]] began to develop a new type of vessel known as a [[ship of the line]], featuring seventy-four guns. This type of ship became the backbone of all European fighting fleets. These ships were {{convert|56|m|ft}} long and their construction required 2,800 oak trees and {{convert|40|km|mi}} of rope; they carried a crew of about 800 sailors and soldiers.\n\nDuring the 19th century the [[Royal Navy]] enforced a ban on the [[slave trade]], acted to suppress [[piracy]], and continued to map the world. A [[clipper]] was a very fast sailing ship of the 19th century. The [[clipper route]]s fell into commercial disuse with the introduction of [[steamboat|steam ships]] with better fuel efficiency, and the opening of the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal]]s.\n\nShip designs stayed fairly unchanged until the late 19th century. The industrial revolution, new mechanical methods of [[propulsion]], and the ability to construct ships from metal triggered an explosion in ship design. Factors including the quest for more efficient ships, the end of long running and wasteful maritime conflicts, and the increased financial capacity of industrial powers created an avalanche of more specialized boats and ships. Ships built for entirely new functions, such as firefighting, rescue, and research, also began to appear.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Colombo.Express.wmt.jpg|thumb|''[[Colombo Express]]'', one of the largest container ships in the world, owned and operated by [[Hapag-Lloyd]] of [[Germany]]]]\nIn 2007, the world's fleet included 34,882 commercial vessels with [[gross tonnage]] of more than 1,000 [[ton (volume)|tons]],<ref name=\"unctad0732\">UNCTAD 2007, p. 32.</ref> totaling 1.04&nbsp;billion tons.<ref name=\"unctad07x\">UNCTAD 2007, p. x.</ref>  These ships carried 7.4&nbsp;billion tons of cargo in 2006, a sum that grew by 8% over the previous year.<ref name=\"unctad07x\"/>  In terms of tonnage, 39% of these ships are [[tanker (ship)|tankers]], 26% are [[bulk carrier]]s, 17% [[container ship]]s and 15% were [[general cargo ship|other types]].<ref name=\"unctad07x\"/>\n\nIn 2002, there were 1,240 [[warship]]s operating in the world, not counting small vessels such as [[patrol boat]]s. <!--Adding total tonnage before this next sentence would make it clearer!-->The [[United States]] accounted for 3 million tons worth of these vessels, [[Russia]] 1.35 million tons, the [[United Kingdom]] 504,660 tons and [[China]] 402,830 tons.

The world's major powers have recently used their naval power in cases such as the [[United Kingdom]] in the [[Falkland Islands]] and the [[United States]] in [[Iraq]].\n\nThe size of the world's [[fishing fleet]] is more difficult to estimate.

Ships designed for those venues may be specially adapted to the widths and depths of specific waterways. Examples of freshwater waterways that are navigable in part by large vessels include the [[Danube]], [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], [[Rhine River|Rhine]], [[Yangtze]] and [[Amazon River|Amazon]] Rivers, and the [[Great Lakes]].\n\n====Great Lakes====\n[[Lake freighter]]s, also called lakers, are [[cargo]] vessels that ply the [[Great Lakes]]. The most well-known is {{SS|Edmund Fitzgerald}}, the latest major vessel to be wrecked on the Lakes. These vessels are traditionally called boats, not ships. Visiting ocean-going vessels are called \"salties.\" Because of their additional [[Beam (nautical)|beam]], very large salties are never seen inland of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]. Because the smallest of the [[Soo Locks]] is larger than any Seaway lock, salties that can pass through the Seaway may travel anywhere in the Great Lakes. Because of their deeper draft, salties may accept partial loads on the Great Lakes, \"topping off\" when they have exited the Seaway. Similarly, the largest lakers are confined to the Upper Lakes ([[Lake Superior|Superior]], [[Lake Michigan|Michigan]], [[Lake Huron|Huron]], [[Lake Erie|Erie]]) because they are too large to use the Seaway locks, beginning at the [[Welland Canal]] that bypasses the [[Niagara River]].\n\nSince the [[freshwater]] lakes are less corrosive to ships than the [[Seawater|salt water]] of the oceans, lakers tend to last much longer than ocean freighters.

Special-purpose vessels often have specialized crew if necessary, for example scientists aboard [[research vessel]]s.\n\nFishing boats are generally small, often little more than {{convert|30|m|ft|sp=us}} but up to {{convert|100|m|ft}} for a large tuna or [[whaling ship]]. Aboard a [[fish processing vessel]], the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, {{convert|85800000|t|LT ST|sigfig=3|lk=on}} of fish were caught in the marine capture fishery.<ref name=\"fao11\">UNFAO, 2007, p. 11.</ref> [[Anchoveta]] represented the largest single catch at {{convert|10700000|t|LT ST|sigfig=3}}.<ref name=\"fao11\" />  That year, the top ten marine capture species also included [[Alaska pollock]], [[Blue whiting]], [[Skipjack tuna]], [[Atlantic herring]], [[Chub mackerel]], [[Anchovy|Japanese anchovy]], [[Trachurus|Chilean jack mackerel]], [[Largehead hairtail]], and [[Yellowfin tuna]].<ref name=\"fao11\" />  Other species including [[salmon]], [[shrimp]], [[lobster]], [[clam]]s, [[squid]] and [[crab]], are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by [[Fishing net|nets]], such as [[Seine fishing|purse seine]], beach seine, lift nets, [[gillnet]]s, or entangling nets. Another is [[trawl]]ing, including [[Bottom trawling|bottom trawl]]. [[Fish hook|Hooks]] and lines are used in methods like [[long-line fishing]] and [[hand-line fishing]]. Another method is the use of [[fishing trap]].\n\nCargo ships transport dry and liquid cargo. Dry cargo can be transported in bulk by [[bulk carrier]]s, packed directly onto a [[general cargo ship]] in break-bulk, packed in [[intermodal container]]s as aboard a [[container ship]], or driven aboard as in [[roll-on roll-off ship]]s. Liquid cargo is generally carried in bulk aboard tankers, such as [[oil tanker]]s which may include both crude and finished products of oil, [[chemical tanker]]s which may also carry vegetable oils other than chemicals and [[LPG/LNG tanker]]s, although smaller shipments may be carried on container ships in [[tank container]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gubbins |first=Edmund J. |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z-1nHalOC2gC&pg=PA58&dq=Cargo+shipping+industry&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjemPXW_PbnAhWKmuAKHdOOAMYQ6AEwAXoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=Cargo%20shipping%20industry&f=false |title=The Shipping Industry: The Technology and Economics of Specialisation |year=1986 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-2-88124-063-8 |language=en }}</ref>\n\nPassenger ships range in size from small river ferries to very large [[cruise ship]]s. This type of vessel includes [[ferry|ferries]], which move passengers and vehicles on short trips; [[ocean liner]]s, which carry passengers from one place to another; and [[cruise ship]]s, which carry passengers on voyages undertaken for pleasure, visiting several places and with leisure activities on board, often returning them to the port of embarkation. [[Riverboat]]s and [[ferry boat|inland ferries]] are specially designed to carry passengers, cargo, or both in the challenging river environment. Rivers present special hazards to vessels. They usually have varying water flows that alternately lead to high speed water flows or protruding rock hazards. Changing siltation patterns may cause the sudden appearance of shoal waters, and often floating or sunken logs and trees (called snags) can endanger the hulls and propulsion of riverboats. Riverboats are generally of shallow draft, being broad of beam and rather square in plan, with a low freeboard and high topsides. Riverboats can survive with this type of configuration as they do not have to withstand the high winds or large waves that are seen on large lakes, seas, or oceans.\n\n[[File:Albatun Dod.jpg|thumb|''Albatun Dos'', a tuna boat at work near [[Victoria, Seychelles]]]]\n\n[[Fishing vessel]]s are a subset of commercial vessels, but generally small in size and often subject to different regulations and classification. They can be categorized by several criteria: architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, geographical origin, and technical features such as rigging. As of 2004, the world's fishing fleet consisted of some 4 million vessels.<ref name=\"fao25\">UNFAO, 2007, p. 25.</ref>  Of these, 1.3 million were decked vessels with enclosed areas and the rest were open vessels.<ref name=\"fao25\" />  Most decked vessels were mechanized, but two-thirds of the open vessels were traditional craft propelled by sails and oars.<ref name=\"fao25\" />  More than 60% of all existing large fishing vessels{{NoteTag|UNFAO defines a large fishing vessel as one with [[gross tonnage]] over 100 GT.}} were built in Japan, Peru, the Russian Federation, Spain or the United States of America.<ref name=\"fao28\">UNFAO, 2007, p. 28.</ref>\n\n===Special purpose vessels===\n{{Main|Weather ship}}\n[[File:Polarfront.jpg|thumb|The weather ship [[MS Polarfront|MS ''Polarfront'']] at sea.]]\nA [[weather ship]] was a ship stationed in the [[ocean]] as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in [[marine weather forecasting]].

Truman alongside USNS John Lenthall.jpg|thumb|American [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Harry S. Truman}} and a [[replenishment ship]]]]\nNaval vessels are those used by a [[navy]] for [[military]] purposes.\nThere have been many [[List of types of naval vessels|types of naval vessel]]. Modern naval vessels can be broken down into three categories: [[List of naval ship classes in service|surface warships]], [[List of submarine classes in service|submarines]], and [[auxiliary ship]]s.\n\nModern warships are generally divided into seven main categories: [[aircraft carrier]]s, [[cruiser]]s, [[destroyer]]s, [[frigate]]s, [[corvette]]s, [[submarine]]s and [[amphibious assault ship]]s. The distinction between cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and corvettes is not rigorous; the same vessel may be described differently in different navies. [[Battleship]]s were used during the [[Second World War]] and occasionally since then (the last battleships were removed from the [[U.S. Naval Vessel Register]] in March 2006), but were made obsolete by the use of [[carrier-borne aircraft]] and [[guided missile]]s.<ref name=\"usntypes\">With the addition of corvettes, this is the categorization used at {{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/our_ships.asp |title=U.S. Navy Ships |accessdate=2008-04-20 |author=United States Navy |authorlink=United States Navy |publisher=United States Navy }}</ref>\n\nMost military submarines are either [[attack submarine]]s or [[ballistic missile submarine]]s. Until the end of [[World War II]] the primary role of the diesel/electric submarine was anti-ship warfare, inserting and removing covert agents and military forces, and intelligence-gathering. With the development of the [[homing torpedo]], better [[sonar]] systems, and [[Nuclear navy|nuclear propulsion]], submarines also became able to effectively hunt each other. The development of [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|submarine-launched nuclear]] and [[cruise missiles]] gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from [[cluster munition]]s to [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\nMost [[Navy|navies]] also include many types of support and auxiliary vessel, such as [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], [[patrol boat]]s, [[OPV (naval)|offshore patrol vessels]], [[replenishment ship]]s, and [[hospital ship]]s which are designated [[healthcare|medical treatment]] facilities.<ref>[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=hospital%20ship Hospital Ship]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (definition via [[WordNet]], [[Princeton University]])</ref>\n\nFast combat vessels such as cruisers and destroyers usually have fine hulls to maximize speed and maneuverability.<ref name=\"cut224\">Cutler, 1999, p. 224.</ref>  They also usually have advanced [[marine electronics]] and communication systems, as well as weapons.\n\n==Architecture==\n{{Further|Naval architecture}}\nSome components exist in vessels of any size and purpose. Every vessel has a hull of sorts. Every vessel has some sort of propulsion, whether it's a pole, an ox, or a nuclear reactor. Most vessels have some sort of steering system. Other characteristics are common, but not as universal, such as compartments, holds, a superstructure, and equipment such as anchors and winches.\n\n===Hull===\n{{main|Hull (watercraft)}}\n[[File:CargoVslBadWeather.JPG|thumb|right|A ship's hull endures harsh conditions at sea, as illustrated by this [[reefer ship]] in bad weather.]]\nFor a ship to float, its weight must be less than that of the water displaced by the ship's hull.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boats \u2013 Why do they float?|url=http://www.ypte.org.uk/environmental/boats-why-do-they-float-/107|publisher=Environmental Involvement for Young People|accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref> There are many types of hulls, from logs lashed together to form a raft to the advanced hulls of [[America's Cup]] sailboats. A vessel may have a single hull (called a monohull design), two in the case of [[catamaran]]s, or three in the case of [[trimaran]]s. Vessels with more than three hulls are rare, but some experiments have been conducted with designs such as pentamarans. Multiple hulls are generally parallel to each other and connected by rigid arms.\n\nHulls have several elements. The [[bow (ship)|bow]] is the foremost part of the hull. Many ships feature a [[bulbous bow]]. The [[keel]] is at the very bottom of the hull, extending the entire length of the ship. The rear part of the hull is known as the [[stern]], and many hulls have a flat back known as a [[transom (nautical)|transom]]. Common hull appendages include [[propeller]]s for propulsion, [[rudder]]s for steering, and [[Stabilizer (ship)|stabilizers]] to quell a ship's rolling motion. Other hull features can be related to the vessel's work, such as fishing gear and [[sonar|sonar domes]].\n\nHulls are subject to various hydrostatic and hydrodynamic constraints. The key hydrostatic constraint is that it must be able to support the entire weight of the boat, and maintain stability even with often unevenly distributed weight. Hydrodynamic constraints include the ability to withstand shock waves, weather collisions and groundings.\n\nOlder ships and pleasure craft often have or had wooden hulls. Steel is used for most commercial vessels. Aluminium is frequently used for fast vessels, and [[composite material]]s are often found in sailboats and pleasure craft. Some ships have been made with [[Concrete ship|concrete hulls]].\n\n===Propulsion systems===\n{{Main|Marine propulsion}}\n[[File:Two Main Engines, V12.jpg|thumb|right|A ship's engine room]]\nPropulsion systems for ships fall into three categories: human propulsion, [[sailing]], and mechanical propulsion. Human propulsion includes [[Watercraft rowing|rowing]], which was used even on large [[galley]]s. Propulsion by sail generally consists of a sail hoisted on an erect mast, supported by stays and spars and controlled by ropes. Sail systems were the dominant form of propulsion until the 19th century. They are now generally used for recreation and competition, although experimental sail systems, such as the [[turbosail]]s, [[rotorsail]]s, and [[wingsail]]s have been used on larger modern vessels for fuel savings.\n\nMechanical [[propulsion systems]] generally consist of a motor or engine turning a [[propeller]], or less frequently, an [[impeller]] or [[Wave power ship|wave propulsion fins]]. [[Steam engine]]s were first used for this purpose, but have mostly been replaced by [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] or [[four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] diesel engines, outboard motors, and [[gas turbine engine]]s on faster ships. [[Nuclear marine propulsion|Nuclear reactors]] producing steam are used to propel [[warship]]s and [[icebreaker]]s, and there have been attempts to utilize them to power commercial vessels (see [[NS Savannah|NS ''Savannah'']]).\n\nIn addition to traditional fixed and controllable pitch propellers there are many specialized variations, such as contra-rotating and nozzle-style propellers. Most vessels have a single propeller, but some large vessels may have up to four propellers supplemented with [[bow thruster|transverse thrusters]] for maneuvring at ports. The propeller is connected to the main engine via a propeller shaft and, in case of medium- and high-speed engines, a reduction gearbox. Some modern vessels have a [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric powertrain]] in which the propeller is turned by an [[electric motor]] powered by the ship's generators.\n\n=== Steering systems ===\n[[File:Ferry-rudder-and-propeller.jpg|thumb|right|The rudder and propeller on a newly built [[Ferryboat|ferry]]]]\n\nFor ships with independent propulsion systems for each side, such as manual oars or some [[paddle steamer|paddles]],{{NoteTag|Almost all paddle steamers had a single engine with their paddles permanently coupled, without any clutches, and so could not be used for steering. Only a few examples with separate engines were steerable. The [[Royal Navy]] however operated diesel-electric harbour tugs with paddles into the 1970s, for their superior maneuverability.}} steering systems may not be necessary. In most designs, such as boats propelled by engines or sails, a steering system becomes necessary. The most common is a rudder, a submerged plane located at the rear of the hull. Rudders are rotated to generate a lateral force which turns the boat. Rudders can be rotated by a [[tiller]], manual wheels, or electro-hydraulic systems. [[Autopilot]] systems combine mechanical rudders with navigation systems. [[Ducted propeller]]s are sometimes used for steering.\n\nSome propulsion systems are inherently steering systems. Examples include the [[outboard motor]], the [[bow thruster]], and the [[Z-drive]].\n\n===Holds, compartments, and the superstructure===\nLarger boats and ships generally have multiple decks and compartments. Separate [[berthing]]s and [[Head (watercraft)|heads]] are found on sailboats over about {{convert|25|ft|m}}. Fishing boats and cargo ships typically have one or more cargo holds. Most larger vessels have an engine room, a [[galley (kitchen)|galley]], and various compartments for work. Tanks are used to store fuel, engine oil, and fresh water. Ballast tanks are equipped to change a ship's trim and modify its stability.\n\nSuperstructures are found above the main deck. On sailboats, these are usually very low. On modern cargo ships, they are almost always located near the ship's stern. On passenger ships and warships, the superstructure generally extends far forward.\n\n===Equipment===\nShipboard equipment varies from ship to ship depending on such factors as the ship's era, design, area of operation, and purpose. Some types of equipment that are widely found include:\n* [[Mast (sail)|Masts]] can be the home of antennas, navigation lights, radar transponders, fog signals, and similar devices often required by law.\n* [[Ground tackle]] includes equipment such as mooring winches, windlasses, and anchors. Anchors are used to [[mooring (watercraft)|moor]] ships in shallow water. They are connected to the ship by a rope or chain. On larger vessels, the chain runs through a [[hawsepipe]].\n* Cargo equipment such as [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[cargo boom]]s are used to load and unload cargo and ship's stores.\n* Safety equipment such as [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], [[liferaft]]s, and [[survival suit]]s are carried aboard many vessels for emergency use.\n\n==Design considerations==\n{{more citations needed section|date = February 2017}}\n\n===Hydrostatics===\n{{main|Fluid statics}}\nShips float in the water at a level where mass of the displaced water equals the mass of the vessel, such that the downwards force of [[gravity]] equals the upward force of [[buoyancy]]. As a vessel is lowered into the water its weight remains constant but the corresponding weight of water displaced by its hull increases. If the vessel's mass is evenly distributed throughout, it floats evenly along its length and across its [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width). A vessel's stability is considered in both this [[Initial stability|hydrostatic]] sense as well as a [[Ship stability|hydrodynamic]] sense, when subjected to movement, rolling and pitching, and the action of waves and wind. Stability problems can lead to excessive pitching and rolling, and eventually capsizing and sinking.{{citation needed|date = February 2017}}\n\n===Hydrodynamics===\n{{main|Fluid dynamics}}\n[[File:Bugwinkel39.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the {{ship|German battleship|Schlesien}}, showing a 39\u00b0 [[wake]], characteristic of vessels passing through water.]]\n[[File:Brosen shipsmovemensonthewave.svg|thumb|Vessels move along the three axes: 1.&nbsp;heave, 2.&nbsp;sway, 3.&nbsp;surge, 4.&nbsp;yaw, 5.&nbsp;pitch, 6.&nbsp;roll]]\nThe advance of a vessel through water is resisted by the water. This resistance can be broken down into several components, the main ones being the friction of the water on the hull and [[wave making resistance]]. To reduce resistance and therefore increase the speed for a given power, it is necessary to reduce the wetted surface and use submerged hull shapes that produce low amplitude waves. To do so, high-speed vessels are often more slender, with fewer or smaller appendages. The friction of the water is also reduced by regular maintenance of the hull to remove the sea creatures and algae that accumulate there. [[Antifouling]] paint is commonly used to assist in this. Advanced designs such as the [[bulbous bow]] assist in decreasing wave resistance.\n\nA simple way of considering wave-making resistance is to look at the hull in relation to its wake. At speeds lower than the wave propagation speed, the wave rapidly dissipates to the sides. As the hull approaches the wave propagation speed, however, the wake at the bow begins to build up faster than it can dissipate, and so it grows in [[amplitude]]. Since the water is not able to \"get out of the way of the hull fast enough\", the hull, in essence, has to climb over or push through the bow wave. This results in an [[exponential function|exponential]] increase in resistance with increasing speed.\n\nThis [[hull speed]] is found by the formula:\n\n{{block indent|<math>\\mbox{knots} \\approx 1.34 \\times \\sqrt{L \\mbox{ft}}</math>}}\n\nor, in [[metric system|metric]] units:\n\n{{block indent|<math>\\mbox{knots} \\approx 2.5 \\times \\sqrt{L \\mbox{m}}</math>}}\n\nwhere ''L'' is the length of the waterline in feet or meters.\n\nWhen the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 0.94, it starts to outrun most of its [[bow wave]], and the hull actually settles slightly in the water as it is now only supported by two wave peaks. As the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 1.34, the hull speed, the wavelength is now longer than the hull, and the stern is no longer supported by the wake, causing the stern to squat, and the bow rise. The hull is now starting to climb its own bow wave, and resistance begins to increase at a very high rate. While it is possible to drive a displacement hull faster than a speed/length ratio of 1.34, it is prohibitively expensive to do so. Most large vessels operate at speed/length ratios well below that level, at speed/length ratios of under 1.0.\n\nFor large projects with adequate funding, hydrodynamic resistance can be tested experimentally in a hull testing pool or using tools of [[computational fluid dynamics]].\n\nVessels are also subject to [[ocean surface wave]]s and [[sea swell]] as well as effects of [[wind]] and [[weather]]. These movements can be stressful for passengers and equipment, and must be controlled if possible. The rolling movement can be controlled, to an extent, by ballasting or by devices such as [[Stabilizer (ship)|fin stabilizers]]. Pitching movement is more difficult to limit and can be dangerous if the bow submerges in the waves, a phenomenon called pounding. Sometimes, ships must change course or speed to stop violent rolling or pitching.\n\nHow it has been convincingly shown in scientific studies of the 21st century,<ref name=\"a-Feigin-2001ru\">{{cite journal|last1=Feigin |first1=M I |script-title=ru:\u041f\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u0444\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0431\u0438\u0444\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b |trans-title=Manifestation of the bifurcation memory effect in behaviour of dynamic system |url=http://journal.issep.rssi.ru/ |journal=Soros Educational Journal |type=journal |year=2001 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=121\u201327 |language=ru|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130004824/http://journal.issep.rssi.ru/ |archivedate=November 30, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"a-Feigin-2004\">{{cite journal |last1 = Feigin |first1 = M|last2 = Kagan |first2 = M |title = Emergencies as a manifestation of effect of bifurcation memory in controlled unstable systems|journal = International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos |type = journal |year = 2004 |volume = 14 |issue = 7 |pages = 2439\u201347 |doi = 10.1142/S0218127404010746 |issn = 0218-1274}}</ref> controllability of some vessels decreases dramatically in some cases that are conditioned by effects of the [[bifurcation memory]].

The first is usually an initial contract to build the ship, the details of which can vary widely based on relationships between the [[shipowner]]s, operators, [[naval architect|designers]] and the [[shipyard]]. Then, the design phase carried out by a naval architect. Then the ship is constructed in a shipyard. After construction, the vessel is launched and goes into service. Ships end their careers in a number of ways, ranging from [[shipwreck]]s to service as a [[museum ship]] to [[Ship breaking|the scrapyard]].\n\n===Design===\n{{See also|Naval architecture}}\nA vessel's design starts with a specification, which a [[naval architect]] uses to create a project outline, assess required dimensions, and create a basic layout of spaces and a rough displacement. After this initial rough draft, the architect can create an initial hull design, a general profile and an initial overview of the ship's propulsion. At this stage, the designer can iterate on the ship's design, adding detail and refining the design at each stage.\n\nThe designer will typically produce an overall plan, a general specification describing the peculiarities of the vessel, and construction blueprints to be used at the building site. Designs for larger or more complex vessels may also include sail plans, electrical schematics, and plumbing and ventilation plans.\n\nAs environmental laws are becoming more strict, ship designers need to create their design in such a way that the ship, when it nears its end-of-term, can be [[Ship breaking|disassembled]] or [[Ship disposal|disposed]] easily and that waste is reduced to a minimum.\n\n===Construction===\n{{Main|Shipbuilding}}\n[[File:Brosen northern side lauching2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Ship naming and launching|ship launching]] at the Northern Shipyard in [[Gdansk, Poland]]]]\nShip construction takes place in a [[shipyard]], and can last from a few months for a unit produced in series, to several years to reconstruct a wooden boat like the frigate ''Hermione'', to more than 10&nbsp;years for an aircraft carrier. During [[World War II]], the need for cargo ships was so urgent that construction time for [[Liberty ship|Liberty Ships]] went from initially eight months or longer, down to weeks or even days. Builders employed production line and prefabrication techniques such as those used in shipyards today.<ref>Sawyer, L.A. and Mitchell, W.H.

The hull of a mass-produced fiberglass sailboat is constructed from a mold, while the steel hull of a cargo ship is made from large sections welded together as they are built.\n\nGenerally, construction starts with the hull, and on vessels over about {{convert|30|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, by the laying of the keel. This is done in a [[drydock]] or on land. Once the hull is assembled and painted, it is launched. The last stages, such as raising the superstructure and adding equipment and accommodation, can be done after the vessel is afloat.\n\nOnce completed, the vessel is delivered to the customer. [[Ship naming and launching|Ship launching]] is often a ceremony of some significance, and is usually when the vessel is formally named. A typical small rowboat can cost under US$100, $1,000 for a small speedboat, tens of thousands of dollars for a cruising sailboat, and about $2,000,000 for a [[Vend\u00e9e Globe]] class sailboat. A {{convert|25|m|ft|sp=us}} trawler may cost $2.5&nbsp;million, and a 1,000-person-capacity high-speed passenger ferry can cost in the neighborhood of $50&nbsp;million. A ship's cost partly depends on its complexity: a small, [[general cargo ship]] will cost $20&nbsp;million, a [[Panamax]]-sized [[bulk carrier]] around $35&nbsp;million, a [[supertanker]] around $105&nbsp;million and a large [[LNG carrier]] nearly $200&nbsp;million. The most expensive ships generally are so because of the cost of embedded electronics: a {{sclass-|Seawolf|submarine}} costs around $2&nbsp;billion, and an aircraft carrier goes for about $3.5&nbsp;billion.\n\n===Repair and conversion===\n[[File:Able-seaman-scaling-winch.JPG|thumb|[[Able seaman]] using a [[needlegun scaler]] on a mooring winch.]]\nShips undergo nearly constant maintenance during their career, whether they be underway, pierside, or in some cases, in periods of reduced operating status between charters or shipping seasons.\n\nMost ships, however, require trips to special facilities such as a [[drydock]] at regular intervals. Tasks often done at drydock include removing biological growths on the hull, [[sandblasting]] and repainting the hull, and replacing [[sacrificial anode]]s used to protect submerged equipment from corrosion. Major repairs to the propulsion and steering systems as well as major electrical systems are also often performed at dry dock.\n\nSome vessels that sustain major damage at sea may be repaired at a facility equipped for major repairs, such as a shipyard. Ships may also be converted for a new purpose: [[oil tanker]]s are often converted into [[floating production storage and offloading unit]]s.\n\n===End of service===\n{{Main|Ship disposal}}\n[[File:Jafrabad Chittagong shipbreaking (8).JPG|thumb|Workers drag steel plate ashore from beached ships in [[Chittagong]], Bangladesh]]\n\nMost ocean-going cargo ships have a life expectancy of between 20 and 30&nbsp;years. A sailboat made of plywood or fiberglass can last between 30 and 40&nbsp;years. Solid wooden ships can last much longer but require regular maintenance. Carefully maintained steel-hulled yachts can have a lifespan of over 100&nbsp;years.\n\nAs ships age, forces such as corrosion, osmosis, and rotting compromise hull strength, and a vessel becomes too dangerous to sail. At this point, it can be [[scuttling|scuttled]] at sea or [[Ship breaking|scrapped]] by [[ship breaking|shipbreakers]]. Ships can also be used as [[museum ships]], or expended to construct [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] or [[artificial reef]]s.\n\nMany ships do not make it to the scrapyard, and are lost in fires, collisions, [[ship grounding|grounding]], or sinking at sea. The Allies lost some 5,150 ships during [[World War II]].<ref>''Sea Lanes in Wartime \u2013 The American Experience 1775\u20131945'', 2nd edition, by Albion, Robert Greenhalgh and Pope, Jennie Barnes, Archon Books, 1968.</ref>\n\n== Measuring ships ==\n{{more citations needed section|date = February 2017}}\nOne can [[Molded depth|measure ships]] in terms of [[overall length]], [[length between perpendiculars]], [[Waterline length|length of the ship at the waterline]], [[Beam (nautical)|beam (breadth)]], depth (distance between the crown of the weather deck and the top of the keelson), [[Draft (hull)|draft]] (distance between the highest waterline and the bottom of the ship) and [[tonnage]]. A number of different tonnage definitions exist and are used when describing merchant ships for the purpose of tolls, taxation, etc.\n\nIn Britain until [[Samuel Plimsoll]]'s [[Merchant Shipping Act of 1876]], ship-owners could load their vessels until their decks were almost awash, resulting in a dangerously unstable condition. Anyone who signed on to such a ship for a voyage and, upon realizing the danger, chose to leave the ship, could end up in [[jail]]. Plimsoll, a [[Member of Parliament]], realised the problem and engaged some [[engineer]]s to derive a fairly simple [[formula]] to determine the position of a line on the side of any specific ship's hull which, when it reached the surface of the water during loading of cargo, meant the ship had reached its maximum safe loading level. To this day, that mark, called the \"[[waterline|Plimsoll Line]]\", exists on ships' sides, and consists of a [[circle]] with a horizontal line through the centre. On the Great Lakes of North America the circle is replaced with a diamond. Because different types of water (summer, fresh, tropical fresh, winter north Atlantic) have different densities, subsequent regulations required painting a group of lines forward of the Plimsoll mark to indicate the safe depth (or freeboard above the surface) to which a specific ship could load in water of various densities. Hence the \"ladder\" of lines seen forward of the Plimsoll mark to this day. This is called the \"[[freeboard mark]]\" or \"[[waterline#Standard load line marks|load line mark]]\" in the [[marine industry]].\n\n==Ship pollution==\nShip pollution is the pollution of air and water by [[shipping]]. It is a problem that has been accelerating as trade has become increasingly globalized, posing an increasing threat to the world's oceans and waterways as [[globalization]] continues. It is expected that \"shipping traffic to and from the United States is projected to double by 2020.\"<ref name=\"Watson\">Watson, T. (2004, August 30). Ship pollution clouds USA's skies. ''USA Today''. Retrieved November 1, 2006, from [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-08-30-ship-pollution_x.htm USAtoday.com]</ref> Because of increased traffic in ocean [[port]]s, pollution from ships also directly affects coastal areas. The pollution produced affects [[biodiversity]], climate, food, and human health. However, the degree to which humans are polluting and how it affects the world is highly debated and has been a hot international topic for the past 30&nbsp;years.\n\n===Oil spills===\n{{Main|Oil spill}}\n[[File:OilCleanupAfterValdezSpill.jpg|thumb|right| The tanker [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' spilled]] {{convert|10800000|USgal|impgal L|sigfig=4}} of oil into Alaska's [[Prince William Sound]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions about the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill |url=http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/History/FAQ.htm |publisher=State of Alaska |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925163639/http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/History/FAQ.htm |archivedate=2006-09-25}}</ref>]]\nOil spills have devastating effects on the environment. Crude oil contains [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) which are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the [[sediment]] and marine environment.<ref name = \"Panetta\"/> Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.\n\nBy the sheer amount of oil carried, modern oil tankers must be considered something of a threat to the environment. An oil tanker can carry {{convert|2|Moilbbl|m3|sigfig=4}} of crude oil, or {{convert|84000000|USgal|impgal L|sigfig=4}}<!-- See [[Talk:ship#conversions]] -->. This is more than six times the amount spilled in the widely known [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' incident]]. In this spill, the ship ran aground and dumped {{convert|10800000|USgal|impgal L|sigfig=4}} of oil into the ocean in March 1989. Despite efforts of scientists, managers, and volunteers, over 400,000 [[seabirds]], about 1,000 [[sea otters]], and immense numbers of fish were killed.<ref name=\"Panetta\"/>\n\nThe International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation has researched 9,351 accidental spills since 1974.<ref name=\"itopf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.itopf.com/information-services/data-and-statistics/statistics/ |title=International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Statistics |publisher=Itopf.com |date=2005-06-09 |accessdate=2009-04-21}}</ref> According to this study, most spills result from routine operations such as loading cargo, discharging cargo, and taking on fuel oil.<ref name=\"itopf\"/>  91% of the operational oil spills were small, resulting in less than 7&nbsp;tons per spill.<ref name=\"itopf\"/> Spills resulting from accidents like collisions, groundings, hull failures, and explosions are much larger, with 84% of these involving losses of over 700&nbsp;tons.<ref name=\"itopf\"/>\n\nFollowing the ''Exxon Valdez'' spill, the United States passed the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990]] (OPA-90), which included a stipulation that all tankers entering its waters be [[Double-hulled tanker|double-hulled]] by 2015. Following the sinkings of ''[[Erika (tanker)|Erika]]'' (1999) and ''[[Prestige oil spill|Prestige]]'' (2002), the [[European Union]] passed its own stringent anti-pollution packages (known as Erika I, II, and III), which require all tankers entering its waters to be double-hulled by 2010. The Erika packages are controversial because they introduced the new legal concept of \"serious negligence\".<ref>{{cite book |author=European Parliament |authorlink=European Parliament |title=Directive 2005/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements|year=2005 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:255:0011:01:EN:HTML |accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Ballast water===\n{{Main|Ballast water discharge and the environment}}\n[[File:Ship pumping ballast water.jpg|thumb|upright|A cargo ship pumps ballast water over the side]]\nWhen a large vessel such as a [[container ship]] or an oil tanker unloads cargo, seawater is pumped into other compartments in the hull to help stabilize and balance the ship.

''[[Mnemiopsis leidyi]]'', a species of comb jellyfish that inhabits estuaries from the United States to the Vald\u00e9s peninsula in [[Argentina]] along the [[Atlantic]] coast, has caused notable damage in the [[Black Sea]]. It was first introduced in 1982, and thought to have been transported to the Black Sea in a ship's ballast water. The population of the jellyfish shot up exponentially and, by 1988, it was wreaking havoc upon the local [[fishing]] industry. \"The [[anchovy]] catch fell from {{convert|204000|t|ST LT|sigfig=3|lk=on}} in 1984 to {{convert|200|t|ST LT|sigfig=3}} in 1993; sprat from {{convert|24600|t|ST LT|sigfig=3}} in 1984 to {{convert|12000|t|ST LT|sigfig=3}} in 1993; [[horse mackerel (disambiguation)|horse mackerel]] from {{convert|4000|t|ST LT|sigfig=3}} in 1984 to zero in 1993.\"<ref name=\"Meinesz\"/> Now that the jellyfish have exhausted the [[zooplankton]], including fish larvae, their numbers have fallen dramatically, yet they continue to maintain a stranglehold on the [[ecosystem]].

Most ships have a lifespan of a few decades before there is so much wear that refitting and repair becomes uneconomical. Ship breaking allows materials from the ship, especially steel, to be reused.\n\n[[File:Shipbreakingbangladesh2.jpg|thumb|Ship breaking near [[Chittagong]], [[Bangladesh]]]]\nIn addition to steel and other useful materials, however, ships (particularly older vessels) can contain many substances that are banned or considered dangerous in [[developed countries]]. [[Asbestos]] and [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) are typical examples. Asbestos was used heavily in ship construction until it was finally banned in most of the developed world in the mid 1980s. Currently, the costs associated with removing asbestos, along with the potentially expensive insurance and health risks, have meant that ship-breaking in most developed countries is no longer economically viable. Removing the metal for scrap can potentially cost more than the scrap value of the metal itself. In most of the developing world, however, shipyards can operate without the risk of [[Personal injury|personal injury lawsuits]] or [[Workers' compensation|workers' health claims]], meaning many of these shipyards may operate with high health risks. Furthermore, workers are paid very low rates with no overtime or other allowances. Protective equipment is sometimes absent or inadequate. Dangerous vapors and fumes from burning materials can be inhaled, and dusty asbestos-laden areas around such breakdown locations are commonplace.\n\nAside from the health of the yard workers, in recent years, ship breaking has also become an issue of major [[environmentalism|environmental concern]]. Many developing nations, in which ship breaking yards are located, have lax or no [[environmental law]], enabling large quantities of highly toxic materials to escape into the environment and causing serious health problems among ship breakers, the local population and wildlife. Environmental campaign groups such as [[Greenpeace]] have made the issue a high priority for their campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/ |title=Shipbreaking |publisher=Greenpeace |date=March 16, 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021012054547/http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/ |archivedate=October 12, 2002}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Transport}}<br>\n\n\n\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Admiralty law]]\n* [[Airship]]\n* [[Auxiliary ship]]\n* [[Boat]]\n* [[Chartering (shipping)]]\n* [[Dynamic positioning]]\n* [[Environmental impact of shipping]]\n* [[Factory ship]]\n* [[Ferry]]\n* [[Flag state]]\n* [[Fluyt]]\n* [[Galleon]]\n* [[Galley]]\n* [[Glossary of nautical terms]]\n* [[Marine electronics]]\n* [[Marine fuel management]]\n* [[Maritime history]]\n* [[Mother ship]]\n* [[Naval architecture]]\n* [[Naval ship]]\n* [[Navy]]\n* [[Nuclear marine propulsion]]\n* [[Propulsion]]\n* [[Sailing]]\n* [[Sailing ship]]\n* [[Sailor]]\n* [[Ship burial]]\n* [[Ship transport]]\n* [[Shipwreck]]\n* [[Spacecraft|Spaceship]]\n* [[Train ferry]]\n* [[Vessel safety survey]]\n* [[Warship]]\n* [[Watercraft]]\n* [[Whaler]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Model ships'''\n* [[Ship model]]\n* [[Ship model basin]]\n* [[Ship replica]]\n\n'''Lists'''\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[List of fictional ships]]\n* [[List of historical ship types]]\n* [[List of Panamax ports]]\n* [[List of largest cruise ships]]\n* [[List of world's largest ships by gross tonnage]]\n* [[List of world's longest ships]]\n* [[Lists of ships]]\n* [[Lists of shipwrecks]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Ship sizes'''\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Aframax]]\n* [[Capesize]]\n* [[Chinamax]]\n* [[Handymax]]\n* [[Handysize]]\n* [[Maersk Triple E class]]\n* [[Malaccamax]]\n* [[Panamax]]\n* [[Q-Max]]\n* [[Seawaymax]]\n* [[Suezmax]]\n* [[Oil tanker|Ultra Large Crude Carrier]]\n* [[Valemax]]\n* [[Oil tanker|VLCC]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n  | first = Steven\n  | last = Anzovin\n  | title = Famous First Facts (International Edition)\n  | publisher = H.W.

Historically, a [[Full-rigged ship|\"ship\"]] was a [[sailing ship|sailing vessel]] with at least three [[square rig|square-rigged]] [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and a full [[bowsprit]]. Ships are generally distinguished from [[boat]]s, based on size, shape, load capacity, and tradition.\n\nShips have been important contributors to human migration and commerce. They have supported the spread of [[colonization]] and the [[slave trade]], but have also served scientific, cultural, and humanitarian needs.

In Japan, during the [[Sengoku era]] from the fifteenth to 17th century, the great struggle for feudal supremacy was fought, in part, by coastal fleets of several hundred boats, including the [[atakebune]]. In Korea, in the early 15th century during the [[Joseon]] era, \"[[Turtle ship|Geobukseon]]\"(\uac70\ubd81\uc120), was developed.

[[Ferdinand Magellan]] led the first expedition that [[circumnavigated]] the globe in 1519\u20131522.]]\nUntil the [[Renaissance]], navigational technology remained comparatively primitive.{{Compared to?|date=December 2019}} This absence of technology did not prevent some civilizations from becoming sea powers. Examples include the maritime republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Hanseatic League]], and the [[Byzantine navy]]. The [[Viking]]s used their [[knarr]]s to explore [[North America]], trade in the [[Baltic Sea]] and plunder many of the coastal regions of Western Europe.\n\nTowards the end of the 14th century, ships like the [[carrack]] began to develop towers on the bow and stern. These towers decreased the vessel's stability, and in the 15th century, the [[caravel]], designed by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], based on the Arabic ''qarib'' which could sail closer to the wind, became more widely used. The towers were gradually replaced by the [[forecastle]] and [[stern]]castle, as in the carrack [[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|''Santa Mar\u00eda'']] of [[Christopher Columbus]]. This increased [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] allowed another innovation: the [[Scupper|freeing port]], and the artillery associated with it.\n\nThe [[carrack]] and then the [[caravel]] were developed in [[Portugal]]. After Columbus, [[Age of Discovery|European exploration]] rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080505144147/http://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/ships/golden_age_of_shipping/golden_age_of_shipping/index.shtml The European Golden Age of Shipping]\".

Her sinking led to [[Changes in safety practices following the RMS Titanic disaster|tighter safety regulations]]]]\nParallel to the development of warships, ships in service of marine fishery and trade also developed in the period between antiquity and the Renaissance.\n\nMaritime trade was driven by the development of shipping companies with significant financial resources. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on an adjacent [[towpath]], contended with the [[railway]] up to and past the early days of the [[industrial revolution]]. Flat-bottomed and flexible [[scow]] boats also became widely used for transporting small cargoes. Mercantile trade went hand-in-hand with exploration, self-financed by the commercial benefits of exploration.\n\nDuring the first half of the 18th century, the [[French Navy]] began to develop a new type of vessel known as a [[ship of the line]], featuring seventy-four guns. This type of ship became the backbone of all European fighting fleets. These ships were {{convert|56|m|ft}} long and their construction required 2,800 oak trees and {{convert|40|km|mi}} of rope; they carried a crew of about 800 sailors and soldiers.\n\nDuring the 19th century the [[Royal Navy]] enforced a ban on the [[slave trade]], acted to suppress [[piracy]], and continued to map the world. A [[clipper]] was a very fast sailing ship of the 19th century. The [[clipper route]]s fell into commercial disuse with the introduction of [[steamboat|steam ships]] with better fuel efficiency, and the opening of the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal]]s.\n\nShip designs stayed fairly unchanged until the late 19th century. The industrial revolution, new mechanical methods of [[propulsion]], and the ability to construct ships from metal triggered an explosion in ship design. Factors including the quest for more efficient ships, the end of long running and wasteful maritime conflicts, and the increased financial capacity of industrial powers created an avalanche of more specialized boats and ships. Ships built for entirely new functions, such as firefighting, rescue, and research, also began to appear.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Colombo.Express.wmt.jpg|thumb|''[[Colombo Express]]'', one of the largest container ships in the world, owned and operated by [[Hapag-Lloyd]] of [[Germany]]]]\nIn 2007, the world's fleet included 34,882 commercial vessels with [[gross tonnage]] of more than 1,000 [[ton (volume)|tons]],<ref name=\"unctad0732\">UNCTAD 2007, p. 32.</ref> totaling 1.04&nbsp;billion tons.<ref name=\"unctad07x\">UNCTAD 2007, p. x.</ref>  These ships carried 7.4&nbsp;billion tons of cargo in 2006, a sum that grew by 8% over the previous year.<ref name=\"unctad07x\"/>  In terms of tonnage, 39% of these ships are [[tanker (ship)|tankers]], 26% are [[bulk carrier]]s, 17% [[container ship]]s and 15% were [[general cargo ship|other types]].<ref name=\"unctad07x\"/>\n\nIn 2002, there were 1,240 [[warship]]s operating in the world, not counting small vessels such as [[patrol boat]]s. <!--Adding total tonnage before this next sentence would make it clearer!-->The [[United States]] accounted for 3 million tons worth of these vessels, [[Russia]] 1.35 million tons, the [[United Kingdom]] 504,660 tons and [[China]] 402,830 tons. The 20th century saw many naval engagements during the two [[world war]]s, the [[Cold War]], and the rise to power of naval forces of the two blocs. The world's major powers have recently used their naval power in cases such as the [[United Kingdom]] in the [[Falkland Islands]] and the [[United States]] in [[Iraq]].\n\nThe size of the world's [[fishing fleet]] is more difficult to estimate. The largest of these are counted as commercial vessels, but the smallest are legion. [[Fishing vessel]]s can be found in most seaside villages in the world.

Ships designed for those venues may be specially adapted to the widths and depths of specific waterways. Examples of freshwater waterways that are navigable in part by large vessels include the [[Danube]], [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], [[Rhine River|Rhine]], [[Yangtze]] and [[Amazon River|Amazon]] Rivers, and the [[Great Lakes]].\n\n====Great Lakes====\n[[Lake freighter]]s, also called lakers, are [[cargo]] vessels that ply the [[Great Lakes]]. The most well-known is {{SS|Edmund Fitzgerald}}, the latest major vessel to be wrecked on the Lakes. These vessels are traditionally called boats, not ships. Visiting ocean-going vessels are called \"salties.\" Because of their additional [[Beam (nautical)|beam]], very large salties are never seen inland of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]. Because the smallest of the [[Soo Locks]] is larger than any Seaway lock, salties that can pass through the Seaway may travel anywhere in the Great Lakes. Because of their deeper draft, salties may accept partial loads on the Great Lakes, \"topping off\" when they have exited the Seaway. Similarly, the largest lakers are confined to the Upper Lakes ([[Lake Superior|Superior]], [[Lake Michigan|Michigan]], [[Lake Huron|Huron]], [[Lake Erie|Erie]]) because they are too large to use the Seaway locks, beginning at the [[Welland Canal]] that bypasses the [[Niagara River]].\n\nSince the [[freshwater]] lakes are less corrosive to ships than the [[Seawater|salt water]] of the oceans, lakers tend to last much longer than ocean freighters. Lakers older than 50&nbsp;years are not unusual, and as of 2005, all were over 20&nbsp;years of age.<ref name=\"oecd2\">Office of Data and Economic Analysis, 2006, p. 2.</ref>\n\n{{SS|St. Marys Challenger}}, built in 1906 as ''William P Snyder'', was the oldest laker still working on the Lakes until its conversion into a barge starting in 2013. Similarly, ''E.M. Ford'', built in 1898 as ''Presque Isle'', was sailing the lakes 98&nbsp;years later in 1996. As of 2007 ''E.M. Ford'' was still afloat as a stationary transfer vessel at a riverside cement silo in [[Saginaw, Michigan]].\n\n=== Merchant ship ===\n{{Main|Merchant ship}}\n\n[[File:Container ships President Truman (IMO 8616283) and President Kennedy (IMO 8616295) at San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Two modern [[container ship]]s in [[San Francisco]]]]\n\n[[Merchant ship]]s are ships used for commercial purposes and can be divided into four broad categories: fishing, [[cargo ship]]s, [[passenger ship]]s, and special-purpose ships.<ref name=\"unctadxii\">UNCTAD 2007, p.&nbsp;xii uses a similar, but slightly more detailed classification system.</ref> The [[UNCTAD review of maritime transport]] categorizes ships as: oil tankers, bulk (and combination) carriers, general cargo ships, container ships, and \"other ships\", which includes \"liquefied petroleum gas carriers, liquefied natural gas carriers, parcel (chemical) tankers, specialized tankers, reefers, offshore supply, tugs, dredgers, cruise, ferries, other non-cargo\".

The fastest vessels may use [[pump-jet engine]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Most commercial vessels have full hull-forms to maximize cargo capacity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  Hulls are usually made of steel, although aluminum can be used on faster craft, and fiberglass on the smallest service vessels.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  Commercial vessels generally have a crew headed by a [[sea captain]], with [[deck officer]]s and [[engine officer]]s on larger vessels. Special-purpose vessels often have specialized crew if necessary, for example scientists aboard [[research vessel]]s.\n\nFishing boats are generally small, often little more than {{convert|30|m|ft|sp=us}} but up to {{convert|100|m|ft}} for a large tuna or [[whaling ship]]. Aboard a [[fish processing vessel]], the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, {{convert|85800000|t|LT ST|sigfig=3|lk=on}} of fish were caught in the marine capture fishery.<ref name=\"fao11\">UNFAO, 2007, p. 11.</ref> [[Anchoveta]] represented the largest single catch at {{convert|10700000|t|LT ST|sigfig=3}}.<ref name=\"fao11\" />  That year, the top ten marine capture species also included [[Alaska pollock]], [[Blue whiting]], [[Skipjack tuna]], [[Atlantic herring]], [[Chub mackerel]], [[Anchovy|Japanese anchovy]], [[Trachurus|Chilean jack mackerel]], [[Largehead hairtail]], and [[Yellowfin tuna]].<ref name=\"fao11\" />  Other species including [[salmon]], [[shrimp]], [[lobster]], [[clam]]s, [[squid]] and [[crab]], are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by [[Fishing net|nets]], such as [[Seine fishing|purse seine]], beach seine, lift nets, [[gillnet]]s, or entangling nets. Another is [[trawl]]ing, including [[Bottom trawling|bottom trawl]]. [[Fish hook|Hooks]] and lines are used in methods like [[long-line fishing]] and [[hand-line fishing]]. Another method is the use of [[fishing trap]].\n\nCargo ships transport dry and liquid cargo. Dry cargo can be transported in bulk by [[bulk carrier]]s, packed directly onto a [[general cargo ship]] in break-bulk, packed in [[intermodal container]]s as aboard a [[container ship]], or driven aboard as in [[roll-on roll-off ship]]s. Liquid cargo is generally carried in bulk aboard tankers, such as [[oil tanker]]s which may include both crude and finished products of oil, [[chemical tanker]]s which may also carry vegetable oils other than chemicals and [[LPG/LNG tanker]]s, although smaller shipments may be carried on container ships in [[tank container]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gubbins |first=Edmund J. |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z-1nHalOC2gC&pg=PA58&dq=Cargo+shipping+industry&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjemPXW_PbnAhWKmuAKHdOOAMYQ6AEwAXoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=Cargo%20shipping%20industry&f=false |title=The Shipping Industry: The Technology and Economics of Specialisation |year=1986 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-2-88124-063-8 |language=en }}</ref>\n\nPassenger ships range in size from small river ferries to very large [[cruise ship]]s. This type of vessel includes [[ferry|ferries]], which move passengers and vehicles on short trips; [[ocean liner]]s, which carry passengers from one place to another; and [[cruise ship]]s, which carry passengers on voyages undertaken for pleasure, visiting several places and with leisure activities on board, often returning them to the port of embarkation. [[Riverboat]]s and [[ferry boat|inland ferries]] are specially designed to carry passengers, cargo, or both in the challenging river environment. Rivers present special hazards to vessels. They usually have varying water flows that alternately lead to high speed water flows or protruding rock hazards. Changing siltation patterns may cause the sudden appearance of shoal waters, and often floating or sunken logs and trees (called snags) can endanger the hulls and propulsion of riverboats. Riverboats are generally of shallow draft, being broad of beam and rather square in plan, with a low freeboard and high topsides. Riverboats can survive with this type of configuration as they do not have to withstand the high winds or large waves that are seen on large lakes, seas, or oceans.\n\n[[File:Albatun Dod.jpg|thumb|''Albatun Dos'', a tuna boat at work near [[Victoria, Seychelles]]]]\n\n[[Fishing vessel]]s are a subset of commercial vessels, but generally small in size and often subject to different regulations and classification. They can be categorized by several criteria: architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, geographical origin, and technical features such as rigging. As of 2004, the world's fishing fleet consisted of some 4 million vessels.<ref name=\"fao25\">UNFAO, 2007, p. 25.</ref>  Of these, 1.3 million were decked vessels with enclosed areas and the rest were open vessels.<ref name=\"fao25\" />  Most decked vessels were mechanized, but two-thirds of the open vessels were traditional craft propelled by sails and oars.<ref name=\"fao25\" />  More than 60% of all existing large fishing vessels{{NoteTag|UNFAO defines a large fishing vessel as one with [[gross tonnage]] over 100 GT.}} were built in Japan, Peru, the Russian Federation, Spain or the United States of America.<ref name=\"fao28\">UNFAO, 2007, p. 28.</ref>\n\n===Special purpose vessels===\n{{Main|Weather ship}}\n[[File:Polarfront.jpg|thumb|The weather ship [[MS Polarfront|MS ''Polarfront'']] at sea.]]\nA [[weather ship]] was a ship stationed in the [[ocean]] as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in [[marine weather forecasting]].

[[Battleship]]s were used during the [[Second World War]] and occasionally since then (the last battleships were removed from the [[U.S. Naval Vessel Register]] in March 2006), but were made obsolete by the use of [[carrier-borne aircraft]] and [[guided missile]]s.<ref name=\"usntypes\">With the addition of corvettes, this is the categorization used at {{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/our_ships.asp |title=U.S. Navy Ships |accessdate=2008-04-20 |author=United States Navy |authorlink=United States Navy |publisher=United States Navy }}</ref>\n\nMost military submarines are either [[attack submarine]]s or [[ballistic missile submarine]]s. Until the end of [[World War II]] the primary role of the diesel/electric submarine was anti-ship warfare, inserting and removing covert agents and military forces, and intelligence-gathering. With the development of the [[homing torpedo]], better [[sonar]] systems, and [[Nuclear navy|nuclear propulsion]], submarines also became able to effectively hunt each other. The development of [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|submarine-launched nuclear]] and [[cruise missiles]] gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from [[cluster munition]]s to [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\nMost [[Navy|navies]] also include many types of support and auxiliary vessel, such as [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], [[patrol boat]]s, [[OPV (naval)|offshore patrol vessels]], [[replenishment ship]]s, and [[hospital ship]]s which are designated [[healthcare|medical treatment]] facilities.<ref>[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=hospital%20ship Hospital Ship]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (definition via [[WordNet]], [[Princeton University]])</ref>\n\nFast combat vessels such as cruisers and destroyers usually have fine hulls to maximize speed and maneuverability.<ref name=\"cut224\">Cutler, 1999, p. 224.</ref>  They also usually have advanced [[marine electronics]] and communication systems, as well as weapons.\n\n==Architecture==\n{{Further|Naval architecture}}\nSome components exist in vessels of any size and purpose. Every vessel has a hull of sorts. Every vessel has some sort of propulsion, whether it's a pole, an ox, or a nuclear reactor. Most vessels have some sort of steering system. Other characteristics are common, but not as universal, such as compartments, holds, a superstructure, and equipment such as anchors and winches.\n\n===Hull===\n{{main|Hull (watercraft)}}\n[[File:CargoVslBadWeather.JPG|thumb|right|A ship's hull endures harsh conditions at sea, as illustrated by this [[reefer ship]] in bad weather.]]\nFor a ship to float, its weight must be less than that of the water displaced by the ship's hull.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boats \u2013 Why do they float?|url=http://www.ypte.org.uk/environmental/boats-why-do-they-float-/107|publisher=Environmental Involvement for Young People|accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref> There are many types of hulls, from logs lashed together to form a raft to the advanced hulls of [[America's Cup]] sailboats. A vessel may have a single hull (called a monohull design), two in the case of [[catamaran]]s, or three in the case of [[trimaran]]s. Vessels with more than three hulls are rare, but some experiments have been conducted with designs such as pentamarans. Multiple hulls are generally parallel to each other and connected by rigid arms.\n\nHulls have several elements. The [[bow (ship)|bow]] is the foremost part of the hull. Many ships feature a [[bulbous bow]]. The [[keel]] is at the very bottom of the hull, extending the entire length of the ship. The rear part of the hull is known as the [[stern]], and many hulls have a flat back known as a [[transom (nautical)|transom]]. Common hull appendages include [[propeller]]s for propulsion, [[rudder]]s for steering, and [[Stabilizer (ship)|stabilizers]] to quell a ship's rolling motion. Other hull features can be related to the vessel's work, such as fishing gear and [[sonar|sonar domes]].\n\nHulls are subject to various hydrostatic and hydrodynamic constraints. The key hydrostatic constraint is that it must be able to support the entire weight of the boat, and maintain stability even with often unevenly distributed weight. Hydrodynamic constraints include the ability to withstand shock waves, weather collisions and groundings.\n\nOlder ships and pleasure craft often have or had wooden hulls. Steel is used for most commercial vessels. Aluminium is frequently used for fast vessels, and [[composite material]]s are often found in sailboats and pleasure craft. Some ships have been made with [[Concrete ship|concrete hulls]].\n\n===Propulsion systems===\n{{Main|Marine propulsion}}\n[[File:Two Main Engines, V12.jpg|thumb|right|A ship's engine room]]\nPropulsion systems for ships fall into three categories: human propulsion, [[sailing]], and mechanical propulsion. Human propulsion includes [[Watercraft rowing|rowing]], which was used even on large [[galley]]s. Propulsion by sail generally consists of a sail hoisted on an erect mast, supported by stays and spars and controlled by ropes. Sail systems were the dominant form of propulsion until the 19th century. They are now generally used for recreation and competition, although experimental sail systems, such as the [[turbosail]]s, [[rotorsail]]s, and [[wingsail]]s have been used on larger modern vessels for fuel savings.\n\nMechanical [[propulsion systems]] generally consist of a motor or engine turning a [[propeller]], or less frequently, an [[impeller]] or [[Wave power ship|wave propulsion fins]]. [[Steam engine]]s were first used for this purpose, but have mostly been replaced by [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] or [[four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] diesel engines, outboard motors, and [[gas turbine engine]]s on faster ships. [[Nuclear marine propulsion|Nuclear reactors]] producing steam are used to propel [[warship]]s and [[icebreaker]]s, and there have been attempts to utilize them to power commercial vessels (see [[NS Savannah|NS ''Savannah'']]).\n\nIn addition to traditional fixed and controllable pitch propellers there are many specialized variations, such as contra-rotating and nozzle-style propellers. Most vessels have a single propeller, but some large vessels may have up to four propellers supplemented with [[bow thruster|transverse thrusters]] for maneuvring at ports. The propeller is connected to the main engine via a propeller shaft and, in case of medium- and high-speed engines, a reduction gearbox. Some modern vessels have a [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric powertrain]] in which the propeller is turned by an [[electric motor]] powered by the ship's generators.\n\n=== Steering systems ===\n[[File:Ferry-rudder-and-propeller.jpg|thumb|right|The rudder and propeller on a newly built [[Ferryboat|ferry]]]]\n\nFor ships with independent propulsion systems for each side, such as manual oars or some [[paddle steamer|paddles]],{{NoteTag|Almost all paddle steamers had a single engine with their paddles permanently coupled, without any clutches, and so could not be used for steering. Only a few examples with separate engines were steerable. The [[Royal Navy]] however operated diesel-electric harbour tugs with paddles into the 1970s, for their superior maneuverability.}} steering systems may not be necessary. In most designs, such as boats propelled by engines or sails, a steering system becomes necessary. The most common is a rudder, a submerged plane located at the rear of the hull. Rudders are rotated to generate a lateral force which turns the boat. Rudders can be rotated by a [[tiller]], manual wheels, or electro-hydraulic systems. [[Autopilot]] systems combine mechanical rudders with navigation systems. [[Ducted propeller]]s are sometimes used for steering.\n\nSome propulsion systems are inherently steering systems. Examples include the [[outboard motor]], the [[bow thruster]], and the [[Z-drive]].\n\n===Holds, compartments, and the superstructure===\nLarger boats and ships generally have multiple decks and compartments. Separate [[berthing]]s and [[Head (watercraft)|heads]] are found on sailboats over about {{convert|25|ft|m}}. Fishing boats and cargo ships typically have one or more cargo holds. Most larger vessels have an engine room, a [[galley (kitchen)|galley]], and various compartments for work. Tanks are used to store fuel, engine oil, and fresh water. Ballast tanks are equipped to change a ship's trim and modify its stability.\n\nSuperstructures are found above the main deck. On sailboats, these are usually very low. On modern cargo ships, they are almost always located near the ship's stern. On passenger ships and warships, the superstructure generally extends far forward.\n\n===Equipment===\nShipboard equipment varies from ship to ship depending on such factors as the ship's era, design, area of operation, and purpose. Some types of equipment that are widely found include:\n* [[Mast (sail)|Masts]] can be the home of antennas, navigation lights, radar transponders, fog signals, and similar devices often required by law.\n* [[Ground tackle]] includes equipment such as mooring winches, windlasses, and anchors. Anchors are used to [[mooring (watercraft)|moor]] ships in shallow water. They are connected to the ship by a rope or chain. On larger vessels, the chain runs through a [[hawsepipe]].\n* Cargo equipment such as [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[cargo boom]]s are used to load and unload cargo and ship's stores.\n* Safety equipment such as [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], [[liferaft]]s, and [[survival suit]]s are carried aboard many vessels for emergency use.\n\n==Design considerations==\n{{more citations needed section|date = February 2017}}\n\n===Hydrostatics===\n{{main|Fluid statics}}\nShips float in the water at a level where mass of the displaced water equals the mass of the vessel, such that the downwards force of [[gravity]] equals the upward force of [[buoyancy]]. As a vessel is lowered into the water its weight remains constant but the corresponding weight of water displaced by its hull increases. If the vessel's mass is evenly distributed throughout, it floats evenly along its length and across its [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width). A vessel's stability is considered in both this [[Initial stability|hydrostatic]] sense as well as a [[Ship stability|hydrodynamic]] sense, when subjected to movement, rolling and pitching, and the action of waves and wind. Stability problems can lead to excessive pitching and rolling, and eventually capsizing and sinking.{{citation needed|date = February 2017}}\n\n===Hydrodynamics===\n{{main|Fluid dynamics}}\n[[File:Bugwinkel39.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the {{ship|German battleship|Schlesien}}, showing a 39\u00b0 [[wake]], characteristic of vessels passing through water.]]\n[[File:Brosen shipsmovemensonthewave.svg|thumb|Vessels move along the three axes: 1.&nbsp;heave, 2.&nbsp;sway, 3.&nbsp;surge, 4.&nbsp;yaw, 5.&nbsp;pitch, 6.&nbsp;roll]]\nThe advance of a vessel through water is resisted by the water. This resistance can be broken down into several components, the main ones being the friction of the water on the hull and [[wave making resistance]]. To reduce resistance and therefore increase the speed for a given power, it is necessary to reduce the wetted surface and use submerged hull shapes that produce low amplitude waves. To do so, high-speed vessels are often more slender, with fewer or smaller appendages. The friction of the water is also reduced by regular maintenance of the hull to remove the sea creatures and algae that accumulate there. [[Antifouling]] paint is commonly used to assist in this. Advanced designs such as the [[bulbous bow]] assist in decreasing wave resistance.\n\nA simple way of considering wave-making resistance is to look at the hull in relation to its wake. At speeds lower than the wave propagation speed, the wave rapidly dissipates to the sides. As the hull approaches the wave propagation speed, however, the wake at the bow begins to build up faster than it can dissipate, and so it grows in [[amplitude]]. Since the water is not able to \"get out of the way of the hull fast enough\", the hull, in essence, has to climb over or push through the bow wave. This results in an [[exponential function|exponential]] increase in resistance with increasing speed.\n\nThis [[hull speed]] is found by the formula:\n\n{{block indent|<math>\\mbox{knots} \\approx 1.34 \\times \\sqrt{L \\mbox{ft}}</math>}}\n\nor, in [[metric system|metric]] units:\n\n{{block indent|<math>\\mbox{knots} \\approx 2.5 \\times \\sqrt{L \\mbox{m}}</math>}}\n\nwhere ''L'' is the length of the waterline in feet or meters.\n\nWhen the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 0.94, it starts to outrun most of its [[bow wave]], and the hull actually settles slightly in the water as it is now only supported by two wave peaks. As the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 1.34, the hull speed, the wavelength is now longer than the hull, and the stern is no longer supported by the wake, causing the stern to squat, and the bow rise. The hull is now starting to climb its own bow wave, and resistance begins to increase at a very high rate. While it is possible to drive a displacement hull faster than a speed/length ratio of 1.34, it is prohibitively expensive to do so. Most large vessels operate at speed/length ratios well below that level, at speed/length ratios of under 1.0.\n\nFor large projects with adequate funding, hydrodynamic resistance can be tested experimentally in a hull testing pool or using tools of [[computational fluid dynamics]].\n\nVessels are also subject to [[ocean surface wave]]s and [[sea swell]] as well as effects of [[wind]] and [[weather]]. These movements can be stressful for passengers and equipment, and must be controlled if possible. The rolling movement can be controlled, to an extent, by ballasting or by devices such as [[Stabilizer (ship)|fin stabilizers]]. Pitching movement is more difficult to limit and can be dangerous if the bow submerges in the waves, a phenomenon called pounding. Sometimes, ships must change course or speed to stop violent rolling or pitching.\n\nHow it has been convincingly shown in scientific studies of the 21st century,<ref name=\"a-Feigin-2001ru\">{{cite journal|last1=Feigin |first1=M I |script-title=ru:\u041f\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u0444\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0431\u0438\u0444\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b |trans-title=Manifestation of the bifurcation memory effect in behaviour of dynamic system |url=http://journal.issep.rssi.ru/ |journal=Soros Educational Journal |type=journal |year=2001 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=121\u201327 |language=ru|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130004824/http://journal.issep.rssi.ru/ |archivedate=November 30, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"a-Feigin-2004\">{{cite journal |last1 = Feigin |first1 = M|last2 = Kagan |first2 = M |title = Emergencies as a manifestation of effect of bifurcation memory in controlled unstable systems|journal = International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos |type = journal |year = 2004 |volume = 14 |issue = 7 |pages = 2439\u201347 |doi = 10.1142/S0218127404010746 |issn = 0218-1274}}</ref> controllability of some vessels decreases dramatically in some cases that are conditioned by effects of the [[bifurcation memory]].

The first is usually an initial contract to build the ship, the details of which can vary widely based on relationships between the [[shipowner]]s, operators, [[naval architect|designers]] and the [[shipyard]]. Then, the design phase carried out by a naval architect. Then the ship is constructed in a shipyard. After construction, the vessel is launched and goes into service. Ships end their careers in a number of ways, ranging from [[shipwreck]]s to service as a [[museum ship]] to [[Ship breaking|the scrapyard]].\n\n===Design===\n{{See also|Naval architecture}}\nA vessel's design starts with a specification, which a [[naval architect]] uses to create a project outline, assess required dimensions, and create a basic layout of spaces and a rough displacement. After this initial rough draft, the architect can create an initial hull design, a general profile and an initial overview of the ship's propulsion. At this stage, the designer can iterate on the ship's design, adding detail and refining the design at each stage.\n\nThe designer will typically produce an overall plan, a general specification describing the peculiarities of the vessel, and construction blueprints to be used at the building site. Designs for larger or more complex vessels may also include sail plans, electrical schematics, and plumbing and ventilation plans.\n\nAs environmental laws are becoming more strict, ship designers need to create their design in such a way that the ship, when it nears its end-of-term, can be [[Ship breaking|disassembled]] or [[Ship disposal|disposed]] easily and that waste is reduced to a minimum.\n\n===Construction===\n{{Main|Shipbuilding}}\n[[File:Brosen northern side lauching2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Ship naming and launching|ship launching]] at the Northern Shipyard in [[Gdansk, Poland]]]]\nShip construction takes place in a [[shipyard]], and can last from a few months for a unit produced in series, to several years to reconstruct a wooden boat like the frigate ''Hermione'', to more than 10&nbsp;years for an aircraft carrier. During [[World War II]], the need for cargo ships was so urgent that construction time for [[Liberty ship|Liberty Ships]] went from initially eight months or longer, down to weeks or even days. Builders employed production line and prefabrication techniques such as those used in shipyards today.<ref>Sawyer, L.A. and Mitchell, W.H.

The hull of a mass-produced fiberglass sailboat is constructed from a mold, while the steel hull of a cargo ship is made from large sections welded together as they are built.\n\nGenerally, construction starts with the hull, and on vessels over about {{convert|30|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, by the laying of the keel. This is done in a [[drydock]] or on land. Once the hull is assembled and painted, it is launched. The last stages, such as raising the superstructure and adding equipment and accommodation, can be done after the vessel is afloat.\n\nOnce completed, the vessel is delivered to the customer. [[Ship naming and launching|Ship launching]] is often a ceremony of some significance, and is usually when the vessel is formally named. A typical small rowboat can cost under US$100, $1,000 for a small speedboat, tens of thousands of dollars for a cruising sailboat, and about $2,000,000 for a [[Vend\u00e9e Globe]] class sailboat. A {{convert|25|m|ft|sp=us}} trawler may cost $2.5&nbsp;million, and a 1,000-person-capacity high-speed passenger ferry can cost in the neighborhood of $50&nbsp;million. A ship's cost partly depends on its complexity: a small, [[general cargo ship]] will cost $20&nbsp;million, a [[Panamax]]-sized [[bulk carrier]] around $35&nbsp;million, a [[supertanker]] around $105&nbsp;million and a large [[LNG carrier]] nearly $200&nbsp;million. The most expensive ships generally are so because of the cost of embedded electronics: a {{sclass-|Seawolf|submarine}} costs around $2&nbsp;billion, and an aircraft carrier goes for about $3.5&nbsp;billion.\n\n===Repair and conversion===\n[[File:Able-seaman-scaling-winch.JPG|thumb|[[Able seaman]] using a [[needlegun scaler]] on a mooring winch.]]\nShips undergo nearly constant maintenance during their career, whether they be underway, pierside, or in some cases, in periods of reduced operating status between charters or shipping seasons.\n\nMost ships, however, require trips to special facilities such as a [[drydock]] at regular intervals. Tasks often done at drydock include removing biological growths on the hull, [[sandblasting]] and repainting the hull, and replacing [[sacrificial anode]]s used to protect submerged equipment from corrosion. Major repairs to the propulsion and steering systems as well as major electrical systems are also often performed at dry dock.\n\nSome vessels that sustain major damage at sea may be repaired at a facility equipped for major repairs, such as a shipyard. Ships may also be converted for a new purpose: [[oil tanker]]s are often converted into [[floating production storage and offloading unit]]s.\n\n===End of service===\n{{Main|Ship disposal}}\n[[File:Jafrabad Chittagong shipbreaking (8).JPG|thumb|Workers drag steel plate ashore from beached ships in [[Chittagong]], Bangladesh]]\n\nMost ocean-going cargo ships have a life expectancy of between 20 and 30&nbsp;years. A sailboat made of plywood or fiberglass can last between 30 and 40&nbsp;years. Solid wooden ships can last much longer but require regular maintenance. Carefully maintained steel-hulled yachts can have a lifespan of over 100&nbsp;years.\n\nAs ships age, forces such as corrosion, osmosis, and rotting compromise hull strength, and a vessel becomes too dangerous to sail. At this point, it can be [[scuttling|scuttled]] at sea or [[Ship breaking|scrapped]] by [[ship breaking|shipbreakers]]. Ships can also be used as [[museum ships]], or expended to construct [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] or [[artificial reef]]s.\n\nMany ships do not make it to the scrapyard, and are lost in fires, collisions, [[ship grounding|grounding]], or sinking at sea. The Allies lost some 5,150 ships during [[World War II]].<ref>''Sea Lanes in Wartime \u2013 The American Experience 1775\u20131945'', 2nd edition, by Albion, Robert Greenhalgh and Pope, Jennie Barnes, Archon Books, 1968.</ref>\n\n== Measuring ships ==\n{{more citations needed section|date = February 2017}}\nOne can [[Molded depth|measure ships]] in terms of [[overall length]], [[length between perpendiculars]], [[Waterline length|length of the ship at the waterline]], [[Beam (nautical)|beam (breadth)]], depth (distance between the crown of the weather deck and the top of the keelson), [[Draft (hull)|draft]] (distance between the highest waterline and the bottom of the ship) and [[tonnage]]. A number of different tonnage definitions exist and are used when describing merchant ships for the purpose of tolls, taxation, etc.\n\nIn Britain until [[Samuel Plimsoll]]'s [[Merchant Shipping Act of 1876]], ship-owners could load their vessels until their decks were almost awash, resulting in a dangerously unstable condition. Anyone who signed on to such a ship for a voyage and, upon realizing the danger, chose to leave the ship, could end up in [[jail]]. Plimsoll, a [[Member of Parliament]], realised the problem and engaged some [[engineer]]s to derive a fairly simple [[formula]] to determine the position of a line on the side of any specific ship's hull which, when it reached the surface of the water during loading of cargo, meant the ship had reached its maximum safe loading level. To this day, that mark, called the \"[[waterline|Plimsoll Line]]\", exists on ships' sides, and consists of a [[circle]] with a horizontal line through the centre. On the Great Lakes of North America the circle is replaced with a diamond. Because different types of water (summer, fresh, tropical fresh, winter north Atlantic) have different densities, subsequent regulations required painting a group of lines forward of the Plimsoll mark to indicate the safe depth (or freeboard above the surface) to which a specific ship could load in water of various densities. Hence the \"ladder\" of lines seen forward of the Plimsoll mark to this day. This is called the \"[[freeboard mark]]\" or \"[[waterline#Standard load line marks|load line mark]]\" in the [[marine industry]].\n\n==Ship pollution==\nShip pollution is the pollution of air and water by [[shipping]]. It is a problem that has been accelerating as trade has become increasingly globalized, posing an increasing threat to the world's oceans and waterways as [[globalization]] continues. It is expected that \"shipping traffic to and from the United States is projected to double by 2020.\"<ref name=\"Watson\">Watson, T. (2004, August 30). Ship pollution clouds USA's skies.

The pollution produced affects [[biodiversity]], climate, food, and human health. However, the degree to which humans are polluting and how it affects the world is highly debated and has been a hot international topic for the past 30&nbsp;years.\n\n===Oil spills===\n{{Main|Oil spill}}\n[[File:OilCleanupAfterValdezSpill.jpg|thumb|right| The tanker [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' spilled]] {{convert|10800000|USgal|impgal L|sigfig=4}} of oil into Alaska's [[Prince William Sound]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions about the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill |url=http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/History/FAQ.htm |publisher=State of Alaska |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925163639/http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/History/FAQ.htm |archivedate=2006-09-25}}</ref>]]\nOil spills have devastating effects on the environment.

An oil tanker can carry {{convert|2|Moilbbl|m3|sigfig=4}} of crude oil, or {{convert|84000000|USgal|impgal L|sigfig=4}}<!-- See [[Talk:ship#conversions]] -->. This is more than six times the amount spilled in the widely known [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' incident]]. In this spill, the ship ran aground and dumped {{convert|10800000|USgal|impgal L|sigfig=4}} of oil into the ocean in March 1989.

Following the sinkings of ''[[Erika (tanker)|Erika]]'' (1999) and ''[[Prestige oil spill|Prestige]]'' (2002), the [[European Union]] passed its own stringent anti-pollution packages (known as Erika I, II, and III), which require all tankers entering its waters to be double-hulled by 2010. The Erika packages are controversial because they introduced the new legal concept of \"serious negligence\".<ref>{{cite book |author=European Parliament |authorlink=European Parliament |title=Directive 2005/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements|year=2005 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:255:0011:01:EN:HTML |accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Ballast water===\n{{Main|Ballast water discharge and the environment}}\n[[File:Ship pumping ballast water.jpg|thumb|upright|A cargo ship pumps ballast water over the side]]\nWhen a large vessel such as a [[container ship]] or an oil tanker unloads cargo, seawater is pumped into other compartments in the hull to help stabilize and balance the ship.

''[[Mnemiopsis leidyi]]'', a species of comb jellyfish that inhabits estuaries from the United States to the Vald\u00e9s peninsula in [[Argentina]] along the [[Atlantic]] coast, has caused notable damage in the [[Black Sea]]. It was first introduced in 1982, and thought to have been transported to the Black Sea in a ship's ballast water. The population of the jellyfish shot up exponentially and, by 1988, it was wreaking havoc upon the local [[fishing]] industry. \"The [[anchovy]] catch fell from {{convert|204000|t|ST LT|sigfig=3|lk=on}} in 1984 to {{convert|200|t|ST LT|sigfig=3}} in 1993; sprat from {{convert|24600|t|ST LT|sigfig=3}} in 1984 to {{convert|12000|t|ST LT|sigfig=3}} in 1993; [[horse mackerel (disambiguation)|horse mackerel]] from {{convert|4000|t|ST LT|sigfig=3}} in 1984 to zero in 1993.\"<ref name=\"Meinesz\"/> Now that the jellyfish have exhausted the [[zooplankton]], including fish larvae, their numbers have fallen dramatically, yet they continue to maintain a stranglehold on the [[ecosystem]]. Recently the jellyfish have been discovered in the [[Caspian Sea]]. Invasive species can take over once occupied areas, facilitate the spread of new [[diseases]], introduce new [[Genetics|genetic]] material, alter landscapes and jeopardize the ability of native species to obtain food. \"On land and in the sea, invasive species are responsible for about 137&nbsp;billion dollars in lost revenue and management costs in the U.S. each year.\"<ref name=\"Panetta\">Panetta, L.E.

Most ships have a lifespan of a few decades before there is so much wear that refitting and repair becomes uneconomical. Ship breaking allows materials from the ship, especially steel, to be reused.\n\n[[File:Shipbreakingbangladesh2.jpg|thumb|Ship breaking near [[Chittagong]], [[Bangladesh]]]]\nIn addition to steel and other useful materials, however, ships (particularly older vessels) can contain many substances that are banned or considered dangerous in [[developed countries]]. [[Asbestos]] and [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) are typical examples. Asbestos was used heavily in ship construction until it was finally banned in most of the developed world in the mid 1980s. Currently, the costs associated with removing asbestos, along with the potentially expensive insurance and health risks, have meant that ship-breaking in most developed countries is no longer economically viable. Removing the metal for scrap can potentially cost more than the scrap value of the metal itself. In most of the developing world, however, shipyards can operate without the risk of [[Personal injury|personal injury lawsuits]] or [[Workers' compensation|workers' health claims]], meaning many of these shipyards may operate with high health risks. Furthermore, workers are paid very low rates with no overtime or other allowances. Protective equipment is sometimes absent or inadequate. Dangerous vapors and fumes from burning materials can be inhaled, and dusty asbestos-laden areas around such breakdown locations are commonplace.\n\nAside from the health of the yard workers, in recent years, ship breaking has also become an issue of major [[environmentalism|environmental concern]]. Many developing nations, in which ship breaking yards are located, have lax or no [[environmental law]], enabling large quantities of highly toxic materials to escape into the environment and causing serious health problems among ship breakers, the local population and wildlife. Environmental campaign groups such as [[Greenpeace]] have made the issue a high priority for their campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/ |title=Shipbreaking |publisher=Greenpeace |date=March 16, 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021012054547/http://www.greenpeaceweb.org/shipbreak/ |archivedate=October 12, 2002}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Transport}}<br>\n\n\n\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Admiralty law]]\n* [[Airship]]\n* [[Auxiliary ship]]\n* [[Boat]]\n* [[Chartering (shipping)]]\n* [[Dynamic positioning]]\n* [[Environmental impact of shipping]]\n* [[Factory ship]]\n* [[Ferry]]\n* [[Flag state]]\n* [[Fluyt]]\n* [[Galleon]]\n* [[Galley]]\n* [[Glossary of nautical terms]]\n* [[Marine electronics]]\n* [[Marine fuel management]]\n* [[Maritime history]]\n* [[Mother ship]]\n* [[Naval architecture]]\n* [[Naval ship]]\n* [[Navy]]\n* [[Nuclear marine propulsion]]\n* [[Propulsion]]\n* [[Sailing]]\n* [[Sailing ship]]\n* [[Sailor]]\n* [[Ship burial]]\n* [[Ship transport]]\n* [[Shipwreck]]\n* [[Spacecraft|Spaceship]]\n* [[Train ferry]]\n* [[Vessel safety survey]]\n* [[Warship]]\n* [[Watercraft]]\n* [[Whaler]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Model ships'''\n* [[Ship model]]\n* [[Ship model basin]]\n* [[Ship replica]]\n\n'''Lists'''\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[List of fictional ships]]\n* [[List of historical ship types]]\n* [[List of Panamax ports]]\n* [[List of largest cruise ships]]\n* [[List of world's largest ships by gross tonnage]]\n* [[List of world's longest ships]]\n* [[Lists of ships]]\n* [[Lists of shipwrecks]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Ship sizes'''\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Aframax]]\n* [[Capesize]]\n* [[Chinamax]]\n* [[Handymax]]\n* [[Handysize]]\n* [[Maersk Triple E class]]\n* [[Malaccamax]]\n* [[Panamax]]\n* [[Q-Max]]\n* [[Seawaymax]]\n* [[Suezmax]]\n* [[Oil tanker|Ultra Large Crude Carrier]]\n* [[Valemax]]\n* [[Oil tanker|VLCC]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n  | first = Steven\n  | last = Anzovin\n  | title = Famous First Facts (International Edition)\n  | publisher = H.W.
