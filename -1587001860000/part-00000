{"title_page": "Anonymous post", "text_new": "{{short description|Entry on a bulletin board system, Internet forum, or other discussion forums, without a screen name}}\nAn '''anonymous post''' is an entry on a [[bulletin board system]], [[Internet forum]], or other discussion forums, without a [[User (computing)|screen name]] or more commonly by using a non-identifiable [[pseudonym]].\nSome online forums such as [[Slashdot]] and [[Techdirt]] do not allow such posts, requiring users to be registered either under their [[personal name|real name]] or utilizing a [[pseudonym]]. Others like [[JuicyCampus]], [[AutoAdmit]], [[2channel]], and other [[Futaba Channel|Futaba]]-based [[imageboards]] (such as [[4chan]]) and AnonymousBoard.LikesYou.org thrive on anonymity. Users of 4chan, in particular, interact in an anonymous and ephemeral environment that facilitates rapid generation of new trends.\n\n==History of online anonymity==\nOnline anonymity can be traced to [[Usenet]] [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroup]]s in the late 1990s where the notion of using invalid emails for posting to newsgroups was introduced. This was primarily used for discussion on newsgroups pertaining to certain sensitive topics. There was also the introduction of [[anonymous remailers]] which were capable of stripping away the sender's address from mail packets before sending them to the receiver. Online services which facilitated anonymous posting sprang up around mid-1992, originating with the [[cypherpunk]] group.<ref>Rigby, Karina, [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall95-papers/rigby-anonymity.html \"Anonymity on the Internet Must Be Protected\"]</ref>\n\nThe precursor to Internet forums like [[2channel]] and [[4chan]] were [[textboard]]s like Ayashii World and Amezou World that provided the ability for anonymous posts in [[Japan]]. These \"large-scale anonymous textboards\" were inspired by the Usenet culture and were primarily focused on technology, unlike their descendants.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130414101236/http://www.bienvenidoainternet.org/wiki/Ayashii_World \"Ayashii World\"]</ref>\n\nToday, image boards receive tremendous internet traffic from all parts of the world. In 2011, on 4chan's most popular board, /b/, there were roughly 35,000 threads and 400,000 posts created per day. At that time, that level of content was on par with [[YouTube]]. Such high traffic suggests a broad demand from internet users for anonymous content sharing sites.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n==Levels of anonymity==\nAnonymity on the Internet can pertain to both the utilization of [[pseudonym]]s or requiring no authentication at all (also called \"perfect anonymity\") for posting on a website.<ref>Furukawa, Hideki,[http://www.ojr.org/japan/internet/1061505583.php \"Q&A With the Founder of Channel 2\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109111255/http://www.ojr.org/japan/internet/1061505583.php |date=January 9, 2013 }}, ''The Online Journalism Review'', August 22, 2008</ref> Online anonymity is also limited by [[IP address]]es. For example, [[WikiScanner]] associates anonymous Wikipedia edits with the IP address that made the change and tries to identify the entity that owns the IP address. On other websites, IP addresses may not be publicly available, but they can be obtained from the website administrators only through legal intervention. They might not always be traceable to the poster.<ref>[http://ask-leo.com/just_how_do_websites_track_or_monitor_our_activity.html \"Just how do websites track or monitor our activity?\"]</ref>\n\n==Techniques==\nUtilizing [[pseudonym]]s allow people to post without revealing their real identity. Pseudonyms, however, are still prone to being tracked to the user's [[IP address]].<ref name=atgtab>{{Cite web |url=http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/internet/page6042.cfm |title=A Technical Guide to Anonymous Blogging |access-date=2009-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402130911/http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/internet/page6042.cfm |archive-date=2009-04-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To avoid being tracked to an IP address, it is possible to post via a [[public computer]] where the IP address would usually be under the purview of the public workspace such as a [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]], and hence cannot be traced to the individual user.<ref name=\"atgtab\"/>\n\n===Memes===\nAnother way people are posting anonymously online is through the use of [[Internet meme|memes]]. One popular meme is the Confession Bear meme. People use Confession Bear to post everything from funny and embarrassing stories to very troubled thoughts.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The curious case of Confession Bear: the reappropriation of online macro-image memes|last = Vickery|first = Jacqueline Ryan|date = January 2, 2014|journal = Information, Communication & Society|doi = 10.1080/1369118X.2013.871056|pmid =|volume=17|issue = 3|pages=301\u2013325}}<!--|accessdate = October 22, 2014--></ref>\n\n===Technology===\nThere are services described as [[anonymizer]]s which aim to provide users the ability to post anonymously by hiding their identifying information. Anonymizers are essentially [[proxy server]]s which act as an intermediary between the user who wants to post anonymously and the website which logs user information such as IP addresses. The proxy server is the only computer in this network which is aware of the user's information and provides its own information to anonymize the poster.<ref>Confinet Ltd. \"[http://www.anonic.org/anonymous-surfing.html Anonymous Surfing]\", AnonIC.org, 2004</ref> Examples of such anonymizers include [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], which employ techniques such as [[onion routing|onion]] and [[garlic routing]] to provide enhanced [[encryption]] to messages that travel through multiple proxy servers.<ref name=atgtab />\n\nApplications like [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] utilizing techniques like [[Symmetric-key algorithm|private-key]] and [[Public-key cryptography|public-key]] encryptions are also utilized by users to post content in Usenet groups and other online forums.<ref name=mehtaandplaza>{{cite book |last1=Mehta |first1=Michael |last2=Plaza |first2=Dwaine |editor-last=Keisler |editor-first=Sara |title=Culture of the Internet |publisher=Lawrence Eribaum Associates |date=April 3, 1997 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cultureofinterne0000kies/page/53 53\u201369] |chapter=Chapter 3: Pornography in Cyberspace: An Exploration of What's in Usenet |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2gekEf3i3IC&lpg=PA53&ots=AxVu7aNXem&dq=anonymity%20pornography&lr&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=0805816364 |lastauthoramp=y |url=https://archive.org/details/cultureofinterne0000kies/page/53 }}</ref>\n\n==Legal standards and regulations==\n{{main|Doe subpoena}}\n\n===China===\nThe revised draft of the [[China|Chinese]] government's \"Internet Information Services\"<ref>[http://www.scio.gov.cn/zxbd/zcfg/201206/t1169111.htm \"Internet Information Services (revised draft)\"], June 7, 2012</ref> proposes that \"Internet information service providers, including [[microblog]]s, forums, and blogs, that allow users to post information on the Internet should ensure users are registered with their real identities\".<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/07/us-china-internet-idUSBRE8560AM20120607 \"China Proposes Strengthening Internet Guidelines\"], ''Reuters'', June 7, 2012</ref> Starting October 1, 2017, it will require internet users to identify themselves with their real names to use comments sections on news and social media websites.<ref>[http://supchina.com/2017/08/25/china-ban-anonymous-online-comments-chinas-latest-society-culture-news/ China to ban anonymous online comments \u2013 China\u2019s latest society and culture news] </ref> \n\n===The Philippines===\nThe [[Philippines|Philippine]] government passed the [[Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012|Cybercrime Prevention Act]] on 12 September 2012, which among other things grants the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] the ability to \"block access to 'computer data' that is in violation of the Act; in other words, a website hosting criminally [[libel]]ous speech could be shut down without a court order\".<ref>Jillian C.

The defence is defeated if it was not possible for the claimant to identify the person who posted the statement.\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], the right to speak anonymously online is protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and various [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act|other laws]]. These laws restrict the ability of the government and civil litigants to obtain the identity of anonymous speakers.

Others like [[JuicyCampus]], [[AutoAdmit]], [[2channel]], and other [[Futaba Channel|Futaba]]-based [[imageboards]] (such as [[4chan]]) thrive on anonymity. Users of 4chan, in particular, interact in an anonymous and ephemeral environment that facilitates rapid generation of new trends.\n\n==History of online anonymity==\nOnline anonymity can be traced to [[Usenet]] [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroup]]s in the late 1990s where the notion of using invalid emails for posting to newsgroups was introduced. This was primarily used for discussion on newsgroups pertaining to certain sensitive topics. There was also the introduction of [[anonymous remailers]] which were capable of stripping away the sender's address from mail packets before sending them to the receiver. Online services which facilitated anonymous posting sprang up around mid-1992, originating with the [[cypherpunk]] group.<ref>Rigby, Karina, [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall95-papers/rigby-anonymity.html \"Anonymity on the Internet Must Be Protected\"]</ref>\n\nThe precursor to Internet forums like [[2channel]] and [[4chan]] were [[textboard]]s like Ayashii World and Amezou World that provided the ability for anonymous posts in [[Japan]]. These \"large-scale anonymous textboards\" were inspired by the Usenet culture and were primarily focused on technology, unlike their descendants.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130414101236/http://www.bienvenidoainternet.org/wiki/Ayashii_World \"Ayashii World\"]</ref>\n\nToday, image boards receive tremendous internet traffic from all parts of the world. In 2011, on 4chan's most popular board, /b/, there were roughly 35,000 threads and 400,000 posts created per day. At that time, that level of content was on par with [[YouTube]]. Such high traffic suggests a broad demand from internet users for anonymous content sharing sites.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n==Levels of anonymity==\nAnonymity on the Internet can pertain to both the utilization of [[pseudonym]]s or requiring no authentication at all (also called \"perfect anonymity\") for posting on a website.<ref>Furukawa, Hideki,[http://www.ojr.org/japan/internet/1061505583.php \"Q&A With the Founder of Channel 2\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109111255/http://www.ojr.org/japan/internet/1061505583.php |date=January 9, 2013 }}, ''The Online Journalism Review'', August 22, 2008</ref> Online anonymity is also limited by [[IP address]]es. For example, [[WikiScanner]] associates anonymous Wikipedia edits with the IP address that made the change and tries to identify the entity that owns the IP address. On other websites, IP addresses may not be publicly available, but they can be obtained from the website administrators only through legal intervention. They might not always be traceable to the poster.<ref>[http://ask-leo.com/just_how_do_websites_track_or_monitor_our_activity.html \"Just how do websites track or monitor our activity?\"]</ref>\n\n==Techniques==\nUtilizing [[pseudonym]]s allow people to post without revealing their real identity.
