The competitive sports that promote this physical leanness may result in disordered eating and be responsible for the origin of the female athlete triad. For some women, the disorder can have major health consequences.<ref name=\"KidsHealth\">{{cite web|title=Female Athlete Triad|url=http://kidshealth.org/teen/food_fitness/sports/triad.html|publisher=KidsHealth|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref> In addition, for some competitive female athletes, problems such as low self-esteem, a tendency toward perfectionism, and family stress place them at risk for disordered eating.<ref name=\"KidsHealth\"/>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nClinical symptoms of the Triad may include disordered eating, fatigue, hair loss, cold hands and feet, dry skin, noticeable weight loss, increased healing time from injuries (e.g., lingering bruises), increased incidence of bone fracture and cessation of menses.<ref>Eguiguren, M.L. & Ackerman, K.E. (2016). The female athlete triad. In C. Stein, A. Stracciolini, & K. Ackerman (Eds.), ''The young female athlete'' (p. 64). Switzerland, Springer International Publishing.</ref>  Affected athletes may also struggle with low self-esteem and depression.\n\nUpon physical examination, a physician may also note the following symptoms: elevated carotene in the blood, [[anemia]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], electrolyte irregularities, [[hypoestrogenism]], [[Atrophic vaginitis|vaginal atrophy]], and [[bradycardia]].<ref name=\"Nattiv\"/><ref name=\"Hobart\"/>\n\nAn athlete may show signs of restrictive eating, but not meet the clinical criteria for an eating disorder. She may also display subtle menstrual disturbances, such as a change in menstrual cycle length, anovulation, or luteal phase defects, but not yet have developed complete amenorrhea. Likewise, an athlete's bone density may decrease, but may not yet have dropped below her age-matched normal range. These signs can be considered \"occult,\" as no one symptom may be severe enough to seek medical attention, leaving the Triad to go unnoticed or untreated.<ref name=\"What is the Triad\"/>\n\n===Disordered eating===\n{{main|Disordered eating}}\nEnergy availability is defined as energy intake minus energy expended.  Energy is taken in through food consumption.  Our bodies expend energy through normal functioning as well as through exercise.  In the case of female athlete triad, low energy availability may be due to eating disorders, but not necessarily so. Athletes may experience low energy availability by exercising more without a concomitant change in eating habits, or they may increase their energy expenditure while also eating less.<ref name=\"Nattiv\"/> Disordered eating is defined among this situation due to the low caloric intake or low energy availability.\n\nWhile most athletes do not meet the clinical criteria to be diagnosed with an eating disorder such as [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia nervosa]], many will exhibit disordered eating habits such as fasting, as well as avoiding certain types of food the athlete thinks are \"bad\" (such as foods containing fat).<ref name=\"KidsHealth\"/><ref name=\"Hobart\"/> More severe examples of disordered eating habits may include [[binge-eating]]; [[vomiting|purging]]; and the use of diet-pills, [[laxatives]], [[diuretics]], and [[enemas]].<ref name=\"Nattiv\"/>\n\nBy restricting their diet, the athlete may worsen their problem of low energy availability. Having low dietary energy from excessive exercise and/or dietary restrictions leaves too little energy for the body to carry out normal functions such as maintaining a regular menstrual cycle or healthy bone density.<ref name=\"Nattiv\"/>\n\n===Amenorrhea===\n{{main|Amenorrhea|Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea}}\nAmenorrhea, defined as the cessation of a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle for more than three months, is the second disorder in the Triad.  Weight fluctuations from dietary restrictions and/or excessive exercise affect the hypothalamus\u2019s output of gonadotropic hormones.  Gonadotropic hormones \u201cstimulate growth of the gonads and the secretion of sex hormones.\u201d<ref>Online Medical Dictionary. 1997. Center for Cancer Education. <http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?action=Search+OMD&query=gonadotropins> Retrieved on 2007-10-24.</ref>  (e.g. gonadotropin-releasing hormone, lutenizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone.)  These gonadotropic hormones play a role in stimulating estrogen release from the ovaries.  Without estrogen release, the menstrual cycle is disrupted.<ref>Menstruation and the Menstrual Cycle. The National Women\u2019s Health Information Center. 2007. < http://www.4women.gov/FAQ/menstru.htm> Retrieved on 2007-10-19.</ref> Exercising intensely and not eating enough calories can lead to decreases in estrogen, the hormone that helps to regulate the menstrual cycle. As a result, periods may become irregular or stop altogether.<ref name=\"KidsHealth\"/>\n\nThere are two types of amenorrhea.  A woman who has been having her period and then stops menstruating for ninety days or more is said to have secondary amenorrhea. In the case of RED-S, the majority of secondary amenorrhea cases are attributed to [[Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea|Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA),]] an adaptive mechanism to preserve energy for survival and vital processes rather than reproduction when energy balance is low.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Allaway | first1 = HC | last2 = Southmayd | first2 = EA | last3 = De Souza | first3 = MJ | date = Feb 2016 | title = The physiology of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea associated with energy deficiency in exercising women and in women with anorexia nervosa | url = | journal = Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 91\u2013119 | doi = 10.1515/hmbci-2015-0053 | pmid = 26953710 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mountjoy | first1 = M | last2 = Sundot-Borgen | first2 = JK | last3 = Burke | first3 = LM | last4 = Ackerman | first4 = KE | last5 = Blauwet | first5 = C | last6 = Constantini | first6 = N. | last7 = Budgett | first7 = R. | year = 2018| title = IOC consensus statement on relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S): 2018 update | url = | journal = Br J Sports Med | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 687\u2013697 | doi = 10.1136/bjsports-2018-099193 | pmid = 29773536 }}</ref> Primary amenorrhea is characterized by delayed [[menarche]] (the onset of menses during puberty).  Delayed menarche may be associated with delay of the development of secondary sexual characteristics.<ref name=\"Nattiv\"/>\n\n===Osteoporosis===\n{{main|Osteoporosis}}\nOsteoporosis is defined by the National Institutes of Health as \u2018\u2018a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture.\u2019\u2019<ref>Osteoporosis. 2006. National Institutes of Health. <http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Osteoporosis/default.asp> Retrieved on 2007-10-24.</ref> Low estrogen levels and poor nutrition, especially low calcium intake, can lead to osteoporosis, the third aspect of the triad. This condition can ruin a female athlete's career because it may lead to stress fractures and other injuries.<ref name=\"KidsHealth\"/>\n\nPatients with female athlete triad get osteoporosis due to hypoestrogenemia, or low estrogen levels.  With estrogen deficiency, the osteoclasts live longer and are therefore able to resorb more bone. In response to the increased bone resorption, there is increased bone formation and a high-turnover state develops which leads to bone loss and perforation of the trabecular plates.<ref>Ott, Susan. 2007. Estrogen: Mechanism of Bone Action. Department of Medicine University of Washington. < http://courses.washington.edu/bonephys/esteffects.html> Retrieved on 2007-10-24.</ref>  As osteoclasts break down bone, patients see a loss of bone mineral density.  Low bone mineral density renders bones more brittle and hence susceptible to fracture.  Because athletes are active and their bones must endure mechanical stress, the likelihood of experiencing bone fracture is particularly high.<ref name=\"Nattiv\"/>\n\nAdditionally, because those suffering with female athlete triad are also restricting their diet, they may also not be consuming sufficient amounts vitamins and minerals which contribute to bone density; not getting enough [[calcium]] or [[vitamin D]] further exacerbates the problem of weak bones.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/>\n\nBone mass is now thought to peak between the ages of 18-25.  Thus, behaviors which result in low bone density in youth could be detrimental to an athlete\u2019s bone health throughout her lifetime.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/>\n\nIn addition, ovulation is the primary way that females create the hormone progesterone. When an ovum is released from the ovary, the structure that remains develops into the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum emits the hormone progesterone during the 10\u201316 days of the luteal phase. Without experiencing regular, ovulatory menstrual cycles, the female is not secreting the hormone progesterone during the luteal phase of her cycle. Progesterone directly stimulates osteoblasts to make new bone. Therefore if the woman is not ovulating, she is not creating progesterone, and misses out on this opportunity to stimulate new bone growth.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 2968416|year = 2010|last1 = Seifert-Klauss|first1 = V.|title = Progesterone and Bone: Actions Promoting Bone Health in Women|journal = Journal of Osteoporosis|volume = 2010|pages = 1\u201318|last2 = Prior|first2 = J.

Prevention, recognition, and treatment of these clinical conditions should be a priority of those who work with female athletes to ensure that they maximize the benefits of regular exercise.<ref name=\"Medicine & Science\"/>\n\nPatients are recommended to work with a dietician who can monitor their nutritional status and help the patient work towards a healthy goal weight.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> Patients should also meet with a psychiatrist or psychologist to address the psychological aspects of the triad.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> Therefore, it is important that trainers and coaches are made aware of the athlete\u2019s condition and be part of her recovery.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/>\n\n===Medicine===\nPatients are also sometimes treated pharmacologically. To both induce menses and improve bone density, doctors may prescribe cyclic [[estrogen]] or [[progesterone]] as is used to treat post-menopausal women.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> Patients may also be put on oral contraceptives to stimulate regular periods.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> In addition to hormone therapy, nutrition supplements may be recommended.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> Doctors may prescribe calcium supplements.  Vitamin D supplements may be also used because this vitamin aids in calcium absorption.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> [[Bisphosphonates]] and [[calcitonin]], used to treat adults with osteoporosis, may be prescribed, although their effectiveness in adolescents has not yet been established.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> Finally, if indicated by a psychiatric examination, the affected athlete may be prescribed anti-depressants and in some cases benzodiazepines to help in alleviating severe distress at mealtimes.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nSustained low energy availability, with or without disordered eating, can impair health. Psychological problems associated with eating disorders include low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety disorders. Medical complications involve the cardiovascular, endocrine, reproductive, skeletal, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems. The prognosis for anorexia nervosa is grave with a six-fold increase in standard mortality rates compared to the general population. In one study, 5.4% of athletes with eating disorders reported suicide attempts. Although 83% of anorexia nervosa patients partially recover, the rate of sustained recovery of weight, menstrual function and eating behavior is only 33%.<ref name=\"Medicine & Science\"/>\n\nAmenorrheic women can be infertile, due to the absence of ovarian follicular development, ovulation, and luteal function. Consequences of hypoestrogenism seen in amenorrheic athletes include impaired endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation, which reduces the perfusion of working muscle, impaired skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and vaginal dryness.<ref name=\"Medicine & Science\"/>\n\nDue to low bone mineral density that declines as the number of missed menstrual cycles accumulates, and the loss of BMD may not be fully reversible. Stress fractures occur more commonly in physically active women with menstrual irregularities and/or low BMD with a relative risk for stress fracture two to four times greater in amenorrheic than eumenorrheic athletes. Fractures also occur in the setting of nutritional deficits and low BMD.<ref name=\"Medicine & Science\"/>\n\n==Society and culture==\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the AAFP contend that exercise is important and should be promoted in girls for health and enjoyment; however, pediatricians should be wary of health problems that may occur in female athletes.<ref name=\"Health-Related Concerns\">{{Cite journal|last=Joy|first=Elizabeth|title=Health-Related Concerns of the Female Athlete|journal=American Family Physician|volume=79|issue=6|pages=489\u2013495|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0315/p489.html|accessdate=14 March 2012|date=2009-03-15}}</ref> The health related issues concerning this topic are grave and can lead to numerous health issues as previously demonstrated.

The competitive sports that promote this physical leanness may result in disordered eating and be responsible for the origin of the female athlete triad. For some women, the disorder can have major health consequences.<ref name=\"KidsHealth\">{{cite web|title=Female Athlete Triad|url=http://kidshealth.org/teen/food_fitness/sports/triad.html|publisher=KidsHealth|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref> In addition, for some competitive female athletes, problems such as low self-esteem, a tendency toward perfectionism, and family stress place them at risk for disordered eating.<ref name=\"KidsHealth\"/>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nClinical symptoms of the Triad may include disordered eating, fatigue, hair loss, cold hands and feet, dry skin, noticeable weight loss, increased healing time from injuries (e.g., lingering bruises), increased incidence of bone fracture and cessation of menses.<ref>Eguiguren, M.L. & Ackerman, K.E. (2016). The female athlete triad. In C. Stein, A. Stracciolini, & K. Ackerman (Eds.), ''The young female athlete'' (p. 64). Switzerland, Springer International Publishing.</ref>  Affected athletes may also struggle with low self-esteem and depression.\n\nUpon physical examination, a physician may also note the following symptoms: elevated carotene in the blood, [[anemia]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], electrolyte irregularities, [[hypoestrogenism]], [[Atrophic vaginitis|vaginal atrophy]], and [[bradycardia]].<ref name=\"Nattiv\"/><ref name=\"Hobart\"/>\n\nAn athlete may show signs of restrictive eating, but not meet the clinical criteria for an eating disorder. She may also display subtle menstrual disturbances, such as a change in menstrual cycle length, anovulation, or luteal phase defects, but not yet have developed complete amenorrhea. Likewise, an athlete's bone density may decrease, but may not yet have dropped below her age-matched normal range. These signs can be considered \"occult,\" as no one symptom may be severe enough to seek medical attention, leaving the Triad to go unnoticed or untreated.<ref name=\"What is the Triad\"/>\n\n===Disordered eating===\n{{main|Disordered eating}}\nEnergy availability is defined as energy intake minus energy expended.  Energy is taken in through food consumption.  Our bodies expend energy through normal functioning as well as through exercise.  In the case of female athlete triad, low energy availability may be due to eating disorders, but not necessarily so. Athletes may experience low energy availability by exercising more without a concomitant change in eating habits, or they may increase their energy expenditure while also eating less.<ref name=\"Nattiv\"/> Disordered eating is defined among this situation due to the low caloric intake or low energy availability.\n\nWhile most athletes do not meet the clinical criteria to be diagnosed with an eating disorder such as [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia nervosa]], many will exhibit disordered eating habits such as fasting, as well as avoiding certain types of food the athlete thinks are \"bad\" (such as foods containing fat).<ref name=\"KidsHealth\"/><ref name=\"Hobart\"/> More severe examples of disordered eating habits may include [[binge-eating]]; [[vomiting|purging]]; and the use of diet-pills, [[laxatives]], [[diuretics]], and [[enemas]].<ref name=\"Nattiv\"/>\n\nBy restricting their diet, the athlete may worsen their problem of low energy availability. Having low dietary energy from excessive exercise and/or dietary restrictions leaves too little energy for the body to carry out normal functions such as maintaining a regular menstrual cycle or healthy bone density.<ref name=\"Nattiv\"/>\n\n===Amenorrhea===\n{{main|Amenorrhea|Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea}}\nAmenorrhea, defined as the cessation of a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle for more than three months, is the second disorder in the Triad.  Weight fluctuations from dietary restrictions and/or excessive exercise affect the hypothalamus\u2019s output of gonadotropic hormones.  Gonadotropic hormones \u201cstimulate growth of the gonads and the secretion of sex hormones.\u201d<ref>Online Medical Dictionary. 1997. Center for Cancer Education. <http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?action=Search+OMD&query=gonadotropins> Retrieved on 2007-10-24.</ref>  (e.g. gonadotropin-releasing hormone, lutenizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone.)  These gonadotropic hormones play a role in stimulating estrogen release from the ovaries.  Without estrogen release, the menstrual cycle is disrupted.<ref>Menstruation and the Menstrual Cycle. The National Women\u2019s Health Information Center. 2007. < http://www.4women.gov/FAQ/menstru.htm> Retrieved on 2007-10-19.</ref> Exercising intensely and not eating enough calories can lead to decreases in estrogen, the hormone that helps to regulate the menstrual cycle. As a result, periods may become irregular or stop altogether.<ref name=\"KidsHealth\"/>\n\nThere are two types of amenorrhea.  A woman who has been having her period and then stops menstruating for ninety days or more is said to have secondary amenorrhea. In the case of RED-S, the majority of secondary amenorrhea cases are attributed to [[Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea|Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA),]] an adaptive mechanism to preserve energy for survival and vital processes rather than reproduction when energy balance is low.<ref>Allaway HC, Southmayd EA, De Souza MJ. \"The physiology of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea associated with energy deficiency in exercising women and in women with anorexia nervosa.

Delayed menarche may be associated with delay of the development of secondary sexual characteristics.<ref name=\"Nattiv\"/>\n\n===Osteoporosis===\n{{main|Osteoporosis}}\nOsteoporosis is defined by the National Institutes of Health as \u2018\u2018a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture.\u2019\u2019<ref>Osteoporosis. 2006. National Institutes of Health. <http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Osteoporosis/default.asp> Retrieved on 2007-10-24.</ref> Low estrogen levels and poor nutrition, especially low calcium intake, can lead to osteoporosis, the third aspect of the triad. This condition can ruin a female athlete's career because it may lead to stress fractures and other injuries.<ref name=\"KidsHealth\"/>\n\nPatients with female athlete triad get osteoporosis due to hypoestrogenemia, or low estrogen levels.  With estrogen deficiency, the osteoclasts live longer and are therefore able to resorb more bone. In response to the increased bone resorption, there is increased bone formation and a high-turnover state develops which leads to bone loss and perforation of the trabecular plates.<ref>Ott, Susan. 2007. Estrogen: Mechanism of Bone Action. Department of Medicine University of Washington. < http://courses.washington.edu/bonephys/esteffects.html> Retrieved on 2007-10-24.</ref>  As osteoclasts break down bone, patients see a loss of bone mineral density.  Low bone mineral density renders bones more brittle and hence susceptible to fracture.  Because athletes are active and their bones must endure mechanical stress, the likelihood of experiencing bone fracture is particularly high.<ref name=\"Nattiv\"/>\n\nAdditionally, because those suffering with female athlete triad are also restricting their diet, they may also not be consuming sufficient amounts vitamins and minerals which contribute to bone density; not getting enough [[calcium]] or [[vitamin D]] further exacerbates the problem of weak bones.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/>\n\nBone mass is now thought to peak between the ages of 18-25.  Thus, behaviors which result in low bone density in youth could be detrimental to an athlete\u2019s bone health throughout her lifetime.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/>\n\nIn addition, ovulation is the primary way that females create the hormone progesterone. When an ovum is released from the ovary, the structure that remains develops into the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum emits the hormone progesterone during the 10\u201316 days of the luteal phase. Without experiencing regular, ovulatory menstrual cycles, the female is not secreting the hormone progesterone during the luteal phase of her cycle. Progesterone directly stimulates osteoblasts to make new bone. Therefore if the woman is not ovulating, she is not creating progesterone, and misses out on this opportunity to stimulate new bone growth.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 2968416|year = 2010|last1 = Seifert-Klauss|first1 = V.|title = Progesterone and Bone: Actions Promoting Bone Health in Women|journal = Journal of Osteoporosis|volume = 2010|pages = 1\u201318|last2 = Prior|first2 = J.

Prevention, recognition, and treatment of these clinical conditions should be a priority of those who work with female athletes to ensure that they maximize the benefits of regular exercise.<ref name=\"Medicine & Science\"/>\n\nPatients are recommended to work with a dietician who can monitor their nutritional status and help the patient work towards a healthy goal weight.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> Patients should also meet with a psychiatrist or psychologist to address the psychological aspects of the triad.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> Therefore, it is important that trainers and coaches are made aware of the athlete\u2019s condition and be part of her recovery.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/>\n\n===Medicine===\nPatients are also sometimes treated pharmacologically. To both induce menses and improve bone density, doctors may prescribe cyclic [[estrogen]] or [[progesterone]] as is used to treat post-menopausal women.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> Patients may also be put on oral contraceptives to stimulate regular periods.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> In addition to hormone therapy, nutrition supplements may be recommended.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> Doctors may prescribe calcium supplements.  Vitamin D supplements may be also used because this vitamin aids in calcium absorption.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> [[Bisphosphonates]] and [[calcitonin]], used to treat adults with osteoporosis, may be prescribed, although their effectiveness in adolescents has not yet been established.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/> Finally, if indicated by a psychiatric examination, the affected athlete may be prescribed anti-depressants and in some cases benzodiazepines to help in alleviating severe distress at mealtimes.<ref name=\"Hobart\"/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nSustained low energy availability, with or without disordered eating, can impair health. Psychological problems associated with eating disorders include low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety disorders. Medical complications involve the cardiovascular, endocrine, reproductive, skeletal, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems. The prognosis for anorexia nervosa is grave with a six-fold increase in standard mortality rates compared to the general population. In one study, 5.4% of athletes with eating disorders reported suicide attempts. Although 83% of anorexia nervosa patients partially recover, the rate of sustained recovery of weight, menstrual function and eating behavior is only 33%.<ref name=\"Medicine & Science\"/>\n\nAmenorrheic women can be infertile, due to the absence of ovarian follicular development, ovulation, and luteal function. Consequences of hypoestrogenism seen in amenorrheic athletes include impaired endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation, which reduces the perfusion of working muscle, impaired skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and vaginal dryness.<ref name=\"Medicine & Science\"/>\n\nDue to low bone mineral density that declines as the number of missed menstrual cycles accumulates, and the loss of BMD may not be fully reversible. Stress fractures occur more commonly in physically active women with menstrual irregularities and/or low BMD with a relative risk for stress fracture two to four times greater in amenorrheic than eumenorrheic athletes. Fractures also occur in the setting of nutritional deficits and low BMD.<ref name=\"Medicine & Science\"/>\n\n==Society and culture==\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the AAFP contend that exercise is important and should be promoted in girls for health and enjoyment; however, pediatricians should be wary of health problems that may occur in female athletes.<ref name=\"Health-Related Concerns\">{{Cite journal|last=Joy|first=Elizabeth|title=Health-Related Concerns of the Female Athlete|journal=American Family Physician|volume=79|issue=6|pages=489\u2013495|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0315/p489.html|accessdate=14 March 2012|date=2009-03-15}}</ref> The health related issues concerning this topic are grave and can lead to numerous health issues as previously demonstrated.

The two main classes of sound recording technology are [[analog recording]] and [[digital recording]].\n\nAcoustic analog recording is achieved by a [[microphone diaphragm]] that senses changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] caused by [[acoustics|acoustic]] sound waves and records them as a mechanical representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a [[phonograph]] record (in which a stylus cuts grooves on a record).  In [[magnetic tape]] recording, the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying [[electric current]], which is then converted to a varying [[magnetic field]] by an [[electromagnet]], which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process, with a bigger [[loudspeaker diaphragm]] causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves.\n\nDigital recording and reproduction converts the analog sound signal picked up by the microphone to a [[Digital audio|digital form]] by the process of [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]]. This lets the audio data be stored and [[Data transmission|transmitted]] by a wider variety of media.  Digital recording stores audio as a series of [[binary number]]s (zeros and ones) representing samples of the amplitude of the [[audio signal]] at equal time intervals, at a [[sample rate]] high enough to convey all sounds capable of being [[Hearing (sense)|heard]]. A [[digital audio]] signal must be reconverted to analog form during playback before it is [[power amplifier|amplified]] and connected to a [[loudspeaker]] to produce sound.\n\nPrior to the development of sound recording, there were mechanical systems, such as wind-up [[music box]]es and, later, [[player piano]]s, for encoding and reproducing instrumental music.\n\n==Pre-history==\n[[File:dukirch.gif|thumb|right|170px|Mechanical organ, 1650.]]\n\n{{See also|History of sound recording}}\n\nLong before [[sound]] was first recorded, music was recorded\u2014first by written [[music notation]], then also by mechanical devices (e.g., wind-up [[music box]]es, in which a mechanism turns a spindle, which plucks metal tines, thus reproducing a [[melody]]). Automatic music reproduction traces back as far as the 9th century, when the [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101]] brothers invented the earliest known mechanical musical instrument, in this case, a [[hydropower]]ed (water-powered) [[Organ (music)|organ]] that played interchangeable cylinders. According to Charles B. Fowler, this \"...cylinder with raised pins on the surface remained the basic device to produce and reproduce music mechanically until the second half of the nineteenth century.\" The Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 brothers also invented an automatic [[flute]] player, which appears to have been the first [[programmable machine]].<ref name=\"Fowler 45\u201349\">{{citation|title=The Museum of Music: A History of Mechanical Instruments|first=Charles B.|last=Fowler|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=54|issue=2|date=October 1967|pages=45\u201349|doi=10.2307/3391092|publisher=MENC_ The National Association for Music Education|jstor=3391092}}</ref><ref name=Koetsier>{{cite journal |last1=Koetsier |first1=Teun |year=2001 |title=On the prehistory of programmable machines: musical automata, looms, calculators |journal=Mechanism and Machine Theory |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=589\u2013603 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/S0094-114X(01)00005-2}}</ref>\n\nCarvings in the [[Rosslyn Chapel]] from the 1560s may represent an early attempt to record the [[Chladni patterns]] produced by sound in stone representations, although this theory has not been conclusively proved.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rosslyn Chapel: The Music of the Cubes |last=Mitchell |first=Thomas |year=2006 |publisher=Diversions Books |location= |isbn=0-9554629-0-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Tune into the Da Vinci coda |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/arts/tune_into_the_da_vinci_coda_1_466446 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=26 April 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century, a mechanical bell-ringer controlled by a rotating cylinder was introduced in [[Flanders]].{{cn|date=April 2018}} Similar designs appeared in [[barrel organ]]s (15th century), [[musical clock]]s (1598), [[barrel piano]]s (1805), and [[music box]]es (ca. 1800).

The [[player piano]], first demonstrated in 1876, used a punched paper scroll that could store a long piece of music. The most sophisticated of the piano rolls were hand-played, meaning that the roll represented the actual performance of an individual, not just a transcription of the sheet music. This technology to record a live performance onto a piano roll was not developed until 1904.

Sales of the [[gramophone record]] overtook the cylinder ca. 1910, and by the end of World War I the disc had become the dominant commercial recording format. Edison, who was the main producer of cylinders, created the [[Edison Disc Record]] in an attempt to regain his market. The double-sided 78 rpm shellac disc was the standard consumer music format from the early 1910s to the late 1950s. In various permutations, the audio disc format became the primary medium for consumer sound recordings until the end of the 20th century.\n\nAlthough there was no universally accepted speed, and various companies offered discs that played at several different speeds, the major recording companies eventually settled on a ''de facto'' industry standard of nominally 78 revolutions per minute. The specified speed was 78.26 rpm in America and 77.92 rpm throughout the rest of the world. The difference in speeds was due to the difference in the cycle frequencies of the AC electricity that powered the [[stroboscope]]s used to calibrate recording lathes and turntables.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Copeland|first1=Peter|title=Manual of Analogue Audio Restoration Techniques|date=2008|publisher=The British Library|location=London|pages=89\u201390|url=http://www.bl.uk/britishlibrary/~/media/subjects%20images/sound/analoguesoundrestoration.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref>  The nominal speed of the disc format gave rise to its common nickname, the \"seventy-eight\" (though not until other speeds had become available). Discs were made of shellac or similar brittle plastic-like materials, played with needles made from a variety of materials including mild steel, thorn, and even sapphire. Discs had a distinctly limited playing life that varied depending on how they were manufactured.\n\nEarlier, purely acoustic methods of recording had limited sensitivity and frequency range.  Mid-frequency range notes could be recorded, but very low and very high frequencies could not. Instruments such as the violin were difficult to transfer to disc. One technique to deal with this involved using a [[Stroh violin]] which uses a conical horn connected to a diaphragm that in turn is connected to the violin bridge. The horn was no longer needed once electrical recording was developed.\n\nThe long-playing 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm microgroove [[LP record]], was developed at [[Columbia Records]] and introduced in 1948. The short-playing but convenient {{convert|7|in|cm|adj=on}} 45 rpm microgroove vinyl [[Single (music)|single]] was introduced by [[RCA Victor]] in 1949. In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs by the end of the 1950s, but in some corners of the world, the 78 lingered on far into the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of the several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable. The compact 45 format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as \"unbreakable\". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as \"unbreakable\" compared to wax cylinders.\n\n==Electrical recording==\n[[File:Rca44.png|thumb|RCA-44, a classic [[ribbon microphone]] introduced in 1932. Similar units were widely used for recording and broadcasting in the 1940s and are occasionally still used today.]]\n\nSound recording began as a purely mechanical process. Except for a few crude telephone-based recording devices with no means of amplification, such as the [[telegraphone]],{{efn|The earliest known surviving electrical recording was made on a [[telegraphone]] magnetic recorder at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It includes brief comments by Emperor Franz Joseph and the audio quality, ignoring dropouts and some noise of later origin, is comparable to that of a contemporary telephone.}} it remained so until the 1920s. Between the invention of the phonograph in 1877 and the first commercial [[digital recording]]s in the early 1970s, arguably the most important milestone in the history of sound recording was the introduction of what was then called ''electrical recording'', in which a [[microphone]] was used to convert the sound into an electrical signal that was amplified and used to actuate the recording stylus. This innovation eliminated the \"horn sound\" resonances characteristic of the acoustical process, produced clearer and more full-bodied recordings by greatly extending the useful range of audio frequencies, and allowed previously unrecordable distant and feeble sounds to be captured. During this time, several radio-related developments in [[electronics]] converged to revolutionize the recording process. These included improved microphones and auxiliary devices such as electronic filters, all dependent on electronic [[Amplifier|amplification]] to be of practical use in recording.\n\nIn 1906, [[Lee De Forest]] invented the [[Audion]] [[triode]] vacuum tube, an electronic valve that could amplify weak electrical signals. By 1915, it was in use in long-distance telephone circuits that made conversations between New York and San Francisco practical. Refined versions of this tube were the basis of all electronic sound systems until the commercial introduction of the first [[transistor]]-based audio devices in the mid-1950s.\n\nDuring World War I, engineers in the United States and Great Britain worked on ways to record and reproduce, among other things, the sound of a [[German U-boat]] for training purposes. Acoustical recording methods of the time could not reproduce the sounds accurately. The earliest results were not promising.\n\nThe first electrical recording issued to the public, with little fanfare, was of November 11, 1920 funeral services for [[The Unknown Warrior]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], London. The recording engineers used microphones of the type used in contemporary telephones. Four were discreetly set up in the abbey and wired to recording equipment in a vehicle outside. Although electronic amplification was used, the audio was weak and unclear. The procedure did, however, produce a recording that would otherwise not have been possible in those circumstances. For several years, this little-noted disc remained the only issued electrical recording.\n\nSeveral record companies and independent inventors, notably [[Orlando Marsh]], experimented with equipment and techniques for electrical recording in the early 1920s. Marsh's electrically recorded [[Autograph Records]] were already being sold to the public in 1924, a year before the first such offerings from the major record companies, but their overall sound quality was too low to demonstrate any obvious advantage over traditional acoustical methods. Marsh's microphone technique was idiosyncratic and his work had little if any impact on the systems being developed by others.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.mainspringpress.com/marsh_electric.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230521/http://www.mainspringpress.com/marsh_electric.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |title=When Did Marsh Laboratories Begin to Make Electrical Recordings? |author=Allan Sutton}}</ref>\n\nTelephone industry giant [[Western Electric]] had research laboratories{{efn|In 1925 the laboratories reformed into Bell Telephone Laboratories and under the shared ownership of [[AT&T Corporation|American Telephone & Telegraph Company]] and Western Electric.}} with material and human resources that no record company or independent inventor could match.

They had already patented an electromechanical recorder in 1918, and in the early 1920s, they decided to intensively apply their hardware and expertise to developing two state-of-the-art systems for electronically recording and reproducing sound: one that employed conventional discs and another that recorded optically on motion picture film. Their engineers pioneered the use of mechanical analogs of electrical circuits and developed a superior \"rubber line\" recorder for cutting the groove into the wax master in the disc recording system.<ref>Maxfield, J. P. and H. C. Harrison. Methods of high-quality recording and reproduction of speech based on telephone research. ''Bell System Technical Journal,'' July 1926, 493\u2013523.</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\nBy 1924, such dramatic progress had been made that Western Electric arranged a demonstration for the two leading record companies, the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and the [[Columbia Records|Columbia Phonograph Company]]. Both soon licensed the system and both made their earliest published electrical recordings in February 1925, but neither actually released them until several months later. To avoid making their existing catalogs instantly obsolete, the two long-time archrivals agreed privately not to publicize the new process until November 1925, by which time enough electrically recorded repertory would be available to meet the anticipated demand. During the next few years, the lesser record companies licensed or developed other electrical recording systems. By 1929 only the budget label [[Harmony Records|Harmony]] was still issuing new recordings made by the old acoustical process.\n\nComparison of some surviving Western Electric test recordings with early commercial releases indicates that the record companies \"dumbed down\" the frequency range of the system so the recordings would not overwhelm non-electronic playback equipment, which reproduced very low frequencies as an unpleasant rattle and rapidly wore out discs with strongly recorded high frequencies.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Other recording formats==\nIn the 1920s, [[Phonofilm]] and other early motion picture sound systems employed [[sound-on-film|optical recording]] technology, in which the audio signal was graphically recorded on photographic film. The amplitude variations comprising the signal were used to modulate a light source which was imaged onto the moving film through a narrow slit, allowing the signal to be photographed as variations in the density or width of a \"sound track\". The [[movie projector|projector]] used a steady light and a [[photodetector|photoelectric cell]] to convert these variations back into an electrical signal, which was amplified and sent to [[loudspeaker]]s behind the screen. Ironically, the introduction of \"[[sound film|talkies]]\" was spearheaded by ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), which used the [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] system rather than an optical soundtrack. Optical sound became the standard motion picture audio system throughout the world and remains so for theatrical release prints despite attempts in the 1950s to substitute magnetic soundtracks. Currently, all release prints on [[35 mm movie film]] include an analog optical soundtrack, usually stereo with [[Dolby SR]] noise reduction. In addition, an optically recorded digital soundtrack in Dolby Digital and/or Sony SDDS form is likely to be present. An optically recorded timecode is also commonly included to synchronise CDROMs that contain a DTS soundtrack.\n\nThis period also saw several other historic developments including the introduction of the first practical magnetic sound recording system, the [[Wire recorder|magnetic wire recorder]], which was based on the work of Danish inventor [[Valdemar Poulsen]]. Magnetic wire recorders were effective, but the sound quality was poor, so between the wars, they were primarily used for voice recording and marketed as business dictating machines. In 1924, a German engineer, Kurt Stille, developed the Poulsen wire recorder as a dictating machine.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The following year, [[Ludwig Blattner]] began work that eventually produced the Blattnerphone,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/blattner.htm |title=The Blattnerphone |website=Orbem.co.uk |date=2010-01-10 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}</ref> enhancing it to use steel tape instead of wire. The [[BBC]] started using Blattnerphones in 1930 to record radio programmes. In 1933, radio pioneer [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s company purchased the rights to the Blattnerphone, and newly developed Marconi-Stille recorders were installed in the BBC's [[Maida Vale Studios]] in March 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/ms.htm |title=The Marconi-Stille Recorder - Page 1 |website=Orbem.co.uk |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}</ref> The tape used in Blattnerphones and Marconi-Stille recorders was the same material used to make razor blades, and not surprisingly the fearsome Marconi-Stille recorders were considered so dangerous that technicians had to operate them from another room for safety. Because of the high recording speeds required, they used enormous reels about one metre in diameter, and the thin tape frequently broke, sending jagged lengths of razor steel flying around the studio. The K1 [[Magnetophon]] was the first practical tape recorder, developed by AEG in Germany in 1935.\n\n==Magnetic tape==\n{{Main article|Tape recorder}}\n\n[[File:Magnetic-tape-acetate-vs-polyester-backing.jpg|thumb|Magnetic audio tapes: acetate base (left) and polyester base (right)]]\n\nAn important field of invention during this period was the [[tape recorder]]. [[Magnetic tape]] recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a [[tape head]], which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In playback mode, the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature [[electric generator]] as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Mumma|title=Recording|url=https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/J371600?q=acetate+tape+recording&search=quick&pos=4&_start=1#firsthit|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> The original solid steel ribbon was replaced by a much more practical coated paper tape, but acetate soon replaced paper as the standard tape base. Acetate has fairly low tensile strength and if very thin it will snap easily, so it was in turn eventually superseded by polyester. This technology, the basis for almost all commercial recording from the 1950s to the 1980s, was developed in the 1930s by German audio engineers who also rediscovered the principle of [[AC Bias|AC biasing]] (first used in the 1920s for [[wire recorder]]s), which dramatically improved the frequency response of tape recordings. The technology was further improved just after World War II by American audio engineer [[John T. Mullin]] with backing from [[Bing Crosby]] Enterprises. Mullin's pioneering recorders were modifications of captured German recorders. In the late 1940s, the [[Ampex]] company produced the first tape recorders commercially available in the US.\n\n[[File:Tdkc60cassette.jpg|thumb|A typical Compact Cassette]]\n\nMagnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it.\nWithin a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder\u2014the [[Ampex 200]] model, launched in 1948\u2014American musician-inventor [[Les Paul]] had invented the first [[multitrack tape recorder]], ushering in another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the [[Musique Concr\u00e8te]] school and avant garde composers like [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], which in turn led to the innovative pop music recordings of artists such as [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Beatles]], and [[The Beach Boys]].\n\nThe ease and accuracy of tape editing, as compared to the cumbersome disc-to-disc editing procedures previously in some limited use, together with tape's consistently high audio quality finally convinced radio networks to routinely prerecord their entertainment programming, most of which had formerly been broadcast live. Also, for the first time, broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties were able to undertake comprehensive audio logging of each day's radio broadcasts. Innovations like multitracking and [[Delay (audio effect)|tape echo]] allowed radio programs and advertisements to be produced to a high level of complexity and sophistication. The combined impact with innovations such as the endless loop [[broadcast cartridge]] led to significant changes in the pacing and production style of radio program content and advertising.\n\n==Stereo and hi-fi==\n{{See also|Stereophonic sound|High fidelity}}\n\nIn 1881, it was noted during experiments in transmitting sound from the Paris Opera that it was possible to follow the movement of singers on the stage if earpieces connected to different microphones were held to the two ears.  This discovery was commercialized in 1890 with the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2trophone]] system, which operated for over forty years until 1932. In 1931, [[Alan Blumlein]], a British electronics engineer working for [[EMI]], designed a way to make the sound of an actor in a film follow his movement across the screen. In December 1931, he submitted a patent including the idea, and in 1933 this became UK patent number 394,325.<ref>{{Cite patent\n | country = GB\n | number = 394325\n | title = Improvements in and relating to Sound-transmission, Sound-recording and Sound-reproducing Systems.\n | status = patent\n | gdate = 1933-06-14\n | fdate = 1931-12-14\n | pridate = 1932-11-10\n | inventor = Alan Dower Blumlein\n | invent1 = Blumlein, Alan Dower\n | assign1 = Alan Dower Blumlein\n | assign2 = Musical Industries, Limited\n | class = H04R1/40B; H04R11/12; H04R9/16; H04S1/00\n}}</ref> Over the next two years, Blumlein developed stereo microphones and a stereo disc-cutting head, and recorded a number of short films with stereo soundtracks.\n\nIn the 1930s, experiments with magnetic tape enabled the development of the first practical commercial sound systems that could record and reproduce high-fidelity [[stereophonic sound]]. The experiments with stereo during the 1930s and 1940s were hampered by problems with synchronization. A major breakthrough in practical stereo sound was made by [[Bell Laboratories]], who in 1937 demonstrated a practical system of two-channel stereo, using dual optical sound tracks on film. Major movie studios quickly developed three-track and four-track sound systems, and the first stereo sound recording for a commercial film was made by [[Judy Garland]] for the [[MGM]] movie ''[[Listen, Darling]]'' in 1938. The first commercially released movie with a stereo soundtrack was Walt Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', released in 1940.  The 1941 release of Fantasia used the \"[[Fantasound]]\" sound system. This system used a separate film for the sound, synchronized with the film carrying the picture. The sound film had four double-width optical soundtracks, three for left, center, and right audio\u2014and a fourth as a \"control\" track with three recorded tones that controlled the playback volume of the three audio channels. Because of the complex equipment this system required, Disney exhibited the movie as a roadshow, and only in the United States.  Regular releases of the movie used standard mono optical 35&nbsp;mm stock until 1956, when Disney released the film with a stereo soundtrack that used the \"[[Cinemascope]]\" four-track magnetic sound system.\n\nGerman audio engineers working on magnetic tape developed stereo recording by 1941, even though a 2-track push-pull monaural technique existed in 1939. Of 250 stereophonic recordings made during WW2, only three survive: Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto with Walter Gieseking and Arthur Rother, a Brahms Serenade, and the last movement of Bruckner's 8th Symphony with Von Karajan. The [[Audio Engineering Society]] has issued all these recordings on [[compact disk|CD]]. ([[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] had released the Beethoven Concerto on LP, and it has been reissued on CD several times since).  Other early German stereophonic tapes are believed to have been destroyed in bombings. Not until [[Ampex]] introduced the first commercial two-track tape recorders in the late 1940s did stereo tape recording become commercially feasible. However, despite the availability of multitrack tape, stereo did not become the standard system for commercial music recording for some years, and remained a specialist market during the 1950s. EMI (UK) was the first company to release commercial stereophonic tapes. They issued their first ''Stereosonic'' tape in 1954. Others quickly followed, under the His Master's Voice and Columbia labels.  161 Stereosonic tapes were released, mostly classical music or lyric recordings. RCA imported these tapes into the USA.\n\nTwo-track stereophonic tapes were more successful in America during the second half of the 1950s.  They were duplicated at real time (1:1) or at twice the normal speed (2:1) when later 4-track tapes were often duplicated at up to 16 times the normal speed, providing a lower sound quality in many cases.  Early American 2-track stereophonic tapes were very expensive.  A typical example is the price list of the Sonotape/Westminster reels:  $6.95, $11.95 and $17.95 for the 7000, 9000 and 8000 series respectively.  Some HMV tapes released in the USA also cost up to $15. The history of stereo recording changed after the late 1957 introduction of the ''Westrex stereo phonograph disc'', which used the groove format developed earlier by Blumlein. [[Decca Records]] in England came out with [[FFRR technique|FFRR]] (Full Frequency Range Recording) in the 1940s, which became internationally accepted as a worldwide standard for higher quality recording on vinyl records. The [[Ernest Ansermet]] recording of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s [[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]] was key in the development of full frequency range records and alerting the listening public to high fidelity in 1946.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vinylrecordscollector.co.uk/text/vinylhist14a.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020621034232/http://www.vinylrecordscollector.co.uk/text/vinylhist14a.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-06-21 |title=Decca's (ffrr) Frequency Series - History Of Vinyl 1 |website=Vinylrecordscollector.co.uk |accessdate=2017-05-24 }}</ref>\n\nRecord companies mixed most popular music singles into monophonic sound until the mid-1960s\u2014then commonly released major recordings in both mono and stereo until the early 1970s. Many 1960s pop albums available only in stereo in the 2000s were originally released only in mono, and record companies produced the \"stereo\" versions of these albums by simply separating the two tracks of the master tape, creating \"pseudo stereo\". In the mid Sixties, as stereo became more popular, many mono recordings (such as The Beach Boys' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'') were remastered using the so-called \"[[Stereophonic sound#Pseudo-stereo|fake stereo]]\" method, which spread the sound across the stereo field by directing higher-frequency sound into one channel and lower-frequency sounds into the other.\n\n==1950s to 1980s==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}\n\nMagnetic tape transformed the recording industry. By the early 1950s, most commercial recordings were mastered on tape instead of recorded directly to disc. Tape facilitated a degree of manipulation in the recording process that was impractical with mixes and multiple generations of directly recorded discs. An early example is [[Les Paul]]'s 1951 recording of ''[[How High the Moon]]'', on which Paul played eight overdubbed guitar tracks. In the 1960s [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]], [[Frank Zappa]], and [[The Beatles]] (with producer [[George Martin]]) were among the first popular artists to explore the possibilities of [[multitrack recording]] techniques and effects on their landmark albums ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', ''[[Freak Out!]]'', and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.\n\nThe next important innovation was small cartridge-based tape systems, of which the [[compact cassette]], commercialized by the [[Philips]] electronics company in 1964, is the best known. Initially a low-fidelity format for spoken-word voice recording and inadequate for music reproduction, after a series of improvements it entirely replaced the competing formats: the larger [[8-track tape]] (used primarily in cars) and the fairly similar \"Deutsche Cassette\" developed by the German company Grundig. This latter system was not particularly common in Europe and practically unheard-of in America. The compact cassette became a major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]], a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979. The Walkman was the first personal music player and it gave a major boost to sales of prerecorded cassettes, which became the first widely successful release format that used a re-recordable medium: the vinyl<!-- avoids BE/AE differences --> record was a playback-only medium and commercially prerecorded tapes for [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape decks]], which many consumers found difficult to operate, were never more than an uncommon niche market item.\n\nA key advance in audio fidelity came with the [[Dolby A]] noise reduction system, invented by [[Ray Dolby]] and introduced into professional recording studios in 1966. It suppressed the light but sometimes quite noticeable steady background of hiss, which was the only easily audible downside of mastering on tape instead of recording directly to disc. A competing system, [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]], invented by David Blackmer, also found success in professional audio. A simpler variant of Dolby's noise reduction system, known as Dolby B, greatly improved the sound of cassette tape recordings by reducing the especially high level of hiss that resulted from the cassette's miniaturized tape format. It, and variants, also eventually found wide application in the recording and film industries. Dolby B was crucial to the popularization<!-- AE appears to be the established variant in this article --> and commercial success of the cassette as a domestic recording and playback medium, and it became a standard feature in the booming home and car stereo market of the 1970s and beyond. The compact cassette format also benefited enormously from improvements to the tape itself as coatings with wider frequency responses and lower inherent noise were developed, often based on cobalt and chrome oxides as the magnetic material instead of the more usual iron oxide.\n\nThe multitrack audio cartridge had been in wide use in the radio industry, from the late 1950s to the 1980s, but in the 1960s the pre-recorded [[8-track cartridge]] was launched as a consumer audio format by [[Bill Lear]] of the Lear Jet aircraft company (and although its correct name was the 'Lear Jet Cartridge', it was seldom referred to as such). Aimed particularly at the automotive market, they were the first practical, affordable car hi-fi systems, and could produce sound quality superior to that of the compact cassette. However the smaller size and greater durability \u2014 augmented by the ability to create home-recorded music \"compilations\" since 8-track recorders were rare \u2014 saw the cassette become the dominant consumer format for portable audio devices in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThere had been experiments with multi-channel sound for many years \u2014 usually for special musical or cultural events \u2014 but the first commercial application of the concept came in the early 1970s with the introduction of [[Quadraphonic]] sound. This spin-off development from multitrack recording used four tracks (instead of the two used in stereo) and four speakers to create a 360-degree audio field around the listener. Following the release of the first consumer 4-channel [[hi-fi]] systems, a number of popular albums were released in one of the competing four-channel formats; among the best known are [[Mike Oldfield]]'s ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''. Quadraphonic sound was not a commercial success, partly because of competing and somewhat incompatible four-channel sound systems (e.g., [[CBS]], [[JVC]], [[Dynaco]] and others all had systems) and generally poor quality, even when played as intended on the correct equipment, of the released music. It eventually faded out in the late 1970s, although this early venture paved the way for the eventual introduction of domestic [[Surround Sound]] systems in home theatre use, which have gained enormous popularity since the introduction of the DVD. This widespread adoption has occurred despite the confusion introduced by the multitude of available surround sound standards.\n\n==Audio components==\n{{main article|High fidelity#Modularity}}\nThe replacement of the relatively fragile thermionic valve ([[vacuum tube]]) by the smaller, lighter-weight, cooler-running, less expensive, more robust, and less power-hungry [[transistor]] also accelerated the sale of consumer high-fidelity \"[[hi-fi]]\" sound systems from the 1960s onward. In the 1950s, most record players were monophonic and had relatively low sound quality. Few consumers could afford high-quality stereophonic sound systems. In the 1960s, American manufacturers introduced a new generation of \"modular\" hi-fi components \u2014 separate turntables, pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, both combined as integrated amplifiers, tape recorders, and other ancillary equipment like the [[graphic equaliser]], which could be connected together to create a complete home sound system. These developments were rapidly taken up by major Japanese electronics companies, which soon flooded the world market with relatively affordable, high-quality transistorized audio components. By the 1980s, corporations like [[Sony]] had become world leaders in the music recording and playback industry.\n\n==Digital recording==\n{{Main article|Digital recording}}\n{{See also|Pulse code modulation|Digital audio|Hard disk recorder|Digital audio workstation}}\n[[File:Pcm.svg|thumb|left|150px|Graphical representation of a sound wave in analog (red) and 4-bit digital (blue).]]\n\nThe advent of [[digital recording|digital sound recording]] and later the [[compact disc]] (CD) in 1982 brought significant improvements in the durability of consumer recordings. The CD initiated another massive wave of change in the consumer music industry, with [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]] effectively relegated to a small niche market by the mid-1990s. However, the record industry fiercely resisted the introduction of digital systems, fearing wholesale piracy on a medium able to produce perfect copies of original released recordings. However, the industry succumbed to the inevitable, though using various protection system (principally [[Serial Copy Management System]], or SCMS).\n[[File:Sony-pcm-m10.jpg|right|thumb| A digital sound recorder from Sony]]\n\nThe most recent and revolutionary developments have been in digital recording, with the development of various uncompressed and compressed digital [[audio file format]]s, [[Microprocessor|processors]] capable and fast enough to convert the digital data to sound in [[Real-time computing|real time]], and inexpensive [[mass storage]]<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society\n|volume=47\n|date=March 1991\n|title=The future of digital audio recording\n|author=Kees Schouhamer Immink\n|authorlink=Kees Schouhamer Immink\n|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322974158\n|pages=171\u2013172\n|quote=Keynote address was presented to the 104th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society in Amsterdam during the society's golden anniversary celebration on May 17, 1998.}}</ref>\n.

Digital audio technology is now used in all areas of audio, from casual use of music files of moderate quality to the most demanding professional applications.

[[Digital dictation]] software for recording and transcribing speech has different requirements; intelligibility and flexible playback facilities are priorities, while a wide frequency range and high audio quality are not.\n\n==Cultural effects==\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo briefs the traveling press (42895283735).jpg|thumb|Many members of the media use recorders to capture remarks]]\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=April 2017}}\nThe development of analog sound recording in the nineteenth century and its widespread use throughout the twentieth century had a huge impact on the development of music. Before analog sound recording was invented, most music was listened to by hearing a live performance, or by singing or playing a song or piece. Throughout the [[Medieval music|medieval]], [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], [[Baroque music|Baroque]], [[Classical music (period)|Classical]], and through much of the [[Romantic music era]], the main way that songs and instrumental pieces were \"recorded\" was by notating the piece in [[music notation]]. While music notation indicates the pitches of the melody and their rhythm, the notation is not like a 2010-era sound recording. Indeed, in the Medieval era, [[Gregorian chant]] did not indicate the rhythm of the chant. In the Baroque era, instrumental pieces often lack a tempo indication and usually none of the ornaments were written down. As a result, each performance of a song or piece would be slightly different.\n\nWith the development of analog sound recording, though, a performance could be permanently fixed, in all of its elements: pitch, rhythm, timbre, ornaments and expression. This meant that many more elements of a performance would be captured and disseminated to other listeners. The development of sound recording also enabled a much larger proportion of people to hear famous orchestras, operas, singers and bands, because even if a non-wealthy person could not afford to hear the live concert, she or he might be able to afford to buy the recording. The availability of sound recording thus helped to spread musical styles to new regions, countries and continents. The cultural influence went in a number of directions. Sound recordings enabled Western music lovers to hear actual recordings of Asian, Middle Eastern and African groups and performers, increasing awareness of non-Western musical styles. At the same time, sound recordings enabled non-Western music lovers to hear the most famous North American and European groups and singers.\n\n==Legal status==\n\nIn copyright law, a \"phonogram\" or \"sound recording\" is a work that results from the fixation of sounds in a medium. The notice of copyright in a phonogram uses the [[sound recording copyright symbol]], which the [[Geneva Phonograms Convention]] defines as \u2117 (the letter P in a full circle).

The two main classes of sound recording technology are [[analog recording]] and [[digital recording]].\n\nAcoustic analog recording is achieved by a [[microphone diaphragm]] that senses changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] caused by [[acoustics|acoustic]] sound waves and records them as a mechanical representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a [[phonograph]] record (in which a stylus cuts grooves on a record).  In [[magnetic tape]] recording, the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying [[electric current]], which is then converted to a varying [[magnetic field]] by an [[electromagnet]], which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process, with a bigger [[loudspeaker diaphragm]] causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves.\n\nDigital recording and reproduction converts the analog sound signal picked up by the microphone to a [[Digital audio|digital form]] by the process of [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]]. This lets the audio data be stored and [[Data transmission|transmitted]] by a wider variety of media.  Digital recording stores audio as a series of [[binary number]]s (zeros and ones) representing samples of the amplitude of the [[audio signal]] at equal time intervals, at a [[sample rate]] high enough to convey all sounds capable of being [[Hearing (sense)|heard]]. A [[digital audio]] signal must be reconverted to analog form during playback before it is [[power amplifier|amplified]] and connected to a [[loudspeaker]] to produce sound.\n\nPrior to the development of sound recording, there were mechanical systems, such as wind-up [[music box]]es and, later, [[player piano]]s, for encoding and reproducing instrumental music.\n\n==Pre-history==\n[[File:dukirch.gif|thumb|right|170px|Mechanical organ, 1650.]]\n\n{{See also|History of sound recording}}\n\nLong before [[sound]] was first recorded, music was recorded\u2014first by written [[music notation]], then also by mechanical devices (e.g., wind-up [[music box]]es, in which a mechanism turns a spindle, which plucks metal tines, thus reproducing a [[melody]]). Automatic music reproduction traces back as far as the 9th century, when the [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101]] brothers invented the earliest known mechanical musical instrument, in this case, a [[hydropower]]ed (water-powered) [[Organ (music)|organ]] that played interchangeable cylinders. According to Charles B. Fowler, this \"...cylinder with raised pins on the surface remained the basic device to produce and reproduce music mechanically until the second half of the nineteenth century.\" The Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 brothers also invented an automatic [[flute]] player, which appears to have been the first [[programmable machine]].<ref name=\"Fowler 45\u201349\">{{citation|title=The Museum of Music: A History of Mechanical Instruments|first=Charles B.|last=Fowler|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=54|issue=2|date=October 1967|pages=45\u201349|doi=10.2307/3391092|publisher=MENC_ The National Association for Music Education|jstor=3391092}}</ref><ref name=Koetsier>{{cite journal |last1=Koetsier |first1=Teun |year=2001 |title=On the prehistory of programmable machines: musical automata, looms, calculators |journal=Mechanism and Machine Theory |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=589\u2013603 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/S0094-114X(01)00005-2}}</ref>\n\nCarvings in the [[Rosslyn Chapel]] from the 1560s may represent an early attempt to record the [[Chladni patterns]] produced by sound in stone representations, although this theory has not been conclusively proved.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rosslyn Chapel: The Music of the Cubes |last=Mitchell |first=Thomas |year=2006 |publisher=Diversions Books |location= |isbn=0-9554629-0-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Tune into the Da Vinci coda |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/arts/tune_into_the_da_vinci_coda_1_466446 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=26 April 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century, a mechanical bell-ringer controlled by a rotating cylinder was introduced in [[Flanders]].{{cn|date=April 2018}} Similar designs appeared in [[barrel organ]]s (15th century), [[musical clock]]s (1598), [[barrel piano]]s (1805), and [[music box]]es (ca. 1800). A music box is an automatic [[musical instrument]] that produces sounds by the use of a set of pins placed on a revolving cylinder or disc so as to pluck the tuned teeth (or [[Lamellophone|''lamellae'']]) of a steel comb.\n\nThe [[fairground organ]], developed in 1892, used a system of accordion-folded punched cardboard books. The [[player piano]], first demonstrated in 1876, used a punched paper scroll that could store a long piece of music. The most sophisticated of the piano rolls were hand-played, meaning that the roll represented the actual performance of an individual, not just a transcription of the sheet music. This technology to record a live performance onto a piano roll was not developed until 1904. Piano rolls were in continuous mass production from 1896 to 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pianola.org/history/history_pianoplayers.cfm|title=The Pianola Institute - History of the Pianola - Piano Players|website=Pianola.org|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/incoming/article134934.ece|title=The day the music died - News - The Buffalo News|date=June 10, 2011|accessdate=May 24, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610220347/http://www.buffalonews.com/incoming/article134934.ece|archivedate=June 10, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> A 1908 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] copyright case noted that, in 1902 alone, there were between 70,000 and 75,000 player pianos manufactured, and between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 piano rolls produced.<ref>''[[White-Smith Music Publishing Company v.

Sales of the [[gramophone record]] overtook the cylinder ca. 1910, and by the end of World War I the disc had become the dominant commercial recording format. Edison, who was the main producer of cylinders, created the [[Edison Disc Record]] in an attempt to regain his market. The double-sided 78 rpm shellac disc was the standard consumer music format from the early 1910s to the late 1950s. In various permutations, the audio disc format became the primary medium for consumer sound recordings until the end of the 20th century.\n\nAlthough there was no universally accepted speed, and various companies offered discs that played at several different speeds, the major recording companies eventually settled on a ''de facto'' industry standard of nominally 78 revolutions per minute. The specified speed was 78.26 rpm in America and 77.92 rpm throughout the rest of the world. The difference in speeds was due to the difference in the cycle frequencies of the AC electricity that powered the [[stroboscope]]s used to calibrate recording lathes and turntables.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Copeland|first1=Peter|title=Manual of Analogue Audio Restoration Techniques|date=2008|publisher=The British Library|location=London|pages=89\u201390|url=http://www.bl.uk/britishlibrary/~/media/subjects%20images/sound/analoguesoundrestoration.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref>  The nominal speed of the disc format gave rise to its common nickname, the \"seventy-eight\" (though not until other speeds had become available). Discs were made of shellac or similar brittle plastic-like materials, played with needles made from a variety of materials including mild steel, thorn, and even sapphire. Discs had a distinctly limited playing life that varied depending on how they were manufactured.\n\nEarlier, purely acoustic methods of recording had limited sensitivity and frequency range.  Mid-frequency range notes could be recorded, but very low and very high frequencies could not. Instruments such as the violin were difficult to transfer to disc. One technique to deal with this involved using a [[Stroh violin]] which uses a conical horn connected to a diaphragm that in turn is connected to the violin bridge. The horn was no longer needed once electrical recording was developed.\n\nThe long-playing 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm microgroove [[LP record]], was developed at [[Columbia Records]] and introduced in 1948. The short-playing but convenient {{convert|7|in|cm|adj=on}} 45 rpm microgroove vinyl [[Single (music)|single]] was introduced by [[RCA Victor]] in 1949. In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs by the end of the 1950s, but in some corners of the world, the 78 lingered on far into the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of the several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable. The compact 45 format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as \"unbreakable\". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as \"unbreakable\" compared to wax cylinders.\n\n==Electrical recording==\n[[File:Rca44.png|thumb|RCA-44, a classic [[ribbon microphone]] introduced in 1932. Similar units were widely used for recording and broadcasting in the 1940s and are occasionally still used today.]]\n\nSound recording began as a purely mechanical process. Except for a few crude telephone-based recording devices with no means of amplification, such as the [[telegraphone]],{{efn|The earliest known surviving electrical recording was made on a [[telegraphone]] magnetic recorder at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It includes brief comments by Emperor Franz Joseph and the audio quality, ignoring dropouts and some noise of later origin, is comparable to that of a contemporary telephone.}} it remained so until the 1920s. Between the invention of the phonograph in 1877 and the first commercial [[digital recording]]s in the early 1970s, arguably the most important milestone in the history of sound recording was the introduction of what was then called ''electrical recording'', in which a [[microphone]] was used to convert the sound into an electrical signal that was amplified and used to actuate the recording stylus. This innovation eliminated the \"horn sound\" resonances characteristic of the acoustical process, produced clearer and more full-bodied recordings by greatly extending the useful range of audio frequencies, and allowed previously unrecordable distant and feeble sounds to be captured. During this time, several radio-related developments in [[electronics]] converged to revolutionize the recording process. These included improved microphones and auxiliary devices such as electronic filters, all dependent on electronic [[Amplifier|amplification]] to be of practical use in recording.\n\nIn 1906, [[Lee De Forest]] invented the [[Audion]] [[triode]] vacuum tube, an electronic valve that could amplify weak electrical signals. By 1915, it was in use in long-distance telephone circuits that made conversations between New York and San Francisco practical. Refined versions of this tube were the basis of all electronic sound systems until the commercial introduction of the first [[transistor]]-based audio devices in the mid-1950s.\n\nDuring World War I, engineers in the United States and Great Britain worked on ways to record and reproduce, among other things, the sound of a [[German U-boat]] for training purposes. Acoustical recording methods of the time could not reproduce the sounds accurately. The earliest results were not promising.\n\nThe first electrical recording issued to the public, with little fanfare, was of November 11, 1920 funeral services for [[The Unknown Warrior]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], London. The recording engineers used microphones of the type used in contemporary telephones. Four were discreetly set up in the abbey and wired to recording equipment in a vehicle outside. Although electronic amplification was used, the audio was weak and unclear. The procedure did, however, produce a recording that would otherwise not have been possible in those circumstances. For several years, this little-noted disc remained the only issued electrical recording.\n\nSeveral record companies and independent inventors, notably [[Orlando Marsh]], experimented with equipment and techniques for electrical recording in the early 1920s. Marsh's electrically recorded [[Autograph Records]] were already being sold to the public in 1924, a year before the first such offerings from the major record companies, but their overall sound quality was too low to demonstrate any obvious advantage over traditional acoustical methods. Marsh's microphone technique was idiosyncratic and his work had little if any impact on the systems being developed by others.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.mainspringpress.com/marsh_electric.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230521/http://www.mainspringpress.com/marsh_electric.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |title=When Did Marsh Laboratories Begin to Make Electrical Recordings? |author=Allan Sutton}}</ref>\n\nTelephone industry giant [[Western Electric]] had research laboratories{{efn|In 1925 the laboratories reformed into Bell Telephone Laboratories and under the shared ownership of [[AT&T Corporation|American Telephone & Telegraph Company]] and Western Electric.}} with material and human resources that no record company or independent inventor could match.

They had already patented an electromechanical recorder in 1918, and in the early 1920s, they decided to intensively apply their hardware and expertise to developing two state-of-the-art systems for electronically recording and reproducing sound: one that employed conventional discs and another that recorded optically on motion picture film. Their engineers pioneered the use of mechanical analogs of electrical circuits and developed a superior \"rubber line\" recorder for cutting the groove into the wax master in the disc recording system.<ref>Maxfield, J. P. and H. C. Harrison. Methods of high-quality recording and reproduction of speech based on telephone research. ''Bell System Technical Journal,'' July 1926, 493\u2013523.</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\nBy 1924, such dramatic progress had been made that Western Electric arranged a demonstration for the two leading record companies, the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and the [[Columbia Records|Columbia Phonograph Company]]. Both soon licensed the system and both made their earliest published electrical recordings in February 1925, but neither actually released them until several months later. To avoid making their existing catalogs instantly obsolete, the two long-time archrivals agreed privately not to publicize the new process until November 1925, by which time enough electrically recorded repertory would be available to meet the anticipated demand. During the next few years, the lesser record companies licensed or developed other electrical recording systems. By 1929 only the budget label [[Harmony Records|Harmony]] was still issuing new recordings made by the old acoustical process.\n\nComparison of some surviving Western Electric test recordings with early commercial releases indicates that the record companies \"dumbed down\" the frequency range of the system so the recordings would not overwhelm non-electronic playback equipment, which reproduced very low frequencies as an unpleasant rattle and rapidly wore out discs with strongly recorded high frequencies.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Other recording formats==\nIn the 1920s, [[Phonofilm]] and other early motion picture sound systems employed [[sound-on-film|optical recording]] technology, in which the audio signal was graphically recorded on photographic film. The amplitude variations comprising the signal were used to modulate a light source which was imaged onto the moving film through a narrow slit, allowing the signal to be photographed as variations in the density or width of a \"sound track\". The [[movie projector|projector]] used a steady light and a [[photodetector|photoelectric cell]] to convert these variations back into an electrical signal, which was amplified and sent to [[loudspeaker]]s behind the screen. Ironically, the introduction of \"[[sound film|talkies]]\" was spearheaded by ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), which used the [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] system rather than an optical soundtrack. Optical sound became the standard motion picture audio system throughout the world and remains so for theatrical release prints despite attempts in the 1950s to substitute magnetic soundtracks. Currently, all release prints on [[35 mm movie film]] include an analog optical soundtrack, usually stereo with [[Dolby SR]] noise reduction. In addition, an optically recorded digital soundtrack in Dolby Digital and/or Sony SDDS form is likely to be present. An optically recorded timecode is also commonly included to synchronise CDROMs that contain a DTS soundtrack.\n\nThis period also saw several other historic developments including the introduction of the first practical magnetic sound recording system, the [[Wire recorder|magnetic wire recorder]], which was based on the work of Danish inventor [[Valdemar Poulsen]]. Magnetic wire recorders were effective, but the sound quality was poor, so between the wars, they were primarily used for voice recording and marketed as business dictating machines. In 1924, a German engineer, Kurt Stille, developed the Poulsen wire recorder as a dictating machine.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The following year, [[Ludwig Blattner]] began work that eventually produced the Blattnerphone,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/blattner.htm |title=The Blattnerphone |website=Orbem.co.uk |date=2010-01-10 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}</ref> enhancing it to use steel tape instead of wire. The [[BBC]] started using Blattnerphones in 1930 to record radio programmes. In 1933, radio pioneer [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s company purchased the rights to the Blattnerphone, and newly developed Marconi-Stille recorders were installed in the BBC's [[Maida Vale Studios]] in March 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/ms.htm |title=The Marconi-Stille Recorder - Page 1 |website=Orbem.co.uk |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}</ref> The tape used in Blattnerphones and Marconi-Stille recorders was the same material used to make razor blades, and not surprisingly the fearsome Marconi-Stille recorders were considered so dangerous that technicians had to operate them from another room for safety. Because of the high recording speeds required, they used enormous reels about one metre in diameter, and the thin tape frequently broke, sending jagged lengths of razor steel flying around the studio. The K1 [[Magnetophon]] was the first practical tape recorder, developed by AEG in Germany in 1935.\n\n==Magnetic tape==\n{{Main article|Tape recorder}}\n\n[[File:Magnetic-tape-acetate-vs-polyester-backing.jpg|thumb|Magnetic audio tapes: acetate base (left) and polyester base (right)]]\n\nAn important field of invention during this period was the [[tape recorder]]. [[Magnetic tape]] recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a [[tape head]], which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In playback mode, the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature [[electric generator]] as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Mumma|title=Recording|url=https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/J371600?q=acetate+tape+recording&search=quick&pos=4&_start=1#firsthit|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> The original solid steel ribbon was replaced by a much more practical coated paper tape, but acetate soon replaced paper as the standard tape base. Acetate has fairly low tensile strength and if very thin it will snap easily, so it was in turn eventually superseded by polyester. This technology, the basis for almost all commercial recording from the 1950s to the 1980s, was developed in the 1930s by German audio engineers who also rediscovered the principle of [[AC Bias|AC biasing]] (first used in the 1920s for [[wire recorder]]s), which dramatically improved the frequency response of tape recordings. The technology was further improved just after World War II by American audio engineer [[John T. Mullin]] with backing from [[Bing Crosby]] Enterprises. Mullin's pioneering recorders were modifications of captured German recorders. In the late 1940s, the [[Ampex]] company produced the first tape recorders commercially available in the US.\n\n[[File:Tdkc60cassette.jpg|thumb|A typical Compact Cassette]]\n\nMagnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it.\nWithin a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder\u2014the [[Ampex 200]] model, launched in 1948\u2014American musician-inventor [[Les Paul]] had invented the first [[multitrack tape recorder]], ushering in another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the [[Musique Concr\u00e8te]] school and avant garde composers like [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], which in turn led to the innovative pop music recordings of artists such as [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Beatles]], and [[The Beach Boys]].\n\nThe ease and accuracy of tape editing, as compared to the cumbersome disc-to-disc editing procedures previously in some limited use, together with tape's consistently high audio quality finally convinced radio networks to routinely prerecord their entertainment programming, most of which had formerly been broadcast live. Also, for the first time, broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties were able to undertake comprehensive audio logging of each day's radio broadcasts. Innovations like multitracking and [[Delay (audio effect)|tape echo]] allowed radio programs and advertisements to be produced to a high level of complexity and sophistication. The combined impact with innovations such as the endless loop [[broadcast cartridge]] led to significant changes in the pacing and production style of radio program content and advertising.\n\n==Stereo and hi-fi==\n{{See also|Stereophonic sound|High fidelity}}\n\nIn 1881, it was noted during experiments in transmitting sound from the Paris Opera that it was possible to follow the movement of singers on the stage if earpieces connected to different microphones were held to the two ears.  This discovery was commercialized in 1890 with the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2trophone]] system, which operated for over forty years until 1932. In 1931, [[Alan Blumlein]], a British electronics engineer working for [[EMI]], designed a way to make the sound of an actor in a film follow his movement across the screen. In December 1931, he submitted a patent including the idea, and in 1933 this became UK patent number 394,325.<ref>{{Cite patent\n | country = GB\n | number = 394325\n | title = Improvements in and relating to Sound-transmission, Sound-recording and Sound-reproducing Systems.\n | status = patent\n | gdate = 1933-06-14\n | fdate = 1931-12-14\n | pridate = 1932-11-10\n | inventor = Alan Dower Blumlein\n | invent1 = Blumlein, Alan Dower\n | assign1 = Alan Dower Blumlein\n | assign2 = Musical Industries, Limited\n | class = H04R1/40B; H04R11/12; H04R9/16; H04S1/00\n}}</ref> Over the next two years, Blumlein developed stereo microphones and a stereo disc-cutting head, and recorded a number of short films with stereo soundtracks.\n\nIn the 1930s, experiments with magnetic tape enabled the development of the first practical commercial sound systems that could record and reproduce high-fidelity [[stereophonic sound]]. The experiments with stereo during the 1930s and 1940s were hampered by problems with synchronization. A major breakthrough in practical stereo sound was made by [[Bell Laboratories]], who in 1937 demonstrated a practical system of two-channel stereo, using dual optical sound tracks on film. Major movie studios quickly developed three-track and four-track sound systems, and the first stereo sound recording for a commercial film was made by [[Judy Garland]] for the [[MGM]] movie ''[[Listen, Darling]]'' in 1938. The first commercially released movie with a stereo soundtrack was Walt Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', released in 1940.  The 1941 release of Fantasia used the \"[[Fantasound]]\" sound system. This system used a separate film for the sound, synchronized with the film carrying the picture. The sound film had four double-width optical soundtracks, three for left, center, and right audio\u2014and a fourth as a \"control\" track with three recorded tones that controlled the playback volume of the three audio channels. Because of the complex equipment this system required, Disney exhibited the movie as a roadshow, and only in the United States.  Regular releases of the movie used standard mono optical 35&nbsp;mm stock until 1956, when Disney released the film with a stereo soundtrack that used the \"[[Cinemascope]]\" four-track magnetic sound system.\n\nGerman audio engineers working on magnetic tape developed stereo recording by 1941, even though a 2-track push-pull monaural technique existed in 1939. Of 250 stereophonic recordings made during WW2, only three survive: Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto with Walter Gieseking and Arthur Rother, a Brahms Serenade, and the last movement of Bruckner's 8th Symphony with Von Karajan. The [[Audio Engineering Society]] has issued all these recordings on [[compact disk|CD]]. ([[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] had released the Beethoven Concerto on LP, and it has been reissued on CD several times since).  Other early German stereophonic tapes are believed to have been destroyed in bombings. Not until [[Ampex]] introduced the first commercial two-track tape recorders in the late 1940s did stereo tape recording become commercially feasible. However, despite the availability of multitrack tape, stereo did not become the standard system for commercial music recording for some years, and remained a specialist market during the 1950s. EMI (UK) was the first company to release commercial stereophonic tapes. They issued their first ''Stereosonic'' tape in 1954. Others quickly followed, under the His Master's Voice and Columbia labels.  161 Stereosonic tapes were released, mostly classical music or lyric recordings. RCA imported these tapes into the USA.\n\nTwo-track stereophonic tapes were more successful in America during the second half of the 1950s.  They were duplicated at real time (1:1) or at twice the normal speed (2:1) when later 4-track tapes were often duplicated at up to 16 times the normal speed, providing a lower sound quality in many cases.  Early American 2-track stereophonic tapes were very expensive.  A typical example is the price list of the Sonotape/Westminster reels:  $6.95, $11.95 and $17.95 for the 7000, 9000 and 8000 series respectively.  Some HMV tapes released in the USA also cost up to $15. The history of stereo recording changed after the late 1957 introduction of the ''Westrex stereo phonograph disc'', which used the groove format developed earlier by Blumlein. [[Decca Records]] in England came out with [[FFRR technique|FFRR]] (Full Frequency Range Recording) in the 1940s, which became internationally accepted as a worldwide standard for higher quality recording on vinyl records. The [[Ernest Ansermet]] recording of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s [[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]] was key in the development of full frequency range records and alerting the listening public to high fidelity in 1946.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vinylrecordscollector.co.uk/text/vinylhist14a.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020621034232/http://www.vinylrecordscollector.co.uk/text/vinylhist14a.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-06-21 |title=Decca's (ffrr) Frequency Series - History Of Vinyl 1 |website=Vinylrecordscollector.co.uk |accessdate=2017-05-24 }}</ref>\n\nRecord companies mixed most popular music singles into monophonic sound until the mid-1960s\u2014then commonly released major recordings in both mono and stereo until the early 1970s. Many 1960s pop albums available only in stereo in the 2000s were originally released only in mono, and record companies produced the \"stereo\" versions of these albums by simply separating the two tracks of the master tape, creating \"pseudo stereo\". In the mid Sixties, as stereo became more popular, many mono recordings (such as The Beach Boys' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'') were remastered using the so-called \"[[Stereophonic sound#Pseudo-stereo|fake stereo]]\" method, which spread the sound across the stereo field by directing higher-frequency sound into one channel and lower-frequency sounds into the other.\n\n==1950s to 1980s==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}\n\nMagnetic tape transformed the recording industry. By the early 1950s, most commercial recordings were mastered on tape instead of recorded directly to disc. Tape facilitated a degree of manipulation in the recording process that was impractical with mixes and multiple generations of directly recorded discs. An early example is [[Les Paul]]'s 1951 recording of ''[[How High the Moon]]'', on which Paul played eight overdubbed guitar tracks. In the 1960s [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]], [[Frank Zappa]], and [[The Beatles]] (with producer [[George Martin]]) were among the first popular artists to explore the possibilities of [[multitrack recording]] techniques and effects on their landmark albums ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', ''[[Freak Out!]]'', and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.\n\nThe next important innovation was small cartridge-based tape systems, of which the [[compact cassette]], commercialized by the [[Philips]] electronics company in 1964, is the best known. Initially a low-fidelity format for spoken-word voice recording and inadequate for music reproduction, after a series of improvements it entirely replaced the competing formats: the larger [[8-track tape]] (used primarily in cars) and the fairly similar \"Deutsche Cassette\" developed by the German company Grundig. This latter system was not particularly common in Europe and practically unheard-of in America. The compact cassette became a major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]], a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979. The Walkman was the first personal music player and it gave a major boost to sales of prerecorded cassettes, which became the first widely successful release format that used a re-recordable medium: the vinyl<!-- avoids BE/AE differences --> record was a playback-only medium and commercially prerecorded tapes for [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape decks]], which many consumers found difficult to operate, were never more than an uncommon niche market item.\n\nA key advance in audio fidelity came with the [[Dolby A]] noise reduction system, invented by [[Ray Dolby]] and introduced into professional recording studios in 1966. It suppressed the light but sometimes quite noticeable steady background of hiss, which was the only easily audible downside of mastering on tape instead of recording directly to disc. A competing system, [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]], invented by David Blackmer, also found success in professional audio. A simpler variant of Dolby's noise reduction system, known as Dolby B, greatly improved the sound of cassette tape recordings by reducing the especially high level of hiss that resulted from the cassette's miniaturized tape format. It, and variants, also eventually found wide application in the recording and film industries. Dolby B was crucial to the popularization<!-- AE appears to be the established variant in this article --> and commercial success of the cassette as a domestic recording and playback medium, and it became a standard feature in the booming home and car stereo market of the 1970s and beyond. The compact cassette format also benefited enormously from improvements to the tape itself as coatings with wider frequency responses and lower inherent noise were developed, often based on cobalt and chrome oxides as the magnetic material instead of the more usual iron oxide.\n\nThe multitrack audio cartridge had been in wide use in the radio industry, from the late 1950s to the 1980s, but in the 1960s the pre-recorded [[8-track cartridge]] was launched as a consumer audio format by [[Bill Lear]] of the Lear Jet aircraft company (and although its correct name was the 'Lear Jet Cartridge', it was seldom referred to as such). Aimed particularly at the automotive market, they were the first practical, affordable car hi-fi systems, and could produce sound quality superior to that of the compact cassette. However the smaller size and greater durability \u2014 augmented by the ability to create home-recorded music \"compilations\" since 8-track recorders were rare \u2014 saw the cassette become the dominant consumer format for portable audio devices in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThere had been experiments with multi-channel sound for many years \u2014 usually for special musical or cultural events \u2014 but the first commercial application of the concept came in the early 1970s with the introduction of [[Quadraphonic]] sound. This spin-off development from multitrack recording used four tracks (instead of the two used in stereo) and four speakers to create a 360-degree audio field around the listener. Following the release of the first consumer 4-channel [[hi-fi]] systems, a number of popular albums were released in one of the competing four-channel formats; among the best known are [[Mike Oldfield]]'s ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''. Quadraphonic sound was not a commercial success, partly because of competing and somewhat incompatible four-channel sound systems (e.g., [[CBS]], [[JVC]], [[Dynaco]] and others all had systems) and generally poor quality, even when played as intended on the correct equipment, of the released music. It eventually faded out in the late 1970s, although this early venture paved the way for the eventual introduction of domestic [[Surround Sound]] systems in home theatre use, which have gained enormous popularity since the introduction of the DVD. This widespread adoption has occurred despite the confusion introduced by the multitude of available surround sound standards.\n\n==Audio components==\n{{main article|High fidelity#Modularity}}\nThe replacement of the relatively fragile thermionic valve ([[vacuum tube]]) by the smaller, lighter-weight, cooler-running, less expensive, more robust, and less power-hungry [[transistor]] also accelerated the sale of consumer high-fidelity \"[[hi-fi]]\" sound systems from the 1960s onward. In the 1950s, most record players were monophonic and had relatively low sound quality. Few consumers could afford high-quality stereophonic sound systems. In the 1960s, American manufacturers introduced a new generation of \"modular\" hi-fi components \u2014 separate turntables, pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, both combined as integrated amplifiers, tape recorders, and other ancillary equipment like the [[graphic equaliser]], which could be connected together to create a complete home sound system. These developments were rapidly taken up by major Japanese electronics companies, which soon flooded the world market with relatively affordable, high-quality transistorized audio components. By the 1980s, corporations like [[Sony]] had become world leaders in the music recording and playback industry.\n\n==Digital recording==\n{{Main article|Digital recording}}\n{{See also|Pulse code modulation|Digital audio|Hard disk recorder|Digital audio workstation}}\n[[File:Pcm.svg|thumb|left|150px|Graphical representation of a sound wave in analog (red) and 4-bit digital (blue).]]\n\nThe advent of [[digital recording|digital sound recording]] and later the [[compact disc]] (CD) in 1982 brought significant improvements in the durability of consumer recordings. The CD initiated another massive wave of change in the consumer music industry, with [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]] effectively relegated to a small niche market by the mid-1990s. However, the record industry fiercely resisted the introduction of digital systems, fearing wholesale piracy on a medium able to produce perfect copies of original released recordings. However, the industry succumbed to the inevitable, though using various protection system (principally [[Serial Copy Management System]], or SCMS).\n[[File:Sony-pcm-m10.jpg|right|thumb| A digital sound recorder from Sony]]\n\nThe most recent and revolutionary developments have been in digital recording, with the development of various uncompressed and compressed digital [[audio file format]]s, [[Microprocessor|processors]] capable and fast enough to convert the digital data to sound in [[Real-time computing|real time]], and inexpensive [[mass storage]]<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society\n|volume=47\n|date=March 1991\n|title=The future of digital audio recording\n|author=Kees Schouhamer Immink\n|authorlink=Kees Schouhamer Immink\n|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322974158\n|pages=171\u2013172\n|quote=Keynote address was presented to the 104th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society in Amsterdam during the society's golden anniversary celebration on May 17, 1998.}}</ref>\n.

Digital audio technology is now used in all areas of audio, from casual use of music files of moderate quality to the most demanding professional applications.

[[Digital dictation]] software for recording and transcribing speech has different requirements; intelligibility and flexible playback facilities are priorities, while a wide frequency range and high audio quality are not.\n\n==Cultural effects==\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo briefs the traveling press (42895283735).jpg|thumb|Many members of the media use recorders to capture remarks]]\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=April 2017}}\nThe development of analog sound recording in the nineteenth century and its widespread use throughout the twentieth century had a huge impact on the development of music. Before analog sound recording was invented, most music was listened to by hearing a live performance, or by singing or playing a song or piece. Throughout the [[Medieval music|medieval]], [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], [[Baroque music|Baroque]], [[Classical music (period)|Classical]], and through much of the [[Romantic music era]], the main way that songs and instrumental pieces were \"recorded\" was by notating the piece in [[music notation]]. While music notation indicates the pitches of the melody and their rhythm, the notation is not like a 2010-era sound recording. Indeed, in the Medieval era, [[Gregorian chant]] did not indicate the rhythm of the chant. In the Baroque era, instrumental pieces often lack a tempo indication and usually none of the ornaments were written down. As a result, each performance of a song or piece would be slightly different.\n\nWith the development of analog sound recording, though, a performance could be permanently fixed, in all of its elements: pitch, rhythm, timbre, ornaments and expression. This meant that many more elements of a performance would be captured and disseminated to other listeners. The development of sound recording also enabled a much larger proportion of people to hear famous orchestras, operas, singers and bands, because even if a non-wealthy person could not afford to hear the live concert, she or he might be able to afford to buy the recording. The availability of sound recording thus helped to spread musical styles to new regions, countries and continents. The cultural influence went in a number of directions. Sound recordings enabled Western music lovers to hear actual recordings of Asian, Middle Eastern and African groups and performers, increasing awareness of non-Western musical styles. At the same time, sound recordings enabled non-Western music lovers to hear the most famous North American and European groups and singers.\n\n==Legal status==\n\nIn copyright law, a \"phonogram\" or \"sound recording\" is a work that results from the fixation of sounds in a medium. The notice of copyright in a phonogram uses the [[sound recording copyright symbol]], which the [[Geneva Phonograms Convention]] defines as \u2117 (the letter P in a full circle). This usually accompanies the copyright notice for the underlying musical composition, which uses the ordinary \u00a9 symbol.\n\nThe recording is separate from the song so copyright for a recording usually belongs to the record company. It is less common for an artist or producer to hold these rights. Copyright for recordings has existed since 1972, while copyright for musical composition, or songs, has existed since 1831. Disputes over [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and \"beats\" are ongoing.<ref name=\"hull2010\">{{cite book |last1=Hull |first1=Geoffrey |title=The Music Business and Recording Industry |date=2010 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0203843192 |pages=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXpMvQEACAAJ }}</ref>\n\n=== US ===\n\nUnited States copyright law defines \"sound recordings\" as \"works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds\" other than an audiovisual work's soundtrack.<ref>17 U.S.C. \u00a7101</ref> Prior to the Sound Recording Amendment (SRA),<ref>Pub.

The gun utilized the barrel of the [[M101 howitzer|105 mm Howitzer M2]], shortened and fitted to a slightly modified [[split trail]] carriage of the [[M116 howitzer|75 mm pack howitzer]].\n\nThe howitzer was used by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] during [[World War II]]. It was issued to airborne units and the cannon [[Company (military)|companies]] of infantry [[regiment]]s.\n\n==Development and production==\nThe process of building airborne forces in 1941 led to a requirement for an air portable 105&nbsp;mm howitzer. The weapon, initially designated T7, featured a [[Gun barrel|barrel]] from the [[M101 howitzer|105mm Howitzer M2]], shortened by {{convert|27|in|mm}} and combined with a recoil system and carriage of the [[M116 howitzer|75 mm field howitzer]]. A prototype reached trials at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] in March 1942.<ref name=ZALOGA-USFA-13>Zaloga - ''US Field Artillery of World War II'', p 13-14.</ref>\n\nThe howitzer was designed to fire the same ammunition as the longer M2. However, it turned out that shorter barrel resulted in incomplete burning of the propelling charge. The problem could be solved by use of faster burning powder. Otherwise the design was considered acceptable and was standardized as '''105&nbsp;mm Howitzer M3 on Carriage M3'''. The carriage was soon succeeded by the M3A1, which had trails made from thicker plate. Even stronger tubular trails were designed, but never reached production.<ref name=ZALOGA-USFA-13/>\n\nThe production started in February 1943 and continued until May 1944; an additional batch was produced in April\u2013June 1945.<ref name=ZALOGA-USFA-13/>\n\n{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em; width:55%; background:#fff; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #996; line-height:1.5; font-size:95%\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#996; color:#fff; font-weight:bold;\"\n| colspan=\"12\"| Production of \u041c3, pcs.<ref name=ZALOGA-USFA-9>Zaloga - ''US Field Artillery of World War II'', p 9.</ref>\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#ddb; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | Year\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 1943\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 1944\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 1945\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | Total\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #996; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | Produced, pcs.\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 1,965\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 410\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 205\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 2,580\n|}\n\n==Service==\nThe initial production of the M3 was adequate to equip the three hundred Infantry Regiment's Cannon Companies that had been forecast in the initial war plans. The M3 was the primary weapon of the Infantry Regimental Cannon Companies and appear in the Tables of Organization and Equipment in early 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryresearch.org/7-14%2026Feb44.pdf|title=T/O&E 7-14 Infantry Cannon Company (26 February 1944)|accessdate=12 Feb 2019}}</ref>Even though the M3 was not mentioned in the February 1944 Tables of Organization and Equipment (TO&E), shortly before the Normandy Airdrops some airborne divisions received a 105&nbsp;mm [[military glider|glider]] field artillery [[battalion]] equipped with them as a supplement to their existing three [[M116 howitzer|75 mm howitzer]] battalions (designated the M1A1 during World War II). [[Willys MB|1/4 ton jeep]]s were used as [[artillery tractor|prime mover]]s. Later increased to four battalions, one, between 1943 and 1945, was converted to 105mm M3. The weapon was finally authorized as an option by the December 1944 TO&E and, by 1945, employed by all airborne divisions in the [[European Theater of Operations|European Theater]].<ref name=ZALOGA-USFA-13/><ref name=\"ZALOGA-USAD-37\">Zaloga - ''US Airborne Divisions in the ETO 1944-45'', p 37.</ref>\n\nThe M3 was also issued to the cannon [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of infantry [[regiment]]s (six, in three platoons of two).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryresearch.org/7-14%2026Feb44.pdf|title=T/O&E 7-14 Infantry Cannon Company (26 February 1944)|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> Often the cannon companies were integrated into the division artillery.

The main problem was the substitution of towed low-velocity howitzers for the self-propelled versions as originally intended. This howitzer, the M3 , had a shorter barrel than the regular 105-mm howitzer M2, possessed no ballistic shield, and had an effective range on only 7,250 yards as compared to 12,500 yards for the M2.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a210927.pdf|title = THE CANNON COMPANY - A WORLD WAR II SOLUTION TO THE CLOSE SUPPORT PROBLEM OF THE 1990s A Monograph By Major John H.

The gun utilized the barrel of the [[M101 howitzer|105 mm Howitzer M2]], shortened and fitted to a slightly modified [[split trail]] carriage of the [[M116 howitzer|75 mm pack howitzer]].\n\nThe howitzer was used by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] during [[World War II]]. It was issued to airborne units and the cannon [[Company (military)|companies]] of infantry [[regiment]]s.\n\n==Development and production==\nThe process of building airborne forces in 1941 led to a requirement for an air portable 105&nbsp;mm howitzer. The weapon, initially designated T7, featured a [[Gun barrel|barrel]] from the [[M101 howitzer|105mm Howitzer M2]], shortened by {{convert|27|in|mm}} and combined with a recoil system and carriage of the [[M116 howitzer|75 mm field howitzer]]. A prototype reached trials at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] in March 1942.<ref name=ZALOGA-USFA-13>Zaloga - ''US Field Artillery of World War II'', p 13-14.</ref>\n\nThe howitzer was designed to fire the same ammunition as the longer M2. However, it turned out that shorter barrel resulted in incomplete burning of the propelling charge. The problem could be solved by use of faster burning powder. Otherwise the design was considered acceptable and was standardized as '''105&nbsp;mm Howitzer M3 on Carriage M3'''. The carriage was soon succeeded by the M3A1, which had trails made from thicker plate. Even stronger tubular trails were designed, but never reached production.<ref name=ZALOGA-USFA-13/>\n\nThe production started in February 1943 and continued until May 1944; an additional batch was produced in April\u2013June 1945.<ref name=ZALOGA-USFA-13/>\n\n{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em; width:55%; background:#fff; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #996; line-height:1.5; font-size:95%\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#996; color:#fff; font-weight:bold;\"\n| colspan=\"12\"| Production of \u041c3, pcs.<ref name=ZALOGA-USFA-9>Zaloga - ''US Field Artillery of World War II'', p 9.</ref>\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#ddb; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | Year\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 1943\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 1944\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 1945\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | Total\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #996; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | Produced, pcs.\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 1,965\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 410\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 205\n| style=\"border:1px solid #996\" | 2,580\n|}\n\n==Service==\nThe initial production of the M3 was adequate to equip the three hundred Infantry Regiment's Cannon Companies that had been forecast in the initial war plans.

[[Willys MB|1/4 ton jeep]]s were used as [[artillery tractor|prime mover]]s. Later increased to four battalions, one, between 1943 and 1945, was converted to 105mm M3. The weapon was finally authorized as an option by the December 1944 TO&E and, by 1945, employed by all airborne divisions in the [[European Theater of Operations|European Theater]].<ref name=ZALOGA-USFA-13/><ref name=\"ZALOGA-USAD-37\">Zaloga - ''US Airborne Divisions in the ETO 1944-45'', p 37.</ref>\n\nThe M3 was also issued to the cannon [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of infantry [[regiment]]s (six, in three platoons of two).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryresearch.org/7-14%2026Feb44.pdf|title=T/O&E 7-14 Infantry Cannon Company (26 February 1944)|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> Often the cannon companies were integrated into the division artillery.

The main problem was the substitution of towed low-velocity howitzers for the self-propelled versions as originally intended. This howitzer, the M3 , had a shorter barrel than the regular 105-mm howitzer M2, possessed no ballistic shield, and had an effective range on only 7,250 yards as compared to 12,500 yards for the M2.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a210927.pdf|title = THE CANNON COMPANY - A WORLD WAR II SOLUTION TO THE CLOSE SUPPORT PROBLEM OF THE 1990's A Monograph By Major John H.

Haseltine when he coined the term during a conference on Lake Como, to describe interventions that restore to normal function that which is damaged by disease, injured by trauma, or worn by time.<ref>https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2004/nsf0450/ Viola, J., Lal, B., and Grad, O. ''The Emergence of Tissue Engineering as a Research Field''.

He recognized that these cells' unique ability to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into all the cell types of the human body ([[pluripotency]]) had the potential to develop into a new kind of regenerative therapy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Ron|title=Liberation Biology: The Scientific and Moral Case for the Biotech Revolution|year=2005|publisher=Prometheus Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Brian|title=Don't Die, Stay Pretty: The exploding science of superlongevity |url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.01/forever_pr.html|newspaper=Wired}}</ref> Explaining the new class of therapies that such cells could enable, he used the term \"regenerative medicine\" in the way that it is used today: \"an approach to therapy that ... employs human genes, proteins and cells to re-grow, restore or provide mechanical replacements for tissues that have been injured by trauma, damaged by disease or worn by time\" and \"offers the prospect of curing diseases that cannot be treated effectively today, including those related to aging\".<ref name=\"Haseltine2001\">{{cite journal|last1=Haseltine|first1=WA|title=The Emergence of Regenerative Medicine: A New Field and a New Society|journal=E-biomed: The Journal of Regenerative Medicine|date=6 July 2004|volume=2|issue=4|pages=17\u201323|doi=10.1089/152489001753309652}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Mao AS, Mooney DJ | date = Nov 2015 | title = Regenerative medicine: Current therapies and future directions | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 112 | issue = 47| pages = 14452\u20139 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1508520112 | pmid = 26598661 | pmc=4664309}}</ref>\n\nLater, Haseltine would go on to explain that regenerative medicine acknowledges the reality that most people, regardless of which illness they have or which treatment they require, simply want to be restored to normal health. Designed to be applied broadly, the original definition includes cell and stem cell therapies, gene therapy, tissue engineering, genomic medicine, personalized medicine, biomechanical prosthetics, recombinant proteins, and antibody treatments. It also includes more familiar chemical pharmacopeia\u2014in short, any intervention that restores a person to normal health. In addition to functioning as shorthand for a wide range of technologies and treatments, the term \u201cregenerative medicine\u201d is also patient friendly. It solves the problem of confusing or intimidating language discourage to patients.\n\nThe term regenerative medicine is increasingly conflated with research on stem cell therapies.

Adult stem cells were extracted from the patient's bone marrow, grown into a large population, and matured into cartilage cells, or [[chondrocyte]]s, using an adaptive method originally devised for treating osteoarthritis. The team then seeded the newly grown chondrocytes, as well as epithelial cells, into a decellularised (free of donor cells) tracheal segment that was donated from a 51-year-old transplant donor who had died of cerebral hemorrhage. After four days of seeding, the graft was used to replace the patient's left main bronchus. After one month, a biopsy elicited local bleeding, indicating that the blood vessels had already grown back successfully.<ref>{{cite

Haseltine when he coined the term during a conference on Lake Como, to describe interventions that restore to normal function that which is damaged by disease, injured by trauma, or worn by time.<ref>https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2004/nsf0450/ Viola, J., Lal, B., and Grad, O.

Designed to be applied broadly, the original definition includes cell and stem cell therapies, gene therapy, tissue engineering, genomic medicine, personalized medicine, biomechanical prosthetics, recombinant proteins, and antibody treatments. It also includes more familiar chemical pharmacopeia\u2014in short, any intervention that restores a person to normal health. In addition to functioning as shorthand for a wide range of technologies and treatments, the term \u201cregenerative medicine\u201d is also patient friendly. It solves the problem of confusing or intimidating language discourage to patients. \n\nThe term regenerative medicine is increasingly conflated with research on stem cell therapies.

Adult stem cells were extracted from the patient's bone marrow, grown into a large population, and matured into cartilage cells, or [[chondrocyte]]s, using an adaptive method originally devised for treating osteoarthritis. The team then seeded the newly grown chondrocytes, as well as epithelial cells, into a decellularised (free of donor cells) tracheal segment that was donated from a 51-year-old transplant donor who had died of cerebral hemorrhage. After four days of seeding, the graft was used to replace the patient's left main bronchus. After one month, a biopsy elicited local bleeding, indicating that the blood vessels had already grown back successfully.<ref>{{cite

It is there that writer/star Vince Offer thanks the creators of There's Something About Mary for stealing elements of this film to make theirs. He claims he sent them a promotional videotape copy of Underground in 1997 and they pilfered his jokes and made untold fortunes. The movie poster even claims that a \"lawsuit is pending.\" Hmmm. After viewing both Offer's The Underground Comedy Movie and the Farrelly Brothers' There's Something About Mary, we learn that there are indeed some things the films have in common: 1. They are both shot on 35mm film, 2. They are both in English, 3. They are both in color, and 4. They both have stereo soundtracks. I could go on ... Both films show people driving in automobiles, both films have daytime AND nighttime scenes, and the opening and closing credits of both films feature lettering in both upper and lowercase white lettering. Yes, the similarities are eerie, aren't they? Other than those things, there is not one frame of Underground that bares even the slightest resemblance to Mary. If this frivolous lawsuit ever goes to trial, Offer and company better hope I'm not on the jury. If there is to be a lawsuit, it should really be directed at Offer, who has stolen (in some cases, word for word/scene for scene) elements of such 70s and 80s low-brow comedies as Kentucky Fried Movie, Groove Tube, and Amazon Women on the Moon and turned them into a frighteningly unfunny mix of scenes that confuse rather than amuse. It may be marketing genius to claim someone stole your film ideas just to get people to pay $8 to see what all the fuss is about, but in the case of The Underground Comedy Movie, I think the Farrelly Brothers and 20th Century Fox may have grounds to sue Offer for huge damages just for being compared to such a horribly made film as the inept Underground Comedy Movie.\"|source= \u2014Michael Lancaster, The Hastings Bad Cinema Society<ref>{{cite web |title=Critic's Corner S-Z |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010412233933/http://thestinkers.com/critics3.html#Underground%20Comedy%20Movie |website=The Stinkers |accessdate=5 November 2019}}</ref>}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Stinkers Bad Movie Awards |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Award ceremony presented by the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards in 2006}}\n{{Infobox film awards\n| number           = 22\n| award            = Stinkers Bad Movie Awards\n| date             = 2000\n| film             =''[[Wild Wild West]]''\n| most_wins        =''[[Wild Wild West]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' (4)\n| most_nominations =''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (10)\n| last             = 1998\n| next             = 2000\n}}\n\nThe '''22nd [[Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]]''' were released by the Hastings Bad Cinema Society in 2000 to honour the worst films the film industry had to offer in 1999.

It is there that writer/star Vince Offer thanks the creators of There's Something About Mary for stealing elements of this film to make theirs. He claims he sent them a promotional videotape copy of Underground in 1997 and they pilfered his jokes and made untold fortunes. The movie poster even claims that a \"lawsuit is pending.\" Hmmm. After viewing both Offer's The Underground Comedy Movie and the Farrelly Brothers' There's Something About Mary, we learn that there are indeed some things the films have in common: 1. They are both shot on 35mm film, 2. They are both in English, 3. They are both in color, and 4. They both have stereo soundtracks. I could go on ... Both films show people driving in automobiles, both films have daytime AND nighttime scenes, and the opening and closing credits of both films feature lettering in both upper and lowercase white lettering. Yes, the similarities are eerie, aren't they? Other than those things, there is not one frame of Underground that bares even the slightest resemblance to Mary. If this frivolous lawsuit ever goes to trial, Offer and company better hope I'm not on the jury. If there is to be a lawsuit, it should really be directed at Offer, who has stolen (in some cases, word for word/scene for scene) elements of such 70s and 80s low-brow comedies as Kentucky Fried Movie, Groove Tube, and Amazon Women on the Moon and turned them into a frighteningly unfunny mix of scenes that confuse rather than amuse. It may be marketing genius to claim someone stole your film ideas just to get people to pay $8 to see what all the fuss is about, but in the case of The Underground Comedy Movie, I think the Farrelly Brothers and 20th Century Fox may have grounds to sue Offer for huge damages just for being compared to such a horribly made film as the inept Underground Comedy Movie.\"|source= \u2014Michael Lancaster, The Hastings Bad Cinema Society<ref>{{cite web |title=Critic's Corner S-Z |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010412233933/http://thestinkers.com/critics3.html#Underground%20Comedy%20Movie |website=The Stinkers |accessdate=5 November 2019}}</ref>}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Stinkers Bad Movie Awards |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Stinkers_Bad_Movie_Awards"}

Finding himself ethically opposed to bioengineering, he began to travel and research the politics of food, and work as an artist in London, Ontario.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1979, he worked as a brakeman and conductor on the Norfolk and Western (Wabash) Railway, and was a member of the United Transportation Union. In 1973 he began to travel frequently in Mexico, Central & South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In March 1980, he attended the World Conference of Indigenous Peoples, in Ollantaytambo, Peru, as an official artist/observer.\n\nFrom 1975 through 1981, Ron was a member of the Forest City Artists' Association, and was manager of the [[Forest City Gallery]] in 1980\u201381. In 1983 he co-founded the Embassy Cultural House and served on the board until 1990. Co-organized the M\u00e9rida/London exchange (1980/81), as well as the Havana/London exchange (1988). In 1989 he was an artist/observer of the 3rd [[Havana Biennial]].\n\nIn 2000 he was awarded the Canada Council Studio in Paris.\n\nIn 2010 he was appointed Adjunct Research Professor in the Visual Arts Department, [[University of Western Ontario|Western University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vac.ca/ronbenner.html|title=Ron Benner - Trans/mission: Barley-Corn-Maize|website=Visual Arts Centre of Clarington|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis mixed media photographic installations are in the collections of the [[National Gallery of Canada]], the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]] (The University of Toronto), [[Museum London]] (London, Ontario), McIntosh Gallery (The University of Western Ontario), The Canada Council Art Bank and the [[Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas|Casa de Las Americas]] (Havana, Cuba).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cacnart.com/ron-benner|title=Ron Benner|website=cacnart|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n== Selected solo exhibitions ==\n\n* 2019 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ''Trans/mission: Barley \u2013 Corn \u2013 Maize'', Visual Arts Centre of Clarington, Bowmanville, ON, a year-long site-specific installation responding to the architecture and history of the former barley mill, curator Sandy Saad<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vac.ca/ronbenner.html|title=Ron Benner - Trans/mission: Barley-Corn-Maize|website=Visual Arts Centre of Clarington|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2017-         ''Trans/mission: Native to the Americas,'' permanent photographic/garden installation, sunken garden of the Wilfrid Laurier Library, organized by the Robert Langen Art Gallery, Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, ON<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.wlu.ca/events/exhibition-transend-meeting-room|title=Exhibition: Transend: Meeting Room|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* 2017 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0''Transend: Meeting Room'', Robert Langen Art Gallery, [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], Waterloo, ON, curator Suzanne Luke<ref name=\":2\" />\n* 2016/17 \u00a0 \u00a0 ''Trans/mission: 101,'' photographic/garden installation, [https://kwag.ca/ Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery], Kitchener, ON, curator Crystal Mowry presented in concert with CAFKA 16 (Contemporary Art Forum Kitchener Area)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kwag.ca/content/ron-benner-transmission-101|title=Ron Benner // Trans/mission: 101|last=smitchell|date=2017-05-17|website=kwag.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2015\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0''Ron Benner: 3 Questions'', McIntosh Gallery, Western University, London, ON, curator Julian Haladyn<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mcintoshgallery.ca/exhibitions/past/2015.html|title=2015|website=mcintoshgallery.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2015 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ''All That Has Value'', 3 guerrilla garden installations, in collaboration with CUPE, London, ON\n* 2015 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ''In Digestion'', [[Museum London]], London, ON<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://museumlondon.ca/exhibitions/in-digestion|title=Exhibitions - Museum London|website=museumlondon.ca|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2013\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0''Insubstantial Equivalence'', photographic/garden installation, curator Peter Dykhuis, on the university campus in partnership with the agricultural faculty and the Dalhousie Art Gallery, Halifax, NS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dal.ca/news/2013/10/03/food-for-thought.html|title=Food for thought|website=Dalhousie News|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2012-15 \u00a0 \u00a0''Cuitlacoche \u2013 Your\u00a0 Disease Our Delicacy'',\u00a0 photographic/garden installation, curator Su Ying\u00a0 Lee, Hart House and Justina M.
