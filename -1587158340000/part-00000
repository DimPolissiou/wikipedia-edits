It is most famous as the victor of the [[1959 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Aston Martin's only outright victory at the endurance classic. It is one of only three cars in the 1950s to win both the World Sports Car Championship and Le Mans 24 Hours in the same year (the others being the [[Ferrari 375 Plus]] in 1954 and the [[Ferrari TR|Ferrari 250TR]] in 1958). In addition the six World Sports Car Championship victories was a record for any car in the 1950s and remained a record in the championship until surpassed by the Ferrari 250TR. The three consecutive triumphs in 1959 at the N\u00fcrburgring, Le Mans and the [[RAC Tourist Trophy|Tourist Trophy]] equalled the record set by the Ferrari 250TR with its three consecutive victories at the start of the 1958 season.\n\nIn August 2017, car DBR1/1 was sold for a world record price for a British-made car of US$22,555,000.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Cameron |last=Kirby |date=21 August 2017|title=Stunning Aston Martin DBR1 breaks auction record |url=https://www.wheelsmag.com.au/news/1708/stunning-aston-martin-dbr1-breaks-auction-record |magazine=Wheels Magazine |accessdate=21 August 2017 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\nFollowing changes to the rules for sportscar racing, entrants no longer had to use cars which were road legal, or based on road legal cars, such as the [[Aston Martin DB3S]].

Most notable was that the back of the front wheel well was no longer left open.  Instead, the DBR1 featured full bodywork with a large triangular vent on the side, a design trait which would become standard on all future Aston Martins.\n\nThe DBR1 was initially fitted with a smaller 2.5-litre (2493 cc) new all alloy racing engine (RB6.250) very loosely derived from the racing version of the [[Lagonda Straight-6 engine]] to comply with that year's Le Mans 24 Hour regulations whilst the RB6.300 Straight-6 (2992 cc), rated at {{Convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was developed for the 1957 season.\n\n==Racing history==\n\n===1956===\nDebuting at the non championship [[1956 24 Hours of Le Mans]], [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]]'s Aston Martin racing team set out with the 2.5-litre DBR1/1 alongside two older 2.9-litre DB3Ss. Although performing well through most of the race against larger engined cars such as the winning Jaguar D-type with its 3.4-litre engine, the DBR1 suffered gearbox failure after 246 laps whilst lying seventh, forcing drivers [[Reg Parnell]] and [[Tony Brooks (racing driver)|Tony Brooks]] to retire.\n\n===1957===\n[[File:1957 Aston Martin Tony Brooks Hotel de France.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tony Brooks with mechanic, Eric Hind parked outside the 1957 Le Mans [[Aston Martin]] base, the [[Hotel de France (Le Mans / La Chartre sur le Loir)|Hotel de France]], at the wheel of his DBR1 race car.]]\nMaking a full debut in the [[1957 World Sportscar Championship season]] as well as various non-championship races, Aston Martin started the season with DBR1/1 in 2.5-litre form and the car recorded its first finish, with a second place for [[Roy Salvadori]] at the British Empire Trophy, followed by another second place at the [[Goodwood Circuit]]'s Sussex Trophy. DBR1/1 was then upgraded with the newer 3.0-litre engine, and joined by the identical DBR1/2. Together at the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa]] Sportscar Race, Aston Martin took the top two spots, with Tony Brooks winning over [[Roy Salvadori]]. The DBR1s then made their [[World Sportscar Championship]] debut in the fourth round, the [[1000km N\u00fcrburgring]]. Here DBR1/2 took an overall victory at the hands of Brooks and No\u00ebl Cunningham-Reid, earning Aston Martin its first World Championship win since the Collins/Griffith DB3S had won the Tourist Trophy in 1953. Salvadori and [[Les Leston]] finished sixth in the same race in DBR1/1. The victory against the full works might of Ferrari and [[Maserati in motorsport|Maserati]] with their [[Ferrari 335 S|335S]] and [[Maserati 450S|450S]] models in the hands of drivers such as [[Peter Collins (racing driver)|Peter Collins]], [[Mike Hawthorn]], Moss and [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] gave the Aston Martin team confidence that they now had a car that could compete against the best in the world. Unfortunately these hopes were dashed at the [[1957 24 Hours of Le Mans]] when both DBR1s failed to finish.  The failure at Le Mans meant that any hopes of the World Championship had gone and Aston Martin missed the final two rounds in Sweden and Venezuela. Instead they entered the non-championship [[Spa Grand Prix]], where DBR1/2 took the only other victory of the year in the hands of Brooks ahead of [[Masten Gregory]] in a [[Ferrari 290 MM]] and [[Olivier Gendebien]] in a Ferrari 335S with Salvadori fourth in DBR1/1.\n\n===1958===\nFor 1958, DBR1/3 was completed and Aston Martin now had three cars with which to compete. The World Sports Car Championship was now restricted to cars of no more than 3-litres and the team's [[Aston Martin DBR2|DBR2]] model with its 3.7-litre engine was ineligible. [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]] therefore chose to concentrate on the Championship with the DBR1, leaving the DBR2 for non-championship races.  The team did not enter the opening round in Buenos Aires which was won by Ferrari, deciding instead to race at the following round, the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. Neither DBR1 managed to finish, both suffering gearbox failure, although in the hands of Moss it was the fastest car in the race. This was followed at the [[Targa Florio]], with the new DBR1/3 also suffering a gearbox failure and not finishing but not before Moss had broken his old lap record set in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SL|Mercedes 300SLR]] by over a minute.  At the 1000&nbsp;km N\u00fcrburgring, where the DBR1 had won the previous year, Aston Martin managed to repeat their victory, with Moss and [[Jack Brabham]]'s DBR1/3 beating a large contingent of [[Ferrari]]s and [[Porsche]]s. Unfortunately the bad luck returned at Le Mans, with all three DBR1s failing to finish again. However, at the season ending Tourist Trophy, Aston Martin managed a 1-2-3 finish with Moss and Brooks driving the winning car (DBR1/2) ahead of Salvadori/Brabham in DBR1/1 and Shelby/[[Stuart Lewis-Evans]] in DBR1/3. However Ferrari had chosen not to compete having already won the championship and the race was only of four hour duration and consequently only half points were awarded. This victory allowed Aston Martin to finish second in the constructor's championship behind Ferrari.\n\n===1959===\n{{Listen|filename=Aston Martin DBR1 (1957).ogg|pos=left|title=Aston Martin DBR1|description=Aston Martin DBR1 at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2009}}\nReturning again for 1959, Aston Martin had completed two more chassis, DBR1/4 and DBR1/5. The first car was actually a conversion from a [[Aston Martin DBR3|DBR3]], while DBR1/5 was a spare chassis sold to privateer [[Graham Whitehead]]. This latter car was the only DBR1 to be sold to a privateer during the 1956-9 period when the factory team campaigned with them.  With four chassis, Aston Martin would again concentrate on the World Sportscar Championship. The season started slowly, with a sole entry, DBR1/1, in the hands of Salvadori and Shelby failing to finish at the [[1959 12 Hours of Sebring|12 Hours of Sebring]] which resulted in a 1-2 for Ferrari with their 250TR model. This was then followed by the team not appearing at the [[Targa Florio]] which was won by Porsche with a 1-2-3-4. Aston Martin then completed a hat trick of victories as the sole factory entry (DBR1/1) again won the [[1959 1000km N\u00fcrburgring|1000km N\u00fcrburgring]], with Moss and [[Jack Fairman]] driving.  In addition to this victory, Aston Martin finally achieved what is considered their finest motorsports triumph. DBR1/2, driven by [[Carroll Shelby]] and Salvadori, took victory at the [[1959 24 Hours of Le Mans]].  DBR1/4, driven by [[Maurice Trintignant]] and [[Paul Fr\u00e9re]], managed second. The next closest competitor was a distant 25 laps behind the duo.\n\nWith the constructors championship now closely contested by Ferrari, Porsche and Aston Martin, the team appeared at the final round, the Tourist Trophy at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]].  Aston Martin entered three DBR1s, as well as privateer Whitehead's DBR1/5. During the race, DBR1/3 which had been leading caught fire whilst refuelling in the pits, damaging the car too badly to continue and leaving Aston Martin without room to refuel their other cars. To salvage Aston Martin's hopes of the championship, Whitehead withdrew his entry from the race in order to allow Aston Martin to use his pits stall and finish the race. Moss took over the car driven by Shelby and Fairman and in DBR1/2 was able to secure victory and the championship. The remaining Aston, DBR1/4, in the hands of Trintignant/Frere came fourth. Aston Martin scored 24 points from their three victories with Ferrari in second place with a net 18 points, 22 gross and Porsche third also with a net 18 points but 21 gross. This was the only World Sports Car Championship won by Aston Martin.\n\n===Privateers===\nFollowing Aston Martin's success in 1959, [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]] decided to make a move to [[Formula One]] with the [[Aston Martin DBR4|DBR4]] and [[Aston Martin DBR5|DBR5]] that ultimately proved unsuccessful. Thus the factory's David Brown Racing Department would no longer compete in sports cars. The four DBR1s retained by the factory, including the rebuilt DBR1/3, were sold off to customers for use in various series.\n\nNotable privateers included [[Border Reivers]], Ian Baille, David Hamm, and Essex Racing Stable. DBR1/3 finished 3rd at 1960 Oulton Park, 3rd at Le Mans driven by Salvadori and [[Jim Clark]], and in 1961, finished 1st at Charterhall driven by Ron Flockhart for the final victory for any DBR1. DBR1/2 won the 1960 Rouen Grand Prix with Fairman. In 1961, two DBR1s failed to finish at Le Mans driven by Salvadori and [[Tony Maggs]] and [[Ron Flockhart (racing driver)|Ron Flockhart]] and Clark. Following the 1962 season, all DBR1s would retire from racing and eventually end up in museums or private collections. DBR1/3 is on display at the [[Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].1956\n\nDBR1/4 is notable for having appeared in the 1959 film adaptation of [[The Sound and the Fury (1959 film)|The Sound and the Fury]].\n\n==Chassis==\n[[File:1957AstonMartinDBR1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aston Martin DBR1/2 at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2009]]\n[[File:DBR1Back.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A rear view of a DBR1 replica at 2006 RM Auctions Monterey.]]\nIncluded are a list of victories by each chassis.\n\n* '''DBR1/1''' \u2013 Completed 1956\n** 1959 1000&nbsp;km N\u00fcrburgring\n* '''DBR1/2''' \u2013 Completed 1957\n** 1957 Spa Sportscar Race\n** 1957 1000&nbsp;km N\u00fcrburgring\n** 1957 Spa Grand Prix\n** 1958 Goodwood Tourist Trophy\n** 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans (overall winner)\n** 1959 Goodwood Tourist Trophy\n** 1960 Rouen Grand Prix (as a privateer)\n* '''DBR1/3''' \u2013 Completed 1958\n** 1958 1000&nbsp;km N\u00fcrburgring - Moss/Jack Brabham (overall winner)\n** 1961 Charterhall - Flockhart (overall winner)\n* '''DBR1/4''' \u2013 Completed 1959 (conversion from DBR3/1)\n** ''None''\n* '''DBR1/5''' \u2013 Completed 1959\n** ''None''\n\n==DBR3==\n{{main|Aston Martin DBR3}}\nAston Martin used a chassis initially meant for the DBR1 to construct a car known as [[Aston Martin DBR3|DBR3]], and given the chassis number DBR3/1. The car was different in that it used Aston Martin's newly designed 3.7-litre (3670cc) Straight-6 from the [[Aston Martin DB4]], downsized to 3.0-litre (2990cc).  The car was used in only a single race in 1958 before it was deemed uncompetitive.  DBR3/1 was thus given a normal Lagonda Straight-6 and rechristened as DBR1/4.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n''Racing With The David Brown Aston Martin's'' by John Wyer {{ISBN|0-85184-036-1}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Aston Martin DBR1}}\n* [http://www.astonmartins.com/racing/dbr1.htm Aston Martin Picture Gallery - DBR1]\n* [http://wspr-racing.com/chassis/aston.htm WSPR Racing - Aston Martin Chassis Numbers]\n\n{{David Brown Ltd.}}\n{{Aston Martin}}\n{{Aston Martin Sportscar Racers}}\n\n[[Category:Aston Martin racing cars|DBR1]]\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans race cars]]\n[[Category:Le Mans winning cars]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=July 2017}}\n{{Racing car\n| Car_name         = Aston Martin DBR1\n| Image            = [[File:Aston Martin DBR1 at Silverstone classic 2008.jpg|frameless|upright=1.25]]\n|caption           = ''Aston Martin DBR1/4, next to an Aston Martin DB3S/10 at Silverstone Classic 2008''\n| Category         = [[24 Hours of Le Mans#Cars|Le Mans Racer]] [[Sports car racing]] \n| Constructor      = [[Aston Martin Lagonda Limited|Aston Martin Lagonda LTD]]\n| Designer         = [[Ted Cutting]] \n| Team             = {{flagicon|UK}} [[David Brown Ltd.|David Brown]]<br> {{flagicon|SCO}} [[Border Reivers]]\n| Drivers          = {{flagicon|UK}} [[Tony Brooks (racing driver)|Tony Brooks]], <br>{{flagicon|UK}} [[Reg Parnell]],<br>{{flagicon|UK}} [[Roy Salvadori]],<br>{{flagicon|UK}} [[Les Leston]],<br>{{flagicon|UK}} No\u00ebl Cunningham-Reid,<br>{{flagicon|UK}} [[Stuart Lewis-Evans]],<br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Carroll Shelby]],<br>{{flagicon|UK}} [[Stirling Moss]],<br>{{flagicon|Australia}} [[Jack Brabham]],<br>{{flagicon|France}} [[Maurice Trintignant]], <br>{{flagicon|UK}} [[Jack Fairman]],<br>{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Paul Frere]], <br> {{flagicon|SCO}} [[Jim Clark]]\n| Technical ref    = \n| Chassis          = Multi-tubular, [[space frame]] design\n| Front suspension = [[Torsion bar suspension|Torsion bar]] and [[trailing arm]]s\n| Rear suspension  = [[De Dion tube|De Dion]] with longitudinal [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and [[Watt's linkage|Watt linkage]]\n| Length           = {{convert|13|ft|2.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n| Width            = {{convert|5|ft|4|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n| Height           = {{convert|3|ft|2.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n| Wheelbase        = {{convert|7|ft|6|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n| Track            = {{convert|4|ft|3.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n| Engine name      = [[Aston Martin]]\n| Horse Power      = {{Convert|255|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n| Capacity         = 2,493 cc / 2,922 cc,\n| Configuration    = Straight six,\n| Turbo/NA         = \n| Engine position  = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|FR Layout]]\n| Gearbox name     = David Brown CG537\n| Gears            = 5-speed\n| Type             = [[Manual transmission|Manual]]\n| Differential     = \n| Weight           = {{convert|1765|lb|abbr=on}}\n| Fuel             = \n| Tyres            = [[Avon Tyres#Avon Rubber plc|Avon]]\n| Debut            = [[1956 24 Hours of Le Mans]]\n| Races            = 18<br>Inc 4 Le Mans\n| Wins             = 9<br>Inc 1959 Le Mans\n| Cons_champ       = 1 (1959)\n| Drivers_champ    = \n| Poles            = \n| Fastest_laps     = \n|}}\nThe '''Aston Martin DBR1''' was a [[sports car|sports]] [[racing car]] built by [[Aston Martin]] starting in 1956, intended for the [[World Sportscar Championship]] as well as non-championship sportscar races at the time.

Instead, the DBR1 featured full bodywork with a large triangular vent on the side, a design trait which would become standard on all future Aston Martins.\n\nThe DBR1 was initially fitted with a smaller 2.5-litre (2493 cc) new all alloy racing engine (RB6.250) very loosely derived from the racing version of the [[Lagonda Straight-6 engine]] to comply with that year's Le Mans 24 Hour regulations whilst the RB6.300 Straight-6 (2992 cc), rated at {{Convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was developed for the 1957 season.\n\n==Racing history==\n\n===1956===\nDebuting at the non championship [[1956 24 Hours of Le Mans]], [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]]'s Aston Martin racing team set out with the 2.5-litre DBR1/1 alongside two older 2.9-litre DB3Ss. Although performing well through most of the race against larger engined cars such as the winning Jaguar D-type with its 3.4-litre engine, the DBR1 suffered gearbox failure after 246 laps whilst lying seventh, forcing drivers [[Reg Parnell]] and [[Tony Brooks (racing driver)|Tony Brooks]] to retire.\n\n===1957===\n[[File:1957 Aston Martin Tony Brooks Hotel de France.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tony Brooks with mechanic, Eric Hind parked outside the 1957 Le Mans [[Aston Martin]] base, the [[Hotel de France (Le Mans / La Chartre sur le Loir)|Hotel de France]], at the wheel of his DBR1 race car.]]\nMaking a full debut in the [[1957 World Sportscar Championship season]] as well as various non-championship races, Aston Martin started the season with DBR1/1 in 2.5-litre form and the car recorded its first finish, with a second place for [[Roy Salvadori]] at the British Empire Trophy, followed by another second place at the [[Goodwood Circuit]]'s Sussex Trophy. DBR1/1 was then upgraded with the newer 3.0-litre engine, and joined by the identical DBR1/2. Together at the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa]] Sportscar Race, Aston Martin took the top two spots, with Tony Brooks winning over [[Roy Salvadori]]. The DBR1s then made their [[World Sportscar Championship]] debut in the fourth round, the [[1000km N\u00fcrburgring]]. Here DBR1/2 took an overall victory at the hands of Brooks and No\u00ebl Cunningham-Reid, earning Aston Martin its first World Championship win since the Collins/Griffith DB3S had won the Tourist Trophy in 1953. Salvadori and [[Les Leston]] finished sixth in the same race in DBR1/1. The victory against the full works might of Ferrari and [[Maserati in motorsport|Maserati]] with their [[Ferrari 335 S|335S]] and [[Maserati 450S|450S]] models in the hands of drivers such as [[Peter Collins (racing driver)|Peter Collins]], [[Mike Hawthorn]], Moss and [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] gave the Aston Martin team confidence that they now had a car that could compete against the best in the world. Unfortunately these hopes were dashed at the [[1957 24 Hours of Le Mans]] when both DBR1s failed to finish.  The failure at Le Mans meant that any hopes of the World Championship had gone and Aston Martin missed the final two rounds in Sweden and Venezuela. Instead they entered the non-championship [[Spa Grand Prix]], where DBR1/2 took the only other victory of the year in the hands of Brooks ahead of [[Masten Gregory]] in a [[Ferrari 290 MM]] and [[Olivier Gendebien]] in a Ferrari 335S with Salvadori fourth in DBR1/1.\n\n===1958===\nFor 1958, DBR1/3 was completed and Aston Martin now had three cars with which to compete. The World Sports Car Championship was now restricted to cars of no more than 3-litres and the team's [[Aston Martin DBR2|DBR2]] model with its 3.7-litre engine was ineligible. [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]] therefore chose to concentrate on the Championship with the DBR1, leaving the DBR2 for non-championship races.  The team did not enter the opening round in Buenos Aires which was won by Ferrari, deciding instead to race at the following round, the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. Neither DBR1 managed to finish, both suffering gearbox failure, although in the hands of Moss it was the fastest car in the race. This was followed at the [[Targa Florio]], with the new DBR1/3 also suffering a gearbox failure and not finishing but not before Moss had broken his old lap record set in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SL|Mercedes 300SLR]] by over a minute.  At the 1000&nbsp;km N\u00fcrburgring, where the DBR1 had won the previous year, Aston Martin managed to repeat their victory, with Moss and [[Jack Brabham]]'s DBR1/3 beating a large contingent of [[Ferrari]]s and [[Porsche]]s. Unfortunately the bad luck returned at Le Mans, with all three DBR1s failing to finish again. However, at the season ending Tourist Trophy, Aston Martin managed a 1-2-3 finish with Moss and Brooks driving the winning car (DBR1/2) ahead of Salvadori/Brabham in DBR1/1 and Shelby/[[Stuart Lewis-Evans]] in DBR1/3. However Ferrari had chosen not to compete having already won the championship and the race was only of four hour duration and consequently only half points were awarded. This victory allowed Aston Martin to finish second in the constructor's championship behind Ferrari.\n\n===1959===\n{{Listen|filename=Aston Martin DBR1 (1957).ogg|pos=left|title=Aston Martin DBR1|description=Aston Martin DBR1 at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2009}}\nReturning again for 1959, Aston Martin had completed two more chassis, DBR1/4 and DBR1/5. The first car was actually a conversion from a [[Aston Martin DBR3|DBR3]], while DBR1/5 was a spare chassis sold to privateer [[Graham Whitehead]]. This latter car was the only DBR1 to be sold to a privateer during the 1956-9 period when the factory team campaigned with them.  With four chassis, Aston Martin would again concentrate on the World Sportscar Championship. The season started slowly, with a sole entry, DBR1/1, in the hands of Salvadori and Shelby failing to finish at the [[1959 12 Hours of Sebring|12 Hours of Sebring]] which resulted in a 1-2 for Ferrari with their 250TR model. This was then followed by the team not appearing at the [[Targa Florio]] which was won by Porsche with a 1-2-3-4. Aston Martin then completed a hat trick of victories as the sole factory entry (DBR1/1) again won the [[1959 1000km N\u00fcrburgring|1000km N\u00fcrburgring]], with Moss and [[Jack Fairman]] driving.  In addition to this victory, Aston Martin finally achieved what is considered their finest motorsports triumph. DBR1/2, driven by [[Carroll Shelby]] and Salvadori, took victory at the [[1959 24 Hours of Le Mans]].  DBR1/4, driven by [[Maurice Trintignant]] and [[Paul Fr\u00e9re]], managed second. The next closest competitor was a distant 25 laps behind the duo.\n\nWith the constructors championship now closely contested by Ferrari, Porsche and Aston Martin, the team appeared at the final round, the Tourist Trophy at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]].  Aston Martin entered three DBR1s, as well as privateer Whitehead's DBR1/5. During the race, DBR1/3 which had been leading caught fire whilst refuelling in the pits, damaging the car too badly to continue and leaving Aston Martin without room to refuel their other cars. To salvage Aston Martin's hopes of the championship, Whitehead withdrew his entry from the race in order to allow Aston Martin to use his pits stall and finish the race. Moss took over the car driven by Shelby and Fairman and in DBR1/2 was able to secure victory and the championship. The remaining Aston, DBR1/4, in the hands of Trintignant/Frere came fourth. Aston Martin scored 24 points from their three victories with Ferrari in second place with a net 18 points, 22 gross and Porsche third also with a net 18 points but 21 gross. This was the only World Sports Car Championship won by Aston Martin.\n\n===Privateers===\nFollowing Aston Martin's success in 1959, [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]] decided to make a move to [[Formula One]] with the [[Aston Martin DBR4|DBR4]] and [[Aston Martin DBR5|DBR5]] that ultimately proved unsuccessful. Thus the factory's David Brown Racing Department would no longer compete in sports cars. The four DBR1s retained by the factory, including the rebuilt DBR1/3, were sold off to customers for use in various series.\n\nNotable privateers included [[Border Reivers]], Ian Baille, David Hamm, and Essex Racing Stable. DBR1/3 finished 3rd at 1960 Oulton Park, 3rd at Le Mans driven by Salvadori and [[Jim Clark]], and in 1961, finished 1st at Charterhall driven by Ron Flockhart for the final victory for any DBR1. DBR1/2 won the 1960 Rouen Grand Prix with Fairman. In 1961, two DBR1s failed to finish at Le Mans driven by Salvadori and [[Tony Maggs]] and [[Ron Flockhart (racing driver)|Ron Flockhart]] and Clark. Following the 1962 season, all DBR1s would retire from racing and eventually end up in museums or private collections. DBR1/3 is on display at the [[Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].1956\n\nDBR1/4 is notable for having appeared in the 1959 film adaptation of [[The Sound and the Fury (1959 film)|The Sound and the Fury]].\n\n==Chassis==\n[[File:1957AstonMartinDBR1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aston Martin DBR1/2 at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2009]]\n[[File:DBR1Back.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A rear view of a DBR1 replica at 2006 RM Auctions Monterey.]]\nIncluded are a list of victories by each chassis.\n\n* '''DBR1/1''' \u2013 Completed 1956\n** 1959 1000&nbsp;km N\u00fcrburgring\n* '''DBR1/2''' \u2013 Completed 1957\n** 1957 Spa Sportscar Race\n** 1957 1000&nbsp;km N\u00fcrburgring\n** 1957 Spa Grand Prix\n** 1958 Goodwood Tourist Trophy\n** 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans (overall winner)\n** 1959 Goodwood Tourist Trophy\n** 1960 Rouen Grand Prix (as a privateer)\n* '''DBR1/3''' \u2013 Completed 1958\n** 1958 1000&nbsp;km N\u00fcrburgring - Moss/Jack Brabham (overall winner)\n** 1961 Charterhall - Flockhart (overall winner)\n* '''DBR1/4''' \u2013 Completed 1959 (conversion from DBR3/1)\n** ''None''\n* '''DBR1/5''' \u2013 Completed 1959\n** ''None''\n\n==DBR3==\n{{main|Aston Martin DBR3}}\nAston Martin used a chassis initially meant for the DBR1 to construct a car known as [[Aston Martin DBR3|DBR3]], and given the chassis number DBR3/1. The car was different in that it used Aston Martin's newly designed 3.7-litre (3670cc) Straight-6 from the [[Aston Martin DB4]], downsized to 3.0-litre (2990cc).  The car was used in only a single race in 1958 before it was deemed uncompetitive.  DBR3/1 was thus given a normal Lagonda Straight-6 and rechristened as DBR1/4.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n''Racing With The David Brown Aston Martin's'' by John Wyer {{ISBN|0-85184-036-1}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Aston Martin DBR1}}\n* [http://www.astonmartins.com/racing/dbr1.htm Aston Martin Picture Gallery - DBR1]\n* [http://wspr-racing.com/chassis/aston.htm WSPR Racing - Aston Martin Chassis Numbers]\n\n{{David Brown Ltd.}}\n{{Aston Martin Racing}}\n{{Aston Martin}}\n{{Aston Martin Sportscar Racers}}\n\n[[Category:Aston Martin racing cars|DBR1]]\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans race cars]]\n[[Category:Le Mans winning cars]]\n", "name_user": "Speedy Question Mark", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_DBR1"}
