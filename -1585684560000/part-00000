{"title_page": "Detonation spraying", "text_new": "[[File:Plasma Spraying Process.jpg|thumb|314x314px|Plasma spraying: another thermal spraying technique similar to detonation spraying]]\n'''Detonation spraying''' is one of the many forms of [[thermal spraying]] techniques that are used to apply a protective coating at supersonic velocities to a material in order to change its surface characteristics. This is primarily to improve the [[durability]] of a component. It was first invented in 1955 by H.B. Sargent, R.M. Poorman and H. Lamprey and is applied to a component using a specifically designed detonation gun (D-gun). The component being sprayed must be prepared correctly by removing all surface oils, greases, debris and roughing up the surface in order to achieve a strongly bonded detonation spray coating. This process involves the highest velocities (\u22483500&nbsp;m/s [[Shock wave|shockwave]] that propels the coating materials) and temperatures (\u22484000&nbsp;\u00b0C) of coating materials compared to all other forms of thermal spraying techniques. Which means detonation spraying is able to apply low [[Porosity|porous]] (below 1%) and low [[Oxide|oxygen content]] (between 0.1-0.5%) protective coatings that protect against [[corrosion]], [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] and [[adhesion]] under low load.\n\nThis process allows the application of very hard and dense surface coatings which are useful as [[wear]] resistant coatings. For this reason, detonation spraying is commonly used for protective coatings in aircraft engines, plug and ring gauges, cutting edges (skiving knives), tubular drills, rotor and stator blades, guide rails or any other metallic material that is subject to high wear and tear. Commonly the materials that are sprayed onto components during detonation spraying are powders of metals, metal alloys and [[cermet]]s; as well as their oxides (aluminum, copper, iron, etc.).\n\nDetonation spraying is an industrial process that can be dangerous if not performed correctly and in a safe environment. As such there are many safety precautions that must be adhered to when using this thermal spraying technique.\n\n== History ==\nThe process of detonation spraying was first developed in 1955 by H.B. Sargent, R.M. Poorman and H.

This is an important step because the heat from the residual gases can cause the new fuel mixture to combust which would in turn cause an uncontrollable reaction. Also a small amount of [[Inert gas|inert]] nitrogen gas inserted between the two mixtures of fuel and feedstock prior to firing, helps to prevent backfiring.<ref name=\":0\" /> D-guns typically operate at firing rates of between 1\u201310&nbsp;Hz.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Many different mixtures of coating powders and D-gun settings can be used during detonation gun spraying of a material, all of which influence the final surface characteristics of the sprayed coating.

This means that the surface of the component being sprayed, must be properly prepared so as to maximise the bond strength between the sprayed coating and the substrate. To successfully prepare the surface it must be cleaned of all greases, oils, dirt and other contaminants and sufficiently roughened to provide enough of a surface irregularity for the coating to cling to. Chemical processes are generally the most suitable methods used to clean the substrate surface. After which care must be taken not to touch and/or dirty the surface prior to spraying. The three methods used to roughen up the substrate surface are [[abrasive blasting]], [[machining]] and bond coating. Cleaning occurs only after the roughening of the surface except for when a bond coating is used; the surface must be cleaned before and possibly after this process too.

This is because the detonation gun needs to be able to access the surface to be able to apply an effective coating.\n* The coatings despite being considerably strong in compression are weak under tension, meaning they can't be applied to malleable or expanding components.\n* The coatings tend to fatigue under pinpoint loading.\n*Detonation guns are quite large and loud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041118233643/http://www.aws.org/wj/nov02/feature.html|title=American Welding Society - Welding Journal|date=2004-11-18|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref>\n*Detonation spraying has to be performed at a location specifically designed for it, as the gun is reasonable large and it is a loud process that produces substantial noise. For this reason, it is usually installed in a sound-proof room (with concrete walls 45&nbsp;cm thick).\n*The process involves a considerable amount of mechanisation and automation because the operator can't be in the room whilst the D-gun is in operation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Safety ==\n[[File:Se\u00f1al ruido.JPG|right|125px]]Detonation gun spraying like any other industrial process carries with it a number of safety hazards that need to be managed correctly in order to ensure operator safety whilst in use. These safety precautions primarily fall into the following categories and the hazard minimisation techniques suggested, in some cases have a positive effect on the resultant detonation spray coating. For example, having to automate the spraying process means that a very even and consistent spray coating can be achieved.\n\n=== Noise ===\nThe operation of a detonation gun is a very loud process due to the multiple explosions occurring in the chamber per second. This could cause damage to operators hearing if in close proximity to the D-gun. As a result, detonation spraying should be performed within a sound proof room and no one should be present in the room during operation.<ref name=\":1\" /> Also operators should wear ear protection (such as ear muffs and/or ear plugs) while working with a D-gun.\n\n=== Heat ===\nExtremely high temperatures are reached by the D-gun (\u22484000&nbsp;\u00b0C){{cn|date=August 2019}} whilst in operation. Flammable and explosive fuels (generally [[acetylene]]) are used in detonation spraying to produce the supersonic shockwave that propels the powder coating materials onto their target components. This poses a serious burn and explosion hazard. Again, no-one should be present in the room whilst the D-gun is in operation and the room should be designed to withstand any malfunction of the D-gun. Also protective gloves should be used to handle the D-gun and sprayed components to void burns form hot components after spraying.<ref name=safety>{{cite book|pages = 190\u2013205|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z60qQIg3zXEC| title = Health and safety in welding and allied processes| author = Blunt, Jane and Balchin, N.

Also isolation of the D-gun is recommended to avoid operators breathing in the dangerous dust and fumes.<ref name=annals>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/annhyg/meq052|pmid=20685717|title=Ultrafine Particles Emitted by Flame and Electric Arc Guns for Thermal Spraying of Metals|journal=Annals of Occupational Hygiene|volume=54|issue=6|pages=607\u201314|year=2010|last1=Bemer|first1=D.|last2=Regnier|first2=R.|last3=Subra|first3=I.|last4=Sutter|first4=B.|last5=Lecler|first5=M.

This is primarily to improve the [[durability]] of a component. It was first invented in 1955 by H.B. Sargent, R.M. Poorman and H. Lamprey and is applied to a component using a specifically designed detonation gun (D-gun). The component being sprayed must be prepared correctly by removing all surface oils, greases, debris and roughing up the surface in order to achieve a strongly bonded detonation spray coating. This process involves the highest velocities (\u22483500&nbsp;m/s [[Shock wave|shockwave]] that propels the coating materials) and temperatures (\u22484000&nbsp;\u00b0C) of coating materials compared to all other forms of thermal spraying techniques. Which means detonation spraying is able to apply low [[Porosity|porous]] (below 1%) and low [[Oxide|oxygen content]] (between 0.1-0.5%) protective coatings that protect against [[corrosion]], [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] and [[adhesion]] under low load.\n\nThis process allows the application of very hard and dense surface coatings which are useful as [[wear]] resistant coatings. For this reason, detonation spraying is commonly used for protective coatings in aircraft engines, plug and ring gauges, cutting edges (skiving knives), tubular drills, rotor and stator blades, guide rails or any other metallic material that is subject to high wear and tear. Commonly the materials that are sprayed onto components during detonation spraying are powders of metals, metal alloys and [[cermet]]s; as well as their oxides (aluminum, copper, iron, etc.).\n\nDetonation spraying is an industrial process that can be dangerous if not performed correctly and in a safe environment. As such there are many safety precautions that must be adhered to when using this thermal spraying technique.\n\n== History ==\nThe process of detonation spraying was first developed in 1955 by H.B.

Chemical processes are generally the most suitable methods used to clean the substrate surface. After which care must be taken not to touch and/or dirty the surface prior to spraying. The three methods used to roughen up the substrate surface are [[abrasive blasting]], [[machining]] and bond coating.

This is because the detonation gun needs to be able to access the surface to be able to apply an effective coating.\n* The coatings despite being considerably strong in compression are weak under tension, meaning they can't be applied to malleable or expanding components.\n* The coatings tend to fatigue under pinpoint loading.\n*Detonation guns are quite large and loud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041118233643/http://www.aws.org/wj/nov02/feature.html|title=American Welding Society - Welding Journal|date=2004-11-18|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref>\n*Detonation spraying has to be performed at a location specifically designed for it, as the gun is reasonable large and it is a loud process that produces substantial noise. For this reason, it is usually installed in a sound-proof room (with concrete walls 45&nbsp;cm thick).\n*The process involves a considerable amount of mechanisation and automation because the operator can't be in the room whilst the D-gun is in operation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Safety ==\n[[File:Se\u00f1al ruido.JPG|right|125px]]Detonation gun spraying like any other industrial process carries with it a number of safety hazards that need to be managed correctly in order to ensure operator safety whilst in use. These safety precautions primarily fall into the following categories and the hazard minimisation techniques suggested, in some cases have a positive effect on the resultant detonation spray coating. For example, having to automate the spraying process means that a very even and consistent spray coating can be achieved.\n\n=== Noise ===\nThe operation of a detonation gun is a very loud process due to the multiple explosions occurring in the chamber per second. This could cause damage to operators hearing if in close proximity to the D-gun. As a result, detonation spraying should be performed within a sound proof room and no one should be present in the room during operation.<ref name=\":1\" /> Also operators should wear ear protection (such as ear muffs and/or ear plugs) while working with a D-gun.\n\n=== Heat ===\nExtremely high temperatures are reached by the D-gun (\u22484000&nbsp;\u00b0C){{cn|date=August 2019}} whilst in operation. Flammable and explosive fuels (generally [[acetylene]]) are used in detonation spraying to produce the supersonic shockwave that propels the powder coating materials onto their target components. This poses a serious burn and explosion hazard. Again, no-one should be present in the room whilst the D-gun is in operation and the room should be designed to withstand any malfunction of the D-gun. Also protective gloves should be used to handle the D-gun and sprayed components to void burns form hot components after spraying.<ref name=safety>{{cite book|pages = 190\u2013205|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z60qQIg3zXEC| title = Health and safety in welding and allied processes| author = Blunt, Jane and Balchin, N.

This means proper extraction facilities are required for inhalation safety purposes. Also isolation of the D-gun is recommended to avoid operators breathing in the dangerous dust and fumes.<ref name=annals>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/annhyg/meq052|pmid=20685717|title=Ultrafine Particles Emitted by Flame and Electric Arc Guns for Thermal Spraying of Metals|journal=Annals of Occupational Hygiene|volume=54|issue=6|pages=607\u201314|year=2010|last1=Bemer|first1=D.|last2=Regnier|first2=R.|last3=Subra|first3=I.|last4=Sutter|first4=B.|last5=Lecler|first5=M.

Many of the compounds used as the feedstock in detonation spraying are detrimental to human health if ingested or inhaled.

Symptoms range from isolated bone lesions to [[systemic disease|multisystem disease]]. LCH is part of a group of syndromes called [[Histiocytosis|histiocytoses]], which are characterized by an abnormal proliferation of [[histiocyte]]s (an archaic term for activated [[dendritic cell]]s and [[macrophage]]s). These diseases are related to other forms of abnormal proliferation of [[white blood cell]]s, such as [[leukemia]]s and [[lymphoma]]s.\n\nThe cancer has gone by several names, including [[Hand\u2013Sch\u00fcller\u2013Christian disease]], '''Abt-Letterer-Siwe disease''', '''Hashimoto-Pritzker disease''' (a very rare self-limiting variant seen at birth) and '''histiocytosis X''', until it was renamed in 1985 by the [[Histiocyte Society]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=The Writing Group of the Histiocyte Society |title=Histiocytosis syndromes in children.

Described as a \"Sega simulation\", the player takes control of Tar\u014d Sega, who must help save a struggling Sega from losing the console market to its rival DOGMA, who owns 97%. Gameplay involves battling employees and other characters throughout various Sega development studios, some being taken from older Sega game franchises. It features many tongue-in-cheek references to Sega and the video game industry, particularly Sony and its [[PlayStation 2]] console.\n\nDevelopment was directed by Tez Okano, who developed the game in secret for two years before presenting it to Sega. The company misconstrued the game as a joke at first and dismissed it, however a second presentation impressed them and allowed development to continue. Okano marketed the game himself with a small budget of $200, half of which he spent on a wrestling mask to promote the game. Several characters, such as [[Segata Sanshiro]] and a [[Ferrari]] from ''[[Out Run]]'', had to be cut for licensing issues. [[Toei Animation]] produced the game's animated cutscenes. The game was initially exclusive to the Sega Direct online service, its popularity eventually warranting a physical release. The budget was small, with Okano claiming it was \"less than a hundredth\" of ''[[Shenmue]]''.\n\n''Segagaga'' received a favorable reception from critics, being commended for its humor, gameplay and bizarre nature, alongside its usage of various Sega franchises and for poking fun at the industry itself. One critic labeled the game as the \"swan song\" of the Dreamcast. It is one of the last games released for the system, published two days before its discontinuation on March 31.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:SegagagaBattle.jpg|thumb|left|In-game screenshot, showing the player fighting Amigo from ''[[Samba de Amigo]]''.]]\n''Segagaga'' is a role-playing simulation video game, described as a \"Sega simulation\".<ref name=\"HG101\"/> Controlling the young Sega Tar\u014d, the player is tasked with saving a struggling Sega from losing the console market to their rival DOGMA.<ref name=\"Edge Interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/story-sega%C3%ADs-oddest-game-ever |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813160653/http://www.edge-online.com/magazine/the-story-sega%E2%80%99s-oddest-game-ever?page=0%2C0 |title=The Story of Sega\u2019s Oddest Game Ever |author=Edge Staff |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |date=21 July 2008 |archivedate=August 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2008-07-26}}</ref> The player must progress through various Sega development studios and fight various employees, who due to the stress and pressure brought on by tight work constraints have turned into mutants.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> Unlike other role-playing games, Tar\u014d \"attacks\" by shouting verbal abuses and insults, such as telling them their game is terrible or they will never get a girlfriend.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> Enemies have a \"will meter\" that weakens as the player deals more insults towards them, and will win the fight once it fully drains.

Described as a \"Sega simulation\", the player takes control of Tar\u014d Sega, who must help save a struggling Sega from losing the console market to its rival DOGMA, who owns 97%. Gameplay involves battling employees and other characters throughout various Sega development studios, some being taken from older Sega game franchises. It features many tongue-in-cheek references to Sega and the video game industry, particularly Sony and its [[PlayStation 2]] console.\n\nDevelopment was directed by Tez Okano, who developed the game in secret for two years before presenting it to Sega. The company misconstrued the game as a joke at first and dismissed it, however a second presentation impressed them and allowed development to continue. Okano marketed the game himself with a small budget of $200, half of which he spent on a wrestling mask to promote the game. Several characters, such as [[Segata Sanshiro]] and a [[Ferrari]] from ''[[Out Run]]'', had to be cut for licensing issues. [[Toei Animation]] produced the game's animated cutscenes. The game was initially exclusive to the Sega Direct online service, its popularity eventually warranting a physical release. The budget was small, with Okano claiming it was \"less than a hundredth\" of ''[[Shenmue]]''.\n\n''Segagaga'' received a favorable reception from critics, being commended for its humor, gameplay and bizarre nature, alongside its usage of various Sega franchises and for poking fun at the industry itself. One critic labeled the game as the \"swan song\" of the Dreamcast.

Patients with SCA13 also tend to present with [[epilepsy]], an inability to run, and increased reflexes. This cerebellar dysfunction is permanent and progressive. SCA13 is caused by mutations in [[KCNC3]], a gene encoding a [[voltage-gated potassium channel]] K<sub>V</sub>3.3. There are two known mutations in this gene causative for SCA13. Unlike many other types of SCA, these are not polyglutamine expansions but, rather, point mutations resulting in channels with no current or altered kinetics.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSCA13 is typified by early onset, mildly progressive cerebellar ataxia with accompanying [[dysarthria]], [[mental retardation]], and [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]]. Symptoms and age of onset can vary slightly according to the causative mutation.<ref name=\"Herman-Bert_2000\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Herman-Bert A, Stevanin G, Netter J, Rascol O, Brassat D, Calvas P, Camuzat A, Yuan Q, Schalling M, D\u00fcrr A, Brice A | title = Mapping of spinocerebellar ataxia 13 to chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4 in a family with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia and mental retardation. | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 229\u201335 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10820125 | doi = 10.1086/302958 | pmc = 1287081}}</ref><ref name=\"Waters_2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Waters M, Fee D, Figueroa K, Nolte D, M\u00fcller U, Advincula J, Coon H, Evidente V, Pulst S | title = An autosomal dominant ataxia maps to 19q13: Allelic heterogeneity of SCA13 or novel locus? | journal = Neurology | volume = 65 | issue = 7 | pages = 1111\u20133 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16135769 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000177490.05162.41}}</ref>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nMutations in KCNC3 are responsible for SCA13. This gene is expressed heavily in [[Purkinje cell]]s, as is the case for some other SCA subtypes, where it is believed to play an important role in facilitating high-frequency [[action potential]] firing.

Patients with SCA13 also tend to present with [[epilepsy]], an inability to run, and increased reflexes. This cerebellar dysfunction is permanent and progressive. SCA13 is caused by mutations in [[KCNC3]], a gene encoding a [[voltage-gated potassium channel]] K<sub>V</sub>3.3. There are two known mutations in this gene causative for SCA13. Unlike many other types of SCA, these are not polyglutamine expansions but, rather, point mutations resulting in channels with no current or altered kinetics.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSCA13 is typified by early onset, mildly progressive cerebellar ataxia with accompanying [[dysarthria]], [[mental retardation]], and [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]].

There is a wide variation between individuals in the symptoms experienced as well as the rate of deterioration in vision. [[Peripheral vision]] is usually less affected than fine, central ([[foveal]]) vision.\n\n==Genetics==\nHistorically from Stargardt\u2019s first description of his eponymous disease until recently, the diagnosis was based on looking at the [[phenotype]] using examination and investigation of the eye. Since the advent of [[genotype|genetic testing]], the picture has become more complex. What was thought to be one disease is, in fact, probably at least three different diseases, each related to a different genetic change. Therefore it is currently a little confusing to define what Stargardt's disease is. It is certainly caused by defects in the ABCA4 gene, but whether changes to other genes such as PROM1 or ELOVL4, or [[missense mutation]]s play a role remains to be seen.\n\nThe carrier frequency in the general population of ABCA4 alleles is 5 to 10%.<ref>Yatsenko et al. 2001</ref> Different combinations of ABCA4 genes will result in widely different age of onset and retinal pathology. The severity of the disease is inversely proportional to ABCA4 function and it is thought that ABCA4 related disease has a role to play in other diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophies and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).<ref name=\"eyewiki.aao.org\">{{Cite web | url=http://eyewiki.aao.org/Stargardt_disease/Fundus_flavimaculatus |title = Stargardt disease/Fundus flavimaculatus - EyeWiki}}</ref>\n\n* STGD1: By far the most common form of Stargardt disease is the [[recessive]] form caused by mutations in the [[ABCA4]] gene.<ref>http://omim.org/entry/601691</ref>\n* STGD4:  A rare [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] defect in the PROM1 gene.<ref>http://omim.org/entry/604365</ref><ref name=\"eyewiki.aao.org\"/>\n* STGD3:  A rare [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] form of Stargardt disease caused by mutations in the [[ELOVL4]] gene.\n*Late-onset Stargardt disease is associated with [[missense]] mutations outside known functional domains of ABCA4.<ref name=\"eyewiki.aao.org\"/>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nIn STGD1, the genetic defect causes malfunction of the [[ATP-binding cassette transporter]] (ABCA4) protein of the [[visual phototransduction]] cycle. Defective ABCA4 leads to improper shuttling of vitamin A throughout the retina, and accelerated formation of toxic vitamin A dimers (also known as bisretinoids), and associated degradation byproducts. Vitamin A dimers and other byproducts are widely accepted as the cause of STGD1. As such, slowing the formation of vitamin A dimers might lead to a treatment for Stargardt. When vitamin A dimers and byproducts damage the retinal cells, fluorescent granules called [[lipofuscin]] in the [[retinal pigmented epithelium]] of the retina<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Adler L|first1=4th|last2=Boyer|first2=NP|last3=Chen|first3=C|last4=Ablonczy|first4=Z|last5=Crouch|first5=RK|last6=Koutalos|first6=Y|title=The 11-cis Retinal Origins of Lipofuscin in the Retina|journal=Progress in Molecular Biology and Translational Science|date=2015|volume=134|pages=e1\u201312|doi=10.1016/bs.pmbts.2015.07.022|pmid=26310175|isbn=9780128010594}}</ref> appear, as a reflecting such damage.\n\nIn STGD4, a butterfly pattern of [[dystrophy]] is caused by mutations in a gene that encodes a membrane bound protein that is involved in the elongation of [[very long chain fatty acid]]s ([[ELOVL4]])<ref name=\":0\">Deutman, August; Hoyng, Carol; van Lith-Verhoeven, Janneke (2006). \"Macular dystrophies\". ''Retina'' (4 ed.). Elsevier Mosby. pp. 1171-4.</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis is firstly clinical through history and examination usually with a [[Slit lamp|Slit-lamp]]. If characteristic features are found the investigations undertaken will depend on locally available equipment and may include [[Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy]] which highlights areas of [[autofluorescence]] which are associated with retinal pathology. [[Optical coherence tomography|Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography]], [[electroretinography]] and [[microperimetry]] are also useful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. These investigations may be followed by genetic testing but this is not essential until treatment is available. [[Fluorescein angiography]] is used less often than in the past.\n\n==Treatment==\nAt present there is no treatment. However, ophthalmologists recommend measures that could slow the rate of progression of the disease. There are no [[Clinical study design|prospective clinical trials]] to support the recommendations but they are based on scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disease pathology.  There are three strategies doctors recommend for potential harm reduction: reducing retinal exposure to damaging ultra [[violet light]],  avoiding foods rich in [[Vitamin A]] with the hope of lowering [[lipofuscin]] accumulation and maintaining good general health and diet.\n\nUltra-violet light has more energy and is more damaging colour than visible light. In an effort to mitigate this, some ophthalmologists may recommend that the patient wears a broad-brimmed hat or sunglasses when they are outdoors. Sometimes, doctors also instruct their patients to wear yellow-tinted glasses (which filter out blue light) when indoors and in artificial light or in front of a digital screen. \n\nFoods, especially carrots, and vitamin supplements rich in vitamin A are considered to be harmful. Foods with a high vitamin A content are often yellow or orange in color, such as squash, pumpkin, and sweet potato but some, such as liver, are not. \n\nSmoking, being overweight, and eating unhealthily may also contribute to more rapid degeneration. On the other hand, the consumption of oily fish, in a diet similar to that which doctors recommend for [[Macular degeneration|age related macular degeneration]], can be used to slow the progression of the disease.\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe long-term prognosis for patients with Stargardt disease is widely variable and depends on the age of onset and genetic [[alleles]].

The hope is to return cell function back to normal and the treatment has the potential to stop disease progression. This therapy will not restore impaired vision back to normal.  The research is being undertaken by a partnership between [[Sanofi]] and [[Oxford BioMedica]].

Symptoms typically develop before age 20 (median age of onset: ~17 years old),<ref name=\"aao.org\">{{cite web|url=http://eyewiki.aao.org/Stargardt_disease/Fundus_flavimaculatus|title=Stargardt disease/Fundus flavimaculatus - EyeWiki|website=eyewiki.aao.org|accessdate=5 February 2018}}</ref> and include: wavy vision, [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spots]], [[Visual impairment|blurriness]], [[depth perception|loss of depth perception]], sensitivity to glare, [[Color blindness|impaired colour vision]],<ref name=\"aao.org\"/> and [[Purkinje effect|difficulty adapting to dim lighting]] (delayed dark adaptation). There is a wide variation between individuals in the symptoms experienced as well as the rate of deterioration in vision. [[Peripheral vision]] is usually less affected than fine, central ([[foveal]]) vision.\n\n==Genetics==\nHistorically from Stargardt\u2019s first description of his eponymous disease until recently, the diagnosis was based on looking at the [[phenotype]] using examination and investigation of the eye. Since the advent of [[genotype|genetic testing]], the picture has become more complex. What was thought to be one disease is, in fact, probably at least three different diseases, each related to a different genetic change. Therefore it is currently a little confusing to define what Stargardt's disease is. It is certainly caused by defects in the ABCA4 gene, but whether changes to other genes such as PROM1 or ELOVL4, or [[missense mutation]]s play a role remains to be seen.\n\nThe carrier frequency in the general population of ABCA4 alleles is 5 to 10%.<ref>Yatsenko et al. 2001</ref> Different combinations of ABCA4 genes will result in widely different age of onset and retinal pathology. The severity of the disease is inversely proportional to ABCA4 function and it is thought that ABCA4 related disease has a role to play in other diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophies and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).<ref name=\"eyewiki.aao.org\">{{Cite web | url=http://eyewiki.aao.org/Stargardt_disease/Fundus_flavimaculatus |title = Stargardt disease/Fundus flavimaculatus - EyeWiki}}</ref>\n\n* STGD1: By far the most common form of Stargardt disease is the [[recessive]] form caused by mutations in the [[ABCA4]] gene.<ref>http://omim.org/entry/601691</ref>\n* STGD4:  A rare [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] defect in the PROM1 gene.<ref>http://omim.org/entry/604365</ref><ref name=\"eyewiki.aao.org\"/>\n* STGD3:  A rare [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] form of Stargardt disease caused by mutations in the [[ELOVL4]] gene.\n*Late-onset Stargardt disease is associated with [[missense]] mutations outside known functional domains of ABCA4.<ref name=\"eyewiki.aao.org\"/>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nIn STGD1, the genetic defect causes malfunction of the [[ATP-binding cassette transporter]] (ABCA4) protein of the [[visual phototransduction]] cycle. Defective ABCA4 leads to improper shuttling of vitamin A throughout the retina, and accelerated formation of toxic vitamin A dimers (also known as bisretinoids), and associated degradation byproducts. Vitamin A dimers and other byproducts are widely accepted as the cause of STGD1. As such, slowing the formation of vitamin A dimers might lead to a treatment for Stargardt. When vitamin A dimers and byproducts damage the retinal cells, fluorescent granules called [[lipofuscin]] in the [[retinal pigmented epithelium]] of the retina<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Adler L|first1=4th|last2=Boyer|first2=NP|last3=Chen|first3=C|last4=Ablonczy|first4=Z|last5=Crouch|first5=RK|last6=Koutalos|first6=Y|title=The 11-cis Retinal Origins of Lipofuscin in the Retina|journal=Progress in Molecular Biology and Translational Science|date=2015|volume=134|pages=e1\u201312|doi=10.1016/bs.pmbts.2015.07.022|pmid=26310175|isbn=9780128010594}}</ref> appear, as a reflecting such damage.\n\nIn STGD4, a butterfly pattern of [[dystrophy]] is caused by mutations in a gene that encodes a membrane bound protein that is involved in the elongation of [[very long chain fatty acid]]s ([[ELOVL4]])<ref name=\":0\">Deutman, August; Hoyng, Carol; van Lith-Verhoeven, Janneke (2006). \"Macular dystrophies\". ''Retina'' (4 ed.). Elsevier Mosby. pp. 1171-4.</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis is firstly clinical through history and examination usually with a [[Slit lamp|Slit-lamp]]. If characteristic features are found the investigations undertaken will depend on locally available equipment and may include [[Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy]] which highlights areas of [[autofluorescence]] which are associated with retinal pathology. [[Optical coherence tomography|Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography]], [[electroretinography]] and [[microperimetry]] are also useful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. These investigations may be followed by genetic testing but this is not essential until treatment is available. [[Fluorescein angiography]] is used less often than in the past.\n\n==Treatment==\nAt present there is no treatment. However, ophthalmologists recommend measures that could slow the rate of progression of the disease. There are no [[Clinical study design|prospective clinical trials]] to support the recommendations but they are based on scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disease pathology.  There are three strategies doctors recommend for potential harm reduction: reducing retinal exposure to damaging ultra [[violet light]],  avoiding foods rich in [[Vitamin A]] with the hope of lowering [[lipofuscin]] accumulation and maintaining good general health and diet.\n\nUltra-violet light has more energy and is more damaging colour than visible light. In an effort to mitigate this, some ophthalmologists may recommend that the patient wears a broad-brimmed hat or sunglasses when they are outdoors. Sometimes, doctors also instruct their patients to wear yellow-tinted glasses (which filter out blue light) when indoors and in artificial light or in front of a digital screen. \n\nFoods, especially carrots, and vitamin supplements rich in vitamin A are considered to be harmful. Foods with a high vitamin A content are often yellow or orange in color, such as squash, pumpkin, and sweet potato but some, such as liver, are not. \n\nSmoking, being overweight, and eating unhealthily may also contribute to more rapid degeneration. On the other hand, the consumption of oily fish, in a diet similar to that which doctors recommend for [[Macular degeneration|age related macular degeneration]], can be used to slow the progression of the disease.\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe long-term prognosis for patients with Stargardt disease is widely variable and depends on the age of onset and genetic [[alleles]].  The majority of people will progress to legal blindness.<ref name=Yanoff>{{cite book|last1=Yanoff|first1=Myron|last2=Duker|first2=Jay S.|title=Ophthalmology|year=2008|publisher=Mosby|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0323057516|pages=560\u2013562|edition=3rd|ref=harv}}</ref> Stargardt disease has no impact on general health and life expectancy is normal.<ref>[http://disorders.eyes.arizona.edu/handouts/stargardt-disease Stargardt Disease] from The University of Arizona College of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science.

In general all are testing the safety and benefits of their respective therapies in [[Clinical study design|phase I or II trials]]. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dose and effectiveness in small number of people in Phase I with Phase II evaluating similar criteria in a larger population but including a greater insight into potential side effects. \n\nGene therapy is designed to insert a copy of a corrected gene into retinal cells.  The hope is to return cell function back to normal and the treatment has the potential to stop disease progression. This therapy will not restore impaired vision back to normal.  The research is being undertaken by a partnership between [[Sanofi]] and [[Oxford BioMedica]]. A [[Lentiviral vector]] is used to deliverer normal genes to the eye via a [[retina|subretinal]] injection. The therapy is known as SAR422459 and it is in Phase I/II trials at present (2018).<ref>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01367444?term=SAR422459&rank=1</ref>\n\n[[Stem-cell therapy]] involves injecting cells with the potential to mature into [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated]] and functioning retinal cells. This therapy has the potential stop disease progression and in the long term improve vision.  To improve vision this technique will need to replicate the complex multi-layered and [[neurone|neurally]]  anatomy of the [[retina]].

In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the ''Daily Mail'' and ''News of the World'', particularly [[Andy Coulson]], had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from [[Margaret Thatcher]] onwards had cultivated a close relationship with [[Rupert Murdoch]] and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between [[David Cameron]] and [[Rebekah Brooks]] (n\u00e9e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: \"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament \u2013 that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nWhen asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] to \"drag their feet\" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: \"20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nGrant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of his \"turning the tables\" on a tabloid journalist.<ref name=\"Guardian-2011-04-16\" />\n\nWhilst the allegations regarding the ''News of the World'' continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on [[BBC Radio 4]]) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered [[Millie Dowler]] had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], culminating in an appearance on [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' in July 2011.<ref name=\"guardian-2011-07-08\" />\n\nGrant said: \"It's been fascinating to have a little excursion into another world.

In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the ''Daily Mail'' and ''News of the World'', particularly [[Andy Coulson]], had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from [[Margaret Thatcher]] onwards had cultivated a close relationship with [[Rupert Murdoch]] and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between [[David Cameron]] and [[Rebekah Brooks]] (n\u00e9e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: \"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament \u2013 that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nWhen asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] to \"drag their feet\" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: \"20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nGrant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of his \"turning the tables\" on a tabloid journalist.<ref name=\"Guardian-2011-04-16\" />\n\nWhilst the allegations regarding the ''News of the World'' continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on [[BBC Radio 4]]) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered [[Millie Dowler]] had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], culminating in an appearance on [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' in July 2011.<ref name=\"guardian-2011-07-08\" />\n\nGrant said: \"It's been fascinating to have a little excursion into another world.

After his victory at the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]], [[Sterling Price]] and the [[Missouri State Guard]] moved further north into [[Missouri]].  A force of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops under [[James H. Lane (Senator)|James H. Lane]] moved from [[Fort Scott, Kansas]] to attempt to intercept Price's army, and set an ambush along [[Dry Wood Creek]] in Vernon County.  Price's Missouri State Guard troops outnumbered Lane's [[Kansas]] troops, and forced Lane to retreat to Fort Scott after a two hour skirmish.  In their retreat, Lane's troops were forced to abandon their supplies and mules to the Missourians. Price followed up his victory by continuing his northward march, culminating in the [[Siege of Lexington]].\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Missouri in the American Civil War}}\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]], in which the [[Missouri State Guard]] under [[Major General]] [[Sterling Price]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] troops under [[Benjamin McCulloch]] defeated a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] army led by [[Nathaniel Lyon]], the Union army retreated to [[Rolla, Missouri]] and Price's Missouri State Guard occupied [[Springfield, Missouri]].  McCulloch's troops, operating independent from Price, withdrew to [[Arkansas]].{{sfn|Monaghan|1984|p=182}}  [[John C. Fremont]] arrived to take control of Union forces in the state, and [[James H.

Price then brought up more troops, and the Missourians' numerical advantage was a deciding factor in the engagement.  Lane's [[skirmishers]] were driven back from an advanced position, and the main Union force used the covers of the woods to hold of Price for about two hours.  However, Price's men eventually gained the better of the Kansans, and Lane's troops retreated to Fort Scott.  During the retreat, Lane's men abandoned their supplies and mules to the Missouri State Guard.  Price stated that an important factor in the victory was the fighting experience the Missouri State Guard had gained at Wilson's Creek.{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|pp=99\u2013100}}  The capture of the mules led the battle to be sometimes known as the \"Battle of the Mules\".<ref name=\"ohio state\" /> After defeating Lane, Price's army then headed north to [[Johnson County, Missouri]].{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|p=100}}\n\nIn a report filed after the battle, Lane states that his forces lost five men killed and six wounded.<ref name=\"lane battle report\">{{cite web |last1=Lane |first1=James H. |title=Action at Dry Wood Creek |url=https://ehistory.osu.edu/books/official-records/003/0163 |website=ehistory.osu.edu |publisher=Ohio State University |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>  In his post-action report, Price estimated his loss to be two men killed and twenty-three wounded, although he noted that most of the wounds were not serious.<ref name=\"official records\">{{cite web |title=The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies: Series 1, Volume 53 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924080779543&view=1up&seq=443 |website=babel.hathitrust.org |publisher=United States War Department |accessdate=16 March 2020 |pages=435{{endash}}436}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\nAfter reaching Johnson County, Price continued to [[Lexington, Missouri]], where a Union garrison was defending the town.

After his victory at the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]], [[Sterling Price]] and the [[Missouri State Guard]] moved further north into [[Missouri]].  A force of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops under [[James H. Lane (Senator)|James H. Lane]] moved from [[Fort Scott, Kansas]] to attempt to intercept Price's army, and set an ambush along [[Dry Wood Creek]] in Vernon County.  Price's Missouri State Guard troops outnumbered Lane's [[Kansas]] troops, and forced Lane to retreat to Fort Scott after a two hour skirmish.  In their retreat, Lane's troops were forced to abandon their supplies and mules to the Missourians. Price followed up his victory by continuing his northward march, culminating in the [[Siege of Lexington]].\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Missouri in the American Civil War}}\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]], in which the [[Missouri State Guard]] under [[Major General]] [[Sterling Price]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] troops under [[Benjamin McCulloch]] defeated a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] army led by [[Nathaniel Lyon]], the Union army retreated to [[Rolla, Missouri]] and Price's Missouri State Guard occupied [[Springfield, Missouri]].  McCulloch's troops, operating independent from Price, withdrew to [[Arkansas]].{{sfn|Monaghan|1984|p=182}}  [[John C. Fremont]] arrived to take control of Union forces in the state, and [[James H. Lane (Senator)|James H. Lane]] took command of several [[Kansas]] regiments stationed at [[Fort Scott, Kansas|Fort Scott]].  Meanwhile, Price began to advance north with a force estimated to number between 6,000<ref name=\"ohio state\">{{cite web |title=Dry Wood Creek (Big Dry Wood Creek, Battle of the Mules) |url=https://ehistory.osu.edu/battles/dry-wood-creek-big-dry-wood-creek-battle-mules |website=ehistory.osu |publisher=Ohio State University |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref> and 10,000.{{sfn|Monaghan|1984|p=184}}  In response to Price's incursion, Fremont declared Missouri to be subject to [[martial law]].{{sfn|Monaghan|1984|pp=182\u2013185}}\n\n==Battle==\nLane sent his forces, estimated to number between 600<ref name=\"ohio state\" /> and 1,200, out to intercept Price's army, and set an ambush along [[Dry Wood Creek]] in [[Vernon County, Missouri]].{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|p=99}}  Lane used the cover of a small wooded area, and ambushed the leading portions of the Missouri State Guard.  Price then brought up more troops, and the Missourians' numerical advantage was a deciding factor in the engagement.  Lane's [[skirmishers]] were driven back from an advanced position, and the main Union force used the covers of the woods to hold of Price for about two hours.  However, Price's men eventually gained the better of the Kansans, and Lane's troops retreated to Fort Scott.  During the retreat, Lane's men abandoned their supplies and mules to the Missouri State Guard.  In Price's opinion, an important factor in the victory was the fighting experience the Missouri State Guard had gained at Wilson's Creek.{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|pp=99\u2013100}}  The capture of the mules led the battle to be sometimes known as the \"Battle of the Mules\".<ref name=\"ohio state\" /> After defeating Lane, Price's army then headed north to [[Johnson County, Missouri]].{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|p=100}}\n\nIn a report filed after the battle, Lane states that his forces lost five men killed and six wounded.<ref name=\"lane battle report\">{{cite web |last1=Lane |first1=James H. |title=Action at Dry Wood Creek |url=https://ehistory.osu.edu/books/official-records/003/0163 |website=ehistory.osu.edu |publisher=Ohio State University |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>  In his post-action report, Price estimated his loss to be two men killed and twenty-three wounded, although he noted that most of the wounds were not serious.<ref name=\"official records\">{{cite web |title=The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies: Series 1, Volume 53 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924080779543&view=1up&seq=443 |website=babel.hathitrust.org |publisher=United States War Department |accessdate=16 March 2020 |pages=435{{endash}}436}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\nAfter reaching Johnson County, Price continued to [[Lexington, Missouri]], where a Union garrison was defending the town.  Price's men surrounded the garrison, initiating the [[Siege of Lexington]].  The Missouri State Guard subdued the Union garrison, at one point using [[hemp]] bales as cover while attacking uphill.  After forcing the Union garrison to surrender, the Missouri State Guard remained in the Lexington area for two weeks before Price ordered the unit to return south.{{sfn|Monaghan|1984|pp=185\u2013194}}\n\nToday, the site of the battle is commemorated with a series of markers near [[Deerfield, Missouri]].
