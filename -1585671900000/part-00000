{"title_page": "Conversation", "text_new": "{{About|human communication|other uses|Conversation (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n[[File:Arnold Lakhovsky Conversation.png|thumb|right|[[Arnold Lakhovsky]], ''The Conversation'' (circa 1935)]] '''Conversation''' is interactive [[communication]] between two or more people.\n\nThe development of conversational skills and [[etiquette]] is an important part of [[socialization]]. The development of conversational skills in a new language is a frequent focus of [[language teaching]] and [[language learning|learning]].\n\n[[Conversation analysis]] is a branch of sociology which studies the structure and organization of human interaction, with a more specific focus on conversational interaction.\n\n==Definition and characterization==\nNo generally accepted definition of conversation exists, beyond the fact that a conversation involves at least two people talking together.{{sfn|Warren|2006|p=8}}  Consequently, the term is often defined by what it is not. A ritualized exchange such as a mutual [[greeting]] is not a conversation, and an interaction that includes a marked status differential (such as a boss giving orders) is also not a conversation.{{sfn|Warren|2006|pp=8\u20139}}  An interaction with a tightly focused topic or purpose is also generally not considered a conversation.{{sfn|Warren|2006|p=9}}  Summarizing these properties, one authority writes that \"Conversation is the kind of speech that happens informally, symmetrically, and for the purposes of establishing and maintaining social ties.\"{{sfn|Thornbury|Slade|2006|p=25}}\n\nFrom a less technical perspective, a writer on etiquette in the early 20th century defined conversation as the polite give and take of subjects thought of by people talking with each other for company.<ref>Conklin, Mary Greer. 1738. ''Conversation: What to Say and How to Say It,'' pp. 21\u201332. New York and London: Funk & Wagnalls Company.</ref>\n\nConversations follow rules of etiquette because conversations are social interactions, and therefore depend on social convention. Specific rules for conversation arise from the [[cooperative principle]].  Failure to adhere to these rules causes the conversation to deteriorate or eventually to end. Contributions to a conversation are responses to what has previously been said.\n\nConversations may be the optimal form of [[communication]], depending on the participants' intended ends. Conversations may be ideal when, for example, each party desires a relatively equal exchange of information, or when the parties desire to build social ties. On the other hand, if permanency or the ability to review such information is important, written communication may be ideal. Or if time-efficient communication is most important, a speech may be preferable.\n\nConversation involves a lot more nuanced and implied context that lies beneath just the words.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(72)90002-3 |title=Understanding natural language |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1\u2013191 |year=1972 |last1=Winograd |first1=Terry }}</ref>\n\nConversation is generally face-to-face person-to-person at the same time (synchronous) \u2013 possibly online with video applications such as Skype, but might also include audio-only phone calls.  It would not generally include internet written communication which tends to be asynchronous (not same time \u2013 can read and respond later if at all) and does not fit the 'con'='with' in 'conversation'.  In face to face conversation it has been suggested that 85% of the communication is non-verbal/body language \u2013 a smile, a frown, a shrug, tone of voice conveying much added meaning to the mere words.  Short forms of written communication such as sms are thus frequently misunderstood.  Yet the convenience and apparent control makes them increasingly popular now that many people seem to prefer to communicate via short text or Facebook post and/or 'like' than actually meeting face to face.\n\nFace to face conversation is increasingly deemed less important when people have already seen all the relevant news about the other person they have already shared online.  Also people would typically never say face to face some things they might easily write with the apparent impunity of anonymous online posts.  To this extent the decreasing popularity of face to face conversation can be seen as a loss to society and civility.\n\n==Classification==\n\n=== Banter ===\n{{Redirect|Banter|the BBC radio show|Banter (radio show)}}\nBanter is short witty sentences that bounce back and forth between individuals. Often banter uses clever put-downs and witty insults, misunderstandings (often intentional), zippy wisecracks, zingers, flirtation, and puns. The idea is each line of banter should \"top\" the one before it and in short a verbal war of wit without any physical contact.\n\nFilms that have used banter as a way of structure in conversations are:\n* [[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|''The Big Sleep'' (1946)]]\n* [[His Girl Friday|''His Girl Friday'' (1940)]]\n* [[Bringing Up Baby|''Bringing Up Baby'' (1938)]]\n\nImportant factors in delivering a banter is the subtext, situation and the rapport with the person. Every line in a banter should be able to evoke both an emotional response and ownership without hurting one's feelings. Following a structure that the involved parties understand is important, even if the subject and structure is absurd, a certain level of progression should be kept in a manner that it connects with the involved parties.\n\nDifferent methods of story telling could be used in delivering banter, like making an unexpected turn in the flow of structure (interrupting a comfortable structure), taking the conversation towards an expected crude form with evoking questions, doubts, self-conscientiousness (creating intentional misunderstandings) or layering the existing pattern with multiple anchors...etc. It is important to quit the bantering with the sensibility of playground rules, both parties shouldn't obsess on topping each other, continuously after a certain point of interest. It is as Shakespeare said \"Brevity is the soul of wit.\"<ref>William C. Martell, 2011{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Discussion ===\nOne element of conversation is discussion: sharing opinions on subjects that are thought of during the conversation. In polite society the subject changes before discussion becomes dispute or [[controversy|controversial]]. For example, if theology is being ''discussed'', maybe no one is insisting a particular view be accepted.<ref>Conklin, Mary Greer (1912). ''Conversation: What to Say and How to Say It''. pp. 35\u201360 New York and London: Funk & Wagnalls Company.</ref>\n\n===Subject===\nMany conversations can be divided into four categories according to their major subject content:\n* '''Subjective ideas''', which often serve to extend understanding and awareness.\n* '''Objective facts''', which may serve to consolidate a widely held view.\n* '''Other people''' (usually absent), which may be either [[criticism|critical]], competitive, or supportive. This includes [[gossip]].\n* '''Oneself''', which sometimes indicate [[attention-seeking]] behavior or can provide relevant information about oneself to participants in the conversation.\n\nPractically, few conversations fall exclusively into one category. Nevertheless, the proportional distribution of any given conversation between the categories can offer useful psychological insights into the mind set of the participants. This is the reason that the majority of conversations are difficult to categorize.\n\n===Functions===\nMost conversations may be classified by their goal.  Conversational ends may shift over the life of the conversation.\n* '''Functional conversation''' is designed to convey information in order to help achieve an individual or group goal.\n* '''[[Small talk]]''' is a type of conversation where the topic is less important than the social purpose of achieving [[human bonding|bonding]] between people or managing [[personal distance]], such as 'how is the weather' might be portrayed as an example, which conveys no practicality whatsoever.\n\n==Aspects==\n\n===Differences between men and women===\n\nA study completed in July 2007 by Matthias Mehl of the [[University of Arizona]] shows that contrary to popular belief, there is little difference in the number of words used by men and women in conversation.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1139940 |pmid=17615349 |lay-url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12203-men--the-other-talkative-sex.html |laysource=New Scientist |laydate=July 6, 2007 |title=Are Women Really More Talkative Than Men? |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5834 |page=82 |year=2007 |last1=Mehl |first1=M.

In such situations strangers are likely to share intimate personal information they would not ordinarily share with strangers. A special case emerges when one of the travelers is a mental health professional and the other party shares details of their personal life in the apparent hope of receiving help or advice.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/business/28psych.html \"Cornered: Therapists on Planes\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814174117/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/business/28psych.html |date=14 August 2016 }},  Liz Galst. ''[[The New York Times]]'' 27 September 2010, accessed 28 September 2010</ref>\n\n===Narcissism===\nConversational [[narcissism]] is a term used by sociologist [[Charles Derber]] in his book, ''The Pursuit of Attention: Power and Ego in Everyday Life''.\n\nDerber observed that the social support system in America is relatively weak, and this leads people to compete mightily for attention. In social situations, they tend to steer the conversation away from others and toward themselves. \"Conversational narcissism is the key manifestation of the dominant attention-getting psychology in America,\" he wrote. \"It occurs in informal conversations among friends, family and coworkers. The profusion of popular literature about listening and the etiquette of managing those who talk constantly about themselves suggests its pervasiveness in everyday life.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Derber|first1=Charles|title=The Pursuit of Attention: Power and Ego in Everyday Life|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195135504|page=19|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXmOXQPc6eEC&pg=PA19|accessdate=2 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509175038/https://books.google.com/books?id=OXmOXQPc6eEC&pg=PA19|archivedate=9 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWhat Derber describes as \"conversational narcissism\" often occurs subtly rather than overtly because it is prudent to avoid being judged an [[Egotism|egotist]].\n\nDerber distinguishes the \"shift-response\" from the \"support-response\". A shift response takes the focus of attention away from the last speaker and refocuses on the new speaker, as in: \"John: I'm feeling really starved. Mary: Oh, I just ate.\" Whereas a support response maintains the focus on the last speaker, as in: \"John: I'm feeling really starved. Mary: When was the last time you ate?\"\n\n===Artificial intelligence===\nThe ability to generate conversation that cannot be distinguished from a human participant has been one test of a successful artificial intelligence (The [[Turing Test]]).  A human judge engages in a natural language conversation with one human and one machine, each of which tries to appear human. If the judge cannot tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. One limitation is that the conversation is limited to a text, not allowing tone to be shown.\n\n===One's self===\nAlso called [[intrapersonal communication]], the act of conversing with oneself can help solve problems or serve therapeutic purposes like avoiding silence.\n\n==In the media==\nAs a prominent and useful figure in most human lives, conversation is often used in the media, e.g. talk shows such as [[William F. Buckley, Jr.|William F. Buckley]]'s [[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]] or the [[Dick Cavett|Dick Cavett Show]].\n\n==Literature==\nAuthors who have written extensively on conversation and attempted to analyze its nature include:\n* Milton Wright wrote ''The Art of Conversation'', a comprehensive treatment of the subject, in 1936.  The book deals with conversation both for its own sake, and for political, sales, or religious ends.  Milton portrays conversation as an art or creation that people can play with and give life to.\n* Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Al Switzler, and Ron McMillan have written two [[The New York Times Best Seller List|''New York Times'' bestselling]] books on conversation. The first one, ''Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, teaches skills for handling disagreement and high-stakes issues at work and at home. The second book, ''Crucial Accountability: Tools for Resolving Violated Expectations, Broken Commitments, and Bad Behavior'', McGraw-Hill, 2013, teaches important skills for dealing with accountability issues.\n*''Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most'' (Viking Penguin, 1999) , a book by Bruce Patton, Douglas Patterson and [[Sheila Heen]] was one of the work products from the [[Harvard Negotiation Project]]. This book built on, and extended the approach developed by [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and \u00a0[[William Ury]] in ''Getting To Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1981). The book introduced useful concepts such as the Three Conversations ( The 'What Happened' Conversation, The Feelings Conversation, and The Identity Conversation ), Creating a Learning Conversation, and Collaborative Problem Solving.\n* [[Charles Blattberg]] has written two books defending an approach to politics that emphasizes conversation, in contrast to negotiation, as the preferred means of resolving conflict. His ''From Pluralist to Patriotic Politics: Putting Practice First'', Oxford and New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|0-19-829688-6}}, is a work of political philosophy; and his ''Shall We Dance? A Patriotic Politics for Canada'', Montreal and Kingston: [[McGill-Queen's University Press]], 2003, {{ISBN|0-7735-2596-3}}, applies that philosophy to the Canadian case.\n* Paul Drew & [[John Heritage]] \u2013 ''Talk at Work'', a study of how conversation changes in social and workplace situations.\n* [[Neil Postman]] \u2013 ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'' (Conversation is not the book's specific focus, but discourse in general gets good treatment here)\n* [[Deborah Tannen]]\n** ''The Argument Culture: Stopping America's War of Words''\n** ''Conversational Style: Analyzing Talk Among Friends'',\n** ''Gender and Discourse''\n** ''I Only Say This Because I Love You''\n** ''Talking from 9 to 5: Women and Men at Work''\n** ''[[That's Not What I Meant!]]''\n** ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]: Women and Men in Conversation''\n* [[Daniel Menaker]] \u2013 ''A Good Talk:  The Story and Skill of Conversation'' (published 2010)\n* Stephen Miller \u2013 ''Conversation: A History of a Declining Art'': provides an extensive history of conversation which dates back to the ancient Greeks with Socrates, and moving forward, to coffeehouses around the world, as well as the modern forces of the electronic age, talk shows, etc.\n\n=== In fiction ===\n* ''[[Conversation in the Cathedral]]'' (1969) is one of the main novels by the Peruvian writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]].\n\n===In \"Six Benefits of Better Conversation\"===\nThe benefits are:\n# Being better understood\n# Better understanding\n# Better self-confidence\n# Workplace value\n# Better self-care\n# Better relationships<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ekroth|first1=Lauren|title=Six Benefits of Better Conversation|url=http://www.hodu.com/con-benefits.shtml|website=Hodu|accessdate=5 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030165159/http://hodu.com/con-benefits.shtml|archivedate=30 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[A Complete Collection of Genteel and Ingenious Conversation]]'' (book)\n* [[Aizuchi]]\n* [[Awkward silence]]\n* [[Bohm Dialogue]]\n* [[Compulsive talking]]\n* [[Conversation Theory]]\n* [[Conversational narcissism]]\n* [[Richard Sharp (politician)|\"Conversation\" Sharp MP]]<ref>Knapman, D.

The first one, ''Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, teaches skills for handling disagreement and high-stakes issues at work and at home. The second book, ''Crucial Accountability: Tools for Resolving Violated Expectations, Broken Commitments, and Bad Behavior'', McGraw-Hill, 2013, teaches important skills for dealing with accountability issues.\n*''Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most'' (Viking Penguin, 1999) , a book by Bruce Patton, Douglas Patterson and [[Sheila Heen]] was one of the work products from the [[Harvard Negotiation Project]]. This book built on, and extended the approach developed by [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and \u00a0[[William Ury]] in ''Getting To Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1981). The book introduced useful concepts such as the Three Conversations ( The 'What Happened' Conversation, The Feelings Conversation, and The Identity Conversation ), Creating a Learning Conversation, and Collaborative Problem Solving.\n* [[Charles Blattberg]] has written two books defending an approach to politics that emphasizes conversation, in contrast to negotiation, as the preferred means of resolving conflict. His ''From Pluralist to Patriotic Politics: Putting Practice First'', Oxford and New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|0-19-829688-6}}, is a work of political philosophy; and his ''Shall We Dance? A Patriotic Politics for Canada'', Montreal and Kingston: [[McGill-Queen's University Press]], 2003, {{ISBN|0-7735-2596-3}}, applies that philosophy to the Canadian case.\n* Paul Drew & [[John Heritage]] \u2013 ''Talk at Work'', a study of how conversation changes in social and workplace situations.\n* [[Neil Postman]] \u2013 ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'' (Conversation is not the book's specific focus, but discourse in general gets good treatment here)\n* [[Deborah Tannen]]\n** ''The Argument Culture: Stopping America's War of Words''\n** ''Conversational Style: Analyzing Talk Among Friends'',\n** ''Gender and Discourse''\n** ''I Only Say This Because I Love You''\n** ''Talking from 9 to 5: Women and Men at Work''\n** ''[[That's Not What I Meant!]]''\n** ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]: Women and Men in Conversation''\n* [[Daniel Menaker]] \u2013 ''A Good Talk:  The Story and Skill of Conversation'' (published 2010)\n* Stephen Miller \u2013 ''Conversation: A History of a Declining Art'': provides an extensive history of conversation which dates back to the ancient Greeks with Socrates, and moving forward, to coffeehouses around the world, as well as the modern forces of the electronic age, talk shows, etc.\n\n=== In fiction ===\n* ''[[Conversation in the Cathedral]]'' (1969) is one of the main novels by the Peruvian writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]].\n\n===In \"Six Benefits of Better Conversation\"===\nThe benefits are:\n# Being better understood\n# Better understanding\n# Better self-confidence\n# Workplace value\n# Better self-care\n# Better relationships<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ekroth|first1=Lauren|title=Six Benefits of Better Conversation|url=http://www.hodu.com/con-benefits.shtml|website=Hodu|accessdate=5 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030165159/http://hodu.com/con-benefits.shtml|archivedate=30 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[A Complete Collection of Genteel and Ingenious Conversation]]'' (book)\n* [[Aizuchi]]\n* [[Awkward silence]]\n* [[Bohm Dialogue]]\n* [[Compulsive talking]]\n* [[Conversation Theory]]\n* [[Conversational narcissism]]\n* [[Richard Sharp (politician)|\"Conversation\" Sharp MP]]<ref>Knapman, D.

Described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as \u201cthe best band you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d Luna combine intricate guitar work, traditional rock rhythms, and poetic lyrics.\n\nThe earliest edition of the band also included drummer Stanley Demeski and bassist [[Justin Harwood]] (Demeski formerly of [[The Feelies]] and Harwood formerly of New Zealand band [[The Chills]]). The original line-up was expanded with the addition of guitarist Sean Eden for their second album, 1994's ''Bewitched''. Lee Wall replaced Demeski on drums in time for 1997's ''Pup Tent,'' and [[Britta Phillips]] of Ultra Baby Fat and [[The Belltower]] (also known as the singing voice of animated character [[Jem (TV series)|Jem]]) joined when bassist Justin Harwood departed in 2000. Phillips and Wareham became romantically involved and eventually married in 2007.\n\n==History==\nIn 1991, after the end of [[Galaxie 500]]'s US tour supporting the [[Cocteau Twins]], Dean Wareham told his bandmates [[Damon Krukowski]] and [[Naomi Yang]] that he was quitting the band. Wareham then signed a [[Artist development deal|demo deal]] with [[Elektra Records]] and recorded a number of tracks with [[Mercury Rev]] drummer Jimmy Chambers. Some of these recordings were later released on the \"Anesthesia\" single on [[No.6 Records]] in the US and Mint Tea in the UK under the name \"Dean Wareham.\" The same year, Krukowski and Yang released an album as Pierre Etiole, later renaming their new project [[Damon & Naomi]].\n\nElektra's VP of A&R, [[Terry Tolkin]], was impressed and Wareham signed a deal with Elektra, and started pulling together a band. He first contacted Justin Harwood, whom he had met while Harwood was playing with [[The Chills]], and they recruited drummer Byron Guthrie, formerly from [[Ultra Vivid Scene]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|pages=240/1}}</ref> The trio recorded demos (produced by [[Dave Fridmann]]) and played a series of live dates with [[Mercury Rev]] guitarist [[Grasshopper (musician)|Grasshopper]]. Guthrie was replaced by former [[The Feelies|Feelies]] drummer Stanley Demeski, and this line-up recorded the first album, ''[[Lunapark (album)|Lunapark]]'', produced by [[Fred Maher]] and released by Elektra under the name Luna\u00b2<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> to avoid confusion with a [[new-age]] musician known as \"Luna\". (Later an accord was reached which allowed the band to use the name Luna.)\n\nShortly after the release of ''Lunapark'', the band placed an advertisement in the ''[[Village Voice]]'' for a guitarist, and Canadian former drama student Sean Eden was recruited. The new four-piece recorded a number of cover versions that would become the ''Slide'' EP, and then toured the US. In mid-1993 the band supported the reformed [[Velvet Underground]] on their European tour, after which they recorded their second album. ''[[Bewitched (album)|Bewitched]]'' was recorded in New York City and co-produced by the band with [[Victor Van Vugt]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> Velvet Underground guitarist [[Sterling Morrison]] played guitar on two tracks. The album was released in 1994.\n\nIn 1995, the band went into Sorcerer Sound studio in New York City with producer [[Patrick McCarthy (record producer)|Pat McCarthy]] and engineer Mario Salvati to record their third album ''[[Penthouse (album)|Penthouse]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> The album featured [[Television (band)|Television]] guitarist [[Tom Verlaine]] on the tracks \"Moon Palace\" and \"23 Minutes in Brussels.\" The album was released in August 1995 to critical acclaim, with ''Rolling Stone'' declaring it one of the essential albums of the 1990s.<ref>Rolling Stone [http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rstone.html#Recordings%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9890s Essential Recordings of the '90s] last accessed: October 19, 2006</ref> The album featured a cover of [[Serge Gainsbourg]]'s \"Bonnie and Clyde\" as a hidden track; the song featured [[L\u00e6titia Sadier]] of [[Stereolab]] duetting with Dean Wareham. \"Bonnie and Clyde\" was released as a single in the UK and was named ''[[Melody Maker]]'' single of the week. ''Pup Tent'' followed in 1997.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/>\n\nIn 1999, the band recorded ''[[The Days of Our Nights]]'' for Elektra, but the label declined the album as \"not commercially viable\" and dropped the band.<ref>Full Of Wishes [http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/1999/04/luna-dropped-by-us-label-elektra/ Luna Dropped By Elektra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028195358/http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/1999/04/luna-dropped-by-us-label-elektra/ |date=2014-10-28 }} last accessed: October 28, 2014</ref> The record was ultimately released on Jericho Records in the US.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> Prior to the album's release, Justin Harwood left the band, and was replaced by Britta Phillips.

Described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as \u201cthe best band you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d Luna combine intricate guitar work, traditional rock rhythms, and poetic lyrics.\n\nThe earliest edition of the band also included drummer Stanley Demeski and bassist [[Justin Harwood]] (Demeski formerly of [[The Feelies]] and Harwood formerly of New Zealand band [[The Chills]]). The original line-up was expanded with the addition of guitarist Sean Eden for their second album, 1994's ''Bewitched''. Lee Wall replaced Demeski on drums in time for 1997's ''Pup Tent,'' and [[Britta Phillips]] of Ultra Baby Fat and [[The Belltower]] (also known as the singing voice of animated character [[Jem (TV series)|Jem]]) joined when bassist Justin Harwood departed in 2000. Phillips and Wareham became romantically involved and eventually married in 2007.\n\n==History==\nIn 1991, after the end of [[Galaxie 500]]'s US tour supporting the [[Cocteau Twins]], Dean Wareham told his bandmates [[Damon Krukowski]] and [[Naomi Yang]] that he was quitting the band. Wareham then signed a [[Artist development deal|demo deal]] with [[Elektra Records]] and recorded a number of tracks with [[Mercury Rev]] drummer Jimmy Chambers. Some of these recordings were later released on the \"Anesthesia\" single on [[No.6 Records]] in the US and Mint Tea in the UK under the name \"Dean Wareham.\" The same year, Krukowski and Yang released an album as Pierre Etiole, later renaming their new project [[Damon & Naomi]].\n\nElektra's VP of A&R, [[Terry Tolkin]], was impressed and Wareham signed a deal with Elektra, and started pulling together a band. He first contacted Justin Harwood, whom he had met while Harwood was playing with [[The Chills]], and they recruited drummer Byron Guthrie, formerly from [[Ultra Vivid Scene]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|pages=240/1}}</ref> The trio recorded demos (produced by [[Dave Fridmann]]) and played a series of live dates with [[Mercury Rev]] guitarist [[Grasshopper (musician)|Grasshopper]]. Guthrie was replaced by former [[The Feelies|Feelies]] drummer Stanley Demeski, and this line-up recorded the first album, ''[[Lunapark (album)|Lunapark]]'', produced by [[Fred Maher]] and released by Elektra under the name Luna\u00b2<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> to avoid confusion with a [[new-age]] musician known as \"Luna\". (Later an accord was reached which allowed the band to use the name Luna.)\n\nShortly after the release of ''Lunapark'', the band placed an advertisement in the ''[[Village Voice]]'' for a guitarist, and Canadian former drama student Sean Eden was recruited. The new four-piece recorded a number of cover versions that would become the ''Slide'' EP, and then toured the US. In mid-1993 the band supported the reformed [[Velvet Underground]] on their European tour, after which they recorded their second album. ''[[Bewitched (album)|Bewitched]]'' was recorded in New York City and co-produced by the band with [[Victor Van Vugt]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> Velvet Underground guitarist [[Sterling Morrison]] played guitar on two tracks. The album was released in 1994.\n\nIn 1995, the band went into Sorcerer Sound studio in New York City with producer [[Patrick McCarthy (record producer)|Pat McCarthy]] and engineer Mario Salvati to record their third album ''[[Penthouse (album)|Penthouse]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> The album featured [[Television (band)|Television]] guitarist [[Tom Verlaine]] on the tracks \"Moon Palace\" and \"23 Minutes in Brussels.\" The album was released in August 1995 to critical acclaim, with ''Rolling Stone'' declaring it one of the essential albums of the 1990s.<ref>Rolling Stone [http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rstone.html#Recordings%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9890s Essential Recordings of the '90s] last accessed: October 19, 2006</ref> The album featured a cover of [[Serge Gainsbourg]]'s \"Bonnie and Clyde\" as a hidden track; the song featured [[L\u00e6titia Sadier]] of [[Stereolab]] duetting with Dean Wareham. \"Bonnie and Clyde\" was released as a single in the UK and was named ''[[Melody Maker]]'' single of the week. ''Pup Tent'' followed in 1997.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/>\n\nIn 1999, the band recorded ''[[The Days of Our Nights]]'' for Elektra, but the label declined the album as \"not commercially viable\" and dropped the band.<ref>Full Of Wishes [http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/1999/04/luna-dropped-by-us-label-elektra/ Luna Dropped By Elektra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028195358/http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/1999/04/luna-dropped-by-us-label-elektra/ |date=2014-10-28 }} last accessed: October 28, 2014</ref> The record was ultimately released on Jericho Records in the US.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> Prior to the album's release, Justin Harwood left the band, and was replaced by Britta Phillips.

It is the second youngest unit of the [[Crag Group]], a sequence of four geological formations spanning the [[Pliocene]] to Lower Pleistocene transition in [[East Anglia]]. It was deposited between approximately 2.4 and 1.8 million years ago, during the [[Gelasian]] Stage.\n\nThe Norwich Crag is a marginal [[facies]] of the thicker, much better developed sedimentary sequence in the southern [[North Sea]] basin. It outcrops in the eastern half of the counties of [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]], and is also represented in [[Essex]] and [[Hertfordshire]].  It was deposited in a near-shore environment, and comprises a range of sands, silty clays and flint-rich gravels representing various [[Marine transgression|transgressive]] and [[Marine regression|regressive]] marine episodes. It rests in some places on the [[Red Crag Formation]] and in others [[unconformably]] on [[Coralline Crag Formation|Coralline Crag]], [[Palaeogene]] formations and [[Chalk Group]] bedrock. It is overlain by the [[Wroxham Crag Formation]], and unconformably by the [[Kesgrave Catchment Subgroup]] (part of the [[Dunwich Group]]) and Mid Pleistocene glacigenic deposits.\n\nNorwich Crag [[fossil]] [[fauna]] and [[flora]] have been studied since the 19th century for information about environmental conditions during the early Pleistocene. They provide evidence for a general climatic cooling trend from the Pliocene to the Pleistocene.\n\n== History of research ==\nThe term Crag was first used in a geological sense by R.C. Taylor in 1823, a word commonly used in [[Suffolk]] to designate a deposit of fossil sea shells<ref name=\"Forby_1830\">Forby, F (1830). ''The Vocabulary of East Anglia''.

It was variously termed the Mammaliferous Crag (Charlesworth 1836), Norwich Crag (Lyell 1839), Norfolk Crag (Phillips 1863) and Upper Crag (Godwin-Austen 1868).<ref name=\"Woodward_1881\"/> Five [[Horizon (geology)|horizons]] were initially recognised: the Mammaliferous Stone-Bed; the Fluvio-marine Crag; the Chillesford Crag; the Chillesford Clay; the Bure Valley Crag, including the Westleton Beds.<ref name=\"Woodward_1881\"/> Additional units were identified in the Norwich Crag Series, the Weybourne Crag<ref name=\"Prestwich_1890\">Prestwich, J (1890).

It is the second youngest unit of the [[Crag Group]], a sequence of four geological formations spanning the [[Pliocene]] to Lower Pleistocene transition in [[East Anglia]]. It was deposited between approximately 2.4 and 1.8 million years ago, during the [[Gelasian]] Stage.\n\nThe Norwich Crag is a marginal [[facies]] of the thicker, much better developed sedimentary sequence in the southern [[North Sea]] basin. It outcrops in the eastern half of the counties of [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]], and is also represented in [[Essex]] and [[Hertfordshire]].  It was deposited in a near-shore environment, and comprises a range of sands, silty clays and flint-rich gravels representing various [[Marine transgression|transgressive]] and [[Marine regression|regressive]] marine episodes. It rests in some places on the [[Red Crag Formation]] and in others [[unconformably]] on [[Coralline Crag Formation|Coralline Crag]], [[Palaeogene]] formations and [[Chalk Group]] bedrock. It is overlain by the [[Wroxham Crag Formation]], and unconformably by the [[Kesgrave Catchment Subgroup]] (part of the [[Dunwich Group]]) and Mid Pleistocene glacigenic deposits.\n\nNorwich Crag [[fossil]] [[fauna]] and [[flora]] have been studied since the 19th century for information about environmental conditions during the early Pleistocene. They provide evidence for a general climatic cooling trend from the Pliocene to the Pleistocene.\n\n== History of research ==\nThe term Crag was first used in a geological sense by R.C.

Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] in [[New York City]].  It was published weekly between January 8, 1868 and February 17, 1872.  With a combative style that matched its name, it primarily focused on [[women's rights]], especially [[Women's suffrage in the United States|prohibiting discrimination against women voting]], [[women's suffrage]].  It also covered other topics, however, such as politics, the labor movement and finance.  Anthony managed the business aspects of the paper while Stanton was co-editor along with [[Parker Pillsbury]], an abolitionist and a supporter of women's rights.\n\nInitial funding was provided by [[George Francis Train]], a controversial businessman who supported women's rights but alienated many activists with his views on politics and race. The funding that he arranged was enough to start the newspaper but not enough to sustain it.  After twenty-nine months, mounting debts forced Anthony to transfer the paper to [[Laura Curtis Bullard]], a wealthy women's rights activist who gave it a less radical tone.  The paper published its last issue less than two years later.\n\nIts significance was greater than its short lifespan would indicate. Established during a period when a split was developing within the women's rights movement, it gave Stanton and Anthony a means for expressing their views about the issues being disputed when it otherwise would have been difficult for them to make their voices heard.  It helped them strengthen their wing of the movement and prepare the way for an organization to represent it.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:The Revolution vol 1 number 2.png|thumb|Front page of ''The Revolution'', January 15, 1868]]\nThe creators of ''The Revolution'', [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], were leading women's rights activists. Stanton was an organizer of the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] in 1848, the first women's rights convention, and the primary author of its [[Declaration of Sentiments]].<ref>Dumenil, 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=N-RMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA56 p. 56].</ref>\nAt the request of [[Lucy Stone]], another leading activist who had organized several of the [[National Women's Rights Convention]]s during the 1850s, Anthony performed much of the organizational work for the 1859 national convention and Stanton did the same in 1860.<ref>Million (2003), pp. 260, 263.</ref>\nTogether Anthony and Stanton established the [[Women's Loyal National League]] in 1863, which gathered a massive number of petitions calling for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery in the U.S.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA51 pp. 51\u221252]</ref>\nThe two activists remained close friends and co-workers for the remainder of their lives.\n\n[[File:Napoleon Sarony - Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony - Google Art Project-cropped.jpg|thumb|left| Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony about 1870]]\nThey established ''The Revolution'' during a period when a split was developing within the women's rights movement.  A major point of disagreement was the proposed [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], which would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race.  Most radical social reformers supported it, but Stanton and Anthony opposed it unless it was accompanied by another amendment that would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of sex. Otherwise, they said, the Fifteenth Amendment, which would in effect [[suffrage|enfranchise]] all men while excluding all women, would create an \"aristocracy of sex\" by giving constitutional authority to the belief that men were superior to women.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/185 pp. 172\u2212175, 185]</ref>\n\nWomen's rights activists also differed over the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement, which together had provided leadership for ending slavery in the U.S. in 1865.  The leading figures in the women's rights movement strongly opposed slavery (Anthony herself had been on the staff of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]]<ref>Barry (1988), p. 110</ref>),\nand many activists felt a sense of loyalty toward the Republican and abolitionist leadership.  Stanton and Anthony were sharply critical of both, however, for failing to support women's suffrage.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/163 pp. 163\u2212164]</ref>\n\nA pivotal event was the 1867 campaign conducted in Kansas by the [[American Equal Rights Association]] (AERA) in support of two state referenda, one that would [[suffrage|enfranchise]] African American men and one that would enfranchise women.  The AERA had been established the previous year, with Anthony and Stanton among its founders, to support the rights of both women and blacks.  Leaders of the abolitionist movement, however, refused to support the AERA's Kansas campaign, even though suffrage for black men was an abolitionist priority, because they did not want the two suffrage campaigns to be combined.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA105 p. 105]</ref>\nThe AERA had encountered similar obstacles during an earlier campaign in New York State.  Campaigning in Kansas with the AERA in support of both referenda, Anthony and Stanton were angered not only because national abolitionist leaders were withholding support but also because local Republicans had organized a committee to oppose the women's suffrage referendum.  Feeling betrayed, Stanton and Anthony stirred up a storm of protest by accepting help during the last days of the campaign from [[George Francis Train]], a wealthy supporter of women's rights who was a Democrat and an outspoken racist.  Train harshly criticized the Republican Party, making no secret of his intention to tarnish its progressive image and create splits within it. When the Kansas campaign ended in November 1867 with the defeat of both referenda, the divisions within the women's movement began to deepen.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/79 pp. 79, 87\u221289, 93, 99-100]</ref>\n\nThe women's rights movement had greatly reduced its activity during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u22121865) because its leaders wanted to apply their energy to the fight against slavery.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/52 p. 52]</ref>\nAfter the war, leaders of the abolitionist movement pressured them to continue to delay their campaign for women's suffrage until suffrage for black males had been achieved.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/59 p. 59]</ref>\nStanton and Anthony felt their movement was being marginalized.  Later they said, \"Our liberal men counseled us to silence during the war, and we were silent on our own wrongs; they counseled us again to silence in Kansas and New York, lest we should defeat 'negro suffrage,' and threatened if we were not, we might fight the battle alone. We chose the latter, and were defeated. But standing alone we learned our power... woman must lead the way to her own enfranchisement.\"<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1887), [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/266/mode/2up p. 267]</ref>\n\nIt was becoming difficult for Stanton and Anthony, however, to make their voices heard. The abolitionist press, which had traditionally been the most dependable provider of news coverage for the women's rights movement, was no longer willing to play that role for their wing of the movement.<ref>DuBois (1978), pp. 73-74</ref>\nOther major periodicals associated with the radical social reform movements had either become more conservative or had quit publishing or soon would.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA69 pp. 69, 143]</ref>\nLittle help could be expected from women's rights periodicals because so few remained.<ref>Rakow and Kramarae eds.

Initially Stanton wrote most of the material related to women's rights.<ref name=cullen-215/>\nThe newspaper's motto, prominently displayed on the front page, was, \"Principle, not policy; Justice, not favors: Men, their rights and nothing more; Women, their rights and nothing less.\"\n\n====Content====\n[[File:The Revolution January 8, 1868.jpg|thumb|left|First issue of ''The Revolution'', January 8, 1868.]]\n''The Revolution'' focused primarily on women's rights, especially suffrage, but it also dealt with other topics.  The paper reported on advancements made by women, cases of discrimination against women in employment, and improvements in divorce laws.   It followed activities of the women's movement, including speeches, meeting announcements, convention proceedings and testimony before government bodies.  It reported on organizing efforts by women workers and the activities of other sections of the labor movement that were seen as potential allies. Foreign correspondents reported from England, continental Europe and India.  Train contributed his views on a variety of topics, including Irish independence and currency reform.  His associate, David Melliss, the financial editor of the ''New York World'', handled the paper's financial department. A typical issue carried one or two pages of advertisements.<ref name=cullen-215>Cullen-DuPont (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&pg=PA215  pp. 215-216], \"Revolution, The\"</ref><ref>\"Foreword\" by Berenice A. Carroll, in Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PR26 pp. xxvi-xxvii]</ref>\n\nThe newspaper strove for a lively tone.  Its correspondents were asked not to sentimentalize but to \"''Give us facts and experience'', in words, if you please, as hard as cannon-balls.\"<ref>\"To Correspondents,\" ''The Revolution'', January 6, 1870, p. 9.  Quoted in Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA37 p. 37]</ref>\nThe paper sparred vigorously with its opponents.  When the ''[[New York World]]''<!--per Rakow p 15--> criticized the women's movement, [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], an editor, responded, \"The ''World'' innocently asks us the question, why, like the Englishwomen, we do not sit still in our conventions, and get \"first class men\" to do the speaking? We might, with equal propriety, ask the ''World's'' editorial staff why they do not lay down their pens and get first class men to edit their journal?\"<ref>\"''The World'' Forsakes Us,\" ''The Revolution'', August 12, 1869, p. 88.

On the contrary, the newspaper declared, \"those who write for our columns are responsible only for what appears under their own names.  Hence if old Abolitionists and Slaveholders, Republicans and Democrats, Presbyterians and Universalists, Saints, Sinners and the Beecher family find themselves side by side in writing up the question of Woman Suffrage, they must pardon each other's differences on all other points\".<ref name=Rakow-1870-prospectus>\"Prospectus of the Revolution for 1870,\" ''The Revolution'', November 18, 1869, pp. 315\u2212316.  Quoted in Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA39 p. 39]</ref> \nAn important function of the paper was to provide a forum in which its readers, most of whom were women, could exchange opinions.  Its readers responded with a steady stream of commentary from a variety of viewpoints.  Sometimes those readers identified themselves fully, but many signed themselves with as little as a single initial, leaving their identities still unknown.<ref>Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA6 p. 6].

Rakow and Kramarae list an extensive sampling of contributors in their book's table of contents, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PR7-24 pp. 7\u221224].  \n</ref>\n\nThe writers of the newspaper found inspiration in [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'', which had been published in 1869.  Following years of British reformers' criticism on the topic, Mill wrote that marriage was an institution of despotism and ushered the discussion into a more mainstream domain.  Stanton looked up to Mill and used his ideas as a guide for her own.<ref>Stansell, Christine. The Feminist Promise: 1792 to the Present. Reprint edition. New York: Modern Library, 2011: 94.</ref>\n\nBy 1869, Stanton was alone in writing the newspaper.  She enthusiastically turned to the themes of sexuality and marriage, seizing the opportunity to use a local New York scandal as a caustic platform.  The scandal was the trial of Daniel McFarland, a man who was convicted of murdering his ex-wife Abigail's fianc\u00e9, Albert Richardson, who had been a popular writer for [[Horace Greeley]]'s ''[[New-York Tribune|Tribune]]''.  In writing about the trial, Stanton was determined to break through the \"hypocrisy that prevented frank discussion of marriage by bringing the steamy facts of desire, jealousy, and extramarital sex uncomfortably close in a way that oblique discussions about coverture could not.\"  The judge would not recognize Abigail's divorce and therefore prevented her from testifying against her husband, who was eventually acquitted on grounds of insanity.  After the verdict, Stanton appealed for change\u2014namely, for divorce laws to be altered and improved.<ref>Stansell, Christine. The Feminist Promise: 1792 to the Present. Reprint edition. New York: Modern Library, 2011: 94-5.</ref>\n\n====Campaigns and issues====\n''The Revolution'' supported a number of causes that challenged tradition.  It criticized the long and heavy dresses that women were expected to wear at all times and the practice of women promising to \"obey\" as part of marriage ceremonies.  It reported cases of women attempting to vote in defiance of laws that prohibited them from doing so.  It referred to practices that society did not want to discuss openly, such as husbands beating and forcing themselves sexually on their wives.  Voicing an opinion that was highly controversial at that time, it advocated divorce as a legitimate option for women in abusive marriages.  Rejecting the notion that each woman should be under the control of a man, it called for women to be in control of both their own bodies and their destinies.<ref>Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA191 pp. 74, 140, 191\u2212192, 240]</ref>  \nIts aggressive advocacy of such controversial opinions drew the attention of the mainstream press, much of it hostile.  That was acceptable to Stanton, who believed that it was better for the women's movement to be attacked than to be ignored.<ref>Streitmatter (2001), [https://archive.org/details/voicesofrevoluti0000stre/page/42 p. 42]</ref>\n\nDuring 1868, the paper conducted an energetic campaign in support of [[Hester Vaughn]], a domestic worker whose former employer had impregnated her.  Destitute and seriously ill, she gave birth alone in an unheated room where the baby died. Vaughn was accused of deliberately allowing the baby to die and sentenced to be executed. After publicizing the case in ''The Revolution'', Stanton visited the governor to ask him to pardon Vaughn, which he eventually did.<ref>Barry (1988), p. 217.  See \"The Case of Hester Vaughn,\" ''The Revolution'', December 10, 1868, p. 357.</ref>\n\n''The Revolution'' applauded the growth of the [[National Labor Union]] (NLU), which existed from 1866 to 1873, hoping to join with it in a broad alliance that would create a new political party, one that would support women's suffrage as well as the demands of working people.  ''The Revolution'' declared, \"The principles of the National Labor Union are our principles.\"<ref>\"The National Labor Union and U.S. Bonds,\" ''The Revolution'', April 9, 1868, p. 213.  Quoted in DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/110 pp. 110\u2212111].</ref>\nIt predicted that, \"The producers\u2014the working-men, the women, the negroes\u2014are destined to form a triple power that shall speedily wrest the sceptre of government from the non-producers\u2014the land monopolists, the bond-holders, the politicians.\"<ref>\"National Labor Congress,\" ''The Revolution'', October 1, 1868, p. 200.</ref>\nAlthough the NLU responded warmly to ''The Revolution'''s overtures, the anticipated alliance did not develop.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/117 pp. 117\u2212125].</ref>\n\n====Woman's Suffrage Association of America====\nIn May 1868, ''The Revolution'' announced the formation of the Woman's Suffrage Association of America to serve as a coordinating committee for the local women's suffrage organizations that had developed around the country.  Its officers included Stanton and Anthony, and it shared ''The Revolution'''s office.  Stanton later said, \"''The Revolution'', holding the ground of universal suffrage irrespective of color or sex, is specially the organ of the Woman's Suffrage Association of America.\"<ref>\"What is the Difference,\" ''The Revolution'', July 9, 1868, pp. 8-9</ref>\nThe new organization published a petition in ''The Revolution'' in favor of women's suffrage and asked its readers to circulate it.<ref>\"Petition for Equal Suffrage,\" ''The Revolution'', November 19, 1868, p. 305. Also see Gordon (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kjq1rbyN_IQC&pg=PA134 pp. 134\u2212135, 188\u2212189]</ref>\nThe coordinating committee was soon replaced, however, by a broader women's suffrage organization.\n\n====Deepening divide in the women's movement====\nMany social reformers were deeply dismayed at ''The Revolution's'' refusal to support the proposed Fifteenth Amendment, which would enfranchise black men, unless it was accompanied by another amendment that would also enfranchise women.  Stanton, who came from a socially prominent family, opposed it in ''The Revolution'' with language that was sometimes elitist and racially condescending.  Stanton wrote, \"American women of wealth, education, virtue and refinement, if you do not wish the lower orders of Chinese, Africans, Germans and Irish, with their low ideas of womanhood to make laws for you and your daughters ... demand that women too shall be represented in government.\"<ref>Elizabeth Cady Stanton, \"The Sixteenth Amendment,\" ''The Revolution'', April 29, 1869, p. 266.  Quoted in DuBois (1978), p. 178.</ref>\n\nThe deepening divide within the women's movement reached a breaking point with the acrimonious disputes at the [[American Equal Rights Association]] meeting in May 1869, which led to the demise of that organization.  Two days after that meeting, the split began to be formalized when the two founders of ''The Revolution'' hosted a gathering at which the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] was formed, led by the same two people, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.<ref>DuBois (1978), p. 189</ref>\nIn November 1869 the competing [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA) was formed, with [[Lucy Stone]] in the lead.  In January 1870 Stone launched a rival newspaper called the ''[[Woman's Journal]]''. Both the AWSA and the ''Woman's Journal'' supported the Fifteenth Amendment.  Despite conjecture at the time, there is little evidence that ''The Revolution'' suffered significantly from competition with the ''Woman's Journal''.  Few subscribers switched allegiance, many subscribed to both journals and subscriptions to ''The Revolution'' continued to increase.<ref>Russo and Kramarae (1990), p. 18</ref><ref name=rakow-18/>\n\n====Financial problems====\nTrain's promise of on-going support did not materialize.  He sailed for England the same day that ''The Revolution'' published its first issue and shortly afterwards was jailed for supporting Irish independence.<ref>Barry (1988), p. 187</ref>\nTrain provided a total of only $3000 for the paper, although his business associate David Melliss provided another $7000.<ref name=harper-354/>\nOn May 8, 1869, ''The Revolution'' announced that its relationship with Train had officially ended.<ref>\"Letter from Geo.

After actress Abby Sage divorced her abusive husband, McFarland, and took Richardson as her lover, McFarland murdered Richardson.  McFarland was acquitted on grounds of insanity and awarded custody of the child Sage had with him.  Conservatives who stressed the sanctity of marriage placed the blame on Sage.  ''The Revolution'' publicized the trial, and Stanton and Anthony organized a mass meeting to condemn the judge and jury and to demand that McFarland be committed to an insane asylum.

One historian has conjectured that Bullard selected the motto partly to fend off accusations that the women's rights movement would destroy the institution of marriage.<ref>Bullard and Kohn, 2010, pp. xviii-xix</ref>\nShe gave it her own interpretation, however, saying \"it is a time-honored form of words expressing not only one limited idea but many other noble meanings.\"  Woman, she continued, \"has been systematically divorced from [man] from the beginning of time: she is now to proclaim and enforce her marriage rights.  She is to have an equal place with him in the trades, in the colleges, in the lyceum, in the press, in literature, in science, in art, in government, in everything.\"<ref>\"Motto of the Journal,\" ''The Revolution'', September 15, 1870, p. 168.

(2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA18 pp. 18, 42]</ref>\n\nBullard's editorial style was much less confrontational than Stanton's, and she oriented the paper more towards literature and poetry, leading Anthony's authorized biographer to say that Bullard turned the paper into a \"literary and society journal\".<ref>Harper (1899), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n429/mode/2up p. 363]</ref>\nIn its own way, however, it continued to deal with a wide range of women's rights issues despite those who wanted the movement to focus narrowly on suffrage.  In response to direct criticism, Bullard wrote, \"the ''Woman's Journal'', in attempting to reduce the woman's movement to the square-inch of the ballot, writes itself down in 1870 as more conservative than the originators of the movement were in 1848.\"<ref>\"What Flag Shall We Fly\", ''The Revolution'', October 27, 1870, p. 264.

Stanton and Anthony had refused to carry advertisements for patent medicines because they saw them as hazardous to health.<ref name=bullard-xvii/>\n\nBullard traveled to Europe in December 1870 with her elderly parents but continued to edit ''The Revolution'' from abroad.  After sixteen months as editor she resigned in October 1871, citing the difficulty of editing the paper in that fashion.<ref name=bullard-xx/>\n\n===Clark editorship===\nOn October 28, 1871, the newspaper was transferred to a new editor, Rev. W. T. Clarke, and publisher, J. N. Hallock.  Its motto became: \"Devoted to the Interest of Woman and Home Culture\".<ref name=rakow-19/>\nClarke supported women's suffrage, but his approach toward other women's issues often differed from previous editors. In his first issue Clarke said, \"Most men are exceedingly kind to women, and treat them with too much tenderness rather than too little. More women among us are injured by indulgence rather than injustice.\"<ref>\"Both Together,\" ''The Revolution'', October 28, 1871, p. 9.  Quoted in Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA19 p. 19]</ref>\nWith its flamboyantly revolutionary name but far-from-revolutionary content, ''The Revolution'' lasted only four months under Clarke's editorship, publishing its last issue on February 17, 1872.  Its subscription list was merged with Hallock's other newspaper, the ''Liberal Christian''.<ref name=rakow-19/>\n\n==Significance==\n''The Revolution'' confirmed the status of Stanton and Anthony as prominent public figures whose outspoken and often controversial statements helped to thrust the topic of women's rights forcefully into the national conversation.<ref name=dudden-146/> \nIt provided them with a means for expressing their views within the women's rights movement at a time of sharp disagreement about its direction.  It strengthened their wing of the movement and helped to prepare the way for an organization, the National Woman Suffrage Association, to represent it.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of suffragists and suffragettes]]\n*[[List of women's rights activists]]\n*[[Timeline of women's suffrage]]\n*[[List of suffragists and suffragettes#Women's suffrage publications|Women's suffrage publications]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* Barry, Kathleen (1988).

Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] in [[New York City]].  It was published weekly between January 8, 1868 and February 17, 1872.  With a combative style that matched its name, it primarily focused on [[women's rights]], especially [[Women's suffrage in the United States|prohibiting discrimination against women voting]], [[women's suffrage]].  It also covered other topics, however, such as politics, the labor movement and finance.  Anthony managed the business aspects of the paper while Stanton was co-editor along with [[Parker Pillsbury]], an abolitionist and a supporter of women's rights.\n\nInitial funding was provided by [[George Francis Train]], a controversial businessman who supported women's rights but alienated many activists with his views on politics and race. The funding that he arranged was enough to start the newspaper but not enough to sustain it.  After twenty-nine months, mounting debts forced Anthony to transfer the paper to [[Laura Curtis Bullard]], a wealthy women's rights activist who gave it a less radical tone.  The paper published its last issue less than two years later.\n\nIts significance was greater than its short lifespan would indicate. Established during a period when a split was developing within the women's rights movement, it gave Stanton and Anthony a means for expressing their views about the issues being disputed when it otherwise would have been difficult for them to make their voices heard.  It helped them strengthen their wing of the movement and prepare the way for an organization to represent it.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:The Revolution vol 1 number 2.png|thumb|Front page of ''The Revolution'', January 15, 1868]]\nThe creators of ''The Revolution'', [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], were leading women's rights activists. Stanton was an organizer of the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] in 1848, the first women's rights convention, and the primary author of its [[Declaration of Sentiments]].<ref>Dumenil, 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=N-RMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA56 p. 56].</ref>\nAt the request of [[Lucy Stone]], another leading activist who had organized several of the [[National Women's Rights Convention]]s during the 1850s, Anthony performed much of the organizational work for the 1859 national convention and Stanton did the same in 1860.<ref>Million (2003), pp. 260, 263.</ref>\nTogether Anthony and Stanton established the [[Women's Loyal National League]] in 1863, which gathered a massive number of petitions calling for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery in the U.S.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA51 pp. 51\u221252]</ref>\nThe two activists remained close friends and co-workers for the remainder of their lives.\n\n[[File:Napoleon Sarony - Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony - Google Art Project-cropped.jpg|thumb|left| Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony about 1870]]\nThey established ''The Revolution'' during a period when a split was developing within the women's rights movement.  A major point of disagreement was the proposed [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], which would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race.  Most radical social reformers supported it, but Stanton and Anthony opposed it unless it was accompanied by another amendment that would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of sex. Otherwise, they said, the Fifteenth Amendment, which would in effect [[suffrage|enfranchise]] all men while excluding all women, would create an \"aristocracy of sex\" by giving constitutional authority to the belief that men were superior to women.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/185 pp. 172\u2212175, 185]</ref>\n\nWomen's rights activists also differed over the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement, which together had provided leadership for ending slavery in the U.S. in 1865.  The leading figures in the women's rights movement strongly opposed slavery (Anthony herself had been on the staff of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]]<ref>Barry (1988), p. 110</ref>),\nand many activists felt a sense of loyalty toward the Republican and abolitionist leadership.  Stanton and Anthony were sharply critical of both, however, for failing to support women's suffrage.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/163 pp. 163\u2212164]</ref>\n\nA pivotal event was the 1867 campaign conducted in Kansas by the [[American Equal Rights Association]] (AERA) in support of two state referenda, one that would [[suffrage|enfranchise]] African American men and one that would enfranchise women.  The AERA had been established the previous year, with Anthony and Stanton among its founders, to support the rights of both women and blacks.  Leaders of the abolitionist movement, however, refused to support the AERA's Kansas campaign, even though suffrage for black men was an abolitionist priority, because they did not want the two suffrage campaigns to be combined.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA105 p. 105]</ref>\nThe AERA had encountered similar obstacles during an earlier campaign in New York State.  Campaigning in Kansas with the AERA in support of both referenda, Anthony and Stanton were angered not only because national abolitionist leaders were withholding support but also because local Republicans had organized a committee to oppose the women's suffrage referendum.  Feeling betrayed, Stanton and Anthony stirred up a storm of protest by accepting help during the last days of the campaign from [[George Francis Train]], a wealthy supporter of women's rights who was a Democrat and an outspoken racist.  Train harshly criticized the Republican Party, making no secret of his intention to tarnish its progressive image and create splits within it. When the Kansas campaign ended in November 1867 with the defeat of both referenda, the divisions within the women's movement began to deepen.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/79 pp. 79, 87\u221289, 93, 99-100]</ref>\n\nThe women's rights movement had greatly reduced its activity during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u22121865) because its leaders wanted to apply their energy to the fight against slavery.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/52 p. 52]</ref>\nAfter the war, leaders of the abolitionist movement pressured them to continue to delay their campaign for women's suffrage until suffrage for black males had been achieved.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/59 p. 59]</ref>\nStanton and Anthony felt their movement was being marginalized.  Later they said, \"Our liberal men counseled us to silence during the war, and we were silent on our own wrongs; they counseled us again to silence in Kansas and New York, lest we should defeat 'negro suffrage,' and threatened if we were not, we might fight the battle alone. We chose the latter, and were defeated. But standing alone we learned our power... woman must lead the way to her own enfranchisement.\"<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1887), [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/266/mode/2up p. 267]</ref>\n\nIt was becoming difficult for Stanton and Anthony, however, to make their voices heard. The abolitionist press, which had traditionally been the most dependable provider of news coverage for the women's rights movement, was no longer willing to play that role for their wing of the movement.<ref>DuBois (1978), pp. 73-74</ref>\nOther major periodicals associated with the radical social reform movements had either become more conservative or had quit publishing or soon would.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA69 pp. 69, 143]</ref>\nLittle help could be expected from women's rights periodicals because so few remained.<ref>Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA14 p. 14]</ref>  \nThe mainstream press had begun to treat the women's movement as old news after more than a decade of treating it as a novelty worthy of news coverage.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA142 pp. 142\u2212143]</ref>\n<!--They needed a platform for their views, and from their standpoint there was a clear opening for a periodical that would serve the needs of the broader radical social movement.-->\n\n===Stanton and Pillsbury editorship===\n\n====Establishing the newspaper====\nDefying pressure to sever their relationship with Train, Stanton and Anthony instead made a deal with him to establish a weekly newspaper that they would operate with his financial backing, which he indicated could be as much as $100,000.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA135 p. 135]</ref>\nTrain and his associate David Melliss would have space to express their views, but otherwise Stanton and Anthony would be free to run the paper in the interests of women.<ref>Harper (1899), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n357/mode/2up p. 295]</ref><!--also Dubois 94-->\nPlans were quickly made plans for a national newspaper with a circulation goal that would make it as large as a major New York daily.<ref>Dudden (2011), p. 145</ref>\nAnthony hoped to grow it eventually into a daily paper with its own printing press, all owned and operated by women.<ref>\"The Working Women's Association,\" ''The Revolution'', November 5, 1868, p. 280.

Initially Stanton wrote most of the material related to women's rights.<ref name=cullen-215/>\nThe newspaper's motto, prominently displayed on the front page, was, \"Principle, not policy; Justice, not favors: Men, their rights and nothing more; Women, their rights and nothing less.\"\n\n====Content====\n[[File:The Revolution January 8, 1868.jpg|thumb|left|First issue of ''The Revolution'', January 8, 1868.]]\n''The Revolution'' focused primarily on women's rights, especially suffrage, but it also dealt with other topics.  The paper reported on advancements made by women, cases of discrimination against women in employment, and improvements in divorce laws.   It followed activities of the women's movement, including speeches, meeting announcements, convention proceedings and testimony before government bodies.  It reported on organizing efforts by women workers and the activities of other sections of the labor movement that were seen as potential allies. Foreign correspondents reported from England, continental Europe and India.  Train contributed his views on a variety of topics, including Irish independence and currency reform.  His associate, David Melliss, the financial editor of the ''New York World'', handled the paper's financial department. A typical issue carried one or two pages of advertisements.<ref name=cullen-215>Cullen-DuPont (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&pg=PA215  pp. 215-216], \"Revolution, The\"</ref><ref>\"Foreword\" by Berenice A. Carroll, in Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PR26 pp. xxvi-xxvii]</ref>\n\nThe newspaper strove for a lively tone.  Its correspondents were asked not to sentimentalize but to \"''Give us facts and experience'', in words, if you please, as hard as cannon-balls.\"<ref>\"To Correspondents,\" ''The Revolution'', January 6, 1870, p. 9.  Quoted in Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA37 p. 37]</ref>\nThe paper sparred vigorously with its opponents.  When the ''[[New York World]]''<!--per Rakow p 15--> criticized the women's movement, [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], an editor, responded, \"The ''World'' innocently asks us the question, why, like the Englishwomen, we do not sit still in our conventions, and get \"first class men\" to do the speaking? We might, with equal propriety, ask the ''World's'' editorial staff why they do not lay down their pens and get first class men to edit their journal?\"<ref>\"''The World'' Forsakes Us,\" ''The Revolution'', August 12, 1869, p. 88.

On the contrary, the newspaper declared, \"those who write for our columns are responsible only for what appears under their own names.  Hence if old Abolitionists and Slaveholders, Republicans and Democrats, Presbyterians and Universalists, Saints, Sinners and the Beecher family find themselves side by side in writing up the question of Woman Suffrage, they must pardon each other's differences on all other points\".<ref name=Rakow-1870-prospectus>\"Prospectus of the Revolution for 1870,\" ''The Revolution'', November 18, 1869, pp. 315\u2212316.  Quoted in Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA39 p. 39]</ref> \nAn important function of the paper was to provide a forum in which its readers, most of whom were women, could exchange opinions.  Its readers responded with a steady stream of commentary from a variety of viewpoints.  Sometimes those readers identified themselves fully, but many signed themselves with as little as a single initial, leaving their identities still unknown.<ref>Rakow and Kramarae eds.

Following years of British reformers' criticism on the topic, Mill wrote that marriage was an institution of despotism and ushered the discussion into a more mainstream domain.  Stanton looked up to Mill and used his ideas as a guide for her own.<ref>Stansell, Christine. The Feminist Promise: 1792 to the Present. Reprint edition. New York: Modern Library, 2011: 94.</ref>\n\nBy 1869, Stanton was alone in writing the newspaper.  She enthusiastically turned to the themes of sexuality and marriage, seizing the opportunity to use a local New York scandal as a caustic platform.  The scandal was the trial of Daniel McFarland, a man who was convicted of murdering his ex-wife Abigail's fianc\u00e9, Albert Richardson, who had been a popular writer for [[Horace Greeley]]'s ''[[New-York Tribune|Tribune]]''.  In writing about the trial, Stanton was determined to break through the \"hypocrisy that prevented frank discussion of marriage by bringing the steamy facts of desire, jealousy, and extramarital sex uncomfortably close in a way that oblique discussions about coverture could not.\"  The judge would not recognize Abigail's divorce and therefore prevented her from testifying against her husband, who was eventually acquitted on grounds of insanity.  After the verdict, Stanton appealed for change\u2014namely, for divorce laws to be altered and improved.<ref>Stansell, Christine. The Feminist Promise: 1792 to the Present. Reprint edition. New York: Modern Library, 2011: 94-5.</ref>\n\n====Campaigns and issues====\n''The Revolution'' supported a number of causes that challenged tradition.  It criticized the long and heavy dresses that women were expected to wear at all times and the practice of women promising to \"obey\" as part of marriage ceremonies.  It reported cases of women attempting to vote in defiance of laws that prohibited them from doing so.  It referred to practices that society did not want to discuss openly, such as husbands beating and forcing themselves sexually on their wives.  Voicing an opinion that was highly controversial at that time, it advocated divorce as a legitimate option for women in abusive marriages.  Rejecting the notion that each woman should be under the control of a man, it called for women to be in control of both their own bodies and their destinies.<ref>Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA191 pp. 74, 140, 191\u2212192, 240]</ref>  \nIts aggressive advocacy of such controversial opinions drew the attention of the mainstream press, much of it hostile.  That was acceptable to Stanton, who believed that it was better for the women's movement to be attacked than to be ignored.<ref>Streitmatter (2001), [https://archive.org/details/voicesofrevoluti0000stre/page/42 p. 42]</ref>\n\nDuring 1868, the paper conducted an energetic campaign in support of [[Hester Vaughn]], a domestic worker whose former employer had impregnated her.  Destitute and seriously ill, she gave birth alone in an unheated room where the baby died. Vaughn was accused of deliberately allowing the baby to die and sentenced to be executed. After publicizing the case in ''The Revolution'', Stanton visited the governor to ask him to pardon Vaughn, which he eventually did.<ref>Barry (1988), p. 217.  See \"The Case of Hester Vaughn,\" ''The Revolution'', December 10, 1868, p. 357.</ref>\n\n''The Revolution'' applauded the growth of the [[National Labor Union]] (NLU), which existed from 1866 to 1873, hoping to join with it in a broad alliance that would create a new political party, one that would support women's suffrage as well as the demands of working people.  ''The Revolution'' declared, \"The principles of the National Labor Union are our principles.\"<ref>\"The National Labor Union and U.S. Bonds,\" ''The Revolution'', April 9, 1868, p. 213.  Quoted in DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/110 pp. 110\u2212111].</ref>\nIt predicted that, \"The producers\u2014the working-men, the women, the negroes\u2014are destined to form a triple power that shall speedily wrest the sceptre of government from the non-producers\u2014the land monopolists, the bond-holders, the politicians.\"<ref>\"National Labor Congress,\" ''The Revolution'', October 1, 1868, p. 200.</ref>\nAlthough the NLU responded warmly to ''The Revolution'''s overtures, the anticipated alliance did not develop.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/117 pp. 117\u2212125].</ref>\n\n====Woman's Suffrage Association of America====\nIn May 1868, ''The Revolution'' announced the formation of the Woman's Suffrage Association of America to serve as a coordinating committee for the local women's suffrage organizations that had developed around the country.  Its officers included Stanton and Anthony, and it shared ''The Revolution'''s office.  Stanton later said, \"''The Revolution'', holding the ground of universal suffrage irrespective of color or sex, is specially the organ of the Woman's Suffrage Association of America.\"<ref>\"What is the Difference,\" ''The Revolution'', July 9, 1868, pp. 8-9</ref>\nThe new organization published a petition in ''The Revolution'' in favor of women's suffrage and asked its readers to circulate it.<ref>\"Petition for Equal Suffrage,\" ''The Revolution'', November 19, 1868, p. 305. Also see Gordon (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kjq1rbyN_IQC&pg=PA134 pp. 134\u2212135, 188\u2212189]</ref>\nThe coordinating committee was soon replaced, however, by a broader women's suffrage organization.\n\n====Deepening divide in the women's movement====\nMany social reformers were deeply dismayed at ''The Revolution's'' refusal to support the proposed Fifteenth Amendment, which would enfranchise black men, unless it was accompanied by another amendment that would also enfranchise women.  Stanton, who came from a socially prominent family, opposed it in ''The Revolution'' with language that was sometimes elitist and racially condescending.  Stanton wrote, \"American women of wealth, education, virtue and refinement, if you do not wish the lower orders of Chinese, Africans, Germans and Irish, with their low ideas of womanhood to make laws for you and your daughters ... demand that women too shall be represented in government.\"<ref>Elizabeth Cady Stanton, \"The Sixteenth Amendment,\" ''The Revolution'', April 29, 1869, p. 266.  Quoted in DuBois (1978), p. 178.</ref>\n\nThe deepening divide within the women's movement reached a breaking point with the acrimonious disputes at the [[American Equal Rights Association]] meeting in May 1869, which led to the demise of that organization.  Two days after that meeting, the split began to be formalized when the two founders of ''The Revolution'' hosted a gathering at which the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] was formed, led by the same two people, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.<ref>DuBois (1978), p. 189</ref>\nIn November 1869 the competing [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA) was formed, with [[Lucy Stone]] in the lead.  In January 1870 Stone launched a rival newspaper called the ''[[Woman's Journal]]''. Both the AWSA and the ''Woman's Journal'' supported the Fifteenth Amendment.  Despite conjecture at the time, there is little evidence that ''The Revolution'' suffered significantly from competition with the ''Woman's Journal''.  Few subscribers switched allegiance, many subscribed to both journals and subscriptions to ''The Revolution'' continued to increase.<ref>Russo and Kramarae (1990), p. 18</ref><ref name=rakow-18/>\n\n====Financial problems====\nTrain's promise of on-going support did not materialize.  He sailed for England the same day that ''The Revolution'' published its first issue and shortly afterwards was jailed for supporting Irish independence.<ref>Barry (1988), p. 187</ref>\nTrain provided a total of only $3000 for the paper, although his business associate David Melliss provided another $7000.<ref name=harper-354/>\nOn May 8, 1869, ''The Revolution'' announced that its relationship with Train had officially ended.<ref>\"Letter from Geo. Francis Train\" and \"George Francis Train,\" ''The Revolution'', May 8, 1869, pp. 279-280</ref>\n\nPersonnel expenses were necessarily kept to a minimum.  Pillsbury, a professional editor who had worked at other newspapers, was paid a small salary.<ref>Rakow and Kramarae eds.

Both had already published articles in the paper.<ref name=Rakow-1870-prospectus/>\nNegotiations foundered, however, first over the name of the paper, which the two sisters wanted to change to ''The True Republic'', and then over the paper's coverage of a prominent social scandal in which Stanton took the unpopular stance of supporting the woman involved.<ref>Harper (1899), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n423/mode/2up pp. 356-358]  The Richardson-McFarland scandal occurred in 1870.  After actress Abby Sage divorced her abusive husband, McFarland, and took Richardson as her lover, McFarland murdered Richardson.  McFarland was acquitted on grounds of insanity and awarded custody of the child Sage had with him.  Conservatives who stressed the sanctity of marriage placed the blame on Sage.  ''The Revolution'' publicized the trial, and Stanton and Anthony organized a mass meeting to condemn the judge and jury and to demand that McFarland be committed to an insane asylum.

Studwell as publisher.<ref name=rakow-18/>\nBoth were strong supporters of women's suffrage.  Bullard had been elected as one of the [[National Women's Suffrage Association]]'s corresponding secretaries at its founding meeting, and she had already published articles in ''The Revolution''. She came from a family that had become wealthy by selling [[patent medicines]].<ref>Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA264 p. 264]</ref>\nStudwell was a Quaker abolitionist and financier.<ref name=bullard-xvii>Bullard and Kohn, 2010, p. xvii</ref>\n\nBullard gave the paper a new motto, the Biblical phrase: \"What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder\", which was often quoted in marriage ceremonies.  One historian has conjectured that Bullard selected the motto partly to fend off accusations that the women's rights movement would destroy the institution of marriage.<ref>Bullard and Kohn, 2010, pp. xviii-xix</ref>\nShe gave it her own interpretation, however, saying \"it is a time-honored form of words expressing not only one limited idea but many other noble meanings.\"  Woman, she continued, \"has been systematically divorced from [man] from the beginning of time: she is now to proclaim and enforce her marriage rights.  She is to have an equal place with him in the trades, in the colleges, in the lyceum, in the press, in literature, in science, in art, in government, in everything.\"<ref>\"Motto of the Journal,\" ''The Revolution'', September 15, 1870, p. 168.  Quoted in Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA18 pp. 18, 42]</ref>\n\nBullard's editorial style was much less confrontational than Stanton's, and she oriented the paper more towards literature and poetry, leading Anthony's authorized biographer to say that Bullard turned the paper into a \"literary and society journal\".<ref>Harper (1899), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n429/mode/2up p. 363]</ref>\nIn its own way, however, it continued to deal with a wide range of women's rights issues despite those who wanted the movement to focus narrowly on suffrage.  In response to direct criticism, Bullard wrote, \"the ''Woman's Journal'', in attempting to reduce the woman's movement to the square-inch of the ballot, writes itself down in 1870 as more conservative than the originators of the movement were in 1848.\"<ref>\"What Flag Shall We Fly\", ''The Revolution'', October 27, 1870, p. 264.  Quoted in Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA45 p. 45]</ref>\nStanton wrote occasional articles for the paper, as did several other women who had contributed during Stanton's editorship.<ref name=rakow-19>Rakow and Kramarae eds.

Stanton and Anthony had refused to carry advertisements for patent medicines because they saw them as hazardous to health.<ref name=bullard-xvii/>\n\nBullard traveled to Europe in December 1870 with her elderly parents but continued to edit ''The Revolution'' from abroad.  After sixteen months as editor she resigned in October 1871, citing the difficulty of editing the paper in that fashion.<ref name=bullard-xx/>\n\n===Clark editorship===\nOn October 28, 1871, the newspaper was transferred to a new editor, Rev. W. T. Clarke, and publisher, J. N. Hallock.  Its motto became: \"Devoted to the Interest of Woman and Home Culture\".<ref name=rakow-19/>\nClarke supported women's suffrage, but his approach toward other women's issues often differed from previous editors. In his first issue Clarke said, \"Most men are exceedingly kind to women, and treat them with too much tenderness rather than too little. More women among us are injured by indulgence rather than injustice.\"<ref>\"Both Together,\" ''The Revolution'', October 28, 1871, p. 9.  Quoted in Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA19 p. 19]</ref>\nWith its flamboyantly revolutionary name but far-from-revolutionary content, ''The Revolution'' lasted only four months under Clarke's editorship, publishing its last issue on February 17, 1872.  Its subscription list was merged with Hallock's other newspaper, the ''Liberal Christian''.<ref name=rakow-19/>\n\n==Significance==\n''The Revolution'' confirmed the status of Stanton and Anthony as prominent public figures whose outspoken and often controversial statements helped to thrust the topic of women's rights forcefully into the national conversation.<ref name=dudden-146/> \nIt provided them with a means for expressing their views within the women's rights movement at a time of sharp disagreement about its direction.  It strengthened their wing of the movement and helped to prepare the way for an organization, the National Woman Suffrage Association, to represent it.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of suffragists and suffragettes]]\n*[[List of women's rights activists]]\n*[[Timeline of women's suffrage]]\n*[[List of suffragists and suffragettes#Women's suffrage publications|Women's suffrage publications]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* Barry, Kathleen (1988).
