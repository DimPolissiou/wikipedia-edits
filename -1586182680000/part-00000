The three ships\u2014{{HMS|Furious|47|2}}, {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} and {{HMS|Glorious||2}}\u2014were originally laid down as [[Courageous-class battlecruiser]]s as part of the [[Baltic Project]] during the [[Naval warfare of World War I|First World War]]. While very fast, their minimal armour and few guns limited their long-term utility in the post-war Royal Navy, and they were [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|laid up]] after the war. They were considered [[capital ship]]s by the terms of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and were included in the total amount of tonnage allowed to the Royal Navy. Rather than [[ship breaking|scrap]] them, the Navy decided to convert them to aircraft carriers as permitted under the Treaty.\n\n''Furious'', already partially converted during the war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In an attempt to minimise air turbulence, she was given no [[superstructure]] or [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|island]]. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]; instead, her [[boiler]] uptakes ran along the sides of the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the [[flight deck]], or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her [[sister ship|half-sisters]], ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', began their conversions to aircraft carriers as ''Furious'' neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since ''Furious'' had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.\n\nAs the first large carrier completed by the Royal Navy, ''Furious'' was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures, including the first-ever carrier night landing in 1926. ''Courageous'' became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in the Second World War when she was [[torpedo]]ed in September 1939 by a German [[U-boat|submarine]]. ''Glorious'' participated in the [[Norwegian campaign]] in 1940, but she was sunk by two German [[battleship]]s in June as she sailed home with a minimal escort. ''Furious'' participated in many major operations during the war, including the Norwegian campaign in 1940, the [[Malta Convoys]] and ''[[Operation Torch]]'' in 1942, and airstrikes on the {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz}} and other targets in Norway in 1944. The ship was worn out by 1944 and was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] status in September 1944 before being [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1945 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1948.\n\n== Careers as battlecruisers ==\n{{Main|Courageous-class battlecruiser}}\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious (1917) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|''Glorious'' as a battlecruiser]]\nThe first two ships of the class, ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', spent the First World War on [[North Sea]] patrols, climaxing in the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in November 1917. Their half-sister ''Furious'' was designed with a pair of {{convert|18|in|0|adj=on}} guns\u2014as opposed to four {{convert|15|in|0|adj=on}}\u2014but was modified while being built to hold a flying-off deck and [[hangar]] in lieu of her forward [[gun turret|turret]] and [[barbette]]. She made some patrols in the North Sea before her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added. Her aircraft attacked [[Zeppelin]] sheds during the [[Tondern raid]] in July 1918.<ref>Roberts, p. 123</ref>\n\nAll three ships were reduced to reserve after the war. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the signatory nations to a set amount of capital ship tonnage; all ships in excess of this figure had to be scrapped. Up to {{convert|66000|LT|t}} of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers, and the Royal Navy decided to use the ''Courageous''-class ships due to their high speed. Each ship was reconstructed with a flight deck during the 1920s.<ref>Friedman, p. 97</ref>\n\n== Conversions ==\n[[File:HMS Furious-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Furious'' as she was during the First World War with separate take-off and landing decks and superstructure in between]]\n[[File:Dunning Landing-on Furious In Pup.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Sopwith Pup]] unsuccessfully attempting to land on ''Furious''{{'}}s forward flight deck, 7 August 1917]]\n{{HMS|Furious|47|2}} had been fitted during the First World War with a flying-off and landing deck, but the latter proved largely unusable because of the strong air currents around the superstructure and exhaust gases from the funnel. She was laid up after the war, but was converted to an aircraft carrier between June 1921 and September 1925. Her design was based on the very limited experience gained with the first two British carriers: {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}}, less than three years old, and {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}}, which had carried out only 143 deck landings during preliminary [[sea trial]]s in 1920.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 263\u201367</ref><ref>Burt 2012, p. 252</ref><ref>Brown, p. 252</ref>\n\n''Furious''{{'}}s superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a {{convert|576|by|92|ft|m|1|adj=on}} flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at the time it was designed. That era's fore-and-aft [[arresting gear]], initially {{convert|320|ft|1}} long on ''Furious'', was not intended to stop landing aircraft\u2014the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind\u2014but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges minimised turbulence. To minimise any turbulence over the flight deck, ''Furious'' was flush-decked and lacked an island, like ''Argus''; instead she was provided with a retractable [[Glossary of nautical terms#C|charthouse]] at the forward end of the flight deck.<ref>Friedman, pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nA two-level hangar was built under the flight deck, each level being {{convert|15|ft|1}} high. The lower hangar was {{convert|550|ft|1}} long by {{convert|35|-|50|ft|1}} wide and the upper was {{convert|520|by|50|ft|1}}. Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck, or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 264\u201365</ref> Two {{convert|47|by|46|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. Two {{convert|600|impgal|l USgal|adj=on}} ready-use [[petrol]] tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional {{convert|20000|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol were in bulk storage. The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard ''Furious'' in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side.<ref>Friedman, pp. 94\u201395</ref> ''Furious''{{'}}s long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\">Friedman, pp. 103, 105\u201306</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' and ''Courageous'' were converted to aircraft carriers after ''Furious'' began her reconstruction, ''Courageous'' at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] starting on 29 June 1924, and ''Glorious'' at [[Rosyth]] on 14 February 1924. The latter was moved to Devonport to complete the conversion after ''Furious'' was finished. Their design was based on ''Furious'' with a few improvements based on experience gained since she was designed. All superstructure, guns, and fittings down to the main deck were removed. A two-storey hangar, each level {{convert|16|ft|1}} high and {{convert|550|ft|m|1}} long, was built on top of the remaining hull; the upper hangar level opened onto a short flying-off deck, below and forward of the main flight deck. Two slightly larger {{convert|46|by|48|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck. An island was added on the starboard side with the bridge, flying control station, and funnel, as an island did not create as much turbulence as had been earlier feared. By 1939 both ships could carry {{convert|34500|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\" />\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:HMS Glorious underway 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of ''Glorious'', 1936]]\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|786|ft|9|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|90|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|28|ft|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. These were increases of {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m|1}} in beam and over {{convert|2|ft|m|1}} in draught compared to their earlier incarnations as battlecruisers. They displaced {{convert|24210|LT|t}} at normal load and {{convert|26990|LT|t|abbr=on}} at deep load, increases of over {{convert|3000|LT|t}}. Their [[metacentric height]] declined from {{convert|6|ft|1}} at deep load to {{convert|4.4|ft|1}} and the ships had a complete [[double bottom]].<ref name=r65>Roberts, pp. 64\u201365</ref> In 1939, ''Courageous'' had a complement of 807 officers and enlisted men, plus 403 men in her air group.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 283, 285</ref>\n\nTheir half-sister ''Furious'' was the same length, but had a beam of {{convert|89|ft|0.75|in|m|1}},<ref>Jenkins, front [[endpaper]]</ref> and an average draught of {{convert|27|ft|3|in|m|1}} at deep load, two feet deeper than before the conversion. She displaced {{convert|22500|LT|t}} at normal load and {{convert|26500|LT|t|abbr=on}} at deep load, over 3,000 long tons more than her previous displacement of {{convert|19513|LT|t}} at load and {{convert|22890|LT|t}} at deep load. ''Furious''{{'}}s metacentric height was {{convert|3.6|ft|1}} at deep load, a reduction of {{convert|1.48|ft|1}} after her conversion.<ref name=r65 /> In 1932, ''Furious'' had a complement of 738 officers and enlisted men, plus 468 men in her air group.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 266, 273</ref>\n\n=== Propulsion ===\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared [[steam turbine]]s. Arranged in two engine rooms, each of the turbines drove one of the four propeller shafts. ''Furious''{{'}}s propellers were {{convert|11|ft|6|in|m|1}} in diameter. The turbines were powered by 18 [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] small-tube boilers equally divided among three boiler rooms. The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|90000|shp|lk=in}} at a working pressure of {{convert|235|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref>Roberts, pp. 71, 76</ref> No significant changes to the machinery were made during the conversion process to any of the three ships, but their increased displacement reduced their speed to approximately {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}.<ref name=f5>Friedman, p. 95</ref>\n\n''Furious''{{'}}s fuel capacity was increased by {{convert|700|LT|t}} during her reconstruction, which increased her range to {{convert|7480|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=f3 /> The maximum fuel capacity of ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' was increased during the conversion to {{convert|3800|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]],<ref name=b83>Burt 2012, p. 283</ref> giving them an endurance of {{convert|6630|nmi|lk=in}} at 10 knots.<ref name=f3>Friedman, p. 363</ref>\n\n=== Armament ===\n[[File:British gun, skansin (Faroe Islands).jpg|thumb|left|300px|One of the 5.5-inch guns from ''Furious'', redeployed in the Faeroes]]\n''Furious'' retained ten of her original eleven [[breech-loading]] [[BL 5.5 inch Mark I naval gun|BL 5.5-inch Mk I]] guns, five on each side, for self-defence from enemy warships.<ref name=b69 /> They fired {{convert|82|lb|kg|adj=on}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2790|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Their maximum range was {{convert|16000|yd|m}} at their maximum elevation of 25\u00b0, and the rate of fire was 12 rounds per minute.<ref>Campbell, p. 40</ref>\n\nHalf a dozen [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF 4-inch Mark V]] guns replaced her original [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns. Four were mounted on the sides of the flying-off deck and two on the [[quarterdeck]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 267</ref> They had a maximum depression of \u22125\u00b0 and a maximum elevation of 80\u00b0. The guns fired a {{convert|31|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosive]] (HE) shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2387|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 10 to 15 rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|31000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 58</ref> The four guns on the flying-off deck were removed during trials of the lower flight deck in 1926\u20131927, but only two were replaced when the trials were concluded.<ref name=f9>Friedman, p. 109</ref>\n\nFour single [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder ''pom-poms'']] were installed by 1927.<ref name=f9 /> During ''Furious''{{'}}s September 1930 \u2013 February 1932 refit, her anti-aircraft outfit was changed by the substitution of two eight-barrel 2-pounder ''pom-pom'' mounts for the forward 4-inch guns on the flying-off deck removed earlier.<ref name=b69>Burt 2012, p. 276</ref> The Mark V mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 80\u00b0. The Mark VIII 2-pounder gun fired a {{convert|40|mm|adj=on}} {{convert|.91|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1920|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a distance of {{convert|3800|yd|m}}. The gun's rate of fire was approximately 96\u201398 rounds per minute.<ref>Campbell, pp. 71\u201374</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|5.5|in|adj=on}} and {{convert|4|in|adj=on|0}} guns were replaced during ''Furious''{{'}}s refit in early 1939 by a dozen [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|QF 4-inch Mk XVI guns]] in twin [[dual purpose gun|dual-purpose]] Mark XIX mounts. One mount each was on the former flying-off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 268\u201369, 276</ref> The Mark XIX mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 80\u00b0. The Mark XVI gun fired 15\u201320 {{convert|35|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2660|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Against surface targets it had a range of {{convert|19850|yd|m}} and a maximum ceiling of {{convert|31000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 56</ref> Two more Mark V 2-pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island at the same time.<ref name=b69 />\n\nDuring the Second World War, ''Furious'', the only surviving ship of the three, received an eventual total of 22 manually operated automatic [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon]] light anti-aircraft (AA) guns, which replaced the single quadruple Vickers .50-calibre machine gun mount.<ref name=f9 /> The Oerlikon fired a {{convert|.272|lb|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2750|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The maximum ceiling was 10,000 feet and the maximum range was {{convert|4800|yd}} although the effective range was under {{convert|1000|yd}}. The cyclic rate of fire was 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 250 and 320 rounds per minute owing to the need to reload [[magazine (firearms)|magazines]].<ref>Campbell, pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nA mix of single-purpose anti-surface and anti-aircraft guns in various sizes was considered for ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' by the [[Admiralty]], but was ultimately rejected for a dual-purpose armament of sixteen [[QF 4.7 inch Mk VIII naval gun|QF 4.7-inch Mark VIII]] guns in single high-angle mounts. One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair were on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of each ship.<ref name=b83 /> These mounts could depress to \u22125\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 90\u00b0. The Mark VIII guns fired a {{convert|50|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2457|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of eight to twelve rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|32000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less. They had a maximum range of {{convert|16160|yd|m}} against surface targets.<ref>Campbell, p. 51</ref>\n\nDuring refits in the mid-1930s, both ships received multiple 2-pounder ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Courageous'' received three quadruple Mark VII mounts, one on each side of the flying-off deck, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one behind the island on the flight deck (two of these were transferred from the battleship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|05|2}}). ''Glorious'' received three octuple Mark VI mounts in the same locations. Both ships received four water-cooled [[Vickers .50 machine gun|.50-calibre Mark III]] [[machine gun]]s in a single quadruple mounting.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 157, 286</ref> This mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 70\u00b0. The machine guns fired a {{convert|1.326|oz|adj=on}} bullet at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2520|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. This gave the gun a maximum range of about {{convert|5000|yd|m}}, although its effective range was only {{convert|800|yd|m}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 78</ref> Neither ship had any further guns added before they were sunk early in the war,<ref name=f9 /> in 1939 and 1940, respectively.\n\n=== Fire control and radar ===\nTo assist its weapon systems in hitting their target, ''Furious'' was completed with one [[fire-control system]] for each side, with separate [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|directors]] for low-angle and high-angle guns. The 5.5-inch guns were centrally controlled by a [[Frederic Charles Dreyer#Dreyer Fire Control Table|Dreyer Fire-Control Table]] on the lower deck while the 4-inch guns had their mechanical computers next to their directors.<ref name=f5 /> The existing fire-control directors were removed when ''Furious'' received her new dual-purpose 4-inch mountings in 1939. New high-angle directors, including two for the ''pom-poms'', were mounted on top of the new island and on the former lower flight deck. Over the course of the war [[Type 285 radar|Type 285]] gunnery [[radar]]s were mounted on top of the high-angle directors. She also received a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 290|Type 290]] air-search radar.<ref name=f9 />\n\n''Courageous'' was initially fitted only with low-angle directors for her guns, but these were replaced by dual-purpose directors when she was refitted in 1930. (''Glorious'', completed later, had hers from the beginning.) Neither ship was fitted with radar before its early loss.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201386</ref>\n\n=== Protection ===\nLittle armour other than that of the [[barbette]]s was removed during their conversion to aircraft carriers. The transverse bulkheads were carried through the locations of the former barbettes. The flight deck was {{convert|.625|in|mm}} in thickness.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 273, 282</ref>\n\nUnlike other British battlecruisers, the bulk of the armour of the ''Courageous''-class ships was made from [[Ultimate tensile strength|high-tensile]] steel (HTS), a type of steel used structurally in other ships. Their waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] consisted of {{convert|2|in|0}} of HTS covered by a {{convert|1|in|0|adj=on}} thick mild steel skin. It protected roughly the middle two-thirds of the ship with a one-inch extension forward to the two-inch forward transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] well short of the bow. The belt had a height of {{convert|23|ft|m|1}}, of which {{convert|18|in|m|1}} was below the designed waterline. From the former forward barbette, a three-inch bulkhead extended out to the ship's side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the former location of the rear barbette as well. Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from {{convert|0.75|to|3|in}}, thickest over the magazines and the steering gear. After the [[Battle of Jutland]], {{convert|110|LT|t}} of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines.<ref>Burt 1986, pp. 308, 313</ref>\n\nThe [[torpedo bulkhead]]s were increased during building from {{convert|0.75|in}} to {{convert|1.5|in}} in thickness.<ref>Roberts, pp. 54, 106, 113</ref> All three ships were fitted with a shallow [[anti-torpedo bulge]] integral to the hull, which was intended to detonate the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and deflect the underwater explosion to the surface, away from the ship. Later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task and that it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.<ref>Roberts, p. 111</ref>\n\n=== Air groups ===\n[[File:HMS Furious-15.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Furious'' in the mid-1930s with a flight of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers overhead]]\nNormally, ''Furious'' could carry only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this commonly meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters ([[Fairey Flycatcher]]), two of spotters ([[Blackburn Blackburn]] or [[Avro Bison]]), one spotter reconnaissance ([[Fairey III]]D) and two flights of torpedo bombers ([[Blackburn Dart]]). In 1935 there was one squadron of fighters with [[Hawker Nimrod]]s and [[Hawker Osprey]]s, one squadron of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters. During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.<ref name=b69 />\n\n''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' were generally similar except that they carried a total of 48 aircraft. They commonly flew the same types of aircraft as ''Furious'', although they are also known to have flown the [[Fairey Seal]], the [[Blackburn Shark]], and the [[Blackburn Ripon]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 284</ref>\n\n== Pre-war service ==\n''Furious'' was assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher [[floatplane]]s, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily.<ref name=f9 /><ref>Burt 2012, pp. 270\u201372</ref> The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge [[palisade]]s ([[windbreak]]s) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather.<ref name=f5 /><ref>Jenkins, p. 271</ref> The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard ''Furious''.<ref>Jenkins, p. 274</ref>\n\nThe ship was reduced to reserve status on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport from September 1930 to February 1932, focused on refitting her machinery and re-tubing her boilers.<ref name=b0>Burt 2012, p. 270</ref> In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck, the AA armament was revised and water spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 275\u201376</ref> Upon completion she ran a full-power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was {{convert|28.8|kn}} from a total of {{convert|89754|shp}}.<ref name=b0 />\n\n''Furious'' was recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November.<ref name=j6>Jenkins, p. 276</ref> Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] from May to October 1934. ''Furious'' was present at the Coronation [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] on 20 May 1937 for King [[George VI]]. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the [[Munich Crisis]] in September 1938, she embarked Nos. [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801]], [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821]] and [[822 Naval Air Squadron|822 Squadrons]] and joined the fleet at [[Scapa Flow]], before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair.<ref name=\"b69\" /><ref name=j6 />\n\nShe was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted AA guns on her flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, and gave her a small island on the starboard side. ''Furious'' resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 277\u201378</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Courageous (50).jpg|thumb|left|''Courageous'' at anchor (circa 1935)]]\n''Courageous'' was recommissioned on 21 February 1928 and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet from May 1928 to June 1930. She was relieved by ''Glorious'' and refitted from June to August 1930. The ship was assigned to the Atlantic and Home Fleets from 12 August 1930 to December 1938 aside from a temporary attachment to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936. In the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed and she received two hydraulic [[aircraft catapult|catapults]] on the upper flight deck before March 1934. ''Courageous'' was refitted again between October 1935 and June 1936 and received her ''pom-pom'' mounts. She was also present at the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review. She became a training carrier in December 1938 when {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} joined the Home Fleet and continued on that duty until the start of the Second World War.<ref name=b15>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201386, 290</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious anchored.jpg|thumb|right|''Glorious'' at anchor (circa 1934)]]\n''Glorious'' was recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet, but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930. She relieved ''Courageous'' in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939. In a fog on 1 April 1931 ''Glorious'' rammed SS ''Florida'' amidships while steaming at {{convert|16|knots}}. The impact crumpled {{convert|60|ft|1}} of the flying-off deck and forced ''Glorious'' to put into [[Gibdock|Gibraltar]] for temporary repairs. She had to sail to [[Malta Dockyard|Malta]] for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931. Sometime in the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed. She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two catapults, her flight deck was extended to the rear, her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Glorious'' also participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review before returning to the Mediterranean.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201388</ref>\n\n== Second World War ==\n=== ''Courageous'' ===\n[[File:HMS Courageous sinking.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Courageous'' sinking]]\nIn the early days of the war, [[Hunter-killer Group|hunter-killer groups]] were formed around the fleet aircraft carriers to find and destroy U-boats. On 17 September 1939, two torpedoes from {{GS|U-29|1936|2}} turned the tables, and ''Courageous'' became the first British warship sunk in the Second World War. As ''Ark Royal'' had been surprised by a near miss seven days earlier, the fleet carriers were withdrawn from this duty.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n\n=== ''Glorious'' ===\nForce J, including ''Glorious'', was organised to hunt for the {{ship|German pocket battleship|Admiral Graf Spee}} in the Indian Ocean. They were not successful, and ''Glorious'' remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she was transferred to the Mediterranean.\n\n''Glorious'' was recalled to the Home Fleet in April 1940 to provide air cover for British forces landing in [[Norwegian Campaign|Norway]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 285</ref> [[Gloster Gladiators]] of [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]] were flown aboard to be transferred to Norwegian airbases. ''Glorious'' and ''Ark Royal'' arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their organic aircraft attacked targets in the [[Trondheim]] area before ''Glorious'' had to return to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and embark new aircraft. She returned on 1 May, after failing to load new aircraft because of poor weather. The task force was under heavy air attack by the [[Luftwaffe]] all day and was withdrawn that evening.<ref>Haarr, pp. 143\u201354</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' returned on 18 May with six [[Supermarine Walrus]] [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] [[flying boat]]s of [[701 Naval Air Squadron|701 Squadron]] and 18 [[Hawker Hurricane]]s of [[No. 46 Squadron RAF]]. The Walruses were flown off to [[Harstad]], but the airfield at [[Sk\u00e5nland]] was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when ''Glorious'' returned to Scapa on 21 May. ''Glorious'' came back to the [[Narvik]] area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 261\u201362</ref>\n\nBritish forces were ordered withdrawn a few days later. The evacuation (''[[Operation Alphabet]]'') began in the north on the night of 3/4 June, and ''Glorious'' arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She carried only nine Sea Gladiators of [[802 Naval Air Squadron|802 Squadron]] and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of [[823 Naval Air Squadron|823 Squadron]] for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes.<ref>Haarr, pp. 308\u201310</ref> This was the first time that high performance monoplanes without [[tailhook]]s had been landed on an aircraft carrier.<ref name=h61>Howland, p. 61</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Guy D'Oyly-Hughes]] requested and was granted permission to proceed independently to Scapa Flow in the early hours of 8 June. On the way back across the [[North Sea]], ''Glorious'' and her two escorting destroyers, {{HMS|Acasta|H09|2}} and {{HMS|Ardent|H41|2}}, were found by the two German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}.<ref>Haarr, pp. 329\u201330</ref> No [[combat air patrol]] was being flown, no aircraft were spotted on the deck for quick take off and there was no lookout in the [[crow's nest]].<ref>Howland, p. 52</ref> The German heavy ships sank all three British vessels with most of their crews, although ''Acasta'' managed to torpedo ''Scharnhorst'' before she was sunk. Only 43 men from ''Glorious'' survived.<ref>Rohwer, p. 26</ref>\n\n=== ''Furious'' ===\nUntil 2 October 1939, ''Furious'' remained on training duties, combined with anti-submarine sweeps off the east coast of Scotland.<ref>Jenkins, p. 277</ref> She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken ''Courageous'' and sortied on 8 October with the fleet to hunt unsuccessfully for the ''Gneisenau'' and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern Norway. ''Furious'' departed her berth adjacent to the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October, the day before ''Royal Oak'' was sunk by {{GS|U-47|1938|2}} in Scapa Flow. ''Furious'' served as the flagship for the convoy bringing most of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] to Britain in mid-December 1939.<ref>Jenkins, p. 279</ref>\n\n''Furious'' joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the following days. She refuelled at [[Troms\u00f8]] on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April, and the damage was more serious than initially thought. After quick repairs, ''Furious'' returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at [[Bardufoss Air Station|Bardufoss]] was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 139\u201341, 261</ref>\n\nOn 14 June, carrying only half of [[816 Naval Air Squadron|816 Squadron]] for her own protection, ''Furious'' sailed unescorted for [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] carrying \u00a318,000,000 in gold [[bullion]]. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for [[Iceland]] from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft, spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain [[Thomas Hope Troubridge|Troubridge]] ordered all available space should be used for sugar bound for Britain. She reembarked her aircraft upon her arrival and made a number of air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Troms\u00f8 through October 1940.<ref>Jenkins, p. 283</ref> ''Furious'' loaded 55 aircraft in [[Liverpool]] on 7 November and sailed for [[Takoradi]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], on 15 November where the aircraft were flown off on 27 November to reinforce fighter units defending [[Desert Air Force|Egypt]]. By 15 December, ''Furious'' was back in Liverpool, where she embarked 40 Hurricanes for Takoradi. She sailed on 21 December and joined up with [[Convoy WS 5A]] which encountered the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2|up=y}} on 25 December. The German ship was driven off by the escorts, and ''Furious'' reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941. She arrived in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit. She made another ferry trip to Takoradi between 4 and 22 March.<ref>Nailer, pp. 154\u201355</ref>\n\nNow with a new destination for her ferry trips, ''Furious'' transported two dozen Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to ''Ark Royal'' to be flown off for [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Malta]]. She returned for another load of Hurricanes and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to ''Ark Royal'' via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied ''Ark Royal'' and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia. She would repeat this ferry mission three more times from June to September 1941.<ref>Nailer, p. 165</ref> In July and August, ''Furious'' and {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} attacked German installations in the Arctic areas of Norway and Finland with limited success and heavy losses. Following her last ferry mission she was sent to [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, to refit.<ref>Jenkins, p. 284</ref>\n\n[[File:A Supermarine Seafire being brought up onto the flight deck of HMS FURIOUS, August 1944. A25076.jpg|thumb|A [[Supermarine Seafire]] being brought up onto the flight deck of ''Furious'', August 1944]]\n\n''Furious'' arrived back in the UK in April 1942 and spent the next three months [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]]. In August she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in [[Operation Pedestal]], but she was to sail with them only far enough to allow her 38 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s to reach Malta. This she did, just as ''Eagle'' was torpedoed, but ''Furious'' turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the [[Balearic Islands]]. After this mission ''Furious'' was sent back to Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before [[Operation Torch]], and she arrived on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch.<ref>Nailer, pp. 164\u201365</ref>\n\nProviding cover for the Central Task Force, ''Furious''{{'}}s aircraft neutralised the airfields at [[Es S\u00e9nia|La Senia]] and [[Tafraoui]], both near [[Oran]], Algeria. She remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war. In July the Home Fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; ''Furious''{{'}}s role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report then shoot it down.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 284\u201385</ref> She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training.<ref name=b2>Burt 2012, p. 277</ref>\n\nOn 3 April 1944, [[Fairey Barracuda]]s from ''Furious'' and ''Victorious'' attacked the German battleship ''Tirpitz'' in [[Altafjord]], Norway, as part of [[Operation Tungsten]]. ''Tirpitz'' was hit 14 times and needed three months to complete her repairs, although four aircraft were lost in the attack. The Home Fleet tried another attack on ''Tirpitz'' later in the month, but bad weather prevented any attack from being made. Instead the aircraft attempted to attack installations at [[Bod\u00f8]], but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships. Three operations against targets in northern Norway, including two against ''Tirpitz'', had to be abandoned or diverted to other targets in May, but three German ships were sunk and two more were set afire. ''Furious'' and other carriers made another attempt to sink the ''Tirpitz'' on 17 July, but were unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences. Four more attacks on ''Tirpitz'' were made in August, but only the attack on the 24th was even partially successful as two minor hits were made.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 314, 320, 322, 343, 350\u2013351</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed, the ship's age and limitations became increasingly apparent, and ''Furious'' was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. She was [[paid off]] in April 1945 and used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship's structure. She was sold in 1948 for scrap, which was completed in 1954 at [[Troon]].<ref name=b2 />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David|title=HMS Eagle|series=Warship Profile|volume=35|year=1973|publisher=Profile Publications|location=Windsor, Berkshire, UK|oclc=33084560}}\n* {{cite book|last=Burt|first=R.

The three ships\u2014{{HMS|Furious|47|2}}, {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} and {{HMS|Glorious||2}}\u2014were originally laid down as [[Courageous-class battlecruiser]]s as part of the [[Baltic Project]] during the [[Naval warfare of World War I|First World War]]. While very fast, their minimal armour and few guns limited their long-term utility in the post-war Royal Navy, and they were [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|laid up]] after the war. They were considered [[capital ship]]s by the terms of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and were included in the total amount of tonnage allowed to the Royal Navy. Rather than [[ship breaking|scrap]] them, the Navy decided to convert them to aircraft carriers as permitted under the Treaty.\n\n''Furious'', already partially converted during the war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In an attempt to minimize air turbulence, she was given no [[superstructure]] or [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|island]]. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]; instead, her [[boiler]] uptakes ran along the sides of the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the [[flight deck]], or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her [[sister ship|half-sisters]], ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', began their conversions to aircraft carriers as ''Furious'' neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since ''Furious'' had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.\n\nAs the first large carrier completed by the Royal Navy, ''Furious'' was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures, including the first-ever carrier night landing in 1926. ''Courageous'' became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in the Second World War when she was [[torpedo]]ed in September 1939 by a German [[U-boat|submarine]]. ''Glorious'' participated in the [[Norwegian Campaign]] in 1940, but she was sunk by two German [[battleship]]s in June as she sailed home with minimal escort. ''Furious'' participated in many major operations during the war, including the [[Norwegian Campaign]] in 1940, the [[Malta Convoys]] and ''[[Operation Torch]]'' in 1942, and air strikes on the {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz}} and other targets in Norway in 1944. The ship was worn out by 1944 and was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] status in September 1944 before being [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1945 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1948.\n\n== Careers as battlecruisers ==\n{{Main|Courageous-class battlecruiser}}\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious (1917) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|''Glorious'' as a battlecruiser]]\nThe first two ships of the class, ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', spent the First World War on [[North Sea]] patrols, climaxing in the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in November 1917. Their half-sister ''Furious'' was designed with a pair of {{convert|18|in|0|adj=on}} guns\u2014as opposed to four {{convert|15|in|0|adj=on}}\u2014but was modified while being built to hold a flying-off deck and [[hangar]] in lieu of her forward [[gun turret|turret]] and [[barbette]]. She made some patrols in the North Sea before her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added. Her aircraft attacked [[Zeppelin]] sheds during the [[Tondern raid]] in July 1918.<ref>Roberts, p. 123</ref>\n\nAll three ships were reduced to reserve after the war. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the signatory nations to a set amount of capital ship tonnage; all ships in excess of this figure had to be scrapped. Up to {{convert|66000|LT|t}} of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers, and the Royal Navy decided to use the ''Courageous''-class ships due to their high speed. Each ship was reconstructed with a flight deck during the 1920s.<ref>Friedman, p. 97</ref>\n\n== Conversions ==\n[[File:HMS Furious-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Furious'' as she was during the First World War with separate take-off and landing decks and superstructure in between]]\n[[File:Dunning Landing-on Furious In Pup.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Sopwith Pup]] unsuccessfully attempting to land on ''Furious''{{'}}s forward flight deck, 7 August 1917]]\n{{HMS|Furious|47|2}} had been fitted during the First World War with a flying-off and landing deck, but the latter proved largely unusable because of the strong air currents around the superstructure and exhaust gases from the funnel. She was laid up after the war, but was converted to an aircraft carrier between June 1921 and September 1925. Her design was based on the very limited experience gained with the first two British carriers: {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}}, less than three years old, and {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}}, which had carried out only 143 deck landings during preliminary [[sea trial]]s in 1920.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 263\u201367</ref><ref>Burt 2012, p. 252</ref><ref>Brown, p. 252</ref>\n\n''Furious''{{'}}s superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a {{convert|576|by|92|ft|m|1|adj=on}} flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at the time it was designed. That era's fore-and-aft [[arresting gear]], initially {{convert|320|ft|1}} long on ''Furious'', was not intended to stop landing aircraft\u2014the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind\u2014but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges minimised turbulence. To minimise any turbulence over the flight deck, ''Furious'' was flush-decked and lacked an island, like ''Argus''; instead she was provided with a retractable [[Glossary of nautical terms#C|charthouse]] at the forward end of the flight deck.<ref>Friedman, pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nA two-level hangar was built under the flight deck, each level being {{convert|15|ft|1}} high. The lower hangar was {{convert|550|ft|1}} long by {{convert|35|-|50|ft|1}} wide and the upper was {{convert|520|by|50|ft|1}}. Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck, or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 264\u201365</ref> Two {{convert|47|by|46|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. Two {{convert|600|impgal|l USgal|adj=on}} ready-use [[petrol]] tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional {{convert|20000|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol were in bulk storage. The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard ''Furious'' in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side.<ref>Friedman, pp. 94\u201395</ref> ''Furious''{{'}}s long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\">Friedman, pp. 103, 105\u201306</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' and ''Courageous'' were converted to aircraft carriers after ''Furious'' began her reconstruction, ''Courageous'' at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] starting on 29 June 1924, and ''Glorious'' at [[Rosyth]] on 14 February 1924. The latter was moved to Devonport to complete the conversion after ''Furious'' was finished. Their design was based on ''Furious'' with a few improvements based on experience gained since she was designed. All superstructure, guns, and fittings down to the main deck were removed. A two-storey hangar, each level {{convert|16|ft|1}} high and {{convert|550|ft|m|1}} long, was built on top of the remaining hull; the upper hangar level opened onto a short flying-off deck, below and forward of the main flight deck. Two slightly larger {{convert|46|by|48|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck. An island was added on the starboard side with the bridge, flying control station, and funnel, as an island did not create as much turbulence as had been earlier feared. By 1939 both ships could carry {{convert|34500|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\" />\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:HMS Glorious underway 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of ''Glorious'', 1936]]\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|786|ft|9|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|90|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|28|ft|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. These were increases of {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m|1}} in beam and over {{convert|2|ft|m|1}} in draught compared to their earlier incarnations as battlecruisers. They displaced {{convert|24210|LT|t}} at normal load and {{convert|26990|LT|t|abbr=on}} at deep load, increases of over {{convert|3000|LT|t}}. Their [[metacentric height]] declined from {{convert|6|ft|1}} at deep load to {{convert|4.4|ft|1}} and the ships had a complete [[double bottom]].<ref name=r65>Roberts, pp. 64\u201365</ref> In 1939, ''Courageous'' had a complement of 807 officers and enlisted men, plus 403 men in her air group.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 283, 285</ref>\n\nTheir half-sister ''Furious'' was the same length, but had a beam of {{convert|89|ft|0.75|in|m|1}},<ref>Jenkins, front [[endpaper]]</ref> and an average draught of {{convert|27|ft|3|in|m|1}} at deep load, two feet deeper than before the conversion. She displaced {{convert|22500|LT|t}} at normal load and {{convert|26500|LT|t|abbr=on}} at deep load, over 3,000 long tons more than her previous displacement of {{convert|19513|LT|t}} at load and {{convert|22890|LT|t}} at deep load. ''Furious''{{'}}s metacentric height was {{convert|3.6|ft|1}} at deep load, a reduction of {{convert|1.48|ft|1}} after her conversion.<ref name=r65 /> In 1932, ''Furious'' had a complement of 738 officers and enlisted men, plus 468 men in her air group.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 266, 273</ref>\n\n=== Propulsion ===\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared [[steam turbine]]s. Arranged in two engine rooms, each of the turbines drove one of the four propeller shafts. ''Furious''{{'}}s propellers were {{convert|11|ft|6|in|m|1}} in diameter. The turbines were powered by 18 [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] small-tube boilers equally divided among three boiler rooms. The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|90000|shp|lk=in}} at a working pressure of {{convert|235|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref>Roberts, pp. 71, 76</ref> No significant changes to the machinery were made during the conversion process to any of the three ships, but their increased displacement reduced their speed to approximately {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}.<ref name=f5>Friedman, p. 95</ref>\n\n''Furious''{{'}}s fuel capacity was increased by {{convert|700|LT|t}} during her reconstruction, which increased her range to {{convert|7480|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=f3 /> The maximum fuel capacity of ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' was increased during the conversion to {{convert|3800|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]],<ref name=b83>Burt 2012, p. 283</ref> giving them an endurance of {{convert|6630|nmi|lk=in}} at 10 knots.<ref name=f3>Friedman, p. 363</ref>\n\n=== Armament ===\n[[File:British gun, skansin (Faroe Islands).jpg|thumb|left|300px|One of the 5.5-inch guns from ''Furious'', redeployed in the Faeroes]]\n''Furious'' retained ten of her original eleven [[breech-loading]] [[BL 5.5 inch Mark I naval gun|BL 5.5-inch Mk I]] guns, five on each side, for self-defence from enemy warships.<ref name=b69 /> They fired {{convert|82|lb|kg|adj=on}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2790|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.

Four were mounted on the sides of the flying-off deck and two on the [[quarterdeck]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 267</ref> They had a maximum depression of \u22125\u00b0 and a maximum elevation of 80\u00b0. The guns fired a {{convert|31|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosive]] (HE) shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2387|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 10 to 15 rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|31000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 58</ref> The four guns on the flying-off deck were removed during trials of the lower flight deck in 1926\u20131927, but only two were replaced when the trials were concluded.<ref name=f9>Friedman, p. 109</ref>\n\nFour single [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder ''pom-poms'']] were installed by 1927.<ref name=f9 /> During ''Furious''{{'}}s September 1930 \u2013 February 1932 refit, her anti-aircraft outfit was changed by the substitution of two eight-barrel 2-pounder ''pom-pom'' mounts for the forward 4-inch guns on the flying-off deck removed earlier.<ref name=b69>Burt 2012, p. 276</ref> The Mark V mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 80\u00b0. The Mark VIII 2-pounder gun fired a {{convert|40|mm|adj=on}} {{convert|.91|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1920|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a distance of {{convert|3800|yd|m}}. The gun's rate of fire was approximately 96\u201398 rounds per minute.<ref>Campbell, pp. 71\u201374</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|5.5|in|adj=on}} and {{convert|4|in|adj=on|0}} guns were replaced during ''Furious''{{'}}s refit in early 1939 by a dozen [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|QF 4-inch Mk XVI guns]] in twin [[dual purpose gun|dual-purpose]] Mark XIX mounts. One mount each was on the former flying-off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 268\u201369, 276</ref> The Mark XIX mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 80\u00b0. The Mark XVI gun fired 15\u201320 {{convert|35|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2660|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Against surface targets it had a range of {{convert|19850|yd|m}} and a maximum ceiling of {{convert|31000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 56</ref> Two more Mark V 2-pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island at the same time.<ref name=b69 />\n\nDuring the Second World War, ''Furious'', the only surviving ship of the three, received an eventual total of 22 manually operated automatic [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon]] light anti-aircraft (AA) guns, which replaced the single quadruple Vickers .50-calibre machine gun mount.<ref name=f9 /> The Oerlikon fired a {{convert|.272|lb|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2750|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The maximum ceiling was 10,000 feet and the maximum range was {{convert|4800|yd}} although the effective range was under {{convert|1000|yd}}. The cyclic rate of fire was 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 250 and 320 rounds per minute owing to the need to reload [[magazine (firearms)|magazines]].<ref>Campbell, pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nA mix of single-purpose anti-surface and anti-aircraft guns in various sizes was considered for ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' by the [[Admiralty]], but was ultimately rejected for a dual-purpose armament of sixteen [[QF 4.7 inch Mk VIII naval gun|QF 4.7-inch Mark VIII]] guns in single high-angle mounts. One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair were on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of each ship.<ref name=b83 /> These mounts could depress to \u22125\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 90\u00b0. The Mark VIII guns fired a {{convert|50|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2457|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of eight to twelve rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|32000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less. They had a maximum range of {{convert|16160|yd|m}} against surface targets.<ref>Campbell, p. 51</ref>\n\nDuring refits in the mid-1930s, both ships received multiple 2-pounder ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Courageous'' received three quadruple Mark VII mounts, one on each side of the flying-off deck, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one behind the island on the flight deck (two of these were transferred from the battleship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|05|2}}). ''Glorious'' received three octuple Mark VI mounts in the same locations. Both ships received four water-cooled [[Vickers .50 machine gun|.50-calibre Mark III]] [[machine gun]]s in a single quadruple mounting.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 157, 286</ref> This mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 70\u00b0. The machine guns fired a {{convert|1.326|oz|adj=on}} bullet at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2520|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. This gave the gun a maximum range of about {{convert|5000|yd|m}}, although its effective range was only {{convert|800|yd|m}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 78</ref> Neither ship had any further guns added before they were sunk early in the war,<ref name=f9 /> in 1939 and 1940, respectively.\n\n=== Fire control and radar ===\nTo assist its weapon systems in hitting their target, ''Furious'' was completed with one [[fire-control system]] for each side, with separate [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|directors]] for low-angle and high-angle guns. The 5.5-inch guns were centrally controlled by a [[Frederic Charles Dreyer#Dreyer Fire Control Table|Dreyer Fire-Control Table]] on the lower deck while the 4-inch guns had their mechanical computers next to their directors.<ref name=f5 /> The existing fire-control directors were removed when ''Furious'' received her new dual-purpose 4-inch mountings in 1939. New high-angle directors, including two for the ''pom-poms'', were mounted on top of the new island and on the former lower flight deck. Over the course of the war [[Type 285 radar|Type 285]] gunnery [[radar]]s were mounted on top of the high-angle directors. She also received a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 290|Type 290]] air-search radar.<ref name=f9 />\n\n''Courageous'' was initially fitted only with low-angle directors for her guns, but these were replaced by dual-purpose directors when she was refitted in 1930. (''Glorious'', completed later, had hers from the beginning.) Neither ship was fitted with radar before its early loss.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201386</ref>\n\n=== Protection ===\nLittle armour other than that of the [[barbette]]s was removed during their conversion to aircraft carriers. The transverse bulkheads were carried through the locations of the former barbettes. The flight deck was {{convert|.625|in|mm}} in thickness.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 273, 282</ref>\n\nUnlike other British battlecruisers, the bulk of the armour of the ''Courageous''-class ships was made from [[Ultimate tensile strength|high-tensile]] steel (HTS), a type of steel used structurally in other ships. Their waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] consisted of {{convert|2|in|0}} of HTS covered by a {{convert|1|in|0|adj=on}} thick mild steel skin. It protected roughly the middle two-thirds of the ship with a one-inch extension forward to the two-inch forward transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] well short of the bow. The belt had a height of {{convert|23|ft|m|1}}, of which {{convert|18|in|m|1}} was below the designed waterline. From the former forward barbette, a three-inch bulkhead extended out to the ship's side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the former location of the rear barbette as well. Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from {{convert|0.75|to|3|in}}, thickest over the magazines and the steering gear. After the [[Battle of Jutland]], {{convert|110|LT|t}} of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines.<ref>Burt 1986, pp. 308, 313</ref>\n\nThe [[torpedo bulkhead]]s were increased during building from {{convert|0.75|in}} to {{convert|1.5|in}} in thickness.<ref>Roberts, pp. 54, 106, 113</ref> All three ships were fitted with a shallow [[anti-torpedo bulge]] integral to the hull, which was intended to detonate the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and deflect the underwater explosion to the surface, away from the ship. Later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task and that it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.<ref>Roberts, p. 111</ref>\n\n=== Air groups ===\n[[File:HMS Furious-15.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Furious'' in the mid-1930s with a flight of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers overhead]]\nNormally, ''Furious'' could carry only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this commonly meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters ([[Fairey Flycatcher]]), two of spotters ([[Blackburn Blackburn]] or [[Avro Bison]]), one spotter reconnaissance ([[Fairey III]]D) and two flights of torpedo bombers ([[Blackburn Dart]]). In 1935 there was one squadron of fighters with [[Hawker Nimrod]]s and [[Hawker Osprey]]s, one squadron of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters. During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.<ref name=b69 />\n\n''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' were generally similar except that they carried a total of 48 aircraft. They commonly flew the same types of aircraft as ''Furious'', although they are also known to have flown the [[Fairey Seal]], the [[Blackburn Shark]], and the [[Blackburn Ripon]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 284</ref>\n\n== Pre-war service ==\n''Furious'' was assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher [[floatplane]]s, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily.<ref name=f9 /><ref>Burt 2012, pp. 270\u201372</ref> The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge [[palisade]]s ([[windbreak]]s) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather.<ref name=f5 /><ref>Jenkins, p. 271</ref> The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard ''Furious''.<ref>Jenkins, p. 274</ref>\n\nThe ship was reduced to reserve status on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport from September 1930 to February 1932, focused on refitting her machinery and re-tubing her boilers.<ref name=b0>Burt 2012, p. 270</ref> In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck, the AA armament was revised and water spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 275\u201376</ref> Upon completion she ran a full-power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was {{convert|28.8|kn}} from a total of {{convert|89754|shp}}.<ref name=b0 />\n\n''Furious'' was recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November.<ref name=j6>Jenkins, p. 276</ref> Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] from May to October 1934. ''Furious'' was present at the Coronation [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] on 20 May 1937 for King [[George VI]]. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the [[Munich Crisis]] in September 1938, she embarked Nos. [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801]], [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821]] and [[822 Naval Air Squadron|822 Squadrons]] and joined the fleet at [[Scapa Flow]], before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair.<ref name=\"b69\" /><ref name=j6 />\n\nShe was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted AA guns on her flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, and gave her a small island on the starboard side. ''Furious'' resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 277\u201378</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Courageous (50).jpg|thumb|left|''Courageous'' at anchor (circa 1935)]]\n''Courageous'' was recommissioned on 21 February 1928 and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet from May 1928 to June 1930. She was relieved by ''Glorious'' and refitted from June to August 1930. The ship was assigned to the Atlantic and Home Fleets from 12 August 1930 to December 1938 aside from a temporary attachment to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936. In the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed and she received two hydraulic [[aircraft catapult|catapults]] on the upper flight deck before March 1934. ''Courageous'' was refitted again between October 1935 and June 1936 and received her ''pom-pom'' mounts. She was also present at the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review. She became a training carrier in December 1938 when {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} joined the Home Fleet and continued on that duty until the start of the Second World War.<ref name=b15>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201386, 290</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious anchored.jpg|thumb|right|''Glorious'' at anchor (circa 1934)]]\n''Glorious'' was recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet, but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930. She relieved ''Courageous'' in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939. In a fog on 1 April 1931 ''Glorious'' rammed SS ''Florida'' amidships while steaming at {{convert|16|knots}}. The impact crumpled {{convert|60|ft|1}} of the flying-off deck and forced ''Glorious'' to put into [[Gibdock|Gibraltar]] for temporary repairs. She had to sail to [[Malta Dockyard|Malta]] for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931. Sometime in the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed. She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two catapults, her flight deck was extended to the rear, her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Glorious'' also participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review before returning to the Mediterranean.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201388</ref>\n\n== Second World War ==\n=== ''Courageous'' ===\n[[File:HMS Courageous sinking.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Courageous'' sinking]]\nIn the early days of the war, [[Hunter-killer Group|hunter-killer groups]] were formed around the fleet aircraft carriers to find and destroy U-boats. On 17 September 1939, two torpedoes from {{GS|U-29|1936|2}} turned the tables, and ''Courageous'' became the first British warship sunk in the Second World War. As ''Ark Royal'' had been surprised by a near miss seven days earlier, the fleet carriers were withdrawn from this duty.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n\n=== ''Glorious'' ===\nForce J, including ''Glorious'', was organised to hunt for the {{ship|German pocket battleship|Admiral Graf Spee}} in the Indian Ocean. They were not successful, and ''Glorious'' remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she was transferred to the Mediterranean.\n\n''Glorious'' was recalled to the Home Fleet in April 1940 to provide air cover for British forces landing in [[Norwegian Campaign|Norway]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 285</ref> [[Gloster Gladiators]] of [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]] were flown aboard to be transferred to Norwegian airbases. ''Glorious'' and ''Ark Royal'' arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their organic aircraft attacked targets in the [[Trondheim]] area before ''Glorious'' had to return to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and embark new aircraft. She returned on 1 May, after failing to load new aircraft because of poor weather. The task force was under heavy air attack by the [[Luftwaffe]] all day and was withdrawn that evening.<ref>Haarr, pp. 143\u201354</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' returned on 18 May with six [[Supermarine Walrus]] [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] [[flying boat]]s of [[701 Naval Air Squadron|701 Squadron]] and 18 [[Hawker Hurricane]]s of [[No. 46 Squadron RAF]]. The Walruses were flown off to [[Harstad]], but the airfield at [[Sk\u00e5nland]] was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when ''Glorious'' returned to Scapa on 21 May. ''Glorious'' came back to the [[Narvik]] area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 261\u201362</ref>\n\nBritish forces were ordered withdrawn a few days later. The evacuation (''[[Operation Alphabet]]'') began in the north on the night of 3/4 June, and ''Glorious'' arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She carried only nine Sea Gladiators of [[802 Naval Air Squadron|802 Squadron]] and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of [[823 Naval Air Squadron|823 Squadron]] for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes.<ref>Haarr, pp. 308\u201310</ref> This was the first time that high performance monoplanes without [[tailhook]]s had been landed on an aircraft carrier.<ref name=h61>Howland, p. 61</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Guy D'Oyly-Hughes]] requested and was granted permission to proceed independently to Scapa Flow in the early hours of 8 June. On the way back across the [[North Sea]], ''Glorious'' and her two escorting destroyers, {{HMS|Acasta|H09|2}} and {{HMS|Ardent|H41|2}}, were found by the two German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}.<ref>Haarr, pp. 329\u201330</ref> No [[combat air patrol]] was being flown, no aircraft were spotted on the deck for quick take off and there was no lookout in the [[crow's nest]].<ref>Howland, p. 52</ref> The German heavy ships sank all three British vessels with most of their crews, although ''Acasta'' managed to torpedo ''Scharnhorst'' before she was sunk. Only 43 men from ''Glorious'' survived.<ref>Rohwer, p. 26</ref>\n\n=== ''Furious'' ===\nUntil 2 October 1939, ''Furious'' remained on training duties, combined with anti-submarine sweeps off the east coast of Scotland.<ref>Jenkins, p. 277</ref> She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken ''Courageous'' and sortied on 8 October with the fleet to hunt unsuccessfully for the ''Gneisenau'' and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern Norway. ''Furious'' departed her berth adjacent to the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October, the day before ''Royal Oak'' was sunk by {{GS|U-47|1938|2}} in Scapa Flow. ''Furious'' served as the flagship for the convoy bringing most of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] to Britain in mid-December 1939.<ref>Jenkins, p. 279</ref>\n\n''Furious'' joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the following days. She refuelled at [[Troms\u00f8]] on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April, and the damage was more serious than initially thought. After quick repairs, ''Furious'' returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at [[Bardufoss Air Station|Bardufoss]] was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 139\u201341, 261</ref>\n\nOn 14 June, carrying only half of [[816 Naval Air Squadron|816 Squadron]] for her own protection, ''Furious'' sailed unescorted for [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] carrying \u00a318,000,000 in gold [[bullion]]. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for [[Iceland]] from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft, spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain [[Thomas Hope Troubridge|Troubridge]] ordered all available space should be used for sugar bound for Britain. She reembarked her aircraft upon her arrival and made a number of air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Troms\u00f8 through October 1940.<ref>Jenkins, p. 283</ref> ''Furious'' loaded 55 aircraft in [[Liverpool]] on 7 November and sailed for [[Takoradi]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], on 15 November where the aircraft were flown off on 27 November to reinforce fighter units defending [[Desert Air Force|Egypt]]. By 15 December, ''Furious'' was back in Liverpool, where she embarked 40 Hurricanes for Takoradi. She sailed on 21 December and joined up with [[Convoy WS 5A]] which encountered the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2|up=y}} on 25 December. The German ship was driven off by the escorts, and ''Furious'' reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941. She arrived in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit. She made another ferry trip to Takoradi between 4 and 22 March.<ref>Nailer, pp. 154\u201355</ref>\n\nNow with a new destination for her ferry trips, ''Furious'' transported two dozen Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to ''Ark Royal'' to be flown off for [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Malta]]. She returned for another load of Hurricanes and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to ''Ark Royal'' via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied ''Ark Royal'' and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia. She would repeat this ferry mission three more times from June to September 1941.<ref>Nailer, p. 165</ref> In July and August, ''Furious'' and {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} attacked German installations in the Arctic areas of Norway and Finland with limited success and heavy losses. Following her last ferry mission she was sent to [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, to refit.<ref>Jenkins, p. 284</ref>\n\n[[File:A Supermarine Seafire being brought up onto the flight deck of HMS FURIOUS, August 1944. A25076.jpg|thumb|A [[Supermarine Seafire]] being brought up onto the flight deck of ''Furious'', August 1944]]\n\n''Furious'' arrived back in the UK in April 1942 and spent the next three months [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]]. In August she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in [[Operation Pedestal]], but she was to sail with them only far enough to allow her 38 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s to reach Malta. This she did, just as ''Eagle'' was torpedoed, but ''Furious'' turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the [[Balearic Islands]]. After this mission ''Furious'' was sent back to Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before [[Operation Torch]], and she arrived on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch.<ref>Nailer, pp. 164\u201365</ref>\n\nProviding cover for the Central Task Force, ''Furious''{{'}}s aircraft neutralised the airfields at [[Es S\u00e9nia|La Senia]] and [[Tafraoui]], both near [[Oran]], Algeria. She remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war. In July the Home Fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; ''Furious''{{'}}s role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report then shoot it down.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 284\u201385</ref> She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training.<ref name=b2>Burt 2012, p. 277</ref>\n\nOn 3 April 1944, [[Fairey Barracuda]]s from ''Furious'' and ''Victorious'' attacked the German battleship ''Tirpitz'' in [[Altafjord]], Norway, as part of [[Operation Tungsten]]. ''Tirpitz'' was hit 14 times and needed three months to complete her repairs, although four aircraft were lost in the attack. The Home Fleet tried another attack on ''Tirpitz'' later in the month, but bad weather prevented any attack from being made. Instead the aircraft attempted to attack installations at [[Bod\u00f8]], but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships. Three operations against targets in northern Norway, including two against ''Tirpitz'', had to be abandoned or diverted to other targets in May, but three German ships were sunk and two more were set afire. ''Furious'' and other carriers made another attempt to sink the ''Tirpitz'' on 17 July, but were unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences. Four more attacks on ''Tirpitz'' were made in August, but only the attack on the 24th was even partially successful as two minor hits were made.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 314, 320, 322, 343, 350\u2013351</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed, the ship's age and limitations became increasingly apparent, and ''Furious'' was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. She was [[paid off]] in April 1945 and used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship's structure. She was sold in 1948 for scrap, which was completed in 1954 at [[Troon]].<ref name=b2 />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David|title=HMS Eagle|series=Warship Profile|volume=35|year=1973|publisher=Profile Publications|location=Windsor, Berkshire, UK|oclc=33084560}}\n* {{cite book|last=Burt|first=R.

All but one of the lanthanides are [[f-block]] elements, corresponding to the filling of the 4f [[electron shell]]; depending on the source, either [[lanthanum]] or [[lutetium]] is considered a [[d-block]] element, but is included due to its chemical similarities with the other 14.<ref>[http://chemistry.tutorvista.com/inorganic-chemistry/f-block-elements.html F Block Elements, Oxidation States, Lanthanides and Actinides]. Chemistry.tutorvista.com. Retrieved on 2017-12-14.</ref> All lanthanide elements form trivalent cations, Ln<sup>3+</sup>, whose chemistry is largely determined by the [[ionic radius]], which [[lanthanide contraction|decreases steadily]] from lanthanum to lutetium.\n\nThey are called lanthanides because the elements in the series are chemically similar to [[lanthanum]]. Both [[lanthanum]] and [[lutetium]] have been labeled as [[group 3 element]]s, because they have a single [[valence electron]] in the 5d shell. However, both elements are often included in discussions of the chemistry of lanthanide elements. Lanthanum is the more often omitted of the two, because its placement as a group 3 element is somewhat more common in texts and for semantic reasons: since \"lanthanide\" means \"like lanthanum\", it has been argued that lanthanum cannot logically be a lanthanide, but IUPAC acknowledges its inclusion based on common usage.<ref name=Greenwood&Earnshaw/>\n\nIn presentations of the [[periodic table]], the lanthanides and the [[actinide]]s are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table,<ref name=\"Gray\" /> with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series (either [[lanthanum]] and [[actinium]], or [[lutetium]] and [[lawrencium]]) shown in a single cell of the main table, between [[barium]] and [[hafnium]], and [[radium]] and [[rutherfordium]], respectively. This convention is entirely a matter of [[aesthetics]] and formatting practicality; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places, as parts of the table's sixth and seventh rows (periods).\n\nThe 1985 [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] \u201cRed Book\u201d (p.&nbsp;45) recommends that ''\"lanthanoid\"'' is used rather than ''\"lanthanide\"''. The ending \u201c-ide\u201d normally indicates a negative ion. However, owing to wide current use, \u201clanthanide\u201d is still allowed.\n{{Periodic table (lanthanides)}}\n\n==Etymology==\nTogether with the two elements at the top of group 3, [[scandium]] and [[yttrium]], the [[trivial name]] \"[[rare earths]]\" is sometimes used to describe all the lanthanides; a definition of rare earths including the group 3, lanthanide, and [[actinide]] elements is also occasionally seen, and rarely Sc + Y + lanthanides + thorium.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The \"earth\" in the name \"rare earths\" arises from the minerals from which they were isolated, which were uncommon oxide-type minerals. However, the use of the name is deprecated by [[IUPAC]], as the elements are neither rare in abundance nor \"earths\" (an obsolete term for water-insoluble strongly basic [[oxide]]s of electropositive metals incapable of being smelted into metal using late 18th century technology). Group 2 is known as the [[alkaline earth]] elements for much the same reason.\n\nThe \"rare\" in the \"rare earths\" name has much more to do with the difficulty of separating out each of the individual lanthanide elements than scarcity of any of them. By way of the Greek \"dysprositos\" for \"hard to get at,\" element 66, [[dysprosium]] was similarly named; lanthanum itself is named after a word for \"hidden.\" The elements 57 (La) to 71 (Lu) are very similar chemically to one another and frequently occur together in nature, often anywhere from three to all 15 of the lanthanides (along with yttrium as a 16th) occur in minerals such as [[samarskite]], [[monazite]] and many others which can also contain the other two group 3 elements as well as thorium and occasionally other actinides as well.<ref name=\"autoRefA\">\"The Elements\", Theodore Gray, Black\u2212Dog & Leventhal, Chicago 2007: \"Lanthanum\" and \"Cerium\" entries Ch 57 & 58, pp 134-7</ref>  A majority of the rare earths were discovered at the same mine in [[Ytterby, Sweden]] and four of them are named (yttrium, ytterbium, erbium, terbium) after the city and a fifth *(holmium) after Stockholm; scandium is named after [[Scandinavia]], [[thulium]] after the old name [[Thule]], and the immediately-following group 4 element (number 72) [[hafnium]] is named for the Latin name of the city of [[Copenhagen]].<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\nSamarskite (a mineral which is the source of the name of the element [[samarium]]) and other similar minerals in particular also have these elements in association with the nearby metals [[tantalum]], [[niobium]], [[hafnium]], [[zirconium]], [[vanadium]], and [[titanium]], from [[Group 4 element|group 4]] and [[Group 5 element|group 5]] often in similar oxidation states. Monazite is a phosphate of numerous group 3 + lanthanide + actinide metals and mined especially for the thorium content and specific rare earths especially lanthanum, yttrium and cerium. Cerium and lanthanum as well as other members of the rare earth series are often produced as a metal called [[mischmetal]] containing a variable mixture of these elements with cerium and lanthanum predominating; it has direct uses such as lighter flints and other spark sources which do not require extensive purification of one of these metals.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />  There are also rare earth-bearing minerals based on group 2 elements such as yttrocalcite, [[yttrocerite]], yttrofluorite which vary in content of yttrium, cerium, and lanthanum in a particular as well as varying amounts of the others.<ref>Rocks & Minerals, A Guide To Field Identification, Sorrell, St Martin's Press 1972, 1995, pp 118 (Halides), 228 (Carbonates)</ref> Other lanthanide/rare earth minerals include [[bastn\u00e4site]], [[florencite]], chernovite, [[perovskite]], [[xenotime]], [[cerite]], [[gadolinite]], [[lanthanite]], [[fergusonite]], [[polycrase]], [[blomstrandine]], [[H\u00e5leniusite-(La)|h\u00e5leniusite]], miserite, [[loparite]], [[Lepersonnite-(Gd)|lepersonnite]], [[euxenite]], all of which have a range of relative element concentration and may have the symbol of a predominating one such as monazite-ce; group 3 elements do not occur as [[native element]] minerals in the fashion of gold, silver, tantalum and many others on earth but may in [[lunar regolith]].

Despite their abundance, even the technical term \"lanthanides\" could be interpreted to reflect a sense of elusiveness on the part of these elements, as it comes from the Greek \u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''lanthanein''), \"to lie hidden\". However, if not referring to their natural abundance, but rather to their property of \"hiding\" behind each other in minerals, this interpretation is in fact appropriate. The etymology of the term must be sought in the first discovery of [[lanthanum]], at that time a so-called new [[rare earth element]] \"lying hidden\" in a [[cerium]] mineral, and it is an irony that [[lanthanum]] was later identified as the first in an entire series of chemically similar elements and could give name to the whole series. The term \"lanthanide\" was introduced by [[Victor Goldschmidt]] in 1925.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed029p581.2|title=Letters|year=1952|last1=Hakala|first1=Reino W.|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=29|issue=11|page=581|bibcode = 1952JChEd..29..581H }}</ref>\n\n==Physical properties of the elements==\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n![[Chemical element]]!![[Lanthanum|La]]!![[Cerium|Ce]]!![[praseodymium|Pr]]!![[neodymium|Nd]]!![[promethium|Pm]]!![[samarium|Sm]]!![[europium|Eu]]!![[gadolinium|Gd]]!![[terbium|Tb]]!![[dysprosium|Dy]]!![[holmium|Ho]]!![[erbium|Er]]!![[thulium|Tm]]!![[ytterbium|Yb]]!![[lutetium|Lu]]\n|-\n| [[Atomic number]]\n|57||58||59||60||61||62||63||64||65||66||67||68||69||70||71\n|-\n|Image|| [[File:Lanthanum-2.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Cerium2.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Praseodymium.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Neodymium2.jpg|50px]]|| ||[[File:Samarium-2.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Europium.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Gadolinium-4.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Terbium-2.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Dy chips.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Holmium2.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Erbium-crop.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Thulium sublimed dendritic and 1cm3 cube.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Ytterbium-3.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Lutetium sublimed dendritic and 1cm3 cube.jpg|50px]]\n|-\n|Density (g/cm<sup>3</sup>)\n|6.162 ||6.770 ||6.77 ||7.01 ||7.26 ||7.52 ||5.244 ||7.90 ||8.23 ||8.540 ||8.79 ||9.066 ||9.32 ||6.90 ||9.841\n|-\n|Melting point (\u00b0C)\n|920 ||795 ||935 ||1024 ||1042 ||1072 ||826 ||1312 ||1356 ||1407 ||1461 ||1529 ||1545 ||824 ||1652\n|-\n|Boiling point (\u00b0C)\n|3464 ||3443 ||3520 ||3074 ||3000 ||1794 ||1529 ||3273 ||3230 ||2567 ||2720 ||2868 ||1950 ||1196 ||3402\n|-\n| Atomic [[electron configuration]]<br>(gas phase)*||'''5d<sup>1</sup>'''||4f<sup>1</sup>'''5d<sup>1</sup>'''||4f<sup>3</sup>|| 4f<sup>4</sup>|| 4f<sup>5</sup>||4f<sup>6</sup>|| 4f<sup>7</sup>|| 4f<sup>7</sup>'''5d<sup>1</sup>'''||4f<sup>9</sup>||4f<sup>10</sup>|| 4f<sup>11</sup>||4f<sup>12</sup>||4f<sup>13</sup>||4f<sup>14</sup>||4f<sup>14</sup>'''5d<sup>1</sup>'''\n|-\n| Atomic electron configuration<br>(solid phase)*||5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>1</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>2</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>3</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>4</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>5</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>7</sup>||4f<sup>7</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>8</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>9</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>10</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>11</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>12</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>14</sup>||4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>\n|-\n|Metal lattice (RT)\n|dhcp ||fcc ||dhcp ||dhcp ||dhcp ||** ||bcc ||hcp ||hcp ||hcp ||hcp||hcp ||hcp ||fcc ||hcp\n|-\n|Metallic radius (pm)\n|  162 || 181.8  ||182.4  ||181.4  ||183.4   ||180.4  ||208.4  ||180.4  ||177.3  ||178.1  ||176.2  ||176.1  ||175.9 ||193.3  ||173.8\n|-\n|Resistivity at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u03bc\u03a9\u00b7cm)\n| 57\u201380<br>20&nbsp;\u00b0C  || 73  ||68   ||64  ||    || 88  ||90  ||134  || 114  ||57  ||87  ||87  ||79  ||29  ||79\n|-\n|[[Magnetic susceptibility]]<br>\u03c7<sub>mol</sub> /10<sup>\u22126</sup>([[cubic centimeter|cm<sup>3</sup>]]\u00b7[[Mole (unit)|mol]]<sup>\u22121</sup>)\n||+95.9 ||+2500 (\u03b2)||+5530(\u03b1)||+5930 (\u03b1)|| ||+1278(\u03b1)||+30900||+185000<br>(350 K)||+170000 (\u03b1)||+98000||+72900||+48000||+24700||+67 (\u03b2)||+183\n|}\n</center>\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Between initial [[Xenon|Xe]] and final 6s<sup>2</sup> electronic shells\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Sm has a close packed structure like the other lanthanides but has an unusual 9 layer repeat\n\nGschneider and Daane (1988) attribute the trend in melting point which increases across the series, ([[lanthanum]] (920&nbsp;\u00b0C) \u2013 lutetium (1622&nbsp;\u00b0C)) to the extent of hybridization of the 6s, 5d, and 4f orbitals.

However, transition metals are able to use [[vibronic coupling]] to break this rule. The valence orbitals in lanthanides are almost entirely non-bonding and as such little effective vibronic coupling takes, hence the spectra from f \u2192 f transitions are much weaker and narrower than those from d \u2192 d transitions. In general this makes the colors of lanthanide complexes far fainter than those of transition metal complexes. f \u2192 f transitions are not possible for the f<sup>1</sup> and f<sup>13</sup> configurations of Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Yb<sup>3+</sup> and thus these ions are colorless in aqueous solution.<ref>{{Ullmann|volume=31|page=191|last1=McGill|first1=Ian|contribution=Rare Earth Elements|doi=10.1002/14356007.a22_607}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Approximate colors of lanthanide ions in aqueous solution<ref name = \"Greenwood&Earnshaw\"/><ref name=\"HOWI1\">[[#Holleman|Holleman]], p.&nbsp;1937.</ref><ref name=\"dtv1\">dtv-Atlas zur Chemie '''1981''', Vol. 1, p.&nbsp;220.</ref>\n| style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Oxidation state\n| 57 || 58 || 59 || 60 || 61 || 62 || 63 || 64 || 65 || 66 || 67 || 68 || 69 || 70 || 71\n|-\n| +2|| || || || ||\n| style=\"background:#d00;\"| <span style=\"color:white\">'''Sm<sup>2+</sup>'''</span> || '''Eu<sup>2+</sup>'''\n|| || || || ||\n| style=\"background:#d07;\"| <span style=\"color:white\">'''Tm<sup>2+</sup>'''</span>\n| style=\"background:#cf0;\"| '''Yb<sup>2+</sup>''' ||\n|-\n| +3|| '''La<sup>3+</sup>''' || '''Ce<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#cf0;\"| '''Pr<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#b0d;\"| <span style=\"color:white\">'''Nd<sup>3+</sup>'''</span>\n| style=\"background:#d0d;\"| <span style=\"color:white\">'''Pm<sup>3+</sup>'''</span>\n| style=\"background:#fe0;\"| '''Sm<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| '''Eu<sup>3+</sup>''' || '''Gd<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#fee;\"| '''Tb<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#cf0;\"| '''Dy<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#ff0;\"| '''Ho<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#e0d;\"| <span style=\"color:white\">'''Er<sup>3+</sup>'''</span>\n| style=\"background:#ef0;\"| '''Tm<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| '''Yb<sup>3+</sup>''' || '''Lu<sup>3+</sup>'''\n|-\n| +4|| || style=\"background:#fd0;\"| '''Ce<sup>4+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#ff0;\"| '''Pr<sup>4+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#70d;\"| <span style=\"color:white\">'''Nd<sup>4+</sup>'''</span> || || || ||\n| style=\"background:#d60;\"| '''Tb<sup>4+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#fd0;\"| '''Dy<sup>4+</sup>''' || || || || ||\n|}</center>\n\n===Effect of 4f orbitals===\nGoing across the lanthanides in the periodic table, the 4f orbitals are usually being filled. The effect of the 4f orbitals on the chemistry of the lanthanides is profound and is the factor that distinguishes them from the [[transition metal]]s. There are seven 4f orbitals, and there are two different ways in which they are depicted: as a \"cubic set\" or as a general set. The [[atomic orbitals|cubic set]] is ''f''<sub>''z<sup>3</sup>''</sub>,  ''f''<sub>''xz<sup>2</sup>''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''yz<sup>2</sup>''</sub>,  ''f''<sub>''xyz''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''z(x<sup>2</sup>\u2212y<sup>2</sup>)''</sub>,  ''f''<sub>''x(x<sup>2</sup>\u22123y<sup>2</sup>)''</sub> and ''f''<sub>''y(3x<sup>2</sup>\u2212y<sup>2</sup>)''</sub>. The 4f orbitals penetrate the [Xe] core and are isolated, and thus they do not participate in bonding. This explains why crystal field effects are small and why they do not form \u03c0 bonds.<ref name=CottonSA2006/> As there are seven 4f orbitals, the number of unpaired electrons can be as high as 7, which gives rise to the large [[magnetochemistry|magnetic moments]] observed for lanthanide compounds. Measuring the magnetic moment can be used to investigate the 4f electron configuration, and this is a useful tool in providing an insight into the chemical bonding.<ref name=\"BochkarevFedushkin1997\">{{cite journal|last1=Bochkarev|first1=Mikhail N.|last2=Fedushkin|first2=Igor L.|last3=Fagin|first3=Anatoly A.|last4=Petrovskaya|first4=Tatyana V.|last5=Ziller|first5=Joseph W.|last6=Broomhall-Dillard|first6=Randy N.

In aluminium the sum of the first three ionization energies is 5139 kJ\u00b7mol<sup>\u22121</sup>, whereas the lanthanides fall in the range 3455 \u2013 4186 kJ\u00b7mol<sup>\u22121</sup>. This correlates with the highly reactive nature of the lanthanides.\n\nThe sum of the first two ionization energies for europium, 1632 kJ\u00b7mol<sup>\u22121</sup> can be compared with that of barium 1468.1 kJ\u00b7mol<sup>\u22121</sup> and europium's third ionization energy is the highest of the lanthanides. The sum of the first two ionization energies for ytterbium are the second lowest in the series and its third ionization energy is the second highest. The high third ionization energy for Eu and Yb correlate with the half filling 4f<sup>7</sup> and complete filling 4f<sup>14</sup> of the 4f subshell, and the stability afforded by such configurations due to exchange energy.<ref name=CottonSA2006/> Europium and ytterbium form salt like compounds with Eu<sup>2+</sup> and Yb<sup>2+</sup>, for example the salt like dihydrides.<ref name=\"Fukai\"/> Both europium and ytterbium dissolve in liquid ammonia forming solutions of Ln<sup>2+</sup>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x</sub> again demonstrating their similarities to the alkaline earth metals.<ref name = \"Greenwood&Earnshaw\"/>\n\nThe relative ease with which the 4th electron can be removed in cerium and (to a lesser extent praseodymium) indicates why Ce(IV) and Pr(IV) compounds can be formed, for example CeO<sub>2</sub> is formed rather than Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> when cerium reacts with oxygen.\n\n===Separation of lanthanides===\nThe similarity in ionic radius between adjacent lanthanide elements makes it difficult to separate them from each other in naturally occurring ores and other mixtures. Historically, the very laborious processes of [[Cascade (chemical engineering)|cascading]] and [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallization]] were used. Because the lanthanide ions have slightly different radii, the [[lattice energy]] of their salts and hydration energies of the ions will be slightly different, leading to a small difference in [[solubility]]. Salts of the formula Ln(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>\u00b72NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>\u00b74H<sub>2</sub>O can be used. Industrially, the elements are separated from each other by [[solvent extraction]]. Typically an aqueous solution of nitrates is extracted into kerosene containing [[Tributyl phosphate|tri-''n''-butylphosphate]]. The [[stability constants of complexes|strength of the complexes]] formed increases as the ionic radius decreases, so solubility in the organic phase increases. Complete separation can be achieved continuously by use of [[countercurrent exchange]] methods. The elements can also be separated by [[ion-exchange chromatography]], making use of the fact that the [[stability constants of complexes|stability constant]] for formation of [[EDTA]] complexes increases for log K \u2248 15.5 for [La(EDTA)]<sup>\u2212</sup> to log K \u2248 19.8 for [Lu(EDTA)]<sup>\u2212</sup>.<ref name = \"Greenwood&Earnshaw\"/><ref>Pettit, L. and Powell, K.

Thus lanthanide [[coordination complex|complexes]] typically have little or no [[covalent bond|covalent]] character and are not influenced by orbital geometries. The lack of orbital interaction also means that varying the metal typically has little effect on the complex (other than size), especially when compared to [[transition metals]]. Complexes are held together by weaker [[ionic bond|electrostatic]] forces which are omni-directional and thus the ligands alone dictate the [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] and coordination of complexes. [[Steric effects|Steric factors]] therefore dominate, with coordinative saturation of the metal being balanced against inter-ligand repulsion. This results in a diverse range of [[Coordination geometry|coordination geometries]], many of which are irregular,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dehnicke|first=Kurt|last2==Greiner|first2=Andreas|title=Unusual Complex Chemistry of Rare-Earth Elements: Large Ionic Radii\u2014Small Coordination Numbers|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|year=2003|volume=42|issue=12|pages=1340\u20131354|doi=10.1002/anie.200390346|pmid=12671966}}</ref> and also manifests itself in the highly [[fluxional]] nature of the complexes. As there is no energetic reason to be locked into a single geometry, rapid intramolecular and intermolecular ligand exchange will take place. This typically results in complexes that rapidly fluctuate between all possible configurations.\n\nMany of these features make lanthanide complexes effective [[catalyst]]s. Hard Lewis acids are able to polarise bonds upon coordination and thus alter the electrophilicity of compounds, with a classic example being the [[Luche reduction]]. The large size of the ions coupled with their labile ionic bonding allows even bulky coordinating species to bind and dissociate rapidly, resulting in very high turnover rates; thus excellent yields can often be achieved with loadings of only a few mol%.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aspinall|first=Helen C.|title=Chemistry of the f-block elements|year=2001|publisher=Gordon & Breach|location=Amsterdam [u.a.]|isbn=978-9056993337}}</ref> The lack of orbital interactions combined with the lanthanide contraction means that the lanthanides change in size across the series but that their chemistry remains much the same.

The formation of trihydride is associated with and increase in 8\u201310% volume and this is linked to greater localization of charge on the hydrogen atoms which become more anionic (H<sup>\u2212</sup> hydride anion) in character.<ref name=\"Fukai\"/>\n\n====Halides====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align: center;\"\n|+ Lanthanide halides<ref name = \"Greenwood&Earnshaw\"/><ref name = \"Atwood\">{{cite book|title=The Rare Earth Elements: Fundamentals and Applications (eBook)|editor=David A.

The conducting forms can be considered as Ln<sup>III</sup> electride compounds where the electron is delocalised into a conduction band, Ln<sup>3+</sup> (X<sup>\u2212</sup>)<sub>2</sub>(e<sup>\u2212</sup>). All of the diodides have relatively short metal-metal separations.<ref name = \"Atwood\"/> The CuTi<sub>2</sub> structure of the lanthanum, cerium and praseodymium diodides along with HP-NdI<sub>2</sub> contain 4<sup>4</sup> nets of metal and iodine atoms with short metal-metal bonds (393-386 La-Pr).<ref name = \"Atwood\"/> these compounds should be considered to be two-dimensional metals (two-dimensional in the same way that graphite is). The salt-like dihalides include those of Eu, Dy, Tm, and Yb.

Scandium forms a similar cluster compound with chlorine, Sc<sub>7</sub>Cl<sub>12</sub><ref name = \"Greenwood&Earnshaw\"/> Unlike many transition metal clusters these lanthanide clusters do not have strong metal-metal interactions and this is due to the low number of valence electrons involved, but instead are stabilised by the surrounding halogen atoms.<ref name = \"Atwood\"/>\n\nLaI is the only known monohalide.

This divide is reflected in the first two \"rare earths\" that were discovered: [[Yttrium(III) oxide|yttria]] (1794) and [[Cerium(IV) oxide|ceria]] (1803). The geochemical divide has put more of the light lanthanides in the Earth's crust, but more of the heavy members in the Earth's mantle. The result is that although large rich ore-bodies are found that are enriched in the light lanthanides, correspondingly large ore-bodies for the heavy members are few. The principal ores are [[monazite]] and [[bastn\u00e4site]]. Monazite sands usually contain all the lanthanide elements, but the heavier elements are lacking in bastn\u00e4site.

[[Phosphor#Cathode ray tubes|Phosphors]] with lanthanide dopants are also widely used in [[cathode ray tube]] technology such as [[television]] sets. The earliest color television CRTs had a poor-quality red; europium as a phosphor dopant made good red phosphors possible. [[Yttrium iron garnet]] (YIG) spheres can act as tunable microwave resonators. Lanthanide oxides are mixed with [[tungsten]] to improve their high temperature properties for [[TIG welding]], replacing [[thorium]], which was mildly hazardous to work with. Many defense-related products also use lanthanide elements such as [[night vision goggle]]s and [[rangefinders]].

These are well-suited for this application due to their large [[Fluorescence|Stokes shifts]] and extremely long emission lifetimes (from [[microsecond]]s to [[millisecond]]s) compared to more traditional fluorophores (e.g., [[fluorescein]], [[allophycocyanin]], [[phycoerythrin]], and [[rhodamine]]). The biological fluids or serum commonly used in these research applications contain many compounds and proteins which are naturally fluorescent. Therefore, the use of conventional, steady-state fluorescence measurement presents serious limitations in assay sensitivity. Long-lived fluorophores, such as lanthanides, combined with time-resolved detection (a delay between excitation and emission detection) minimizes prompt fluorescence interference.\n\n[[Time-resolved spectroscopy|Time-resolved fluorometry (TRF)]] combined with [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)]] offers a powerful tool for drug discovery researchers: Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer or TR-FRET. TR-FRET combines the low background aspect of TRF with the homogeneous assay format of FRET. The resulting assay provides an increase in flexibility, reliability and sensitivity in addition to higher throughput and fewer false positive/false negative results.\n\nThis method involves two fluorophores: a donor and an acceptor. Excitation of the donor fluorophore (in this case, the lanthanide ion complex) by an energy source (e.g. flash lamp or laser) produces an energy transfer to the acceptor fluorophore if they are within a given proximity to each other (known as the [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|F\u00f6rster's radius]]). The acceptor fluorophore in turn emits light at its characteristic wavelength.\n\nThe two most commonly used lanthanides in life science assays are shown below along with their corresponding acceptor dye as well as their excitation and emission wavelengths and resultant [[Stokes shift]] (separation of excitation and emission wavelengths).\n{| class=\"wikitable\" |align=\"center\" |+ Life Science lanthanide Donor-Acceptor pairings\n!Donor\n!Excitation\u21d2Emission \u03bb (nm)\n!Acceptor\n!Excitation\u21d2Emission \u03bb (nm)\n!Stoke's Shift (nm)\n|-\n|Eu<sup>3+</sup>\n|340\u21d2615\n|[[Allophycocyanin]]\n|615\u21d2660\n|320\n|-\n|Tb<sup>3+</sup>\n|340\u21d2545\n|[[Phycoerythrin]]\n|545\u21d2575\n\n|235\n|}\n\n=== Possible medical uses ===\nCurrently there is research showing that lanthanide elements can be used as anticancer agents. The main role of the lanthanides in these studies is to inhibit proliferation of the cancer cells. Specifically cerium and lanthanum have been studied for their role as anti-cancer agents.\n\nOne of the specific elements from the lanthanide group that has been tested and used is cerium (Ce). There have been studies that use a protein-cerium complex to observe the effect of cerium on the cancer cells. The hope was to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cytotoxicity.<ref name=\"Palizban 119\u2013125\">{{Cite journal|title = Effect of cerium lanthanide on Hela and MCF-7 cancer cell growth in the presence of transferring|journal = Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences|date = 2010-01-01|pmc = 3093623|pmid = 21589800|pages = 119\u2013125|volume = 5|issue = 2|first = A.

Transferrin acts as a growth factor for the cancerous cells and is dependent on iron. Cancer cells have much higher levels of transferrin receptors than normal cells and are very dependent on iron for their proliferation.<ref name=\"Palizban 119\u2013125\"/> Cerium has shown results as an anti-cancer agent due to its similarities in structure and biochemistry to iron.  Cerium may bind in the place of iron on to the transferrin and then be brought into the cancer cells by transferrin-receptor mediated endocytosis.<ref name=\"Palizban 119\u2013125\"/> The cerium binding to the transferrin in place of the iron inhibits the transferrin activity in the cell. This creates a toxic environment for the cancer cells and causes a decrease in cell growth. This is the proposed mechanism for cerium's effect on cancer cells, though the real mechanism may be more complex in how cerium inhibits cancer cell proliferation. Specifically in [[HeLa]] cancer cells studied in vitro, cell viability was decreased after 48 to 72 hours of cerium treatments. Cells treated with just cerium had decreases in cell viability, but cells treated with both cerium and transferrin had more significant inhibition for cellular activity.<ref name=\"Palizban 119\u2013125\"/>\n\nAnother specific element that has been tested and used as an anti-cancer agent is lanthanum, more specifically lanthanum chloride (LaCl<sub>3</sub>). The lanthanum ion is used to affect the levels of let-7a and microRNAs miR-34a in a cell throughout the cell cycle.  When the lanthanum ion was introduced to the cell in vivo or in vitro, it inhibited the rapid growth and induced apoptosis of the cancer cells (specifically cervical cancer cells). This effect was caused by the regulation of the let-7a and microRNAs by the lanthanum ions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Lingfang|last2=Xiong|first2=Jieqi|last3=Guo|first3=Ling|last4=Miao|first4=Lifang|last5=Liu|first5=Sisun|last6=Guo|first6=Fei|year=2015|title=The effects of lanthanum chloride on proliferation and apoptosis of cervical cancer cells: involvement of let-7a and miR-34a microRNAs|url=|journal=BioMetals|volume=28|issue=5|pages=879\u2013890|doi=10.1007/s10534-015-9872-6|pmid=26209160}}<!--|access-date = 2015--></ref> The mechanism for this effect is still unclear but it is possible that the lanthanum is acting in a similar way as the cerium and binding to a ligand necessary for cancer cell proliferation.\n\n==Biological effects==\n\nDue to their sparse distribution in the earth's crust and low aqueous solubility, the lanthanides have a low availability in the biosphere, and for a long time were not known to naturally form part of any biological molecules.

All but one of the lanthanides are [[f-block]] elements, corresponding to the filling of the 4f [[electron shell]]; depending on the source, either [[lanthanum]] or [[lutetium]] is considered a [[d-block]] element, but is included due to its chemical similarities with the other 14.<ref>[http://chemistry.tutorvista.com/inorganic-chemistry/f-block-elements.html F Block Elements, Oxidation States, Lanthanides and Actinides]. Chemistry.tutorvista.com. Retrieved on 2017-12-14.</ref> All lanthanide elements form trivalent cations, Ln<sup>3+</sup>, whose chemistry is largely determined by the [[ionic radius]], which [[lanthanide contraction|decreases steadily]] from lanthanum to lutetium.\n\nThey are called lanthanides because the elements in the series are chemically similar to [[lanthanum]]. Both [[lanthanum]] and [[lutetium]] have been labeled as [[group 3 element]]s, because they have a single [[valence electron]] in the 5d shell. However, both elements are often included in discussions of the chemistry of lanthanide elements. Lanthanum is the more often omitted of the two, because its placement as a group 3 element is somewhat more common in texts and for semantic reasons: since \"lanthanide\" means \"like lanthanum\", it has been argued that lanthanum cannot logically be a lanthanide, but IUPAC acknowledges its inclusion based on common usage.<ref name=Greenwood&Earnshaw/>\n\nIn presentations of the [[periodic table]], the lanthanides and the [[actinide]]s are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table,<ref name=\"Gray\" /> with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series (either [[lanthanum]] and [[actinium]], or [[lutetium]] and [[lawrencium]]) shown in a single cell of the main table, between [[barium]] and [[hafnium]], and [[radium]] and [[rutherfordium]], respectively. This convention is entirely a matter of [[aesthetics]] and formatting practicality; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places, as parts of the table's sixth and seventh rows (periods).\n\nThe 1985 [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] \u201cRed Book\u201d (p.&nbsp;45) recommends that ''\"lanthanoid\"'' is used rather than ''\"lanthanide\"''. The ending \u201c-ide\u201d normally indicates a negative ion. However, owing to wide current use, \u201clanthanide\u201d is still allowed.\n{{Periodic table (lanthanides)}}\n\n==Etymology==\nTogether with the two elements at the top of group 3, [[scandium]] and [[yttrium]], the [[trivial name]] \"[[rare earths]]\" is sometimes used to describe all the lanthanides; a definition of rare earths including the group 3, lanthanide, and [[actinide]] elements is also occasionally seen, and rarely Sc + Y + lanthanides + thorium.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The \"earth\" in the name \"rare earths\" arises from the minerals from which they were isolated, which were uncommon oxide-type minerals. However, the use of the name is deprecated by [[IUPAC]], as the elements are neither rare in abundance nor \"earths\" (an obsolete term for water-insoluble strongly basic [[oxide]]s of electropositive metals incapable of being smelted into metal using late 18th century technology). Group 2 is known as the [[alkaline earth]] elements for much the same reason.\n\nThe \"rare\" in the \"rare earths\" name has much more to do with the difficulty of separating out each of the individual lanthanide elements than scarcity of any of them. By way of the Greek \"dysprositos\" for \"hard to get at,\" element 66, [[dysprosium]] was similarly named; lanthanum itself is named after a word for \"hidden.\" The elements 57 (La) to 71 (Lu) are very similar chemically to one another and frequently occur together in nature, often anywhere from three to all 15 of the lanthanides (along with yttrium as a 16th) occur in minerals such as [[samarskite]], [[monazite]] and many others which can also contain the other two group 3 elements as well as thorium and occasionally other actinides as well.<ref name=\"autoRefA\">\"The Elements\", Theodore Gray, Black\u2212Dog & Leventhal, Chicago 2007: \"Lanthanum\" and \"Cerium\" entries Ch 57 & 58, pp 134-7</ref>  A majority of the rare earths were discovered at the same mine in [[Ytterby, Sweden]] and four of them are named (yttrium, ytterbium, erbium, terbium) after the city and a fifth *(holmium) after Stockholm; scandium is named after [[Scandinavia]], [[thulium]] after the old name [[Thule]], and the immediately-following group 4 element (number 72) [[hafnium]] is named for the Latin name of the city of [[Copenhagen]].<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\nSamarskite (a mineral which is the source of the name of the element [[samarium]]) and other similar minerals in particular also have these elements in association with the nearby metals [[tantalum]], [[niobium]], [[hafnium]], [[zirconium]], [[vanadium]], and [[titanium]], from [[Group 4 element|group 4]] and [[Group 5 element|group 5]] often in similar oxidation states. Monazite is a phosphate of numerous group 3 + lanthanide + actinide metals and mined especially for the thorium content and specific rare earths especially lanthanum, yttrium and cerium. Cerium and lanthanum as well as other members of the rare earth series are often produced as a metal called [[mischmetal]] containing a variable mixture of these elements with cerium and lanthanum predominating; it has direct uses such as lighter flints and other spark sources which do not require extensive purification of one of these metals.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />  There are also rare earth-bearing minerals based on group 2 elements such as yttrocalcite, [[yttrocerite]], yttrofluorite which vary in content of yttrium, cerium, and lanthanum in a particular as well as varying amounts of the others.<ref>Rocks & Minerals, A Guide To Field Identification, Sorrell, St Martin's Press 1972, 1995, pp 118 (Halides), 228 (Carbonates)</ref> Other lanthanide/rare earth minerals include [[bastn\u00e4site]], [[florencite]], chernovite, [[perovskite]], [[xenotime]], [[cerite]], [[gadolinite]], [[lanthanite]], [[fergusonite]], [[polycrase]], [[blomstrandine]], [[H\u00e5leniusite-(La)|h\u00e5leniusite]], miserite, [[loparite]], [[Lepersonnite-(Gd)|lepersonnite]], [[euxenite]], all of which have a range of relative element concentration and may have the symbol of a predominating one such as monazite-ce; group 3 elements do not occur as [[native element]] minerals in the fashion of gold, silver, tantalum and many others on earth but may in [[lunar regolith]].  Very rare cerium, lanthanum, and presumably other lanthanide/group 3 halides, [[feldspar]]s and [[garnets]] are also known to exist.<ref>Minearls of the World, Johnsen, 2000</ref>\n\nAll of this is the result of the order in which the electron shells of these elements are filled\u2014the outermost has the same configuration for all of them, and a deeper shell is progressively filled with electrons as the atomic number increases from 57 towards 71.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" /> For many years, mixtures of  more than one rare earth were considered to be single elements, such as [[neodymium]] and [[praseodymium]] being thought to be the single element didymium and so on.<ref>\"The Elements\", Theodore Gray, Black Dog & Leventhal, Chicago 2007: \"Neodymium\" and \"Praseodymium\" entries Ch 59 & 60, pp 138-43</ref>  Very small differences in solubility are used in solvent and ion-exchange purification methods for these elements which require a great deal of repeating to get a purified metal.  The refined metals and their compounds have subtle and stark differences amongst themselves in electronic, electrical, optical, and magnetic properties which account for their many niche uses.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\nBy way of examples of the term meaning the above considerations rather than their scarcity, [[cerium]] is the 26th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and more abundant than copper,<ref name=\"autoRefA\" /> [[neodymium]] is more abundant than [[gold]]; [[thulium]] (the second least common naturally occurring lanthanide) is more abundant than [[iodine]],<ref name=aspinall/> which is itself common enough for [[biology]] to have evolved critical usages thereof, and even the lone radioactive element in the series, [[promethium]], is more common than the two rarest naturally occurring elements, [[francium]] and [[astatine]], combined. Despite their abundance, even the technical term \"lanthanides\" could be interpreted to reflect a sense of elusiveness on the part of these elements, as it comes from the Greek \u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''lanthanein''), \"to lie hidden\". However, if not referring to their natural abundance, but rather to their property of \"hiding\" behind each other in minerals, this interpretation is in fact appropriate. The etymology of the term must be sought in the first discovery of [[lanthanum]], at that time a so-called new [[rare earth element]] \"lying hidden\" in a [[cerium]] mineral, and it is an irony that [[lanthanum]] was later identified as the first in an entire series of chemically similar elements and could give name to the whole series. The term \"lanthanide\" was introduced by [[Victor Goldschmidt]] in 1925.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed029p581.2|title=Letters|year=1952|last1=Hakala|first1=Reino W.|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=29|issue=11|page=581|bibcode = 1952JChEd..29..581H }}</ref>\n\n==Physical properties of the elements==\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n![[Chemical element]]!![[Lanthanum|La]]!![[Cerium|Ce]]!![[praseodymium|Pr]]!![[neodymium|Nd]]!![[promethium|Pm]]!![[samarium|Sm]]!![[europium|Eu]]!![[gadolinium|Gd]]!![[terbium|Tb]]!![[dysprosium|Dy]]!![[holmium|Ho]]!![[erbium|Er]]!![[thulium|Tm]]!![[ytterbium|Yb]]!![[lutetium|Lu]]\n|-\n| [[Atomic number]]\n|57||58||59||60||61||62||63||64||65||66||67||68||69||70||71\n|-\n|Image|| [[File:Lanthanum-2.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Cerium2.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Praseodymium.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Neodymium2.jpg|50px]]|| ||[[File:Samarium-2.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Europium.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Gadolinium-4.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Terbium-2.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Dy chips.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Holmium2.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Erbium-crop.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Thulium sublimed dendritic and 1cm3 cube.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Ytterbium-3.jpg|50px]]||[[File:Lutetium sublimed dendritic and 1cm3 cube.jpg|50px]]\n|-\n|Density (g/cm<sup>3</sup>)\n|6.162 ||6.770 ||6.77 ||7.01 ||7.26 ||7.52 ||5.244 ||7.90 ||8.23 ||8.540 ||8.79 ||9.066 ||9.32 ||6.90 ||9.841\n|-\n|Melting point (\u00b0C)\n|920 ||795 ||935 ||1024 ||1042 ||1072 ||826 ||1312 ||1356 ||1407 ||1461 ||1529 ||1545 ||824 ||1652\n|-\n|Boiling point (\u00b0C)\n|3464 ||3443 ||3520 ||3074 ||3000 ||1794 ||1529 ||3273 ||3230 ||2567 ||2720 ||2868 ||1950 ||1196 ||3402\n|-\n| Atomic [[electron configuration]]<br>(gas phase)*||'''5d<sup>1</sup>'''||4f<sup>1</sup>'''5d<sup>1</sup>'''||4f<sup>3</sup>|| 4f<sup>4</sup>|| 4f<sup>5</sup>||4f<sup>6</sup>|| 4f<sup>7</sup>|| 4f<sup>7</sup>'''5d<sup>1</sup>'''||4f<sup>9</sup>||4f<sup>10</sup>|| 4f<sup>11</sup>||4f<sup>12</sup>||4f<sup>13</sup>||4f<sup>14</sup>||4f<sup>14</sup>'''5d<sup>1</sup>'''\n|-\n| Atomic electron configuration<br>(solid phase)*||5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>1</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>2</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>3</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>4</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>5</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>7</sup>||4f<sup>7</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>8</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>9</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>10</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>11</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>12</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>||4f<sup>14</sup>||4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>\n|-\n|Metal lattice (RT)\n|dhcp ||fcc ||dhcp ||dhcp ||dhcp ||** ||bcc ||hcp ||hcp ||hcp ||hcp||hcp ||hcp ||fcc ||hcp\n|-\n|Metallic radius (pm)\n|  162 || 181.8  ||182.4  ||181.4  ||183.4   ||180.4  ||208.4  ||180.4  ||177.3  ||178.1  ||176.2  ||176.1  ||175.9 ||193.3  ||173.8\n|-\n|Resistivity at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u03bc\u03a9\u00b7cm)\n| 57\u201380<br>20&nbsp;\u00b0C  || 73  ||68   ||64  ||    || 88  ||90  ||134  || 114  ||57  ||87  ||87  ||79  ||29  ||79\n|-\n|[[Magnetic susceptibility]]<br>\u03c7<sub>mol</sub> /10<sup>\u22126</sup>([[cubic centimeter|cm<sup>3</sup>]]\u00b7[[Mole (unit)|mol]]<sup>\u22121</sup>)\n||+95.9 ||+2500 (\u03b2)||+5530(\u03b1)||+5930 (\u03b1)|| ||+1278(\u03b1)||+30900||+185000<br>(350 K)||+170000 (\u03b1)||+98000||+72900||+48000||+24700||+67 (\u03b2)||+183\n|}\n</center>\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Between initial [[Xenon|Xe]] and final 6s<sup>2</sup> electronic shells\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Sm has a close packed structure like the other lanthanides but has an unusual 9 layer repeat\n\nGschneider and Daane (1988) attribute the trend in melting point which increases across the series, ([[lanthanum]] (920&nbsp;\u00b0C) \u2013 lutetium (1622&nbsp;\u00b0C)) to the extent of hybridization of the 6s, 5d, and 4f orbitals.

It is believed that the metal contains the larger Eu<sup>2+</sup> ion and that there are only two electrons in the conduction band. Ytterbium also has a large metallic radius, and a similar explanation is suggested.<ref name = \"Greenwood&Earnshaw\"/>\nThe [[resistivity|resistivities]] of the lanthanide metals are relatively high, ranging from 29 to 134 \u03bc\u03a9\u00b7cm.

However, transition metals are able to use [[vibronic coupling]] to break this rule. The valence orbitals in lanthanides are almost entirely non-bonding and as such little effective vibronic coupling takes, hence the spectra from f \u2192 f transitions are much weaker and narrower than those from d \u2192 d transitions. In general this makes the colors of lanthanide complexes far fainter than those of transition metal complexes. f \u2192 f transitions are not possible for the f<sup>1</sup> and f<sup>13</sup> configurations of Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Yb<sup>3+</sup> and thus these ions are colorless in aqueous solution.<ref>{{Ullmann|volume=31|page=191|last1=McGill|first1=Ian|contribution=Rare Earth Elements|doi=10.1002/14356007.a22_607}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Approximate colors of lanthanide ions in aqueous solution<ref name = \"Greenwood&Earnshaw\"/><ref name=\"HOWI1\">[[#Holleman|Holleman]], p.&nbsp;1937.</ref><ref name=\"dtv1\">dtv-Atlas zur Chemie '''1981''', Vol. 1, p.&nbsp;220.</ref>\n| style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Oxidation state\n| 57 || 58 || 59 || 60 || 61 || 62 || 63 || 64 || 65 || 66 || 67 || 68 || 69 || 70 || 71\n|-\n| +2|| || || || ||\n| style=\"background:#d00;\"| <span style=\"color:white\">'''Sm<sup>2+</sup>'''</span> || '''Eu<sup>2+</sup>'''\n|| || || || ||\n| style=\"background:#d07;\"| <span style=\"color:white\">'''Tm<sup>2+</sup>'''</span>\n| style=\"background:#cf0;\"| '''Yb<sup>2+</sup>''' ||\n|-\n| +3|| '''La<sup>3+</sup>''' || '''Ce<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#cf0;\"| '''Pr<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#b0d;\"| <span style=\"color:white\">'''Nd<sup>3+</sup>'''</span>\n| style=\"background:#d0d;\"| <span style=\"color:white\">'''Pm<sup>3+</sup>'''</span>\n| style=\"background:#fe0;\"| '''Sm<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| '''Eu<sup>3+</sup>''' || '''Gd<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#fee;\"| '''Tb<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#cf0;\"| '''Dy<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#ff0;\"| '''Ho<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#e0d;\"| <span style=\"color:white\">'''Er<sup>3+</sup>'''</span>\n| style=\"background:#ef0;\"| '''Tm<sup>3+</sup>'''\n| '''Yb<sup>3+</sup>''' || '''Lu<sup>3+</sup>'''\n|-\n| +4|| || style=\"background:#fd0;\"| '''Ce<sup>4+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#ff0;\"| '''Pr<sup>4+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#70d;\"| <span style=\"color:white\">'''Nd<sup>4+</sup>'''</span> || || || ||\n| style=\"background:#d60;\"| '''Tb<sup>4+</sup>'''\n| style=\"background:#fd0;\"| '''Dy<sup>4+</sup>''' || || || || ||\n|}</center>\n\n===Effect of 4f orbitals===\nGoing across the lanthanides in the periodic table, the 4f orbitals are usually being filled. The effect of the 4f orbitals on the chemistry of the lanthanides is profound and is the factor that distinguishes them from the [[transition metal]]s. There are seven 4f orbitals, and there are two different ways in which they are depicted: as a \"cubic set\" or as a general set. The [[atomic orbitals|cubic set]] is ''f''<sub>''z<sup>3</sup>''</sub>,  ''f''<sub>''xz<sup>2</sup>''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''yz<sup>2</sup>''</sub>,  ''f''<sub>''xyz''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''z(x<sup>2</sup>\u2212y<sup>2</sup>)''</sub>,  ''f''<sub>''x(x<sup>2</sup>\u22123y<sup>2</sup>)''</sub> and ''f''<sub>''y(3x<sup>2</sup>\u2212y<sup>2</sup>)''</sub>. The 4f orbitals penetrate the [Xe] core and are isolated, and thus they do not participate in bonding. This explains why crystal field effects are small and why they do not form \u03c0 bonds.<ref name=CottonSA2006/> As there are seven 4f orbitals, the number of unpaired electrons can be as high as 7, which gives rise to the large [[magnetochemistry|magnetic moments]] observed for lanthanide compounds. Measuring the magnetic moment can be used to investigate the 4f electron configuration, and this is a useful tool in providing an insight into the chemical bonding.<ref name=\"BochkarevFedushkin1997\">{{cite journal|last1=Bochkarev|first1=Mikhail N.|last2=Fedushkin|first2=Igor L.|last3=Fagin|first3=Anatoly A.|last4=Petrovskaya|first4=Tatyana V.|last5=Ziller|first5=Joseph W.|last6=Broomhall-Dillard|first6=Randy N.

This correlates with the highly reactive nature of the lanthanides.\n\nThe sum of the first two ionization energies for europium, 1632 kJ\u00b7mol<sup>\u22121</sup> can be compared with that of barium 1468.1 kJ\u00b7mol<sup>\u22121</sup> and europium's third ionization energy is the highest of the lanthanides. The sum of the first two ionization energies for ytterbium are the second lowest in the series and its third ionization energy is the second highest. The high third ionization energy for Eu and Yb correlate with the half filling 4f<sup>7</sup> and complete filling 4f<sup>14</sup> of the 4f subshell, and the stability afforded by such configurations due to exchange energy.<ref name=CottonSA2006/> Europium and ytterbium form salt like compounds with Eu<sup>2+</sup> and Yb<sup>2+</sup>, for example the salt like dihydrides.<ref name=\"Fukai\"/> Both europium and ytterbium dissolve in liquid ammonia forming solutions of Ln<sup>2+</sup>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x</sub> again demonstrating their similarities to the alkaline earth metals.<ref name = \"Greenwood&Earnshaw\"/>\n\nThe relative ease with which the 4th electron can be removed in cerium and (to a lesser extent praseodymium) indicates why Ce(IV) and Pr(IV) compounds can be formed, for example CeO<sub>2</sub> is formed rather than Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> when cerium reacts with oxygen.\n\n===Separation of lanthanides===\nThe similarity in ionic radius between adjacent lanthanide elements makes it difficult to separate them from each other in naturally occurring ores and other mixtures. Historically, the very laborious processes of [[Cascade (chemical engineering)|cascading]] and [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallization]] were used. Because the lanthanide ions have slightly different radii, the [[lattice energy]] of their salts and hydration energies of the ions will be slightly different, leading to a small difference in [[solubility]]. Salts of the formula Ln(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>\u00b72NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>\u00b74H<sub>2</sub>O can be used. Industrially, the elements are separated from each other by [[solvent extraction]]. Typically an aqueous solution of nitrates is extracted into kerosene containing [[Tributyl phosphate|tri-''n''-butylphosphate]].

Thus lanthanide [[coordination complex|complexes]] typically have little or no [[covalent bond|covalent]] character and are not influenced by orbital geometries. The lack of orbital interaction also means that varying the metal typically has little effect on the complex (other than size), especially when compared to [[transition metals]]. Complexes are held together by weaker [[ionic bond|electrostatic]] forces which are omni-directional and thus the ligands alone dictate the [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] and coordination of complexes. [[Steric effects|Steric factors]] therefore dominate, with coordinative saturation of the metal being balanced against inter-ligand repulsion. This results in a diverse range of [[Coordination geometry|coordination geometries]], many of which are irregular,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dehnicke|first=Kurt|last2==Greiner|first2=Andreas|title=Unusual Complex Chemistry of Rare-Earth Elements: Large Ionic Radii\u2014Small Coordination Numbers|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|year=2003|volume=42|issue=12|pages=1340\u20131354|doi=10.1002/anie.200390346|pmid=12671966}}</ref> and also manifests itself in the highly [[fluxional]] nature of the complexes. As there is no energetic reason to be locked into a single geometry, rapid intramolecular and intermolecular ligand exchange will take place. This typically results in complexes that rapidly fluctuate between all possible configurations.\n\nMany of these features make lanthanide complexes effective [[catalyst]]s. Hard Lewis acids are able to polarise bonds upon coordination and thus alter the electrophilicity of compounds, with a classic example being the [[Luche reduction]]. The large size of the ions coupled with their labile ionic bonding allows even bulky coordinating species to bind and dissociate rapidly, resulting in very high turnover rates; thus excellent yields can often be achieved with loadings of only a few mol%.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aspinall|first=Helen C.|title=Chemistry of the f-block elements|year=2001|publisher=Gordon & Breach|location=Amsterdam [u.a.]|isbn=978-9056993337}}</ref> The lack of orbital interactions combined with the lanthanide contraction means that the lanthanides change in size across the series but that their chemistry remains much the same.

This divide is reflected in the first two \"rare earths\" that were discovered: [[Yttrium(III) oxide|yttria]] (1794) and [[Cerium(IV) oxide|ceria]] (1803). The geochemical divide has put more of the light lanthanides in the Earth's crust, but more of the heavy members in the Earth's mantle. The result is that although large rich ore-bodies are found that are enriched in the light lanthanides, correspondingly large ore-bodies for the heavy members are few. The principal ores are [[monazite]] and [[bastn\u00e4site]]. Monazite sands usually contain all the lanthanide elements, but the heavier elements are lacking in bastn\u00e4site. The lanthanides obey the [[Oddo-Harkins rule]] \u2013 odd-numbered elements are less abundant than their even-numbered neighbors.\n\nThree of the lanthanide elements have radioactive isotopes with long half-lives (<sup>138</sup>La, <sup>147</sup>Sm and <sup>176</sup>Lu) that can be used to date minerals and rocks from Earth, the Moon and meteorites.<ref>There exist other naturally occurred radioactive isotopes of lanthanides with long half-lives (<sup>144</sup>Nd, <sup>150</sup>Nd, <sup>148</sup>Sm, <sup>151</sup>Eu, <sup>152</sup>Gd) but they are not used as chronometers.</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Industrial===\nLanthanide elements and their compounds have many uses but the quantities consumed are relatively small in comparison to other elements.

These are well-suited for this application due to their large [[Fluorescence|Stokes shifts]] and extremely long emission lifetimes (from [[microsecond]]s to [[millisecond]]s) compared to more traditional fluorophores (e.g., [[fluorescein]], [[allophycocyanin]], [[phycoerythrin]], and [[rhodamine]]). The biological fluids or serum commonly used in these research applications contain many compounds and proteins which are naturally fluorescent. Therefore, the use of conventional, steady-state fluorescence measurement presents serious limitations in assay sensitivity. Long-lived fluorophores, such as lanthanides, combined with time-resolved detection (a delay between excitation and emission detection) minimizes prompt fluorescence interference.\n\n[[Time-resolved spectroscopy|Time-resolved fluorometry (TRF)]] combined with [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)]] offers a powerful tool for drug discovery researchers: Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer or TR-FRET. TR-FRET combines the low background aspect of TRF with the homogeneous assay format of FRET. The resulting assay provides an increase in flexibility, reliability and sensitivity in addition to higher throughput and fewer false positive/false negative results.\n\nThis method involves two fluorophores: a donor and an acceptor. Excitation of the donor fluorophore (in this case, the lanthanide ion complex) by an energy source (e.g. flash lamp or laser) produces an energy transfer to the acceptor fluorophore if they are within a given proximity to each other (known as the [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|F\u00f6rster's radius]]). The acceptor fluorophore in turn emits light at its characteristic wavelength.\n\nThe two most commonly used lanthanides in life science assays are shown below along with their corresponding acceptor dye as well as their excitation and emission wavelengths and resultant [[Stokes shift]] (separation of excitation and emission wavelengths).\n{| class=\"wikitable\" |align=\"center\" |+ Life Science lanthanide Donor-Acceptor pairings\n!Donor\n!Excitation\u21d2Emission \u03bb (nm)\n!Acceptor\n!Excitation\u21d2Emission \u03bb (nm)\n!Stoke's Shift (nm)\n|-\n|Eu<sup>3+</sup>\n|340\u21d2615\n|[[Allophycocyanin]]\n|615\u21d2660\n|320\n|-\n|Tb<sup>3+</sup>\n|340\u21d2545\n|[[Phycoerythrin]]\n|545\u21d2575\n\n|235\n|}\n\n=== Possible medical uses ===\nCurrently there is research showing that lanthanide elements can be used as anticancer agents. The main role of the lanthanides in these studies is to inhibit proliferation of the cancer cells. Specifically cerium and lanthanum have been studied for their role as anti-cancer agents.\n\nOne of the specific elements from the lanthanide group that has been tested and used is cerium (Ce). There have been studies that use a protein-cerium complex to observe the effect of cerium on the cancer cells. The hope was to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cytotoxicity.<ref name=\"Palizban 119\u2013125\">{{Cite journal|title = Effect of cerium lanthanide on Hela and MCF-7 cancer cell growth in the presence of transferring|journal = Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences|date = 2010-01-01|pmc = 3093623|pmid = 21589800|pages = 119\u2013125|volume = 5|issue = 2|first = A.

Transferrin acts as a growth factor for the cancerous cells and is dependent on iron. Cancer cells have much higher levels of transferrin receptors than normal cells and are very dependent on iron for their proliferation.<ref name=\"Palizban 119\u2013125\"/> Cerium has shown results as an anti-cancer agent due to its similarities in structure and biochemistry to iron.  Cerium may bind in the place of iron on to the transferrin and then be brought into the cancer cells by transferrin-receptor mediated endocytosis.<ref name=\"Palizban 119\u2013125\"/> The cerium binding to the transferrin in place of the iron inhibits the transferrin activity in the cell. This creates a toxic environment for the cancer cells and causes a decrease in cell growth. This is the proposed mechanism for cerium's effect on cancer cells, though the real mechanism may be more complex in how cerium inhibits cancer cell proliferation. Specifically in [[HeLa]] cancer cells studied in vitro, cell viability was decreased after 48 to 72 hours of cerium treatments. Cells treated with just cerium had decreases in cell viability, but cells treated with both cerium and transferrin had more significant inhibition for cellular activity.<ref name=\"Palizban 119\u2013125\"/>\n\nAnother specific element that has been tested and used as an anti-cancer agent is lanthanum, more specifically lanthanum chloride (LaCl<sub>3</sub>). The lanthanum ion is used to affect the levels of let-7a and microRNAs miR-34a in a cell throughout the cell cycle.  When the lanthanum ion was introduced to the cell in vivo or in vitro, it inhibited the rapid growth and induced apoptosis of the cancer cells (specifically cervical cancer cells). This effect was caused by the regulation of the let-7a and microRNAs by the lanthanum ions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Lingfang|last2=Xiong|first2=Jieqi|last3=Guo|first3=Ling|last4=Miao|first4=Lifang|last5=Liu|first5=Sisun|last6=Guo|first6=Fei|year=2015|title=The effects of lanthanum chloride on proliferation and apoptosis of cervical cancer cells: involvement of let-7a and miR-34a microRNAs|url=|journal=BioMetals|volume=28|issue=5|pages=879\u2013890|doi=10.1007/s10534-015-9872-6|pmid=26209160}}<!--|access-date = 2015--></ref> The mechanism for this effect is still unclear but it is possible that the lanthanum is acting in a similar way as the cerium and binding to a ligand necessary for cancer cell proliferation.\n\n==Biological effects==\n\nDue to their sparse distribution in the earth's crust and low aqueous solubility, the lanthanides have a low availability in the biosphere, and for a long time were not known to naturally form part of any biological molecules. In 2007 a novel [[methanol dehydrogenase]] that strictly uses lanthanides as enzymatic [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] was discovered in a bacterium from the phylum [[Verrucomicrobia]], ''[[Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum]]''. This bacterium was found to survive only if there are lanthanides present in the environment.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=((Pol, A., et al)) | title = Rare Earth Metals Are Essential for Methanotrophic Life in Volcanic Mudpots. | journal = Environ Microbiol | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 255\u2013264 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24034209| doi = 10.1111/1462-2920.12249}}</ref> Compared to most other [[dietary mineral|nondietary elements]], non-radioactive lanthanides are classified as having low toxicity.<ref name=Ullmann>McGill, Ian (2005) \"Rare Earth Elements\" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a22_607}}.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Actinide}}\n* {{annotated link|Group 3 element}}\n* {{annotated link|Lanthanide contraction}}\n* {{annotated link|Rare-earth element}}\n* {{annotated link|Lanthanide probes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Cited sources==\n* {{Cite book|ref=Holleman|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2007|edition=102|isbn=978-3-11-017770-1|title=Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first=Arnold F.|last=Holleman|author2=Wiberg, Egon |author3=Wiberg, Nils |language=German}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20181014043641/http://www.sparkle.pro.br/ lanthanide Sparkle Model], used in the computational chemistry of lanthanide complexes\n* [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/rare_earths/ USGS Rare Earths Statistics and Information]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080415085514/http://www.chem.unr.edu/faculty/abd/ Ana de Bettencourt-Dias: Chemistry of the lanthanides and lanthanide-containing materials]\n* Eric Scerri, 2007, ''The periodic table: Its story and its significance,'' Oxford University Press, New York, {{ISBN|9780195305739}}\n\n{{Compact periodic table}}\n{{Navbox periodic table}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Periodic table]]\n[[Category:Lanthanides| ]]\n", "name_user": "Dgope", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanthanide"}
