It features eleven newly recorded tracks, along with a [[remix]] of their 1986 smash hit \"[[Venus (Shocking Blue song)|Venus]]\" (done by [[Soft Cell]]'s [[Marc Almond]]) and a 2005 remix of their 1982 hit \"[[Really Saying Something]]\", an underground [[white label|bootleg]] club hit produced by Solasso.\n\n''Drama'' is a comeback of sorts for Bananarama members [[Keren Woodward]] and [[Sara Dallin]] and is their first album to be released in their native UK since 1993. The album's first single \"[[Move in My Direction]]\" debuted on the [[UK Singles Chart]] at Number 14, also becoming their first UK Top 40 hit since 1993. The second single, \"[[Look on the Floor (Hypnotic Tango)]]\", also hit the UK Top 40, and climbed to Number 2 on the US [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart as an import, becoming Bananarama's biggest US dancefloor hit since \"Venus\" two decades earlier.\n\nThe album mostly incorporates [[Dance-pop|pop]] and [[eurodance]] musical styles, with some [[synthpop]] elements. ''Drama'' charted at a number 169 in the UK. It was later released in the United States (both in retail stores and as [[Music download|digital download]]s) in 2006. While the album performed well on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s [[Top Electronic Albums]] chart, peaking at number 21, it did not chart on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the US Pop Albums chart.\n\n==Track listing==\n'''Original Edition'''\n# \"[[Move in My Direction]]\" \u2013 3:20 <small>(S.

From 1901 onwards, for the purposes of the [[Census of India prior to independence|Decennial Census]], the British classified all J\u0101tis into one or the other of the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'' categories as described in ancient texts. Herbert Hope Risley, the Census Commissioner, noted that \"The principle suggested as a basis was that of classification by social precedence as recognized by native public opinion at the present day, and manifesting itself in the facts that particular castes are supposed to be the modern representatives of one or other of the castes of the theoretical Indian system.\"<ref>Crooke, William. \"Social Types\". Chapter II in Risley, Sir Herbert Hope. The People of India</ref> The system of ''Varnas'' propounded in ancient Hindu texts envisages the society divided into four classes: [[Brahmin]]s (scholars and yajna priests), [[Kshatriya]]s (rulers and warriors), [[Vaishyas]] (farmers, merchants and artisans) and [[Shudras]] (workmen/service providers). The texts do not mention any separate, untouchable category in ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'' classification. Scholars believe that the ''Varnas'' system was never truly operational in society and there is no evidence of it ever being a reality in Indian history. The practical division of the society had always been in terms of ''J\u0101tis'' (birth groups), which are not based on any specific principle, but could vary from ethnic origins to occupations to geographic areas. The ''J\u0101tis'' have been endogamous groups without any fixed hierarchy but subject to vague notions of rank articulated over time based on lifestyle and social, political or economic status.

Nevertheless, the caste system still exists in [[endogamy]] and [[Family patrimony|patrimony]], and thrives in the politics of democracy, where caste provides ready made constituencies to politicians. The globalization and economic opportunities from foreign businesses has influenced the growth of India's middle-class population. Some members of the Chhattisgarh Potter Caste Community (CPCC) are middle-class urban professionals and no longer potters unlike the remaining majority of traditional rural potter members. There is persistence of caste in Indian politics. Caste associations have evolved into caste-based political parties. Political parties and the state perceive caste as an important factor for mobilization of people and policy development.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sen|first1=Ronojoy.|title=The persistence of caste in indian politics|journal=Pacific Affairs|date=2012|volume=85|issue=2|pages=363\u2013369|doi=10.5509/2012852363}}</ref>\n\nStudies by Bhatt and Beteille have shown changes in status, openness, mobility in the social aspects of Indian society. As a result of the modern social pressures on the country, India is experiencing a change in their social sphere dynamic as well as economically in the caste system.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gandhi|first1=Rag S.|title=FROM CASTE TO CLASS IN INDIAN SOCIETY|journal=Humboldt Journal of Social Relations|date=1980|volume=7|issue=2|pages=1\u201314}}</ref> While arranged marriages are still the most common practice in India, the internet has provided a network for younger Indians to take control of their relationships through the use of dating apps.

Men are expected to marry within their caste, or one below, with no social repercussions. If a woman marries into a higher caste, then her children will take the status of their father. If she marries down, her family is reduced to the social status of their son in law. In this case, the women are bearers of the egalitarian principle of the marriage. There would be no benefit in marrying a higher caste if the terms of the marriage did not imply equality.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Kingsley Davis | date=13 June 2013 | title=Intermarriage in Caste Societies | journal=[[AnthroSource]] | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=376\u2013395 | doi=10.1525/aa.1941.43.3.02a00030 }}</ref> However, men are systematically shielded from the negative implications of the agreement.\n\nGeographical factors also determine adherence to the caste system. Many Northern villages are more likely to participate in exogamous marriage, due to a lack of eligible suitors within the same caste. Women in North India have been found to be less likely to leave or divorce their husbands since they are of a relatively lower caste system, and have higher restrictions on their freedoms. On the other hand, Pahari women, of the northern mountains, have much more freedom to leave their husbands without stigma. This often leads to better husbandry as his actions are not protected by social expectations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Berreman|first1=Gerald D.|title=Village Exogamy in Northernmost India|date=1962|volume=18|issue=1|pages=55\u201358}}</ref>\n\nChiefly among the factors influencing the rise of exogamy is the rapid [[urbanisation in India]] experienced over the last century. It is well known that urban centers tend to be less reliant on tradition and are more progressive as a whole. As India\u2019s cities boomed in population, the job market grew to keep pace. Prosperity and stability were now more easily attained by an individual, and the anxiety to marry quickly and effectively was reduced as traditional marriage was viewed as a means to attain these principles. Thus, younger, more progressive generations of urban Indians are less likely than ever to participate in the antiquated system of arranged endogamy.\n\nIndia has also experimented with Affirmative Action, locally known as \u201creservation groups\u201d. Quota system jobs, as well as placements in publicly funded colleges, hold spots for the 8% of India\u2019s minority, and underprivileged groups. As a result, in states such as Tamil Nadu or those in the north-east, where underprivileged populations predominate, over 80% of government jobs are set aside in quotas. In education, colleges lower the marks necessary for the Dalits to enter.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Delhi A.R | date=13 June 2013 | title=Indian Reservations | url=https://www.economist.com/banyan/2013/06/29/indian-reservations | journal=[[The Economist]] | access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Seventy-two Specimens of Castes in India (62).jpg|thumb|A page from the manuscript ''Seventy-two Specimens of Castes in India'', which consists of 72 full-color hand-painted images of men and women of various religions, occupations and ethnic groups found in [[Madurai|Madura, India]] in 1837, which confirms the popular perception and nature of caste as Jati, before the British made it applicable only to Hindus grouped under the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'' categories from the 1901 census onwards.]]\n\n==Caste systems in the rest of South Asia==\n===Nepal===\n{{Main|Caste system in Nepal}}\nThe [[Nepal]]ese caste system resembles in some respects the Indian ''j\u0101ti'' system, with numerous ''j\u0101ti'' divisions with a ''varna'' system superimposed.

Examples include the [[Mangyan people|Mangyan]] and the [[Kalanguya people]]s.<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/>\n* Warrior societies - societies where a distinct warrior class exists, and whose membership depends on martial prowess. Examples include the [[Mandaya people|Mandaya]], [[Bagobo people|Bagobo]], [[Tagakaulo people|Tagakaulo]], and [[B'laan people]]s who had warriors called the ''bagani'' or ''magani''. Similarly, in the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera highlands]] of [[Luzon]], the [[Isneg people|Isneg]] and [[Kalinga people]]s refer to their warriors as ''mengal'' or ''maingal''. This society is typical for [[head-hunting]] ethnic groups or ethnic groups which had seasonal raids (''[[mangayaw]]'') into enemy territory.<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/>\n* Petty [[Plutocracy|plutocracies]] - societies which have a wealthy class based on property and the hosting of periodic prestige feasts. In some groups, it was an actual caste whose members had specialized leadership roles, married only within the same caste, and wore specialized clothing. These include the ''kadangyan'' of the [[Ifugao people|Ifugao]], [[Bontoc people|Bontoc]], and [[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]] peoples, as well as the ''baknang'' of the [[Ibaloi people]]. In others, though wealth may give one prestige and leadership qualifications, it was not a caste per se.<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/>\n*Principalities - societies with an actual ruling class and caste systems determined by birthright. Most of these societies are either [[Greater India|Indianized]] or [[Islamized]] to a degree. They include the larger coastal ethnic groups like the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]], [[Visayan people|Visayan]], and [[Moro people|Moro]] societies. Most of them were usually divided into four to five caste systems with different names under different ethnic groups that roughly correspond to each other. The system was more or less [[feudalistic]], with the ''datu'' ultimately having control of all the lands of the community. The land is subdivided among the enfranchised classes, the ''sakop'' or ''sa-op'' ([[vassal]]s, lit. \"those under the power of another\"). The castes were hereditary, though they were not rigid. They were more accurately a reflection of the interpersonal political relationships, a person is always the follower of another. People can move up the caste system by marriage, by wealth, or by doing something extraordinary; and conversely they can be demoted, usually as criminal punishment or as a result of debt. Shamans are the exception, as they are either volunteers, chosen by the ranking shamans, or born into the role by innate propensity for it.

They are often further categorized according to purity of lineage. The power of the ''datu'' is dependent on the willingness of their followers to render him respect and obedience. Most roles of the datu were judicial and military. In case of an unfit ''datu'', support may be withdrawn by his followers. ''Datu'' were almost always male, though in some ethnic groups like the [[Banwaon people]], the female shaman (''[[babaylan|babaiyon]]'') co-rules as the female counterpart of the ''datu''.\n:* Nobility - (Visayan: ''[[tumao]]''; [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]: ''[[maginoo]]''; [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] ''ginu''; [[Tausug people|Tausug]]: ''bangsa mataas'') the ruling class, either inclusive of or exclusive of the royal family. Most are descendants of the royal line or gained their status through wealth or bravery in battle. They owned lands and subjects, from whom they collected taxes.\n:* Shamans - (Visayan: ''[[babaylan]]''; Tagalog: ''[[katalonan]]'') the spirit mediums, usually female or feminized men. While they weren't technically a caste, they commanded the same respect and status as nobility.\n:* Warriors - (Visayan: ''[[timawa]]''; Tagalog: ''[[maharlika]]'') the martial class.

At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles ([[kuge]]), together with the Sh\u014dgun and daimy\u014d. Below them, the population was divided into [[Four occupations|four classes]]: [[samurai]], peasants, craftsmen and merchants. Only samurai were allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasants, craftsman or merchant who he felt were disrespectful. Merchants were the lowest caste because they did not produce any products. The castes were further sub-divided; for example, peasants were labelled as ''furiuri'', ''tanagari'', ''mizunomi-byakusho'' among others. As in Europe, the castes and sub-classes were of the same race, religion and culture.\n\nHowell, in his review of [[Japan]]ese society notes that if a Western power had colonized Japan in the 19th century, they would have discovered and imposed a rigid four-caste hierarchy in Japan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Geographies of identity in nineteenth-century Japan|author=David L.

The meaning today is that of butcher. It originates in the [[Goryeo-Khitan Wars|Khitan invasion of Korea]] in the 11th century. The defeated [[Khitans]] who surrendered were settled in isolated communities throughout Goryeo to forestall rebellion.  They were valued for their skills in hunting, herding, butchering, and making of leather, common skill sets among nomads.  Over time, their ethnic origin was forgotten, and they formed the bottom layer of Korean society.\n\nIn 1392, with the foundation of the Confucian [[Joseon dynasty]], Korea systemised its own native class system. At the top were the two official classes, the [[Yangban]], which literally means \"two classes\". It was composed of scholars (''munban'') and warriors (''muban''). Scholars had a significant social advantage over the warriors. Below were the ''jung-in'' (\uc911\uc778-\u4e2d\u4eba: literally \"middle people\". This was a small class of specialized professions such as medicine, accounting, translators, regional bureaucrats, etc. Below that were the ''sangmin'' (\uc0c1\ubbfc-\u5e38\u6c11: literally 'commoner'), farmers working their own fields.

Following the collapse of the [[Enlightenment Party|Gabo government]], the new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One measure was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal [[social equality]], which was implemented by the loyalists' cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.<ref name=\"proper\">Hwang, Kyung Moon (2004), University of Southern California.

According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters' surname, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term ''inmin'' (\"people\") and later, ''kungmin'' (\"citizen\").<ref name=\"proper\"/>\n\n====North Korea====\n{{Main|Songbun}}\n\nThe [[Committee for Human Rights in North Korea]] reported that \"Every North Korean citizen is assigned a heredity-based class and socio-political rank over which the individual exercises no control but which determines all aspects of his or her life.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=06 Jun 2012 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9313174/North-Korea-caste-system-underpins-human-rights-abuses.html |title=North Korea caste system 'underpins human rights abuses' |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref> Called ''[[Songbun]]'', [[Barbara Demick]] describes this \"class structure\" as an updating of the hereditary \"caste system\", a combination of [[Confucianism]] and [[Stalinism]].<ref>Barbara Demick, ''Nothing to Envy: Love, Life and Death in North Korea'', Fourth Estate, London, 2010, pp. 26\u201327.</ref> She claims that a bad family background is called \"tainted blood\", and that by law this \"tainted blood\" lasts three generations.<ref>Demick, pp. 28, 197, 202.</ref>\n\n===West Asia===\n{{further|Yazidi}}\n\n[[Yezidi]] society is hierarchical.

These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in [[Ivory Coast]], with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Further considerations of caste in West Africa: The Senufo|author=Dolores Richter|journal=Africa|date= January 1980|volume=50|issue=1|pages=37\u201354|doi=10.2307/1158641|jstor=1158641}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mand\u00e9]] societies in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]] have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the ''jonow'' slaves as inferior. Similarly, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the ''geer'' (freeborn/nobles), ''jaam'' (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass ''neeno''. In various parts of West Africa, [[Fula people|Fulani]] societies also have class divisions. Other castes include ''Griots'', ''Forgerons'', and ''Cordonniers''.\n\nTamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the ''Malinke'' people no later than 14th century, and was present among the ''Wolof'' and ''Soninke'', as well as some ''Songhay'' and ''Fulani'' populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the ''Sosso-Malinke'' war described in the ''Sunjata'' epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.\n\nAs West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.<ref name=tamari1>{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1991|volume=32|issue=2|pages=221\u2013250|doi=10.1017/S0021853700025718|title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa|author=Tal Tamari}}</ref>\n\n====Central Africa====\n{{Expand section|date=February 2019}}\n\nEthel M.

From 1901 onwards, for the purposes of the [[Census of India prior to independence|Decennial Census]], the British classified all J\u0101tis into one or the other of the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'' categories as described in ancient texts. Herbert Hope Risley, the Census Commissioner, noted that \"The principle suggested as a basis was that of classification by social precedence as recognized by native public opinion at the present day, and manifesting itself in the facts that particular castes are supposed to be the modern representatives of one or other of the castes of the theoretical Indian system.\"<ref>Crooke, William. \"Social Types\". Chapter II in Risley, Sir Herbert Hope. The People of India</ref> The system of ''Varnas'' propounded in ancient Hindu texts envisages the society divided into four classes: [[Brahmin]]s (scholars and yajna priests), [[Kshatriya]]s (rulers and warriors), [[Vaishyas]] (farmers, merchants and artisans) and [[Shudras]] (workmen/service providers). The texts do not mention any separate, untouchable category in ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'' classification. Scholars believe that the ''Varnas'' system was never truly operational in society and there is no evidence of it ever being a reality in Indian history. The practical division of the society had always been in terms of ''J\u0101tis'' (birth groups), which are not based on any specific principle, but could vary from ethnic origins to occupations to geographic areas. The ''J\u0101tis'' have been endogamous groups without any fixed hierarchy but subject to vague notions of rank articulated over time based on lifestyle and social, political or economic status.

Nevertheless, the caste system still exists in [[endogamy]] and [[Family patrimony|patrimony]], and thrives in the politics of democracy, where caste provides ready made constituencies to politicians. The globalization and economic opportunities from foreign businesses has influenced the growth of India's middle-class population. Some members of the Chhattisgarh Potter Caste Community (CPCC) are middle-class urban professionals and no longer potters unlike the remaining majority of traditional rural potter members. There is persistence of caste in Indian politics. Caste associations have evolved into caste-based political parties. Political parties and the state perceive caste as an important factor for mobilization of people and policy development.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sen|first1=Ronojoy.|title=The persistence of caste in indian politics|journal=Pacific Affairs|date=2012|volume=85|issue=2|pages=363\u2013369|doi=10.5509/2012852363}}</ref>\n\nStudies by Bhatt and Beteille have shown changes in status, openness, mobility in the social aspects of Indian society. As a result of the modern social pressures on the country, India is experiencing a change in their social sphere dynamic as well as economically in the caste system.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gandhi|first1=Rag S.|title=FROM CASTE TO CLASS IN INDIAN SOCIETY|journal=Humboldt Journal of Social Relations|date=1980|volume=7|issue=2|pages=1\u201314}}</ref> While arranged marriages are still the most common practice in India, the internet has provided a network for younger Indians to take control of their relationships through the use of dating apps.

Men are expected to marry within their caste, or one below, with no social repercussions. If a woman marries into a higher caste, then her children will take the status of their father. If she marries down, her family is reduced to the social status of their son in law. In this case, the women are bearers of the egalitarian principle of the marriage. There would be no benefit in marrying a higher caste if the terms of the marriage did not imply equality.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Kingsley Davis | date=13 June 2013 | title=Intermarriage in Caste Societies | journal=[[AnthroSource]] | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=376\u2013395 | doi=10.1525/aa.1941.43.3.02a00030 }}</ref> However, men are systematically shielded from the negative implications of the agreement.\n\nGeographical factors also determine adherence to the caste system. Many Northern villages are more likely to participate in exogamous marriage, due to a lack of eligible suitors within the same caste. Women in North India have been found to be less likely to leave or divorce their husbands since they are of a relatively lower caste system, and have higher restrictions on their freedoms. On the other hand, Pahari women, of the northern mountains, have much more freedom to leave their husbands without stigma. This often leads to better husbandry as his actions are not protected by social expectations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Berreman|first1=Gerald D.|title=Village Exogamy in Northernmost India|date=1962|volume=18|issue=1|pages=55\u201358}}</ref>\n\nChiefly among the factors influencing the rise of exogamy is the rapid [[urbanisation in India]] experienced over the last century. It is well known that urban centers tend to be less reliant on tradition and are more progressive as a whole. As India\u2019s cities boomed in population, the job market grew to keep pace. Prosperity and stability were now more easily attained by an individual, and the anxiety to marry quickly and effectively was reduced as traditional marriage was viewed as a means to attain these principles. Thus, younger, more progressive generations of urban Indians are less likely than ever to participate in the antiquated system of arranged endogamy.\n\nIndia has also experimented with Affirmative Action, locally known as \u201creservation groups\u201d. Quota system jobs, as well as placements in publicly funded colleges, hold spots for the 8% of India\u2019s minority, and underprivileged groups. As a result, in states such as Tamil Nadu or those in the north-east, where underprivileged populations predominate, over 80% of government jobs are set aside in quotas. In education, colleges lower the marks necessary for the Dalits to enter.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Delhi A.R | date=13 June 2013 | title=Indian Reservations | url=https://www.economist.com/banyan/2013/06/29/indian-reservations | journal=[[The Economist]] | access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Seventy-two Specimens of Castes in India (62).jpg|thumb|A page from the manuscript ''Seventy-two Specimens of Castes in India'', which consists of 72 full-color hand-painted images of men and women of various religions, occupations and ethnic groups found in [[Madurai|Madura, India]] in 1837, which confirms the popular perception and nature of caste as Jati, before the British made it applicable only to Hindus grouped under the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'' categories from the 1901 census onwards.]]\n\n==Caste systems in the rest of South Asia==\n===Nepal===\n{{Main|Caste system in Nepal}}\nThe [[Nepal]]ese caste system resembles in some respects the Indian ''j\u0101ti'' system, with numerous ''j\u0101ti'' divisions with a ''varna'' system superimposed.

A similar exercise was made during the reign of Mahindra Malla (1506\u20131575).

The Siwa caste was subdivided into five: Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher-caste Brahmana men with lower-caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by these 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to ''castas'' in Spanish colonies such as Mexico, and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.<ref name=boon/>\n\n====Philippines====\n[[File:Naturales 3.png|thumb|A [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] royal couple (''[[maginoo]]''), from the [[Boxer Codex]] (c. 1590)]]\nIn the Philippines, pre-colonial societies do not have a single social structure. The class structures can be roughly categorized into four types:<ref name=\"Scott1979\">{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=William Henry |title=Class Structure in the Unhispanized Philippines |journal=Philippine Studies |date=1979 |volume=27 |issue=2, Special Issue in Memory of Frank Lynch |pages=137\u2013159 |jstor=42632474 }}</ref>\n* Classless societies - egalitarian societies with no class structure. Examples include the [[Mangyan people|Mangyan]] and the [[Kalanguya people]]s.<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/>\n* Warrior societies - societies where a distinct warrior class exists, and whose membership depends on martial prowess. Examples include the [[Mandaya people|Mandaya]], [[Bagobo people|Bagobo]], [[Tagakaulo people|Tagakaulo]], and [[B'laan people]]s who had warriors called the ''bagani'' or ''magani''. Similarly, in the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera highlands]] of [[Luzon]], the [[Isneg people|Isneg]] and [[Kalinga people]]s refer to their warriors as ''mengal'' or ''maingal''. This society is typical for [[head-hunting]] ethnic groups or ethnic groups which had seasonal raids (''[[mangayaw]]'') into enemy territory.<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/>\n* Petty [[Plutocracy|plutocracies]] - societies which have a wealthy class based on property and the hosting of periodic prestige feasts. In some groups, it was an actual caste whose members had specialized leadership roles, married only within the same caste, and wore specialized clothing. These include the ''kadangyan'' of the [[Ifugao people|Ifugao]], [[Bontoc people|Bontoc]], and [[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]] peoples, as well as the ''baknang'' of the [[Ibaloi people]]. In others, though wealth may give one prestige and leadership qualifications, it was not a caste per se.<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/>\n*Principalities - societies with an actual ruling class and caste systems determined by birthright. Most of these societies are either [[Greater India|Indianized]] or [[Islamized]] to a degree. They include the larger coastal ethnic groups like the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]], [[Visayan people|Visayan]], and [[Moro people|Moro]] societies. Most of them were usually divided into four to five caste systems with different names under different ethnic groups that roughly correspond to each other. The system was more or less [[feudalistic]], with the ''datu'' ultimately having control of all the lands of the community. The land is subdivided among the enfranchised classes, the ''sakop'' or ''sa-op'' ([[vassal]]s, lit. \"those under the power of another\"). The castes were hereditary, though they were not rigid. They were more accurately a reflection of the interpersonal political relationships, a person is always the follower of another. People can move up the caste system by marriage, by wealth, or by doing something extraordinary; and conversely they can be demoted, usually as criminal punishment or as a result of debt. Shamans are the exception, as they are either volunteers, chosen by the ranking shamans, or born into the role by innate propensity for it. They are enumerated below from the highest rank to the lowest:<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/><ref name=\"arcilla\">{{cite book|author=Arcilla, Jos\u00e9 S. |title =An Introduction to Philippine History|publisher =Ateneo de Manila University Press|year =1998|page=14&ndash;16|isbn =9789715502610|url =https://books.google.com/?id=uxEYobbU-D8C&lpg=PA15&dq=timawa&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q=timawa&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"scott2\">{{cite book|author=Scott, William Henry |title =Barangay: sixteenth-century Philippine culture and society|publisher =Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=9789715501354|year =1994}}</ref>\n:* Royalty - ([[Visayan people|Visayan]]: ''[[kadatoan]]'') the ''[[datu]]'' and immediate descendants. They are often further categorized according to purity of lineage. The power of the ''datu'' is dependent on the willingness of their followers to render him respect and obedience. Most roles of the datu were judicial and military. In case of an unfit ''datu'', support may be withdrawn by his followers. ''Datu'' were almost always male, though in some ethnic groups like the [[Banwaon people]], the female shaman (''[[babaylan|babaiyon]]'') co-rules as the female counterpart of the ''datu''.\n:* Nobility - (Visayan: ''[[tumao]]''; [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]: ''[[maginoo]]''; [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] ''ginu''; [[Tausug people|Tausug]]: ''bangsa mataas'') the ruling class, either inclusive of or exclusive of the royal family. Most are descendants of the royal line or gained their status through wealth or bravery in battle. They owned lands and subjects, from whom they collected taxes.\n:* Shamans - (Visayan: ''[[babaylan]]''; Tagalog: ''[[katalonan]]'') the spirit mediums, usually female or feminized men. While they weren't technically a caste, they commanded the same respect and status as nobility.\n:* Warriors - (Visayan: ''[[timawa]]''; Tagalog: ''[[maharlika]]'') the martial class. They could own land and subjects like the higher ranks, but were required to fight for the ''datu'' in times of war. In some Filipino ethnic groups, they were often tattooed extensively to record feats in battle and as protection against harm. They were sometimes further subdivided into different classes, depending on their relationship with the ''datu''. They traditionally went on seasonal raids on enemy settlements.\n:* Commoners and slaves - (Visayan, [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]]: ''[[ulipon]]''; Tagalog: ''[[alipin]]''; Tausug: ''kiapangdilihan''; [[Maranao people|Maranao]]: ''kakatamokan'') - the lowest class composed of the rest of the community who were not part of the enfranchised classes. They were further subdivided into the commoner class who had their own houses, the servants who lived in the houses of others, and the slaves who were usually captives from raids, criminals, or debtors. Most members of this class were equivalent to the European [[serf]] class, who paid taxes and can be conscripted to communal tasks, but were more or less free to do as they please.\n\n===East Asia===\n\n====China and Mongolia====\n\nDuring the period of [[Yuan Dynasty]], ruler [[Kublai Khan]] enforced a ''Four Class System'', which was a legal caste system.

Below them, the population was divided into [[Four occupations|four classes]]: [[samurai]], peasants, craftsmen and merchants. Only samurai were allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasants, craftsman or merchant who he felt were disrespectful. Merchants were the lowest caste because they did not produce any products. The castes were further sub-divided; for example, peasants were labelled as ''furiuri'', ''tanagari'', ''mizunomi-byakusho'' among others. As in Europe, the castes and sub-classes were of the same race, religion and culture.\n\nHowell, in his review of [[Japan]]ese society notes that if a Western power had colonized Japan in the 19th century, they would have discovered and imposed a rigid four-caste hierarchy in Japan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Geographies of identity in nineteenth-century Japan|author=David L.

Following the collapse of the [[Enlightenment Party|Gabo government]], the new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One measure was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal [[social equality]], which was implemented by the loyalists' cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.<ref name=\"proper\">Hwang, Kyung Moon (2004), University of Southern California.

According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters' surname, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area.

These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in [[Ivory Coast]], with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Further considerations of caste in West Africa: The Senufo|author=Dolores Richter|journal=Africa|date= January 1980|volume=50|issue=1|pages=37\u201354|doi=10.2307/1158641|jstor=1158641}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mand\u00e9]] societies in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]] have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the ''jonow'' slaves as inferior. Similarly, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the ''geer'' (freeborn/nobles), ''jaam'' (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass ''neeno''. In various parts of West Africa, [[Fula people|Fulani]] societies also have class divisions. Other castes include ''Griots'', ''Forgerons'', and ''Cordonniers''.\n\nTamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the ''Malinke'' people no later than 14th century, and was present among the ''Wolof'' and ''Soninke'', as well as some ''Songhay'' and ''Fulani'' populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the ''Sosso-Malinke'' war described in the ''Sunjata'' epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.\n\nAs West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.<ref name=tamari1>{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1991|volume=32|issue=2|pages=221\u2013250|doi=10.1017/S0021853700025718|title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa|author=Tal Tamari}}</ref>\n\n====Central Africa====\n{{Expand section|date=February 2019}}\n\nEthel M.

He then presents the Dime of Southwestern Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited.<ref>{{cite journal|title=La Caste en Afrique? (Caste in Africa?)|author=D. M.

In 2012, planning permission was submitted in order to build a 7.5km bypass which will route traffic to the east of the city. All permissions were granted subsequently by February 2016, and work commenced in May 2016. A number of setbacks have occurred, especially after the loss of [[Carillion]] as the main contractor, after they entered liquidation in January 2018. [[Galliford Try]] were chosen as the replacement contractor. As of March 2020, three roundabouts have opened and a substantial amount of the works have been completed.

Unlike other major British tabloids such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', the ''Mirror'' has no separate Scottish edition; this function is performed by the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' and ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'', which incorporate certain stories from the ''Mirror'' that are of Scottish significance.\n\nOriginally pitched to the middle-class reader, it was converted into a working-class newspaper after 1934, in order to reach a larger audience. The ''Mirror'' has had a number of owners. It was founded by [[Alfred Harmsworth]], who sold it to his brother [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Harold Harmsworth]] (from 1914 Lord Rothermere) in 1913. In 1963 a restructuring of the media interests of the Harmsworth family led to the ''Mirror'' becoming a part of [[IPC Media#International Publishing Corporation|International Publishing Corporation]]. During the mid 1960s, daily sales exceeded 5 million copies, a feat never repeated by it or any other daily (non-Sunday) British newspaper since.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928073311/http://www.mmc.gov.uk/rep_pub/reports/1985/fulltext/190c02.pdf United Newspapers PLC and Fleet Holdings PLC]'', [[Monopolies and Mergers Commission]] (1985), pp.5&ndash;16</ref> The ''Mirror'' was owned by [[Robert Maxwell]] between 1984 and 1991.

The album was produced mostly by [[Dr. Dre]] and Eminem, along with [[The 45 King]], the [[Bass Brothers]], and [[Melvin \"Mel-Man\" Bradford|Mel-Man]]. It was recorded over a two-month period in several studios in the Detroit area, and during this time, Eminem felt significant pressure to improve upon the success of his previous record. \n\nReleased a year after Eminem's breakout album ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'', the album features more introspective lyricism including his response to his sudden rise to fame and controversy surrounding his lyrics. Musically, the album incorporates [[horrorcore]] and [[hardcore hip hop]]. Like its predecessor, ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' was surrounded by significant controversy upon its release. Criticism centered around lyrics that were considered violent, homophobic, and misogynistic. [[Lynne Cheney]] criticized the lyrics at a [[United States Senate]] hearing, while the [[Canadian government]] considered refusing Eminem's entry into the country. \n\n''The Marshall Mathers LP'' debuted at number one on the [[US Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 1.78 million copies in its first week alone which made it one of the [[Lists of fastest-selling albums|fastest-selling studio albums]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/photos/426851/albums-that-sold-1-million-in-one-week|title=Albums That Sold 1 Million in One Week|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> The album's first single \"[[The Real Slim Shady]]\" became Eminem's biggest hit up to that point, and gained notoriety for poking fun at [[pop culture]] figures at the time such as [[NSYNC]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Will Smith]].<ref name=\"Ellis256\" /> The album also features \"[[Stan (song)|Stan]]\", which has been regarded as one of Eminem's [[signature song]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.liveabout.com/top-eminem-songs-p2-2858002|title=The 15 Best Eminem Songs Have a Stirring Blend of Rhyme and Music|last=since 2005|first=Henry Adaso Henry Adaso has written about hip-hop|last2=for \"Vibe|first2=founded the award-winning blog The Rap Up He has written|website=LiveAbout|language=en|access-date=2019-12-28|last3=Mtv|first3=\"|last4=Rehab|first4=Rap|last5=more.}}</ref> Despite the controversy of the album, it received acclaim from critics, who praised Eminem's lyrical ability and emotional depth.\n\nOne of the most ground breaking and controversial albums in [[American music]], ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' has been named on several lists of the greatest albums of all time and is widely regarded as Eminem's best album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/eminem-admits-hes-still-looking-to-eclipse-the-marshall-mathers-lp-news.72817.html|title=Eminem Admits He's Still Looking To Eclipse \"The Marshall Mathers LP\"|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> It has sold 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], and was certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

''[[The Marshall Mathers LP 2]]'', the [[sequel]] to the album, was released in 2013.\n\n== Background ==\nInspired by the disappointment of his debut album, ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'' (1996), [[Eminem]] created the [[alter ego]] Slim Shady, whom he introduced on the ''[[Slim Shady EP]]'' (1997).<ref name=\"BlowsUp\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminem-blows-up-20091105|title=Eminem Blows Up|last=Bozza|first=Anthony|authorlink = Anthony Bozza|date=November 5, 2009|accessdate=February 16, 2012|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> After placing second in the annual [[Rap Olympics]], Eminem was noticed by the staff at [[Interscope Records]] and eventually CEO [[Jimmy Iovine]], who played the ''Slim Shady EP'' for well-known hip hop producer [[Dr. Dre]].<ref name=\"BlowsUp\" /> Eminem and Dr. Dre then met and became fast friends, recording ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'' (1999), which was noted for its over-the-top lyrical depictions of drugs and violence.<ref name=\"BlowsUp\" /> ''The Slim Shady LP'' was a critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and selling 283,000 copies in its first week.<ref name=\"Charts?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452682/got-charts-o-brother-sales-boost-likely.jhtml|title=Got Charts?

The rapper, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter Hailie, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle.<ref name=\"Hasted 123\">Hasted, 2011. p. 123</ref> In June 1999, he married his girlfriend Kimberly Ann \"Kim\" Scott, the mother of Hailie, despite the fact that the song \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" from ''The Slim Shady LP'' contains references to killing her.<ref name=\"finalsplit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,619299,00.html|title=Eminem, Kim: Final Split|work=People|publisher=Time, Inc.|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.}}</ref> The rapper became uncomfortable with the level of fame he had achieved, and said, \"I don't trust nobody now because everybody I meet is meeting me as Eminem...I don't know if they are hanging with me 'cause they like me or because I'm a celebrity or because they think they can get something from me.\"<ref name=\"Hasted 123\"/> Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as \"misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence\", and in an editorial, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' editor in chief [[Timothy White (editor)|Timothy White]] accused Eminem of \"making money by exploiting the world's misery\".<ref name=\"BlowsUp\" />\n\n== Recording ==\n[[File:Eminem-01-mika.jpg|thumb|left|Eminem (pictured in 1999) wrote the majority of ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' while in the studio.]]\n''The Marshall Mathers LP'' was recorded in a two-month-long \"creative binge\", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions.<ref name=\"Hasted 153\">Hasted, 2011. p. 153</ref> Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording in order to stay focused on working and figuring out how to \"map out\" each song.<ref name=\"Hasted 153\" /> He described himself as a \"studio rat\" who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio.<ref name=\"Hasted 156\">Hasted, 2011. p. 156</ref> Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, \"We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio.' We just wait and see what happens when we get there.\"<ref name=\"Drdrevh1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/ultimate_albums/marshall/interview_dre.jhtml|title=Ultimate Albums: The Marshall Mathers LP \u2013 Dr. Dre interview|work=[[VH1]]|accessdate=July 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030901065534/http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/ultimate_albums/marshall/interview_dre.jhtml|archive-date=September 1, 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref> Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from \"fucking around\" in the studio; \"Marshall Mathers\" developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while \"Criminal\" was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door.<ref name=\"Hasted 156\" /> \"Kill You\" was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.<ref name=\"Drdrevh1\" />\n\n\"Kim\" was the first song the rapper recorded for the album, shortly after finishing work on ''The Slim Shady LP'' in late 1998.<ref name=\"hasted120\">Hasted, p. 120</ref> Eminem wrote \"Kim\" at a time in which he and his wife were separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater.<ref name=\"hasted120\" /> Originally intending to write a love song for her while using [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate.<ref name=\"Vanhoozer84\">Vanhoozer, p. 84</ref> With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, \"I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'.\"<ref name=\"hasted121\">Hasted, p. 121</ref> The song \"[[Stan (song)|Stan]]\" was produced by [[The 45 King]]. Eminem's manager, [[Paul Rosenberg (music manager)|Paul Rosenberg]], sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter [[Dido (singer)|Dido]]'s \"[[Thank You (Dido song)|Thank You]]\".<ref name=\"Eminemvh1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/ultimate_albums/marshall/interview_eminem.jhtml|title=Ultimate Albums: The Marshall Mathers LP \u2013 Eminem interview|work=[[VH1]]|accessdate=July 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031230030718/http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/ultimate_albums/marshall/interview_eminem.jhtml|archive-date=December 30, 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref> Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for \"Stan\" differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: {{\"'}}Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about.\"<ref name=\"Eminemvh1\" /> Dido later heard \"Stan\" and enjoyed it, and observed, \"I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it.' When they sent ['Stan'] to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow!

These expectations placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, \"I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect.\"<ref name=\"Eminemvh1\" /> After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single.<ref name=\"Eminemvh1\" /> Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote \"The Way I Am\" as his way of saying, \"Look, this is the best I can do. I can't give you another 'My Name Is.' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen.\"<ref name=\"Eminemvh1\" /> However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became \"The Real Slim Shady\".<ref name=\"Eminemvh1\" /> The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer stated, \"It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better.

The album was produced mostly by [[Dr. Dre]] and Eminem, along with [[The 45 King]], the [[Bass Brothers]], and [[Melvin \"Mel-Man\" Bradford|Mel-Man]]. It was recorded over a two-month period in several studios in the Detroit area, and during this time, Eminem felt significant pressure to improve upon the success of his previous record. \n\nReleased a year after Eminem's breakout album ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'', the album features more introspective lyricism including his response to his sudden rise to fame and controversy surrounding his lyrics. Musically, the album incorporates [[horrorcore]] and [[hardcore hip hop]]. Like its predecessor, ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' was surrounded by significant controversy upon its release. Criticism centered around lyrics that were considered violent, homophobic, and misogynistic. [[Lynne Cheney]] criticized the lyrics at a [[United States Senate]] hearing, while the [[Canadian government]] considered refusing Eminem's entry into the country. \n\n''The Marshall Mathers LP'' debuted at number one on the [[US Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 1.78 million copies in its first week alone which made it one of the [[Lists of fastest-selling albums|fastest-selling studio albums]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/photos/426851/albums-that-sold-1-million-in-one-week|title=Albums That Sold 1 Million in One Week|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> The album's first single \"[[The Real Slim Shady]]\" became Eminem's biggest hit up to that point, and gained notoriety for poking fun at [[pop culture]] figures at the time such as [[NSYNC]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Will Smith]].<ref name=\"Ellis256\" /> The album also features \"[[Stan (song)|Stan]]\", which has been regarded as one of Eminem's [[signature song]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.liveabout.com/top-eminem-songs-p2-2858002|title=The 15 Best Eminem Songs Have a Stirring Blend of Rhyme and Music|last=since 2005|first=Henry Adaso Henry Adaso has written about hip-hop|last2=for \"Vibe|first2=founded the award-winning blog The Rap Up He has written|website=LiveAbout|language=en|access-date=2019-12-28|last3=Mtv|first3=\"|last4=Rehab|first4=Rap|last5=more.}}</ref> Despite the controversy of the album, it received acclaim from critics, who praised Eminem's lyrical ability and emotional depth.\n\nOne of the most ground breaking and controversial albums in [[American music]], ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' has been named on several lists of the greatest albums of all time and is widely regarded as Eminem's best album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/eminem-admits-hes-still-looking-to-eclipse-the-marshall-mathers-lp-news.72817.html|title=Eminem Admits He's Still Looking To Eclipse \"The Marshall Mathers LP\"|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> It has sold 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], and was certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

''[[The Marshall Mathers LP 2]]'', the [[sequel]] to the album, was released in 2013.\n\n== Background ==\nInspired by the disappointment of his debut album, ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'' (1996), [[Eminem]] created the [[alter ego]] Slim Shady, whom he introduced on the ''[[Slim Shady EP]]'' (1997).<ref name=\"BlowsUp\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminem-blows-up-20091105|title=Eminem Blows Up|last=Bozza|first=Anthony|authorlink = Anthony Bozza|date=November 5, 2009|accessdate=February 16, 2012|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> After placing second in the annual [[Rap Olympics]], Eminem was noticed by the staff at [[Interscope Records]] and eventually CEO [[Jimmy Iovine]], who played the ''Slim Shady EP'' for well-known hip hop producer [[Dr. Dre]].<ref name=\"BlowsUp\" /> Eminem and Dr. Dre then met and became fast friends, recording ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'' (1999), which was noted for its over-the-top lyrical depictions of drugs and violence.<ref name=\"BlowsUp\" /> ''The Slim Shady LP'' was a critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and selling 283,000 copies in its first week.<ref name=\"Charts?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452682/got-charts-o-brother-sales-boost-likely.jhtml|title=Got Charts?

The rapper, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter Hailie, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle.<ref name=\"Hasted 123\">Hasted, 2011. p. 123</ref> In June 1999, he married his girlfriend Kimberly Ann \"Kim\" Scott, the mother of Hailie, despite the fact that the song \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" from ''The Slim Shady LP'' contains references to killing her.<ref name=\"finalsplit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,619299,00.html|title=Eminem, Kim: Final Split|work=People|publisher=Time, Inc.|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.}}</ref> The rapper became uncomfortable with the level of fame he had achieved, and said, \"I don't trust nobody now because everybody I meet is meeting me as Eminem...I don't know if they are hanging with me 'cause they like me or because I'm a celebrity or because they think they can get something from me.\"<ref name=\"Hasted 123\"/> Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as \"misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence\", and in an editorial, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' editor in chief [[Timothy White (editor)|Timothy White]] accused Eminem of \"making money by exploiting the world's misery\".<ref name=\"BlowsUp\" />\n\n== Recording ==\n[[File:Eminem-01-mika.jpg|thumb|left|Eminem (pictured in 1999) wrote the majority of ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' while in the studio.]]\n''The Marshall Mathers LP'' was recorded in a two-month-long \"creative binge\", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions.<ref name=\"Hasted 153\">Hasted, 2011. p. 153</ref> Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording in order to stay focused on working and figuring out how to \"map out\" each song.<ref name=\"Hasted 153\" /> He described himself as a \"studio rat\" who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio.<ref name=\"Hasted 156\">Hasted, 2011. p. 156</ref> Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, \"We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio.' We just wait and see what happens when we get there.\"<ref name=\"Drdrevh1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/ultimate_albums/marshall/interview_dre.jhtml|title=Ultimate Albums: The Marshall Mathers LP \u2013 Dr. Dre interview|work=[[VH1]]|accessdate=July 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030901065534/http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/ultimate_albums/marshall/interview_dre.jhtml|archive-date=September 1, 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref> Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from \"fucking around\" in the studio; \"Marshall Mathers\" developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while \"Criminal\" was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door.<ref name=\"Hasted 156\" /> \"Kill You\" was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.<ref name=\"Drdrevh1\" />\n\n\"Kim\" was the first song the rapper recorded for the album, shortly after finishing work on ''The Slim Shady LP'' in late 1998.<ref name=\"hasted120\">Hasted, p. 120</ref> Eminem wrote \"Kim\" at a time in which he and his wife were separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater.<ref name=\"hasted120\" /> Originally intending to write a love song for her while using [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate.<ref name=\"Vanhoozer84\">Vanhoozer, p. 84</ref> With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, \"I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'.\"<ref name=\"hasted121\">Hasted, p. 121</ref> The song \"[[Stan (song)|Stan]]\" was produced by [[The 45 King]]. Eminem's manager, [[Paul Rosenberg (music manager)|Paul Rosenberg]], sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter [[Dido (singer)|Dido]]'s \"[[Thank You (Dido song)|Thank You]]\".<ref name=\"Eminemvh1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/ultimate_albums/marshall/interview_eminem.jhtml|title=Ultimate Albums: The Marshall Mathers LP \u2013 Eminem interview|work=[[VH1]]|accessdate=July 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031230030718/http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/ultimate_albums/marshall/interview_eminem.jhtml|archive-date=December 30, 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref> Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for \"Stan\" differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: {{\"'}}Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about.\"<ref name=\"Eminemvh1\" /> Dido later heard \"Stan\" and enjoyed it, and observed, \"I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it.' When they sent ['Stan'] to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow!

These expectations placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, \"I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect.\"<ref name=\"Eminemvh1\" /> After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single.<ref name=\"Eminemvh1\" /> Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote \"The Way I Am\" as his way of saying, \"Look, this is the best I can do. I can't give you another 'My Name Is.' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen.\"<ref name=\"Eminemvh1\" /> However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became \"The Real Slim Shady\".<ref name=\"Eminemvh1\" /> The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer stated, \"It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better.

The only outside producer on the album was The 45 King, who sampled a verse from Dido's song \"Thank You\" for \"Stan\", while adding a slow bass line.\n\n''The Marshall Mathers LP'' contains more autobiographical themes in comparison to ''The Slim Shady LP''.<ref name=\"Hilburn\">{{cite news|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Hilburn|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/20/entertainment/ca-31967|title=Eminem's Latest Seems Sure to Delight Fans, Anger Parents|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 20, 2000|accessdate=June 12, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812004414/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/20/entertainment/ca-31967|archivedate=August 12, 2013}}</ref> Much of the album is spent addressing his rise to fame and attacking those who criticized his previous album.

This movement shared its roots in the ongoing Tamil [[Bhakti movement]], particularly the Shaiva [[Nayanars]] traditions, over the 7th- to 11th-century. However, Basava championed devotional worship that rejected temple worship and rituals led by Brahmins and replaced it with personalized direct worship of Shiva through practices such as individually worn icons and symbols like a small [[linga]]. This approach brought Shiva's presence to everyone and at all times, without gender, class or caste discrimination.<ref name=\"janpeter4\">Jan Peter Schouten (1995), Revolution of the Mystics: On the Social Aspects of V\u012bra\u015baivism, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812383}}, page 4</ref><ref>R Blake Michael (1992), The Origins of V\u012bra\u015baiva Sects, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807761}}, pages 1\u20135</ref> Basava's poem, such as Basavanna 703, speak of strong sense of gender equality and community bond, willing to wage war for the right cause, yet being a fellow \"devotees' bride\" at the time of his or her need.<ref>AK Ramanujan (1973), Speaking of \u015aiva, Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|978-0140442700}}, page 29</ref>\n\nA recurring contrast in his poems and ideas is of ''Sthavara'' and ''Jangama'', that is, of \"what is static, standing\" and \"what is moving, seeking\" respectively.

This path offers nothing less than liberation in this lifetime.\"<ref name=raophiloso/>\n\n===Roots in the Vedanta philosophy===\nSripati, a Virasaiva scholar, explained Basava's philosophy in ''Srikara Bhasya'', using the [[Vedanta Sutra]], suggesting Basava's Lingayat theology to be a form of qualified nondualism, wherein the individual [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul) is the body of God, and that there is no difference between Shiva and Atman (self, soul), Shiva is one's Atman, one's Atman is Shiva.<ref name=olson244/> Sripati's analysis places Basava's views in [[Vedanta]] school, in a form closer to the 11th century [[Vishishtadvaita]] philosopher [[Ramanuja]], than to [[Advaita]] philosopher [[Adi Shankara]]. However, Sripati's analysis has been contested by other scholars.<ref name=olson244/>\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n[[File:Kudala Sangama.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kudala sangama]] in [[Bagalkot district]], where Basava's samadhi is located.]]\nThe Lingayats, also known as ''Virasaivas'' or ''Veerasaivas'', traditionally believe that Basava was the founder of their tradition.<ref name=carlolson/><ref>Velcheru Rao and Gene Roghair (2014), Siva's Warriors: The Basava Purana of Palkuriki Somanatha, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691604879}}, pages 3\u20135</ref> However, modern scholarship relying on historical evidence such as the Kalachuri inscriptions state that Basava was the 12th-century poet-philosopher who revived and energized an already existing tradition.<ref name=carlolson/><ref name=britannica/><ref name=edrice/> The community he helped form is also known as the ''Sharanas''. The community is largely concentrated in [[Karnataka]], but has migrated into other states of India as well as overseas. Towards the end of the 20th century, Michael estimates, one-sixth of the population of the state of Karnataka, or about 10 million people, were Lingayat Hindus, or of the tradition championed by Basava.<ref name=\"wisw\">R Blake Michael (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1462945 Work as Worship in V\u012bra\u015baiva Tradition], Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Vol. 50, No. 4, pages 605\u2013606</ref>\n\n===Social reform===\n[[File:Necklace with Shiva's Family LACMA M.85.140.jpg|thumb|A necklace with pendant containing linga symbol of Shiva are worn by devotees of the tradition championed by Basavanna. [[Rudraksha]] beads (shown above) and ''Vibhuti'' (sacred ash on forehead) are other reminders of one's principles of faith.<ref name=olson244/>]]\nBasava advocated that every human being was equal, irrespective of caste and that all forms of manual labor was equally important.<ref name=mnsrinivas/> Michael states that it wasn't birth but behavior that determined a true saint and Shaiva bhakta in the view of Basava and ''Sharanas'' community.<ref name=blake7/> This, writes Michael, was also the position of south Indian man,  that it was \"behavior, not birth\" that determines the true man.<ref name=\"blake7\">R Blake Michael (1992), The Origins of V\u012bra\u015baiva Sects, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807761}}, pages 7\u20139</ref> One difference between the two was that Sharanas welcomed anyone, whatever occupation he or she might have been born in, to convert and be reborn into the larger family of Shiva devotees and then adopt any occupation he or she wanted.<ref name=blake7/>\n\n===Synthesis of diverse Hindu traditions===\nBasavanna is credited with uniting diverse spiritual trends during his era. Jan Peter Schouten states that ''Virashaivism'', the movement championed by Basava, tends towards monotheism with Shiva as the godhead, but with a strong awareness of the unity of the [[Brahman|Ultimate Reality]].<ref name=\"janviramon\">Jan Peter Schouten (1995), Revolution of the Mystics: On the Social Aspects of V\u012bra\u015baivism, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812383}}, pages 9\u201310</ref> Schouten calls this as a synthesis of Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita and Shankara's Advaita traditions, naming it ''Shakti-Vishishtadvaita'', that is monism fused with Shakti beliefs.<ref name=janviramon/> An individual's spiritual progress is viewed by Basava's tradition as a six-stage ''Satsthalasiddhanta'', which progressively evolves the individual through phase of the devotee, to phase of the master, then phase of the receiver of grace, thereafter Linga in life-breath (god dwells in his or her soul), the phase of surrender (awareness of no distinction in god and soul, self), to the last stage of complete union of soul and god (liberation, [[moksha|mukti]]).<ref name=janviramon/> Basava's approach is different than [[Adi Shankara]], states Schouten, in that Basava emphasizes the path of devotion, compared to Shankara's emphasis on the path of knowledge \u2013 a system of monistic [[Advaita]] philosophy widely discussed in Karnataka in the time of Basava.<ref>Jan Peter Schouten (1995), Revolution of the Mystics: On the Social Aspects of V\u012bra\u015baivism, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812383}}, pages 111\u2013112</ref>\n\nJessica Frazier et al. state that Basava laid the foundations of a movement that united \"Vedic with Tantric practice, and Advaitic [[monism]] with effusive [[Bhakti movement|Bhakti devotionalism]].\"<ref>Jessica Frazier et al (2014), The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1472511515}}, page 281</ref>\n\n===Icons and symbols===\n[[File:Bronze bust of Basaveswara on Albert Embankment in London, facing Parliament.JPG|thumb|The bust of Basaveswara, unveiled in [[London]] in 2015, facing the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] ]]\nBasava advocated the wearing of ''Ishtalinga'', a necklace with [[pendant]] that contains a small Shiva linga.<ref name=\"mnsrinivas\">MN Srinivas (1980), The Remembered Village, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039483}}, pages 307\u2013308</ref> He was driven by his realization; in one of his Vachanas he says ''Arive Guru'', which means one's own awareness is his/her teacher.
