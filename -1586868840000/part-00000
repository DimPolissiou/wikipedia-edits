In that six-year spell, he won nine major honours with the club including domestic trebles in the 1998\u201399 and 2002\u201303 seasons, representing the side on more than 150 occasions in competitive football.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Italy===\nAmoruso began his career at local club, [[A.S.

In 1995, he secured a move to [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], becoming club [[Captain (association football)|captain]] and making 54 appearances. He won the [[Coppa Italia]] in 1996 and in 1997 the Florence side went on a remarkable run in Europe where they reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Cup Winners Cup]] only to lose out to eventual champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.serieaweekly.com/2012/01/player-profile-lorenzo-amoruso.html | title=Player Profile: Lorenzo Amoruso | accessdate=2 May 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522005321/http://www.serieaweekly.com/2012/01/player-profile-lorenzo-amoruso.html | archivedate=22 May 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Rangers===\nFollowing interest from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-231566/Everton-chasing-Souness.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Jeff | last=Powell | title=Everton chasing Souness | date=30 May 1997}}</ref> Amoruso signed for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] on 29 May 1997 for a fee of [[\u00a3]]4&nbsp;million.

In that six-year spell, he won nine major honours with the club including domestic trebles in the 1998\u201399 and 2002\u201303 seasons, representing the side on more than 150 occasions in competitive football.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Italy===\nAmoruso began his career at local club, [[A.S.

Amoruso spent 1991-1993 on loan at [[Mantova Calcio|Mantova]] and [[Pescara Calcio|Pescara]], but only featured intermittently. In 1995, he secured a move to [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], becoming club [[Captain (association football)|captain]] and making 54 appearances. He won the [[Coppa Italia]] in 1996 and in 1997 the Florence side went on a remarkable run in Europe where they reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Cup Winners Cup]] only to lose out to eventual champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.serieaweekly.com/2012/01/player-profile-lorenzo-amoruso.html | title=Player Profile: Lorenzo Amoruso | accessdate=2 May 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522005321/http://www.serieaweekly.com/2012/01/player-profile-lorenzo-amoruso.html | archivedate=22 May 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Rangers===\nFollowing interest from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-231566/Everton-chasing-Souness.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Jeff | last=Powell | title=Everton chasing Souness | date=30 May 1997}}</ref> Amoruso signed for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] on 29 May 1997 for a fee of [[\u00a3]]4&nbsp;million.
