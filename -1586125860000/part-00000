The ad is seen by Cherry, the daughter of American millionaire Cyrus B. Waters, and as she is keen on the idea of becoming a princess the necessary arrangements are made. Soon afterwards, however, Arlette, the maid of honour to the country's [[Queen dowager]], wanders by chance into the prince's private apartments where he is contemplating his financial difficulties. Arlette mistakes the prince for somebody else, and he, delighted by her naivety and charm, does not correct her. They discuss the many good attributes of the prince, and Paul gives her a private telephone number (\"The Telephone Song\"). Meanwhile, an armed revolution against Perania is being led by Kalitza, a woman who loves the prince's chief bodyguard, Rono. Rono (one of the army of four) is persuaded by Kalitza to assassinate the prince, but he bungles the attempt, angering Kalitza, and she decides to do the deed herself.<ref name=Bindon/>\n\nIn the evening a fancy dress ball is held at the casino during which it is discovered that the country's crown jewels have been stolen, but in reality they have been pawned by the Prince, who, caught by the comic gendarmes Anatole and Adh\u00e9mar in disguise at the ball, arrest him. They are disconcerted to discover that the supposed thief is actually their prince. Paul abdicates so that he can put all these troubles behind him and marry his sweetheart, Arlette. Kalitza, disarmed by his abdication, decides to spare his life. His cousin, the Duke of Aristo, takes the throne and marries Cherry: the kingdom's finances are restored, the revolutionaries are pleased, and Arlette and Paul live in peace and happiness.<ref name=Bindon>Findon, B.

After a period as an instructor at [[RAF Calshot]], he left the service in 1935 (retaining a reserve commission) to join [[Imperial Airways]]. Over the next five years, Bennett specialised in long-distance flights, breaking a number of records and pioneering techniques which would later become commonplace, notably [[aerial refueling|air-to-air refuelling]]. In 1936 he wrote the first edition of his ''The complete air navigator: covering the syllabus for the flight navigator's licence'' (Pitman, London) which he updated several times up to the seventh edition in 1967. In July 1938 he piloted the ''Mercury'' part of the [[Short Mayo Composite]] flying-boat across the Atlantic; this flight earned him the [[Oswald Watt Gold Medal]] for that year.\n\n==Second World War==\nDuring 1940 Bennett's long-distance expertise was set to work setting up the [[Atlantic Ferry Organization]] tasked with the wartime delivery of thousands of aircraft manufactured in the United States and Canada to the United Kingdom. At that time, a transatlantic flight was a significant event, but the Atlantic Ferry project proved remarkably successful and demonstrated that with suitable training even inexperienced pilots could safely deliver new aircraft across the North Atlantic.\n\nBennett was recommissioned in 1941 in the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] as a squadron leader. His first task was to oversee the formation of the Elementary Air Navigation School, Eastbourne, for the initial training of observers (later navigators). However he was promoted to [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]], and appointed to the command of [[No. 77 Squadron RAF|No. 77 Squadron]], based at [[RAF Leeming]] and flying [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley|Whitleys]] in 4 Group, Bomber Command, on 7 December 1941.\n\nIn April 1942, No. 77 Squadron was transferred to [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]] and Bennett was given command of [[No. 10 Squadron RAF|No. 10 Squadron]] ([[Handley Page Halifax]]) and shortly afterwards led a raid on the [[German battleship Tirpitz|German battleship ''Tirpitz'']]. Shot down during that raid, he evaded capture and escaped to Sweden, from where he was able to return to Britain; he and his copilot were awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) on 16&nbsp;June 1942.<ref>''London Gazette'' 12 June 1942 Issue number: 35597 page 2649</ref>\n\n===Pathfinder Force===\nIn July 1942, Bennett was appointed to command the new [[Pathfinder Force]], an elite unit tasked with improving [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s navigation. At this stage of the war, Bomber Command had begun to make night-time raids deep into Germany, but had not yet been able to cause significant damage, largely because only about a quarter of the bomb loads were delivered \"on target\" \u2014 and this at a time when \"on target\" was defined as within three miles of the aim point.\n\nPathfinder Force was set up to lead the [[bomber stream]] to the target areas and drop markers for the remainder of the force to aim at. Later in the war, the Pathfinder Force would be equipped with a range of newly developed and often highly effective electronic aids, but the initial object was to simply take experienced crews with standard equipment and hone their navigation skills.\n\nHaving already demonstrated that he could pass on his meticulous navigational ability to others, Bennett was an obvious choice for the role, yet nevertheless a surprising one. The [[Air Ministry]]'s Directorate of Bomber Operations had for some time been pushing to establish an elite precision bombing force, but Bomber Command AOC-in-C Air Chief Marshal [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]] was implacably opposed to the idea on the grounds that it would \"lower the morale\" of the other squadrons.\n\nWhen Harris learned that Vice-Chief of the Air Staff Sir [[Wilfrid Freeman]] planned to order the change, and that the strong-willed [[Basil Embry]] would probably be given command of the new force, Harris bowed to the inevitable, but was given a \"more or less free hand\" in selection of the force commander. He chose to appoint Bennett without considering other candidates. Harris described Bennett as \"the most efficient airman I have ever met\".<ref>Maynard p83</ref> Bennett was called to Bomber Command HQ when he was on the point of leaving with his squadron for the Middle East.

As Harris wrote, \"he could not suffer fools gladly, and by his own high standards there were many fools\". Nor did Bennett get on well with the other RAF group commanders: not only was he 20&nbsp;years younger, he was an Australian.

He resigned his commission in the RAF,<ref>https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37146/supplement/3318</ref> and returned to private life to pursue a variety of activities. He became a director of [[British South American Airways]], and designed and built both cars ([[Fairthorpe Cars|Fairthorpes]]) and light aircraft.\n\nOne of his darkest hours after the war came on 12 March 1950, when an aircraft operated on charter by his airline Fairflight [[Llandow air disaster|crashed at Llandow in Wales]].\n\nBennett became one of the shortest-serving [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) of the 20th century when he was elected at a [[1945 Middlesbrough West by-election|by-election in 1945]]<ref>https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37085/page/2575</ref> as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MP for [[Middlesbrough West (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesbrough West]].

He was successful and Blackbushe reopened on 6 October 1962. Bennett fought a planning battle with local councils to develop Blackbushe with new hangar facilities. At the time he faced a lot of opposition from local residents, councils, and the ministry. Ultimately many of the efforts to establish modern facilities at Blackbushe were unsuccessful, and he subsequently sold the airport to Doug Arnold.\n\nDon Bennett died at the age of 76 on [[Battle of Britain|Battle of Britain Day]]: 15 September 1986.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United Kingdom MPs with the shortest service]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*[http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/BennettD.htm Air of Authority \u2013 A History of RAF Organisation \u2013 AVM Bennett]\n* D.C.T.

He was successful and Blackbushe reopened on 6 October 1962. Bennett fought a planning battle with local councils to develop Blackbushe with new hangar facilities. At the time he faced a lot of opposition from local residents, councils, and the ministry. Ultimately many of the efforts to establish modern facilities at Blackbushe were unsuccessful, and he subsequently sold the airport to Doug Arnold.\n\nDon Bennett died at the age of 76 on [[Battle of Britain|Battle of Britain Day]]: 15 September 1986.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United Kingdom MPs with the shortest service]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*[http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/BennettD.htm Air of Authority \u2013 A History of RAF Organisation \u2013 AVM Bennett]\n* D.C.T.

The EP is a follow-up companion to her debut album, ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010). Originally, the record was thought to be released as a deluxe edition of ''Animal'', but was instead sold and released as both an EP and a deluxe edition of ''Animal''. Kesha worked with a variety of producers and writers such as executive producer [[Dr. Luke]], [[Benny Blanco]], [[Ammo (musician)|Ammo]], [[Max Martin]], Bangladesh and others. Musically, the songs on ''Cannibal'' are of the [[dance-pop]] genre, with some songs incorporating elements of [[Electro music|electro]] and [[electropop]] in their production and beats. Throughout the album, the use of [[Auto-Tune]] and [[vocoder]]s is prominent. Lyrically, the songs on ''Cannibal'' speak of ignoring judgement or hate and experiences based on love and heartbreak.\n\n''Cannibal'' received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. However, a common complaint amongst critics was the overuse of Auto-Tune, while the album's production was generally highlighted. The album's lyrics generally polarized music critics; some praised her boldness, while others criticized them as being too raunchy. In the United States, the EP reached a peak of fifteen on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, selling 74,000 copies in its first week of release. In Canada, the album achieved similar success, reaching a peak of fourteen on the country's albums chart. ''Cannibal'' was certified [[RIAA certifications|Platinum]] in 2018 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for sales of 1,000,000 copies.\n\nTwo singles were released from the album. The lead single, \"[[We R Who We R]]\", was a worldwide success, reaching number one in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and charting within the top ten in numerous other countries. In the United States, the song became the seventeenth song in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]'s history to debut at number one. The album's second single, \"[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]]\", was released on February 8, 2011. The song reached top ten positions in multiple countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Kesha promoted the EP and her debut album by her first headlining concert tour, entitled the [[Get Sleazy Tour]], in 2011. In January 2020, the title track \u201c[[Cannibal (Kesha song)|Cannibal]]\u201d enjoyed a resurgence in popularity due to its use on social media site TikTok. The song went so far as to reach the top forty on the [[Canadian Hot 100]].\n\n==Background and development==\n{{Quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=\"This year has been carnivorous and life-changing.

Grischow was critical of the production of the album and overuse of [[Auto-Tune]] writing that there was \"so much overdubbing and autotune used that most of the songs may as well be sung by a spunky robot\". He also noted that when Kesha's vocals were stripped down she could actually sing, highlighting the ballads \"The Harold Song\" and \"C U Next Tuesday\" in the album's review.<ref name=\"Grischow\">{{cite web|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/113/1135585p1.html |title=Kesha: Cannibal Review.

The EP is a follow-up companion to her debut album, ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010). Originally, the record was thought to be released as a deluxe edition of ''Animal'', but was instead sold and released as both an EP and a deluxe edition of ''Animal''. Kesha worked with a variety of producers and writers such as executive producer [[Dr. Luke]], [[Benny Blanco]], [[Ammo (musician)|Ammo]], [[Max Martin]], Bangladesh and others. Musically, the songs on ''Cannibal'' are of the [[dance-pop]] genre, with some songs incorporating elements of [[Electro music|electro]] and [[electropop]] in their production and beats. Throughout the album, the use of [[Auto-Tune]] and [[vocoder]]s is prominent. Lyrically, the songs on ''Cannibal'' speak of ignoring judgement or hate and experiences based on love and heartbreak.\n\n''Cannibal'' received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. However, a common complaint amongst critics was the overuse of Auto-Tune, while the album's production was generally highlighted. The album's lyrics generally polarized music critics; some praised her boldness, while others criticized them as being too raunchy. In the United States, the EP reached a peak of fifteen on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, selling 74,000 copies in its first week of release. In Canada, the album achieved similar success, reaching a peak of fourteen on the country's albums chart. ''Cannibal'' was certified [[RIAA certifications|Platinum]] in 2018 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for sales of 1,000,000 copies.\n\nTwo singles were released from the album. The lead single, \"[[We R Who We R]]\", was a worldwide success, reaching number one in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and charting within the top ten in numerous other countries. In the United States, the song became the seventeenth song in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]'s history to debut at number one. The album's second single, \"[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]]\", was released on February 8, 2011. The song reached top ten positions in multiple countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Kesha promoted the EP and her debut album by her first headlining concert tour, entitled the [[Get Sleazy Tour]], in 2011. In January 2020, the title track \u201cCannibal\u201d enjoyed a resurgence in popularity due to its use on social media site TikTok. The song went so far as to reach the top forty on the [[Canadian Hot 100]].\n\n==Background and development==\n{{Quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=\"This year has been carnivorous and life-changing.

Grischow was critical of the production of the album and overuse of [[Auto-Tune]] writing that there was \"so much overdubbing and autotune used that most of the songs may as well be sung by a spunky robot\".

Pear\", \"she emasculates a potential boyfriend.\" The production of the album was stated as a positive, praising Dr. Luke for his consistent club-pop hooks and ability to \"render the hypocrisy [of the album] nearly irrelevant.\"<ref name=\"Walters\"/> Mesfin Fekadu from ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' was mixed in his review of the album.<ref name=\"Fekadu\"/> Fekadu criticized the album's lyrical depth and use of auto-tune writing that the album was \"filled with vapid lyrics and battles any T-Pain album for most use of the auto-tune.\" Kesha's mother, Pebe, was also targeted in the review criticizing her for helping write the album's title track, \"Cannibal\" which was called \"disturbing\" and \"sad\".<ref name=\"Fekadu\">{{cite

Many of the huge cast danced in ''Minstrel Days''. Jolson himself did not play a major role in the musical numbers, and was always alone on the stage when he sang.{{sfn|Hirsch|2000|p=104}}\nAccording to Jolson's biographer Michael Freedland, ''Robinson Crusoe, Jr.'' was \"the nearest Jolson had yet come to a show with a real plot ... although from opening night on, it was quite plain that the story was not going to interfere with his domination on stage.\"{{sfn|Bordman|2010|p=363}}\n\n==Songs==\n* Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go with Friday on Saturday Night?

It is based on ''Tevye and his Daughters'' (or ''Tevye the Dairyman'') and other tales by [[Sholem Aleichem]]. The story centers on [[Tevye]], the father of five daughters, and his attempts to maintain his [[Jewish]] religious and cultural traditions as outside influences encroach upon the family's lives. He must cope both with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters, who wish to marry for love \u2013 each one's choice of a husband moves further away from the customs of their Jewish faith and heritage \u2013 and with the edict of the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] that evicts the Jews from their village.\n\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of the show, which opened in 1964, had the first musical theatre run in history to surpass 3,000 performances. ''Fiddler'' held the record for the [[List of Broadway shows that have held title of longest-running show|longest-running Broadway musical]] for almost 10 years until ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' surpassed its run. The production was extraordinarily profitable and highly acclaimed. It won nine [[Tony Award]]s, including best musical, score, book, direction and choreography. It spawned five Broadway revivals and a highly successful [[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|1971 film adaptation]] and has enjoyed enduring international popularity. It has also been a popular choice for school and community productions.<ref>[[Michael Paulson|Paulson, Michael]].

At Tevye's home, everyone is busy preparing for the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] meal. His sharp-tongued wife, Golde, orders their daughters, Tzeitel, Hodel, Chava, Shprintze and Bielke, about their tasks. Yente, the village [[Shidduch|matchmaker]], arrives to tell Golde that Lazar Wolf, the wealthy butcher, a widower older than Tevye, wants to wed Tzeitel, the eldest daughter. The next two daughters, Hodel and Chava, are excited about Yente's visit, but Tzeitel illustrates how it could have bad results (\"[[Matchmaker, Matchmaker]]\"). A girl from a poor family must take whatever husband Yente brings, but Tzeitel wants to marry her childhood friend, Motel the tailor.\n\nTevye is delivering milk, pulling the cart himself, as his horse is lame. He asks God: Whom would it hurt \"[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]\"?  The bookseller tells Tevye news from the outside world of [[pogroms]] and expulsions. A stranger, Perchik, hears their conversation and scolds them for doing nothing more than talk. The men dismiss Perchik as a radical, but Tevye invites him home for the Sabbath meal and offers him food and a room in exchange for tutoring his two youngest daughters. Golde tells Tevye to meet Lazar after the Sabbath but does not tell him why, knowing that Tevye does not like Lazar. Tzeitel is afraid that Yente will find her a husband before Motel asks Tevye for her hand. But Motel resists: he is afraid of Tevye's temper, and tradition says that a matchmaker arranges marriages. Motel is also very poor and is saving up to buy a sewing machine before he approaches Tevye, to show that he can support a wife. The family gathers for the \"Sabbath Prayer.\"\n\nAfter the Sabbath, Tevye meets Lazar for a drink at the village inn, assuming mistakenly that Lazar wants to buy his cow. Once the misunderstanding is cleared up, Tevye agrees to let Lazar marry Tzeitel \u2013 with a rich butcher, his daughter will never want for anything. All join in the celebration of Lazar's good fortune; even the Russian youths at the inn join in the celebration and show off their dancing skills (\"To Life\"). Outside the inn, Tevye happens upon the Russian Constable, who has jurisdiction over the Jews in the town. The Constable warns him that there is going to be a \"little unofficial demonstration\" in the coming weeks (a [[euphemism]] for a minor [[pogrom]]). The Constable has sympathy for the Jewish community but is powerless to prevent the violence.\n\nThe next morning, after Perchik's lessons with the younger sisters, Tevye's second daughter Hodel mocks Perchik's Marxist interpretation of a Bible story. He, in turn, criticizes her for hanging on to the old traditions of Judaism, noting that the world is changing. To illustrate this, he dances with her, defying the prohibition against opposite sexes dancing together. The two begin to fall in love. Later, a [[Hangover|hungover]] Tevye announces that he has agreed that Tzeitel will marry Lazar Wolf. Golde is overjoyed, but Tzeitel is devastated and begs Tevye not to force her. Motel arrives and tells Tevye that he is the perfect match for Tzeitel and that he and Tzeitel gave each other a pledge to marry. He promises that Tzeitel will not starve as his wife. Tevye is stunned and outraged at this breach of tradition, but impressed at the timid tailor's display of backbone. After some soul-searching (\"Tevye's Monologue\"), Tevye agrees to let them marry, but he worries about how to break the news to Golde. An overjoyed Motel celebrates with Tzeitel (\"Miracle of Miracles\").\n\nIn bed with Golde, Tevye pretends to be waking from a nightmare. Golde offers to interpret his dream, and Tevye \"describes\" it (\"Tevye's Dream\"). Golde's grandmother Tzeitel returns from the grave to bless the marriage of her namesake, but to Motel, not to Lazar Wolf. Lazar's formidable late wife, Fruma-Sarah, rises from her grave to warn, in graphic terms, of severe retribution if Tzeitel marries Lazar. The superstitious Golde is terrified, and she quickly counsels that Tzeitel must marry Motel. While returning from town, Tevye's third daughter, the bookish Chava, is teased and intimidated by some gentile youths. One, Fyedka, protects her, dismissing the others. He offers Chava the loan of a book, and a secret relationship begins.\n\nThe wedding day of Tzeitel and Motel arrives, and all the Jews join the ceremony (\"Sunrise, Sunset\") and the celebration (\"The Wedding Dance\"). Lazar gives a fine gift, but an argument arises with Tevye over the broken agreement. Perchik ends the tiff by breaking another tradition: he crosses the barrier between the men and women to dance with Tevye's daughter Hodel. The celebration ends abruptly when a group of Russians rides into the village to perform the \"demonstration\".  They disrupt the party, damaging the wedding gifts and wounding Perchik, who attempts to fight back, and wreak more destruction in the village. Tevye instructs his family to clean up the mess.\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 17388 Fiddler on the Roof in Netanya.JPG|thumb|right|''Fiddler On the Roof'' by Lev Segal in [[Netanya]], Israel]]\nMonths later, Perchik tells Hodel he must return to Kiev to work for the [[1905 Russian Revolution|revolution]]. He proposes marriage, admitting that he loves her, and says that he will send for her. She agrees (\"Now I Have Everything\"). They tell Tevye that they are engaged, and he is appalled that they are flouting tradition by making their own match, especially as Perchik is leaving. When he forbids the marriage, Perchik and Hodel inform him that they do not seek his permission, only his blessing. After more soul searching, Tevye relents \u2013 the world is changing, and he must change with it (\"Tevye's Rebuttal\"). He informs the young couple that he gives them his blessing ''and'' his permission.\n\nTevye explains these events to an astonished Golde. \"Love,\" he says, \"it's the new style.\" Tevye asks Golde, despite their own arranged marriage, \"Do You Love Me?\" After dismissing Tevye's question as foolish, she eventually admits that, after 25 years of living and struggling together and raising five daughters, she does. Meanwhile, Yente tells Tzeitel that she saw Chava with Fyedka.  News spreads quickly in Anatevka that Perchik has been arrested and exiled to [[Siberia]] (\"The Rumor/I Just Heard\"), and Hodel is determined to join him there. At the railway station, she explains to her father that her home is with her beloved, wherever he may be, although she will always love her family (\"Far From the Home I Love\").\n\nTime passes. Motel has purchased a used sewing machine, and he and Tzeitel have had a baby. Chava finally gathers the courage to ask Tevye to allow her marriage to Fyedka. Again Tevye reaches deep into his soul, but marriage outside the Jewish [[faith]] is a line he will not cross. He forbids Chava to speak to Fyedka again. When Golde brings news that Chava has [[eloped]] with Fyedka, Tevye wonders where he went wrong (\"Chavaleh Sequence\"). Chava returns and tries to reason with him, but he refuses to speak to her and tells the rest of the family to consider her dead. Meanwhile, rumors are spreading of the Russians expelling Jews from their villages. While the villagers are gathered, the Constable arrives to tell everyone that they have three days to pack up and leave the town. In shock, they reminisce about \"Anatevka\" and how hard it will be to leave what has been their home for so long.\n\nAs the Jews leave Anatevka, Chava and Fyedka stop to tell her family that they are also leaving for [[Krak\u00f3w]], unwilling to remain among the people who could do such things to others. Tevye still will not talk to her, but when Tzeitel says goodbye to Chava, Tevye prompts her to add \"God be with you.\"  Motel and Tzeitel go to Poland as well but will join the rest of the family when they have saved up enough money. As Tevye, Golde and their two youngest daughters leave the village for America, the fiddler begins to play. Tevye beckons with a nod, and the fiddler follows them out of the village.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* \"Prologue: [[Tradition (song)|Tradition]]\" \u2013 Tevye and Company\n* \"[[Matchmaker, Matchmaker]]\" \u2013 Tzeitel, Hodel and Chava\n* \"[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]\" \u2013 Tevye\n* \"Sabbath Prayer\" \u2013 Tevye, Golde, Company\n* \"[[To Life (song)|To Life]]\" \u2013 Tevye, Lazar Wolf, Russian soloist and Men\n* \"Tevye's Monologue\" \u2013 Tevye\n* \"Miracle of Miracles\" \u2013 Motel\n* \"Tevye's Dream\" \u2013 Tevye, Golde, Grandma Tzeitel, Rabbi, Fruma-Sarah and Company\n* \"[[Sunrise, Sunset]]\" \u2013 Tevye, Golde, Perchik, Hodel and Company\n* \"The Bottle Dance\" \u2013 Instrumental\n{{col-break}}\n\n; Act II\n* \"Entr'acte\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"Now I Have Everything\" \u2013 Perchik and Hodel\n* \"Tevye's Rebuttal\" \u2013 Tevye\n* \"[[Do You Love Me?

At Tevye's home, everyone is busy preparing for the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] meal. His sharp-tongued wife, Golde, orders their daughters, Tzeitel, Hodel, Chava, Shprintze and Bielke, about their tasks. Yente, the village [[Shidduch|matchmaker]], arrives to tell Golde that Lazar Wolf, the wealthy butcher, a widower older than Tevye, wants to wed Tzeitel, the eldest daughter. The next two daughters, Hodel and Chava, are excited about Yente's visit, but Tzeitel illustrates how it could have bad results (\"[[Matchmaker, Matchmaker]]\"). A girl from a poor family must take whatever husband Yente brings, but Tzeitel wants to marry her childhood friend, Motel the tailor.\n\nTevye is delivering milk, pulling the cart himself, as his horse is lame. He asks God: Whom would it hurt \"[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]\"?  The bookseller tells Tevye news from the outside world of [[pogroms]] and expulsions. A stranger, Perchik, hears their conversation and scolds them for doing nothing more than talk. The men dismiss Perchik as a radical, but Tevye invites him home for the Sabbath meal and offers him food and a room in exchange for tutoring his two youngest daughters. Golde tells Tevye to meet Lazar after the Sabbath but does not tell him why, knowing that Tevye does not like Lazar. Tzeitel is afraid that Yente will find her a husband before Motel asks Tevye for her hand. But Motel resists: he is afraid of Tevye's temper, and tradition says that a matchmaker arranges marriages. Motel is also very poor and is saving up to buy a sewing machine before he approaches Tevye, to show that he can support a wife. The family gathers for the \"Sabbath Prayer.\"\n\nAfter the Sabbath, Tevye meets Lazar for a drink at the village inn, assuming mistakenly that Lazar wants to buy his cow. Once the misunderstanding is cleared up, Tevye agrees to let Lazar marry Tzeitel \u2013 with a rich butcher, his daughter will never want for anything. All join in the celebration of Lazar's good fortune; even the Russian youths at the inn join in the celebration and show off their dancing skills (\"To Life\"). Outside the inn, Tevye happens upon the Russian Constable, who has jurisdiction over the Jews in the town. The Constable warns him that there is going to be a \"little unofficial demonstration\" in the coming weeks (a [[euphemism]] for a minor [[pogrom]]). The Constable has sympathy for the Jewish community but is powerless to prevent the violence.\n\nThe next morning, after Perchik's lessons with the younger sisters, Tevye's second daughter Hodel mocks Perchik's Marxist interpretation of a Bible story. He, in turn, criticizes her for hanging on to the old traditions of Judaism, noting that the world is changing. To illustrate this, he dances with her, defying the prohibition against opposite sexes dancing together. The two begin to fall in love. Later, a [[Hangover|hungover]] Tevye announces that he has agreed that Tzeitel will marry Lazar Wolf. Golde is overjoyed, but Tzeitel is devastated and begs Tevye not to force her. Motel arrives and tells Tevye that he is the perfect match for Tzeitel and that he and Tzeitel gave each other a pledge to marry. He promises that Tzeitel will not starve as his wife. Tevye is stunned and outraged at this breach of tradition, but impressed at the timid tailor's display of backbone. After some soul-searching (\"Tevye's Monologue\"), Tevye agrees to let them marry, but he worries about how to break the news to Golde. An overjoyed Motel celebrates with Tzeitel (\"Miracle of Miracles\").\n\nIn bed with Golde, Tevye pretends to be waking from a nightmare. Golde offers to interpret his dream, and Tevye \"describes\" it (\"Tevye's Dream\"). Golde's grandmother Tzeitel returns from the grave to bless the marriage of her namesake, but to Motel, not to Lazar Wolf. Lazar's formidable late wife, Fruma-Sarah, rises from her grave to warn, in graphic terms, of severe retribution if Tzeitel marries Lazar. The superstitious Golde is terrified, and she quickly counsels that Tzeitel must marry Motel. While returning from town, Tevye's third daughter, the bookish Chava, is teased and intimidated by some gentile youths. One, Fyedka, protects her, dismissing the others. He offers Chava the loan of a book, and a secret relationship begins.\n\nThe wedding day of Tzeitel and Motel arrives, and all the Jews join the ceremony (\"Sunrise, Sunset\") and the celebration (\"The Wedding Dance\"). Lazar gives a fine gift, but an argument arises with Tevye over the broken agreement. Perchik ends the tiff by breaking another tradition: he crosses the barrier between the men and women to dance with Tevye's daughter Hodel. The celebration ends abruptly when a group of Russians rides into the village to perform the \"demonstration\".  They disrupt the party, damaging the wedding gifts and wounding Perchik, who attempts to fight back, and wreak more destruction in the village. Tevye instructs his family to clean up the mess.\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 17388 Fiddler on the Roof in Netanya.JPG|thumb|right|''Fiddler On the Roof'' by Lev Segal in [[Netanya]], Israel]]\nMonths later, Perchik tells Hodel he must return to Kiev to work for the [[1905 Russian Revolution|revolution]]. He proposes marriage, admitting that he loves her, and says that he will send for her. She agrees (\"Now I Have Everything\"). They tell Tevye that they are engaged, and he is appalled that they are flouting tradition by making their own match, especially as Perchik is leaving. When he forbids the marriage, Perchik and Hodel inform him that they do not seek his permission, only his blessing. After more soul searching, Tevye relents \u2013 the world is changing, and he must change with it (\"Tevye's Rebuttal\"). He informs the young couple that he gives them his blessing ''and'' his permission.\n\nTevye explains these events to an astonished Golde. \"Love,\" he says, \"it's the new style.\" Tevye asks Golde, despite their own arranged marriage, \"Do You Love Me?\" After dismissing Tevye's question as foolish, she eventually admits that, after 25 years of living and struggling together and raising five daughters, she does. Meanwhile, Yente tells Tzeitel that she saw Chava with Fyedka.  News spreads quickly in Anatevka that Perchik has been arrested and exiled to [[Siberia]] (\"The Rumor/I Just Heard\"), and Hodel is determined to join him there. At the railway station, she explains to her father that her home is with her beloved, wherever he may be, although she will always love her family (\"Far From the Home I Love\").\n\nTime passes. Motel has purchased a used sewing machine, and he and Tzeitel have had a baby. Chava finally gathers the courage to ask Tevye to allow her marriage to Fyedka. Again Tevye reaches deep into his soul, but marriage outside the Jewish [[faith]] is a line he will not cross. He forbids Chava to speak to Fyedka again. When Golde brings news that Chava has [[eloped]] with Fyedka, Tevye wonders where he went wrong (\"Chavaleh Sequence\"). Chava returns and tries to reason with him, but he refuses to speak to her and tells the rest of the family to consider her dead. Meanwhile, rumors are spreading of the Russians expelling Jews from their villages. While the villagers are gathered, the Constable arrives to tell everyone that they have three days to pack up and leave the town. In shock, they reminisce about \"Anatevka\" and how hard it will be to leave what has been their home for so long.\n\nAs the Jews leave Anatevka, Chava and Fyedka stop to tell her family that they are also leaving for [[Krak\u00f3w]], unwilling to remain among the people who could do such things to others. Tevye still will not talk to her, but when Tzeitel says goodbye to Chava, Tevye prompts her to add \"God be with you.\"  Motel and Tzeitel go to Poland as well but will join the rest of the family when they have saved up enough money. As Tevye, Golde and their two youngest daughters leave the village for America, the fiddler begins to play. Tevye beckons with a nod, and the fiddler follows them out of the village.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* \"Prologue: [[Tradition (song)|Tradition]]\" \u2013 Tevye and Company\n* \"[[Matchmaker, Matchmaker]]\" \u2013 Tzeitel, Hodel and Chava\n* \"[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]\" \u2013 Tevye\n* \"Sabbath Prayer\" \u2013 Tevye, Golde, Company\n* \"[[To Life (song)|To Life]]\" \u2013 Tevye, Lazar Wolf, Russian soloist and Men\n* \"Tevye's Monologue\" \u2013 Tevye\n* \"Miracle of Miracles\" \u2013 Motel\n* \"Tevye's Dream\" \u2013 Tevye, Golde, Grandma Tzeitel, Rabbi, Fruma-Sarah and Company\n* \"[[Sunrise, Sunset]]\" \u2013 Tevye, Golde, Perchik, Hodel and Company\n* \"The Bottle Dance\" \u2013 Instrumental\n{{col-break}}\n\n; Act II\n* \"Entr'acte\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"Now I Have Everything\" \u2013 Perchik and Hodel\n* \"Tevye's Rebuttal\" \u2013 Tevye\n* \"[[Do You Love Me?

He wrote the first web browser [[WorldWideWeb]], later renamed Nexus, and released it for the [[NeXTstep]] platform in 1991.\n\nBy the end of 1992 other browsers had appeared, many of them based on the [[libwww]] library. These included [[Unix]] browsers such as [[Line Mode Browser]], [[ViolaWWW]], [[Erwise]], and [[MidasWWW]], and [[MacWWW]]/Samba for the Mac. Even though these browsers tended to be simple HTML viewers, relying on external [[helper application]]s to view multimedia content, they provided choice to users both in browsers and platforms.\n\n==Mosaic Wars==\nFurther browsers were released in 1993, including [[Cello (web browser)|Cello]], [[Arena (web browser)|Arena]], [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]], [[tkWWW]], and [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]]. The most influential of these was Mosaic, a multiplatform browser developed at [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (NCSA). By October 1994, Mosaic was \"well on its way to becoming the world's standard interface\", according to Gary Wolfe of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/mosaic.html |title=The (Second Phase of the) Revolution Has Begun |date=October 1994 |accessdate=2012-04-24 |last=Wolfe |first=Gary |publisher=Wired Magazine}}</ref>\n\nSeveral companies licensed Mosaic to create their own commercial browsers, such as [[AirMosaic]] and [[Spyglass Mosaic]]. One of the Mosaic developers, [[Marc Andreessen]], co-founded the Mosaic Communications Corporation and created a new web browser named Mosaic Netscape.\n\n{{quote|There are two ages of the Internet\u2014before Mosaic, and after.

The Netscape browser improved on Mosaic's usability and reliability and was able to display pages as they loaded. By 1995, helped by the fact that it was free for non-commercial use, the browser dominated the emerging World Wide Web.\n\nOther browsers launched during 1994 included [[IBM Web Explorer]], [[Navipress]], [[SlipKnot (web browser)|SlipKnot]], [[MacWeb]], and [[Browse (web browser)|Browse]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Berghel|first=Hal|title=Hal Berghel's Cybernautica|url=http://berghel.net/col-edit/cybernautica/jan-feb96/pcai961.php|accessdate=14 November 2010|date=2 April 1996}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Netscape faced new competition from [[OmniWeb]], [[WebRouser]], [[UdiWWW]], and Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer version history|Internet Explorer 1.0]], but continued to dominate the market.\n\n==First Browser War (1995\u20132001) {{anchor|First_Browser_War}}==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}\n{{POV section|date=November 2017}}\n<br />[[File:Browser Wars (en).svg|thumb|300px|Market share for several browsers between 1995 and 2010.

The release party in San Francisco featured a ten-foot-tall letter \"e\" logo. Netscape employees showing up to work the following morning found the logo on their front lawn, with a sign attached that read \"From the IE team ...We Love You.\"<ref name=\"Swartz\"/> The Netscape employees promptly knocked it over and set a giant figure of their [[Mozilla (mascot)|Mozilla]] dinosaur mascot atop it, holding a sign reading \"Netscape 72, Microsoft 18\" representing the market distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.snafu.de/tilman/mozilla/stomps.html |title=Mozilla stomps IE |publisher=Home.snafu.de |date=1997-10-02 |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref>\n\nInternet Explorer 4 changed the tides of the browser wars. It was integrated into Microsoft Windows, which gave it a large installation base.\n\nDuring these releases, it was common for web designers to display 'best viewed in Netscape' or 'best viewed in Internet Explorer' logos. These images often identified a specific browser version and were commonly linked to a source from which the stated browser could be downloaded. These logos generally recognized the divergence between the standards supported by the browsers and signified which browser was used for testing the pages. In response, supporters of the principle that web sites should be compliant with [[World Wide Web Consortium]] standards and hence viewable with any browser started the \"Viewable With Any Browser\" campaign, which employed its own logo similar to the partisan ones. Most mainstream web sites, however, specified one of Netscape or IE as their preferred browser while making some attempt to support minimal functionality on the other.\n\nWhile Netscape began with about 80% market share and a good deal of public goodwill, as a relatively small company deriving the great bulk of its income from what was essentially a single product (Navigator and its derivatives), it was financially vulnerable. The company's total revenue never exceeded the income generated by Microsoft's funds that were readily available for use. Microsoft's resources allowed them to make Internet Explorer available without charge, as the revenues from Windows were used to fund its development and marketing. As a result, Internet Explorer was provided free for all Windows and Macintosh users, unlike Netscape which was free for home and educational use but would require a paid license for business use; as it was told by [[Jim Barksdale]], President and CEO of Netscape Communications: \"Very few times in warfare have smaller forces overtaken bigger forces...\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netvalley.com/cgi-bin/intval/net_history.pl?chapter=4 |title=Roads and Crossroads of the Internet History |work=NetValley.com|date= |accessdate=2011-02-14 }}</ref>\n\nMicrosoft bundled Internet Explorer with every copy of Windows, which had an over 90% share of the desktop operating system market, allowing the company to obtain market share more easily than Netscape, as customers already had Internet Explorer installed as the default browser. In this time period, many new computer purchasers had never extensively used a web browser before. Consequently, the buyer did not have anything else to compare with and little motivation to consider alternatives; the set of abilities they had gained with access to the Internet and the World Wide Web made any difference in browser features or ergonomics pale in comparison.\n\nDuring the [[United States Microsoft antitrust case]] in 1998, government witness and [[Intel]] vice president [[Steven McGeady]] testified that a senior executive at Microsoft told him in 1995 of his company's intention to \"cut off Netscape's air supply\", although a Microsoft attorney [[Hearsay|rejected McGeady's testimony as not credible]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/microsoft/stories/1998/microsoft111398.htm |title=Microsoft Attacks Credibility of Intel Exec |date=November 1998 |accessdate=2009-12-01 |last=Chandrasekaran |first=Rajiv |publisher=Washington Post}}</ref> That same year, Netscape, the company, was acquired by [[AOL|America Online]] for [[United States dollar|US$]]4.2&nbsp;billion. Internet Explorer became the new dominant browser, attaining a peak of about 96% of the [[usage share of web browsers|web browser usage share]] during 2001.<ref>http://amo.net/NT/01-30-01MSFTIE6.html</ref>\n\nThe first browser war ended with Internet Explorer having no remaining serious competition for its market share. This also brought an end to the rapid innovation in web browsers; until 2006 there was only one new version of Internet Explorer since [[Internet Explorer 6|version 6.0]] had been released in 2001. Internet Explorer 6.0 Service Pack 1 was developed as part of [[Windows XP Service Pack 1]] and was also integrated into [[Windows Server 2003]]. Further enhancements were made to Internet Explorer in [[Windows XP Service Pack 2]] (released in 2004), including a pop-up blocker and stronger default security settings regarding the installation of ActiveX controls.\n\n==Second Browser War (2004\u20132017)==\n[[File:Wikipedia Main Page in Firefox 2.0.0.12.png|thumb|Firefox 2.0, shown here, was released in October 2006]]\n\nAt the start of Netscape Navigator's decline, Netscape open-sourced their browser code, and later entrusted it to the newly formed non-profit [[Mozilla Foundation]]&mdash;a primarily community-driven project to create a successor to Netscape. Development continued for several years with little widespread adoption until a stripped-down browser-only version of the full suite, which included new features such as a separate search bar (which had previously only appeared in the Opera browser), was created. The browser-only version was initially named ''[[Mozilla Phoenix|Phoenix]]'', but because of [[History of Firefox#Naming|trademark issues]] that name was changed, first to ''Firebird'', then to ''[[Firefox]]''. This browser became the focus of the Mozilla Foundation's development efforts and Mozilla Firefox 1.0 was released on November 9, 2004. It then continued to gain an increasing share of the browser market until a peak in 2010.\n\nIn 2003, Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 would be the last standalone version of its browser. Future enhancements would be dependent on [[Windows Vista]], which would include new tools such as the [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]] and [[Extensible Application Markup Language|XAML]] to enable developers to build web applications.\n\nIn response, in April 2004, the Mozilla Foundation and [[Opera Software]] joined efforts to develop new open-technology standards which add more capability while remaining backward-compatible with existing technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/papers/opera.html |title=Position Paper for the W3C Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref> The result of this collaboration was the [[WHATWG]], a working group devoted to the fast creation of new standard definitions that would be submitted to the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] for approval.\n\nThe growing number of device/browser combinations in use, legally-mandated [[web accessibility]], as well as the expansion of expected web functionality to essentially require DOM and scripting abilities, including AJAX, made [[web standards]] of increasing importance during this era. Instead of touting their proprietary extensions, browser developers began to market their software based on how closely it adhered to the behavior as specified by the standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/The_Business_Benefits_of_Web_Standards|title=The Business Benefits of Web Standards|quote=In such an increasingly heterogeneous environment, testing each web page in every configuration is impossible.

The software, however, was commercial, which hampered its adoption compared to its free rivals until 2005, when the browser became [[freeware]]. On June 20, 2006, Opera Software released [[Opera 9]] including an integrated source viewer, a [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] client implementation, and widgets. It was the first Windows browser to pass the [[Acid2]] test. [[Opera Mini]], a mobile browser, has significant mobile market share. Editions of Opera are also available for the [[Nintendo DS & DSi Browser|Nintendo DS]] and the [[Internet Channel|Wii]].\n\nMicrosoft released Internet Explorer 7 on October 18, 2006. It included tabbed browsing, a search bar, a [[phishing]] filter, and improved support for web standards (including full support for [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]])\u2014all features already long familiar to Opera and Firefox users.

[[HTML4]] and [[CSS2]] were the standard in most browsers in 2006. However, new features being added to browsers from [[HTML5]] and [[CSS3]] specifications were quickly making their mark by 2010, especially in the emerging [[mobile browser]] market where new ways of animating and rendering for various screen sizes were to become the norm.

By the end of 2011, however, Chrome overtook Firefox to become world's most used browser, and the competition between Chrome and Firefox intensified.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/press/chrome-overtakes-firefox-globally-for-first-time|title=Chrome Overtakes Firefox Globally for First Time|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\nDuring this era, all major web browsers implemented support for [[HTML5 video]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Supported codecs, however, varied from browser to browser. Current versions of Android, Chrome, and Firefox support Theora, H.264, and the VP8 version of WebM. Older versions of Firefox omitted H.264 due to it being a proprietary codec, but it was made available beginning in version 17 for Android and version 20 for Windows. [[Internet Explorer]] and Safari support H.264 exclusively,{{when|date=October 2017}} but the Theora and VP8 codecs can be manually installed on the desktop versions. Given the popularity of WebKit for mobile browsers, [[Opera Software]] discontinued its own Presto engine in February 2013. The Opera 12 series of browsers were the last to use Presto with its successors using WebKit instead. In 2015, Microsoft discontinued production of newer versions of Internet Explorer. By this point Chrome overtook all other browsers as the browser with the highest usage share.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.com.au/microsoft-discontinue-internet-explorer-launch-new-browser-windows-10-1430604|title=Microsoft To Discontinue Internet Explorer, To Launch New Browser For Windows 10|date=2015-03-18|website=International Business Times AU|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/the-sorry-legacy-of-microsoft-internet-explorer/|title=The Days of Microsoft Internet Explorer Are Numbered\u2014But Its Sorry Legacy Will Live On|last=Finley|first=Klint|date=2016-01-12|work=Wired|access-date=2019-02-28|issn=1059-1028}}</ref>\n\nStarting in 2015 with the release of [[Windows 10]], Microsoft shifted from Internet Explorer to [[Microsoft Edge]].

He wrote the first web browser [[WorldWideWeb]], later renamed Nexus, and released it for the [[NeXTstep]] platform in 1991.\n\nBy the end of 1992 other browsers had appeared, many of them based on the [[libwww]] library. These included [[Unix]] browsers such as [[Line Mode Browser]], [[ViolaWWW]], [[Erwise]], and [[MidasWWW]], and [[MacWWW]]/Samba for the Mac. Even though these browsers tended to be simple HTML viewers, relying on external [[helper application]]s to view multimedia content, they provided choice to users both in browsers and platforms.\n\n==Mosaic Wars==\nFurther browsers were released in 1993, including [[Cello (web browser)|Cello]], [[Arena (web browser)|Arena]], [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]], [[tkWWW]], and [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]]. The most influential of these was Mosaic, a multiplatform browser developed at [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (NCSA). By October 1994, Mosaic was \"well on its way to becoming the world's standard interface\", according to Gary Wolfe of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/mosaic.html |title=The (Second Phase of the) Revolution Has Begun |date=October 1994 |accessdate=2012-04-24 |last=Wolfe |first=Gary |publisher=Wired Magazine}}</ref>\n\nSeveral companies licensed Mosaic to create their own commercial browsers, such as [[AirMosaic]] and [[Spyglass Mosaic]]. One of the Mosaic developers, [[Marc Andreessen]], co-founded the Mosaic Communications Corporation and created a new web browser named Mosaic Netscape.\n\n{{quote|There are two ages of the Internet\u2014before Mosaic, and after.

The Netscape browser improved on Mosaic's usability and reliability and was able to display pages as they loaded. By 1995, helped by the fact that it was free for non-commercial use, the browser dominated the emerging World Wide Web.\n\nOther browsers launched during 1994 included [[IBM Web Explorer]], [[Navipress]], [[SlipKnot (web browser)|SlipKnot]], [[MacWeb]], and [[Browse (web browser)|Browse]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Berghel|first=Hal|title=Hal Berghel's Cybernautica|url=http://berghel.net/col-edit/cybernautica/jan-feb96/pcai961.php|accessdate=14 November 2010|date=2 April 1996}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Netscape faced new competition from [[OmniWeb]], [[WebRouser]], [[UdiWWW]], and Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer version history|Internet Explorer 1.0]], but continued to dominate the market.\n\n==First Browser War (1995\u20132001) {{anchor|First_Browser_War}}==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}\n{{POV section|date=November 2017}}\n<br />[[File:Browser Wars (en).svg|thumb|300px|Market share for several browsers between 1995 and 2010.

The release party in San Francisco featured a ten-foot-tall letter \"e\" logo. Netscape employees showing up to work the following morning found the logo on their front lawn, with a sign attached that read \"From the IE team ...We Love You.\"<ref name=\"Swartz\"/> The Netscape employees promptly knocked it over and set a giant figure of their [[Mozilla (mascot)|Mozilla]] dinosaur mascot atop it, holding a sign reading \"Netscape 72, Microsoft 18\" representing the market distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.snafu.de/tilman/mozilla/stomps.html |title=Mozilla stomps IE |publisher=Home.snafu.de |date=1997-10-02 |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref>\n\nInternet Explorer 4 changed the tides of the browser wars. It was integrated into Microsoft Windows, which gave it a large installation base.\n\nDuring these releases, it was common for web designers to display 'best viewed in Netscape' or 'best viewed in Internet Explorer' logos. These images often identified a specific browser version and were commonly linked to a source from which the stated browser could be downloaded. These logos generally recognized the divergence between the standards supported by the browsers and signified which browser was used for testing the pages. In response, supporters of the principle that web sites should be compliant with [[World Wide Web Consortium]] standards and hence viewable with any browser started the \"Viewable With Any Browser\" campaign, which employed its own logo similar to the partisan ones. Most mainstream web sites, however, specified one of Netscape or IE as their preferred browser while making some attempt to support minimal functionality on the other.\n\nWhile Netscape began with about 80% market share and a good deal of public goodwill, as a relatively small company deriving the great bulk of its income from what was essentially a single product (Navigator and its derivatives), it was financially vulnerable. The company's total revenue never exceeded the income generated by Microsoft's funds that were readily available for use. Microsoft's resources allowed them to make Internet Explorer available without charge, as the revenues from Windows were used to fund its development and marketing. As a result, Internet Explorer was provided free for all Windows and Macintosh users, unlike Netscape which was free for home and educational use but would require a paid license for business use; as it was told by [[Jim Barksdale]], President and CEO of Netscape Communications: \"Very few times in warfare have smaller forces overtaken bigger forces...\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netvalley.com/cgi-bin/intval/net_history.pl?chapter=4 |title=Roads and Crossroads of the Internet History |work=NetValley.com|date= |accessdate=2011-02-14 }}</ref>\n\nMicrosoft bundled Internet Explorer with every copy of Windows, which had an over 90% share of the desktop operating system market, allowing the company to obtain market share more easily than Netscape, as customers already had Internet Explorer installed as the default browser. In this time period, many new computer purchasers had never extensively used a web browser before. Consequently, the buyer did not have anything else to compare with and little motivation to consider alternatives; the set of abilities they had gained with access to the Internet and the World Wide Web made any difference in browser features or ergonomics pale in comparison.\n\nDuring the [[United States Microsoft antitrust case]] in 1998, government witness and [[Intel]] vice president [[Steven McGeady]] testified that a senior executive at Microsoft told him in 1995 of his company's intention to \"cut off Netscape's air supply\", although a Microsoft attorney [[Hearsay|rejected McGeady's testimony as not credible]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/microsoft/stories/1998/microsoft111398.htm |title=Microsoft Attacks Credibility of Intel Exec |date=November 1998 |accessdate=2009-12-01 |last=Chandrasekaran |first=Rajiv |publisher=Washington Post}}</ref> That same year, Netscape, the company, was acquired by [[AOL|America Online]] for [[United States dollar|US$]]4.2&nbsp;billion. Internet Explorer became the new dominant browser, attaining a peak of about 96% of the [[usage share of web browsers|web browser usage share]] during 2001.<ref>http://amo.net/NT/01-30-01MSFTIE6.html</ref>\n\nThe first browser war ended with Internet Explorer having no remaining serious competition for its market share. This also brought an end to the rapid innovation in web browsers; until 2006 there was only one new version of Internet Explorer since [[Internet Explorer 6|version 6.0]] had been released in 2001. Internet Explorer 6.0 Service Pack 1 was developed as part of [[Windows XP Service Pack 1]] and was also integrated into [[Windows Server 2003]]. Further enhancements were made to Internet Explorer in [[Windows XP Service Pack 2]] (released in 2004), including a pop-up blocker and stronger default security settings regarding the installation of ActiveX controls.\n\n==Second Browser War (2004\u20132017)==\n[[File:Wikipedia Main Page in Firefox 2.0.0.12.png|thumb|Firefox 2.0, shown here, was released in October 2006]]\n\nAt the start of Netscape Navigator's decline, Netscape open-sourced their browser code, and later entrusted it to the newly formed non-profit [[Mozilla Foundation]]&mdash;a primarily community-driven project to create a successor to Netscape. Development continued for several years with little widespread adoption until a stripped-down browser-only version of the full suite, which included new features such as a separate search bar (which had previously only appeared in the Opera browser), was created. The browser-only version was initially named ''[[Mozilla Phoenix|Phoenix]]'', but because of [[History of Firefox#Naming|trademark issues]] that name was changed, first to ''Firebird'', then to ''[[Firefox]]''. This browser became the focus of the Mozilla Foundation's development efforts and Mozilla Firefox 1.0 was released on November 9, 2004. It then continued to gain an increasing share of the browser market until a peak in 2010.\n\nIn 2003, Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 would be the last standalone version of its browser. Future enhancements would be dependent on [[Windows Vista]], which would include new tools such as the [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]] and [[Extensible Application Markup Language|XAML]] to enable developers to build web applications.\n\nIn response, in April 2004, the Mozilla Foundation and [[Opera Software]] joined efforts to develop new open-technology standards which add more capability while remaining backward-compatible with existing technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/papers/opera.html |title=Position Paper for the W3C Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref> The result of this collaboration was the [[WHATWG]], a working group devoted to the fast creation of new standard definitions that would be submitted to the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] for approval.\n\nThe growing number of device/browser combinations in use, legally-mandated [[web accessibility]], as well as the expansion of expected web functionality to essentially require DOM and scripting abilities, including AJAX, made [[web standards]] of increasing importance during this era. Instead of touting their proprietary extensions, browser developers began to market their software based on how closely it adhered to the behavior as specified by the standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/The_Business_Benefits_of_Web_Standards|title=The Business Benefits of Web Standards|quote=In such an increasingly heterogeneous environment, testing each web page in every configuration is impossible.

The software, however, was commercial, which hampered its adoption compared to its free rivals until 2005, when the browser became [[freeware]]. On June 20, 2006, Opera Software released [[Opera 9]] including an integrated source viewer, a [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] client implementation, and widgets. It was the first Windows browser to pass the [[Acid2]] test. [[Opera Mini]], a mobile browser, has significant mobile market share.

[[HTML4]] and [[CSS2]] were the standard in most browsers in 2006. However, new features being added to browsers from [[HTML5]] and [[CSS3]] specifications were quickly making their mark by 2010, especially in the emerging [[mobile browser]] market where new ways of animating and rendering for various screen sizes were to become the norm.

For example, it has been previously shown that a mixture of [[tricyclohexylphosphine]] (PCy<sub>3</sub>) and [[tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane]] reacts with H<sub>2</sub> to give the respective [[phosphonium]] and [[borate]] ions:\n\n<chem>PCy3 + B(C6F5)3 + H2 ->  [HPCy3]+ [HB(C6F5)3]- </chem>\n\nIn this reaction, PCy<sub>3</sub> (the Lewis Base) and B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (the Lewis Acid) cannot form an adduct due to the steric hindrance from the bulky cyclohexyl and pentafluorophenyl groups. The proton on the phosphorus and hydride from the borate are now \u2018activated\u2019 and can subsequently be \u2018delivered\u2019 to an organic substrate, resulting in [[hydrogenation]].\n\n=== Mechanism of dihydrogen activation by FLP ===\nThe mechanism for the activation of H<sub>2</sub> by FLPs has been discussed for both the intermolecular and intramolecular cases. Intermolecular FLPs are where the Lewis Base is a separate molecule to the Lewis Acid, it is thought that these individual molecules interact through secondary London dispersion interactions to bring the Lewis Base and Acid together (a pre-organisational effect) where small molecules may then interact with the FLPs. The experimental evidence for this type of interaction at the molecular level is unclear. However, there is supporting evidence for this type of interaction based on computational DFT (Density Functional Theory) studies. Intramolecular FLPs are where the Lewis Acid and Lewis Base are combined in one molecule by a covalent linker. Despite the improved \u2018pre-organisational effects\u2019, rigid intramolecular FLP frameworks are thought to have a reduced reactivity to small molecules due to a reduction in flexibility.\n\n===Dihydrogen activation example===\nThe activation of H<sub>2</sub> using FLPs was first reported in 2006.<ref name=\":1\" /> In this report a phosphonium-borate species was observed to undergo the thermal loss of a H<sub>2</sub> molecule, to generate the phosphine and the borane. The phosphonium-borate species '''1''' was prepared from B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>Me<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PH, due to the steric demands of both of these molecules a traditional adduct could not be formed and the zwitterionic phosphonic-boronate was prepared [Figure 1]. A \u201cH-for-F exchange\u201d was carried out to give '''2''' which was stable to moisture and air. This salt will release molecular H<sub>2</sub> when heated above 100 \u00b0C, a colour change was also observed from the colourless '''2''' to the orange-red '''3''' (both in THF). This reaction is reversed by reacting '''3''' with H<sub>2</sub> at 25 \u2103 where the colour change is reversed and '''2''' is reformed. The reaction of H<sub>2</sub> with '''3''' was successful for temperatures as low as 25 \u2103. Recrystallisation of '''3''' from THF afforded colourless crystals of the adduct '''4'''.  \n[[File:Synthetic Methodology for the first FLP.png|alt=Absorption and release of hydrogen from FLP|center|thumb|512x512px|Synthetic methodology for the first FLP, ('''1''') reported by Stephan ''et. al. formed from dimesityl phosphine and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane.

Hydrogenations of these unsaturated substrates can be effected by metal-catalyzed reactions. Metal-free catalytic hydrogenation was carried out using the phosphonium borate catalyst (R<sub>2</sub>PH)(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>4</sub>)BH(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (R = 2,4,6-Me<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) '''1'''. This type of metal-free hydrogenation has the potential to replace high cost metal catalyst. \n\nThe mechanism of imine reduction is proposed to involve protonation at nitrogen giving the iminium salt. The basicity of the nitrogen centre determines the rate of reaction. More electron rich imines reduce at faster rates than electron poor imines. The resulting iminium center undergoes [[nucleophilic attack]] by the borohydride anion to form the amine.  Small amines bind to the borane, quenching further reactions.  This problem can be overcome using various methods: 1) Application of elevated temperatures 2) Using [[Steric effects|sterically]] bulky imine substituents 3) Protecting the imine with the B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>group, which also serves as a Lewis acid promoter.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Enantioselective imine hydrogenation ===\nChiral boronate [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acid]] derived from (1''R'')-(''+'')-camphor form a frustrated Lewis pair with <sup>t</sup>Bu<sub>3</sub>P, which is isolable as a salt.

In terms of mechanism, the alkyne material is first [[Hydroboration|hydroborated]] and then the resulting vinylborane-based FLP can then activate dihydrogen. A protodeborylation step releases the ''cis''-alkene product, which is obtained due to the ''syn''-hydroborylation process, and regenerating the catalyst. While active for alkyne hydrogenation the FLP-based catalysts do not however facilitate the hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes.\n\n[[File:Scheme 2 wiki.svg|alt=Mechanism for hydrogenation of alkynes using FLPs|center|thumb|500x500px|Mechanism for hydrogenation of alkynes using FLPs]]The reaction is a syn-hydroboration, and as a result a high cis selectivity is observed. At the final stage of the catalytic cycle the C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub> group is cleaved more easily than an alkyl group, causing catalyst degradation rather than alkane release. The catalytic cycle has three steps:\n\n* Substrate binding (the hydroboration of alkyne)\n* H<sub>2</sub> cleavage with vinylborane, followed by intramolecular protodeborylation of vinyl substituent, recovering N,N-Dimethyl-2-[(pentafluorophenyl)boryl]aniline\n* Release of the cis-alkene\n\n[[File:FLP Alkyne Binding.png|thumb|Binding of terminal alkyne to the FLP catalyst]]\n\nWith internal alkynes, a competitive reaction occurs where the proton bound to the nitrogen can be added to the fluorobenzenes. Therefore, this addition does not proceed that much, the formation of the alkene seems favoured.\n\nBut terminal alkynes do not bind to the boron through a 1,2 insertion as the alkenes, but through an oxidative addition. Thus, the addition of the proton to the alkyne will result in the initial terminal alkyne. Hence this hydrogenation process is not suitable to terminal alkynes and will only give pentafluorobenzene.\n\n=== Borylation ===\nAmine-borane FLPs catalyse the borylation of electron-rich aromatic heterocycles (Scheme 1).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=L\u00e9gar\u00e9|first=Marc A.|last2=Courtmanche|first2=Marc A.|last3=Rochette|first3=\u00c9tienne|last4=Fontaine|first4=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric G.|date=2015-07-30|title=Metal-free catalytic C-H bond activation and borylation of heteroarenes|doi=10.1126/science.aab3591|pmid=26228143|issn=0036-8075|volume=349|issue=6247|journal=Science|pages=513\u2013516|bibcode=2015Sci...349..513L|hdl=20.500.11794/30087}}{{closed access}}</ref> The reaction is driven by release of hydrogen via C-H activation by the FLP.

First, the substrate must be electron rich, exemplified by the absence of a reaction with thiophene, whereas its more electron rich derivatives - methoxythiophene and [[3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene|3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene]] - can undergo a reaction with the amino-borane. Furthermore, substitution of 1-methylpyrrole (which can react) with the strongly electron withdrawing [[Tert-Butyloxycarbonyl protecting group|tertbutyloxycarbonyl]] (Boc) group at the 2-position completely inhibits the reaction. The second requirement is for the absence of basic amine groups in the substrate, which would otherwise form an unwanted adduct. This can be illustrated by the lack of a reaction with pyrrole, whereas both 1-methyl and N-benzylpyrrole derivatives are able to react.\n\nFurther work by the same authors revealed that simply piperidine as the amine R group (as opposed to tetramethylpiperidine, pictured above) accelerated the rate of reaction.

For example, it has been previously shown that a mixture of [[tricyclohexylphosphine]] (PCy<sub>3</sub>) and [[tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane]] reacts with H<sub>2</sub> to give the respective [[phosphonium]] and [[borate]] ions:\n\n<chem>PCy3 + B(C6F5)3 + H2 ->  [HPCy3]+ [HB(C6F5)3]- </chem>\n\nIn this reaction, PCy<sub>3</sub> (the Lewis Base) and B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (the Lewis Acid) cannot form an adduct due to the steric hindrance from the bulky cyclohexyl and pentafluorophenyl groups. The proton on the phosphorus and hydride from the borate are now \u2018activated\u2019 and can subsequently be \u2018delivered\u2019 to an organic substrate, resulting in [[hydrogenation]].\n\n=== Mechanism of dihydrogen activation by FLP ===\nThe mechanism for the activation of H<sub>2</sub> by FLPs has been discussed for both the intermolecular and intramolecular cases. Intermolecular FLPs are where the Lewis Base is a separate molecule to the Lewis Acid, it is thought that these individual molecules interact through secondary London dispersion interactions to bring the Lewis Base and Acid together (a pre-organisational effect) where small molecules may then interact with the FLPs. The experimental evidence for this type of interaction at the molecular level is unclear. However, there is supporting evidence for this type of interaction based on computational DFT (Density Functional Theory) studies. Intramolecular FLPs are where the Lewis Acid and Lewis Base are combined in one molecule by a covalent linker. Despite the improved \u2018pre-organisational effects\u2019, rigid intramolecular FLP frameworks are thought to have a reduced reactivity to small molecules due to a reduction in flexibility.\n\n===Dihydrogen activation example===\nThe activation of H<sub>2</sub> using FLPs was first reported in 2006.<ref name=\":1\" /> In this report a phosphonium-borate species was observed to undergo the thermal loss of a H<sub>2</sub> molecule, to generate the phosphine and the borane. The phosphonium-borate species '''1''' was prepared from B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>Me<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PH, due to the steric demands of both of these molecules a traditional adduct could not be formed and the zwitterionic phosphonic-boronate was prepared [Figure 1]. A \u201cH-for-F exchange\u201d was carried out to give '''2''' which was stable to moisture and air. This salt will release molecular H<sub>2</sub> when heated above 100 \u00b0C, a colour change was also observed from the colourless '''2''' to the orange-red '''3''' (both in THF). This reaction is reversed by reacting '''3''' with H<sub>2</sub> at 25 \u2103 where the colour change is reversed and '''2''' is reformed. The reaction of H<sub>2</sub> with '''3''' was successful for temperatures as low as 25 \u2103. Recrystallisation of '''3''' from THF afforded colourless crystals of the adduct '''4'''.  \n[[File:Synthetic Methodology for the first FLP.png|alt=Absorption and release of hydrogen from FLP|center|thumb|512x512px|Synthetic methodology for the first FLP, ('''1''') reported by Stephan ''et. al. formed from dimesityl phosphine and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane.

Hydrogenations of these unsaturated substrates can be effected by metal-catalyzed reactions. Metal-free catalytic hydrogenation was carried out using the phosphonium borate catalyst (R<sub>2</sub>PH)(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>4</sub>)BH(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (R = 2,4,6-Me<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) '''1'''. This type of metal-free hydrogenation has the potential to replace high cost metal catalyst. \n\nThe mechanism of imine reduction is proposed to involve protonation at nitrogen giving the iminium salt. The basicity of the nitrogen centre determines the rate of reaction. More electron rich imines reduce at faster rates than electron poor imines. The resulting iminium center undergoes [[nucleophilic attack]] by the borohydride anion to form the amine.  Small amines bind to the borane, quenching further reactions.  This problem can be overcome using various methods: 1) Application of elevated temperatures 2) Using [[Steric effects|sterically]] bulky imine substituents 3) Protecting the imine with the B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>group, which also serves as a Lewis acid promoter.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Enantioselective imine hydrogenation ===\nChiral boronate [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acid]] derived from (1''R'')-(''+'')-camphor form a frustrated Lewis pair with <sup>t</sup>Bu<sub>3</sub>P, which is isolable as a salt.

In terms of mechanism, the alkyne material is first [[Hydroboration|hydroborated]] and then the resulting vinylborane-based FLP can then activate dihydrogen. A protodeborylation step releases the ''cis''-alkene product, which is obtained due to the ''syn''-hydroborylation process, and regenerating the catalyst. While active for alkyne hydrogenation the FLP-based catalysts do not however facilitate the hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes.\n\n[[File:Scheme 2 wiki.svg|alt=Mechanism for hydrogenation of alkynes using FLPs|center|thumb|500x500px|Mechanism for hydrogenation of alkynes using FLPs]]The reaction is a syn-hydroboration, and as a result a high cis selectivity is observed. At the final stage of the catalytic cycle the C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub> group is cleaved more easily than an alkyl group, causing catalyst degradation rather than alkane release. The catalytic cycle has three steps:\n\n* Substrate binding (the hydroboration of alkyne)\n* H<sub>2</sub> cleavage with vinylborane, followed by intramolecular protodeborylation of vinyl substituent, recovering N,N-Dimethyl-2-[(pentafluorophenyl)boryl]aniline\n* Release of the cis-alkene\n\n[[File:FLP Alkyne Binding.png|thumb|Binding of terminal alkyne to the FLP catalyst]]\n\nWith internal alkynes, a competitive reaction occurs where the proton bound to the nitrogen can be added to the fluorobenzenes. Therefore, this addition does not proceed that much, the formation of the alkene seems favoured.\n\nBut terminal alkynes do not bind to the boron through a 1,2 insertion as the alkenes, but through an oxidative addition. Thus, the addition of the proton to the alkyne will result in the initial terminal alkyne. Hence this hydrogenation process is not suitable to terminal alkynes and will only give pentafluorobenzene.\n\n=== Borylation ===\nAmine-borane FLPs catalyse the borylation of electron-rich aromatic heterocycles (Scheme 1).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=L\u00e9gar\u00e9|first=Marc A.|last2=Courtmanche|first2=Marc A.|last3=Rochette|first3=\u00c9tienne|last4=Fontaine|first4=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric G.|date=2015-07-30|title=Metal-free catalytic C-H bond activation and borylation of heteroarenes|doi=10.1126/science.aab3591|pmid=26228143|issn=0036-8075|volume=349|issue=6247|journal=Science|pages=513\u2013516|bibcode=2015Sci...349..513L|hdl=20.500.11794/30087}}{{closed access}}</ref> The reaction is driven by release of hydrogen via C-H activation by the FLP.

First, the substrate must be electron rich, exemplified by the absence of a reaction with thiophene, whereas its more electron rich derivatives - methoxythiophene and [[3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene|3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene]] - can undergo a reaction with the amino-borane. Furthermore, substitution of 1-methylpyrrole (which can react) with the strongly electron withdrawing [[Tert-Butyloxycarbonyl protecting group|tertbutyloxycarbonyl]] (Boc) group at the 2-position completely inhibits the reaction. The second requirement is for the absence of basic amine groups in the substrate, which would otherwise form an unwanted adduct. This can be illustrated by the lack of a reaction with pyrrole, whereas both 1-methyl and N-benzylpyrrole derivatives are able to react.\n\nFurther work by the same authors revealed that simply piperidine as the amine R group (as opposed to tetramethylpiperidine, pictured above) accelerated the rate of reaction.

Miller]] and starring [[Christopher Reeve]] and [[Rosanna Arquette]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nEdgar Anscombe ([[Christopher Reeve]]) is an instructor at a [[US Army Air Corps]] flying school in 1918. While he is teaching a young pilot, the aircraft crashes during a landing attempt and bursts into flames. The student is killed, though Edgar survives.\n\nTen years later, Edgar is a Contract Air Mail pilot flying the rugged CAM-5 route between [[Elko, Nevada]] and [[Pasco, Washington]]. When asked to take a passenger, Edgar reluctantly agrees, revealing that the last time he had a passenger in his aircraft, it was the doomed trainee.\n\nTillie Hansen ([[Rosanna Arquette]]) is outspoken and rebellious. She makes it clear that she does not want to go to her aunt's house, but her father demands it. He uses his influence as banker for the airline to secure passage for her. Tillie annoys Edgar with her questions, and he acts coldly towards her.\n\nDuring the stopover at [[Boise, Idaho]], Edgar's pilot friend, Jerry Stiller ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) changes the oil lines on the engine, but neglects to inspect his work as a call has just come in for him. The tension between Edgar and Tillie continues to escalate, and when the flight resumes, Edgar decides to take a shortcut over the mountains, deviating from the normal route. However, the engine loses oil pressure and soon fails, causing Edgar to crash land on a remote ridge.\n\nTillie blames Edgar for stranding them, and Edgar calls Tillie a [[jinx]]. During the night, Tillie accidentally blows up the remains of the aircraft with a cigarette. Afterward, Edgar's anger subsides as he seems to accept the hopelessness of their situation.\n\nThe next day, Edgar goes out hunting and manages to shoot a rabbit with his pistol. However, while returning to camp he is attacked by a pack of wolves who steal the rabbit and badly injure his arm. Tillie manages to sew the wound shut and bandages his arm. Faced with the continued threat of the wolves, and since the remains of the aircraft have been destroyed, Edgar and Tillie decide to climb down the cliff to the canyon below.\n\nDuring their descent, a search aircraft flies overhead. Edgar and Tillie jump on a ledge to try to signal the aircraft, but Tillie falls and breaks her leg. The two are forced to spend the night on the cliff face, and a mutual affection develops. The next day, Edgar carries Tillie to the canyon floor, where he makes a [[travois]] to haul her.\n\nWhen Tillie spots some telephone lines, Edgar heads off to investigate, leaving Tillie his revolver. Meanwhile, one of the search pilots has determined the location of the crash, and flies toward the crash site. As Edgar returns to the clearing where he has left Tillie, he is again attacked by a wolf, within sight of Tillie. The rescuers fly overhead and spot Edgar, but are powerless to help. Tillie manages to crawl out of her travois and shoots the wolf, saving Edgar's life. They are rescued, with hints of a romantic relationship developing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Christopher Reeve]] as Edgar Anscombe \n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Tillie Hansen \n* [[Jack Warden]] as Moravia \n* [[Sam Wanamaker]] as Bruno Hansen \n* [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as Jerry Stiller \n* [[Tyne Daly]] as Evelyn Stiller \n* [[Marcia Strassman]] as Rose Stiller \n* [[Will Hare]] as Old Man \n* Robert Pierce as Student Pilot \n* Glenn Neufeld as George Hansen \n* [[Frano Lasi\u0107]] as Daniel Hansen \n* Ron Travis as Probosky \n* [[Jeff Harding (actor)|Jeff Harding]] as Carson \n* Paul Reid Roman as Counterman \n* Paul Lichtman as Customer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe story of the film was adapted by [[Marc Norman]] from the book ''The Aviator'', written by [[Ernest K.

Also she is critically injured after the crash of the Stearman mailplane and is immobile the entire time afterward.\n\nAlthough set in the northwestern [[United States]], the film was actually shot in [[Croatia]] near [[Rijeka]], and Lubiana, [[Slovenia]], then a part of [[Yugoslavia]].\n\n==Reception==\nAviation film historian Stephen Pendo noted that aviation films such as ''The Aviator'' had a difficult time. The last major feature, ''[[Blaze of Noon]]'' (1947), also adapted from a Gann novel, that explored the air mail period was mildly successful. \"While many aspects of aviation have continued to interest filmmakers years after the events have passed, the glamor of flying the mail faded quickly ...\" and so did interest in this film, concluded Pendo.<ref>Pendo 1985, p. 69.</ref> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]]'s review was succinct, \"Dull Ernest Gann story barely made it (and understandably so) to theaters.\"<ref>Maltin 2009, p. 71.</ref> Famed Chicago critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert slammed the film, and when they brought it on their TV show ''[[At the Movies (1982 TV program)|At the Movies]]'', they included the film as a \"stinker\" of the week- a rare title reserved for only films they considered awful. Ebert saying that \"the film takes all the basic cliches from 2 totally different genres and combine them to make one remarkably and almost transcendentally silly movie- it doesn't contain a single ounce of thought\" and Siskel noting that \"there isn't a single scene in this movie that is good. Not one. It is uniformly awful and boring.\"<ref>http://siskelandebert.org/video/263ODYOY63WW/Mask--Sylvester--The-Aviator-1985</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Airmails of the United States]], which describes the Contract Air Mail service and specifically the CAM-5 route which provides the setting for the film\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Maltin, Leonard.

Miller]] and starring [[Christopher Reeve]] and [[Rosanna Arquette]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nEdgar Anscombe ([[Christopher Reeve]]) is an instructor at a [[US Army Air Corps]] flying school in 1918. While he is teaching a young pilot, the aircraft crashes during a landing attempt and bursts into flames. The student is killed, though Edgar survives.\n\nTen years later, Edgar is a Contract Air Mail pilot flying the rugged CAM-5 route between [[Elko, Nevada]] and [[Pasco, Washington]]. When asked to take a passenger, Edgar reluctantly agrees, revealing that the last time he had a passenger in his aircraft, it was the doomed trainee.\n\nTillie Hansen ([[Rosanna Arquette]]) is outspoken and rebellious. She makes it clear that she does not want to go to her aunt's house, but her father demands it. He uses his influence as banker for the airline to secure passage for her. Tillie annoys Edgar with her questions, and he acts coldly towards her.\n\nDuring the stopover at [[Boise, Idaho]], Edgar's pilot friend, Jerry Stiller ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) changes the oil lines on the engine, but neglects to inspect his work as a call has just come in for him. The tension between Edgar and Tillie continues to escalate, and when the flight resumes, Edgar decides to take a shortcut over the mountains, deviating from the normal route. However, the engine loses oil pressure and soon fails, causing Edgar to crash land on a remote ridge.\n\nTillie blames Edgar for stranding them, and Edgar calls Tillie a [[jinx]]. During the night, Tillie accidentally blows up the remains of the aircraft with a cigarette. Afterward, Edgar's anger subsides as he seems to accept the hopelessness of their situation.\n\nThe next day, Edgar goes out hunting and manages to shoot a rabbit with his pistol. However, while returning to camp he is attacked by a pack of wolves who steal the rabbit and badly injure his arm. Tillie manages to sew the wound shut and bandages his arm. Faced with the continued threat of the wolves, and since the remains of the aircraft have been destroyed, Edgar and Tillie decide to climb down the cliff to the canyon below.\n\nDuring their descent, a search aircraft flies overhead. Edgar and Tillie jump on a ledge to try to signal the aircraft, but Tillie falls and breaks her leg. The two are forced to spend the night on the cliff face, and a mutual affection develops. The next day, Edgar carries Tillie to the canyon floor, where he makes a [[travois]] to haul her.\n\nWhen Tillie spots some telephone lines, Edgar heads off to investigate, leaving Tillie his revolver. Meanwhile, one of the search pilots has determined the location of the crash, and flies toward the crash site. As Edgar returns to the clearing where he has left Tillie, he is again attacked by a wolf, within sight of Tillie. The rescuers fly overhead and spot Edgar, but are powerless to help. Tillie manages to crawl out of her travois and shoots the wolf, saving Edgar's life. They are rescued, with hints of a romantic relationship developing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Christopher Reeve]] as Edgar Anscombe \n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Tillie Hansen \n* [[Jack Warden]] as Moravia \n* [[Sam Wanamaker]] as Bruno Hansen \n* [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as Jerry Stiller \n* [[Tyne Daly]] as Evelyn Stiller \n* [[Marcia Strassman]] as Rose Stiller \n* [[Will Hare]] as Old Man \n* Robert Pierce as Student Pilot \n* Glenn Neufeld as George Hansen \n* [[Frano Lasi\u0107]] as Daniel Hansen \n* Ron Travis as Probosky \n* [[Jeff Harding (actor)|Jeff Harding]] as Carson \n* Paul Reid Roman as Counterman \n* Paul Lichtman as Customer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe story of the film was adapted by [[Marc Norman]] from the book ''The Aviator'', written by [[Ernest K. Gann]].<ref>Santoir, Christian. [http://www.aeromovies.fr/articles.php?lng=en&pg=1168 \"Ernest K. Gann: An adventurer from the sky and the sea (1910-1991).\"] ''Aeromovies''. Retrieved: July 18, 2015.</ref> In the book,  Tillie is an 11-year-old girl rather than the pert teenager in the film. Also she is critically injured after the crash of the Stearman mailplane and is immobile the entire time afterward.\n\nAlthough set in the northwestern [[United States]], the film was actually shot in [[Croatia]] near [[Rijeka]], and Lubiana, [[Slovenia]], then a part of [[Yugoslavia]].\n\n==Reception==\nAviation film historian Stephen Pendo noted that aviation films such as ''The Aviator'' had a difficult time. The last major feature, ''[[Blaze of Noon]]'' (1947), also adapted from a Gann novel, that explored the air mail period was mildly successful. \"While many aspects of aviation have continued to interest filmmakers years after the events have passed, the glamor of flying the mail faded quickly ...\" and so did interest in this film, concluded Pendo.<ref>Pendo 1985, p. 69.</ref> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]]'s review was succinct, \"Dull Ernest Gann story barely made it (and understandably so) to theaters.\"<ref>Maltin 2009, p. 71.</ref> Famed Chicago critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert slammed the film, and when they brought it on their TV show ''[[At the Movies (1982 TV program)|At the Movies]]'', they included the film as a \"stinker\" of the week- a rare title reserved for only films they considered awful. Ebert saying that \"the film takes all the basic cliches from 2 totally different genres and combine them to make one remarkably and almost transcendentally silly movie- it doesn't contain a single ounce of thought\" and Siskel noting that \"there isn't a single scene in this movie that is good. Not one. It is uniformly awful and boring.\"<ref>http://siskelandebert.org/video/263ODYOY63WW/Mask--Sylvester--The-Aviator-1985</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Airmails of the United States]], which describes the Contract Air Mail service and specifically the CAM-5 route which provides the setting for the film\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Maltin, Leonard.
