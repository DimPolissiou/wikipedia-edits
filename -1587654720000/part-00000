Lee]], who would later become the commander of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate army]], surveyed the area. They recommended Mullet and [[Egmont Key]]s become fortified as appropriate site for coastal defense installations.  Both keys could only be reached by boat since they were islands off the mainland. Although no fortifications had yet been built, [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops were stationed on the two keys during the Civil War (1861\u20131865) to aid in the Union blockade of [[Tampa Bay]], with the [[Egmont Key Light|Egmont Key lighthouse]] acting as an observation tower. The keys were again abandoned by the military until 1882 when military reservations were officially created on the two keys. However, it would be several years before actual permanent construction would commence as a result of defense considerations linked to the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].<ref name=historic />\n\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto - 12-inch steel coastal defense mortars.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Two of Fort De Soto's remaining four 12-inch coastal defense [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]] of Battery Laidley.

It became known as Mullet Key Quarantine Station. The [[Marine Hospital Service]] took over jurisdiction of the station in 1901. The duty of the station was to inspect aliens aboard ships arriving from foreign ports. By 1925 the station operated with fifteen buildings. The quarantine station operated until 1937, when the [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]] transferred its operations there to Gadsden Point, near [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].\n\nThe main operation on Mullet Key, however, became Fort De Soto in 1900, named for Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. The Army post was officially a subpost of [[Egmont Key State Park|Fort Dade]], which was constructed on Egmont Key. These posts were to contain batteries of artillery and mortars to protect Tampa Bay from any invading forces. Construction of Fort De Soto began in November 1898 and completed in 1906. The foundation was constructed of a seashell concrete formula, and the walls and ceiling used a seashell, stone, and concrete mix. The main attractions at the completed post were the [[artillery battery|artillery]] and [[12-inch coast defense mortar]] batteries, Batteries Laidley and Bigelow. The post consisted of 29 buildings. The post's features included a large [[barracks]], a hospital, a [[guardhouse]], a [[blacksmith]] and carpenter shop, an administration building, and [[mess hall]] with kitchen, a bakery, and a storehouse. The site also had brick roads, concrete sidewalks, and a narrow-gauge railroad to aid in moving materials and supplies around the post.\n\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto - 40 caliber gun 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|One of Fort De Soto Park's two 6-inch 40-caliber rapid-fire Armstrong guns. Originally located at Fort Dade on Egmont Key, the guns were refurbished and remounted for display at Fort De Soto in 1980.<ref name=historic />]]\n\nThe post was active from 1898 to 1910. At least one company was present at Fort De Soto at all times and many times several units were present. [[Mosquito]]es were a constant problem and the post was very hot in the summers.\n\nIn 1910 most troops were moved to [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]] in Alabama. Only a caretaker force remained. By 1914 only an [[ordnance sergeant]] and [[game warden]] remained at the post. Through most of [[World War I]] a larger [[Caretaker (military)|caretaker]] force was at the post, usually with about twenty-two privates, two [[noncommissioned officer]]s, and two [[commissioned officer]]s. In 1917 four of the post's mortars were disassembled and shipped to [[Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery|Fort Rosecrans]] in [[San Diego, California]].\n\nIn November 1922 the Army announced it would soon close both Forts De Soto and Dade. On May 25, 1923, the forts were officially abandoned, and only one caretaker remained at each post. A number of tropical storms and hurricanes severely damaged the buildings on the post. A few were destroyed, as was Battery Bigelow in 1932. The Army attempted to sell the post, but there was little interest. In September 1938 Pinellas County bought the areas on Mullet Key for $12,500.\n\n===Conversion to civilian use===\nShortly after Pinellas County purchased Mullet Key from the federal government in 1938, county commissioners granted a lease to Percy L. Roberts for the use of land and buildings on the island the Mullet Key Quarantine Service had once used. The ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' reported the Commission's action in its January 25, 1939, edition:\n\n<blockquote>Lease of Mullet Key buildings to Percy Roberts was ratified Monday by county commissioners who made no change in the tentative lease approved last week.{{parabr}}Roberts will pay the county $50 a month for the first year and $100 a month for the next two years for the lease of two buildings on the extreme south end of the county's property on the key.{{parabr}}The lessee will operate a daily boat service to the island and will serve fish dinners and rent fishing tackle. The distance from his dock near the Bee Line ferry will be 10 miles. He will land in a sheltered cove on the north end of the island. Trips will be started in about three weeks.<ref>Staff (January 24, 1939) ''[[St. Petersburg Times]] p.7</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto - observation tower.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The remains of an observation tower]]\n[[File:Fort De Soto Park (8434900370).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Birds nesting at the top of the tower]]\n\nRoberts, a native of St. Petersburg and local plumbing contractor, had a simple business plan. First, run a passenger boat to Mullet Key facilitating access to the isolated island. This service was expected to attract both fishermen and sightseers. For the fishermen, easy access to the pristine fishing waters of lower Tampa Bay; for the sightseers, easy access to the ruins of historic Fort De Soto and the white-sand beaches facing the Gulf of Mexico. Secondly, establish a hotel and restaurant on the island. Roberts envisioned creating a venue on the island appealing to clubs, associations, and other organizations for group outings of members for fishing, sightseeing, and \"dining on fried mullet\".\n\nWith lease in hand and business plan formulated, and with the financial support of Charles R. Carter, a local insurance executive and president of the Bee Line Ferry Co., Roberts immediately began implementing his plan.\n\nFor transportation to the isolated island, the passenger boat Hobo was put into service. Hobo operated daily from the Bee Line Ferry Terminal at St. Petersburg's Pinellas Point, pulling away from the dock early morning and leaving for the return trip late afternoon. Hobo was also available for chartered trips in between scheduled runs. \"By boat\" was not the only means of transportation to the island. A strip of land on the island was cleared in response to requests by some who wanted to fly small aircraft in and out.\n\nLodging and eating accommodations on the island were fashioned by renovating a building vacated by the Quarantine Service in 1937. The facility at best was austere, but one who was tired and hungry could get a good night's sleep; plenty of coffee, a hearty serving of bacon and eggs for breakfast; any of an assortment of sandwiches for lunch; and, a family style meal of fried mullet with all the trimmings for supper. A screened-in porch was there for those who just wanted to lean back, prop up the feet, enjoy a cool beverage, and relax. This facility became known familiarly as Mullet Key Lodge.\n\nRubert \"Rube\" Allyn, a writer for the ''St. Petersburg Times'', included in his March 28, 1939, column, \"Along the Waterfront\":\n\n<blockquote>When the Pinellas county commissioners leased the old Fort De Soto, and Mullet Key to Percy Roberts, they did a fine thing for the tourists by opening up the vast uninhabited reaches of Mullet Key and the old fort to exploration parties ... Today for a nominal fee, one can take a boat at Pinellas Point, and go to Mullet Key, land at the old Quarantine dock, enjoy an old-fashioned fish dinner prepared in the same manner as the pioneers of 50 years ago, by the Roberts family, and explore miles of uninhabited beaches, bayous, and the old Spanish\u2013American War fort ...<ref>Allyn, Rubert (March 28, 1939) \"Along the Waterfront\" ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Bombing range===\nIn less than two years, Mullet Key Lodge became well established and profitable. However, this first for-profit business founded on the island was short-lived. The lease, granted to Roberts in 1939, had to be rescinded because the War Department decided it wanted the island back for use as a [[bombing range]] by the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] in support of air bases then being constructed in the Tampa Bay area. That pending transaction was reported by the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' on December 18, 1940:\n\n<blockquote>Mullet Key purchased by the county from the Treasury department in 1938 for $12,500 will soon be taken over by the United States Army Air Corps for use as a bombing range. The Air Corps will pay the county all that has been expended to date and will pay to Capt. Charles R. Carter all he has expended in improving the building into a fishing lodge. It is understood that Capt. Carter has an investment of about $8,000 while the county\u2019s total investment is about $13,800.<ref>Staff (December 18, 1940) ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' p.2</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1941, the federal government bought back Mullet Key from Pinellas County for $18,404. As planned, It was turned into a sub-post of [[MacDill AFB|MacDill Field]] and used as a bombing range throughout World War II.\n\n===County park===\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto - Gulf Pier 2.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The Gulf Pier at Fort De Soto Park, one of two fishing piers.]]\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto side bike path.jpg|thumb|275px|The bike path leading to Arrowhead Fishing and Camping Area.]]\n\nAfter World War II, the by then-renamed [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] had no need for Mullet Key, and it was a sold back to Pinellas County along with adjacent islands Sister Key, Hospital Key, Rattlesnake Key, and Scratch Key. The sale, for $26,495.54, was finalized in 1948. County officials immediately designated Fort De Soto and all of Mullet Key a county recreational area and declared it open to the public. Soon thereafter excursion passenger boats began regularly scheduled trips to the island.\n\nIn 1962, a toll road, the [[Pinellas Bayway]] (formerly [[State Road A19A (Florida)|State Road A19A]], now [[State Road 682 (Florida)|SR 682]]), was completed to the mainland, enabling island visitors to arrive by car. On December 21, 1962, Fort De Soto Park opened. On May 11, 1963, Fort De Soto Park was officially dedicated. Its facilities have been expanded over the years. The quartermaster storehouse was reconstructed to become the Quartermaster Storehouse Museum. On December 2, 1977, the Fort De Soto batteries were placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The four [[12-inch coast defense mortar|12-inch M1890 mortars]] and two [[QF 6 inch /40 naval gun#US service|6-inch Armstrong guns]] at Fort De Soto are the only weapons of their type remaining in the United States.\n\n==Recreational activities and amenities==\nThe park is open year-round and has the following features:\n* Several thousand acres of firm-bottomed shallows, making the area a favored destination of wading anglers\n* Two piers, each allowing fishing. Both have bait, tackle and food concessions.\n* Various picnic areas.\n* Fort De Soto, built in 1898, abandoned in phases 1910 to 1948.\n* [[Quartermaster]] Storehouse Museum.\n* Two swimming areas, North Beach and East Beach.

[[Mosquito]]es were a constant problem and the post was very hot in the summers.\n\nIn 1910 most troops were moved to [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]] in Alabama. Only a caretaker force remained. By 1914 only an [[ordnance sergeant]] and [[game warden]] remained at the post. Through most of [[World War I]] a larger [[Caretaker (military)|caretaker]] force was at the post, usually with about twenty-two privates, two [[noncommissioned officer]]s, and two [[commissioned officer]]s. In 1917 four of the post's mortars were disassembled and shipped to [[Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery|Fort Rosecrans]] in [[San Diego, California]].\n\nIn November 1922 the Army announced it would soon close both Forts De Soto and Dade. On May 25, 1923, the forts were officially abandoned, and only one caretaker remained at each post. A number of tropical storms and hurricanes severely damaged the buildings on the post. A few were destroyed, as was Battery Bigelow in 1932. The Army attempted to sell the post, but there was little interest. In September 1938 Pinellas County bought the areas on Mullet Key for $12,500.\n\n===Conversion to civilian use===\nShortly after Pinellas County purchased Mullet Key from the federal government in 1938, county commissioners granted a lease to Percy L. Roberts for the use of land and buildings on the island the Mullet Key Quarantine Service had once used. The ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' reported the Commission's action in its January 25, 1939, edition:\n\n<blockquote>Lease of Mullet Key buildings to Percy Roberts was ratified Monday by county commissioners who made no change in the tentative lease approved last week.{{parabr}}Roberts will pay the county $50 a month for the first year and $100 a month for the next two years for the lease of two buildings on the extreme south end of the county's property on the key.{{parabr}}The lessee will operate a daily boat service to the island and will serve fish dinners and rent fishing tackle. The distance from his dock near the Bee Line ferry will be 10 miles. He will land in a sheltered cove on the north end of the island. Trips will be started in about three weeks.<ref>Staff (January 24, 1939) ''[[St. Petersburg Times]] p.7</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto - observation tower.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The remains of an observation tower]]\n[[File:Fort De Soto Park (8434900370).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Birds nesting at the top of the tower]]\n\nRoberts, a native of St. Petersburg and local plumbing contractor, had a simple business plan. First, run a passenger boat to Mullet Key facilitating access to the isolated island. This service was expected to attract both fishermen and sightseers. For the fishermen, easy access to the pristine fishing waters of lower Tampa Bay; for the sightseers, easy access to the ruins of historic Fort De Soto and the white-sand beaches facing the Gulf of Mexico. Secondly, establish a hotel and restaurant on the island. Roberts envisioned creating a venue on the island appealing to clubs, associations, and other organizations for group outings of members for fishing, sightseeing, and \"dining on fried mullet\".\n\nWith lease in hand and business plan formulated, and with the financial support of Charles R. Carter, a local insurance executive and president of the Bee Line Ferry Co., Roberts immediately began implementing his plan.\n\nFor transportation to the isolated island, the passenger boat Hobo was put into service. Hobo operated daily from the Bee Line Ferry Terminal at St. Petersburg's Pinellas Point, pulling away from the dock early morning and leaving for the return trip late afternoon. Hobo was also available for chartered trips in between scheduled runs. \"By boat\" was not the only means of transportation to the island. A strip of land on the island was cleared in response to requests by some who wanted to fly small aircraft in and out.\n\nLodging and eating accommodations on the island were fashioned by renovating a building vacated by the Quarantine Service in 1937. The facility at best was austere, but one who was tired and hungry could get a good night's sleep; plenty of coffee, a hearty serving of bacon and eggs for breakfast; any of an assortment of sandwiches for lunch; and, a family style meal of fried mullet with all the trimmings for supper. A screened-in porch was there for those who just wanted to lean back, prop up the feet, enjoy a cool beverage, and relax. This facility became known familiarly as Mullet Key Lodge.\n\nRubert \"Rube\" Allyn, a writer for the ''St. Petersburg Times'', included in his March 28, 1939, column, \"Along the Waterfront\":\n\n<blockquote>When the Pinellas county commissioners leased the old Fort De Soto, and Mullet Key to Percy Roberts, they did a fine thing for the tourists by opening up the vast uninhabited reaches of Mullet Key and the old fort to exploration parties ... Today for a nominal fee, one can take a boat at Pinellas Point, and go to Mullet Key, land at the old Quarantine dock, enjoy an old-fashioned fish dinner prepared in the same manner as the pioneers of 50 years ago, by the Roberts family, and explore miles of uninhabited beaches, bayous, and the old Spanish\u2013American War fort ...<ref>Allyn, Rubert (March 28, 1939) \"Along the Waterfront\" ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Bombing range===\nIn less than two years, Mullet Key Lodge became well established and profitable. However, this first for-profit business founded on the island was short-lived. The lease, granted to Roberts in 1939, had to be rescinded because the War Department decided it wanted the island back for use as a [[bombing range]] by the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] in support of air bases then being constructed in the Tampa Bay area. That pending transaction was reported by the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' on December 18, 1940:\n\n<blockquote>Mullet Key purchased by the county from the Treasury department in 1938 for $12,500 will soon be taken over by the United States Army Air Corps for use as a bombing range. The Air Corps will pay the county all that has been expended to date and will pay to Capt. Charles R. Carter all he has expended in improving the building into a fishing lodge. It is understood that Capt. Carter has an investment of about $8,000 while the county\u2019s total investment is about $13,800.<ref>Staff (December 18, 1940) ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' p.2</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1941, the federal government bought back Mullet Key from Pinellas County for $18,404. As planned, It was turned into a sub-post of [[MacDill AFB|MacDill Field]] and used as a bombing range throughout World War II.\n\n===County park===\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto - Gulf Pier 2.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The Gulf Pier at Fort De Soto Park, one of two fishing piers.]]\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto side bike path.jpg|thumb|275px|The bike path leading to Arrowhead Fishing and Camping Area.]]\n\nAfter World War II, the by then-renamed [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] had no need for Mullet Key, and it was a sold back to Pinellas County along with adjacent islands Sister Key, Hospital Key, Rattlesnake Key, and Scratch Key. The sale, for $26,495.54, was finalized in 1948. County officials immediately designated Fort De Soto and all of Mullet Key a county recreational area and declared it open to the public. Soon thereafter excursion passenger boats began regularly scheduled trips to the island.\n\nIn 1962, a toll road, the [[Pinellas Bayway]] (formerly [[State Road A19A (Florida)|State Road A19A]], now [[State Road 682 (Florida)|SR 682]]), was completed to the mainland, enabling island visitors to arrive by car. On December 21, 1962, Fort De Soto Park opened. On May 11, 1963, Fort De Soto Park was officially dedicated. Its facilities have been expanded over the years. The quartermaster storehouse was reconstructed to become the Quartermaster Storehouse Museum. On December 2, 1977, the Fort De Soto batteries were placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The four [[12-inch coast defense mortar|12-inch M1890 mortars]] and two [[QF 6 inch /40 naval gun#US service|6-inch Armstrong guns]] at Fort De Soto are the only weapons of their type remaining in the United States.\n\n==Recreational activities and amenities==\nThe park is open year-round and has the following features:\n* Several thousand acres of firm-bottomed shallows, making the area a favored destination of wading anglers\n* Two piers, each allowing fishing. Both have bait, tackle and food concessions.\n* Various picnic areas.\n* Fort De Soto, built in 1898, abandoned in phases 1910 to 1948.\n* [[Quartermaster]] Storehouse Museum.\n* Two swimming areas, North Beach and East Beach.

Starting in about 1920 Stalin gave a birth date of {{OldStyleDate|21 December|1879|9}}, despite being born on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6}}</ref> \u2013 5 March 1953) was a Georgian revolutionary and Soviet politician who led the [[Soviet Union]] from the mid-1920s until 1953 as the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (1922\u20131952) and [[premier of the Soviet Union]] (1941\u20131953). Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a [[Collective leadership in the Soviet Union|collective leadership]], he eventually consolidated power to become the country's ''de facto'' [[dictator]] by the 1930s. A [[communist]] ideologically committed to the [[Leninist]] interpretation of [[Marxism]], Stalin formalised these ideas as [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], while his own policies are known as [[Stalinism]].\n\n<!--Early life, revolutionary activity and rise to power-->\nBorn to a poor family in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), Stalin joined the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, ''[[Pravda]]'', and raised funds for [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolshevik]] faction via robberies, kidnappings, and [[protection rackets]]. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]] and created a [[one-party state]] under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Serving in the [[Russian Civil War]] before overseeing [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|the Soviet Union's establishment]] in 1922, Stalin [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|assumed leadership over the country]] following [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's 1924 death]]. Under Stalin, \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" became a central tenet of the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|party's dogma]]. Through the [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]], the country underwent [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|agricultural collectivisation]] and [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|rapid industrialisation]], creating a centralised [[command economy]]. This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1932\u201333]]. To eradicate accused \"[[enemies of the working class]]\", Stalin instituted the \"[[Great Purge]]\", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state.\n\n<!--Governance in the latter part of the 1930s through to his death-->\nStalin's government promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the [[Communist International]] and supported European [[anti-fascist]] movements during the 1930s, particularly in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1939, it signed a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]], resulting in the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]. Germany ended the pact by [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]] in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet [[Red Army]] repelled the German incursion and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in 1945, ending [[World War II]] in Europe. The Soviets [[Occupation of the Baltic states|annexed the Baltic states]] and helped establish [[Soviet sphere of influence|Soviet-aligned governments]] throughout [[Central and Eastern Europe]], [[Chinese Civil War|China]], and [[Soviet Civil Administration|North Korea]]. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as global [[superpower]]s. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed [[Eastern Bloc]] and U.S.-backed [[Western Bloc]] which became known as the [[Cold War]]. Stalin led his country through the post-war reconstruction, during which it [[Soviet atomic bomb project|developed a nuclear weapon]] in 1949. In these years, the country experienced [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|another major famine]] and an [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|anti-semitic]] campaign peaking in the [[doctors' plot]]. After [[Stalin's death]] in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|denounced him]] and initiated the [[de-Stalinisation]] of [[Soviet society]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive [[Stalin's cult of personality|personality cult]] within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and [[socialism]]. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his [[totalitarian]] government has been widely condemned for overseeing [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|mass repressions]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]], hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines [[Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin|that killed millions]].\n<!--please do not remove, for ToC spacing-->\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Joseph Stalin}}\n\n===Childhood to young adulthood: 1878\u20131899===\nStalin was born in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] town of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]],{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=11}} then part of the [[Tiflis Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] and home to a mix of Georgian, Armenian, Russian, and Jewish communities.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=15}} He was born on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6 Dec}},{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=23}}{{efn|Although there is an inconsistency among published sources about Stalin's exact date of birth, Ioseb Jughashvili is found in the records of the Uspensky Church in Gori, Georgia as born on 18 December ([[Julian calendar|Old Style]]: 6 December) 1878.

argued that while Stalin initially ruled as part of a Communist Party [[oligarchy]], in 1934 the Soviet government transformed from this oligarchy into a personal dictatorship,{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=124}} with Stalin only becoming \"absolute dictator\" between March and June 1937, when senior military and NKVD figures were

Lenin's ideas by deviating from them.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=5}} The socio-economic nature of Stalin's Soviet Union has also been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of [[state socialism]], [[state capitalism]], [[bureaucratic collectivism]], or a totally unique mode of production.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=265\u2013266}} Socialist writers like Volkogonov have acknowledged that Stalin's

Starting in about 1920 Stalin gave a birth date of {{OldStyleDate|21 December|1879|9}}, despite being born on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6}}</ref> \u2013 5 March 1953) was a Georgian revolutionary and Soviet politician who led the [[Soviet Union]] from the mid-1920s until 1953 as the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (1922\u20131952) and [[premier of the Soviet Union]] (1941\u20131953). Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a [[Collective leadership in the Soviet Union|collective leadership]], he eventually consolidated power to become the country's ''de facto'' [[dictator]] by the 1930s. A [[communist]] ideologically committed to the [[Leninist]] interpretation of [[Marxism]], Stalin formalised these ideas as [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], while his own policies are known as [[Stalinism]].\n\n<!--Early life, revolutionary activity and rise to power-->\nBorn to a poor family in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), Stalin joined the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, ''[[Pravda]]'', and raised funds for [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolshevik]] faction via robberies, kidnappings, and [[protection rackets]]. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]] and created a [[one-party state]] under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Serving in the [[Russian Civil War]] before overseeing [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|the Soviet Union's establishment]] in 1922, Stalin [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|assumed leadership over the country]] following [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's 1924 death]]. Under Stalin, \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" became a central tenet of the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|party's dogma]]. Through the [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]], the country underwent [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|agricultural collectivisation]] and [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|rapid industrialisation]], creating a centralised [[command economy]]. This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1932\u201333]]. To eradicate accused \"[[enemies of the working class]]\", Stalin instituted the \"[[Great Purge]]\", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state.\n\n<!--Governance in the latter part of the 1930s through to his death-->\nStalin's government promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the [[Communist International]] and supported European [[anti-fascist]] movements during the 1930s, particularly in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1939, it signed a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]], resulting in the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]. Germany ended the pact by [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]] in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet [[Red Army]] repelled the German incursion and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in 1945, ending [[World War II]] in Europe. The Soviets [[Occupation of the Baltic states|annexed the Baltic states]] and helped establish [[Soviet sphere of influence|Soviet-aligned governments]] throughout [[Central and Eastern Europe]], [[Chinese Civil War|China]], and [[Soviet Civil Administration|North Korea]]. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as global [[superpower]]s. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed [[Eastern Bloc]] and U.S.-backed [[Western Bloc]] which became known as the [[Cold War]]. Stalin led his country through the post-war reconstruction, during which it [[Soviet atomic bomb project|developed a nuclear weapon]] in 1949. In these years, the country experienced [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|another major famine]] and an [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|anti-semitic]] campaign peaking in the [[doctors' plot]]. After [[Stalin's death]] in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|denounced him]] and initiated the [[de-Stalinisation]] of [[Soviet society]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive [[Stalin's cult of personality|personality cult]] within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and [[socialism]]. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his [[totalitarian]] government has been widely condemned for overseeing [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|mass repressions]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]], hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines [[Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin|that killed millions]].\n<!--please do not remove, for ToC spacing-->\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Joseph Stalin}}\n\n===Childhood to young adulthood: 1878\u20131899===\nStalin was born in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] town of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]],{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=11}} then part of the [[Tiflis Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] and home to a mix of Georgian, Armenian, Russian, and Jewish communities.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=15}} He was born on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6 Dec}},{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=23}}{{efn|Although there is an inconsistency among published sources about Stalin's exact date of birth, Ioseb Jughashvili is found in the records of the Uspensky Church in Gori, Georgia as born on 18 December ([[Julian calendar|Old Style]]: 6 December) 1878.

argued that while Stalin initially ruled as part of a Communist Party [[oligarchy]], in 1934 the Soviet government transformed from this oligarchy into a personal dictatorship,{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=124}} with Stalin only becoming \"absolute dictator\" between March and June 1937, when senior military and NKVD figures were

Lenin's ideas by deviating from them.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=5}} The socio-economic nature of Stalin's Soviet Union has also been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of [[state socialism]], [[state capitalism]], [[bureaucratic collectivism]], or a totally unique mode of production.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=265\u2013266}} Socialist writers like Volkogonov have acknowledged that Stalin's

Most were [[coastal defence and fortification|coastal forts]].\n\nThey stand up to {{convert|40|ft|m}} high (with two floors) and typically had a garrison of one officer and 15\u201325 men. Their round structure and thick walls of solid masonry made them resistant to cannon fire, while their height made them an ideal platform for a single heavy [[artillery]] piece, mounted on the flat roof and able to traverse, and hence fire, over a complete 360\u00b0 circle. A few towers had moats or other batteries and works attached for extra defence.\n\nThe Martello towers were used during the first half of the 19th century, but became obsolete with the introduction of powerful [[rifled]] artillery. Many have survived to the present day, often preserved as historic monuments.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, during the premiership of [[Lord Palmerston]], there was another spate of tower and fort building. The [[Palmerston Forts]] are also circular in design and resemble Martello towers.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Tour de la Mortella.jpg|thumb|left|The resistance of the [[Torra di Mortella]] to the British in 1794 inspired Martello towers]]\nMartello towers were inspired by a round fortress, part of a larger [[Genoa|Genoese]] defence system, at [[Torra di Mortella|Mortella]] (Myrtle) Point in [[Corsica]]. The designer was [[Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino]] (el Fratin),<ref>Vigano (2001), pp. 41\u201357.</ref> and the tower was completed in 1565.\n\nSince the 15th century, the Corsicans had built similar towers at strategic points around the island to protect coastal villages and shipping from North African [[pirates]]. The towers stood one or two storeys high and measured {{convert|12|\u2013|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, with a single doorway five metres off the ground that one could access only via a ladder that the occupants could remove.<ref name=\"Abram 2003, p. 103\">Abram (2003), p. 103.</ref>\n\nLocal villagers paid for the towers and watchmen, known as ''torregiani'', who would signal the approach of unexpected ships by lighting a beacon fire on the tower's roof. The fire would alert the local defence forces to the threat. Although the pirate threat subsequently dwindled, the Genovese built a newer generation of circular towers (the [[Genoese tower]]s), that warded off later foreign raids.<ref name=\"Abram 2003, p. 103\" />\n\n[[File:Plaines d'Abraham et tour martello.jpg|thumb|A Martello tower on the [[plains of Abraham]] in [[Quebec City]] ([[Quebec]], [[Canada]]), at the top of Cap Diamant overlooking the [[Saint Lawrence River]].]]\nOn 7 February 1794 as part of the [[Siege of San Fiorenzo|siege of Saint-Florent]], two British warships, {{HMS|Fortitude |1780|6}} (74 guns) and {{HMS|Juno|1780|2}} (32 guns), unsuccessfully attacked the tower at Mortella Point; the tower eventually fell to land-based forces under [[John Moore (British soldier)|Sir John Moore]] after two days of heavy fighting. What helped the British was that the tower's two 18-pounder guns fired seaward, while only the one 6-pounder could fire land-ward.\n\nVice-Admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]] reported:\n\n{{quote|...The ''Fortitude'' and ''Juno'' were ordered against it, without making the least impression by a continued cannonade of two hours and a half; and the former ship being very much damaged by red-hot shot, both hauled off. The walls of the Tower were of a prodigious thickness, and the parapet, where there were two eighteen-pounders, was lined with bass junk,{{refn|Bass-junk was a type of cable made of grass.<ref>''The United Service Magazine'', Volume 51, p.301.</ref> The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' reports that \"bass\" is a name \"given elliptically to various articles made of this [fibre] or similar material; e.g. a mat, a hassock, a flat plaited bag or flexible basket.\"|group=Note}} five feet from the walls, and filled up with sand; and although it was cannonaded from the Height for two days, within 150 yards, and appeared in a very shattered state, the enemy still held out; but a few hot shot setting fire to the bass, made them call for quarter. The number of men in the Tower were 33; only two were wounded, and those mortally.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=13631|date=15 March 1794|page=222}}</ref>}}\n\nLate in the previous year, the tower's French defenders had abandoned it after {{HMS|Lowestoffe|1761|6}} (32 guns) had fired two broadsides at it. The British removed the guns to arm a small vessel; consequently, the French were easily able to dislodge the garrison of Corsican patriots that had replaced them.<ref name=Sutcliffe>Sutcliffe (1973).</ref>  Still, the British were impressed by the effectiveness of the tower when properly supplied and defended, and copied the design. But, they got the name wrong, misspelling \"Mortella\" as \"Martello\" (which means \"hammer\" in Italian). When the British withdrew from Corsica in 1803, with great difficulty they blew up the tower, leaving it in an unusable state.<ref name=Sutcliffe />\n\n== Design and construction ==\n[[File:Tour Martello 3 d\u00e9molition.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quebec City|Qu\u00e9bec city]] had four Martello towers, but tower n\u00b03 was demolished in 1904. In this picture, the internal structure can be seen.]]\nThe towers were about {{convert|40|ft|m}} high with walls about {{convert|8|ft|m}} thick. In some towers the rooms were not built in the centre, but more to the landside, leaving the walls thicker on seaside. These were cases where an attack with a cannon from the landside was thought very unlikely. Entry was by ladder to a door about {{convert|10|ft|m}} from the base above which was a machicolated (slotted) platform which allowed for downward fire on attackers. The flat roof or ''terreplein'' had a high parapet and a raised platform in the centre with a pivot (sometimes a converted cannon) for a cannon that would traverse a 360\u00b0 arc. (Some towers were designed to carry more than one gun, with each having a more limited arc of fire.) The walls had narrow slits for defensive musket fire.\n\n[[File:Martello tower diagram EN.svg|thumb|Diagram of the interior of a Martello tower]]\nThe interior of a classic British Martello tower consisted of two storeys (sometimes with an additional basement). The ground floor served as the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] and storerooms, where ammunition, water, stores and provisions were kept. The [[garrison]] of 24 men and one officer lived in a [[casemate]] on the first floor, which was divided into several rooms and had fireplaces built into the walls for cooking and heating.<ref name=\"robert19\">Ciucevich (2005), pp. 19\u201321.</ref> The officer and men lived in separate rooms of almost equal size. A well or cistern within the fort supplied the garrison with water. An internal drainage system linked to the roof enabled rainwater to refill the cistern.<ref name=\"robert19\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n== Martello towers around the world ==\n[[File:Martello towers worldwide map.png|thumb|center|600px|Distribution of Martello towers worldwide]]\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the British government embarked on a large-scale programme of building Martello towers to guard the British and Irish coastlines. Around 140 were built, mostly along the south coast of [[England]]. Governments in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Menorca]], [[South Africa]] and [[Sri Lanka]] also constructed towers. The construction of Martello towers abroad continued until as late as the 1870s but was discontinued after it became clear that they could not withstand the new generation of rifled artillery weapons.\n\nThe French built similar towers along their own coastline that they used as platforms for communication by [[optical telegraph]]s (using the [[Claude Chappe|Chappe Telegraph]]). The [[United States]] government also built a number of Martello towers along the east coast of the US that copied the British design with some modifications.\n\n=== United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ===\n[[File:Portmarnock martello.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[Portmarnock]] Martello tower, one of many on Ireland's east coast]]\nGreat Britain and Ireland were united as a single political entity, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], from 1801 to 1922, spanning the time during which most Martello towers were erected (the initial scheme started under the previous entities of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland]]). Consequently, the Martello towers of Great Britain and Ireland can be considered to have been part of a single defensive system, designed to protect the coastlines of the two main islands of the [[British Isles]] as a whole.<ref>Rooke (1857), p.68.</ref><ref name=Clements>Clements (1998).</ref>\n\nThis is most clearly visible on the south and east coasts of [[England]] and the east coast of [[Ireland]], where chains of Martello towers were built. Elsewhere in the world, individual Martello towers were erected to provide point defence of strategic locations.\n\n==== England ====\n[[File:Martello tower 500.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of a Martello tower]]\nBetween 1804 and 1812 the British authorities built a chain of towers based on the original Mortella tower to [[British anti-invasion preparations of 1803\u20131805|defend the south and east coast of England]], Ireland, [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]] to guard against [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|possible invasion]] from [[France]], then under the rule of the [[Napoleon I of France|Emperor Napoleon]]. A total of 103<ref name=Sutcliffe /> Martello towers were built in England, set at regular intervals along the coast from [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]], [[Sussex]], to [[Aldeburgh]], [[Suffolk]]. Most were constructed under the direction of General [[William Twiss]] (1745\u20131827) and a Captain Ford.<ref>Mead (1948), pp. 205\u201317, 294\u2013303.</ref><ref>Ward (1949), pp. 18\u201337.</ref>  The northern-most tower at Aldeburgh is of quatrefoil design, i.e. four in one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/martello-tower-9317|title=Holiday at Martello Tower in Aldeburgh, Suffolk - The Landmark Trust|website=www.landmarktrust.org.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211003141/http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/martello-tower-9317|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIncluded in the scheme were three much larger circular forts or [[redoubt]]s that were constructed at [[Harwich Redoubt|Harwich]], [[Dymchurch Redoubt|Dymchurch]] and [[Eastbourne Redoubt|Eastbourne]]; they acted as supply depots for the smaller towers as well as being powerful fortifications in their own right.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.martello-towers.co.uk/south-coast/towers/dymchurch-redoubt.htm |title=Dymchurch Redoubt |publisher=Martello-towers.co.uk |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2010-12-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223024147/http://www.martello-towers.co.uk/south-coast/towers/dymchurch-redoubt.htm |archivedate=23 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of Britain's Martello towers was never actually tested in combat against a Napoleonic invasion fleet. They were, however, effective in hindering smuggling.<ref>Daly (2007), p.34.</ref> After the threat had passed, the Martello towers in England met a variety of fates. [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|The Coastguard]] took over many to aid in the fight against smuggling.\n[[File:Martello tower 700.jpg|thumb|A Martello tower at [[Clacton-on-Sea]] on the east coast of England.]]\nFifteen towers were demolished to enable the re-use of their masonry. The sea washed thirty away and the military destroyed four in experiments to test the effectiveness of the new [[rifled]] artillery. During the [[Second World War]], some Martello towers returned to military service as observation platforms and firing platforms for [[anti-aircraft artillery]].\n\nForty-seven Martello towers have survived in England, a few of which have been restored and transformed into museums (e.g., the tower at [[St Osyth and Seaford]]) visitor centres, and galleries (such as [[Jaywick Martello Tower]]).

The most notable surviving towers are the two located in [[Pembroke Dock]], which were built between 1848 and 1857 to protect the naval base there. Today, one of the towers is privately owned. The other is located on the town's riverfront, next to the old entrance of the naval base. It was converted into a small museum that focused on the local history of the dock and its defences. The museum has now shut down because of water influx. Recently Pembrokeshire County Council has decided to put the tower up for sale.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.guntowermuseum.org.uk/index.html| title=Gun Tower Museum| publisher=Pembroke Dock Gun Tower Museum Trust| accessdate=2012-03-10| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305142434/http://www.guntowermuseum.org.uk/index.html| archivedate=5 March 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Ireland ====\n[[File:Martello Tower Balbriggan.jpg|thumb|Martello tower at [[Balbriggan]]]]\nAbout fifty Martello towers were built around the Irish coastline, especially along the east coast, from [[Millmount Fort|Millmount]] (Drogheda), to [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], around [[Dublin Bay]] but also around [[Cork Harbour]] on the south coast. On the east coast, concentrated mainly around Dublin Bay, twenty-six towers were in line of sight of each other, providing the ability to communicate with one another, or warn of any incoming attacks.\n\nPossibly the most famous is the Martello tower in [[Sandycove]], near [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]], in which [[James Joyce]] lived for a few days. Joyce shared the tower with [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]], then a medical student but later to become famous in Irish history as a surgeon, politician and writer. In ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', the fictional character [[Stephen Dedalus]] lives in the tower with a medical student, Malachi \"Buck\" Mulligan, whom Joyce based on Gogarty. The [[James Joyce Tower]], as the tower is now known, houses a museum dedicated to Joyce.\n\nA number of other Martello towers are extant nearby at [[Bullock Harbour]], [[Dalkey Island]], [[Blackrock, Dublin|Williamstown]], [[Seapoint]] and [[Sandymount]] and Martello towers feature in many literary works set in [[Dublin]]. During the 1980s, [[Bono]] owned the Martello tower in [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], [[County Wicklow]].\n\n[[File:Killiney Martello No7.jpg|thumb|left|Martello tower (South No.7) at [[Killiney]]]]\nMartello Tower South No.7, on Tara Hill, Killiney Bay, is unique, as is its location as an [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading tower]].

There is a three-gun battery below the tower, with a [[glacis]]. There is also a coach house, artillery store, tool shed, and gunner's cottage, with resident gunner and [[gunpowder]] store. The battery, while restored, remains to be armed and the coach house and artillery store still require some restoration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.photopol.com/martello/no7.html |title=Tower No. 7 |publisher=Photopol.com |date=2008-07-12 |accessdate=2010-12-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226231516/http://www.photopol.com/martello/no7.html |archivedate=26 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn the north side of Dublin, one can find Martello towers in [[Balbriggan]], [[Shenick Island]] and Red Island at [[Skerries, Dublin|Skerries]], [[Drumanagh|Drumanagh Fort]], [[Rush,_Dublin|Rush]], Tower Bay in [[Portrane]], [[Donabate]], [[Malahide]] (Hicks tower), [[Portmarnock]], [[Ireland's Eye]], [[Howth]], and [[Sutton, Dublin|Sutton]].\n\nThere were seven Martello towers in the vicinity of Cork Harbour of which five are extant.<ref name=\"Society1907\">{{cite book|author=Cn|title=Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wf16AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA198|volume=XIII|year=1907|publisher=Cork Historical and Archaeological Society|pages=198\u2013200|chapter=The Martello Towers of Cork Harbour}}</ref> During the 19th century [[Fenian Rising|Fenian uprising]], the famous [[William Mackey Lomasney|Captain Mackey]] briefly captured and held the Monning Martello tower near [[Fota Island]] in [[Cork Harbour]]; this tower is believed to have been the only Martello tower ever captured, other than the original. The other Cork Harbour towers are at [[Ringaskiddy]], [[Haulbowline Island]] (now part of the Irish Naval Service HQ) and at [[Belvelly]] and [[Rossleague]] on the [[Great Island]] (near [[Cobh]]). There are also Martello towers at [[Little Island, Cork|Little Island]] and [[Rostellan]], though these are no longer intact.\n\nThe British built two Martello towers on the Hook Peninsula to protect the fort near [[Duncannon]], [[Co. Wexford]] and the entrance to [[Waterford]] Harbour. There is a third tower on the headland at Baginbun Bay in Co. Wexford.\n\nOne of the most interesting Martello towers is [[Meelick Martello Tower]] at [[Clonahenoge]], [[County Offaly]], guarding the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] river crossing to [[Meelick, County Galway]]. As this tower supports three guns (unlike the normal Martello tower which is circular on plan and carries only one gun), it is cam shaped on plan.

There is also an extant Martello tower located near the settlement of [[Magilligan|Magilligan Point]] in [[County Londonderry]], built between 1812 and 1871 to defend against a possible French invasion during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; it is now currently used as a visitor attraction. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://discovernorthernireland.com/Magilligan-Martello-Tower-Limavady-P2926/ |title=Magilligan Martello Tower\n |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=discovernorthernireland.com |publisher= Discover Northern Ireland |access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> \n\nA Martello-like tower was built on [[Achill Island]], according to local memory during the Napoleonic Wars. It is square rather than round, unlike the traditional Martello tower. This tower is known locally as the Gabhla Fhranca (\"French Tower\") or the Napoleonic Tower. It is marked on an 1838 [[Ordnance Survey]] chart and denoted \"Signal Tower,\" suggesting it was used with a series of other stations for communication. The tower's position offers a view of the sea both to the north and south of the island and is therefore well-suited for that purpose. By the 1830s the tower was described as a \"watch-house of the coast-guard.\"\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==== Antigua and Barbuda ====\n[[File:Antigua 8 Cent Stamp 1953.jpg|thumb|A 1953 stamp of Antigua showing the Martello Tower in Barbuda.]]\nThe British originally constructed River Fort Martello Tower in the early 19th century, on the site of a previous fort (presumed to have been built by the Spanish) to guard nearby River Landing, which was [[Barbuda]]'s original quay. Confusion with the previous fort is presumably explains the claims made in Barbudian tourism publications that this was the World's first, and is its oldest, Martello tower, built in 1745.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/beautifulbarbudamagazine/docs/beautiful_barbuda_2012|title=Beautiful Barbuda 2012|website=issuu|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809144415/https://issuu.com/beautifulbarbudamagazine/docs/beautiful_barbuda_2012|archivedate=9 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  The tower is located on the south coast of the island, a mile or so from River Landing and some seven miles south of the island's main village of [[Codrington, Barbuda|Codrington]]. The tower is 56 feet high, has a raised gun platform and extremely thick walls, but is missing the floors. It the first such tower constructed in the Caribbean, was built in 1745 by [[Sir William Codrington]], and was designed by Commodore Charles Knowles RN, later Admiral [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]] Bt, who was then commanding the Leeward Islands station.<ref> \u201cMartello Towers Worldwide\u201d by Bill Clements,  Pen & Sword Military 2011 pp. 146-148 </ref>\n\nIt is attached to what remains of the pre-existing fort. The tower mounted three cannon, and in all the fort mounted ten cannons, none of which remain. The tower is the highest building on Barbuda and serves as a [[daymark]] from land or sea. Today the fort is a popular location for weddings.\n\n==== Australia ====\n[[File:Fort Denison 9.JPG|thumb|left|[[Fort Denison]], [[Sydney Harbour]].]]\nThe last Martello tower built in the British Empire is said to be that which composes a part of the larger [[Fort Denison, New South Wales|Fort Denison]], built on a small island, Pinchgut Island, in [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]], [[New South Wales]]. It is the only Martello tower to have been built in Australia.\n\nFortification of the island began in 1841 but was not completed. The construction had begun following an 1839 night-time incursion into [[Sydney]] Harbour by two American warships. Concern with the threat of foreign attack had caused the government to review the harbour's inner defences, which were found to be inadequate, and the establishment of a fort was recommended to help protect Sydney Harbour from attack by foreign vessels. Construction resumed in 1855 to provide Sydney with protection against the threat of a naval attack by the [[Russia]]ns during the [[Crimean War]] of the 1850s. However, construction was completed only in 1857, well after the war had ended. Fort Denison is well preserved and is now a popular tourist attraction.\n\n==== Bermuda ====\n[[File:Martello Tower seen from Ferry Island Fort, Ferry Reach, Bermuda 2011.jpg|thumb| The Martello tower at [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda]] (1822) (background), contrasts with the Ferry Island Fort (1790s) (foreground).]]\n\nThere is a Martello tower located at [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda|Ferry Reach]] in [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St George's Parish]]. The tower is the third fortification on the site.<ref>Harris (1988).</ref> Major Thomas Blanshard built it of Bermuda limestone between 1822\u20131823. The tower shows the effect of thirty years of evolution on the design of coastal fortifications, between the 1790s and 1822. The earlier ''Ferry Island Fort'' nearby had multiple guns arrayed to cover the water westward, while the Martello tower used a single gun with 360\u00b0 traverse to cover all of the surrounding area.\n\nLike its predecessors in the UK, it has an ovoid footprint with the thickness of its walls ranging from nine to 11 feet. It is surrounded by a dry moat. The tower's purpose was to defend the Ferry Reach Channel and so impede any attack on [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's Island]] from the main island of Bermuda, and attacking vessels from slipping through [[Castle Harbour]] and the channel between Ferry Reach and [[Coney Island, Bermuda|Coney Island]]. The main channel by which vessels reach most parts of Bermuda west of St. George's, including the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]], on [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland]], the [[Great Sound, Bermuda|Great Sound]], [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]], [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|The Flatts]], [[Murray's Anchorage, Bermuda|Murray's Anchorage]], and other important sites, carries them around the east ends of [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St. David's]] and [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's]] Islands, where the coastal artillery was always most heavily concentrated. Two more Martello towers to protect the Dockyard were planned, but never built.\n\nThe tower was restored in 2008 and an 18-pounder cannon brought from [[Fort St. Catherine]] was mounted on top. The site is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday to Friday in the summer and in the winter by appointment only, by calling the Parks Department. It is part of the [[Bermuda Railway]] Trail.\n\n==== British Virgin Islands ====\n[[File:Fort Recovery 01.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]], in the British Virgin Islands.]]\nWhen the British rebuilt [[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]] on the west end of [[Tortola]] they added a Martello tower.\n\n==== Canada ====\nNine of the fourteen Martello towers built in [[Canada]] still survive.<ref>Saunders (1976).</ref> (In addition, the existing fortifications at [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] received two thin towers between 1845 and 1848. However, these are dry ditch defence towers, rather than true Martello towers.) A common characteristic of Canadian Martello towers was removable cone-shaped roofs to protect against snow. Today, many of the restored towers have permanent roof additions \u2013 for ease of upkeep, not historical accuracy.\n\n[[File:Tour Martello de Quebec numero 1 - 01.JPG|thumb|left|Martello tower no. 1, Quebec City]]\n[[Quebec City]] originally had four Martello towers.

Photos suggest that Martello Menara was not a true Martello, but rather a circular fort. The tower was operational until 1878, when it became a storage site, and was abandoned in 1908. Bidadari Island was also known as Pulau Sakit (Sick Island) as it housed a leper colony during the 17th century. More recently, the island came to be called \"Angel Island\", to honour the [[leprosarium]] that had been there.\n\n==== Italy ====\n[[File:Torre di Magnisi.JPG|thumb|Magnisi tower at Priolo Gargallo.]]\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, during the British \"Protectorate\" of [[Sicily]] after the escape of the [[Bourbons]] from Naples, Sicily began to build towers to resist an invasion by Napoleon's armies led by [[Joachim Murat]]. The new higher rate of fire of ships' guns led to the choice of the Martello tower as the model.\n\nThe Sicilian Martello towers were built around 1810. The estimate rests on the historical context and on the descriptions of the topographer [[William Henry Smyth|W.H. Smyth]], who carried out his research in 1814 and 1815.\nOf the seven towers built in Sicily, only four remain. One is the Mazzone Tower (or the British Fort) at Faro Point, Messina. The second is the Magnisi tower at [[Priolo Gargallo]], Syracuse. The Italian Navy used this tower as an observation post during the Second World War. Third is the Cariddi tower at [[Ganzirri]] in [[Messina]]. Lastly, the fourth tower is situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the sea from where it can defend the [[Castello Maniace]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==== Jamaica ====\nThere is a Martello tower located at what was Fort Nugent. In 1709, the Spanish slave agent in Jamaica, James Castillo, built a fort in [[Harbour View, Jamaica|Harbour View]], to guard his home against attack. An English Governor, [[Sir George Nugent, 1st Baronet|George Nugent]], later strengthened the fort to guard the eastern entrance of the city of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] Harbour. The tower was probably built between 1808 and 1811,<ref name=Clements /> at a reported cost of \u00a312,000.\n\n==== Jersey ====\n[[File:Tou d'V\u00eende, J\u00e8rri 2.jpg|thumb|La Tour de Vinde, [[Saint Br\u00e9lade]], Jersey]]\nThe British built eight true Martello towers in [[Jersey]], three between 1808 and 1814, and five between 1834 and 1837, one of which, L'Etacq, the German occupation forces destroyed during World War II. The three original towers are:<ref name=Clements />\n* [[Icho Tower]] (1811)\n* [[Portelet Tower]] (1808)\n* [[La Tour de Vinde]] (AKA Noirmont; 1808\u20131814)<ref name=Grimsley>Grimsley (1988), p.43.</ref>\nThe four surviving, later towers are:<ref name=Clements />\n* [[Lewis Tower, Jersey|Lewis Tower]] (AKA St Ouen 1; 1835)\n* [[Kempt Tower]] (AKA St Ouen 2; 1834)\n* [[La Collette Tower]] \u2013 Absorbed into the 19th-century artificers' barracks and workshops\n* [[Victoria Tower, Jersey|Victoria Tower]] (1837)\n\nIn addition, there are a number of towers in Jersey (the [[Jersey Round Tower]]s), that are frequently referred to as Martello towers, though they are not Martellos. They were built in the late 18th century, i.e., before the Martellos, and differ from them in a number of ways. One may think of them as precursors,<ref name=Clements /> like the Genoese towers they resemble.\n\n==== Malta ====\n[[File:Malta - Pembroke - Triq Martin Luther King - Madliena Tower 03 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Madliena Tower]] (not a true Martello Tower but sometimes considered as such).]]\nThe British never built any true Martello Towers in Malta. However, [[Madliena Tower]], which was one of thirteen [[De Redin towers]] built in Malta in 1658\u20131659, began to be used as if it was a Martello Tower and it is sometimes considered as such. Various modifications were made, including mounting a 64-pound rifled muzzle loading (RML) gun on the roof for coastal defence. From the late 19th century onwards it defended part of the [[Victoria Lines]]. The tower remained in use until World War II. It still stands today, despite having some minor modifications to its original structure, and it was recently restored.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Madliena Tower \u2013 Malta's 'Martello' Tower|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/madliena-tower-maltas-martello-tower.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=19 July 2014|date=11 August 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019035044/http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/madliena-tower-maltas-martello-tower.html|archivedate=19 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Mauritius ====\nThe British built five Martello Towers between 1832 and 1835 at Grand River North West (2), Black River (2), and Port Louis (1), of which three survive. \nOne tower, named Cunningham Tower after Lieutenant-Colonel Cunningham, the commanding Royal Engineer, was constructed as part of Fort George at the northern side of the entrance to Port Louis harbour. Two towers were built at Grand River North West; on the south-west side of the river bay the tower was built at Pointe aux Sables whilst Fort Victoria was built covering the north-eastern flank. The remaining two were built to support existing batteries, which were also improved, at the mouth of the Black River; one to the north at La Preneuse and the other south of Grande-Rivi\u00e8re-Noire at Batterie de l'Harmonie. Cunningham Tower disappeared after 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://images.nationalarchives.gov.uk/assetbank-nationalarchives/action/viewAsset?id=83107&index=52&total=73&view=viewSearchItem|title=Image details - Skeleton record plan, Fort George, Mauritius - The National Archives Image library|author=|date=|website=images.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> The Tower at Fort Victoria was last mentioned in 1880.

The Friends operate it as a museum for visitors. The original entrance to the tower is raised above ground but a new entrance has been constructed at ground level. The other tower in Rive Noire/Black River district ''[L\u2019Harmonie]'' still exists but has remained neglected for many years. The other existing tower is at Pointe aux Sables, Grand River North West.\n[[File:Canon martello tower mauritius.jpg|thumb|Canon on Martello tower in La Preneuse, Black River, Mauritius]]\n\n==== Sierra Leone ====\nA Martello tower was built on Tower Hill at [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]] in 1805 to defend the port from attacks by the [[Temne people]]. It was significantly modified in 1870 when it was truncated to allow the installation of a water tank to supply Government House (Fort Thornton) with water. The tower has now been incorporated into Sierra Leone's Parliament Buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welcometosierraleone.org/heritage-sites.asp#Martello |title=National Tourist Board \u2013 Heritage Sites |publisher=Welcometosierraleone.org |accessdate=2008-10-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604073434/http://www.welcometosierraleone.org/heritage-sites.asp |archivedate=4 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== South Africa ====\n[[File:MartelloTower-FortBeaufort-SouthAfrica.JPG|thumb|Martello tower at Fort Beaufort]]\nThe British built three Martello towers in [[South Africa]], one at [[Naval Base Simon's Town|Simon's Town Naval base]] near [[Cape Town]], one at Cape Town, and the third at [[Fort Beaufort]]. The tower at Simon\u2019s Town and Cape Town were both built in 1795. The tower at Cape Town was demolished over 100 years ago, but the tower at Simon's Town now is sometimes claimed as the oldest Martello in the world. It is arguable as to whether one should properly call it a Martello Tower.<ref>Brock & Brock (1976), p.162.</ref>\n\nThat said, [[Vice Admiral]] [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|George Elphinstone]], who commanded the force that captured the colony and then served briefly as its governor, had served with the Mediterranean fleet off Corsica in 1794.<ref name=Sutcliffe /> The British built the tower at Fort Beaufort in 1837, and it is probably the only example of an inland Martello tower.\n\n==== Spain ====\n\nDuring the last period of British occupation (1798\u20131802) of [[Menorca]], Sir [[Charles Stuart (1753\u20131801)|Charles Stuart]], the then British governor, ordered Engineer Captain Robert D\u00b4Arcy to build some 12 Martello towers along the coast.<ref name=Sutcliffe /> These, when added to the three Spanish towers already in place, gave Menorca 15 towers.<ref name=Grundy />\n\nThe British built five towers to protect [[Mah\u00f3n]]: Phillipet on Lazareto Island, Cala Taulera (St. Clair) and Los Freus (Erskine) on the peninsula of La Mola, Stuart's Tower, and a tower on the Punta de Sant Carlos, which the Spanish destroyed when they took regained possession of Menorca. To the northwest of Mah\u00f3n the British built two more towers, Sa Torreta and Sa Mezquita.\n\nOne tower, the Princess Tower, or the Erskine Tower, was incorporated into the [[Fortress of Isabel II]], built between 1850 and 1875. The tower was converted to a powder magazine, which led to its destruction in 1958, when lightning struck the tower. The explosion destroyed the tower, blowing out large sections of its walls.\n\n[[File:Sanitja tower.JPG|thumb|left|Martello tower at Cap Cavalleria, Menorca.]]\nThe British erected Stuart's Tower in 1798 on Turks Hill or Hangman's Hill to the south of the port of [[Mah\u00f3n]] at San Esteban or Saint Stephen's bay on the southern side of the [[Fortress of San Felipe]]. In 1756 and again in 1781, batteries on the hill had supported successful attacks on the Fortress. The tower was built both to secure the hill and protect the entrance to the bay. The tower's name was later changed to Torre d\u00b4en Penjat, or Hangman's Tower.\n\nTo protect the harbor of [[Fornells, Menorca|Fornells]], the British built a tower on the rocky headland overlooking the harbor's mouth, and a small tower on the island of Sargantana. They complemented these two towers with two more small towers nearby, one at Sa Nitsa and one at Addaya.\n\nLastly, the British built one tower at Santandria to protect the old capital of [[Ciutadella de Menorca|Ciutadella]].\n\nIn addition to the 12 towers that they built, the British made use of three towers that the Spanish had built earlier.<ref name=Grundy>Grundy (1991).</ref>  In 1781, Captain Francisco Fernandez de Angulo had built towers south of Port Mahon at Punta Prima and Alcufar, based on the design of those that the Spanish had built in Gando, [[Gran Canaria]], in 1740. At [[Ciutadella de Menorca|Ciutadella]] the British used the St. Nicholas's Tower, built in 1690. The [[Treaty of Amiens]] returned Menorca to Spain in 1802. Around 1804, the Spanish built a tower at Punta Na Radona to protect the beach at [[Son Bou, Menorca|Son Bou]], Menorca. In 1808, Captain [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]], commanding the 38-gun [[fifth-rate]] [[sailing frigate|frigate]] {{HMS|Imperieuse|1805|6}}, sent ashore a landing party that destroyed the unarmed tower. ([[Frederick Marryat]], later a naval captain and author, was serving as a [[midshipman]] aboard ''Imperieuse'' at the time.)\n(This fort has 17 walls)\n\nThere are also four towers on the island of [[Formentera]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Clements |first=Bill |last2=Clements |first2=William H. |title=Martello Towers Worldwide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLX7kXj-lrsC&pg=PA56 |year=2011 |publisher=Casemate Publishers |location= |isbn=978-1-84884-535-0 |page=56}}</ref> and one on the nearby island of [[Espalmador|S'Empalmador]] ({{coord|38|47|5.28|N|1|25|5.01|E}}).\n\n[[File:Torre Martello San Julian Cartagena.jpg|thumb|Martello tower at Castle of San Julian, Cartagena de Levante]]Another tower was erected by English troops stationed in the fortress of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], during the [[Peninsular War]].

Two are at [[Key West, Florida]]; others were built at the harbours of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and [[New York City]]. Two more Martello towers stood at [[Tybee Island, Georgia]] and Bayou Dupre, [[Louisiana]].<ref>Angus Konstam, ''American Civil War Fortification: Coastal Stone Forts''. Osprey Publishing, 2003</ref>\n\n[[File:41stInfRegtCOA.png|thumb|41st Infantry Coat of arms with a Martello Tower]]\nAlthough the Americans copied the design from the towers the British erected in Canada, the American Martello towers differed in some significant respects from the British. The Martello tower built at [[Tybee Island, Georgia]] was constructed around 1815 utilizing wood and [[Tabby (cement)|tabby]], a common local building material at the time, instead of the brick or stone that the British towers used. Also unlike the British towers, the Tybee tower featured [[embrasure|gun loops]] on the garrison floor that enabled [[musket]]s to be fired through the walls.<ref name=\"robert19\" /> It was never tested in battle and by the time of the [[American Civil War]] was in a state of disrepair. Its unfamiliar design confused local writers, who often said that the Spanish had built the tower when Georgia was Spain's colony.<ref name=\"robert19\" />\n\nThe Key West towers, though the locals refer to them as Martellos, were square instead of round and had thin walls with long gun loops. In addition, a curtain wall of heavy guns encircled the Key West towers making them, effectively, keeps instead of standalone towers.\n\nA Martello tower figures in the arms of the [[41st Infantry Regiment (United States)|41st Infantry Regiment of the United States Army]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Inf/41%20Infantry%20Regiment.htm |title=41st Infantry Regiment |publisher=Tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil |accessdate=2008-10-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527145914/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Inf/41%20Infantry%20Regiment.htm |archivedate=27 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== List of Martello towers outside Great Britain ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Country\n!Location\n!Tower name\n!Built\n!Current status\n|-\n| [[Australia]]\n| [[Sydney]]\n| [[Fort Denison]]\n| 1856\n| Museum, harbour light station.\n|-\n| [[Barbuda]]\n| Near [[Codrington, Barbuda|Codrington]]\n| River Fort Martello Tower\n|\n|\n|-\n| [[Bermuda]]\n| [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda|Ferry Reach]]\n|\n| 1823\u20131828\n| Can be visited\n|-\n| [[British Virgin Islands]]\n| [[Tortola]]\n| [[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]]\n|\n| Private (hotel)\n|-\n| [[Canada]]\n| [[Point Pleasant Park]], [[Nova Scotia]]\n| Prince of Wales's Tower\n| 1796\n| Open to public\n|-\n|\n| [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]\n| Duke of York's Tower\n| c.1798\n| Lower levels still exist.

Most were [[coastal defence and fortification|coastal forts]].\n\nThey stand up to {{convert|40|ft|m}} high (with two floors) and typically had a garrison of one officer and 15\u201325 men. Their round structure and thick walls of solid masonry made them resistant to cannon fire, while their height made them an ideal platform for a single heavy [[artillery]] piece, mounted on the flat roof and able to traverse, and hence fire, over a complete 360\u00b0 circle. A few towers had moats or other batteries and works attached for extra defence.\n\nThe Martello towers were used during the first half of the 19th century, but became obsolete with the introduction of powerful [[rifled]] artillery. Many have survived to the present day, often preserved as historic monuments.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, during the premiership of [[Lord Palmerston]], there was another spate of tower and fort building. The [[Palmerston Forts]] are also circular in design and resemble Martello towers.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Tour de la Mortella.jpg|thumb|left|The resistance of the [[Torra di Mortella]] to the British in 1794 inspired Martello towers]]\nMartello towers were inspired by a round fortress, part of a larger [[Genoa|Genoese]] defence system, at [[Torra di Mortella|Mortella]] (Myrtle) Point in [[Corsica]]. The designer was [[Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino]] (el Fratin),<ref>Vigano (2001), pp. 41\u201357.</ref> and the tower was completed in 1565.\n\nSince the 15th century, the Corsicans had built similar towers at strategic points around the island to protect coastal villages and shipping from North African [[pirates]]. The towers stood one or two storeys high and measured {{convert|12|\u2013|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, with a single doorway five metres off the ground that one could access only via a ladder that the occupants could remove.<ref name=\"Abram 2003, p. 103\">Abram (2003), p. 103.</ref>\n\nLocal villagers paid for the towers and watchmen, known as ''torregiani'', who would signal the approach of unexpected ships by lighting a beacon fire on the tower's roof. The fire would alert the local defence forces to the threat. Although the pirate threat subsequently dwindled, the Genovese built a newer generation of circular towers (the [[Genoese tower]]s), that warded off later foreign raids.<ref name=\"Abram 2003, p. 103\" />\n\n[[File:Plaines d'Abraham et tour martello.jpg|thumb|A Martello tower on the [[plains of Abraham]] in [[Quebec City]] ([[Quebec]], [[Canada]]), at the top of Cap Diamant overlooking the [[Saint Lawrence River]].]]\nOn 7 February 1794 as part of the [[Siege of San Fiorenzo|siege of Saint-Florent]], two British warships, {{HMS|Fortitude |1780|6}} (74 guns) and {{HMS|Juno|1780|2}} (32 guns), unsuccessfully attacked the tower at Mortella Point; the tower eventually fell to land-based forces under [[John Moore (British soldier)|Sir John Moore]] after two days of heavy fighting. What helped the British was that the tower's two 18-pounder guns fired seaward, while only the one 6-pounder could fire land-ward.\n\nVice-Admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]] reported:\n\n{{quote|...The ''Fortitude'' and ''Juno'' were ordered against it, without making the least impression by a continued cannonade of two hours and a half; and the former ship being very much damaged by red-hot shot, both hauled off. The walls of the Tower were of a prodigious thickness, and the parapet, where there were two eighteen-pounders, was lined with bass junk,{{refn|Bass-junk was a type of cable made of grass.<ref>''The United Service Magazine'', Volume 51, p.301.</ref> The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' reports that \"bass\" is a name \"given elliptically to various articles made of this [fibre] or similar material; e.g. a mat, a hassock, a flat plaited bag or flexible basket.\"|group=Note}} five feet from the walls, and filled up with sand; and although it was cannonaded from the Height for two days, within 150 yards, and appeared in a very shattered state, the enemy still held out; but a few hot shot setting fire to the bass, made them call for quarter. The number of men in the Tower were 33; only two were wounded, and those mortally.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=13631|date=15 March 1794|page=222}}</ref>}}\n\nLate in the previous year, the tower's French defenders had abandoned it after {{HMS|Lowestoffe|1761|6}} (32 guns) had fired two broadsides at it. The British removed the guns to arm a small vessel; consequently, the French were easily able to dislodge the garrison of Corsican patriots that had replaced them.<ref name=Sutcliffe>Sutcliffe (1973).</ref>  Still, the British were impressed by the effectiveness of the tower when properly supplied and defended, and copied the design. But, they got the name wrong, misspelling \"Mortella\" as \"Martello\" (which means \"hammer\" in Italian). When the British withdrew from Corsica in 1803, with great difficulty they blew up the tower, leaving it in an unusable state.<ref name=Sutcliffe />\n\n== Design and construction ==\n[[File:Tour Martello 3 d\u00e9molition.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quebec City|Qu\u00e9bec city]] had four Martello towers, but tower n\u00b03 was demolished in 1904. In this picture, the internal structure can be seen.]]\nThe towers were about {{convert|40|ft|m}} high with walls about {{convert|8|ft|m}} thick. In some towers the rooms were not built in the centre, but more to the landside, leaving the walls thicker on seaside. These were cases where an attack with a cannon from the landside was thought very unlikely. Entry was by ladder to a door about {{convert|10|ft|m}} from the base above which was a machicolated (slotted) platform which allowed for downward fire on attackers. The flat roof or ''terreplein'' had a high parapet and a raised platform in the centre with a pivot (sometimes a converted cannon) for a cannon that would traverse a 360\u00b0 arc. (Some towers were designed to carry more than one gun, with each having a more limited arc of fire.) The walls had narrow slits for defensive musket fire.\n\n[[File:Martello tower diagram EN.svg|thumb|Diagram of the interior of a Martello tower]]\nThe interior of a classic British Martello tower consisted of two storeys (sometimes with an additional basement). The ground floor served as the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] and storerooms, where ammunition, water, stores and provisions were kept. The [[garrison]] of 24 men and one officer lived in a [[casemate]] on the first floor, which was divided into several rooms and had fireplaces built into the walls for cooking and heating.<ref name=\"robert19\">Ciucevich (2005), pp. 19\u201321.</ref> The officer and men lived in separate rooms of almost equal size. A well or cistern within the fort supplied the garrison with water. An internal drainage system linked to the roof enabled rainwater to refill the cistern.<ref name=\"robert19\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n== Martello towers around the world ==\n[[File:Martello towers worldwide map.png|thumb|center|600px|Distribution of Martello towers worldwide]]\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the British government embarked on a large-scale programme of building Martello towers to guard the British and Irish coastlines. Around 140 were built, mostly along the south coast of [[England]]. Governments in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Menorca]], [[South Africa]] and [[Sri Lanka]] also constructed towers. The construction of Martello towers abroad continued until as late as the 1870s but was discontinued after it became clear that they could not withstand the new generation of rifled artillery weapons.\n\nThe French built similar towers along their own coastline that they used as platforms for communication by [[optical telegraph]]s (using the [[Claude Chappe|Chappe Telegraph]]). The [[United States]] government also built a number of Martello towers along the east coast of the US that copied the British design with some modifications.\n\n=== United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ===\n[[File:Portmarnock martello.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[Portmarnock]] Martello tower, one of many on Ireland's east coast]]\nGreat Britain and Ireland were united as a single political entity, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], from 1801 to 1922, spanning the time during which most Martello towers were erected (the initial scheme started under the previous entities of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland]]). Consequently, the Martello towers of Great Britain and Ireland can be considered to have been part of a single defensive system, designed to protect the coastlines of the two main islands of the [[British Isles]] as a whole.<ref>Rooke (1857), p.68.</ref><ref name=Clements>Clements (1998).</ref>\n\nThis is most clearly visible on the south and east coasts of [[England]] and the east coast of [[Ireland]], where chains of Martello towers were built. Elsewhere in the world, individual Martello towers were erected to provide point defence of strategic locations.\n\n==== England ====\n[[File:Martello tower 500.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of a Martello tower]]\nBetween 1804 and 1812 the British authorities built a chain of towers based on the original Mortella tower to [[British anti-invasion preparations of 1803\u20131805|defend the south and east coast of England]], Ireland, [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]] to guard against [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|possible invasion]] from [[France]], then under the rule of the [[Napoleon I of France|Emperor Napoleon]]. A total of 103<ref name=Sutcliffe /> Martello towers were built in England, set at regular intervals along the coast from [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]], [[Sussex]], to [[Aldeburgh]], [[Suffolk]]. Most were constructed under the direction of General [[William Twiss]] (1745\u20131827) and a Captain Ford.<ref>Mead (1948), pp. 205\u201317, 294\u2013303.</ref><ref>Ward (1949), pp. 18\u201337.</ref>  The northern-most tower at Aldeburgh is of quatrefoil design, i.e. four in one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/martello-tower-9317|title=Holiday at Martello Tower in Aldeburgh, Suffolk - The Landmark Trust|website=www.landmarktrust.org.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211003141/http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/martello-tower-9317|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIncluded in the scheme were three much larger circular forts or [[redoubt]]s that were constructed at [[Harwich Redoubt|Harwich]], [[Dymchurch Redoubt|Dymchurch]] and [[Eastbourne Redoubt|Eastbourne]]; they acted as supply depots for the smaller towers as well as being powerful fortifications in their own right.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.martello-towers.co.uk/south-coast/towers/dymchurch-redoubt.htm |title=Dymchurch Redoubt |publisher=Martello-towers.co.uk |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2010-12-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223024147/http://www.martello-towers.co.uk/south-coast/towers/dymchurch-redoubt.htm |archivedate=23 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of Britain's Martello towers was never actually tested in combat against a Napoleonic invasion fleet. They were, however, effective in hindering smuggling.<ref>Daly (2007), p.34.</ref> After the threat had passed, the Martello towers in England met a variety of fates. [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|The Coastguard]] took over many to aid in the fight against smuggling.\n[[File:Martello tower 700.jpg|thumb|A Martello tower at [[Clacton-on-Sea]] on the east coast of England.]]\nFifteen towers were demolished to enable the re-use of their masonry. The sea washed thirty away and the military destroyed four in experiments to test the effectiveness of the new [[rifled]] artillery. During the [[Second World War]], some Martello towers returned to military service as observation platforms and firing platforms for [[anti-aircraft artillery]].\n\nForty-seven Martello towers have survived in England, a few of which have been restored and transformed into museums (e.g., the tower at [[St Osyth and Seaford]]) visitor centres, and galleries (such as [[Jaywick Martello Tower]]).

The most notable surviving towers are the two located in [[Pembroke Dock]], which were built between 1848 and 1857 to protect the naval base there. Today, one of the towers is privately owned. The other is located on the town's riverfront, next to the old entrance of the naval base. It was converted into a small museum that focused on the local history of the dock and its defences. The museum has now shut down because of water influx.

On the east coast, concentrated mainly around Dublin Bay, twenty-six towers were in line of sight of each other, providing the ability to communicate with one another, or warn of any incoming attacks.\n\nPossibly the most famous is the Martello tower in [[Sandycove]], near [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]], in which [[James Joyce]] lived for a few days. Joyce shared the tower with [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]], then a medical student but later to become famous in Irish history as a surgeon, politician and writer. In ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', the fictional character [[Stephen Dedalus]] lives in the tower with a medical student, Malachi \"Buck\" Mulligan, whom Joyce based on Gogarty. The [[James Joyce Tower]], as the tower is now known, houses a museum dedicated to Joyce.\n\nA number of other Martello towers are extant nearby at [[Bullock Harbour]], [[Dalkey Island]], [[Blackrock, Dublin|Williamstown]], [[Seapoint]] and [[Sandymount]] and Martello towers feature in many literary works set in [[Dublin]]. During the 1980s, [[Bono]] owned the Martello tower in [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], [[County Wicklow]].\n\n[[File:Killiney Martello No7.jpg|thumb|left|Martello tower (South No.7) at [[Killiney]]]]\nMartello Tower South No.7, on Tara Hill, Killiney Bay, is unique, as is its location as an [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading tower]].

The other Cork Harbour towers are at [[Ringaskiddy]], [[Haulbowline Island]] (now part of the Irish Naval Service HQ) and at [[Belvelly]] and [[Rossleague]] on the [[Great Island]] (near [[Cobh]]). There are also Martello towers at [[Little Island, Cork|Little Island]] and [[Rostellan]], though these are no longer intact.\n\nThe British built two Martello towers on the Hook Peninsula to protect the fort near [[Duncannon]], [[Co. Wexford]] and the entrance to [[Waterford]] Harbour. There is a third tower on the headland at Baginbun Bay in Co. Wexford.\n\nOne of the most interesting Martello towers is [[Meelick Martello Tower]] at [[Clonahenoge]], [[County Offaly]], guarding the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] river crossing to [[Meelick, County Galway]].

There is also an extant Martello tower located near the settlement of [[Magilligan|Magilligan Point]] in [[County Londonderry]], built between 1812 and 1871 to defend against a possible French invasion during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; it is now currently used as a visitor attraction. <ref>https://discovernorthernireland.com/Magilligan-Martello-Tower-Limavady-P2926/</ref>\n\nA Martello-like tower was built on [[Achill Island]], according to local memory during the Napoleonic Wars. It is square rather than round, unlike the traditional Martello tower. This tower is known locally as the Gabhla Fhranca (\"French Tower\") or the Napoleonic Tower. It is marked on an 1838 [[Ordnance Survey]] chart and denoted \"Signal Tower,\" suggesting it was used with a series of other stations for communication. The tower's position offers a view of the sea both to the north and south of the island and is therefore well-suited for that purpose. By the 1830s the tower was described as a \"watch-house of the coast-guard.\"\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==== Antigua and Barbuda ====\n[[File:Antigua 8 Cent Stamp 1953.jpg|thumb|A 1953 stamp of Antigua showing the Martello Tower in Barbuda.]]\nThe British originally constructed River Fort Martello Tower in the early 19th century, on the site of a previous fort (presumed to have been built by the Spanish) to guard nearby River Landing, which was [[Barbuda]]'s original quay. Confusion with the previous fort is presumably explains the claims made in Barbudian tourism publications that this was the World's first, and is its oldest, Martello tower, built in 1745.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/beautifulbarbudamagazine/docs/beautiful_barbuda_2012|title=Beautiful Barbuda 2012|website=issuu|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809144415/https://issuu.com/beautifulbarbudamagazine/docs/beautiful_barbuda_2012|archivedate=9 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  The tower is located on the south coast of the island, a mile or so from River Landing and some seven miles south of the island's main village of [[Codrington, Barbuda|Codrington]]. The tower is 56 feet high, has a raised gun platform and extremely thick walls, but is missing the floors. It the first such tower constructed in the Caribbean, was built in 1745 by [[Sir William Codrington]], and was designed by Commodore Charles Knowles RN, later Admiral [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]] Bt, who was then commanding the Leeward Islands station.<ref> \u201cMartello Towers Worldwide\u201d by Bill Clements,  Pen & Sword Military 2011 pp. 146-148 </ref>\n\nIt is attached to what remains of the pre-existing fort. The tower mounted three cannon, and in all the fort mounted ten cannons, none of which remain. The tower is the highest building on Barbuda and serves as a [[daymark]] from land or sea. Today the fort is a popular location for weddings.\n\n==== Australia ====\n[[File:Fort Denison 9.JPG|thumb|left|[[Fort Denison]], [[Sydney Harbour]].]]\nThe last Martello tower built in the British Empire is said to be that which composes a part of the larger [[Fort Denison, New South Wales|Fort Denison]], built on a small island, Pinchgut Island, in [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]], [[New South Wales]]. It is the only Martello tower to have been built in Australia.\n\nFortification of the island began in 1841 but was not completed. The construction had begun following an 1839 night-time incursion into [[Sydney]] Harbour by two American warships. Concern with the threat of foreign attack had caused the government to review the harbour's inner defences, which were found to be inadequate, and the establishment of a fort was recommended to help protect Sydney Harbour from attack by foreign vessels. Construction resumed in 1855 to provide Sydney with protection against the threat of a naval attack by the [[Russia]]ns during the [[Crimean War]] of the 1850s. However, construction was completed only in 1857, well after the war had ended. Fort Denison is well preserved and is now a popular tourist attraction.\n\n==== Bermuda ====\n[[File:Martello Tower seen from Ferry Island Fort, Ferry Reach, Bermuda 2011.jpg|thumb| The Martello tower at [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda]] (1822) (background), contrasts with the Ferry Island Fort (1790s) (foreground).]]\n\nThere is a Martello tower located at [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda|Ferry Reach]] in [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St George's Parish]]. The tower is the third fortification on the site.<ref>Harris (1988).</ref> Major Thomas Blanshard built it of Bermuda limestone between 1822\u20131823. The tower shows the effect of thirty years of evolution on the design of coastal fortifications, between the 1790s and 1822. The earlier ''Ferry Island Fort'' nearby had multiple guns arrayed to cover the water westward, while the Martello tower used a single gun with 360\u00b0 traverse to cover all of the surrounding area.\n\nLike its predecessors in the UK, it has an ovoid footprint with the thickness of its walls ranging from nine to 11 feet. It is surrounded by a dry moat. The tower's purpose was to defend the Ferry Reach Channel and so impede any attack on [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's Island]] from the main island of Bermuda, and attacking vessels from slipping through [[Castle Harbour]] and the channel between Ferry Reach and [[Coney Island, Bermuda|Coney Island]]. The main channel by which vessels reach most parts of Bermuda west of St. George's, including the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]], on [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland]], the [[Great Sound, Bermuda|Great Sound]], [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]], [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|The Flatts]], [[Murray's Anchorage, Bermuda|Murray's Anchorage]], and other important sites, carries them around the east ends of [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St. David's]] and [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's]] Islands, where the coastal artillery was always most heavily concentrated. Two more Martello towers to protect the Dockyard were planned, but never built.\n\nThe tower was restored in 2008 and an 18-pounder cannon brought from [[Fort St. Catherine]] was mounted on top. The site is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday to Friday in the summer and in the winter by appointment only, by calling the Parks Department. It is part of the [[Bermuda Railway]] Trail.\n\n==== British Virgin Islands ====\n[[File:Fort Recovery 01.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]], in the British Virgin Islands.]]\nWhen the British rebuilt [[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]] on the west end of [[Tortola]] they added a Martello tower.\n\n==== Canada ====\nNine of the fourteen Martello towers built in [[Canada]] still survive.<ref>Saunders (1976).</ref> (In addition, the existing fortifications at [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] received two thin towers between 1845 and 1848. However, these are dry ditch defence towers, rather than true Martello towers.) A common characteristic of Canadian Martello towers was removable cone-shaped roofs to protect against snow. Today, many of the restored towers have permanent roof additions \u2013 for ease of upkeep, not historical accuracy.\n\n[[File:Tour Martello de Quebec numero 1 - 01.JPG|thumb|left|Martello tower no. 1, Quebec City]]\n[[Quebec City]] originally had four Martello towers.

Photos suggest that Martello Menara was not a true Martello, but rather a circular fort. The tower was operational until 1878, when it became a storage site, and was abandoned in 1908. Bidadari Island was also known as Pulau Sakit (Sick Island) as it housed a leper colony during the 17th century. More recently, the island came to be called \"Angel Island\", to honour the [[leprosarium]] that had been there.\n\n==== Italy ====\n[[File:Torre di Magnisi.JPG|thumb|Magnisi tower at Priolo Gargallo.]]\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, during the British \"Protectorate\" of [[Sicily]] after the escape of the [[Bourbons]] from Naples, Sicily began to build towers to resist an invasion by Napoleon's armies led by [[Joachim Murat]]. The new higher rate of fire of ships' guns led to the choice of the Martello tower as the model.\n\nThe Sicilian Martello towers were built around 1810. The estimate rests on the historical context and on the descriptions of the topographer [[William Henry Smyth|W.H. Smyth]], who carried out his research in 1814 and 1815.\nOf the seven towers built in Sicily, only four remain. One is the Mazzone Tower (or the British Fort) at Faro Point, Messina. The second is the Magnisi tower at [[Priolo Gargallo]], Syracuse. The Italian Navy used this tower as an observation post during the Second World War. Third is the Cariddi tower at [[Ganzirri]] in [[Messina]]. Lastly, the fourth tower is situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the sea from where it can defend the [[Castello Maniace]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==== Jamaica ====\nThere is a Martello tower located at what was Fort Nugent. In 1709, the Spanish slave agent in Jamaica, James Castillo, built a fort in [[Harbour View, Jamaica|Harbour View]], to guard his home against attack. An English Governor, [[Sir George Nugent, 1st Baronet|George Nugent]], later strengthened the fort to guard the eastern entrance of the city of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] Harbour. The tower was probably built between 1808 and 1811,<ref name=Clements /> at a reported cost of \u00a312,000.\n\n==== Jersey ====\n[[File:Tou d'V\u00eende, J\u00e8rri 2.jpg|thumb|La Tour de Vinde, [[Saint Br\u00e9lade]], Jersey]]\nThe British built eight true Martello towers in [[Jersey]], three between 1808 and 1814, and five between 1834 and 1837, one of which, L'Etacq, the German occupation forces destroyed during World War II. The three original towers are:<ref name=Clements />\n* [[Icho Tower]] (1811)\n* [[Portelet Tower]] (1808)\n* [[La Tour de Vinde]] (AKA Noirmont; 1808\u20131814)<ref name=Grimsley>Grimsley (1988), p.43.</ref>\nThe four surviving, later towers are:<ref name=Clements />\n* [[Lewis Tower, Jersey|Lewis Tower]] (AKA St Ouen 1; 1835)\n* [[Kempt Tower]] (AKA St Ouen 2; 1834)\n* [[La Collette Tower]] \u2013 Absorbed into the 19th-century artificers' barracks and workshops\n* [[Victoria Tower, Jersey|Victoria Tower]] (1837)\n\nIn addition, there are a number of towers in Jersey (the [[Jersey Round Tower]]s), that are frequently referred to as Martello towers, though they are not Martellos. They were built in the late 18th century, i.e., before the Martellos, and differ from them in a number of ways. One may think of them as precursors,<ref name=Clements /> like the Genoese towers they resemble.\n\n==== Malta ====\n[[File:Malta - Pembroke - Triq Martin Luther King - Madliena Tower 03 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Madliena Tower]] (not a true Martello Tower but sometimes considered as such).]]\nThe British never built any true Martello Towers in Malta. However, [[Madliena Tower]], which was one of thirteen [[De Redin towers]] built in Malta in 1658\u20131659, began to be used as if it was a Martello Tower and it is sometimes considered as such. Various modifications were made, including mounting a 64-pound rifled muzzle loading (RML) gun on the roof for coastal defence. From the late 19th century onwards it defended part of the [[Victoria Lines]]. The tower remained in use until World War II. It still stands today, despite having some minor modifications to its original structure, and it was recently restored.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Madliena Tower \u2013 Malta's 'Martello' Tower|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/madliena-tower-maltas-martello-tower.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=19 July 2014|date=11 August 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019035044/http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/madliena-tower-maltas-martello-tower.html|archivedate=19 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Mauritius ====\nThe British built five Martello Towers between 1832 and 1835 at Grand River North West (2), Black River (2), and Port Louis (1), of which three survive. \nOne tower, named Cunningham Tower after Lieutenant-Colonel Cunningham, the commanding Royal Engineer, was constructed as part of Fort George at the northern side of the entrance to Port Louis harbour. Two towers were built at Grand River North West; on the south-west side of the river bay the tower was built at Pointe aux Sables whilst Fort Victoria was built covering the north-eastern flank. The remaining two were built to support existing batteries, which were also improved, at the mouth of the Black River; one to the north at La Preneuse and the other south of Grande-Rivi\u00e8re-Noire at Batterie de l'Harmonie. Cunningham Tower disappeared after 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://images.nationalarchives.gov.uk/assetbank-nationalarchives/action/viewAsset?id=83107&index=52&total=73&view=viewSearchItem|title=Image details - Skeleton record plan, Fort George, Mauritius - The National Archives Image library|author=|date=|website=images.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> The Tower at Fort Victoria was last mentioned in 1880.

The Friends operate it as a museum for visitors. The original entrance to the tower is raised above ground but a new entrance has been constructed at ground level. The other tower in Rive Noire/Black River district ''[L\u2019Harmonie]'' still exists but has remained neglected for many years. The other existing tower is at Pointe aux Sables, Grand River North West.\n[[File:Canon martello tower mauritius.jpg|thumb|Canon on Martello tower in La Preneuse, Black River, Mauritius]]\n\n==== Sierra Leone ====\nA Martello tower was built on Tower Hill at [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]] in 1805 to defend the port from attacks by the [[Temne people]]. It was significantly modified in 1870 when it was truncated to allow the installation of a water tank to supply Government House (Fort Thornton) with water. The tower has now been incorporated into Sierra Leone's Parliament Buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welcometosierraleone.org/heritage-sites.asp#Martello |title=National Tourist Board \u2013 Heritage Sites |publisher=Welcometosierraleone.org |accessdate=2008-10-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604073434/http://www.welcometosierraleone.org/heritage-sites.asp |archivedate=4 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== South Africa ====\n[[File:MartelloTower-FortBeaufort-SouthAfrica.JPG|thumb|Martello tower at Fort Beaufort]]\nThe British built three Martello towers in [[South Africa]], one at [[Naval Base Simon's Town|Simon's Town Naval base]] near [[Cape Town]], one at Cape Town, and the third at [[Fort Beaufort]]. The tower at Simon\u2019s Town and Cape Town were both built in 1795. The tower at Cape Town was demolished over 100 years ago, but the tower at Simon's Town now is sometimes claimed as the oldest Martello in the world. It is arguable as to whether one should properly call it a Martello Tower.<ref>Brock & Brock (1976), p.162.</ref>\n\nThat said, [[Vice Admiral]] [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|George Elphinstone]], who commanded the force that captured the colony and then served briefly as its governor, had served with the Mediterranean fleet off Corsica in 1794.<ref name=Sutcliffe /> The British built the tower at Fort Beaufort in 1837, and it is probably the only example of an inland Martello tower.\n\n==== Spain ====\n\nDuring the last period of British occupation (1798\u20131802) of [[Menorca]], Sir [[Charles Stuart (1753\u20131801)|Charles Stuart]], the then British governor, ordered Engineer Captain Robert D\u00b4Arcy to build some 12 Martello towers along the coast.<ref name=Sutcliffe /> These, when added to the three Spanish towers already in place, gave Menorca 15 towers.<ref name=Grundy />\n\nThe British built five towers to protect [[Mah\u00f3n]]: Phillipet on Lazareto Island, Cala Taulera (St. Clair) and Los Freus (Erskine) on the peninsula of La Mola, Stuart's Tower, and a tower on the Punta de Sant Carlos, which the Spanish destroyed when they took regained possession of Menorca. To the northwest of Mah\u00f3n the British built two more towers, Sa Torreta and Sa Mezquita.\n\nOne tower, the Princess Tower, or the Erskine Tower, was incorporated into the [[Fortress of Isabel II]], built between 1850 and 1875. The tower was converted to a powder magazine, which led to its destruction in 1958, when lightning struck the tower. The explosion destroyed the tower, blowing out large sections of its walls.\n\n[[File:Sanitja tower.JPG|thumb|left|Martello tower at Cap Cavalleria, Menorca.]]\nThe British erected Stuart's Tower in 1798 on Turks Hill or Hangman's Hill to the south of the port of [[Mah\u00f3n]] at San Esteban or Saint Stephen's bay on the southern side of the [[Fortress of San Felipe]]. In 1756 and again in 1781, batteries on the hill had supported successful attacks on the Fortress. The tower was built both to secure the hill and protect the entrance to the bay. The tower's name was later changed to Torre d\u00b4en Penjat, or Hangman's Tower.\n\nTo protect the harbor of [[Fornells, Menorca|Fornells]], the British built a tower on the rocky headland overlooking the harbor's mouth, and a small tower on the island of Sargantana. They complemented these two towers with two more small towers nearby, one at Sa Nitsa and one at Addaya.\n\nLastly, the British built one tower at Santandria to protect the old capital of [[Ciutadella de Menorca|Ciutadella]].\n\nIn addition to the 12 towers that they built, the British made use of three towers that the Spanish had built earlier.<ref name=Grundy>Grundy (1991).</ref>  In 1781, Captain Francisco Fernandez de Angulo had built towers south of Port Mahon at Punta Prima and Alcufar, based on the design of those that the Spanish had built in Gando, [[Gran Canaria]], in 1740. At [[Ciutadella de Menorca|Ciutadella]] the British used the St. Nicholas's Tower, built in 1690. The [[Treaty of Amiens]] returned Menorca to Spain in 1802. Around 1804, the Spanish built a tower at Punta Na Radona to protect the beach at [[Son Bou, Menorca|Son Bou]], Menorca. In 1808, Captain [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]], commanding the 38-gun [[fifth-rate]] [[sailing frigate|frigate]] {{HMS|Imperieuse|1805|6}}, sent ashore a landing party that destroyed the unarmed tower. ([[Frederick Marryat]], later a naval captain and author, was serving as a [[midshipman]] aboard ''Imperieuse'' at the time.)\n(This fort has 17 walls)\n\nThere are also four towers on the island of [[Formentera]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Clements |first=Bill |last2=Clements |first2=William H. |title=Martello Towers Worldwide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLX7kXj-lrsC&pg=PA56 |year=2011 |publisher=Casemate Publishers |location= |isbn=978-1-84884-535-0 |page=56}}</ref> and one on the nearby island of [[Espalmador|S'Empalmador]] ({{coord|38|47|5.28|N|1|25|5.01|E}}).\n\n[[File:Torre Martello San Julian Cartagena.jpg|thumb|Martello tower at Castle of San Julian, Cartagena de Levante]]Another tower was erected by English troops stationed in the fortress of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], during the [[Peninsular War]].

Two are at [[Key West, Florida]]; others were built at the harbours of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and [[New York City]]. Two more Martello towers stood at [[Tybee Island, Georgia]] and Bayou Dupre, [[Louisiana]].<ref>Angus Konstam, ''American Civil War Fortification: Coastal Stone Forts''. Osprey Publishing, 2003</ref>\n\n[[File:41stInfRegtCOA.png|thumb|41st Infantry Coat of arms with a Martello Tower]]\nAlthough the Americans copied the design from the towers the British erected in Canada, the American Martello towers differed in some significant respects from the British. The Martello tower built at [[Tybee Island, Georgia]] was constructed around 1815 utilizing wood and [[Tabby (cement)|tabby]], a common local building material at the time, instead of the brick or stone that the British towers used. Also unlike the British towers, the Tybee tower featured [[embrasure|gun loops]] on the garrison floor that enabled [[musket]]s to be fired through the walls.<ref name=\"robert19\" /> It was never tested in battle and by the time of the [[American Civil War]] was in a state of disrepair. Its unfamiliar design confused local writers, who often said that the Spanish had built the tower when Georgia was Spain's colony.<ref name=\"robert19\" />\n\nThe Key West towers, though the locals refer to them as Martellos, were square instead of round and had thin walls with long gun loops. In addition, a curtain wall of heavy guns encircled the Key West towers making them, effectively, keeps instead of standalone towers.\n\nA Martello tower figures in the arms of the [[41st Infantry Regiment (United States)|41st Infantry Regiment of the United States Army]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Inf/41%20Infantry%20Regiment.htm |title=41st Infantry Regiment |publisher=Tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil |accessdate=2008-10-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527145914/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Inf/41%20Infantry%20Regiment.htm |archivedate=27 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== List of Martello towers outside Great Britain ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Country\n!Location\n!Tower name\n!Built\n!Current status\n|-\n| [[Australia]]\n| [[Sydney]]\n| [[Fort Denison]]\n| 1856\n| Museum, harbour light station.\n|-\n| [[Barbuda]]\n| Near [[Codrington, Barbuda|Codrington]]\n| River Fort Martello Tower\n|\n|\n|-\n| [[Bermuda]]\n| [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda|Ferry Reach]]\n|\n| 1823\u20131828\n| Can be visited\n|-\n| [[British Virgin Islands]]\n| [[Tortola]]\n| [[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]]\n|\n| Private (hotel)\n|-\n| [[Canada]]\n| [[Point Pleasant Park]], [[Nova Scotia]]\n| Prince of Wales's Tower\n| 1796\n| Open to public\n|-\n|\n| [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]\n| Duke of York's Tower\n| c.1798\n| Lower levels still exist.

At the surface, a cold front was expected to progress across the Southeast United States while an intensifying area of low pressure propagated northeast along the boundary. The environment along and ahead of this front was anticipated to be favorable for severe weather, featuring dewpoints as high as the low 70s Fahrenheit, mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy on the order of 1,000\u20132,000&nbsp;J/kg, and a {{convert|40\u201360|kn|mph|abbr=on}} contributing to large hodographs and strong cyclonic updraft potential. In addition, advection of drier air aloft was predicted to inhibit convective development until later in the day.

The tornado was initially weak, causing minor EF0 to EF1 tree and roof damage in DeRidder. The tornado exited DeRidder, widening and strengthening as it continued northeastward into [[Vernon Parish, Louisiana|Vernon Parish]] and reaching EF3 strength as it passed to the southeast of [[Rosepine, Louisiana|Rosepine]]. Severe damage occurred along Mac Sterling Road, John Brewer Road, and Borel Road, where a couple of manufactured homes were obliterated with the debris scattered long distances through nearby fields. Outbuildings were destroyed, many large trees were snapped or uprooted, and some frame homes sustained partial to total roof loss. A few of these frame homes sustained some collapse of exterior walls as well. A 59-year old woman was killed in her home by the tornado in this area. The tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as it continued to the northeast, crossing [[Louisiana Highway 10]], where a church lost a portion of its metal roof and outbuildings were destroyed. Numerous trees were snapped as well. EF2 damage occurred beyond this point as the tornado moved through forested areas of [[Fort Polk]], snapping and uprooting countless trees. A structure sustained loss of its metal roof and collapse of brick facade in this area as well.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref> Exiting Fort Polk, the tornado narrowed and weakened again, causing EF0 to EF1 tree damage is it moved through unpopulated areas. Additional minor EF0 and EF1 tree damage occurred as the tornado continued into [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]], moving to the northeast as it passed near [[Hineston, Louisiana|Hineston]] and [[Otis, Louisiana|Otis]]. Restrengthening then occurred as extensive EF2 tree damage occurred near the Kincaid Reservoir. Numerous trees were snapped and denuded, and a few sustained some low-end debarking. Maintaining EF2 strength, the strong tornado then entered the west side of [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]]. Numerous mobile homes were thrown and destroyed at a mobile home sales business along Ross Lane, while nearby homes sustained significant roof damage. A few outbuildings were destroyed as well. The tornado strengthened and widened further just past this location, producing EF3 damage along Stovall Road. Several large metal buildings were completely destroyed in this area, and a large portion of the nearby Hope Baptist School was destroyed at EF3 intensity as well, with large amounts of debris was scattered throughout the area. The tornado then crossed [[Louisiana Highway 28]] and heavily damaged a sports complex along the north side of the highway. Continuing to the east-northeast, additional EF3 damage occurred as a convenience store was destroyed, and a nearby large metal-framed warehouse building was destroyed as well along John Allison Drive.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref> A manufactured home was overturned in this area as well. In a nearby residential area, the tornado weakened to EF2 strength as large trees were downed, and homes had large portions of their roofs torn off. Continuing to the northeast through Alexandria, the tornado narrowed and weakened to EF1 strength, damaging trees and power poles as it crossed Bayou Rapides Road. Along Enterprise Road, a warehouse building sustained EF1 damage to its roof and doors. The tornado proceeded to cross the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and entered [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]], first causing EF1 damage to structures at the Pineville Municipal Airport. The tornado moved along a northeasterly path through residential areas of Pineville, snapping and uprooting numerous large trees. Some of these trees fell onto houses and caused heavy damage. A majority of the damage in Pineville was rated EF1, though a small pocket of EF2 damage occurred along Edgewood Drive, where a house sustained considerable structural damage. Past this area, the tornado continued to narrow and weaken, eventually dissipating after producing some EF0 tree limb damage along Donahue Ferry Road in Pineville.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref>\n\nOverall, this EF3 tornado caused one fatality along its 62-mile long path.

Past the airport, the tornado caused EF0 to EF1 damage at the Dixie Golf Club, where trees and tree limbs were snapped and fencing was blown over. The tornado moved along a northeastward path through the southwest side of Laurel, downing trees and causing minor roof damage to homes. Metal roofing was torn off of a three-story motel along Jefferson street as well. Damage along this section of the path was rated EF0 to EF1 in intensity. Crossing South 16th Avenue, the tornado reached EF2 strength, where a small brick office building sustained roof and exterior wall loss, and a strip mall was heavily damaged. The roof of a hotel was lifted up and dropped back down onto the building, and a semi-truck and flatbed trailer carrying automobiles was flipped over and dragged. Continuing to the northeast through Laurel, the tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as numerous homes, warehouses, apartment buildings, and other structures sustained minor to moderate roof damage. One large building lost roughly 20% of its metal roof, and sustained collapse of brick facade. A [[Piggly Wiggly]] grocery store also sustained minor EF0 roof and exterior damage in this area as well, and numerous trees and a few power poles were downed. The tornado continued to the northeast through residential neighborhoods at EF1 intensity, snapping and uprooting trees and causing roof damage to additional homes. Some trees fell onto houses and cars as well. A metal self-storage building was partially destroyed along North 1st Avenue, and a large warehouse building near North Railroad Avenue sustained considerable roof damage. The tornado reached EF2 intensity again as moved through the eastern part of Laurel, where a house had its roof torn off and other homes sustained lesser roof damage. The Nora Davis Magnet school also lost much of its roof in this area. The tornado then reached EF3 intensity as it exited Laurel and crossed [[Interstate 59]], snapping and uprooting numerous trees, and toppling several large metal truss transmission towers to the ground. EF3 damage continued as the tornado then completely destroyed the Wade Services manufacturing plant, along with several other metal buildings and an office building on the property. Northeast of this area, the tornado momentarily weakened and caused EF1 tree damage as it moved along the east side of Interstate 59. The tornado became strong again as it then impacted the southern fringes of [[Sandersville, Mississippi|Sandersville]] at EF2 strength, where a house sustained loss of much of its roof, along with some second floor exterior walls. Another home sustained major roof damage, outbuildings were damaged or destroyed, numerous large trees were snapped or uprooted, and two people sustained minor injuries in the Sandersville area.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref> Past Sandersville, the tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as it struck the Mississippi Choctaw Reservation, where homes sustained roof and garage damage, a small pavilion collapsed, trees were downed, and headstones were tipped over at a cemetery. EF0 and EF1 damage to trees and homes continued through the extreme northwestern corner of [[Wayne County, Mississippi|Wayne County]] and into the southwestern corner of [[Clarke County, Mississippi|Clarke County]], though a small pocket of EF2 damage occurred along County Road 223, where numerous large trees were snapped and a mobile home was rolled and destroyed. Additional EF2 damage occurred as the tornado crossed [[U.S. Route 45]] north of [[Shubuta, Mississippi|Shubuta]], where a well-built home had most if its roof torn off. Northeast of Shubuta, numerous trees were snapped and uprooted at EF1 strength as the tornado moved through rural areas. A few outbuildings and mobile homes were damaged as well. A final area of EF2 damage occurred to the southwest of the small community of [[Mannassa, Mississippi|Mannassa]], where a well-built home along County Road 664 sustained destruction of its attached garage, and had a large portion of its roof torn off. A nearby mobile home was rolled and destroyed as well. Northeast of Mannassa, the tornado weakened to EF0 strength as it approached the Alabama border, causing only tree limb damage in rural areas. The tornado then regained EF1 strength as it crossed into [[Choctaw County, Alabama]], downing trees and destroying a mobile home. Additional trees were snapped or uprooted, and a house sustained partial removal of its roof before the tornado dissipated to the west-northwest of [[Lisman, Alabama]] after traveling {{convert|61.31|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref>\n\nThe tornado was rated EF3 and injured two people.

At the surface, a cold front was expected to progress across the Southeast United States while an intensifying area of low pressure propagated northeast along the boundary. The environment along and ahead of this front was anticipated to be favorable for severe weather, featuring dewpoints as high as the low 70s Fahrenheit, mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy on the order of 1,000\u20132,000&nbsp;J/kg, and a {{convert|40\u201360|kn|mph|abbr=on}} contributing to large hodographs and strong cyclonic updraft potential. In addition, advection of drier air aloft was predicted to inhibit convective development until later in the day.

The tornado was initially weak, causing minor EF0 to EF1 tree and roof damage in DeRidder. The tornado exited DeRidder, widening and strengthening as it continued northeastward into [[Vernon Parish, Louisiana|Vernon Parish]] and reaching EF3 strength as it passed to the southeast of [[Rosepine, Louisiana|Rosepine]]. Severe damage occurred along Mac Sterling Road, John Brewer Road, and Borel Road, where a couple of manufactured homes were obliterated with the debris scattered long distances through nearby fields. Outbuildings were destroyed, many large trees were snapped or uprooted, and some frame homes sustained partial to total roof loss. A few of these frame homes sustained some collapse of exterior walls as well. A 59-year old woman was killed in her home by the tornado in this area. The tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as it continued to the northeast, crossing [[Louisiana Highway 10]], where a church lost a portion of its metal roof and outbuildings were destroyed. Numerous trees were snapped as well. EF2 damage occurred beyond this point as the tornado moved through forested areas of [[Fort Polk]], snapping and uprooting countless trees. A structure sustained loss of its metal roof and collapse of brick facade in this area as well.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref> Exiting Fort Polk, the tornado narrowed and weakened again, causing EF0 to EF1 tree damage is it moved through unpopulated areas. Additional minor EF0 and EF1 tree damage occurred as the tornado continued into [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]], moving to the northeast as it passed near [[Hineston, Louisiana|Hineston]] and [[Otis, Louisiana|Otis]]. Restrengthening then occurred as extensive EF2 tree damage occurred near the Kincaid Reservoir. Numerous trees were snapped and denuded, and a few sustained some low-end debarking. Maintaining EF2 strength, the strong tornado then entered the west side of [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]]. Numerous mobile homes were thrown and destroyed at a mobile home sales business along Ross Lane, while nearby homes sustained significant roof damage. A few outbuildings were destroyed as well. The tornado strengthened and widened further just past this location, producing EF3 damage along Stovall Road. Several large metal buildings were completely destroyed in this area, and a large portion of the nearby Hope Baptist School was destroyed at EF3 intensity as well, with large amounts of debris was scattered throughout the area. The tornado then crossed [[Louisiana Highway 28]] and heavily damaged a sports complex along the north side of the highway. Continuing to the east-northeast, additional EF3 damage occurred as a convenience store was destroyed, and a nearby large metal-framed warehouse building was destroyed as well along John Allison Drive.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref> A manufactured home was overturned in this area as well. In a nearby residential area, the tornado weakened to EF2 strength as large trees were downed, and homes had large portions of their roofs torn off. Continuing to the northeast through Alexandria, the tornado narrowed and weakened to EF1 strength, damaging trees and power poles as it crossed Bayou Rapides Road. Along Enterprise Road, a warehouse building sustained EF1 damage to its roof and doors. The tornado proceeded to cross the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and entered [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]], first causing EF1 damage to structures at the Pineville Municipal Airport. The tornado moved along a northeasterly path through residential areas of Pineville, snapping and uprooting numerous large trees. Some of these trees fell onto houses and caused heavy damage. A majority of the damage in Pineville was rated EF1, though a small pocket of EF2 damage occurred along Edgewood Drive, where a house sustained considerable structural damage. Past this area, the tornado continued to narrow and weaken, eventually dissipating after producing some EF0 tree limb damage along Donahue Ferry Road in Pineville.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref>\n\nOverall, this EF3 tornado caused one fatality along its 62-mile long path.

Past the airport, the tornado caused EF0 to EF1 damage at the Dixie Golf Club, where trees and tree limbs were snapped and fencing was blown over. The tornado moved along a northeastward path through the southwest side of Laurel, downing trees and causing minor roof damage to homes. Metal roofing was torn off of a three-story motel along Jefferson street as well. Damage along this section of the path was rated EF0 to EF1 in intensity. Crossing South 16th Avenue, the tornado reached EF2 strength, where a small brick office building sustained roof and exterior wall loss, and a strip mall was heavily damaged. The roof of a hotel was lifted up and dropped back down onto the building, and a semi-truck and flatbed trailer carrying automobiles was flipped over and dragged. Continuing to the northeast through Laurel, the tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as numerous homes, warehouses, apartment buildings, and other structures sustained minor to moderate roof damage. One large building lost roughly 20% of its metal roof, and sustained collapse of brick facade. A [[Piggly Wiggly]] grocery store also sustained minor EF0 roof and exterior damage in this area as well, and numerous trees and a few power poles were downed. The tornado continued to the northeast through residential neighborhoods at EF1 intensity, snapping and uprooting trees and causing roof damage to additional homes. Some trees fell onto houses and cars as well. A metal self-storage building was partially destroyed along North 1st Avenue, and a large warehouse building near North Railroad Avenue sustained considerable roof damage. The tornado reached EF2 intensity again as moved through the eastern part of Laurel, where a house had its roof torn off and other homes sustained lesser roof damage. The Nora Davis Magnet school also lost much of its roof in this area. The tornado then reached EF3 intensity as it exited Laurel and crossed [[Interstate 59]], snapping and uprooting numerous trees, and toppling several large metal truss transmission towers to the ground. EF3 damage continued as the tornado then completely destroyed the Wade Services manufacturing plant, along with several other metal buildings and an office building on the property. Northeast of this area, the tornado momentarily weakened and caused EF1 tree damage as it moved along the east side of Interstate 59. The tornado became strong again as it then impacted the southern fringes of [[Sandersville, Mississippi|Sandersville]] at EF2 strength, where a house sustained loss of much of its roof, along with some second floor exterior walls. Another home sustained major roof damage, outbuildings were damaged or destroyed, numerous large trees were snapped or uprooted, and two people sustained minor injuries in the Sandersville area.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref> Past Sandersville, the tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as it struck the Mississippi Choctaw Reservation, where homes sustained roof and garage damage, a small pavilion collapsed, trees were downed, and headstones were tipped over at a cemetery. EF0 and EF1 damage to trees and homes continued through the extreme northwestern corner of [[Wayne County, Mississippi|Wayne County]] and into the southwestern corner of [[Clarke County, Mississippi|Clarke County]], though a small pocket of EF2 damage occurred along County Road 223, where numerous large trees were snapped and a mobile home was rolled and destroyed. Additional EF2 damage occurred as the tornado crossed [[U.S. Route 45]] north of [[Shubuta, Mississippi|Shubuta]], where a well-built home had most if its roof torn off. Northeast of Shubuta, numerous trees were snapped and uprooted at EF1 strength as the tornado moved through rural areas. A few outbuildings and mobile homes were damaged as well. A final area of EF2 damage occurred to the southwest of the small community of [[Mannassa, Mississippi|Mannassa]], where a well-built home along County Road 664 sustained destruction of its attached garage, and had a large portion of its roof torn off. A nearby mobile home was rolled and destroyed as well. Northeast of Mannassa, the tornado weakened to EF0 strength as it approached the Alabama border, causing only tree limb damage in rural areas. The tornado then regained EF1 strength as it crossed into [[Choctaw County, Alabama]], downing trees and destroying a mobile home.

Citing their advanced age, Zechariah asked with disbelief for a sign whereby he would know the truth of this prophecy. In reply, the angel identified himself as [[Gabriel]], sent especially by God to make this announcement, and added that because of Zechariah's doubt he would be struck dumb and \"not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed\".

Mary then travelled to visit her relative Elizabeth, having been told by the angel that Elizabeth was in her sixth month of pregnancy. Mary remained about three months before she returned to her own house ({{bibleverse|Luke|1:23-45|KJV}};{{bibleverse|Luke|1:56|KJV|56}}).\n\nElizabeth gave birth, and on the eighth day, when their son was to be [[circumcision|circumcised]] according to the commandment, her neighbours and relatives assumed that he was to be named after his father. Elizabeth, however, insisted that his name was to be John; so the family then questioned her husband. As soon as Zechariah had written on a writing table: \"His name is John\", he regained the power of speech, and blessed \"the Lord God of Israel\" with a [[prophecy]] known as the [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|''Benedictus'']] or \"Song of Zechariah\" ({{bibleref|Luke|1:57\u201379|9}}).

This is also recorded in the [[Infancy Gospel of James]], an [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] work from the 2nd century.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church commemorates him as a [[saint]], along with Elizabeth, on September 23.<ref>''Martyrologium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 {{ISBN|88-209-7210-7}})</ref> He is also venerated as a prophet in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|Lutheran Church]] on September 5. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] also celebrates the [[feast day]] of Zechariah [[September 5 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|on September 5]], together with [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]], who is considered a matriarch. Zechariah and Elizabeth are invoked in several prayers during the Orthodox [[Sacred Mysteries|Mystery]] [[Christian views of marriage#View of the Eastern Orthodox Church|of Crowning]] (Sacrament of Marriage), as the priest blesses the newly married couple, saying \"Thou who didst... accept Zechariah and Elizabeth, and didst make their offspring the [[John the Baptist|Forerunner]]...\" and \"...bless them, O Lord our God, as Thou didst Zechariah and Elizabeth...\". In the [[Greek Orthodox]] calendar, Zechariah and Elizabeth are also commemorated on June 24.\n\n[[Armenians]] believe that the [[Gandzasar Monastery]] in [[Nagorno Karabakh]], Azerbaijan contains relics of Zechariah.

Professor Gideon Foerster at the [[Hebrew University]] states that the inscription tallies with a 6th-century Christian text stating that Zechariah was buried with Simon the Elder and [[James the brother of Jesus]], and believes that both are authentic.<ref name=Haaretz>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=320531 Jewish Yad Avshalom revealed as a Christian shrine from Byzantine era], ''[[Haaretz]]'', July 22, 2003</ref> What makes the theory less plausible is the fact that the tomb is three centuries older than the Byzantine inscriptions, that a tomb with just two burial benches is unlikely to be used for three burials, as well as the fact that the identification of the tomb has repeatedly changed during its history.<ref name=\"ZiasPuech\">{{cite web|url= http://tfba.co/content/index.php/projects/34-tomb-of-absalom/46-the-tomb-of-absalom-reconsidered |author=[[Joe Zias]] and [[\u00c9mile Puech]] |year=2004 |title=The Tomb of Absalom Reconsidered |work= |publisher=The Foundation for Biblical Archaeology |accessdate=4 January 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==In Islam==\n[[File:Aleppo - Prophet Zakariyya.JPG|thumb|right|260px|The tomb of Zechariah within the [[Great Mosque of Aleppo]], Syria]]\n{{Islamic prophets|Prophets in the Quran}}\nZechariah ([[Arabic]]: \u0632\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0627 Zakariyy\u0101) is also a [[prophets and messengers in Islam|prophet in Islam]], and is mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] as the father of John the Baptist.

Zakariyah started to pray to God for a son. The praying for the birth of an offspring was not merely out of the desire for a child.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He prayed both for himself and for the public \u2013 they needed a messenger, a man of God who would work in the service of the Lord after Zakariyah. Zakariyah had character and virtue and he wanted to transfer this to his spiritual heir as his most precious possession. His dream was to restore the household to the posterity of the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarch]] [[Jacob]], and to make sure the message of God was renewed for Israel. As the Qur'an recounts:\n{{Quote|A mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zakariya. When he cried unto his Lord a cry in secret, saying: My Lord! Lo! the bones of me wax feeble and my head is shining with grey hair, and I have never been unblest in prayer to Thee, my Lord. Lo! I fear my kinsfolk after me, since my wife is barren. Oh, give me from Thy presence a successor who shall inherit of me and inherit (also) of the house of Jacob. And make him, my Lord, acceptable (unto Thee). {{cite quran|19|4|e=6|t=p}}}}\nAs a gift from God, Zakariyah  was given a son named ''Ya\u1e25y\u00e1'' ({{lang-ar|\u064a\u062d\u064a\u0649}}, identified with [[John the Baptist]]), a name specially chosen for this child alone. Muslim tradition narrates that Zakariyah was ninety-two years old<ref>''Historical Dictionary of Prophets In Islam and Judaism'', B. M. Wheeler, ''Zechariah, father of John''</ref> when he was told of John's birth.\n\nIn accordance with Zakariyah\u2019s  prayer, God made John renew the message of God, which had been corrupted and lost by the Israelites.<ref>{{bibleref|Luke|1:16|9}}: \"And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.\"</ref> As the Qur'an says:\n{{Quote|O Zachariah!

He points out that Yahya was a relative of Isa, while [[Elijah|Eliyas]]  was one who was present at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration of Isa]] <ref>{{bibleref|Matthew|17:3|9}}: \"And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.\"</ref> on the [[Mount of Transfiguration|Mount]], as mentioned in the New Testament. Zakariyah  meanwhile, through marriage, was the uncle of Isa and his son Yayha was referred to as Eliyas in the New Testament.<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|11:14-15|9|Matthew 11:14&ndash;15}}: \"And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.
