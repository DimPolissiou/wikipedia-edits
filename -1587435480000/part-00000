The basic version consists of three phases as follows:\n\n#Controlled hyperventilation: The first phase involves 30 cycles of breathing. Each cycle goes as follows: take a powerful breath in, fully filling the lungs. Breathe out by passively releasing the breath, but not forcefully. Repeat this cycle at a steady pace thirty times. Hof says that this form of [[hyperventilation]] may lead to [[Paresthesia|tingling sensations]] or [[Lightheadedness|light-headedness]].\n#Exhalation: After completion of the 30 cycles of controlled hyperventilation, take another deep breath in, and let it out completely. Hold the breath (with lungs empty) for as long as possible.\n#Breath retention: When strong urges to breathe occur, take a full deep breath in. Hold the breath for around 15 \u2013 20 seconds and let it go. The body may experience a normal head-rush sensation.\n\nThese three phases may be repeated for three consecutive rounds.<ref name=HofBreathing/>\n\n==Scientific investigations==\nPreliminary and proof-of-principle studies of Hof's method, as well as similar breathing practices, have shown that hyperventilating can temporarily suppress the [[innate immune response]] as well as temporarily increase heart rate and adrenaline levels.<ref name=BiologyNow>{{cite book |last1=Houtman |first1=Anne |last2=Scudellari |first2=Megan |last3=Malone |first3=Cindy |last4=Singh-Cundy |first4=Anu |chapter=22.

The Hof brothers are identical twins, but unlike Wim, Andre has a sedentary lifestyle without exposure to extreme cold. The scientists had them practice Wim's breathing exercises and then exposed them to the lowest temperature that would not induce shivering. They concluded that, \"No significant differences were found between the two subjects, indicating that a lifestyle with frequent exposures to extreme cold does not seem to affect BAT activity and CIT.\"<ref name= \"Vosselman\">{{cite journal |last1=Vosselman |first1=Maarten J. |last2=Vijgen |first2=Guy H.

However, their brown fat percentage \u2013 while high for their age \u2013 was not enough to account for all of the increase. The rest was due to their vigorous breathing, which increased the metabolic activity in their respiratory muscles. The researchers cautions that the \"results must be interpreted with caution given the low subject number and the fact that both participants practised the g-Tummo like breathing technique.\"<ref name=Lichtenbelt/>\n\nThe related [[Tummo|g-Tummo]] practice is called \"psychic heat\" practice because it is accompanied by intense sensations of heat in the spine. It involves special breathing accompanied by meditation involving mental images of flames at certain locations in the body. There are two types of breathing, \"forceful\" and \"gentle\". A scientific study found that only the forceful type results in an increase in body temperature, and that meditation was required to sustain the temperature increase.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kozhevnikov |first1=Maria |last2=Elliott |first2=James |last3=Shephard |first3=Jennifer |last4=Gramann |first4=Klaus |last5=Romanovsky |first5=Andrej A. |title=Neurocognitive and Somatic Components of Temperature Increases during g-Tummo Meditation: Legend and Reality |journal=PLOS One |date=29 March 2013 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=e58244 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0058244|pmc=3612090 |pmid=23555572}}</ref>\n\n===Immune system suppression===\nPeter Pickkers and his PhD student Matthijs Kox of the [[Radboud University Medical Center]] in the Netherlands took blood samples from Hof before and after his regimen of breathing, meditation and an 80-minute full-body ice bath, and found that afterwards he had reduced levels of proteins associated with the immune response.<ref name=BiologyNow/>\n\nPickkers and Kox injected him with an [[Lipopolysaccharide|endotoxin]] that normally would stimulate a rapid immune response. Most subjects responded with [[influenza|flu]]-like symptoms ([[fever]], [[headache]]s and shivering), with affected cells releasing signalling proteins called [[cytokine]]s. Hof, on the other hand, had no flu-like symptoms and half as many cytokines as control subjects. Moreover, later,  after he had trained some volunteers for a week, they too had reduced symptoms.<ref name=BiologyNow/>\n\nPickkers and Kox attributed the effect on the immune system to a stress-like response. In the [[hypothalamus]], stress messages from the brain trigger a release of [[adrenaline]], which increases the pumping of blood and releases [[glucose]], both of which can help the body deal with an emergency. It also suppresses the immune system. In Hof and the trained subjects, the adrenaline release was higher than it would be after a person's first bungee jump.<ref name=BiologyNow/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kox M, van Eijk LT, Zwaag J, van den Wildenberg J, GJ Sweep FC, van der Hoeven JG, Pickkers P |date=May 20, 2014 |title=Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=111 |issue=20 |pages=7379\u20137384 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1322174111 |pmc=4034215 |access-date=January 28, 2017 |pmid=24799686}}</ref> It is not yet known which part of the training (cold exposure, breathing or meditation) is primarily responsible for the effect, or whether there are long-term training effects.<ref name=Lichtenbelt/>\n\n== Controversies ==\nPeople have died while attempting the Wim Hof Method.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gezondheid.eenvandaag.nl/tv-items/67565/_iceman_onder_vuur |title='Iceman' onder vuur |first1=Fannie |last1=Tijmstra |first2=Loes |last2=Bomers |date=10 June 2016 |publisher=[[EenVandaag]] |language=Dutch |trans-title='Iceman' under fire |access-date=23 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.parool.nl/binnenland/-iceman-oefening-eist-opnieuw-leven~a4332186 |title='Iceman'-oefening eist opnieuw leven |first1=Roelf Jan |last1=Duin |date=2 July 2016 |newspaper=[[Het Parool]]|language=Dutch |trans-title='Iceman' exercise claims a new life |access-date=23 February 2019}}</ref>  Four practitioners of the WHM drowned in 2015 and 2016, and relatives suspected the breathing exercises were to blame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thatwasinsane2.blogspot.com/2020/04/i-did-wim-hof-method-for-1-week-and.html|title='Wim Hof Method'|accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://thatwasinsane2.blogspot.com/2020/04/i-did-wim-hof-method-for-1-week-and.html|title='Iceman Method' Real Experience}}</ref> The WHM website advises doing the exercises in a safe manner and location.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wimhofmethod.com/pages/practice-the-method|title=Practice the Wim Hof Method|website=Wim Hof Method|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129181133/https://www.wimhofmethod.com/pages/practice-the-method|archivedate=29 November 2016|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nCritics of Hof say he overstates the benefits of his method, giving false hope to people suffering from serious diseases, and some of his claims have been uncritically reported by the media.<ref name=trickery>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pepijnvanerp.nl/2016/01/wim-hof-method/|first=Pepijn|last=van Erp|author-link=Pepijn van Erp|title=Wim Hof's Cold Trickery|website=Pepijn van Erp|date=1 January 2016|access-date=22 February 2019}}</ref> On his website he says that it has reduced symptoms of several diseases including [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[Parkinson's disease]];<ref name=HofBreathing/> He has also said it might cure some forms of cancer.<ref name=trickery/> Wouter van Marken Lichtenbelt, one of the scientists who studied Hof, stated that \"[Hof's] scientific vocabulary is [[wiktionary:galimatias|galimatias]].

The basic version consists of three phases as follows:\n\n#Controlled hyperventilation: The first phase involves 30 cycles of breathing. Each cycle goes as follows: take a powerful breath in, fully filling the lungs. Breathe out by passively releasing the breath, but not forcefully. Repeat this cycle at a steady pace thirty times. Hof says that this form of [[hyperventilation]] may lead to [[Paresthesia|tingling sensations]] or [[Lightheadedness|light-headedness]].\n#Exhalation: After completion of the 30 cycles of controlled hyperventilation, take another deep breath in, and let it out completely. Hold the breath (with lungs empty) for as long as possible.\n#Breath retention: When strong urges to breathe occur, take a full deep breath in. Hold the breath for around 15 \u2013 20 seconds and let it go. The body may experience a normal head-rush sensation.\n\nThese three phases may be repeated for three consecutive rounds.<ref name=HofBreathing/>\n\n==Scientific investigations==\nPreliminary and proof-of-principle studies of Hof's method, as well as similar breathing practices, have shown that hyperventilating can temporarily suppress the [[innate immune response]] as well as temporarily increase heart rate and adrenaline levels.<ref name=BiologyNow>{{cite book |last1=Houtman |first1=Anne |last2=Scudellari |first2=Megan |last3=Malone |first3=Cindy |last4=Singh-Cundy |first4=Anu |chapter=22.

However, their brown fat percentage \u2013 while high for their age \u2013 was not enough to account for all of the increase. The rest was due to their vigorous breathing, which increased the metabolic activity in their respiratory muscles. The researchers cautions that the \"results must be interpreted with caution given the low subject number and the fact that both participants practised the g-Tummo like breathing technique.\"<ref name=Lichtenbelt/>\n\nThe related [[Tummo|g-Tummo]] practice is called \"psychic heat\" practice because it is accompanied by intense sensations of heat in the spine. It involves special breathing accompanied by meditation involving mental images of flames at certain locations in the body. There are two types of breathing, \"forceful\" and \"gentle\". A scientific study found that only the forceful type results in an increase in body temperature, and that meditation was required to sustain the temperature increase.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kozhevnikov |first1=Maria |last2=Elliott |first2=James |last3=Shephard |first3=Jennifer |last4=Gramann |first4=Klaus |last5=Romanovsky |first5=Andrej A. |title=Neurocognitive and Somatic Components of Temperature Increases during g-Tummo Meditation: Legend and Reality |journal=PLOS One |date=29 March 2013 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=e58244 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0058244|pmc=3612090 |pmid=23555572}}</ref>\n\n===Immune system suppression===\nPeter Pickkers and his PhD student Matthijs Kox of the [[Radboud University Medical Center]] in the Netherlands took blood samples from Hof before and after his regimen of breathing, meditation and an 80-minute full-body ice bath, and found that afterwards he had reduced levels of proteins associated with the immune response.<ref name=BiologyNow/>\n\nPickkers and Kox injected him with an [[Lipopolysaccharide|endotoxin]] that normally would stimulate a rapid immune response. Most subjects responded with [[influenza|flu]]-like symptoms ([[fever]], [[headache]]s and shivering), with affected cells releasing signalling proteins called [[cytokine]]s. Hof, on the other hand, had no flu-like symptoms and half as many cytokines as control subjects. Moreover, later,  after he had trained some volunteers for a week, they too had reduced symptoms.<ref name=BiologyNow/>\n\nPickkers and Kox attributed the effect on the immune system to a stress-like response.
