After school, he spent many hours drawing, painting or playing his guitar. On weekends, he performed at parties and local events as the lead guitarist in two different \"Cover Tune\" bands. The first band he formed was called \"The Renegades\" and the second was \"Albatross\". He graduated in 1969 from C.K.

For a moderated subform of flagellation, described as ''bastinado'', the soles of a person's [[barefoot|bare feet]] are used as a target for beating (see [[foot whipping]]).\n\nIn some circumstances the word \"flogging\" is used loosely to include any sort of [[corporal punishment]], including [[birching]] and [[caning]]. However, in British legal terminology, a distinction was drawn (and still is, in one or two colonial territories) between \"flogging\" (with a [[cat-o'-nine-tails]]) and \"whipping\" (formerly with a whip, but since the early 19th century with a birch). In Britain these were both abolished in 1948.\n\n==Current use as punishment==\n{{main|Judicial corporal punishment}}\nOfficially abolished in most Western countries, flogging or whipping, including [[foot whipping]] in some countries, is still a common punishment in some parts of the world, particularly in [[Application of Islamic law by country|countries using Islamic law]] and in some territories formerly under British rule. Medically supervised [[caning]] is routinely ordered by the courts as a penalty for some categories of crime in [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Caning in Brunei|Brunei]], [[Caning in Malaysia|Malaysia]], Indonesia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and elsewhere.\n\nFlogging is a form of punishment used under Islamic [[Sharia]] law. It is the prescribed punishment (''[[hudud]]'') for offences including [[fornication]], alcohol use and slander and is also widely favoured as a discretionary punishment (''[[ta'zir]]'') for many offences, such as violating gender interaction laws (''[[zina]]''). Punishment is normally carried out in public. However, some scholars maintain that this goes against the teachings of Islam.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://islamqa.info/en/ref/72338/rape |title=Ruling on the crime of rape |date=9 January 2012}}</ref>\n[[Image:Prisoners whipped.jpg|thumb|200px|Prisoners at a whipping post in a [[Delaware]] prison, circa 1907]]\n\n==Historical use as punishment ==\n[[File:Johann Moritz Rugendas in Brazil.jpg|thumb|250px|Public flogging of a slave in [[Brazil]] - work of German painter [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]] (1802\u20131858).]]\n\n===Judaism===\n{{Main|Corporal punishment (Judaism)}}\n\nAccording to the [[Torah]] (Deuteronomy 25:1-3)  and [[Rabbinic law]] lashes may be given for offenses that do not merit capital punishment, and may not exceed 40. However, in the absence of a [[Sanhedrin]], corporal punishment is not practiced in Jewish law. [[Halakha]] specifies the lashes must be given in sets of three, so the total number cannot exceed 39. Also, the person whipped is first judged whether they can withstand the punishment, if not, the number of whips is decreased. [[Halakha|Jewish law]] limited flagellation to forty strokes, and in practice delivered thirty-nine, so as to avoid any possibility of breaking this law due to a miscount.\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nIn [[Sparta]], young men were flogged as a test of their masculinity.\n\nIn the [[Roman Empire]], flagellation was often used as a prelude to [[crucifixion]], and in this context is sometimes referred to as '''[[Scourge|scourging]]'''. Most famously according to the gospel accounts, [[Flagellation of Christ|this occurred]] prior to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion of Jesus Christ]].\n\nWhips with small pieces of metal or bone at the tips were commonly used. Such a device could easily cause disfigurement and serious trauma, such as ripping pieces of flesh from the body or loss of an eye. In addition to causing severe pain, the victim would approach a state of [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]] due to loss of blood.\n\nThe Romans reserved this treatment for non-citizens, as stated in the ''lex Porcia'' and ''lex Sempronia'', dating from 195 and 123 BC. The poet [[Horace]] refers to the ''horribile flagellum'' (horrible whip) in his ''Satires''. Typically, the one to be punished was stripped naked and bound to a low pillar so that he could bend over it, or chained to an upright pillar so as to be stretched out. Two [[lictor]]s (some reports indicate scourgings with four or six lictors) alternated blows from the bare shoulders down the body to the soles of the feet. There was no limit to the number of blows inflicted&mdash;this was left to the lictors to decide, though they were normally not supposed to kill the victim. Nonetheless, [[Livy]], [[Suetonius]] and [[Josephus]] report cases of flagellation where victims died while still bound to the post. Flagellation was referred to as \"half death\" by some authors, as many victims died shortly thereafter. [[Cicero]] reports in ''In Verrem'', ''\"{{lang|la|pro mortuo sublatus brevi postea mortuus}}\"'' (\"taken away for a dead man, shortly thereafter he was dead\").\n\n===From Middle Ages to modern times===\n[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|Punishment with a [[knout]]. Russia, 18th century.]]\nThe Whipping Act was passed in [[England]] in 1530. Under this legislation, [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]s were to be taken to a nearby populated area \"and there tied to the end of a cart naked and beaten with whips throughout such market town till the body shall be bloody\".<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Whipping|volume=28|pages=590\u2013591}}</ref>\n\nIn England, offenders (mostly those convicted of theft) were usually sentenced to be flogged \"at a cart's tail\" along a length of public street, usually near the scene of the crime, \"until his [or her] back be bloody\". In the late seventeenth century, however, the courts occasionally ordered that the flogging should be carried out in prison or a [[house of correction]] rather than on the streets. From the 1720s courts began explicitly to differentiate between private whipping and public whipping. Over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the proportion of whippings carried out in public declined, but the number of private whippings increased. The public whipping of women was abolished in 1817 (after having been in decline since the 1770s) and that of men ended in the early 1830s, though not formally abolished until 1862. Private whipping of men in prison continued and was not abolished until 1948.<ref>[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Punishment.jsp#corporal London lives]</ref> The 1948 abolition did not affect the ability of a prison's visiting justices (in England and Wales, but not in Scotland, except at Peterhead) to order the birch or cat for prisoners committing serious assaults on prison staff. This power was not abolished until 1967, having been last used in 1962.<ref>[https://www.corpun.com/counukj.htm]</ref>\n\nWhipping occurred during the French Revolution, though not as official punishment. On 31 May 1793, the Jacobin women seized a revolutionary leader, [[Anne Josephe Theroigne de Mericourt]], stripped her naked, and flogged her on the bare bottom in the public garden of the [[Tuileries]].  After this humiliation, she refused to wear any clothes, in memory of the outrage she had suffered.<ref>Roudinesco, Elisabeth (1992). ''Madness and Revolution: The Lives and Legends of Theroigne de Mericourt'', Verso. {{ISBN|0-86091-597-2}}. p.198</ref> She went mad and ended her days in an asylum after the public whipping.\n\nIn the [[Russian Empire]], [[knout]]s were used to flog criminals and political offenders. Sentences of a hundred lashes would usually result in death. Whipping was used as a punishment for [[Serfdom in Russia|Russian serfs]].<ref>Chapman, Tim (2001).

The scars are clearly visible because of [[keloid]] formation.]]\n\nWhipping has been used as a form of discipline on slaves. It was frequently carried out during the period of [[slavery in the United States]], by slave owners and their slaves. The power was also given to slave \"patrollers,\" mostly poor whites, who had among their powers the ability to whip any slave who violated the [[slave codes]].\n\n===Flogging as military punishment===\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, European armies administered floggings to common soldiers who committed breaches of the military code.\n\n====United States====\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]], the American Congress raised the legal limit on lashes from 39 to 100 for soldiers who were convicted by courts-martial.<ref>Martin, p 76.</ref> Generally, officers were not flogged.

In severe cases a person could be \"flogged around the fleet\": a significant number of lashes (up to 600) was divided among the ships on a station and the person was taken to all ships to be flogged on each.<ref>Keith Grint, The Arts of Leadership, 2000, {{ISBN|0191589330}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rJ6yjNy___AC&pg=PA238, pp.237-238]</ref>\n\nIn June 1879 a motion to abolish flogging in the Royal Navy was debated in the House of Commons. [[John O'Connor Power]], the member for Mayo, asked the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] to bring the navy cat-of-nine-tails to the [[House of Commons Library|Commons Library]] so that the members might see what they were voting about.  It was the Great \"Cat\" Contention, \"Mr Speaker, since the Government has let the cat out of the bag, there is nothing to be done but to take the bull by the horns.\" [[Poet Laureate]] [[Ted Hughes]] celebrates the occasion in his poem, \"Wilfred Owen's Photographs\": \"A witty profound Irishman calls/For a 'cat' into the House, and sits to watch/The gentry fingering its stained tails./Whereupon ...Quietly, unopposed,/The motion was passed.\"<ref>Hughes, Ted, \"Wilfred Owen's Photographs\", ''Lupercal'', 1960.

This many lashes could permanently disable or kill a man. [[Charles Oman]], historian of the [[Peninsular War]], noted that the maximum sentence was inflicted \"nine or ten times by general court-martial during the whole six years of the war\" and that 1,000 lashes were administered about 50 times.<ref>Oman, p 239.</ref> Other sentences were for 900, 700, 500 and 300 lashes. One soldier was sentenced to 700 lashes for stealing a beehive.<ref>Oman, p 246.</ref> Another man was let off after only 175 of 400 lashes, but spent three weeks in the hospital.<ref>Oman, p 254.</ref> Later in the war, the more draconian punishments were abandoned and the offenders shipped to New South Wales instead, where more whippings often awaited them. (See [[Flagellation#Australian penal colonies|Australian penal colonies]] section.) Oman later wrote: {{quote|If anything was calculated to brutalize an army it was the wicked cruelty of the British military punishment code, which [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] to the end of his life supported. There is plenty of authority for the fact that the man who had once received his 500 lashes for a fault which was small, or which involved no moral guilt, was often turned thereby from a good soldier into a bad soldier, by losing his self-respect and having his sense of justice seared out. Good officers knew this well enough, and did their best to avoid the cat-of-nine-tails, and to try more rational means{{mdash}}more often than not with success.<ref>Oman, p.43.</ref>}}\n\nThe 3rd battalion's [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] nickname of \"The Steelbacks\" is taken from one of its former regiments, the [[48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot]] who earned the nickname for their stoicism when being flogged with the cat-o'-nine tails (\"Not a whimper under the lash\"), a routine method of administering punishment in the Army in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\n====France====\nMeanwhile, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] the French Army stopped floggings altogether. The [[King's German Legion]] (KGL), which were German units in British pay, did not flog. In one case, a British soldier on detached duty with the KGL was sentenced to be flogged, but the German commander refused to carry out the punishment. When the British 73rd Foot flogged a man in occupied France in 1814, disgusted French citizens protested against it.<ref>Rothenberg, p.179.</ref>\n\n====Singapore====\n{{Main|Caning in Singapore}}\nOne of few countries where corporal punishment is still officially used in the armed forces is [[Singapore]], where military legislation provides that errant soldiers can be sentenced by court-martial to strokes of the cane. It is also used for crimes including but not limited to rape, vandalism and molestation etc.\n\n=== Australian penal colonies ===\n[[File:FremantletPrisonWhippingPost 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|[[Fremantle Prison]] whipping post.]]\n{{See also|History of Australia}}\n\nOnce common in the [[British Army]] and British [[Royal Navy]] as a means of discipline, flagellation also featured prominently in the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] in [[early colonial Australia]]. Given that convicts in Australia were already \"imprisoned\", punishments for offenses committed there could not usually result in imprisonment and thus usually consisted of corporal punishment such as [[hard labour]] or flagellation. Unlike Roman times, British law explicitly forbade the combination of corporal and [[capital punishment]]; thus, a convict was either flogged or hanged but never both.\n\nFlagellation took place either with a single whip or, more notoriously, with the [[cat o' nine tails]]. Typically, the offender's upper half was bared and he was suspended by the wrists beneath a tripod of wooden beams (known as 'the triangle').  In many cases, the offender's feet barely touched ground, which helped to stretch the skin taut and increase the damage inflicted by the whip.  It also centered the offender's weight in his shoulders, further ensuring a painful experience.\n\nWith the prisoner thus stripped and bound, either one or two floggers administered the prescribed number of strokes, or \"lashes,\" to the victim's back. During the flogging, a doctor or other medical worker was consulted at regular intervals as to the condition of the prisoner.  In many cases, however, the physician merely observed the offender to determine whether he was conscious.  If the prisoner passed out, the physician would order a halt until the prisoner was revived, and then the whipping would continue.\n\nFemale convicts were also subject to flogging as punishment, both on the convict ships and in the penal colonies. Although they were generally given fewer lashes than males (usually limited to 40 in each flogging), there was no other difference between the manner in which males and females were flogged.\n\nFloggings of both male and female convicts were public, administered before the whole colony's company, assembled especially for the purpose.  In addition to the infliction of pain, one of the principal purposes of the flogging was to humiliate the offender in front of his mates and to demonstrate, in a forceful way, that he had been required to submit to authority.\n\nAt the conclusion of the whipping, the prisoner's lacerated back was normally rinsed with [[brine]], which served as a crude and painful disinfectant.\n\nFlogging still continued for years after independence. The last person flogged in Australia was [[William John O'Meally]] in 1958 in [[Melbourne]]'s [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]].\n\n=== Contemporary Syria ===\nIn [[Syria]] where torture of [[political dissent |Political Dissents]], [[Prisoners of War |POWs]] and [[Civilians]] is common,<ref>https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/12/16/if-dead-could-speak/mass-deaths-and-torture-syrias-detention-facilities</ref><ref>https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5135217/brutal-torture-in-syrian-prison-network-detailed-by-new-york-times-investigation-1.5135802</ref> flagellation has become one of the most common forms of [[Torture]].<ref>http://sn4hr.org/wp-content/pdf/english/Documentation_of_72_Torture_Methods_the_Syrian_Regime_Continues_to_Practice_in_Its_Detention_Centers_and_Military_Hospitals_en.pdf</ref> Flagellation is used by both the [[Free Syrian Army]]<ref>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3423292/Moderate-Syrian-rebel-fighters-filmed-carrying-public-flogging-three-men-accused-harassing-women-Idlib.html</ref><ref>https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/09/17/syria-end-opposition-use-torture-executions</ref>, and by the [[Syrian Arab Army]]<ref>https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/rare-video-evidence-of-torture-in-syrian-hospitals/</ref>, however is not practiced by the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]]<ref>https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/06/18/syria-abuses-kurdish-run-enclaves</ref>.

For a moderated subform of flagellation, described as ''bastinado'', the soles of a person's [[barefoot|bare feet]] are used as a target for beating (see [[foot whipping]]).\n\nIn some circumstances the word \"flogging\" is used loosely to include any sort of [[corporal punishment]], including [[birching]] and [[caning]]. However, in British legal terminology, a distinction was drawn (and still is, in one or two colonial territories) between \"flogging\" (with a [[cat-o'-nine-tails]]) and \"whipping\" (formerly with a whip, but since the early 19th century with a birch). In Britain these were both abolished in 1948.\n\n==Current use as punishment==\n{{main|Judicial corporal punishment}}\nOfficially abolished in most Western countries, flogging or whipping, including [[foot whipping]] in some countries, is still a common punishment in some parts of the world, particularly in [[Application of Islamic law by country|countries using Islamic law]] and in some territories formerly under British rule. Medically supervised [[caning]] is routinely ordered by the courts as a penalty for some categories of crime in [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Caning in Brunei|Brunei]], [[Caning in Malaysia|Malaysia]], Indonesia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and elsewhere.\n\nFlogging is a form of punishment used under Islamic [[Sharia]] law. It is the prescribed punishment (''[[hudud]]'') for offences including [[fornication]], alcohol use and slander and is also widely favoured as a discretionary punishment (''[[ta'zir]]'') for many offences, such as violating gender interaction laws (''[[zina]]''). Punishment is normally carried out in public. However, some scholars maintain that this goes against the teachings of Islam.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://islamqa.info/en/ref/72338/rape |title=Ruling on the crime of rape |date=9 January 2012}}</ref>\n[[Image:Prisoners whipped.jpg|thumb|200px|Prisoners at a whipping post in a [[Delaware]] prison, circa 1907]]\n\n==Historical use as punishment ==\n[[File:Johann Moritz Rugendas in Brazil.jpg|thumb|250px|Public flogging of a slave in [[Brazil]] - work of German painter [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]] (1802\u20131858).]]\n\n===Judaism===\n{{Main|Corporal punishment (Judaism)}}\n\nAccording to the [[Torah]] (Deuteronomy 25:1-3)  and [[Rabbinic law]] lashes may be given for offenses that do not merit capital punishment, and may not exceed 40. However, in the absence of a [[Sanhedrin]], corporal punishment is not practiced in Jewish law. [[Halakha]] specifies the lashes must be given in sets of three, so the total number cannot exceed 39. Also, the person whipped is first judged whether they can withstand the punishment, if not, the number of whips is decreased. [[Halakha|Jewish law]] limited flagellation to forty strokes, and in practice delivered thirty-nine, so as to avoid any possibility of breaking this law due to a miscount.\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nIn [[Sparta]], young men were flogged as a test of their masculinity.\n\nIn the [[Roman Empire]], flagellation was often used as a prelude to [[crucifixion]], and in this context is sometimes referred to as '''[[Scourge|scourging]]'''. Most famously according to the gospel accounts, [[Flagellation of Christ|this occurred]] prior to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion of Jesus Christ]].\n\nWhips with small pieces of metal or bone at the tips were commonly used. Such a device could easily cause disfigurement and serious trauma, such as ripping pieces of flesh from the body or loss of an eye. In addition to causing severe pain, the victim would approach a state of [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]] due to loss of blood.\n\nThe Romans reserved this treatment for non-citizens, as stated in the ''lex Porcia'' and ''lex Sempronia'', dating from 195 and 123 BC. The poet [[Horace]] refers to the ''horribile flagellum'' (horrible whip) in his ''Satires''. Typically, the one to be punished was stripped naked and bound to a low pillar so that he could bend over it, or chained to an upright pillar so as to be stretched out. Two [[lictor]]s (some reports indicate scourgings with four or six lictors) alternated blows from the bare shoulders down the body to the soles of the feet. There was no limit to the number of blows inflicted&mdash;this was left to the lictors to decide, though they were normally not supposed to kill the victim. Nonetheless, [[Livy]], [[Suetonius]] and [[Josephus]] report cases of flagellation where victims died while still bound to the post. Flagellation was referred to as \"half death\" by some authors, as many victims died shortly thereafter. [[Cicero]] reports in ''In Verrem'', ''\"{{lang|la|pro mortuo sublatus brevi postea mortuus}}\"'' (\"taken away for a dead man, shortly thereafter he was dead\").\n\n===From Middle Ages to modern times===\n[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|Punishment with a [[knout]]. Russia, 18th century.]]\nThe Whipping Act was passed in [[England]] in 1530. Under this legislation, [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]s were to be taken to a nearby populated area \"and there tied to the end of a cart naked and beaten with whips throughout such market town till the body shall be bloody\".<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Whipping|volume=28|pages=590\u2013591}}</ref>\n\nIn England, offenders (mostly those convicted of theft) were usually sentenced to be flogged \"at a cart's tail\" along a length of public street, usually near the scene of the crime, \"until his [or her] back be bloody\". In the late seventeenth century, however, the courts occasionally ordered that the flogging should be carried out in prison or a [[house of correction]] rather than on the streets. From the 1720s courts began explicitly to differentiate between private whipping and public whipping. Over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the proportion of whippings carried out in public declined, but the number of private whippings increased. The public whipping of women was abolished in 1817 (after having been in decline since the 1770s) and that of men ended in the early 1830s, though not formally abolished until 1862. Private whipping of men in prison continued and was not abolished until 1948.<ref>[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Punishment.jsp#corporal London lives]</ref> The 1948 abolition did not affect the ability of a prison's visiting justices (in England and Wales, but not in Scotland, except at Peterhead) to order the birch or cat for prisoners committing serious assaults on prison staff. This power was not abolished until 1967, having been last used in 1962.<ref>[https://www.corpun.com/counukj.htm]</ref>\n\nWhipping occurred during the French Revolution, though not as official punishment. On 31 May 1793, the Jacobin women seized a revolutionary leader, [[Anne Josephe Theroigne de Mericourt]], stripped her naked, and flogged her on the bare bottom in the public garden of the [[Tuileries]].  After this humiliation, she refused to wear any clothes, in memory of the outrage she had suffered.<ref>Roudinesco, Elisabeth (1992). ''Madness and Revolution: The Lives and Legends of Theroigne de Mericourt'', Verso. {{ISBN|0-86091-597-2}}. p.198</ref> She went mad and ended her days in an asylum after the public whipping.\n\nIn the [[Russian Empire]], [[knout]]s were used to flog criminals and political offenders. Sentences of a hundred lashes would usually result in death. Whipping was used as a punishment for [[Serfdom in Russia|Russian serfs]].<ref>Chapman, Tim (2001).

The scars are clearly visible because of [[keloid]] formation.]]\n\nWhipping has been used as a form of discipline on slaves. It was frequently carried out during the period of [[slavery in the United States]], by slave owners and their slaves. The power was also given to slave \"patrollers,\" mostly poor whites, who had among their powers the ability to whip any slave who violated the [[slave codes]].\n\n===Flogging as military punishment===\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, European armies administered floggings to common soldiers who committed breaches of the military code.\n\n====United States====\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]], the American Congress raised the legal limit on lashes from 39 to 100 for soldiers who were convicted by courts-martial.<ref>Martin, p 76.</ref> Generally, officers were not flogged.

It was the Great \"Cat\" Contention, \"Mr Speaker, since the Government has let the cat out of the bag, there is nothing to be done but to take the bull by the horns.\" [[Poet Laureate]] [[Ted Hughes]] celebrates the occasion in his poem, \"Wilfred Owen's Photographs\": \"A witty profound Irishman calls/For a 'cat' into the House, and sits to watch/The gentry fingering its stained tails./Whereupon ...Quietly, unopposed,/The motion was passed.\"<ref>Hughes, Ted, \"Wilfred Owen's Photographs\", ''Lupercal'', 1960.

This many lashes could permanently disable or kill a man. [[Charles Oman]], historian of the [[Peninsular War]], noted that the maximum sentence was inflicted \"nine or ten times by general court-martial during the whole six years of the war\" and that 1,000 lashes were administered about 50 times.<ref>Oman, p 239.</ref> Other sentences were for 900, 700, 500 and 300 lashes. One soldier was sentenced to 700 lashes for stealing a beehive.<ref>Oman, p 246.</ref> Another man was let off after only 175 of 400 lashes, but spent three weeks in the hospital.<ref>Oman, p 254.</ref> Later in the war, the more draconian punishments were abandoned and the offenders shipped to New South Wales instead, where more whippings often awaited them. (See [[Flagellation#Australian penal colonies|Australian penal colonies]] section.) Oman later wrote: {{quote|If anything was calculated to brutalize an army it was the wicked cruelty of the British military punishment code, which [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] to the end of his life supported. There is plenty of authority for the fact that the man who had once received his 500 lashes for a fault which was small, or which involved no moral guilt, was often turned thereby from a good soldier into a bad soldier, by losing his self-respect and having his sense of justice seared out. Good officers knew this well enough, and did their best to avoid the cat-of-nine-tails, and to try more rational means{{mdash}}more often than not with success.<ref>Oman, p.43.</ref>}}\n\nThe 3rd battalion's [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] nickname of \"The Steelbacks\" is taken from one of its former regiments, the [[48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot]] who earned the nickname for their stoicism when being flogged with the cat-o'-nine tails (\"Not a whimper under the lash\"), a routine method of administering punishment in the Army in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\n====France====\nMeanwhile, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] the French Army stopped floggings altogether. The [[King's German Legion]] (KGL), which were German units in British pay, did not flog. In one case, a British soldier on detached duty with the KGL was sentenced to be flogged, but the German commander refused to carry out the punishment. When the British 73rd Foot flogged a man in occupied France in 1814, disgusted French citizens protested against it.<ref>Rothenberg, p.179.</ref>\n\n====Singapore====\n{{Main|Caning in Singapore}}\nOne of few countries where corporal punishment is still officially used in the armed forces is [[Singapore]], where military legislation provides that errant soldiers can be sentenced by court-martial to strokes of the cane. It is also used for crimes including but not limited to rape, vandalism and molestation etc.\n\n=== Australian penal colonies ===\n[[File:FremantletPrisonWhippingPost 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|[[Fremantle Prison]] whipping post.]]\n{{See also|History of Australia}}\n\nOnce common in the [[British Army]] and British [[Royal Navy]] as a means of discipline, flagellation also featured prominently in the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] in [[early colonial Australia]]. Given that convicts in Australia were already \"imprisoned\", punishments for offenses committed there could not usually result in imprisonment and thus usually consisted of corporal punishment such as [[hard labour]] or flagellation. Unlike Roman times, British law explicitly forbade the combination of corporal and [[capital punishment]]; thus, a convict was either flogged or hanged but never both.\n\nFlagellation took place either with a single whip or, more notoriously, with the [[cat o' nine tails]]. Typically, the offender's upper half was bared and he was suspended by the wrists beneath a tripod of wooden beams (known as 'the triangle').  In many cases, the offender's feet barely touched ground, which helped to stretch the skin taut and increase the damage inflicted by the whip.  It also centered the offender's weight in his shoulders, further ensuring a painful experience.\n\nWith the prisoner thus stripped and bound, either one or two floggers administered the prescribed number of strokes, or \"lashes,\" to the victim's back. During the flogging, a doctor or other medical worker was consulted at regular intervals as to the condition of the prisoner.  In many cases, however, the physician merely observed the offender to determine whether he was conscious.  If the prisoner passed out, the physician would order a halt until the prisoner was revived, and then the whipping would continue.\n\nFemale convicts were also subject to flogging as punishment, both on the convict ships and in the penal colonies. Although they were generally given fewer lashes than males (usually limited to 40 in each flogging), there was no other difference between the manner in which males and females were flogged.\n\nFloggings of both male and female convicts were public, administered before the whole colony's company, assembled especially for the purpose.  In addition to the infliction of pain, one of the principal purposes of the flogging was to humiliate the offender in front of his mates and to demonstrate, in a forceful way, that he had been required to submit to authority.\n\nAt the conclusion of the whipping, the prisoner's lacerated back was normally rinsed with [[brine]], which served as a crude and painful disinfectant.\n\nFlogging still continued for years after independence. The last person flogged in Australia was [[William John O'Meally]] in 1958 in [[Melbourne]]'s [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]].\n\n=== Contemporary Syria ===\nIn [[Syria]] where torture of [[political dissent |Political Dissents]], [[Prisoners of War |POWs]] and [[Civilians]] is common,<ref>https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/12/16/if-dead-could-speak/mass-deaths-and-torture-syrias-detention-facilities</ref><ref>https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5135217/brutal-torture-in-syrian-prison-network-detailed-by-new-york-times-investigation-1.5135802</ref> flagellation has become one of the most common forms of [[Torture]]<ref>http://sn4hr.org/wp-content/pdf/english/Documentation_of_72_Torture_Methods_the_Syrian_Regime_Continues_to_Practice_in_Its_Detention_Centers_and_Military_Hospitals_en.pdf</ref>.
