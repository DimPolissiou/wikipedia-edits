He built it as a wedding present for his daughter Eleanor on her marriage as second wife to Congressman [[Joseph Pearson (politician)|Joseph Pearson]], and it stood for a hundred years before burning down in 1917.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Brentwood-DC.jpg|thumb|left|13th Pl. and Bryant St. NE, Brentwood, in February 2019]]\n\nThe mansion stood on a large expanse of land, a farm owned by Mayor Brent, that also went to Eleanor. Congressman Pearson also purchased additional properties and expanded the estate further. The property then known as Brentwood was larger than the present neighborhood known as Brentwood. Images of the mansion may be found in the book ''Capital Losses: A Cultural History of Washington's Destroyed Buildings'' by James W. Goode, and in several books in the collection of the Historical Society of Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historydc.org/ |title=Home Page &#124; The Historical Society of Washington, D.C |publisher=Historydc.org |accessdate=2012-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208005952/http://www.historydc.org/ |archivedate=2014-02-08 }}</ref>  A descendant (Edward Sisson) of the family that owned the mansion throughout its existence has posted a collection of paintings, drawings, photos, and histories of the mansion on-line in an \"album\" titled \"Worthington House and Brentwood Mansion\" on a Mac Web Gallery site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gallery.mac.com/sissoed#gallery |title=Not found |publisher=Gallery.mac.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  The Frick Art Reference Library<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frick.org/ |title=The Frick Collection |publisher=Frick.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}</ref> has drawings, paintings, and perhaps photographs (although none appear to be accessible on-line as of late 2007). On the Web, a small drawing of the mansion, together with a brief description of its owners in 1873, Capt. and Mrs. [[Carlile Pollock Patterson]], may be found in \"Washington Outside and Inside\" by George Alfred Townsend, at page 620, searchable as a Google book.\n\nThe design of Brentwood Mansion has traditionally been ascribed to the Capitol's architect, [[Benjamin Latrobe]]. The definitive 2006 book, ''The Domestic Architecture of Benjamin Henry Latrobe'', by Michael W. Fazio and Patrick Alexander Snadon (who call the house the Pearson House), states that this is uncertain. At the time of the house's design, Latrobe was suffering family troubles and his records for this period are poor.\n\nDuring the administration of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (1869-1877), Brentwood Mansion was a center of Washington social life, with many parties hosted by Elizabeth (Eliza) Worthington Patterson (daughter of Joseph Pearson and his third wife Catherine Worthington Pearson) and her husband [[Carlile Pollock Patterson]]. Patterson had known Grant since 1852; Patterson's brother-in-law [[David Dixon Porter]], married to Patterson's sister George Ann, was the highest-ranking Admiral in the US Navy; and Patterson's brother [[Thomas H. Patterson]] was commander of the Washington Navy Yard (1873-1876) before becoming the Rear Admiral in command of the [[Asiatic Squadron]] (1877-1880). Patterson Street, N.E., which is adjacent to the property, was probably named for the Patterson family.\n\nC.P. Patterson, a Naval officer and ship captain turned scientist and administrator of a government department, had neither the interest nor the aptitude to manage the transformation of a large rural farming and forest property into an urbanized part of the city growing around it. After C.P. Patterson's death in 1881, long-delayed financial problems came to a head, and on June 6, 1884, three years after Patterson's death, Congress enacted a private bill, House bill No. 4689, entitled \"An act for the relief of Eliza W. Patterson,\" C.P. Patterson's widow, excusing accumulated District of Columbia property taxes on the Patterson land. President [[Chester A. Arthur]] neither signed nor vetoed the bill, but held it ten days and allowed it to become law without his signature. In a message dated June 21, 1884, the President explained \"I do not question the constitutional right of Congress to pass a law relieving the family of an officer, in view of the services he had rendered his country, from the burdens of taxation, but I submit to Congress that this just gift of the nation to the family of such faithful officer should come from the National Treasury rather than from that of this District, and I therefore recommend that an appropriation be made to reimburse the District for the amount of taxes which would have been due to it had this act not become a law.\"\n\nAfter five more years of drift in management of the property, in March 1889, Patterson's son-in-law, Lt. Francis Winslow (II) USN (oldest brother of future Rear Admiral [[Cameron Winslow]]), after 19 years of Naval service during the slow-promotion post-war years, resigned from the Navy to devote himself to subdividing, renting, developing, and selling portions of the property. He was successful. A portion of this property later became the subject of a lawsuit that reached the United States Supreme Court, Francis Winslow v. Baltimore & Ohio RR Co., 188 U.S. 646 (1903),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/188/646/case.html |title=Winslow v. Baltimore & Ohio R.

The suit, which the Patterson/Winslow family won, involved renewal of a lease of some of the land to a railroad. (Winslow (II) also developed an expertise in oysters, having led government surveys in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s. A \"google\" search on \"Francis Winslow\" and \"oyster\" returns dozens of \"hits,\" referring to the Francis Winslow who managed the Brentwood property. His work is still cited today (2007) as authoritative and accurate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ocracokepreservation.org/id39.html |title=Home |publisher=Ocracokepreservation.org |accessdate=2012-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209110305/http://www.ocracokepreservation.org/id39.html |archive-date=2012-02-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Winslow was also a leader of US government survey expeditions in Nicaragua, studying potential routes for a canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific.).\n\nThe death of Francis Winslow (II) in 1908, suspected to have been caused by illnesses contracted in the Nicaraguan jungle, led to another period of drift in the management of the property as his four sons pursued other careers. In 1917, 100 years after it was built, the vacant Brentwood Mansion burned, and the land became the site of a World War I Army staging camp, Camp Meigs. Three of Francis Winslow (II)'s sons were officers in World War I, and they may have staged in that camp, on their own family land. In 1919 the partially burnt house was finally demolished. Part of the property became the first lumberyard for the building supply and hardware company Hechinger Co., a store that was prominent in Washington into the 1990s.\n\nIn the 1920s, Lt. Winslow's son, Francis Winslow (III), ended his career as a mining engineer and took over active management of the Brentwood Patterson/Winslow land. His most notable achievement was the development of the [[Union Market]]. For years called the Florida Avenue Market, it still operates after 80 years as the city's principal wholesale food and produce market.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.anc6a.org/FLaveMarketStudy.pdf |title=Florida Avenue Market Study |access-date=2007-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128212512/http://www.anc6a.org/FLaveMarketStudy.pdf |archive-date=2007-11-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \n\nIn the early 1940s, the District of Columbia used eminent domain to acquire a large parcel of the Patterson land known as \"square 710\", on which stands the new headquarters of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (200 Florida Avenue, N.E.). The seizure of square 710 led to a suit by Winslow (III) as trustee, asserting that the compensation offered by the District was inadequate. Winslow won the suit and a judgment for a larger sum, whereupon, according to the family, the District informed him that it simply didn't have the money to pay the larger judgment. Regardless of payment or nonpayment, title had vested in the government. At about this time, Winslow was demoralized by the death of his 17-year-old daughter in a 1946 car accident, and was then diagnosed with cancer. He died in 1948.\n\nHis youngest brother Cameron, an insurance executive in Hartford, CT, stepped in as trustee, but it is unclear whether either Francis or Cameron ever received payment from the government of the court-ordered price of \"square 710.\" If not, there may be the ironic situation of a government law-enforcement agency headquarters located on land for which the government did not comply with the law by paying the lawful price. Cameron Winslow, determining that no one in the next generation appeared interested in managing the property, and unable to manage the properties day-to-day from Hartford, began selling all remaining parts of the property in the 1950s, completing the last of the sales in the 1960s, breaking up the landed estate that Robert Brent had assembled some 200 years before.\n\nOver the decades, much of the land was acquired by or donated to [[Gallaudet University]], a prominent school for the deaf. Cogswell Hall, a residence hall of Gallaudet University, is said to be built on the site of the old Brentwood Mansion. According to a website on Washington ghost stories, students have reported that it is haunted by the spirit of a little girl. Allegedly, blankets have been yanked off, an unplugged alarm clock went off, papers have moved with no draft or breeze, there are feelings of being watched, and at least one student has been tapped awake with no one there.\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe Brentwood and Bloomingdale neighborhoods are low-lying areas, located at the foot of hills a few blocks north.  Because of this, flash flooding can occur during the spring and summer downpours which are common in Washington. Current storm drains are not adequate, resulting in submerged vehicles and filled-up basement apartments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wtop.com/41/3018850/Councilmember-Relief-fund-needed-for-victims-of-Sundays-flooding|title=Councilmember: Relief fund needed for victims of Sunday's flooding |publisher=wtop.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref>\n\n==Brentwood today==\n[[File:Rhode Island Avenue-Brentwood Station.jpg|thumb|200px|Rhode Island Avenue-Brentwood Station of the [[Washington Metro]]]] \nBrentwood neighborhood as it is today (whose boundaries are somewhat different than the original Brent property, as increased by Pearson) is trapezoidal in its geography.

His work is still cited today (2007) as authoritative and accurate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ocracokepreservation.org/id39.html |title=Home |publisher=Ocracokepreservation.org |accessdate=2012-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209110305/http://www.ocracokepreservation.org/id39.html |archive-date=2012-02-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Winslow was also a leader of US government survey expeditions in Nicaragua, studying potential routes for a canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific.).\n\nThe death of Francis Winslow (II) in 1908, suspected to have been caused by illnesses contracted in the Nicaraguan jungle, led to another period of drift in the management of the property as his four sons pursued other careers. In 1917, 100 years after it was built, the vacant Brentwood Mansion burned, and the land became the site of a World War I Army staging camp, Camp Meigs. Three of Francis Winslow (II)'s sons were officers in World War I, and they may have staged in that camp, on their own family land. In 1919 the partially burnt house was finally demolished. Part of the property became the first lumberyard for the building supply and hardware company Hechinger Co., a store that was prominent in Washington into the 1990s.\n\nIn the 1920s, Lt. Winslow's son, Francis Winslow (III), ended his career as a mining engineer and took over active management of the Brentwood Patterson/Winslow land. His most notable achievement was the development of the [[Union Market]]. For years called the Florida Avenue Market, it still operates after 80 years as the city's principal wholesale food and produce market.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.anc6a.org/FLaveMarketStudy.pdf |title=Florida Avenue Market Study |access-date=2007-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128212512/http://www.anc6a.org/FLaveMarketStudy.pdf |archive-date=2007-11-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \n\nIn the early 1940s, the District of Columbia used eminent domain to acquire a large parcel of the Patterson land known as \"square 710\", on which stands the new headquarters of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (200 Florida Avenue, N.E.). The seizure of square 710 led to a suit by Winslow (III) as trustee, asserting that the compensation offered by the District was inadequate. Winslow won the suit and a judgment for a larger sum, whereupon, according to the family, the District informed him that it simply didn't have the money to pay the larger judgment. Regardless of payment or nonpayment, title had vested in the government. At about this time, Winslow was demoralized by the death of his 17-year-old daughter in a 1946 car accident, and was then diagnosed with cancer. He died in 1948.\n\nHis youngest brother Cameron, an insurance executive in Hartford, CT, stepped in as trustee, but it is unclear whether either Francis or Cameron ever received payment from the government of the court-ordered price of \"square 710.\" If not, there may be the ironic situation of a government law-enforcement agency headquarters located on land for which the government did not comply with the law by paying the lawful price. Cameron Winslow, determining that no one in the next generation appeared interested in managing the property, and unable to manage the properties day-to-day from Hartford, began selling all remaining parts of the property in the 1950s, completing the last of the sales in the 1960s, breaking up the landed estate that Robert Brent had assembled some 200 years before.\n\nOver the decades, much of the land was acquired by or donated to [[Gallaudet University]], a prominent school for the deaf. Cogswell Hall, a residence hall of Gallaudet University, is said to be built on the site of the old Brentwood Mansion. According to a website on Washington ghost stories, students have reported that it is haunted by the spirit of a little girl. Allegedly, blankets have been yanked off, an unplugged alarm clock went off, papers have moved with no draft or breeze, there are feelings of being watched, and at least one student has been tapped awake with no one there.\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe Brentwood and Bloomingdale neighborhoods are low-lying areas, located at the foot of hills a few blocks north.  Because of this, flash flooding can occur during the spring and summer downpours which are common in Washington. Current storm drains are not adequate, resulting in submerged vehicles and filled-up basement apartments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wtop.com/41/3018850/Councilmember-Relief-fund-needed-for-victims-of-Sundays-flooding|title=Councilmember: Relief fund needed for victims of Sunday's flooding |publisher=wtop.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref>\n\n==Brentwood today==\n[[File:Rhode Island Avenue-Brentwood Station.jpg|thumb|200px|Rhode Island Avenue-Brentwood Station of the [[Washington Metro]]]] \nBrentwood neighborhood as it is today (whose boundaries are somewhat different than the original Brent property, as increased by Pearson) is trapezoidal in its geography.

It is serviced by the [[Rhode Island Ave-Brentwood (Washington Metro)|Rhode Island Ave-Brentwood]] Metro station. Politically, Brentwood is in Ward 5.\n\nIt is best known as the site of the Joseph Curseen Jr. and Thomas Morris Jr. Processing and Distribution Center, the [[U.S. Postal Service|postal]] mail sorting facility through which [[anthrax disease|anthrax]]-contaminated mail addressed to two members of the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] passed in the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]<ref>\u201cThe Anthrax Cleanup of Capitol Hill.\u201d Documentary by Xin Wang produced by the EPA Alumni Association.

The town was named for Bredenbury Court, located near [[Bredenbury]], Herefordshire. The court was the manor home of William Henry Barneby, who traveled three times (in 1881, 1883, 1888) to western Canada and wrote books about his experiences.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barry|first1=Bill|title=Geographic Names of Saskatchewan|url=https://archive.org/details/geographicnameso0000barr|url-access=registration|date=September 2005|publisher=People Places Publishing, Ltd.|location=Regina, Saskatchewan|isbn=1-897010-19-2|p=[https://archive.org/details/geographicnameso0000barr/page/57 57]}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBredenbury is located on the Yellowhead Highway (#16).  It is 41 kilometres southeast of [[Yorkton]] and 50&nbsp;km west of the [[Manitoba]] border.  Bredenbury is approximately 2.5 hours from [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] and four hours from [[Winnipeg]].  The surrounding land is mainly used for agriculture and ranching.\n\n==Economy==\nBredenbury has an economy based largely on [[agriculture]], [[potash]] mining and the railway, along with their supporting businesses.  A [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] main line runs through the town.  There are railway car cleaning and fertilizer plants in Bredenbury as well.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{canada census\n|2006_population=329\n|2006_pop_delta=-7.1\n|2006_land_area=4.80\n|2006_pop_density=68.5\n|2006_pop_rank=\n|2006_median_age=42.6 \n|2006_median_age_m=40.8\n|2006_median_age_f=46.0\n|2006_total_pvt_dwell=159\n|2006_total_pvt_dwell_usual=144\n|2006_mean_hh_income=43,056\n|2006_access_date=2009-02-24\n}}\n\n==Education==\nThere are no public schools in Bredenbury itself.  Students are bussed to [[Saltcoats, Saskatchewan|Saltcoats]] for elementary school and to [[Yorkton]] for high school.  Bredenbury Elementary School closed in 2001.  The school building in the town is currently empty. The Mennonites operate a private parochial school: the Countryside School.\n\n==Christmas lights==\nChristmas in Bredenbury started out relatively small with a single street that dubbed itself 'Candy Cane Lane' and sported matching red and white candy canes down the length of the entire street.  In subsequent years, the rest of the town has caught that same spirit, and the town is home to a special 'Light Up' ceremony at the beginning of December each year, along with elaborate displays at private homes, businesses and empty lots throughout the town.\n\nBredenbury has won the national WinterLights competition for communities with populations under 1,000 in 2001, 2002 and 2005.  As a result of the community involvement with the Christmas celebrations, Bredenbury has hosted the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] Holiday Train, with performers such as [[Tom Jackson (actor)|Tom Jackson]].  Bredenbury hosted the Holiday Train again in 2007, when the featured performers were [[Wide Mouth Mason]] and [[Melanie Doane]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Canadian Pacific Railway|title=Saskatchewan and Manitoba Holiday Train Schedule|url=http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/English/General+Public/Holiday+Train/Schedules/SK+-+Manitoba.htm|accessdate=2007-11-14|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110124923/http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/English/General%2BPublic/Holiday%2BTrain/Schedules/SK%2B-%2BManitoba.htm|archivedate=2007-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==Sports teams and other athletic attractions==\n* Bredenbury Cougars - Triangle Hockey League (Senior Men's)\n* Bredenbury Golf Course - a nine-hole golf course with artificial greens, maintained by local volunteers.\n\n            \n{{Canadian City Geographic Location|\nNorth=[[Stornoway, Saskatchewan|Stornoway]]|\nWest=[[Saltcoats, Saskatchewan|Saltcoats]]|\nCenter=Bredenbury|\nEast=[[Churchbridge, Saskatchewan|Churchbridge]]|\nSouth=[[Esterhazy, Saskatchewan|Esterhazy]]}}\n<br><ref name=map>{{Citation\n |last=Becquet's Custom Programming \n |title=Saskatchewan City & Town Maps - Directory \n |date=August 17, 2005 \n |url=http://www.becquet.com/director/maps/index.htm \n |accessdate=2007-10-03 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704083437/http://www.becquet.com/director/maps/index.htm \n |archivedate=2007-07-04 \n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Notes and sources==\n<references/>\n* {{Citation\n  | last = Government of Saskatchewan\n  | first =\n  | author-link =\n  | last2 =\n  | first2 =\n  | author2-link =\n  | title = Municipal Directory System\n  | date =\n  | year =\n  | url = http://www.municipal.gov.sk.ca/apps/Pub/MDS/muniDetails.aspx?cat=1&mun=1869\n  | accessdate = 2007-11-04\n  | format =  &ndash; <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3AGovernment+of+Saskatchewan+intitle%3AMunicipal+Directory+System&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> }} {{dead link|date=April 2009}}\n* {{Citation\n  | last = Government of Canada\n  | first =\n  | author-link =\n  | last2 =\n  | first2 =\n  | author2-link =\n  | title = 2006 Census Community Profiles\n  | date =\n  | year =\n  | url = http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=4705079&Geo2=PR&Code2=47&Data=Count&SearchText=bredenbury&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=47&B1=All&Custom=\n  | accessdate = 2007-11-04 }}\n* {{Citation|last=Saskatchewan Learning|title=Saltcoats School Profile|url=http://www.sasklearningvillage.ca/lv/DIVYSD/36sal/hpPUB.nsf/8f22e9637c74849a8025685f006a90bb/e1e16e94a3d05d2506256f64005c7931/$FILE/orbsop05.doc.pdf|accessdate=2007-11-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704124657/http://www.sasklearningvillage.ca/lv/DIVYSD/36sal/hpPUB.nsf/8f22e9637c74849a8025685f006a90bb/e1e16e94a3d05d2506256f64005c7931/%24FILE/orbsop05.doc.pdf|archivedate=2009-07-04}}\n* {{Citation\n |last=Sask Biz \n |title=Bredenbury Community Profile \n |url=http://www.saskbiz.ca/communityprofiles/communityprofile.asp?CommunityID=229 \n |accessdate=2007-11-04 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016142158/http://www.saskbiz.ca/communityprofiles/CommunityProfile.Asp?CommunityID=229 \n |archivedate=2007-10-16 \n}}\n\n==Published works==\n* {{Citation\n  | last = Bredenbury Senior Citizens\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = ''Memory Lane: A Local History of Bredenbury and Districts''\n  | publisher = Bredenbury History Book Committee\n  | year = 1978\n  | location = Bredenbury, Sask\n  | pages = 164\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =  \n  | isbn = 0-88925-028-6}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of communities in Saskatchewan]]\n*[[List of rural municipalities in Saskatchewan]]\n\n{{coord|display=title|name=Bredenbury, Saskatchewan|50|56|30|N|102|03|1|W|region:CA_type:city}}\n{{SKDivision5}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Saskatchewan]]\n[[Category:Saltcoats No. 213, Saskatchewan]]\n[[Category:Division No. 5, Saskatchewan]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See Template:Infobox settlement for additional fields and descriptions -->\n| name                    = Bredenbury\n| native_name             =\n| native_name_lang        = en <!-- ISO 639-2 code e.g. \"fr\" for French.

As of the 2016 Canadian Census, the population of Bredenbury was 372<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=4705079&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=Bredenbury&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&GeoLevel=PR&GeoCode=4705079&TABID=1|title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Bredenbury, Town [Census subdivision], Saskatchewan and Ontario [Province]|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-10-05}}</ref>.  The main industries in the area are [[Agriculture|farming]] as well as [[potash]] mining near [[Esterhazy, Saskatchewan|Esterhazy]].  The community is known in the area for its enthusiastic [[Christmas]] light displays which have won national awards.\n\n==History==\nBredenbury received a post office in 1890 and was incorporated in 1913. The town was named for Bredenbury Court, located near [[Bredenbury]], Herefordshire. The court was the manor home of William Henry Barneby, who traveled three times (in 1881, 1883, 1888) to western Canada and wrote books about his experiences.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barry|first1=Bill|title=Geographic Names of Saskatchewan|url=https://archive.org/details/geographicnameso0000barr|url-access=registration|date=September 2005|publisher=People Places Publishing, Ltd.|location=Regina, Saskatchewan|isbn=1-897010-19-2|p=[https://archive.org/details/geographicnameso0000barr/page/57 57]}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBredenbury is located on the Yellowhead Highway (#16).  It is 41 kilometres southeast of [[Yorkton]] and 50&nbsp;km west of the [[Manitoba]] border.  Bredenbury is approximately 2.5 hours from [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] and four hours from [[Winnipeg]].  The surrounding land is mainly used for agriculture and ranching.\n\n==Economy==\nBredenbury has an economy based largely on [[agriculture]], [[potash]] mining and the railway, along with their supporting businesses.  A [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] main line runs through the town.  There are railway car cleaning and fertilizer plants in Bredenbury as well.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{canada census\n|2006_population=329\n|2006_pop_delta=-7.1\n|2006_land_area=4.80\n|2006_pop_density=68.5\n|2006_pop_rank=\n|2006_median_age=42.6 \n|2006_median_age_m=40.8\n|2006_median_age_f=46.0\n|2006_total_pvt_dwell=159\n|2006_total_pvt_dwell_usual=144\n|2006_mean_hh_income=43,056\n|2006_access_date=2009-02-24\n}}\n\n==Education==\nThere are no public schools in Bredenbury itself.  Students are bussed to [[Saltcoats, Saskatchewan|Saltcoats]] for elementary school and to [[Yorkton]] for high school.  Bredenbury Elementary School closed in 2001.  The school building in the town is currently empty. The Mennonites operate a private parochial school: the Countryside School.\n\n==Christmas lights==\nChristmas in Bredenbury started out relatively small with a single street that dubbed itself 'Candy Cane Lane' and sported matching red and white candy canes down the length of the entire street.  In subsequent years, the rest of the town has caught that same spirit, and the town is home to a special 'Light Up' ceremony at the beginning of December each year, along with elaborate displays at private homes, businesses and empty lots throughout the town.\n\nBredenbury has won the national WinterLights competition for communities with populations under 1,000 in 2001, 2002 and 2005.  As a result of the community involvement with the Christmas celebrations, Bredenbury has hosted the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] Holiday Train, with performers such as [[Tom Jackson (actor)|Tom Jackson]].  Bredenbury hosted the Holiday Train again in 2007, when the featured performers were [[Wide Mouth Mason]] and [[Melanie Doane]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Canadian Pacific Railway|title=Saskatchewan and Manitoba Holiday Train Schedule|url=http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/English/General+Public/Holiday+Train/Schedules/SK+-+Manitoba.htm|accessdate=2007-11-14|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110124923/http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/English/General%2BPublic/Holiday%2BTrain/Schedules/SK%2B-%2BManitoba.htm|archivedate=2007-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==Sports teams and other athletic attractions==\n* Bredenbury Cougars - Triangle Hockey League (Senior Men's)\n* Bredenbury Golf Course - a nine-hole golf course with artificial greens, maintained by local volunteers.\n\n            \n{{Canadian City Geographic Location|\nNorth=[[Stornoway, Saskatchewan|Stornoway]]|\nWest=[[Saltcoats, Saskatchewan|Saltcoats]]|\nCenter=Bredenbury|\nEast=[[Churchbridge, Saskatchewan|Churchbridge]]|\nSouth=[[Esterhazy, Saskatchewan|Esterhazy]]}}\n<br><ref name=map>{{Citation\n |last=Becquet's Custom Programming \n |title=Saskatchewan City & Town Maps - Directory \n |date=August 17, 2005 \n |url=http://www.becquet.com/director/maps/index.htm \n |accessdate=2007-10-03 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704083437/http://www.becquet.com/director/maps/index.htm \n |archivedate=2007-07-04 \n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Notes and sources==\n<references/>\n* {{Citation\n  | last = Government of Saskatchewan\n  | first =\n  | author-link =\n  | last2 =\n  | first2 =\n  | author2-link =\n  | title = Municipal Directory System\n  | date =\n  | year =\n  | url = http://www.municipal.gov.sk.ca/apps/Pub/MDS/muniDetails.aspx?cat=1&mun=1869\n  | accessdate = 2007-11-04\n  | format =  &ndash; <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3AGovernment+of+Saskatchewan+intitle%3AMunicipal+Directory+System&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> }} {{dead link|date=April 2009}}\n* {{Citation\n  | last = Government of Canada\n  | first =\n  | author-link =\n  | last2 =\n  | first2 =\n  | author2-link =\n  | title = 2006 Census Community Profiles\n  | date =\n  | year =\n  | url = http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=4705079&Geo2=PR&Code2=47&Data=Count&SearchText=bredenbury&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=47&B1=All&Custom=\n  | accessdate = 2007-11-04 }}\n* {{Citation|last=Saskatchewan Learning|title=Saltcoats School Profile|url=http://www.sasklearningvillage.ca/lv/DIVYSD/36sal/hpPUB.nsf/8f22e9637c74849a8025685f006a90bb/e1e16e94a3d05d2506256f64005c7931/$FILE/orbsop05.doc.pdf|accessdate=2007-11-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704124657/http://www.sasklearningvillage.ca/lv/DIVYSD/36sal/hpPUB.nsf/8f22e9637c74849a8025685f006a90bb/e1e16e94a3d05d2506256f64005c7931/%24FILE/orbsop05.doc.pdf|archivedate=2009-07-04}}\n* {{Citation\n |last=Sask Biz \n |title=Bredenbury Community Profile \n |url=http://www.saskbiz.ca/communityprofiles/communityprofile.asp?CommunityID=229 \n |accessdate=2007-11-04 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016142158/http://www.saskbiz.ca/communityprofiles/CommunityProfile.Asp?CommunityID=229 \n |archivedate=2007-10-16 \n}}\n\n==Published works==\n* {{Citation\n  | last = Bredenbury Senior Citizens\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = ''Memory Lane: A Local History of Bredenbury and Districts''\n  | publisher = Bredenbury History Book Committee\n  | year = 1978\n  | location = Bredenbury, Sask\n  | pages = 164\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =  \n  | isbn = 0-88925-028-6}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of communities in Saskatchewan]]\n*[[List of rural municipalities in Saskatchewan]]\n\n{{coord|display=title|name=Bredenbury, Saskatchewan|50|56|30|N|102|03|1|W|region:CA_type:city}}\n{{SKDivision5}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Saskatchewan]]\n[[Category:Saltcoats No. 213, Saskatchewan]]\n[[Category:Division No. 5, Saskatchewan]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bredenbury,_Saskatchewan"}

The family were [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[working class]], and led by the acid-tongued matriarch Nellie Boswell ([[Jean Boht]]) who ruled over her family with an iron fist.

Throughout the series, Joey was in love with dour, demanding divorcee Roxy ([[Joanna Phillips-Lane]]), whom he finally marriedin the final series. The character was extremely popular for the first four series, and Peter Howitt was considered the series' heartthrob and breakout star. When he decided to leave ''Bread'' to concentrate on directing and other acting opportunities, his replacement was not as popular with viewers, so the character wasn't as prominent in the later series. \n\nSecond-eldest child Jack was the thoughtful, sensitive type who ran an antique-dealing business, often with disastrous results. Actor [[Victor McGuire]] was absent in series 4, and Jack went to America for a year. He returned in series 5 and eventually fell in love with an older woman, Leonora ([[Deborah Grant]]), who moved in across the road. Adrian ([[Jonathon Morris]]) was the theatrical poet, who had his poetry published ('My Granny's Bucket'). His real name was Jimmy, but he changed his name to Adrian which he considered \"less common\". He endured relationships with several highly-sexed women and was frequently seen emerging red-faced from the bushes.\nThe youngest Boswell son, Billy ([[Nick Conway]]), was loud-mouthed, annoying, and immature. He somehow managed to father Francesca with his miserable mistress Julie ([[Caroline Milmoe]]/[[Hilary Crowson]]) who lived across the road. Billy married Julie in series 3, but they were divorced by series 5, and Julie moved to Sefton Park (and left the series), leaving Billy devastated. Billy drove an old [[Volkswagen]] Beetle which constantly backfired when driven, as well as a van from the back of which he sold sandwiches.\n\nThe only Boswell daughter was Aveline ([[Gilly Coman]]/[[Melanie Hill]]), a colourful, enduring model who married Protestant vicar Oswald Carter ([[Giles Watling]]) at the end of series 4 (to staunchly-Catholic Nellie's outrage); after trying to conceive throughout series 5, Aveline gives birth to Ursula in series 6.\n\nNext door is grumpy, permanently-hungry Grandad ([[Kenneth Waller]]). The series doesn't make explicitly-clear whether he is Nellie's or Freddie's father, as he is only ever referred to and called Grandad. However, in a fleeting sequence in a series-4 episode, Freddie is arrested for stealing his rubbish cart. When the family arrive at the Police Station to collect him, Nellie refers to Freddie as Grandad's son-in-law for the only time, confirming that he is, in fact, her own father. He appeared in all seven series and was in the last episode's final scene, alongside Jean Boht. Grandad was frequently seen telling people to \"Piss off!\" and reminiscing about his childhood sweetheart Edie Matteson.\n\nThere are also several notable supporting characters seen throughout the series: the [[deadpan]] [[Department of Health and Social Security]] clerk Martina ([[Pamela Power]]) spent all seven series enduring the various tales the Boswells spun to get more [[Unemployment benefits|dole]] money. She perfected her catchphrase \"Next!\" but ultimately failed to snare her favorite Boswell, 'Shifty' ([[Bryan Murray (actor)|Bryan Murray]]), after several attempts at a relationship with him. Shifty arrived in series 4, ostensibly to cover Jack's absence in the series, but he stayed on in ''Bread'' after Jack's return and lived next door with Grandad until the end of the sixth series.\n\nOther neighbours include Celia Higgins, played by [[Rita Tushingham]] during series 4; in series 6 and 7, Leonora Campbell (Debra Grant) moved into Julie's old house and eventually began dating Jack.\n\nThe show's title is a reference to \"bread\" meaning \"money\"; though this is not a Liverpudlian [[Scouse]] expression but [[rhyming slang|cockney rhyming slang]] (\"bread and honey\"). Liverpudlians at the time largely referred to money as \"dough\". A regular scenario in each episode was that of Nellie opening a cockerel-fashioned kitchen egg-basket prior to the evening meal into which the family would place money for their upkeep. The amount of money placed in the pot by each depended on how successful a day they'd had. The pot would be at the forefront of the screen at the end of each episode as the credits rolled.\n\nOther frequently-seen scenarios included Nellie answering a cordless phone (a newfangled item in the mid-1980s) which she kept in the pocket of her pinny; she always said \"Hello, yes?\" when answering, followed by a series of frantic \"Thank you\"s when it was Derek ([[Peter Byrne (actor)|Peter Byrne]]), Nellie's secret park-bench pal, on the other end, ensuring the parking places outside the terraced house were kept free for the family's many vehicles, by putting out illicitly-acquired police traffic cones.\n\nThe show featured [[soap opera]]-style [[cliffhanger]]s, meaning that viewers had to watch each week to see how the previous week's cliffhanger would be resolved. This also meant that each episode was not self-contained, but the plot unfolded as the series progressed.

Lane countered these criticisms saying that her characters were cartoonish and one-dimensional, and were not intended to be a serious social comment on the state of Liverpool.<ref name=bbc/> \n\nIn 1989, at the height of ''Bread'''s success, the departure of two of the series leading actors, [[Peter Howitt]] as Joey, and [[Gilly Coman]] as Aveline, led to the characters being re-cast. The replacement actors attracted criticism for not playing the parts as well as their predecessors, and this damaged the programme's ratings{{Citation needed|reason=Says who|date=June 2019}}. ''Bread'' was also criticised several times in both the ''[[Radio Times]]'' and on  ''[[Points of View (TV programme)|Points of View]]'' for its [[swearing|bad language]] before the 9pm [[Watershed (broadcasting)|watershed]] - Grandad's catchphrase \"Piss off!\" was often the cause of complaints.\n\n== DVD releases ==\nAll seven series of the sitcom were released onto DVD in 2014.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{BBC Online|comedy/guide/articles/b/bread_1299000416.shtml|''Bread''}}\n*{{BBC programme}}\n*{{IMDb title|0090402|Bread}}\n*{{British Comedy Guide|tv|bread|Bread}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060522021047/http://www.phill.co.uk/comedy/bread/index.html ''Bread''] at Phill.co.uk\n*[http://www.collectingbooksandmagazines.com/tvbread.html ''Bread''] Illustrated article on Collecting Books and Magazines website\n\n{{Carla Lane}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bread (Tv Series)}}\n[[Category:1986 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1991 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s British sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1990s British sitcoms]]\n[[Category:BBC television sitcoms]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Liverpool]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=August 2013}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Bread\n| image                    = L8ElswickStreet.jpg\n| caption                  = {{nowrap|Elswick Street: Where the exterior shots were filmed.}}\n| camera                   = [[Multicamera setup|Multi-camera]]\n| runtime                  = 30 mins\n| creator                  = [[Carla Lane]]\n| writer                   = [[Carla Lane]]\n| director                 = Susan Belbin (1986\u20131988)<br/>Robin Nash (1987\u201389)<br/>John B.

The family were [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[working class]], and led by the acid-tongued matriarch Nellie Boswell ([[Jean Boht]]) who ruled over her family with an iron fist. Early series focused on her children attempting to make enough money (in English slang, \"[[bread#Noun|bread]]\") to support the family through various illicit means.<ref name=bbc>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-36425330|title=Carla Lane's sitcom Bread and its legacy in Liverpool|first=Bronwyn|last=Jones|date=3 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NUXIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1313&dq=bread%20bbc%20liverpool%20sitcom#v=onepage&q=bread%20bbc%20liverpool%20sitcom&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Television|first1=Horace|last1=Newcomb|first2=Lambdin Kay Distinguished Professor for the Peabody Awards Horace|last2=Newcomb|date=3 February 2014|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=6 February 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781135194727}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NUJMAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA127&dq=bread%20bbc%20liverpool%20sitcom#v=onepage&q=bread%20bbc%20liverpool%20sitcom&f=false|title=Making Sense of Suburbia Through Popular Culture|first=Rupa|last=Huq|date=15 August 2013|publisher=A&C Black|accessdate=6 February 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781780932248}}</ref> Later series saw less emphasis on making money schemes, and more storylines focusing on the characters' love lives and marriages.\n\n==Characters==\nThe Boswell family consisted of Nellie's philandering, free-spirited husband Freddie ([[Ronald Forfar]]) who spent most of the series with one foot in the family household, and the other with his mistress, the red-haired Irish siren Lilo Lil ([[Eileen Pollock]]). - This union led to one of the series' most famous catchphrases, which Nellie frequently declared about Lilo Lil in a storm of rage: \"She is a tart!\"\n\nEldest child Joey ([[Peter Howitt]]/[[Graham Bickley]]) was essentially the level-headed household head, with his leather trousers, classic [[Jaguar]], and charming demeanor (\"Greetings!\" was his catchphrase), Joey was involved in tax fraud after making a fortune selling personalized number plates and not declaring this to the taxman. Throughout the series, Joey was in love with dour, demanding divorcee Roxy ([[Joanna Phillips-Lane]]), whom he finally marriedin the final series. The character was extremely popular for the first four series, and Peter Howitt was considered the series' heartthrob and breakout star. When he decided to leave ''Bread'' to concentrate on directing and other acting opportunities, his replacement was not as popular with viewers, so the character wasn't as prominent in the later series. \n\nSecond-eldest child Jack was the thoughtful, sensitive type who ran an antique-dealing business, often with disastrous results. Actor [[Victor McGuire]] was absent in series 4, and Jack went to America for a year. He returned in series 5 and eventually fell in love with an older woman, Leonora ([[Deborah Grant]]), who moved in across the road. Adrian ([[Jonathon Morris]]) was the theatrical poet, who had his poetry published ('My Granny's Bucket'). His real name was Jimmy, but he changed his name to Adrian which he considered \"less common\". He endured relationships with several highly-sexed women and was frequently seen emerging red-faced from the bushes.\nThe youngest Boswell son, Billy ([[Nick Conway]]), was loud-mouthed, annoying, and immature. He somehow managed to father Francesca with his miserable mistress Julie ([[Caroline Milmoe]]/[[Hilary Crowson]]) who lived across the road. Billy married Julie in series 3, but they were divorced by series 5, and Julie moved to Sefton Park (and left the series), leaving Billy devastated. Billy drove an old [[Volkswagen]] Beetle which constantly backfired when driven, as well as a van from the back of which he sold sandwiches.\n\nThe only Boswell daughter was Aveline ([[Gilly Coman]]/[[Melanie Hill]]), a colourful, enduring model who married Protestant vicar Oswald Carter ([[Giles Watling]]) at the end of series 4 (to staunchly-Catholic Nellie's outrage); after trying to conceive throughout series 5, Aveline gives birth to Ursula in series 6.\n\nNext door is grumpy, permanently-hungry Grandad ([[Kenneth Waller]]). The series doesn't make explicitly-clear whether he is Nellie's or Freddie's father, as he is only ever referred to and called Grandad. However, in a fleeting sequence in a series-4 episode, Freddie is arrested for stealing his rubbish cart. When the family arrive at the Police Station to collect him, Nellie refers to Freddie as Grandad's son-in-law for the only time, confirming that he is, in fact, her own father. He appeared in all seven series and was in the last episode's final scene, alongside Jean Boht. Grandad was frequently seen telling people to \"Piss off!\" and reminiscing about his childhood sweetheart Edie Matteson.\n\nThere are also several notable supporting characters seen throughout the series: the [[deadpan]] [[Department of Health and Social Security]] clerk Martina ([[Pamela Power]]) spent all seven series enduring the various tales the Boswells spun to get more [[Unemployment benefits|dole]] money. She perfected her catchphrase \"Next!\" but ultimately failed to snare her favorite Boswell, 'Shifty' ([[Bryan Murray (actor)|Bryan Murray]]), after several attempts at a relationship with him. Shifty arrived in series 4, ostensibly to cover Jack's absence in the series, but he stayed on in ''Bread'' after Jack's return and lived next door with Grandad until the end of the sixth series.\n\nOther neighbours include Celia Higgins, played by [[Rita Tushingham]] during series 4; in series 6 and 7, Leonora Campbell (Debra Grant) moved into Julie's old house and eventually began dating Jack.\n\nThe show's title is a reference to \"bread\" meaning \"money\"; though this is not a Liverpudlian [[Scouse]] expression but [[rhyming slang|cockney rhyming slang]] (\"bread and honey\"). Liverpudlians at the time largely referred to money as \"dough\". A regular scenario in each episode was that of Nellie opening a cockerel-fashioned kitchen egg-basket prior to the evening meal into which the family would place money for their upkeep. The amount of money placed in the pot by each depended on how successful a day they'd had. The pot would be at the forefront of the screen at the end of each episode as the credits rolled.\n\nOther frequently-seen scenarios included Nellie answering a cordless phone (a newfangled item in the mid-1980s) which she kept in the pocket of her pinny; she always said \"Hello, yes?\" when answering, followed by a series of frantic \"Thank you\"s when it was Derek ([[Peter Byrne (actor)|Peter Byrne]]), Nellie's secret park-bench pal, on the other end, ensuring the parking places outside the terraced house were kept free for the family's many vehicles, by putting out illicitly-acquired police traffic cones.\n\nThe show featured [[soap opera]]-style [[cliffhanger]]s, meaning that viewers had to watch each week to see how the previous week's cliffhanger would be resolved. This also meant that each episode was not self-contained, but the plot unfolded as the series progressed. This was unusual for a comedy at the time, but has been used to great effect by comedies since.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Regular characters===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n! Actor !! Role !! Episodes !!

However, the proposal was eventually dropped when the rights couldn't be settled with [[Carla Lane]]'s estate, and the BBC later confirmed that they would not be proceeding with the project.\n\n==Criticism==\nThough the show was popular, and received audiences over 21 million, ''Bread'' was criticised for mocking Liverpudlian culture and people, who had suffered significant economic downturn and unemployment in the 1980s. Lane countered these criticisms saying that her characters were cartoonish and one-dimensional, and were not intended to be a serious social comment on the state of Liverpool.<ref name=bbc/> \n\nIn 1989, at the height of ''Bread'''s success, the departure of two of the series leading actors, [[Peter Howitt]] as Joey, and [[Gilly Coman]] as Aveline, led to the characters being re-cast. The replacement actors attracted criticism for not playing the parts as well as their predecessors, and this damaged the programme's ratings{{Citation needed|reason=Says who|date=June 2019}}. ''Bread'' was also criticised several times in both the ''[[Radio Times]]'' and on  ''[[Points of View (TV programme)|Points of View]]'' for its [[swearing|bad language]] before the 9pm [[Watershed (broadcasting)|watershed]] - Grandad's catchphrase \"Piss off!\" was often the cause of complaints.\n\n== DVD releases ==\nAll seven series of the sitcom were released onto DVD in 2014.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{BBC Online|comedy/guide/articles/b/bread_1299000416.shtml|''Bread''}}\n*{{BBC programme}}\n*{{IMDb title|0090402|Bread}}\n*{{British Comedy Guide|tv|bread|Bread}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060522021047/http://www.phill.co.uk/comedy/bread/index.html ''Bread''] at Phill.co.uk\n*[http://www.collectingbooksandmagazines.com/tvbread.html ''Bread''] Illustrated article on Collecting Books and Magazines website\n\n{{Carla Lane}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bread (Tv Series)}}\n[[Category:1986 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1991 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s British sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1990s British sitcoms]]\n[[Category:BBC television sitcoms]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Liverpool]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_(TV_series)"}

The series stars [[Brian Stepanek]], [[Allison Munn]], [[Aidan Gallagher]], Casey Simpson, Mace Coronel, [[Lizzy Greene]], Gabrielle Elyse, and Kyla-Drew Simmons.\n\n== Premise ==\nThe series focuses on [[quadruplets]] Nicky, Ricky, Dicky, and Dawn Harper, nine years old at the start of the series,<ref>{{cite episode|series=Nicky, Ricky, Dicky, and Dawn|title=Mall in the Family|author=Ricky Harper|minutes=2:00|quote=She's eleven.}}</ref> who have nothing in common and often fight, but must work together to solve everyday situations.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn episodes}}\n{{:List of Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn episodes}}\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Brian Stepanek]] as Tom, the father of the Harper family quadruplets. It is a running gag in the series that he cares more about his possessions than his children, but he loves his family and is a kid at heart.\n* [[Allison Munn]] as Anne, the mother of the Harper family quadruplets who usually gets caught up in Tom's new obsessions.\n* [[Aidan Gallagher]] as Nicky, the youngest of the Harper quadruplets. He is shown to be quite comedic, quirky, and easily confused.\n* Casey Simpson as Ricky, is the second oldest of the Harper quadruplets. He is the smart one of the group, always seen carrying a book or doing his homework. He is also a neat freak and a bit of a goody two-shoes, though he occasionally tries to prove to Dawn and his brothers that he can bend rules as well.\n* Mace Coronel as Dicky, the third oldest and easy-going Harper quadruplet who cares a great deal about his appearance. He always takes the easy way out. He ships himself to Australia in \"[[List of Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn episodes#ep78|Quadcodile Dundee]]\".\n* [[Lizzy Greene]] as Dawn, the oldest of the Harper quadruplets. Although she's always seen bothering her brothers, she does care about them deeply. There is a consistent rivalry for the leader spot of the quads between her and Ricky.\n* Gabrielle Elyse as Josie (season 1), a worker at Tom's sporting shop and babysitter for Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn.<!-- Note: Gabrielle Elyse is main cast credited, but only for the episodes she appears in. -->\n* Kyla-Drew Simmons as Mae (recurring, seasons 1\u20132; main, seasons 3\u20134), the quads' friend and Dawn's best friend.

The series stars [[Brian Stepanek]], [[Allison Munn]], [[Aidan Gallagher]], Casey Simpson, Mace Coronel, [[Lizzy Greene]], Gabrielle Elyse, and Kyla-Drew Simmons.\n\n== Premise ==\nThe series focuses on [[quadruplets]] Nicky, Ricky, Dicky, and Dawn Harper, nine years old at the start of the series,<ref>{{cite episode|series=Nicky, Ricky, Dicky, and Dawn|title=Mall in the Family|author=Ricky Harper|minutes=2:00|quote=She's eleven.}}</ref> who have nothing in common and often fight, but must work together to solve everyday situations.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn episodes}}\n{{:List of Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn episodes}}\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Brian Stepanek]] as Tom, the father of the Harper family quadruplets. It is a running gag in the series that he cares more about his possessions than his children, but he loves his family and is a kid at heart.\n* [[Allison Munn]] as Anne, the mother of the Harper family quadruplets who usually gets caught up in Tom's new obsessions.\n* [[Aidan Gallagher]] as Nicky, the youngest of the Harper quadruplets. He is shown to be quite comedic, quirky, and easily confused.\n* Casey Simpson as Ricky, is the second oldest of the Harper quadruplets. He is the smart one of the group, always seen carrying a book or doing his homework. He is also a neat freak and a bit of a goody two-shoes, though he occasionally tries to prove to Dawn and his brothers that he can bend rules as well.\n* Mace Coronel as Dicky, the third oldest and easy-going Harper quadruplet who cares a great deal about his appearance. He always takes the easy way out. He ships himself to Australia in \"[[List of Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn episodes#ep78|Quadcodile Dundee]]\".\n* [[Lizzy Greene]] as Dawn, the oldest of the Harper quadruplets. Although she's always seen bothering her brothers, she does care about them deeply. There is a consistent rivalry for the leader spot of the quads between her and Ricky.\n* Gabrielle Elyse as Josie (season 1), a worker at Tom's sporting shop and babysitter for Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn.<!-- Note: Gabrielle Elyse is main cast credited, but only for the episodes she appears in. -->\n* Kyla-Drew Simmons as Mae (recurring, seasons 1\u20132; main, seasons 3\u20134), the quads' friend and Dawn's best friend. She often calls herself \"the fifth quad\".\n\n=== Recurring ===\n* Lincoln Melcher as Mack (seasons 1\u20133)\n* Jason Sims-Prewitt as Principal Tarian (seasons 2\u20133)\n* [[Siena Agudong]] as Natlee (seasons 2\u20134)\n* Hayden Crawford as Dooley (seasons 3\u20134)\n* Theodore John Barnes as Miles (seasons 3\u20134)\n* Isabella Revel as Avery (seasons 3\u20134)\n* Ariana Molkara as Sadie (season 4)\n\n== Production ==\nThe series was originally picked up for 13 episodes on March 13, 2014, but was later increased to 20 episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/03/nickelodeon-greenlights-new-comedy-from-dan-schneider-two-other-live-action-series-698354/|title=Nickelodeon Greenlights New Comedy from Dan Schneider, Two Other Live-Action Series|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=March 13, 2014|access-date=August 4, 2014}}</ref> The series premiered on September 13, 2014.

A mole of a substance<ref name=IUPACrev/> or a mole of particles<ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20B\"> Schmidt-Rohr, K. (2020). [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.9b00467 \"Analysis of Two Definitions of the Mole That Are in Simultaneous Use, and Their Surprising Consequences\u201d]. ''J. Chem. Educ.'' '''97''': 597\u2013602.</ref> is defined as exactly {{val|6.02214076|e=23}} particles, which may be [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, [[ion]]s, or [[electron]]s.<ref name=IUPACrev/> In short, for particles 1 mol = {{val|6.02214076|e=23}}.<ref name=\"Brown&Holme Book\">Brown, L.; Holme, T. (2011) ''Chemistry for Engineering Students'', Brooks/Cole.</ref><ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20B\" />\n\nThe definition was adopted in November 2018 as one of the seven [[SI base unit]]s,<ref name=\"IUPACrev\"/> revising the previous definition that specified it as the number of atoms in 12 [[gram]]s of [[carbon-12]] (<sup>12</sup>C), an [[isotope]] of [[carbon]].\n\nThe number {{val|6.02214076|e=23}} (the [[Avogadro number]]) was chosen so that the mass of one mole of a chemical compound, in [[gram]]s, is numerically equal (for all practical purposes) to the average mass of one molecule of the compound, in [[dalton (unit)|daltons]]. Thus, for example, one mole of water contains {{val|6.02214076|e=23}} molecules, whose total mass is about 18.015 grams \u2013 and the mean mass of one molecule of water is about 18.015&nbsp;daltons.\n \nThe mole is widely used in chemistry as a convenient way to express amounts of reactants and products of chemical reactions.

For example, a solution may contain a certain number of dissolved molecules that are more or less independent of each other. However, in a solid the constituent particles are fixed and bound in a lattice arrangement, yet they may be separable without losing their chemical identity. Thus the solid is composed of a certain number of moles of such particles. In yet other cases, such as [[diamond]], where the entire crystal is essentially a single molecule, the mole is still used to express the number of atoms bound together, rather than a count of multiple molecules. Thus, common chemical conventions apply to the definition of the constituent particles of a substance, in other cases exact definitions may be specified.\n\n===Molar mass===\nThe [[molar mass]] of a substance is the [[mass]] of a sample, in multiples of the [[gram]], divided by the [[amount of substance]] in that sample. The amount of substance is the number of moles in the sample. It is a characteristic property of the substance.\nFor most practical purposes, its magnitude is numerically the same as that of the mean mass of one molecule, expressed in [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s.  For example, the molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.<ref name=BIPMrealise>[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]. \"[http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/SIApp2_mol_en.pdf Realising the mole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829154405/http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/SIApp2_mol_en.pdf |date=2008-08-29 }}.\" Retrieved 25 September 2008.</ref>  Other methods include the use of the [[molar volume]] or the measurement of [[electric charge]].<ref name=BIPMrealise/>\n\nThe number of moles of a substance in a sample is obtained by dividing the mass of the sample by the molar mass of the compound.  For example, 100 g of water is about 5.551&nbsp;mol of water.<ref name=BIPMrealise/>\n\nThe molar mass of a substance depends not only on its [[molecular formula]], but also on the distribution of [[isotopes]] of each chemical element present in it. For example, the mass of one mole of [[calcium-40]] is {{val|fmt=commas|39.96259098|0.00000022|u=grams}}, whereas the mass of one mole of [[calcium-42]] is {{val|fmt=commas|41.95861801|0.00000027|u=grams}}, and of one mole of [[calcium]] with the normal isotopic mix is {{val|40.078|0.004|u=grams}}.\n\n===Molar concentration===\nThe [[molar concentration]], also called ''molarity'', of a solution of some substance is the number of moles per unit of volume of the final solution. In the SI its standard unit is mol/[[Metre|m]]<sup>3</sup>, although more practical units, such as mole per litre (mol/L) are used.\n\n===Molar fraction===\nThe [[molar fraction]] or [[mole fraction]] of a substance in a mixture (such as a solution) is the number of moles of the compound in one sample of the mixture, divided by the total number of moles of all components.  For example, if 20 g of {{chem|NaCl}} is dissolved in 100 g of water, the amounts of the two substances in the solution will be (20 g)/(58.443 g/mol) = 0.34221&nbsp;mol and (100 g)/(18.015 g/mol) = 5.5509&nbsp;mol, respectively; and the molar fraction of {{chem|NaCl}} will be 0.34221/(0.34221 + 5.5509) = 0.05807.\n\nIn a mixture of gases, the [[partial pressure]] of each component is proportional to its molar ratio.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the mole is intertwined with that of [[molecular mass]], [[atomic mass unit]]s, the [[Avogadro number]].\n\nThe first table of [[standard atomic weight]] (atomic mass) was published by [[John Dalton]] (1766\u20131844) in 1805, based on a system in which the relative atomic mass of [[hydrogen]] was defined as 1. These relative atomic masses were based on the [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] proportions of chemical reaction and compounds, a fact that greatly aided their acceptance: It was not necessary for a chemist to subscribe to [[atomic theory]] (an unproven hypothesis at the time) to make practical use of the tables. This would lead to some confusion between atomic masses (promoted by proponents of atomic theory) and [[equivalent weight]]s (promoted by its opponents and which sometimes differed from relative atomic masses by an integer factor), which would last throughout much of the nineteenth century.\n\n[[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]] (1779\u20131848) was instrumental in the determination of relative atomic masses to ever-increasing accuracy. He was also the first chemist to use [[oxygen]] as the standard to which other masses were referred. Oxygen is a useful standard, as, unlike hydrogen, it forms compounds with most other elements, especially [[metals]]. However, he chose to fix the atomic mass of oxygen as 100, which did not catch on.\n\n[[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gerhardt]] (1816\u201356), [[Henri Victor Regnault]] (1810\u201378) and [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]] (1826\u20131910) expanded on Berzelius' works, resolving many of the problems of unknown stoichiometry of compounds, and the use of atomic masses attracted a large consensus by the time of the [[Karlsruhe Congress]] (1860). The convention had reverted to defining the atomic mass of hydrogen as 1, although at the level of precision of measurements at that time \u2013 relative uncertainties of around 1% \u2013 this was numerically equivalent to the later standard of oxygen = 16. However the chemical convenience of having oxygen as the primary atomic mass standard became ever more evident with advances in analytical chemistry and the need for ever more accurate atomic mass determinations.\n\nThe name ''mole'' is an 1897 translation of the German unit ''Mol'', coined by the [[chemist]] [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] in 1894 from the German word ''Molek\u00fcl'' ([[molecule]]).<ref>{{Cite journal\n|first=Georg\n|last=Helm\n|year=1897\n|title=The Principles of Mathematical Chemistry: The Energetics of Chemical Phenomena\n|series=transl. by Livingston, J.; Morgan, R.\n|place=New York\n|publisher=Wiley\n|page=6\n}}</ref><ref>Some sources place the date of first usage in English as 1902.

Amount of substance can be described as mass divided by Proust's \"definite proportions\", and contains information that is missing from the measurement of mass alone. As demonstrated by [[John Dalton|Dalton's]] [[law of partial pressures]] (1803), a measurement of mass is not even necessary to measure the amount of substance (although in practice it is usual). There are many physical relationships between amount of substance and other physical quantities, the most notable one being the [[ideal gas law]] (where the relationship was first demonstrated in 1857). The term \"mole\" was first used in a textbook describing these [[colligative properties]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Similar units==\nLike chemists, chemical engineers use the unit mole extensively, but different unit multiples may be more suitable for industrial use. For example, the SI unit for volume is the cubic metre, a much larger unit than the commonly used litre in the chemical laboratory. When amount of substance is also expressed in kmol (1000 mol) in industrial-scaled processes, the numerical value of molarity remains the same.\n\nFor convenience in avoiding conversions in the [[Imperial units|imperial]] (or [[United States customary units|American customary units]]), some engineers adopted the ''pound-mole'' (notation ''lb-mol'' or ''lbmol''), which is defined as the number of entities in 12 [[Pound (mass)|lb]] of <sup>12</sup>C.

This is analogous to the use of kg instead of g. The use of kmol is not only for \"magnitude convenience\" but also makes the equations used for modelling chemical engineering systems [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]]. For example, the conversion of a flowrate of kg/s to kmol/s only requires the molecular mass without the factor 1000 unless the basic SI unit of mol/s were to be used.\n\nGreenhouse and growth chamber lighting for plants is sometimes expressed in micromoles per square metre per second, where 1&nbsp;mol photons = {{val|6.02|e=23}} photons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lighting Radiation Conversion|url=http://www.egc.com/useful_info_lighting.php|accessdate=March 10, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311131342/http://www.egc.com/useful_info_lighting.php|archivedate=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Mole Day==\nOctober 23, denoted 10/23 in the US, is recognized by some as [[Mole Day]].<ref>[http://www.moleday.org/htdocs/history.html History of National Mole Day Foundation, Inc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023075040/http://www.moleday.org/htdocs/history.html |date=2010-10-23 }}</ref> It is an informal holiday in honor of the unit among chemists.

For example, a solution may contain a certain number of dissolved molecules that are more or less independent of each other. However, in a solid the constituent particles are fixed and bound in a lattice arrangement, yet they may be separable without losing their chemical identity. Thus the solid is composed of a certain number of moles of such particles. In yet other cases, such as [[diamond]], where the entire crystal is essentially a single molecule, the mole is still used to express the number of atoms bound together, rather than a count of multiple molecules. Thus, common chemical conventions apply to the definition of the constituent particles of a substance, in other cases exact definitions may be specified.\n\n===Molar mass===\nThe [[molar mass]] of a substance is the [[mass]] of a sample, in multiples of the [[gram]], divided by the [[amount of substance]] in that sample. The amount of substance is the number of moles in the sample. It is a characteristic property of the substance.\nFor most practical purposes, its magnitude is numerically the same as that of the mean mass of one molecule, expressed in [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s.  For example, the molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.<ref name=BIPMrealise>[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]. \"[http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/SIApp2_mol_en.pdf Realising the mole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829154405/http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/SIApp2_mol_en.pdf |date=2008-08-29 }}.\" Retrieved 25 September 2008.</ref>  Other methods include the use of the [[molar volume]] or the measurement of [[electric charge]].<ref name=BIPMrealise/>\n\nThe number of moles of a substance in a sample is obtained by dividing the mass of the sample by the molar mass of the compound.  For example, 100 g of water is about 5.551&nbsp;mol of water.<ref name=BIPMrealise/>\n\nThe molar mass of a substance depends not only on its [[molecular formula]], but also on the distribution of [[isotopes]] of each chemical element present in it. For example, the mass of one mole of [[calcium-40]] is {{val|fmt=commas|39.96259098|0.00000022|u=grams}}, whereas the mass of one mole of [[calcium-42]] is {{val|fmt=commas|41.95861801|0.00000027|u=grams}}, and of one mole of [[calcium]] with the normal isotopic mix is {{val|40.078|0.004|u=grams}}.\n\n===Molar concentration===\nThe [[molar concentration]], also called ''molarity'', of a solution of some substance is the number of moles per unit of volume of the final solution. In the SI its standard unit is mol/[[Metre|m]]<sup>3</sup>, although more practical units, such as mole per litre (mol/L) are used.\n\n===Molar fraction===\nThe [[molar fraction]] or [[mole fraction]] of a substance in a mixture (such as a solution) is the number of moles of the compound in one sample of the mixture, divided by the total number of moles of all components.  For example, if 20 g of {{chem|NaCl}} is dissolved in 100 g of water, the amounts of the two substances in the solution will be (20 g)/(58.443 g/mol) = 0.34221&nbsp;mol and (100 g)/(18.015 g/mol) = 5.5509&nbsp;mol, respectively; and the molar fraction of {{chem|NaCl}} will be 0.34221/(0.34221 + 5.5509) = 0.05807.\n\nIn a mixture of gases, the [[partial pressure]] of each component is proportional to its molar ratio.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the mole is intertwined with that of [[molecular mass]], [[atomic mass unit]]s, the [[Avogadro number]].\n\nThe first table of [[standard atomic weight]] (atomic mass) was published by [[John Dalton]] (1766\u20131844) in 1805, based on a system in which the relative atomic mass of [[hydrogen]] was defined as 1. These relative atomic masses were based on the [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] proportions of chemical reaction and compounds, a fact that greatly aided their acceptance: It was not necessary for a chemist to subscribe to [[atomic theory]] (an unproven hypothesis at the time) to make practical use of the tables. This would lead to some confusion between atomic masses (promoted by proponents of atomic theory) and [[equivalent weight]]s (promoted by its opponents and which sometimes differed from relative atomic masses by an integer factor), which would last throughout much of the nineteenth century.\n\n[[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]] (1779\u20131848) was instrumental in the determination of relative atomic masses to ever-increasing accuracy. He was also the first chemist to use [[oxygen]] as the standard to which other masses were referred. Oxygen is a useful standard, as, unlike hydrogen, it forms compounds with most other elements, especially [[metals]]. However, he chose to fix the atomic mass of oxygen as 100, which did not catch on.\n\n[[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gerhardt]] (1816\u201356), [[Henri Victor Regnault]] (1810\u201378) and [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]] (1826\u20131910) expanded on Berzelius' works, resolving many of the problems of unknown stoichiometry of compounds, and the use of atomic masses attracted a large consensus by the time of the [[Karlsruhe Congress]] (1860). The convention had reverted to defining the atomic mass of hydrogen as 1, although at the level of precision of measurements at that time \u2013 relative uncertainties of around 1% \u2013 this was numerically equivalent to the later standard of oxygen = 16. However the chemical convenience of having oxygen as the primary atomic mass standard became ever more evident with advances in analytical chemistry and the need for ever more accurate atomic mass determinations.\n\nThe name ''mole'' is an 1897 translation of the German unit ''Mol'', coined by the [[chemist]] [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] in 1894 from the German word ''Molek\u00fcl'' ([[molecule]]).<ref>{{Cite journal\n|first=Georg\n|last=Helm\n|year=1897\n|title=The Principles of Mathematical Chemistry: The Energetics of Chemical Phenomena\n|series=transl. by Livingston, J.; Morgan, R.\n|place=New York\n|publisher=Wiley\n|page=6\n}}</ref><ref>Some sources place the date of first usage in English as 1902.

Amount of substance can be described as mass divided by Proust's \"definite proportions\", and contains information that is missing from the measurement of mass alone. As demonstrated by [[John Dalton|Dalton's]] [[law of partial pressures]] (1803), a measurement of mass is not even necessary to measure the amount of substance (although in practice it is usual). There are many physical relationships between amount of substance and other physical quantities, the most notable one being the [[ideal gas law]] (where the relationship was first demonstrated in 1857). The term \"mole\" was first used in a textbook describing these [[colligative properties]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Similar units==\nLike chemists, chemical engineers use the unit mole extensively, but different unit multiples may be more suitable for industrial use. For example, the SI unit for volume is the cubic metre, a much larger unit than the commonly used litre in the chemical laboratory. When amount of substance is also expressed in kmol (1000 mol) in industrial-scaled processes, the numerical value of molarity remains the same.\n\nFor convenience in avoiding conversions in the [[Imperial units|imperial]] (or [[United States customary units|American customary units]]), some engineers adopted the ''pound-mole'' (notation ''lb-mol'' or ''lbmol''), which is defined as the number of entities in 12 [[Pound (mass)|lb]] of <sup>12</sup>C.  One lb-mol is equal to {{val|fmt=commas|453.59237|u=mol}},<ref name=Himmelblau>{{cite book|first=David|last = Himmelblau|year=1996|title=Basic Principles and Calculations in Chemical Engineering|edition=6|isbn=978-0-13-305798-0|pages=17\u201320}}</ref> which value is the same as the number of grams in an [[international avoirdupois pound]].\n\nIn the metric system, chemical engineers once used the ''kilogram-mole'' (notation ''kg-mol''), which is defined as the number of entities in 12&nbsp;kg of <sup>12</sup>C, and often referred to the mole as the ''gram-mole'' (notation ''g-mol''), when dealing with laboratory data.<ref name=Himmelblau/>\n\nLate 20th-century chemical engineering practice came to use the ''kilomole'' (kmol), which is numerically identical to the kilogram-mole, but whose name and symbol adopt the SI convention for standard multiples of metric units \u2013 thus, kmol means 1000&nbsp;mol.  This is analogous to the use of kg instead of g. The use of kmol is not only for \"magnitude convenience\" but also makes the equations used for modelling chemical engineering systems [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]]. For example, the conversion of a flowrate of kg/s to kmol/s only requires the molecular mass without the factor 1000 unless the basic SI unit of mol/s were to be used.\n\nGreenhouse and growth chamber lighting for plants is sometimes expressed in micromoles per square metre per second, where 1&nbsp;mol photons = {{val|6.02|e=23}} photons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lighting Radiation Conversion|url=http://www.egc.com/useful_info_lighting.php|accessdate=March 10, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311131342/http://www.egc.com/useful_info_lighting.php|archivedate=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Mole Day==\nOctober 23, denoted 10/23 in the US, is recognized by some as [[Mole Day]].<ref>[http://www.moleday.org/htdocs/history.html History of National Mole Day Foundation, Inc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023075040/http://www.moleday.org/htdocs/history.html |date=2010-10-23 }}</ref> It is an informal holiday in honor of the unit among chemists.

{"title_page": "Brake fluid", "text_new": "'''Brake fluid''' is a type of [[hydraulic fluid]] used in [[hydraulic brake]] and [[Clutch|hydraulic clutch]] applications in [[automobile]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, [[light truck]]s, and some [[bicycle]]s. It is used to transfer force into pressure, and to [[Pascals law#Explanation|amplify]] braking force. It works because [[liquid#Mechanical properties|liquid]]s are not appreciably [[compression (physical)|compressible]].\n\nMost brake fluids used today are [[Glycol ethers|glycol-ether]] based, but [[mineral oil]] (''[[Citro\u00ebn]]/[[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]] liquide hydraulique min\u00e9ral'' ([[Hydropneumatic suspension#LHS versus LHM|LHM]])) and [[silicone]]-based (DOT 5) fluids are also available.<ref >{{cite web|url=http://www.peterverdone.com/archive/files/hydraulic%20system%20theory.pdf|format=PDF|title=Chapter 7 : Basic Hydraulic System Theory|website=Peterverdone.com|accessdate=2018-07-06}}</ref>\n\n==Standards==\nBrake fluids must meet certain requirements as defined by various standards set by international, national, or local organizations or government agencies.  \n\n===International===\nThe [[International Standards Organisation]] has published its standard ISO 4925, defining classes 3, 4, and 5, as well as class 5.1 and class 6,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/38513.html|title=ISO 4925:2005 - Road vehicles -- Specification of non-petroleum-base brake fluids for hydraulic systems|website=www.iso.org}}</ref> reflecting progressively higher performance for brake fluids.\n\n===United States===\nThe [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] SAE has published standards J1703, J1704, and J1705, reflecting progressively higher performance for brake fluids.   These have counterparts in the international standard, ISO 4925.\n\nMost brake fluid sold in North America is classified by the US [[Department of Transportation]] (DOT) under its own ratings such as \"DOT 3\" and \"DOT 4\" and these are widely used in other countries. Their classifications broadly reflect the SAE's specifications, but with local details \u2014 [[Alaska]] and the [[Azores]] for example, have different normal temperature and humidity ranges to consider.  DOT 3 is equivalent to SAE J1703 and ISO class 3, DOT 4 to SAE J1704 and ISO class 4, etc.<ref name=standards>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.anton-paar.com/en/automotive-brake-fluids/|title=Viscosity of Automotive Brake Fluids|publisher=Anton Paar Wiki|accessdate=2018-05-25}}</ref>\n\nAll approved fluids must be colorless or amber to be acceptable for street use in the U.S, except for DOT 5 silicone, which must be purple.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n==== DOT 4 ====\nWhile a vehicle that uses DOT 3 may also use DOT 4 or 5.1 if the elastomers in the system accept the borate compounds that raise the boiling point,{{fact|date=January 2013}} (a temperature upgrade) a vehicle that requires DOT 4 might boil the brake fluid if a DOT 3 (a temperature downgrade) is used. Additionally, these [[polyglycol ether|polyglycol-ether]]-based fluids cannot be mixed with DOT 5.0, which is silicone based.\n\n{{As of|2006}}, most cars produced in the U.S. use DOT 4 brake fluid.\n\n==== DOT 5 ====\nDOT 5 is a silicone-based fluid and is separate from the series of DOT 2, 3, 4, 5.1. It is immiscible with water, and with other brake fluids, and must not be mixed with them. Systems can change fluid only after a complete system changeover, such as a total restoration.\n\nIt contains at least 70% by weight of a diorgano polysiloxane.<ref >[http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?section=571.116 Standard No. 116; Motor vehicle brake fluids Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49 - Transportation, Chapter V - Part 571 - Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (49CFR571), Subpart B, Sec. 571.116 Standard No. 116; Motor vehicle brake fluids]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208235145/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?section=571.116 |date=2008-12-08\n}}</ref> Unlike polyethylene glycol based fluids, DOT 5 is [[hydrophobic]].<ref >{{cite web |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-parts/types-of-brake-fluid.htm |title=What are the different types of brake fluid? |work=How Stuff Works |date=2008-12-01 |access-date=2018-08-12}}</ref> An advantage over other forms of brake fluid is that silicone has a more stable viscosity index over a wider temperature range.

DOT 5 fluid can aerate when the anti-lock brake system is activated. DOT 5 brake fluid absorbs a small amount of air requiring care when bleeding the system of air.<ref >{{cite web|url=http://www.freeasestudyguides.com/dot-5-brake-fluid.html|title=DOT 5 Brake Fluid: Not for ABS|website=www.freeasestudyguides.com}}</ref>\n\nLack of acceptance of silicone-based fluids led to the development of DOT 5.1, a fluid giving the performance advantages of silicone, whilst retaining some familiarity and compatibility with the glycol ester fluids.\n\n=== Citro\u00ebn hydropneumatic suspension ===\nIn the 1950s, Citro\u00ebn introduced a [[hydropneumatic suspension]] system, powered by an engine-driven pump and also used to operate the braking system. This used a Citro\u00ebn-specific hydraulic fluid. The first fluid was [[LHS (hydraulic fluid)|LHS]], a vegetable oil-based fluid. This was later replaced by [[LHM (hydraulic fluid)|LHM]], a mineral fluid. LHS was hygroscopic and gave problems with internal corrosion. Although the two fluids are incompatible, LHM has been universal since 1967, and most older cars have been converted to use it.\n\nThis system was also used on Rolls-Royce and some Maserati models.\n\n=== Hydragas and Hydrolastic suspension ===\n[[Hydragas]] and [[Hydrolastic]] suspension were a widely used form of hydropneumatic suspension, designed by [[Alex Moulton]], and used on [[British Leyland]] cars from the 1960s. This system was not engine-driven and did not involve the braking system. \n\nThe fluid was a low viscosity fluid based on diluted alcohol.<ref >{{Cite web\n  |title=Hydragas suspension technical data\n  |website=Hydragas Register\n  |url=http://www.hydragas.co.uk/technical.html\n}}</ref>\n:    49% alcohol\n:    49% distilled water\n:    1% [[triethanolamine]] phosphate  (surfactant)\n:    1% sodium [[mercaptobenzothiazole]] (stenching agent)\n\n==Characteristics==\nBrake fluids must have certain characteristics and meet certain quality standards for the braking system to work properly.\n\n===Viscosity===\nFor reliable, consistent brake system operation, brake fluid must maintain a constant viscosity under a wide range of temperatures, including extreme cold. This is especially important in systems with an [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), [[traction control]], and [[stability control]] (ESP), as these systems often use micro-valves and require very rapid activation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.partinfo.co.uk/articles/63|title=Brake Fluid Exchange and Technology|website=Partinfo.co.uk|accessdate=2018-05-16}}</ref>  DOT 5.1 fluids are specified with low viscosity over a wide range of temperatures, although not all cars fitted with ABS or ESP specify DOT 5.1 brake fluid.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.trwaftermarket.com/en/passenger-cars-and-lcv/actuation-systems/brake-fluid/|title=Brake Fluid|website=Trwaftermarket.com|accessdate=2018-05-26}}</ref>\nEven more car factory provides or recommends for a faster reaction of the ABS and ESP systems the DOT 4 LV (low viscosity) brake fluids.\nThe specific V100 value of this products 1,50 - 2,00 mm2/sec.\n\n===Boiling point===\nBrake fluid is subjected to very high temperatures, especially in the [[wheel cylinder]]s of [[drum brake]]s and [[disk brake]] calipers. It must have a high boiling point to avoid vaporizing in the lines. This vaporization creates a problem because vapor is highly compressible relative to liquid, and therefore negates the hydraulic transfer of braking force - so the brakes will fail to stop the vehicle.<ref name=epic>{{cite web|url=http://www.epicbleedsolutions.com/blog/dot-brake-fluid-vs-mineral-oil/|title=DOT Brake Fluid vs. Mineral Oil|website=Epicbleedsolutions.com|accessdate=2018-05-25}}</ref>\n\nQuality standards refer to a brake fluid's \"dry\" and \"wet\" boiling points. The wet boiling point, which is usually much lower (although above most normal service temperatures), refers to the fluid's boiling point after absorbing a certain amount of moisture. This is several (single digit) percent, varying from formulation to formulation. Glycol-ether (DOT 3, 4, and 5.1) brake fluids are [[Hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] (water absorbing), which means they absorb moisture from the atmosphere under normal humidity levels.  Non-hygroscopic fluids (e.g. [[silicone]]/DOT 5 and mineral oil based formulations), are [[hydrophobic]], and can maintain an acceptable boiling point over the fluid's service life.\n\nSilicone based fluid is more compressible than glycol based fluid, leading to brakes with a ''spongy'' feeling.<ref name=epic/> It can potentially suffer phase separation/water pooling and freezing/boiling in the system over time - the main reason single phase hygroscopic fluids are used.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Characteristics of common braking fluids<ref name=\"DOT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CFR-2011-title49-vol6/CFR-2011-title49-vol6-sec571-116|title=49 CFR 571.116 - Standard No. 116; Motor vehicle brake fluids.|website=Gpo.gov|accessdate=2018-07-06}}</ref><ref name=epic/>\n|-\n!\n!

They must also protect against corrosion as moisture enters the system. Additives (corrosion inhibitors) are added to the base fluid to accomplish this. Silicone is less corrosive to paintwork unlike glycol-ether based DOT fluids.<ref name=epic/>\n\nThe advantage of the Citro\u00ebn LHM mineral oil based brake fluid is the absence of corrosion. Seals may wear out at high mileages but otherwise these systems have exceptional longevity. It cannot be used as a substitute without changing seals due to incompatibility with the rubber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xpowerforums.com/Brake_Fluidsl_FA_Questions.htm|title=AN EXPLANATION OF BRAKE AND CLUTCH FLUIDS|website=Xpowerforums.com|accessdate=2015-05-26}}</ref>\n\n===Compressibility===\nBrake fluids must maintain a low level of compressibility, even with varying temperatures to accommodate different environmental conditions. This is important to ensure consistent brake pedal feel. As compressibility increases, more brake pedal travel is necessary for the same amount of brake caliper piston force.\n\n==Service and maintenance==\n\nGlycol-ether (DOT 3, 4, and 5.1) brake fluids are hygroscopic (water absorbing), which means they absorb moisture from the atmosphere under normal humidity levels. Non-hygroscopic fluids (e.g. silicone/DOT 5 and mineral oil based formulations), are hydrophobic, and can maintain an acceptable boiling point over the fluid's service life. Ideally, silicone fluid should be used only to fill non-ABS systems that have not been previously filled with glycol based fluid. Any system that has used glycol-based fluid (DOT 3/4/5.1) will contain moisture; glycol fluid disperses the moisture throughout the system and contains corrosion inhibitors. Silicone fluid does not allow moisture to enter the system, but does not disperse any that is already there, either. A system filled from dry with silicone fluid does not require the fluid to be changed at intervals, only when the system has been disturbed for a component repair or renewal. The United States armed forces have standardised on silicone brake fluid since the 1990s.

This used a Citro\u00ebn-specific hydraulic fluid. The first fluid was [[LHS (hydraulic fluid)|LHS]], a vegetable oil-based fluid. This was later replaced by [[LHM (hydraulic fluid)|LHM]], a mineral fluid. LHS was hygroscopic and gave problems with internal corrosion. Although the two fluids are incompatible, LHM has been universal since 1967, and most older cars have been converted to use it.\n\nThis system was also used on Rolls-Royce and some Maserati models.\n\n=== Hydragas and Hydrolastic suspension ===\n[[Hydragas]] and [[Hydrolastic]] suspension were a widely used form of hydropneumatic suspension, designed by [[Alex Moulton]], and used on [[British Leyland]] cars from the 1960s. This system was not engine-driven and did not involve the braking system. \n\nThe fluid was a low viscosity fluid based on diluted alcohol.<ref >{{Cite web\n  |title=Hydragas suspension technical data\n  |website=Hydragas Register\n  |url=http://www.hydragas.co.uk/technical.html\n}}</ref>\n:    49% alcohol\n:    49% distilled water\n:    1% [[triethanolamine]] phosphate  (surfactant)\n:    1% sodium [[mercaptobenzothiazole]] (stenching agent)\n\n==Characteristics==\nBrake fluids must have certain characteristics and meet certain quality standards for the braking system to work properly.\n\n===Viscosity===\nFor reliable, consistent brake system operation, brake fluid must maintain a constant viscosity under a wide range of temperatures, including extreme cold. This is especially important in systems with an [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), [[traction control]], and [[stability control]] (ESP), as these systems often use micro-valves and require very rapid activation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.partinfo.co.uk/articles/63|title=Brake Fluid Exchange and Technology|website=Partinfo.co.uk|accessdate=2018-05-16}}</ref>  DOT 5.1 fluids are specified with low viscosity over a wide range of temperatures, although not all cars fitted with ABS or ESP specify DOT 5.1 brake fluid.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.trwaftermarket.com/en/passenger-cars-and-lcv/actuation-systems/brake-fluid/|title=Brake Fluid|website=Trwaftermarket.com|accessdate=2018-05-26}}</ref>\nEven more car factory provides or recommends for a faster reaction of the ABS and ESP systems the DOT 4 LV (low viscosity) brake fluids.\nThe specific V100 value of this products 1,50 - 2,00 mm2/sec.\n\n===Boiling point===\nBrake fluid is subjected to very high temperatures, especially in the [[wheel cylinder]]s of [[drum brake]]s and [[disk brake]] calipers. It must have a high boiling point to avoid vaporizing in the lines. This vaporization creates a problem because vapor is highly compressible relative to liquid, and therefore negates the hydraulic transfer of braking force - so the brakes will fail to stop the vehicle.<ref name=epic>{{cite web|url=http://www.epicbleedsolutions.com/blog/dot-brake-fluid-vs-mineral-oil/|title=DOT Brake Fluid vs. Mineral Oil|website=Epicbleedsolutions.com|accessdate=2018-05-25}}</ref>\n\nQuality standards refer to a brake fluid's \"dry\" and \"wet\" boiling points. The wet boiling point, which is usually much lower (although above most normal service temperatures), refers to the fluid's boiling point after absorbing a certain amount of moisture. This is several (single digit) percent, varying from formulation to formulation. Glycol-ether (DOT 3, 4, and 5.1) brake fluids are [[Hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] (water absorbing), which means they absorb moisture from the atmosphere under normal humidity levels.  Non-hygroscopic fluids (e.g. [[silicone]]/DOT 5 and mineral oil based formulations), are [[hydrophobic]], and can maintain an acceptable boiling point over the fluid's service life.\n\nSilicone based fluid is more compressible than glycol based fluid, leading to brakes with a ''spongy'' feeling.<ref name=epic/> It can potentially suffer phase separation/water pooling and freezing/boiling in the system over time - the main reason single phase hygroscopic fluids are used.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Characteristics of common braking fluids<ref name=\"DOT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CFR-2011-title49-vol6/CFR-2011-title49-vol6-sec571-116|title=49 CFR 571.116 - Standard No. 116; Motor vehicle brake fluids.|website=Gpo.gov|accessdate=2018-07-06}}</ref><ref name=epic/>\n|-\n!\n!

They must also protect against corrosion as moisture enters the system. Additives (corrosion inhibitors) are added to the base fluid to accomplish this. Silicone is less corrosive to paintwork unlike glycol-ether based DOT fluids.<ref name=epic/>\n\nThe advantage of the Citro\u00ebn LHM mineral oil based brake fluid is the absence of corrosion. Seals may wear out at high mileages but otherwise these systems have exceptional longevity. It cannot be used as a substitute without changing seals due to incompatibility with the rubber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xpowerforums.com/Brake_Fluidsl_FA_Questions.htm|title=AN EXPLANATION OF BRAKE AND CLUTCH FLUIDS|website=Xpowerforums.com|accessdate=2015-05-26}}</ref>\n\n===Compressibility===\nBrake fluids must maintain a low level of compressibility, even with varying temperatures to accommodate different environmental conditions. This is important to ensure consistent brake pedal feel. As compressibility increases, more brake pedal travel is necessary for the same amount of brake caliper piston force.\n\n==Service and maintenance==\n\nGlycol-ether (DOT 3, 4, and 5.1) brake fluids are hygroscopic (water absorbing), which means they absorb moisture from the atmosphere under normal humidity levels. Non-hygroscopic fluids (e.g. silicone/DOT 5 and mineral oil based formulations), are hydrophobic, and can maintain an acceptable boiling point over the fluid's service life. Ideally, silicone fluid should be used only to fill non-ABS systems that have not been previously filled with glycol based fluid. Any system that has used glycol-based fluid (DOT 3/4/5.1) will contain moisture; glycol fluid disperses the moisture throughout the system and contains corrosion inhibitors. Silicone fluid does not allow moisture to enter the system, but does not disperse any that is already there, either. A system filled from dry with silicone fluid does not require the fluid to be changed at intervals, only when the system has been disturbed for a component repair or renewal. The United States armed forces have standardised on silicone brake fluid since the 1990s. Silicone fluid is used extensively in cold climates, particularly in Russia and Finland.\n\nBrake fluids with different DOT ratings can not always be mixed. DOT 5 should not be mixed with any of the others as mixing of glycol with silicone fluid may cause corrosion because of trapped moisture.  DOT 2 should not be mixed with any of the others.  DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5.1 are all based on glycol esters and can be mixed, although it is preferable to completely replace existing fluids with fresh to obtain the specified performance.\n\nBrake fluid is toxic<ref name=\"toxicity\">{{cite web|url=http://www.online.petro-canada.ca/datasheets/en_CA/w449.pdf|title=MSDS for DOT 3 brake fluid|website=Online.petro-canada.ca|accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> and can damage painted surfaces.<ref name=\"Paint damage by Brake Fluid\">{{cite web|url=http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/maintenance/generaltips.htm|title=General Tips|publisher=Total Motorcycle|accessdate=2018-05-25}}</ref>\n\n==Components==\n=== Castor oil-based (pre-DOT, DOT 2) ===\n* [[Castor oil]]\n* [[Alcohol]], usually [[butanol]] (red / crimson fluid) or [[ethanol]] (yellow fluid) (methanol)\n\n===Glycol-based (DOT 3, 4, 5.1)===\n* [[Alkyl ester]]\n* [[Aliphatic]] [[amine]]\n* [[Diethylene glycol]]\n* [[Diethylene glycol monoethyl ether]]\n* [[Diethylene glycol monomethyl ether]]\n* [[Dimethyl dipropylene glycol]]\n* [[Polyethylene glycol monobutyl ether]]\n* [[Polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether]]\n* [[Polyethylene oxide]]\n* [[Triethylene glycol monobutyl ether]]\n* [[Triethylene glycol monoethyl ether]]\n* [[Triethylene glycol monomethyl ether]]\n\n===Silicone-based (DOT 5)===\n* [[Dioctyl sebacate|Di-2-ethylhexyl sebacate]]\n* [[Dimethyl polysiloxane]]\n* [[Tributyl phosphate]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hydropneumatic]]\n* [[Pascal's law]]\n*[[Brake fluid pressure sensor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070304074607/http://www.carcare.org/Brakes/brake_fluid.shtml Car care council]\n* [http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-parts/types-of-brake-fluid.htm ''How Stuff Works: What are the different types of brake fluid?'']\n* [http://www.stoptech.com/tech_info/wp_brakefluid_1a.shtml StopTech: Brake Fluid 1A]\n\n{{Motor fuel}}\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brake Fluid}}\n[[Category:Vehicle braking technologies]]\n[[Category:Automotive chemicals]]\n[[Category:Hydraulic fluids]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake_fluid"}

BFS uses 4 scheduling tiers (called scheduling policies or scheduling classes) ordered from best to worst which determines how tasks are selected<ref name=\"4.0-sched-bfs-462.patch\" />{{rp|ln 4146-4161}} with the ones on top being executed first.\n\nEach task has a special value called a prio.  In the v0.462 edition (used in the -ck 4.0 kernel patchset), there are total of 103 \"priority queues\" (aka prio) or allowed values that it can take.  No actual special data structure was used as the priority queue but only the doubly linked list runqueue itself.  The lower prio value means it is more important and gets executed first.\n\n====Realtime policy====\n\nThe realtime policy was designed for [[Real-time computing|realtime]] tasks.  This policy implies that the running tasks cannot be interrupted (i.e. preempted) by the lower prio-ed task or lower priority policy tiers.

During the 1999\u20132000 season, he was the top scorer of his team with 15 goals and attracted the attention of another Croatian club, [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]]. Playing for Dinamo, Balaban kept up his goalscoring form and once again became the league's top scorer with 14 goals in 25 games. Two games into the following season, he was signed by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for a fee of \u00a35.8 million, earning a \u00a320,000-a-week contract.<ref name=\"av\">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/dec/05/newsstory.sport19?INTCMP=SRCH | title=Balaban's contract terminated by Villa | work=The Guardian | accessdate=4 September 2012 | location=London | first=Dominic | last=Fifield | date=4 December 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Villa===\nBalaban failed to find any form for Aston Villa, making just nine appearances, seven as a substitute, in two and a half years.<ref name=\"av\" /> He was loaned back to Dinamo Zagreb for the 2002\u201303 season, scoring 15 times in 24 appearances. In December 2003, Aston Villa released Balaban from his contract and he signed for [[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]] on a free transfer.<ref name=\"av\" />\n\nBalaban is regularly cited as one of the worst Premier League signings of all time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727003744/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article2096584.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=The 50 worst transfers |first=Bill |last=Edgar |date=18 July 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2010 }}</ref> In a 2019 interview with ''[[FourFourTwo]]'', Balaban disputed this, arguing that Aston Villa never gave him an opportunity to play: \"If you\u2019re a club that throws big money at signings and then doesn\u2019t let them actually play, the jokes should really be at your expense.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=What\u2019s it like to be a big-money flop?

In August 2007, Balaban went back to Dinamo after Brugge had bought the top scorer [[Fran\u00e7ois Sterchele]]. Balaban stated he would miss Brugge very much and he had a wonderful time at the club. He earned the nickname amongst Brugge fans of \"Super Bosko\", due to him scoring four times in one match and scoring at an average of 0.5 goals per match.\n\n===Dinamo Zagreb===\nDuring Balaban's time at Dinamo Zagreb, he had an incident with fascist salute, which he made to fans after scoring a goal against [[NK Inter Zapre\u0161i\u0107|Inter Zapresic]]. He had to pay a fine of 100KN (around \u20ac14).<ref>{{cite web|title=JOE's Forgotten Footballers: Bo\u0161ko Balaban|url=https://www.joe.ie/uncategorized/joes-forgotten-footballers-bosko-balaban-46754|website=[[Joe (website)|Joe]]|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Panionios===\nIn June 2009, [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]] signed Balaban on a three-year contract.

His debut came in a friendly match against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] on 16 August 2000, after being a regular member of the [[Croatia national under-21 football team|Croatian under-21 team]] for more than a year. His debut proved successful, as he scored Croatia's only goal in a 1-1 draw.\n\nBalaban excelled during Croatia's qualifying campaign for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], appearing in all eight matches and scored five goals, including a [[hat-trick]] against [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] in a 4\u20131 victory on 24 March 2001. He was also in the Croatian squad at the final 2002 World Cup tournament, but spent all three group matches on the bench. He subsequently did not appear in any matches for Croatia between February 2003 and August 2004, missing the entire [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] qualifying campaign as well as the final tournament. He made his competitive comeback against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] on 9 October 2004 in the Croatian team's qualifying campaign for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and subsequently appeared in another four qualifying matches, scoring a brace against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] on 3 September 2005. He was also a squad member at the 2006 World Cup finals, but once again spent all three group matches on the bench.\n\nIn early September 2006, Croatia manager [[Slaven Bili\u0107]] dropped Balaban, along with teammates [[Ivica Oli\u0107]] and [[Dario Srna]], from the squad for their opening [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] qualifier against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] because of a late-night party in a [[Zagreb]] disco. However, Balaban was the only one of the three players to return to the squad for the very next qualifier against [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] one month later, which Croatia won 7-0. Coming on as a substitute an hour into the match, and with Croatia 5\u20130 up, Balaban subsequently scored the fastest-ever goal by a single player for the Croatian national team, scoring just 20 seconds after coming onto the pitch.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Club===\n:Source:<ref name=\"Dinamo Zagreb statistics\">{{cite

as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]].\n\nHe is a former member of the [[Croatia national football team|Croatia national team]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nBorn in [[Rijeka]], he started playing for local club [[NK Rijeka|HNK Rijeka]] and appeared in 97 matches between 1995 and 2000, scoring a total of 21 goals. During the 1999\u20132000 season, he was the top scorer of his team with 15 goals and attracted the attention of another Croatian club, [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]]. Playing for Dinamo, Balaban kept up his goalscoring form and once again became the league's top scorer with 14 goals in 25 games. Two games into the following season, he was signed by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for a fee of \u00a35.8 million, earning a \u00a320,000-a-week contract.<ref name=\"av\">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/dec/05/newsstory.sport19?INTCMP=SRCH | title=Balaban's contract terminated by Villa | work=The Guardian | accessdate=4 September 2012 | location=London | first=Dominic | last=Fifield | date=4 December 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Villa===\nBalaban failed to find any form for Aston Villa, making just nine appearances, seven as a substitute, in two and a half years.<ref name=\"av\" /> He was loaned back to Dinamo Zagreb for the 2002\u201303 season, scoring 15 times in 24 appearances. In December 2003, Aston Villa released Balaban from his contract and he signed for [[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]] on a free transfer.<ref name=\"av\" />\n\nBalaban is regularly cited as one of the worst Premier League signings of all time<ref>{{cite news |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727003744/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article2096584.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=The 50 worst transfers |first=Bill |last=Edgar |date=18 July 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2010 }}</ref>. In a 2019 interview with ''[[FourFourTwo]]'', Balaban disputed this, arguing that Aston Villa never gave him an opportunity to play: \"If you\u2019re a club that throws big money at signings and then doesn\u2019t let them actually play, the jokes should really be at your expense.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=What\u2019s it like to be a big-money flop?

In August 2007, Balaban went back to Dinamo after Brugge had bought the top scorer [[Fran\u00e7ois Sterchele]]. Balaban stated he would miss Brugge very much and he had a wonderful time at the club. He earned the nickname amongst Brugge fans of \"Super Bosko\", due to him scoring four times in one match and scoring at an average of 0.5 goals per match.\n\n===Dinamo Zagreb===\nDuring Balaban's time at Dinamo Zagreb, he had an incident with fascist salute, which he made to fans after scoring a goal against [[NK Inter Zapre\u0161i\u0107|Inter Zapresic]]. He had to pay a fine of 100KN (around \u20ac14).<ref>{{cite web|title=JOE's Forgotten Footballers: Bo\u0161ko Balaban|url=https://www.joe.ie/uncategorized/joes-forgotten-footballers-bosko-balaban-46754|website=[[Joe (website)|Joe]]|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Panionios===\nIn June 2009, [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]] signed Balaban on a three-year contract. Balaban scored eight goals and he was Panionios' first scorer for the [[Super League Greece 2009-10|Super League 2009\u201310]].\n\n===Selangor FA===\nOn 29 January 2012, Malaysian Super League team [[Selangor FA]] signed Balaban for an undisclosed fee. He debuted, and scored the winning goal in the game against league leaders [[Kelantan FA]] on 14 February 2012, Selangor winning 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-sg/match/73145/selangor-fa-vs-kelantan-fa/report|title=Selangor 2\u20131 Kelantan: Bosko Balaban proves he is worth the wait |author=Zulhilmi Zainal|publisher=Goal.com|date=14 February 2012 |accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://football.thestar.com.my/2012/02/15/selangor-striker-balaban-scores-during-debut-to-condemn-leaders-kelantan-to-first-defeat/|title=Bosko starts with a bang|author=K.

His debut came in a friendly match against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] on 16 August 2000, after being a regular member of the [[Croatia national under-21 football team|Croatian under-21 team]] for more than a year. His debut proved successful, as he scored Croatia's only goal in a 1-1 draw.\n\nBalaban excelled during Croatia's qualifying campaign for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], appearing in all eight matches and scored five goals, including a [[hat-trick]] against [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] in a 4\u20131 victory on 24 March 2001. He was also in the Croatian squad at the final 2002 World Cup tournament, but spent all three group matches on the bench. He subsequently did not appear in any matches for Croatia between February 2003 and August 2004, missing the entire [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] qualifying campaign as well as the final tournament. He made his competitive comeback against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] on 9 October 2004 in the Croatian team's qualifying campaign for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and subsequently appeared in another four qualifying matches, scoring a brace against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] on 3 September 2005. He was also a squad member at the 2006 World Cup finals, but once again spent all three group matches on the bench.\n\nIn early September 2006, Croatia manager [[Slaven Bili\u0107]] dropped Balaban, along with teammates [[Ivica Oli\u0107]] and [[Dario Srna]], from the squad for their opening [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] qualifier against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] because of a late-night party in a [[Zagreb]] disco. However, Balaban was the only one of the three players to return to the squad for the very next qualifier against [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] one month later, which Croatia won 7-0. Coming on as a substitute an hour into the match, and with Croatia 5\u20130 up, Balaban subsequently scored the fastest-ever goal by a single player for the Croatian national team, scoring just 20 seconds after coming onto the pitch.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Club===\n:Source:<ref name=\"Dinamo Zagreb statistics\">{{cite
