On the surface, there appears to be numerical duplication between several Interstate Highways and state routes\u2014such as [[Interstate 86 (east)|I-86]] (I-86) and [[New York State Route 86|NY&nbsp;86]]\u2014but the \"I\" suffix that is appended to Interstate Highway numbers allows the Interstate Highway and state route to co-exist (\"86I\" versus \"86\", respectively). \n\nThere are a combined {{convert|1673|mi|0}} of Interstate Highways within New York, which handles about 19 percent of vehicle travel in New York.<ref>{{cite web |title=Key Facts About New York's Interstate Highway System |publisher=Tripnet.org |accessdate=June 15, 2008 |url=http://www.tripnet.org/NewYorkInterstateFactSheet062906.pdf |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327023227/http://www.tripnet.org/NewYorkInterstateFactSheet062906.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}</ref> At approximately {{convert|0.50|mi|2}}, [[Interstate 78 in New York|I-78]] is the shortest main Interstate Highway, while [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]] is the longest, spanning {{convert|385.88|mi|2}} within New York.

In the late 19th century, scientists first argued that human emissions of [[greenhouse gases]] could change the [[climate]]. Many other theories of [[climate change]] were advanced, involving forces from [[volcanism]] to [[solar variation]]. Thomas Edison, pioneer of electrical technologies, voiced concern for climate change{{citation  needed|date=February 2020}} and support for renewable energy in the 1930s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/thomas-edison-champion-of-renewable-energy-1204180|title=Thomas Edison Saw the Value of Renewable Energy|last=West|first=Larry|website=ThoughtCo|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> In the 1960s, the warming effect of [[carbon dioxide]] gas became increasingly convincing. Some scientists also pointed out that human activities that generated atmospheric [[aerosols]] (e.g., \"pollution\") could have cooling effects as well.\n\nDuring the 1970s, scientific opinion increasingly favored the warming viewpoint. By the 1990s, as a result of improving fidelity of [[computer models]] and observational work confirming the [[Milankovitch theory]] of the ice ages, a consensus position formed: greenhouse gases were deeply involved in most climate changes and human-caused emissions were bringing discernible [[global warming]]. Since the 1990s, scientific research on climate change has included multiple disciplines and has expanded. Research has expanded our understanding of causal relations, links with historic data and ability to model climate change numerically.  Research during this period has been summarized in the Assessment Reports by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].\n\n[[Climate change (general concept)|Climate change]], broadly interpreted, is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. It may be a change in average weather conditions, or in the distribution of weather around the average conditions (such as more or fewer [[Effects of global warming#Extreme weather|extreme weather]] events). Climate change is caused by factors that include oceanic processes (such as oceanic circulation), biotic processes (e.g., plants), variations in [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]] received by Earth, [[plate tectonics]] and [[volcanism|volcanic eruptions]], and human-induced alterations of the natural world. The latter effect is currently causing global warming, and \"climate change\" is often used to describe human-specific impacts.\n\n== Regional changes, antiquity through 19th century ==\n{{See also|Holocene}}\nFrom ancient times, people suspected that the climate of a region could change over the course of centuries. For example, [[Theophrastus]], a pupil of [[Aristotle]], told how the draining of marshes had made a particular locality more susceptible to freezing, and speculated that lands became warmer when the clearing of forests exposed them to sunlight. Renaissance and later scholars saw that [[deforestation]], [[irrigation]], and [[grazing]] had altered the lands around the Mediterranean since ancient times; they thought it plausible that these human interventions had affected the local weather.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Glacken |first=Clarence J. |title=Traces on the Rhodian Shore.

When these figures were analyzed, they showed many rises and dips, but no steady long-term change. By the end of the 19th century, scientific opinion had turned decisively against any belief in a human influence on climate. And whatever the regional effects, few imagined that humans could affect the climate of the planet as a whole.<ref name=\"aiphist2\"/>\n\n== Paleoclimate change and theories of its causes, 19th century ==\n[[File:Siebenschneiderstein 1.jpg|thumb|[[Glacial erratic|Erratics]], boulders deposited by glaciers far from any existing glaciers, led geologists to the conclusion that climate had changed in the past.]]\n{{Main|paleoclimatology|ice age|greenhouse effect}}\n\nFrom the mid-17th century, naturalists attempted to reconcile [[mechanical philosophy]] with theology, initially within a [[Ussher chronology|Biblical timescale]]. By the late 18th century, there was increasing acceptance of prehistoric epochs. Geologists found evidence of a succession of [[Geologic time scale|geological ages]] with changes in climate. There were various competing theories about these changes; [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] proposed that the Earth had begun as an incandescent globe and was very gradually cooling. [[James Hutton]], whose ideas of cyclic change over huge periods of time were later dubbed [[uniformitarianism]], was among those who found signs of past glacial activity in places too warm for [[glaciers]] in modern times.<ref name=\"Davis\">{{Cite book|last=Young |first=Davis A. |title=The biblical Flood: a case study of the Church's response to extrabiblical evidence |publisher=[[Eerdmans]] |location=Grand Rapids, Mich |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8028-0719-9 |url=http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p82.htm |accessdate=2008-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331124027/http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p82.htm |archivedate=31 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1815 [[Jean-Pierre Perraudin]] described for the first time how glaciers might be responsible for the giant boulders seen in alpine valleys. As he hiked in the [[Val de Bagnes]], he noticed giant granite rocks that were scattered around the narrow valley. He knew that it would take an exceptional force to move such large rocks. He also noticed how glaciers left stripes on the land, and concluded that it was the ice that had carried the boulders down into the valleys.<ref name=nasa-paleo>{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Paleoclimatology/paleoclimatology_intro.php |title=Paleoclimatology |author=Holli Riebeek |date=28 June 2005 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=1 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\nHis idea was initially met with disbelief.

Venetz convinced Charpentier, who in turn convinced the influential scientist [[Louis Agassiz]] that the glacial theory had merit.<ref name=nasa-paleo />\n\nAgassiz developed a theory of what he termed \"[[Ice Age]]\" \u2014 when glaciers covered Europe and much of North America. In 1837 Agassiz was the first to scientifically propose that the Earth had been subject to a past [[ice age]].<ref name=\"evans 1887\">[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/ncps:@field(DOCID+@lit(ABQ7578-0145-13))::|The E.P.

This was strongly opposed by [[Charles Lyell]]'s version of Hutton's uniformitarianism, and was gradually abandoned by Buckland and other catastrophist geologists. A field trip to the Alps with Agassiz in October 1838 convinced Buckland that features in Britain had been caused by glaciation, and both he and Lyell strongly supported the ice age theory which became widely accepted by the 1870s.<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n[[File:Fourier2.jpg|thumb|Joseph Fourier]]\nBefore the concept of ice ages was proposed, [[Joseph Fourier]] in 1824 reasoned on the basis of physics that Earth's atmosphere kept the planet warmer than would be the case in a vacuum.  Fourier recognized that the atmosphere transmitted [[visible light]] waves efficiently to the earth's surface. The earth then absorbed visible light and emitted [[infrared radiation]] in response, but the atmosphere did not transmit infrared efficiently, which therefore increased surface temperatures.  He also suspected that human activities could influence climate, although he focused primarily on land use changes.  In an 1827 paper Fourier stated, ''\"The establishment and progress of human societies, the action of natural forces, can notably change, and in vast regions, the state of the surface, the distribution of water and the great movements of the air. Such effects are able to make to vary, in the course of many centuries, the average degree of heat; because the analytic expressions contain coefficients relating to the state of the surface and which greatly influence the temperature.\"''<ref name=fourier1>{{cite web |url=http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/fourier_1827/fourier_1827.html |title=Translation by W M Connolley of: Fourier 1827: MEMOIRE sur les temperatures du globe terrestre et des espaces planetaires |author=William Connolley |accessdate=18 July 2009 }}</ref>\nThe physicist [[Claude Pouillet]] proposed in 1838 that water vapour and carbon dioxide might trap infrared and warm the atmosphere, but there was still no experimental evidence of these gases absorbing heat from thermal radiation.<ref name=\"Science Hist 1st believer\">{{cite web |author=Rudy M.

But that was only one of many possible causes. Another obvious possibility was [[solar variation]]. Shifts in [[ocean current]]s also might explain many climate changes. For changes over millions of years, the raising and lowering of mountain ranges would change patterns of both winds and ocean currents. Or perhaps the climate of a continent had not changed at all, but it had grown warmer or cooler because of [[true polar wander|polar wander]] (the North Pole shifting to where the Equator had been or the like). There were dozens of theories.\n\nFor example, in the mid 19th century, [[James Croll]] published calculations of how the gravitational pulls of the Sun, Moon, and planets subtly affect the Earth's motion and orientation. The inclination of the Earth\u2019s axis and the shape of its orbit around the Sun oscillate gently in cycles lasting tens of thousands of years. During some periods the Northern Hemisphere would get slightly less sunlight during the winter than it would get during other centuries. Snow would accumulate, reflecting sunlight and leading to a self-sustaining ice age.<ref name=\"Imbrie\" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Croll |first=James |title=Climate and time in their geological relations.

He also realized the cooling would increase snow and ice cover at high latitudes, making the planet reflect more sunlight and thus further cool down, as [[James Croll]] had hypothesized.

It was urged by Tyndall a half century ago and has been urged by others since. Recently it has been very effectively advocated by Dr. Arrhenius, who has taken a great step in advance of his predecessors in reducing his conclusions to definite quantitative terms deduced from observational data. [..] The functions of carbon dioxide. \u2014 By the investigations of Tyndall, Lecher and Pretner, Keller, Roentgen, and Arrhenius, it has been shown that the carbon dioxide and water vapor of the atmosphere have remarkable power of absorbing and temporarily retaining heat rays, while the oxygen, nitrogen, and argon of the atmosphere possess this power in a feeble degree only. It follows that the effect of the carbon dioxide and water vapor is to blanket the earth with a thermally absorbent envelope. [..] The general results assignable to a greatly increased or a greatly reduced quantity of atmospheric carbon dioxide and water may be summarized as follows:\n\n*a. An increase, by causing a larger absorption of the sun's radiant energy, raises the average temperature, while a reduction lowers it. The estimate of Dr. Arrhenius, based upon an elaborate mathematical discussion of the observations of Professor Langley, is that an increase of the carbon dioxide to the amount of two or three times the present content would elevate the average temperature 8\u00b0 or 9\u00b0 C. and would bring on a mild climate analogous to that which prevailed in the Middle Tertiary age.  On the other hand, a reduction of the quantity of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to an amount ranging from 55 to 62 per cent, of the present content, would reduce the average temperature 4 or 5 C, which would bring on a glaciation comparable to that of the Pleistocene period.\n*b. A second effect of increase and decrease in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide is the equalization, on the one hand, of surface temperatures, or their differentiation on the other. The temperature of the surface of the earth varies with latitude, altitude, the distribution of land and water, day and night, the seasons, and some other elements that may here be neglected. It is postulated that an increase in the thermal absorption of the atmosphere equalizes the temperature, and tends to eliminate the variations attendant on these contingencies. Conversely, a reduction of thermal atmospheric absorption tends to intensify all of these variations. A secondary effect of intensification of differences of temperature is an increase of atmospheric movements in the effort to restore equilibrium. Increased atmospheric movements, which are necessarily convectional, carry the warmer air to the surface of the atmosphere, and facilitate the discharge of the heat and thus intensify the primary effect. [..]\n\nIn the case of the outgoing rays, which are absorbed in much larger proportions than the incoming rays because they are more largely long-wave rays, the tables of Arrhenius show that the absorption is augmented by increase of carbonic acid in greater proportions in high latitudes than in low; for example, the increase of temperature for three times the present content of carbonic acid is 21.5 per cent, greater between 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 N. latitude than at the equator.\n\nIt now becomes necessary to assign agencies capable of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a rate sufficiently above the normal rate of supply, at certain times, to produce glaciation; and on the other hand, capable of restoring it to the atmosphere at certain other times in sufficient amounts to produce mild climates.\n\nWhen the temperature is rising after a glacial episode, dissociation is promoted, and the ocean gives forth its carbon dioxide at an increased rate, and thereby assists in accelerating the amelioration of climate.\n\nA study of the life of the geological periods seems to indicate that there were very notable fluctuations in the total mass of living matter. To be sure there was a reciprocal relation between the life of the land and that of the sea, so that when the latter was extended upon the continental platforms and greatly augmented, the former was contracted, but notwithstanding this it seems clear that the sum of life activity fluctuated notably during the ages. It is believed that on the whole it was greatest at the periods of sea extension and mild climates, and least at the times of disruption and climatic intensification. This factor then acted antithetically to the carbonic acid freeing previously noted, and, so far as it went, tended to offset its effects.\n\nIn periods of sea extension and of land reduction (base-level periods in particular), the habitat of shallow water lime-secreting life is concurrently extended, giving to the agencies that set carbon dioxide free accelerated activity, which is further aided by the consequent rising temperature which reduces the absorptive power of the ocean and increases dissociation. At the same time, the area of the land being diminished, a low consumption of carbon dioxide both in original decomposition of the silicates and in the solution of the limestones and dolomites obtains.\n\nThus the reciprocating agencies again conjoin, but now to increase the carbon dioxide of the air. These are the great and essential factors. They are modified by several subordinate agencies already mentioned, but the quantitative effect of these is thought to be quite insufficient to prevent very notable fluctuations in the atmospheric constitution.\n\nAs a result, it is postulated that geological history has been accentuated by an alternation of climatic episodes embracing, on the one hand, periods of mild, equable, moist climate nearly uniform for the whole globe; and on the other, periods when there were extremes of aridity and precipitation, and of heat and cold; these last denoted by deposits of salt and gypsum, of subaerial conglomerates, of red sandstones and shales, of arkose deposits, and occasionally by glaciation in low latitudes.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-30055497|author=Chamberlin, T.

Experimental attempts to measure infrared absorption in the laboratory seemed to show little differences resulted from increasing {{CO2}} levels, and also found significant overlap between absorption by {{CO2}} and absorption by water vapor, all of which suggested that increasing carbon dioxide emissions would have little climatic effect. These early experiments were later found to be insufficiently accurate, given the instrumentation of the time. Many scientists also thought that the oceans would quickly absorb any excess carbon dioxide.<ref name=aiphistory />\n\nOther theories of the causes of climate change fared no better. The principal advances were in observational [[paleoclimatology]], as scientists in various fields of [[geology]] worked out methods to reveal ancient climates.  [[Wilmot H. Bradley]] found that annual [[varve]]s of clay laid down in lake beds showed climate cycles. [[A. E. Douglass|Andrew Ellicott Douglass]] saw strong indications of climate change in [[tree rings]]. Noting that the rings were thinner in dry years, he reported climate effects from solar variations, particularly in connection with the 17th-century dearth of [[sunspots]] (the [[Maunder Minimum]]) noticed previously by [[William Herschel]] and others. Other scientists, however, found good reason to doubt that tree rings could reveal anything beyond random regional variations. The value of tree rings for climate study was not solidly established until the 1960s.<ref name=\"aipSun\">{{cite web |url=http://history.aip.org/climate/solar.htm |title=Changing Sun, Changing Climate |work=The Discovery of Global Warming | year=2011 |author=Spencer Weart}}</ref><ref name=\"Hufbauer\">{{cite book |last=Hufbauer |first=K. |title=Exploring the Sun: Solar Science since Galileo |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore, MD |year=1991 }}</ref>\n\nThrough the 1930s the most persistent advocate of a solar-climate connection was astrophysicist [[Charles Greeley Abbot]]. By the early 1920s, he had concluded that the [[solar constant|solar \"constant\"]] was misnamed: his observations showed large variations, which he connected with [[sunspots]] passing across the face of the Sun. He and a few others pursued the topic into the 1960s, convinced that sunspot variations were a main cause of climate change. Other scientists were skeptical.<ref name=\"aipSun\"/><ref name=\"Hufbauer\"/> Nevertheless, attempts to connect the [[solar cycle]] with climate cycles were popular in the 1920s and 1930s.

Some observations of [[varves]] (layers seen in the mud covering the bottom of lakes) matched the prediction of a [[Milankovitch cycle]] lasting about 21,000 years. However, most geologists dismissed the astronomical theory.

Climatologists also realized that little water vapor was present in the upper atmosphere.  Both developments showed that the {{CO2}} greenhouse effect would not be overwhelmed by water vapor.<ref name=aiphistory />\n\nIn 1955 [[Hans Suess]]'s [[carbon-14]] isotope analysis showed that {{CO2}} released from fossil fuels was not immediately absorbed by the ocean. In 1957, better understanding of ocean chemistry led [[Roger Revelle]] to a realization that the ocean surface layer had limited ability to absorb carbon dioxide, also predicting the rise in levels of {{CO2}} and later being proven by [[Charles David Keeling]].<ref>Revelle, Roger, and Hans E. Suess (1957). \"Carbon Dioxide Exchange between Atmosphere and Ocean and the Question of an Increase of Atmospheric {{CO2}} During the Past Decades.\" ''Tellus, 9:'' 18\u201327.</ref>  By the late 1950s, more scientists were arguing that carbon dioxide emissions could be a problem, with some projecting in 1959 that {{CO2}} would rise 25% by the year 2000, with potentially \"radical\" effects on climate.<ref name=aiphistory /> In 1960 [[Charles David Keeling]] demonstrated that the level of {{CO2}} in the atmosphere was in fact rising. Concern mounted year by year along with the rise of the \"[[Keeling Curve]]\" of atmospheric {{CO2}}.\n\nAnother clue to the nature of climate change came in the mid-1960s from analysis of deep-sea cores by [[Cesare Emiliani]] and analysis of ancient corals by [[Wallace Broecker]] and collaborators. Rather than four long [[ice ages]], they found a large number of shorter ones in a regular sequence. It appeared that the timing of ice ages was set by the small orbital shifts of the [[Milankovitch cycles]]. While the matter remained controversial, some began to suggest that the climate system is sensitive to small changes and can readily be flipped from a stable state into a different one.<ref name=\"aipCycles\"/>\n\nScientists meanwhile began using computers to develop more sophisticated versions of Arrhenius's calculations. In 1967, taking advantage of the ability of digital computers to integrate absorption curves numerically, [[Syukuro Manabe]] and Richard Wetherald made the first detailed calculation of the greenhouse effect incorporating convection (the \"Manabe-Wetherald one-dimensional radiative-convective model\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.aip.org/climate/GCM.htm |title=General Circulation Models of Climate |work=The Discovery of Global Warming | year=2011 |author=Spencer Weart}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Manabe S. |author2=Wetherald R.

Scientists were unsure whether the cooling effect of particulate pollution or warming effect of greenhouse gas emissions would predominate, but regardless, began to suspect that human emissions could be disruptive to climate in the 21st century if not sooner.  In his 1968 book ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] wrote, \"the greenhouse effect is being enhanced now by the greatly increased level of carbon dioxide...

In the late 19th century, scientists first argued that human emissions of [[greenhouse gases]] could change the [[climate]]. Many other theories of [[climate change]] were advanced, involving forces from [[volcanism]] to [[solar variation]]. Thomas Edison, pioneer of electrical technologies, voiced concern for climate change{{citation  needed|date=February 2020}} and support for renewable energy in the 1930s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/thomas-edison-champion-of-renewable-energy-1204180|title=Thomas Edison Saw the Value of Renewable Energy|last=West|first=Larry|website=ThoughtCo|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> In the 1960s, the warming effect of [[carbon dioxide]] gas became increasingly convincing. Some scientists also pointed out that human activities that generated atmospheric [[aerosols]] (e.g., \"pollution\") could have cooling effects as well.\n\nDuring the 1970s, scientific opinion increasingly favored the warming viewpoint. By the 1990s, as a result of improving fidelity of [[computer models]] and observational work confirming the [[Milankovitch theory]] of the ice ages, a consensus position formed: greenhouse gases were deeply involved in most climate changes and human-caused emissions were bringing discernible [[global warming]]. Since the 1990s, scientific research on climate change has included multiple disciplines and has expanded. Research has expanded our understanding of causal relations, links with historic data and ability to model climate change numerically.  Research during this period has been summarized in the Assessment Reports by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].\n\n[[Climate change (general concept)|Climate change]], broadly interpreted, is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. It may be a change in average weather conditions, or in the distribution of weather around the average conditions (such as more or fewer [[Effects of global warming#Extreme weather|extreme weather]] events). Climate change is caused by factors that include oceanic processes (such as oceanic circulation), biotic processes (e.g., plants), variations in [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]] received by Earth, [[plate tectonics]] and [[volcanism|volcanic eruptions]], and human-induced alterations of the natural world. The latter effect is currently causing global warming, and \"climate change\" is often used to describe human-specific impacts.\n\n== Regional changes, antiquity through 19th century ==\n{{See also|Holocene}}\nFrom ancient times, people suspected that the climate of a region could change over the course of centuries. For example, [[Theophrastus]], a pupil of [[Aristotle]], told how the draining of marshes had made a particular locality more susceptible to freezing, and speculated that lands became warmer when the clearing of forests exposed them to sunlight. Renaissance and later scholars saw that [[deforestation]], [[irrigation]], and [[grazing]] had altered the lands around the Mediterranean since ancient times; they thought it plausible that these human interventions had affected the local weather.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Glacken |first=Clarence J. |title=Traces on the Rhodian Shore.

When these figures were analyzed, they showed many rises and dips, but no steady long-term change. By the end of the 19th century, scientific opinion had turned decisively against any belief in a human influence on climate.

By the late 18th century, there was increasing acceptance of prehistoric epochs. Geologists found evidence of a succession of [[Geologic time scale|geological ages]] with changes in climate. There were various competing theories about these changes; [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] proposed that the Earth had begun as an incandescent globe and was very gradually cooling.

The earth then absorbed visible light and emitted [[infrared radiation]] in response, but the atmosphere did not transmit infrared efficiently, which therefore increased surface temperatures.  He also suspected that human activities could influence climate, although he focused primarily on land use changes.  In an 1827 paper Fourier stated, ''\"The establishment and progress of human societies, the action of natural forces, can notably change, and in vast regions, the state of the surface, the distribution of water and the great movements of the air.

But that was only one of many possible causes. Another obvious possibility was [[solar variation]]. Shifts in [[ocean current]]s also might explain many climate changes. For changes over millions of years, the raising and lowering of mountain ranges would change patterns of both winds and ocean currents. Or perhaps the climate of a continent had not changed at all, but it had grown warmer or cooler because of [[true polar wander|polar wander]] (the North Pole shifting to where the Equator had been or the like). There were dozens of theories.\n\nFor example, in the mid 19th century, [[James Croll]] published calculations of how the gravitational pulls of the Sun, Moon, and planets subtly affect the Earth's motion and orientation. The inclination of the Earth\u2019s axis and the shape of its orbit around the Sun oscillate gently in cycles lasting tens of thousands of years.

It was urged by Tyndall a half century ago and has been urged by others since. Recently it has been very effectively advocated by Dr. Arrhenius, who has taken a great step in advance of his predecessors in reducing his conclusions to definite quantitative terms deduced from observational data. [..] The functions of carbon dioxide. \u2014 By the investigations of Tyndall, Lecher and Pretner, Keller, Roentgen, and Arrhenius, it has been shown that the carbon dioxide and water vapor of the atmosphere have remarkable power of absorbing and temporarily retaining heat rays, while the oxygen, nitrogen, and argon of the atmosphere possess this power in a feeble degree only. It follows that the effect of the carbon dioxide and water vapor is to blanket the earth with a thermally absorbent envelope. [..] The general results assignable to a greatly increased or a greatly reduced quantity of atmospheric carbon dioxide and water may be summarized as follows:\n\n*a. An increase, by causing a larger absorption of the sun's radiant energy, raises the average temperature, while a reduction lowers it. The estimate of Dr. Arrhenius, based upon an elaborate mathematical discussion of the observations of Professor Langley, is that an increase of the carbon dioxide to the amount of two or three times the present content would elevate the average temperature 8\u00b0 or 9\u00b0 C. and would bring on a mild climate analogous to that which prevailed in the Middle Tertiary age.  On the other hand, a reduction of the quantity of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to an amount ranging from 55 to 62 per cent, of the present content, would reduce the average temperature 4 or 5 C, which would bring on a glaciation comparable to that of the Pleistocene period.\n*b. A second effect of increase and decrease in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide is the equalization, on the one hand, of surface temperatures, or their differentiation on the other. The temperature of the surface of the earth varies with latitude, altitude, the distribution of land and water, day and night, the seasons, and some other elements that may here be neglected. It is postulated that an increase in the thermal absorption of the atmosphere equalizes the temperature, and tends to eliminate the variations attendant on these contingencies. Conversely, a reduction of thermal atmospheric absorption tends to intensify all of these variations. A secondary effect of intensification of differences of temperature is an increase of atmospheric movements in the effort to restore equilibrium. Increased atmospheric movements, which are necessarily convectional, carry the warmer air to the surface of the atmosphere, and facilitate the discharge of the heat and thus intensify the primary effect. [..]\n\nIn the case of the outgoing rays, which are absorbed in much larger proportions than the incoming rays because they are more largely long-wave rays, the tables of Arrhenius show that the absorption is augmented by increase of carbonic acid in greater proportions in high latitudes than in low; for example, the increase of temperature for three times the present content of carbonic acid is 21.5 per cent, greater between 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 N. latitude than at the equator.\n\nIt now becomes necessary to assign agencies capable of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a rate sufficiently above the normal rate of supply, at certain times, to produce glaciation; and on the other hand, capable of restoring it to the atmosphere at certain other times in sufficient amounts to produce mild climates.\n\nWhen the temperature is rising after a glacial episode, dissociation is promoted, and the ocean gives forth its carbon dioxide at an increased rate, and thereby assists in accelerating the amelioration of climate.\n\nA study of the life of the geological periods seems to indicate that there were very notable fluctuations in the total mass of living matter. To be sure there was a reciprocal relation between the life of the land and that of the sea, so that when the latter was extended upon the continental platforms and greatly augmented, the former was contracted, but notwithstanding this it seems clear that the sum of life activity fluctuated notably during the ages. It is believed that on the whole it was greatest at the periods of sea extension and mild climates, and least at the times of disruption and climatic intensification. This factor then acted antithetically to the carbonic acid freeing previously noted, and, so far as it went, tended to offset its effects.\n\nIn periods of sea extension and of land reduction (base-level periods in particular), the habitat of shallow water lime-secreting life is concurrently extended, giving to the agencies that set carbon dioxide free accelerated activity, which is further aided by the consequent rising temperature which reduces the absorptive power of the ocean and increases dissociation. At the same time, the area of the land being diminished, a low consumption of carbon dioxide both in original decomposition of the silicates and in the solution of the limestones and dolomites obtains.\n\nThus the reciprocating agencies again conjoin, but now to increase the carbon dioxide of the air. These are the great and essential factors. They are modified by several subordinate agencies already mentioned, but the quantitative effect of these is thought to be quite insufficient to prevent very notable fluctuations in the atmospheric constitution.\n\nAs a result, it is postulated that geological history has been accentuated by an alternation of climatic episodes embracing, on the one hand, periods of mild, equable, moist climate nearly uniform for the whole globe; and on the other, periods when there were extremes of aridity and precipitation, and of heat and cold; these last denoted by deposits of salt and gypsum, of subaerial conglomerates, of red sandstones and shales, of arkose deposits, and occasionally by glaciation in low latitudes.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-30055497|author=Chamberlin, T.

Experimental attempts to measure infrared absorption in the laboratory seemed to show little differences resulted from increasing {{CO2}} levels, and also found significant overlap between absorption by {{CO2}} and absorption by water vapor, all of which suggested that increasing carbon dioxide emissions would have little climatic effect. These early experiments were later found to be insufficiently accurate, given the instrumentation of the time. Many scientists also thought that the oceans would quickly absorb any excess carbon dioxide.<ref name=aiphistory />\n\nOther theories of the causes of climate change fared no better. The principal advances were in observational [[paleoclimatology]], as scientists in various fields of [[geology]] worked out methods to reveal ancient climates.  [[Wilmot H. Bradley]] found that annual [[varve]]s of clay laid down in lake beds showed climate cycles. [[A. E. Douglass|Andrew Ellicott Douglass]] saw strong indications of climate change in [[tree rings]]. Noting that the rings were thinner in dry years, he reported climate effects from solar variations, particularly in connection with the 17th-century dearth of [[sunspots]] (the [[Maunder Minimum]]) noticed previously by [[William Herschel]] and others. Other scientists, however, found good reason to doubt that tree rings could reveal anything beyond random regional variations.

In 1957, better understanding of ocean chemistry led [[Roger Revelle]] to a realization that the ocean surface layer had limited ability to absorb carbon dioxide, also predicting the rise in levels of {{CO2}} and later being proven by [[Charles David Keeling]].<ref>Revelle, Roger, and Hans E.

Concern mounted year by year along with the rise of the \"[[Keeling Curve]]\" of atmospheric {{CO2}}.\n\nAnother clue to the nature of climate change came in the mid-1960s from analysis of deep-sea cores by [[Cesare Emiliani]] and analysis of ancient corals by [[Wallace Broecker]] and collaborators. Rather than four long [[ice ages]], they found a large number of shorter ones in a regular sequence. It appeared that the timing of ice ages was set by the small orbital shifts of the [[Milankovitch cycles]]. While the matter remained controversial, some began to suggest that the climate system is sensitive to small changes and can readily be flipped from a stable state into a different one.<ref name=\"aipCycles\"/>\n\nScientists meanwhile began using computers to develop more sophisticated versions of Arrhenius's calculations. In 1967, taking advantage of the ability of digital computers to integrate absorption curves numerically, [[Syukuro Manabe]] and Richard Wetherald made the first detailed calculation of the greenhouse effect incorporating convection (the \"Manabe-Wetherald one-dimensional radiative-convective model\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.aip.org/climate/GCM.htm |title=General Circulation Models of Climate |work=The Discovery of Global Warming | year=2011 |author=Spencer Weart}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Manabe S. |author2=Wetherald R.

Scientists were unsure whether the cooling effect of particulate pollution or warming effect of greenhouse gas emissions would predominate, but regardless, began to suspect that human emissions could be disruptive to climate in the 21st century if not sooner.

(Some officials with long names would have their name in two rows, the most notable example being [[Andy Van Hellemond]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hockey Hall of Fame|title=Legends of Hockey - Spotlight - One on One with Luc Robitaille|url=http://www.hhof.com/graphspot/one_robitaille03.jpg|website=Hockey Hall of Fame|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref>) However, in 1994, NHL officials returned to wearing solely numbers on their shirts, a procedure adopted by other sports leagues.\n\nIn the early days of hockey when the NHL was formed (1917), the referees would be clad in a vest and tie along with their pants and carry a bell, not a whistle, to stop the game in progress.   In those days, penalties were assessed more on common sense rather than following strict rules, and the official would deem what was allowed and not, as well as the length of the penalties.\n\nLater, NHL referees wore cream-colored sweaters over a shirt and tie, from the 1930s to the early 1950s. They then briefly wore orange sweaters with half-zip fronts (and without neckties), until the black-and-white-striped jersey was introduced in 1955.<ref name=NYer/>\n\n=== Referees ===\nA ''referee'' is responsible for the general supervision of the game and  can be identified by the red or orange armbands. Under most officiating systems, the referee is the only official with the authority to assess [[Penalty (hockey)|penalties]] for violations of the rules. However, the linesmen can report a variety of penalties, such as ''[[Too many men on the ice]]'' and major penalties, to the referee, who may then assess the penalty. The referee also conducts the opening [[face-off]] in each period and face-offs that follow after a goal is scored, which are done at the centre ice face-off dot.\n\n=== Linesmen ===\n''Linesmen'' are primarily responsible for watching for violations involving the [[red line (hockey)|centre line]] and the [[blue line (hockey)|blue line]]. Such infractions include [[icing (ice hockey)|icing]] and [[Offside (ice hockey)|offside]], after which the linesmen conduct [[faceoff]]s. They are also expected to break up scuffles, fistfights and other altercations that occur during the game. In some leagues, the rules allow linesmen to call some penalties (such as ''Too many men on the ice''), while others only allow them to report the infraction to the referee.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/sports/hockey/20lines.html?ref=sports  |last=Caldwell |first=Dave |title=N.H.L. Linesmen Are Unseen and Often Hurt |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 20, 2009 |accessdate=June 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Assistant referees ====\nIn some leagues, the linesmen are given the title of assistant referee. When given this title, they are given more responsibility to stop play and to call penalties that the referee may not see. The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] previously used this designation prior to altering its officiating systems in 2006.\n\n=== On-ice officiating systems ===\n* The ''three-official system'' uses one referee and two linesmen. This is the most commonly used system.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The NHL previously used this system until changing to the four-official system in the late 1990s. The highest level for this system is the [[ECHL]], which does official development for the NHL.\n[[File:Montreal - Burlington 3 decembre 2011 021.jpg|thumb|These officials are working in a four-official system; the two middle officials are the referees, identifiable by their orange armbands]]\n* The ''four-official system'' adds a second referee for a total of two referees and two linesmen. In this system, each referee works either the lead/front or the trail/back position. The lead position is normally in corner of the end zone, while the trail position is the neutral zone, diagonally opposite each other. As the game transitions from one end of the ice to the other, the lead becomes the trail and vice versa. The four-official system is used in the NHL, [[American Hockey League|AHL]], and at other high levels, such as major junior, junior 'A', and top European leagues. In 2007-2008, college hockey used the system in some games on a trial basis.<ref>[http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/articles/index.cfm?id=52965&section=sports College men's hockey: Early reviews favor ref experiment] Duluth News Tribune (October 25, 2007){{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref> The IIHF first implemented this system for men\u2019s games at the [[2008 IIHF World Championship]]<ref>[http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/article/2010-olympic-format-decided.html IIHF.com-2010 Olympic Format decided] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215153608/http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/article/2010-olympic-format-decided.html |date=February 15, 2010 }}</ref> and for women\u2019s games at the [[2014\u201315 IIHF European Women's Champions Cup]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 2014|editor-last=Lichtner|editor-first=Horst|editor2-last=Merk|editor2-first=Martin|title=EWCC finalists named|url=http://webarchive.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/The_IIHF/IIHF_IceTimes_December2014.pdf|journal=IIHF Ice Times|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]|volume=18|issue=4|pages=15|via=}}</ref>; the four-man officiating system has subsequently been the standard in IIHF competition. The NCAA voted in July 2012 to make the four-official system mandatory for men's games starting in the 2013-14 season.\n* In the ''two-official system'', each official acts as both referee and linesman. Each official has the responsibility to call both penalties and line violations. In this system, neither official wears red or orange armbands or both will wear one armband each. This is used at lower levels of youth hockey and in most adult recreational leagues.\n* In the ''2-1 system'', (the least common of the on-ice official systems), there are two referees and one linesman. There are a variety of ways to divide the responsibilities between the referees and linesmen. Typically, the back referee is responsible for making the initial call at the blue line when the puck first enters the zone, and after that the linesman takes over.  This system is currently being used in Division III NCAA levels in the United States, and in National Federation of State High School Associations sanctioned games.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Caufield|first=T.G.|title=Feedback and Goal-Setting with Professional Hockey Referees|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International|year=1987}}</ref> \n* The ''1-1 system'' (sometimes called ''Texas two-man'') uses one referee and one linesman. This is usually seen in adult recreational leagues (sometimes called \"beer league\" - C, D and I divisions) as a cost-saving measure; the pace of play at this level is typically slow enough for the two officials to cover events between them. This can also be an informal system used ''ad hoc'' when one of the officials does not show up for a game scheduled to use the three-official system, or when an official is hurt during a game. The referee in this system also has the duties of a linesman.\n* Beginner-level adult leagues sometimes will only use a single on-ice official who is responsible for calling line violations and penalties. The official will not usually wear orange or red armbands in this system.\n\n== Off-ice officials ==\n''Off-ice officials'', with the exception of the video goal judge in professional leagues, do not have any direct impact on the outcome of the game. They serve primarily administrative and advisory roles.\n\n=== Goal judge ===\nThe ''goal judge'' determines whether a player has scored a goal by watching to see if the puck has crossed the goal line completely. They act only in an advisory role; the referee has the sole authority to award goals, and thus can override the opinion of the goal judge.\n\nOne goal judge is positioned outside the rink directly behind each goal net. For arenas so equipped, the goal judge turns on a red light behind the goal to signal a score. The red goal light, and the adjacent green light are connected to the arena game clock.  When the clock operator stops the clock, or the time remaining expires, the red light is not able to be activated. In the NHL, the green light is activated only when the game clock reads 00.0 seconds: in lower levels the green light may be linked to the scoreboard's siren or turn on whenever time is stopped. \n\nIn games governed by the IIHF, goal judges wear the same black-and-white striped shirts as on-ice officials.<ref>{{cite web|last1=IIHF|title=Section III - iihf - ice hockey / 2014 championships|url=http://stats.iihf.com/hockey/rules/img/sec3.pdf|website=IIHF International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref> This is not the case for goal judges in North America for games under different hockey codes: their goal judges are usually dressed in apparel bearing a league or hockey association logo, such as sport coats or athletic jackets.\n\nIn the mid 2000s, the National Hockey League relocated goal judges to higher locations (most commonly the press box, a catwalk or the lower section of the upper deck) with wireless signals.  The idea was to allow teams to sell the prime seats, but also to give officials a better view of the action as to be able to reject goals if violations (illegally kicked in, player in the crease, offside) took place.  However, with the expansion of video replay and the addition of a second referee on the ice, the role of the goal judge became relegated to activating the goal lights.  The league ceased using goal judges after the 2018\u20132019 season.  The video goal judge now activates the goal lights from the video replay booth.<ref>{{cite News|url=https://edmontonsun.com/opinion/columnists/jones-nhl-eliminates-traditional-lighters-of-lamps|title=NHL eliminates traditional lighters of lamps|publisher=Edmonton Sun|date=27 September 2019|last=Jones|first=Terry}}</ref>\n\nGoal judges were first used around 1877 in Montreal, and were initially called umpires.<ref name=\"Maclean's goal judge\">{{cite journal |first= Colin |last= Campbell |date= 8 November 2007 |title= The Goal Judge; 1877\u20132007 |journal= [[Maclean's]] |page= 178 |url= http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=2007118_51645_51645 |accessdate= 23 April 2009 |quote= The hockey goal judge, or umpire as he was first known, came into being some time around 1877 in Montreal. |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120306022849/http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=2007118_51645_51645 |archivedate= 6 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Video goal judge ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe [[Video referee|video goal judge]] [[Instant replay|reviews replays]] of disputed goals. As the referee does not have access to television monitors, the video goal judge's decision in disputed goals is taken as final. In the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], goals may only be reviewed in the following situations: puck crossing the goal line completely and before time expired, puck in the net prior to goal frame being dislodged, puck being directed into the net by hand or foot, puck deflected into the net off an official, and puck deflected into the goal by a high stick (stick above the goal) by an attacking player. All NHL goals are subject to review, and although most arenas have a video goal judge, officials from the NHL Hockey Operations Department, located in the Situation Room (also known as the \"War Room\") at the NHL office in [[Toronto]], will often make the final decision. Arena video goal judges are used in case the communication link with Toronto is not working, and also for other situations such as timing or proper statistic attribution.\n\n=== Official scorer ===\nThe ''official scorer'' keeps the official record of the game. He is responsible for obtaining a list of eligible players from both teams prior to the start of the game. He awards [[Point (hockey)|point]]s for [[Goal (hockey)|goal]]s and [[Assist (hockey)|assist]]s, and his decision in this regard is final. The official scorer typically sits in an elevated position away from the edge of the rink.\n\n=== Penalty timekeeper ===\nThe ''penalty [[timekeeper]]'' records the penalties imposed by the referee.

{"title_page": "Ralph Rokeby (died 1596)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2017}}\n'''Ralph Rokeby''' (c.1527\u20131596) was an English [[barrister]] and judge who held high office in [[Ireland]].\n\nHe was born at Mortham in [[Yorkshire]], the second son of Thomas Rokeby and his wife  Jane Constable; Jane was the  daughter of Sir [[Robert Constable]] of [[Cliffe, Selby]], who was  executed in 1537 for his part in the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], and his wife Jane Ingleby. Ralph was educated at the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[Lincoln's Inn]], where he was [[called to the Bar]].\n\nHe was first sent to Ireland in the service of Queen [[Elizabeth I]]  in 1566; he  was recalled  to England early in 1569. At the end of the same year  he was appointed the first [[Chief Justice of Connacht]], with the task of introducing the  system of [[common law]] into the Province of [[Connacht]]. He found it a discouraging job, writing to [[Lord Burghley]] that the people of Connacht \"were unwilling to embrace justice\". What was needed, in his view,  was the subjugation of the province by military force: if this did not happen,  and quickly, then  the English  must  soon bid  \"farewell to Ireland\". Powers to impose [[martial law]] in the province and to pursue the King's enemies with \"fire and sword\" were eventually  granted, in 1604,  some years after Rokeby's death,  to  the Chief Justice's superior,  the [[Lord President of Connaught]].\n\nRokeby earned the  good regard of [[Adam Loftus (bishop)|Adam Loftus]], the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], and  of  MP  [[William Fitzwilliam (Lord Deputy)|William FitzWilliam]], the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], both of whom suggested that he might in due course  replace Loftus as Lord Chancellor. He returned to England for good in about  1577 and became [[Master of Requests (England)|Master of Requests]] about 1586.  He was also employed on several commissions for the detection of [[recusants]] and traitors, including those which indicted [[William Parry (spy)|William Parry]] and [[Anthony Babington]]. He sat as a judge at  numerous [[treason]] trials, notably those of [[Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel|Philip, Earl of Arundel]], [[Sir John Perrot]], [[Rodrigo Lopez (physician)|Dr Lopez]] and [[Patrick O'Collun]]. He was a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn and Master of [[St Katharine's by the Tower|St Katherine's Hospital]]  near the [[Tower of London]].\n\nHe died on 14 June 1596  and was buried in [[St Andrew, Holborn]]. He never married, though  since he obtained leave of absence  to return to England to  get married, he was  then presumably intending to do so.  Although  he had several siblings,  he  chose to leave  his property to a variety of [[charities]].\n\nA Ralph Rokeby represented [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] in the English Parliament of 1571, and has been tentatively identified with this man. However, there is no firm evidence for this identification, and it is equally likely to have been his relative, [[Ralph Rokeby (died 1595)]], a lawyer and historian.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/rokeby-ralph ROKEBY, Ralph.] Published in The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1558-1603, ed.
