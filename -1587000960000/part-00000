Unconfirmed acceptance credit means that the buyer takes the risk that payment will not be made, due to any number of contingencies such as shipment non-delivery, confiscation by customs authorities, or any other problems.  Confirmed acceptance credit means that the bank upon which the credit has been issued, essentially guarantees payment as long as the terms of the letter of credit have been complied with.\n\nConfirmed acceptance credit is more expensive to establish than unconfirmed acceptance credit because the issuing bank is effectively guaranteeing payment.  It also transfers the risk of non-delivery to the recipient, because once the seller [[Free on board|places the product in the hands of the shipping company]], the seller has complied and will be paid; if the shipment does not arrive, is delayed, or other problems occur, the buyer cannot stop payment or otherwise prevent redemption of the acceptance credit.\n\nBanks may also create an acceptance credit facility allowing a company to issue time drafts not linked to specific shipments in order to provide general working capital finance. Under the arrangement the issuing company presents bills of exchange to the bank for acceptance, confirmation and sale at a discount to face value (representing the finance cost until maturity). The discounted sum is made available to the issuing company until the bill's maturity when it is obliged to repay the bill's full face value to the bank.

In his home country the United Kingdom it reached number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and also charted in the top 10 in more than twenty nations around the world.

He dealt with the grief of his son's death by cowriting \"Tears in Heaven\" for the soundtrack with [[Will Jennings]]. In an interview in 1992, Clapton said of the song, \"It was in the back of my head but it didn\u2019t really have a reason for being until I was scoring this movie ... then it sort of had a reason to be.

He told me that he had admired the work I did with [[Steve Winwood]] and finally there was nothing else but to do as he requested, despite the sensitivity of the subject.

He dealt with the grief of his son's death by cowriting \"Tears in Heaven\" for the soundtrack with [[Will Jennings]]. In an interview in 1992, Clapton said of the song, \"It was in the back of my head but it didn\u2019t really have a reason for being until I was scoring this movie ... then it sort of had a reason to be. And it is a little ambiguous because it could be taken to be about Conor but it also is meant to be part of the film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmmBynDJzWw|title=Eric Clapton : Sue Lawley 1992|website=YouTube|accessdate=26 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with Daphne Barak, Clapton said: \"I almost subconsciously used music for myself as a healing agent, and lo and behold, it worked...

He told me that he had admired the work I did with [[Steve Winwood]] and finally there was nothing else but to do as he requested, despite the sensitivity of the subject. This is a song so personal and so sad that it is unique in my experience of writing songs.{{ref|songfacts}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==Release==\nShortly after the single was released, Clapton recorded the song in front of an audience at [[Bray Studios]], Berkshire, England as part of a set for ''[[MTV Unplugged]],''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/unplugged-r4050|title=MTV Unplugged - Eric Clapton &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]|date=1992-08-18|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2014-02-16}}</ref> released as ''[[Unplugged (Eric Clapton album)|Unplugged]].''
