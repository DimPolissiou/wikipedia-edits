Crosstalk is usually caused by undesired [[capacitive coupling|capacitive]], [[inductive coupling|inductive]], or [[conductive coupling]] from one circuit or channel to another.\n\nCrosstalk is a significant issue in [[structured cabling]], [[audio electronics]], [[integrated circuit design]], [[wireless communication]] and other [[communications system]]s.\n\n==Mechanisms==\n===Electromagnetic field interference===\nEvery electrical signal is associated with a varying field, whether electrical, magnetic or travelling. Where these fields overlap, they interfere with each other's signal. For example if two wires next to each other carry different signals, the currents in them will create magnetic fields which will induce a smaller signal in the neighbouring wire.\n\n===Common impedance coupling===\nIn electrical circuits sharing a common signal return path, electrical impedance in the return path creates common impedance coupling between the signals, resulting in crosstalk.<ref>[http://learnemc.com/common-impedance-coupling LearnEMC Web Site: Common-Impedance Coupling]</ref><ref>K.-H.

Signals traveling through adjacent pairs of wire create magnetic fields which interact with each other, inducing interference in the neighboring pair. The pair causing the interference is called the \u201cdisturbing pair\u201d, while the pair experiencing the interference is the \u201cdisturbed pair\u201d.\n\n;Near end crosstalk (NEXT):  NEXT is a measure of the ability of a cable to reject crosstalk, so the higher the NEXT value, the greater the rejection of crosstalk at the local connection. It is referred to as Near End because the interference between the two signals in the cable is measured at the same end of the cable as the interfering transmitter. The NEXT value for a given cable type is generally expressed in decibels per feet or decibels per 1000 feet and varies with the frequency of transmission. General specifications for cabling (such as CAT 5) usually include the minimum NEXT values.<ref name=\"lanshack\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lanshack.com/cat5e-tutorial.aspx |title=Category 5 / 5E & Cat 6 Cabling Tutorial and FAQ's |publisher=lanshack.com |accessdate=2013-01-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117171629/http://www.lanshack.com/cat5e-tutorial.aspx |archivedate=2013-01-17 }}</ref>\n\n;{{Anchor|PSNEXT}}Power sum near end crosstalk (PSNEXT)\n:PSNEXT is a NEXT measurement which includes the sum of crosstalk contributions from all adjacent pairs as an algebraic sum of the NEXT of the three wire pairs as they affect the fourth pair in a four-pair cable (e.g., Category 6 cable).<ref name=\"lanshack\"/> The Superior Modular Products White paper<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superiormod.com/smp/pages/support/White%20Paper%20-%20RJ21X.pdf |title=Component Level PowerSum Compliance and RJ21X Connectivity Solutions (Superior Modular Products White paper) |accessdate=2008-09-13 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716043452/http://www.superiormod.com/smp/pages/support/White%20Paper%20-%20RJ21X.pdf |archivedate=July 16, 2006 }}</ref> states that the testing process for PSNEXT consists of measuring all pair-to-pair crosstalk combinations and then summing all of the values for each pair.

The episode is unusual in his body of work, in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later, more \"mature\" films. After this, and an episode of ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'', Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]'' called \"[[L.A. 2017]]\". This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract. He did another segment on ''Night Gallery'' and did some work for shows such as ''[[Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law]]'' and ''The Psychiatrist'', before landing the first series episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' (previous episodes were actually TV films).\n\nBased on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films. The first was a [[Richard Matheson]] adaptation called ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]''. The film is about a psychotic [[Peterbilt 281]] [[tanker truck]] driver who chases the terrified driver ([[Dennis Weaver]]) of a small [[Plymouth Valiant]] and tries to run him off the road. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic [[Dilys Powell]] was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (''[[Something Evil]]'') was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called ''Savage'', starring [[Martin Landau]]. Spielberg's debut full-length feature film was ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that \"a major new director is on the horizon.\"<ref name=McBride />{{rp|223}} However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.\n\nStudio producers [[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] offered Spielberg the director's chair for ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', a thriller-horror film based on the [[Peter Benchley]] novel [[Jaws (novel)|about an enormous killer shark]]. Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible. Despite the film's ultimate, enormous success, it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs. But Spielberg persevered and finished the film. It was an enormous hit, winning three Academy Awards (for editing, original score and sound) and grossing more than $470&nbsp;million worldwide at the box office. It also set the domestic record for box office gross, leading to what the press described as \"Jawsmania.\"<ref name=McBride />{{rp|248}} ''Jaws'' made Spielberg a household name and one of America's youngest multi-millionaires, allowing him a great deal of autonomy for his future projects.<ref name=McBride />{{rp|250}} It was nominated for Best Picture and featured Spielberg's first of three collaborations with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]].\n\nRejecting offers to direct ''[[Jaws 2]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=John|year=1997|title=Steven Spielberg: The Unauthorised Biography|location=London|publisher=Harper Collins|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780006384441/page/145 145]|isbn=978-0-00-638444-1|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780006384441/page/145}}</ref> ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]], which became ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, ''Close Encounters'' was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other [[Academy Awards]] nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', a big-budgeted World War&nbsp;II farce, was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4&nbsp;million worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics.<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1979/01941.php \"1941, Box Office Information.\"] ''The Numbers'', September 27, 2012.</ref>\n\nSpielberg then revisited his ''Close Encounters'' project and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released ''Close Encounters: The Special Edition'' in 1980. For this, Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also, at the behest of Columbia, and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film, shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film (a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery). Nevertheless, the re-release was a moderate success, while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending.\n\n===1980s===\nNext, Spielberg teamed with ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator and friend [[George Lucas]] on an action adventure film, ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', the first of the [[Indiana Jones]] films. The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by [[Harrison Ford]] (whom Lucas had previously cast in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' films as [[Han Solo]]). The film was considered an homage to the cliffhanger serials of the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]]. It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture). ''Raiders'' is still considered a landmark example of the action-adventure genre. The film also led to Ford's casting in [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blade Runner|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/blade-runner/wikipedia/casting-and-characters/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820185400/https://www.gradesaver.com/blade-runner/wikipedia/casting-and-characters/|archivedate=August 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nA year later, Spielberg returned to the science fiction genre with ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. It was the story of a young boy and the alien he befriends, who was accidentally left behind by his companions and is attempting to return home. ''E.T.'' went on to become the top-grossing film of all time.

Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford, the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script. This film and the Spielberg-produced ''[[Gremlins]]'' led to the creation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13 rating]] due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences. In spite of this, ''Temple of Doom'' is rated PG by the MPAA, even though it is the darkest and, possibly, most violent Indy film. Nonetheless, the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984.

However, Spielberg did not get a Best Director nomination.\n\nIn 1987, as China began opening to Western capital investment, Spielberg shot the first American film in Shanghai since the 1930s, an adaptation of [[J. G. Ballard]]'s autobiographical novel ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', starring [[John Malkovich]] and a young [[Christian Bale]]. The film garnered much praise from critics and was nominated for several Oscars, but did not yield substantial box office revenues. Reviewer [[Andrew Sarris]] called it the best film of the year and later included it among the best films of the decade.<ref>{{cite web| title = Andrew Sarris' Top 10 lists 1958\u20132005| url = http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/sarris.html#y1977| accessdate = October 21, 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20010210193008/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/sarris.html#y1977| archive-date = February 10, 2001| url-status=dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref> Spielberg was also a co-producer of the 1987 film ''[[Batteries Not Included|*batteries not included]]''.\n\nAfter two forays into more serious dramatic films, Spielberg then directed the third Indiana Jones film, 1989's ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. Once again teaming up with Lucas and Ford, Spielberg also cast actor [[Sean Connery]] in a supporting role as Indy's father. The film earned generally positive reviews and was another box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film worldwide that year; its total box office receipts even topped those of Tim Burton's much-anticipated film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', which had been the bigger hit domestically. Also in 1989, he re-united with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] for the romantic comedy-drama ''[[Always (1989 film)|Always]]'', about a daredevil pilot who extinguishes forest fires. Spielberg's first romantic film, ''Always'' was only a moderate success and had mixed reviews.\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:Steven Spielberg in 1990.jpg|thumb|left|Spielberg in March 1990]]\nIn 1991, Spielberg directed ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', about a middle-aged [[Peter Pan]], played by [[Robin Williams]], who returns to [[Neverland]]. Despite innumerable rewrites and creative changes coupled with mixed reviews, the film proved popular with audiences, making over $300&nbsp;million worldwide (from a $70&nbsp;million budget).\n\nIn 1993, Spielberg returned to the adventure genre with the film version of [[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', about a theme park with genetically engineered dinosaurs. With revolutionary special effects provided by friend [[George Lucas]]'s [[Industrial Light & Magic]] company, the film would eventually become the highest-grossing film of all time (at the worldwide box office) with $914.7&nbsp;million. This would be the third time that one of Spielberg's films became the highest-grossing film ever.\n\nSpielberg's next film, ''[[Schindler's List]]'', was based on the true story of [[Oskar Schindler]], a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust.<ref>The screenplay, adapted from [[Thomas Keneally]]'s novel, was originally in the hands of fellow director [[Martin Scorsese]], but Spielberg negotiated with Scorsese to trade scripts. (At the time, Spielberg held the script for a remake of ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]''.)</ref> ''Schindler's List'' earned Spielberg his first [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (it also won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]). With the film a huge success at the box office, Spielberg used the profits to set up the [[Shoah Foundation]], a non-profit organization that archives filmed testimony of Holocaust survivors. In 1997, the [[American Film Institute]] listed it among the 10 Greatest American Films ever Made (#9) which moved up to (#8) when the list was remade in 2007.\n\nIn 1994, Spielberg took a hiatus from directing to spend more time with his family and build his new studio, [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]],<ref>{{cite magazine|author = Army Archered|title = Spielberg to take break after completing 'List'|magazine = Variety|date = June 17, 1993|url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862199.html?categoryid=2&cs=1&query=dark+AND+angel|accessdate = February 11, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011203554/http://variety.com/article/VR1117862199.html?categoryid=2&cs=1&query=dark+AND+angel|archive-date = October 11, 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref> with partners [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] and [[David Geffen]]. In 1996, he directed the sequel to 1993's ''Jurassic Park'' with ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', which generated over $618&nbsp;million worldwide despite mixed reviews, and was the second biggest film of 1997 behind [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (which topped the original ''Jurassic Park'' to become the new recordholder for box office receipts).\n[[File:Steven Spielberg - GianAngelo Pistoia 1.jpg|thumb|right|Spielberg receiving the [[Golden Lion]] by Italian filmmaker [[Gillo Pontecorvo]] at the [[50th Venice International Film Festival]], 1993]]\n\nHis next film, ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', was based on a true story (like ''Schindler's List''), specifically about an African slave rebellion. Despite decent reviews from critics, it did not do well at the box office.

Miller ([[Tom Hanks]]) sent to bring home a [[paratrooper]] whose three older brothers were killed in the same twenty-four hours, June 5\u20136, of the Normandy landing. The film was a huge box office success, grossing over $481&nbsp;million worldwide and was the biggest film of the year at the North American box office (worldwide it made second place after Michael Bay's ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''). Spielberg won his second Academy Award for his direction. The film's graphic, realistic depiction of combat violence influenced later war films such as ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' and ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]''. The film was also the first major hit for DreamWorks, which co-produced the film with [[Paramount Pictures]] (as such, it was Spielberg's first release from the latter that was not part of the ''Indiana Jones'' series). Later, Spielberg and [[Tom Hanks]] produced a [[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|TV mini-series]] based on [[Stephen Ambrose]]'s book ''[[Band of Brothers (book)|Band of Brothers]]''. The ten-part [[HBO]] mini-series follows Easy Company of the [[101st Airborne Division]]'s 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The series won a number of awards at the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]].\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2001, Spielberg filmed fellow director and friend [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s final project, ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' which Kubrick was unable to begin during his lifetime. A futuristic film about a humanoid [[android (robot)|android]] longing for love, ''A.I.'' featured groundbreaking visual effects and a multi-layered, allegorical storyline, adapted by Spielberg himself. Though the film's reception in the US was relatively muted, it performed better overseas for a worldwide total box office gross of $236&nbsp;million.\n\nSpielberg and actor [[Tom Cruise]] collaborated for the first time for the futuristic [[neo-noir]] ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', based upon [[The Minority Report|the science fiction short story]] written by [[Philip K. Dick]] about a Washington D.C. police captain in the year 2054 who has been foreseen to murder a man he has not yet met. The film received strong reviews with the review tallying website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] giving it a 92% approval rating, reporting that 206 out of the 225 reviews they tallied were positive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/minority_report/|title=Minority Report|last=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|website=|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> The film earned over $358&nbsp;million worldwide. [[Roger Ebert]], who named it the best film of 2002, praised its breathtaking vision of the future as well as for the way Spielberg blended [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] with live-action.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020621/REVIEWS/206210304/1023|title=Minority Report|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=June 21, 2002|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=April 10, 2018|authorlink=Roger Ebert}}</ref>\n\nSpielberg's 2002 film ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' is about the daring adventures of a youthful con artist (played by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]). It earned [[Christopher Walken]] an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. The film is known for [[John Williams]]'s score and its unique [[title sequence]].

It received mixed reviews but performed relatively well at the box office. In 2005, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine ranked Spielberg number one on a list of the greatest film directors of all time.\n\nAlso in 2005, Spielberg directed a modern adaptation of ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' (a co-production of Paramount and DreamWorks), based on the H. G. Wells book of the same name (Spielberg had been a huge fan of the book and the original 1953 film). It starred Tom Cruise and [[Dakota Fanning]], and, as with past Spielberg films, [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) provided the [[visual effects]]. Unlike ''E.T.'' and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', which depicted friendly alien visitors, ''War of the Worlds'' featured violent invaders. The film was another huge box office smash, grossing over $591&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\nSpielberg's film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', about the events following the 1972 [[Munich Massacre]] of Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games, was his second film essaying Jewish relations in the world (the first being ''Schindler's List''). The film is based on ''[[Vengeance (Jonas book)|Vengeance]]'', a book by Canadian journalist [[George Jonas]]. It was previously adapted into the 1986 made-for-TV film ''[[Sword of Gideon]]''. The film received strong critical praise, but underperformed at the U.S. and world box-office; it remains one of Spielberg's most controversial films to date.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Yossi Melman and Steven Hartov|date=January 17, 2006|title=Munich: Fact and Fantasy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1687815,00.html|publisher=The Guardian Unlimited|volume=|accessdate=April 10, 2018|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> ''Munich'' received five Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture, Film Editing, Original Music Score (by John Williams), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Director for Spielberg.

Most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. <!-- This is especially evident in the [[Indiana Jones]] series. : Archaeologist, adventurer and relic hunter is not really an \"ordinary character\"-->In an [[American Film Institute|AFI]] interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films. Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood,<ref name=\"McBride\">{{cite book| last = McBride| first = Joseph| title = Steven Spielberg| publisher = Faber and Faber|year=1997| isbn = 978-0-571-19177-2}}</ref> and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge.<ref>{{cite book| title = E.T. DVD Production Notes Booklet| publisher = Universal|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nA strong consistent [[theme (literature)|theme]] in his family-friendly work is a childlike sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' and ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]''. According to Warren Buckland,<ref>Directed by Steven Spielberg: Poetics of the Contemporary Hollywood Blockbuster</ref> these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'', ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', ''[[The Terminal]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', and ''[[Amistad (1997 film)|Amistad]]''. Each of his films feature this shot utilized by the director, and the water scenes in ''Jaws'' are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In ''Empire of the Sun'', Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them.\n\nThe most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in ''Hook'' starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children. The absence of Elliott's father in ''E.T.'' is the most famous example of this theme. In ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son \"self reliance,\" which is not how Indy saw it). Even [[Oskar Schindler]], from ''[[Schindler's List]]'', is reluctant to have a child with his wife. In ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', the main character, Celie, has been impregnated by her father multiple times. ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'' depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are exceptions; Brody in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' is a committed family man, while John Anderton in ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, including ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure.

He stated, \"I grew up with this idea, [that] if you got to Spielberg, that's where it is \u2013 I'm not talking about fame, and I'm not talking about money. You get there, and you realize you're not meeting the Spielberg you dream of. You're meeting a different Spielberg, who is in a different stage in his career. He's less a director than he is a fucking company.\" He went on to discuss his on-set actor/director relationship with Spielberg, as well as the films they made together, \"Spielberg's sets are very different \u2013 everything has been so meticulously planned. You got to get this line out in 37 seconds. You do that for five years, you start to feel like not knowing what you're doing for a living.\" He concluded his point by stating: \"I don't like the movies that I made with Spielberg. The only movie that I liked that we made together was [the first] ''Transformers'' [film].\" Later in the interview, LaBeouf recited and criticised the advice given to him by Spielberg following the mixed reaction to both ''Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', and LaBeouf's performance in the film. He claims Spielberg told him not to read about himself in the media, but LaBeouf felt irritated by what he perceived to be non-advice and a lack of understanding, saying \"There's no way to not do that. For me to not read that means I need to not take part in society. The generation previous to mine didn't have the immediate response [of the internet].

The episode is unusual in his body of work, in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later, more \"mature\" films. After this, and an episode of ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'', Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]'' called \"[[L.A. 2017]]\". This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract. He did another segment on ''Night Gallery'' and did some work for shows such as ''[[Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law]]'' and ''The Psychiatrist'', before landing the first series episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' (previous episodes were actually TV films).\n\nBased on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films. The first was a [[Richard Matheson]] adaptation called ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]''. The film is about a psychotic [[Peterbilt 281]] [[tanker truck]] driver who chases the terrified driver ([[Dennis Weaver]]) of a small [[Plymouth Valiant]] and tries to run him off the road. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic [[Dilys Powell]] was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (''[[Something Evil]]'') was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called ''Savage'', starring [[Martin Landau]]. Spielberg's debut full-length feature film was ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that \"a major new director is on the horizon.\"<ref name=McBride />{{rp|223}} However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.\n\nStudio producers [[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] offered Spielberg the director's chair for ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', a thriller-horror film based on the [[Peter Benchley]] novel [[Jaws (novel)|about an enormous killer shark]]. Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible. Despite the film's ultimate, enormous success, it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs. But Spielberg persevered and finished the film. It was an enormous hit, winning three Academy Awards (for editing, original score and sound) and grossing more than $470&nbsp;million worldwide at the box office. It also set the domestic record for box office gross, leading to what the press described as \"Jawsmania.\"<ref name=McBride />{{rp|248}} ''Jaws'' made Spielberg a household name and one of America's youngest multi-millionaires, allowing him a great deal of autonomy for his future projects.<ref name=McBride />{{rp|250}} It was nominated for Best Picture and featured Spielberg's first of three collaborations with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]].\n\nRejecting offers to direct ''[[Jaws 2]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=John|year=1997|title=Steven Spielberg: The Unauthorised Biography|location=London|publisher=Harper Collins|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780006384441/page/145 145]|isbn=978-0-00-638444-1|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780006384441/page/145}}</ref> ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]], which became ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, ''Close Encounters'' was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other [[Academy Awards]] nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', a big-budgeted World War&nbsp;II farce, was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4&nbsp;million worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics.<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1979/01941.php \"1941, Box Office Information.\"] ''The Numbers'', September 27, 2012.</ref>\n\nSpielberg then revisited his ''Close Encounters'' project and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released ''Close Encounters: The Special Edition'' in 1980. For this, Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also, at the behest of Columbia, and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film, shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film (a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery). Nevertheless, the re-release was a moderate success, while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending.\n\n===1980s===\nNext, Spielberg teamed with ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator and friend [[George Lucas]] on an action adventure film, ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', the first of the [[Indiana Jones]] films. The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by [[Harrison Ford]] (whom Lucas had previously cast in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' films as [[Han Solo]]). The film was considered an homage to the cliffhanger serials of the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]]. It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture). ''Raiders'' is still considered a landmark example of the action-adventure genre. The film also led to Ford's casting in [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blade Runner|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/blade-runner/wikipedia/casting-and-characters/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820185400/https://www.gradesaver.com/blade-runner/wikipedia/casting-and-characters/|archivedate=August 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nA year later, Spielberg returned to the science fiction genre with ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. It was the story of a young boy and the alien he befriends, who was accidentally left behind by his companions and is attempting to return home. ''E.T.'' went on to become the top-grossing film of all time. It was also nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director, winning 4 of them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/et-spielberg-fantasy|title=ET: The Extra-Terrestrial: No 7 best sci-fi and fantasy film of all time|last=Wise|first=Damon|date=October 21, 2010|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 18, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\nBetween 1982 and 1985, Spielberg produced three high-grossing films: ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (for which he also co-wrote the screenplay), a big-screen adaptation of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie|The Twilight Zone]]'' (for which he directed the segment \"Kick The Can\"),<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1556111/story.jhtml|title= Rewind: Major-Studio flicks that belong in the Grind House|first = Karl|last = Heitmueller|date = April 3, 2007|accessdate =January 2, 2009|publisher = MTV|quote = Ultimate A-lister Steven Spielberg co-produced this big-budget adaptation of Rod Serling's classic '60s TV show....}}</ref> and ''[[The Goonies]]'' (Spielberg, executive producer, also wrote the story on which the screenplay was based).<ref>{{cite journal|title = This way to the children's crusade|first = Richard|last = Corliss|date = January 7, 1985|accessdate =January 2, 2009|quote = he wrote the story and served as an executive producer of The Goonies....|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959559,00.html|journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> Spielberg appeared in a cameo on [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s music video for the movie's theme song, \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\".<ref>{{youtube|LxLhytQ67fs|Cyndi Lauper \u2013 The Goonies 'R' Good Enough}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Steven Spielberg with Chandran Rutnam in Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Steven Spielberg and [[Chandran Rutnam]] on a location in Sri Lanka during the filming of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.]]\nHis next directorial feature was the ''Raiders'' prequel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''. Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford, the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script. This film and the Spielberg-produced ''[[Gremlins]]'' led to the creation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13 rating]] due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences. In spite of this, ''Temple of Doom'' is rated PG by the MPAA, even though it is the darkest and, possibly, most violent Indy film. Nonetheless, the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984. It was on this project that Spielberg also met his future wife, actress [[Kate Capshaw]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Steven-Spielberg-9490621|title=Steven Spielberg Biography|publisher=Biography.com|date=December 18, 1947|accessdate=January 31, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514201106/https://www.biography.com/articles/Steven-Spielberg-9490621|archivedate=May 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Spielberg released ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]],'' an adaptation of [[Alice Walker]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Color Purple|novel of the same name]], about a generation of empowered African-American women during depression-era America. Starring [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and future talk-show superstar [[Oprah Winfrey]], the film was a box office smash and critics hailed Spielberg's successful foray into the dramatic genre. [[Roger Ebert]] proclaimed it the best film of the year and later entered it into his Great Films archive. The film received eleven [[Academy Award]] nominations, including two for Goldberg and Winfrey. However, Spielberg did not get a Best Director nomination.\n\nIn 1987, as China began opening to Western capital investment, Spielberg shot the first American film in Shanghai since the 1930s, an adaptation of [[J. G. Ballard]]'s autobiographical novel ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', starring [[John Malkovich]] and a young [[Christian Bale]]. The film garnered much praise from critics and was nominated for several Oscars, but did not yield substantial box office revenues.

Once again teaming up with Lucas and Ford, Spielberg also cast actor [[Sean Connery]] in a supporting role as Indy's father. The film earned generally positive reviews and was another box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film worldwide that year; its total box office receipts even topped those of Tim Burton's much-anticipated film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', which had been the bigger hit domestically. Also in 1989, he re-united with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] for the romantic comedy-drama ''[[Always (1989 film)|Always]]'', about a daredevil pilot who extinguishes forest fires. Spielberg's first romantic film, ''Always'' was only a moderate success and had mixed reviews.\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:Steven Spielberg in 1990.jpg|thumb|left|Spielberg in March 1990]]\nIn 1991, Spielberg directed ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', about a middle-aged [[Peter Pan]], played by [[Robin Williams]], who returns to [[Neverland]]. Despite innumerable rewrites and creative changes coupled with mixed reviews, the film proved popular with audiences, making over $300&nbsp;million worldwide (from a $70&nbsp;million budget).\n\nIn 1993, Spielberg returned to the adventure genre with the film version of [[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', about a theme park with genetically engineered dinosaurs. With revolutionary special effects provided by friend [[George Lucas]]'s [[Industrial Light & Magic]] company, the film would eventually become the highest-grossing film of all time (at the worldwide box office) with $914.7&nbsp;million. This would be the third time that one of Spielberg's films became the highest-grossing film ever.\n\nSpielberg's next film, ''[[Schindler's List]]'', was based on the true story of [[Oskar Schindler]], a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust.<ref>The screenplay, adapted from [[Thomas Keneally]]'s novel, was originally in the hands of fellow director [[Martin Scorsese]], but Spielberg negotiated with Scorsese to trade scripts.

With the film a huge success at the box office, Spielberg used the profits to set up the [[Shoah Foundation]], a non-profit organization that archives filmed testimony of Holocaust survivors. In 1997, the [[American Film Institute]] listed it among the 10 Greatest American Films ever Made (#9) which moved up to (#8) when the list was remade in 2007.\n\nIn 1994, Spielberg took a hiatus from directing to spend more time with his family and build his new studio, [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]],<ref>{{cite magazine|author = Army Archered|title = Spielberg to take break after completing 'List'|magazine = Variety|date = June 17, 1993|url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862199.html?categoryid=2&cs=1&query=dark+AND+angel|accessdate = February 11, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011203554/http://variety.com/article/VR1117862199.html?categoryid=2&cs=1&query=dark+AND+angel|archive-date = October 11, 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref> with partners [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] and [[David Geffen]]. In 1996, he directed the sequel to 1993's ''Jurassic Park'' with ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', which generated over $618&nbsp;million worldwide despite mixed reviews, and was the second biggest film of 1997 behind [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (which topped the original ''Jurassic Park'' to become the new recordholder for box office receipts).\n[[File:Steven Spielberg - GianAngelo Pistoia 1.jpg|thumb|right|Spielberg receiving the [[Golden Lion]] by Italian filmmaker [[Gillo Pontecorvo]] at the [[50th Venice International Film Festival]], 1993]]\n\nHis next film, ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', was based on a true story (like ''Schindler's List''), specifically about an African slave rebellion.

Miller ([[Tom Hanks]]) sent to bring home a [[paratrooper]] whose three older brothers were killed in the same twenty-four hours, June 5\u20136, of the Normandy landing. The film was a huge box office success, grossing over $481&nbsp;million worldwide and was the biggest film of the year at the North American box office (worldwide it made second place after Michael Bay's ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''). Spielberg won his second Academy Award for his direction. The film's graphic, realistic depiction of combat violence influenced later war films such as ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' and ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]''. The film was also the first major hit for DreamWorks, which co-produced the film with [[Paramount Pictures]] (as such, it was Spielberg's first release from the latter that was not part of the ''Indiana Jones'' series). Later, Spielberg and [[Tom Hanks]] produced a [[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|TV mini-series]] based on [[Stephen Ambrose]]'s book ''[[Band of Brothers (book)|Band of Brothers]]''. The ten-part [[HBO]] mini-series follows Easy Company of the [[101st Airborne Division]]'s 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The series won a number of awards at the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]].\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2001, Spielberg filmed fellow director and friend [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s final project, ''[[A.I.

A futuristic film about a humanoid [[android (robot)|android]] longing for love, ''A.I.'' featured groundbreaking visual effects and a multi-layered, allegorical storyline, adapted by Spielberg himself. Though the film's reception in the US was relatively muted, it performed better overseas for a worldwide total box office gross of $236&nbsp;million.\n\nSpielberg and actor [[Tom Cruise]] collaborated for the first time for the futuristic [[neo-noir]] ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', based upon [[The Minority Report|the science fiction short story]] written by [[Philip K.

It starred Tom Cruise and [[Dakota Fanning]], and, as with past Spielberg films, [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) provided the [[visual effects]]. Unlike ''E.T.'' and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', which depicted friendly alien visitors, ''War of the Worlds'' featured violent invaders. The film was another huge box office smash, grossing over $591&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\nSpielberg's film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', about the events following the 1972 [[Munich Massacre]] of Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games, was his second film essaying Jewish relations in the world (the first being ''Schindler's List'').

Most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. <!-- This is especially evident in the [[Indiana Jones]] series. : Archaeologist, adventurer and relic hunter is not really an \"ordinary character\"-->In an [[American Film Institute|AFI]] interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films. Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood,<ref name=\"McBride\">{{cite book| last = McBride| first = Joseph| title = Steven Spielberg| publisher = Faber and Faber|year=1997| isbn = 978-0-571-19177-2}}</ref> and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge.<ref>{{cite book| title = E.T. DVD Production Notes Booklet| publisher = Universal|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nA strong consistent [[theme (literature)|theme]] in his family-friendly work is a childlike sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' and ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]''. According to Warren Buckland,<ref>Directed by Steven Spielberg: Poetics of the Contemporary Hollywood Blockbuster</ref> these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'', ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', ''[[The Terminal]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', and ''[[Amistad (1997 film)|Amistad]]''. Each of his films feature this shot utilized by the director, and the water scenes in ''Jaws'' are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In ''Empire of the Sun'', Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them.\n\nThe most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in ''Hook'' starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children. The absence of Elliott's father in ''E.T.'' is the most famous example of this theme. In ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son \"self reliance,\" which is not how Indy saw it). Even [[Oskar Schindler]], from ''[[Schindler's List]]'', is reluctant to have a child with his wife. In ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', the main character, Celie, has been impregnated by her father multiple times. ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'' depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are exceptions; Brody in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' is a committed family man, while John Anderton in ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, including ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders.\n\nMost of his films are generally optimistic in nature. Though some critics accuse his films of being a little overly sentimental, Spielberg feels it is fine as long as it is disguised.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} He is still a highly praised director as well as being credited as one of the most influential directors of all time. The influence comes from directors [[Frank Capra]] and [[John Ford]].<ref name=\"culture show\">{{cite video| title = The Culture Show| medium = TV|publisher=BBC|date = November 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Marriages and children ===\nSpielberg met actress [[Amy Irving]] in 1976 at the suggestion of director [[Brian De Palma]], who knew he was looking for an actress to play in ''Close Encounters''. After meeting her, Spielberg told his co-producer [[Julia Phillips]], \"I met a real heartbreaker last night.\"<ref name=McBride />{{rp|293}} Although she was too young for the role, she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved into what she described as his \"bachelor funky\" house.<ref name=McBride />{{rp|294}} They lived together for four years, but the stresses of their professional careers took a toll on their relationship. Irving wanted to be certain that whatever success she attained as an actress would be her own: \"I don't want to be known as Steven's girlfriend,\" she said, and chose not to be in any of his films during those years.<ref name=McBride />{{rp|295}} As a result, they broke up in 1979, but remained close friends. Then in 1984 they renewed their romance, and in November 1985 they married, after the birth of their son, Max Samuel. But after 3 1/2 years of marriage, many of the same competing stresses of their careers caused them to divorce in 1989. They agreed to maintain homes near each other to facilitate the shared custody and parenting of their son.<ref name=McBride />{{rp|403}} Their divorce was recorded as the third most costly celebrity divorce in history.<ref>{{cite news|title = 'Most costly' celebrity divorces|work=BBC News|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6552597.stm|date = April 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\nSpielberg subsequently developed a relationship with actress [[Kate Capshaw]], whom he met when he cast her in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.

In it, he discussed Spielberg's strengths as a filmmaker, saying \"there is a welcome complexity of tone and approach in these later films that defies the lazy stereotypes often bandied about his films\" and that \"Spielberg continues to take risks, with his body of work continuing to grow more impressive and ambitious\", concluding that he has only received \"limited, begrudging recognition\" from critics.<ref name=\"Rowley\" />\n*[[Shia LaBeouf]], who worked with Spielberg on a number of films including ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' and various [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] productions (such as the [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' film series]]), described his experiences working with the director in a wide-ranging interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in 2016. He stated, \"I grew up with this idea, [that] if you got to Spielberg, that's where it is \u2013 I'm not talking about fame, and I'm not talking about money. You get there, and you realize you're not meeting the Spielberg you dream of. You're meeting a different Spielberg, who is in a different stage in his career. He's less a director than he is a fucking company.\" He went on to discuss his on-set actor/director relationship with Spielberg, as well as the films they made together, \"Spielberg's sets are very different \u2013 everything has been so meticulously planned. You got to get this line out in 37 seconds. You do that for five years, you start to feel like not knowing what you're doing for a living.\" He concluded his point by stating: \"I don't like the movies that I made with Spielberg. The only movie that I liked that we made together was [the first] ''Transformers'' [film].\" Later in the interview, LaBeouf recited and criticised the advice given to him by Spielberg following the mixed reaction to both ''Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', and LaBeouf's performance in the film. He claims Spielberg told him not to read about himself in the media, but LaBeouf felt irritated by what he perceived to be non-advice and a lack of understanding, saying \"There's no way to not do that. For me to not read that means I need to not take part in society. The generation previous to mine didn't have the immediate response [of the internet].
