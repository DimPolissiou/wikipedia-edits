However, some employees' unions conducted their negotiations within mutually agreed limits above this limit with employers.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/28/newsid_2531000/2531007.stm  On This Day: 1979: Early election as Callaghan defeated], [[BBC]]. Retrieved 17 December 2007.</ref> While the strikes were largely over by February 1979, the government's inability to contain the strikes earlier helped lead to [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] victory in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and legislation to restrict unions. Public sector employee strike actions included an unofficial strike by [[gravedigger]]s working in [[Liverpool]] and [[Tameside]], and strikes by refuse collectors. Additionally, [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] ancillary workers formed picket lines to blockade hospital entrances with the result that many hospitals were reduced to taking emergency patients only.<ref name=bbc/>\n\nThe phrase \"Winter of Discontent\" is from the opening line of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'': \"Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer by this sun [or son] of [[House of York|York]]\", and was first applied to the events of the winter by Robin Chater{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}, a writer at ''Incomes Data Report''.

Labour had entered government in 1974 under these conditions as a minority government in the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 election]], then winning a slim majority of three seats in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 election]]. Callaghan warned his fellow Cabinet members in 1974 of the possibility of \"a breakdown of democracy\", telling them that \"If I were a young man, I would emigrate.\"<ref name=\"beckett2010\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NURERF4hb8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA175#v=onepage&f=false | title=When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies | publisher=Faber & Faber | author=Beckett, Andy | year=2010 | pages=175 | isbn=978-0-571-22137-0}}</ref> \n\nThe Labour governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and his successor (from 1976) Callaghan continued a fight against inflation upon election, which peaked at 26.9% in the 12 months to August 1975. While demonstrating to markets [[fiscal responsibility]] the government wished to avoid large increases in unemployment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Colin Hay |title=Chronicles of a Death Foretold: the Winter of Discontent and Construction of the Crisis of British Keynesianism |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |year=2010 |volume=63 |pages=446\u201370 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsp056 |issue=3}}</ref> As part of the campaign to bring down inflation, the government had agreed a \"[[Social Contract (Britain)|social contract]]\" with the [[Trades Union Congress]] which allowed for a voluntary [[incomes policy]] in which the pay rises for workers were held down to limits set by the government. Previous governments had brought in incomes policies backed by [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], but the social contract agreed that this would not happen.<ref name=bbc/> \n\n===Phases I and II===\nPhase I of the pay policy was announced on 11 July 1975 with a [[white paper]] entitled ''The Attack on Inflation''. This proposed a limit on wage rises of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]6 per week for all earning below \u00a38,500 annually.  The [[TUC General Council]] had accepted these proposals by 19 votes to 13. On 5 May 1976 the TUC accepted a new policy for 1976 increases, beginning 1 August, of between \u00a32.50 and \u00a34 per week with further years outlined.  At the Annual Congress on 8 September 1976 the TUC rejected a motion which called for a return to free [[collective bargaining]] (which meant no incomes policy at all) once Phase I expired on 1 August 1977. This new policy was Phase II of the incomes policy.<ref name=hay> Hay, \"The winter of discontent thirty years on.\"</ref>\n\n===Phase III===\nOn 15 July 1977, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]] announced Phase III of the incomes policy in which there was to be a phased return to free collective bargaining, without \"a free-for-all\".  After prolonged negotiations, the TUC agreed to continue with the modest increases recommended for 1977\u201378 under Phase II limits and not to try to reopen pay agreements made under the previous policy, while the Government agreed not to intervene in pay negotiations. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] criticised the power of the unions and lack of any stronger policy to cover the period from the summer of 1978. The inflation rate continued to fall through 1977 and by 1978 the annual rate fell below 10%.<ref name=hay/>\n\n===Five percent limit===\nHaving prepared for the imminent end of the [[incomes policy]], global inflation supervened and was coming towards [[Interest rate#Historical interest rates|record levels during the 1978\u201382 period]].{{refn|And therefore a second trigger for a rise in [[inflation]]|group= n}} On 21 July 1978 [[Denis Healey]] introduced a new White Paper which set a guideline for pay rises of 5% in the year from 1 August. Callaghan was determined to keep inflation down to single figures, however trade union leaders warned the government that the 5% limit was unachivable, and urged a more flexible approach with a range of settlements between 5 and 8%. [[Terry Duffy]] president of the [[Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers]] described the limit as 'political suicide'. Denis Healey also privately expressed scepticism about the achievability of the limit. The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to [[collective bargaining|free collective bargaining]] as they were promised.<ref name=\"Conroy\">{{cite book |last1=Conroy |first1=Harry |title=Callaghan |date=2006 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=1-904950-70-1 |pages=109-124}}</ref><ref name=hay/> \n\nIt had been widely expected that Callaghan would call a general election in the Autumn of 1978, and that the 5% limit would be revised if Labour won. Unexpectedly however on 7 September, Callaghan announced that he would not be calling a general election that autumn but seeking to go through the winter with continued pay restraint so that the economy would be in a better state in preparation for a spring election, therefore the 5% limit stood. The pay limit was officially termed \"Phase IV\" but most referred to it as \"the 5% limit\".  Although the government did not make the 5% limit a legal requirement, it decided to impose penalties on private and public government contractors who broke the limit.<ref name=hay/><ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=A.J. |title=To Build a New Jerusalem |date=1996 |isbn=0-349-10809-9 |pages=363-368}}</ref>\n.\n\n==Ford negotiations==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Fordstrikers.jpg|right|thumb|Striking Ford workers demonstrate outside the negotiations over the company's pay offer in November 1978]] -->\nAlthough not an official guideline, the pay rise set by [[Ford of Britain]] was accepted throughout private industry as a benchmark for negotiations.  Ford had enjoyed a good year, and could afford to offer a large pay rise to its workers.  The company was, however, also a major government contractor.  Ford's management therefore made a pay offer within the 5% guidelines. In response, 15,000 Ford workers, mostly from the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] (TGWU), began an unofficial strike on 22 September 1978, which subsequently became an official TGWU action on 5 October.  The number of participants grew to 57,000.\n\nDuring the strike, [[Vauxhall Motors]] employees accepted an 8.5% rise.  After long negotiation in which they weighed the chances of suffering from government sanctions against the continued damage of the strike, Ford eventually revised their offer to 17% and decided to accept the sanctions; Ford workers accepted the rise on 22 November.\n\n==Political difficulties==\nAs the Ford strike was starting, the Labour Party conference began at [[Blackpool]]. Terry Duffy, the delegate from [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]] Constituency Labour Party and a supporter of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group, moved a motion on 2 October which demanded \"that the Government immediately cease intervening in wage negotiations\". Despite a plea from [[Michael Foot]] not to put the motion to the vote, the resolution was carried by 4,017,000 to 1,924,000. The next day, the Prime Minister accepted the fact of defeat by saying \"I think it was a lesson in democracy yesterday\", but insisted that he would not let up on the fight against inflation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Labour Party|title=Report of the Annual Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjCNAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Labour Representation Committee|page=235}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the government's situation in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was increasingly difficult; through by-elections it had lost its majority of three seats in 1976 and had been forced to put together a [[Lab-Lib pact#1977|pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1977 in order to keep winning votes on legislation; the pact lapsed in July 1978.  A decision to grant extra parliamentary seats to [[Northern Ireland]] afforded temporary support from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], but the Unionists were clear that this support would be withdrawn immediately after the Bill to grant extra seats had been passed &ndash; it was through the Ulster Unionists agreeing to abstain that the government defeated a [[motion of no confidence]] by 312 to 300 on 9 November.<ref name=hay/>\n\n===Further negotiation at the TUC===\nBy the middle of November it was clear that Ford would offer an increase substantially over the 5% limit. The government subsequently entered into intense negotiations with the TUC, hoping to produce an agreement on pay policy that would prevent disputes and show political unity in the run-up to the general election. A limited and weak formula was eventually worked out and put to the General Council of the TUC on 14 November, but its General Council vote was tied 14\u201314, with the formula being rejected on the chair's casting vote. One important personality on the TUC General Council had changed earlier in 1978 with [[Moss Evans]] replacing [[Jack Jones (trade union leader)|Jack Jones]] at the TGWU. Evans proved a weak leader of his union, although it is doubtful whether Jones could have restrained the actions of some of the TGWU shop stewards.\n\nAfter Ford settled, the government announced on 28 November that sanctions{{clarify|date=August 2013}} would be imposed on Ford, along with 220 other companies, for breach of the pay policy. The announcement of actual sanctions produced an immediate protest from the [[Confederation of British Industry]] which announced that it would challenge their legality. The Conservatives put down a motion in the House of Commons to revoke the sanctions. A co-ordinated protest by left-wing Labour MPs over spending on defence forced the debate set for 7 December to be postponed; however on 13 December an anti-sanctions amendment was passed by 285 to 279. The substantive motion as amended was then passed by 285 to 283. James Callaghan put down a further motion of confidence for the next day, which the government won by ten votes (300 to 290), but accepted that his government could not use sanctions. In effect this deprived the government of any means of enforcing the 5% limit on private industry.\n\n==Lorry drivers==\nWith the government having no way of enforcing its pay policy, unions which had not yet put in pay claims began to increase their aim. The first to take  action were [[truck|lorry]] drivers, members of the TGWU. Large numbers of the lorry drivers worked on oil tankers, and drivers working for [[BP]] and [[Esso]] began an overtime ban in support of rises of up to 40% on 18 December. With supplies of oil being disrupted, the [[Cabinet Office]] prepared \"Operation Drumstick\", by which the [[British Army|Army]] were put on standby to take over from the tanker drivers. However, the operation would need the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] in order to allow conscription of the assets of the oil companies, and the government drew back from such a step. Before the situation developed into a crisis the oil companies settled on wage rises of around 15 per cent.\n\nFrom 3 January 1979 an unofficial strike of all TGWU lorry drivers began. With petrol distribution held up, petrol stations closed across the country. The strikers also [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] the main ports. The strikes were made official on 11 January by the TGWU and 12 January by the United Road Transport Union. With 80% of the nation's goods transported by road, essential supplies were put in danger as striking drivers picketed those firms that continued to work. While the oil tanker drivers were working, the main refineries were also targeted and the tanker drivers let the strikers know where they were going, allowing for flying pickets to turn them back at their destination. More than a million UK workers were laid off temporarily during the disputes.\n\nA further plan was drawn up to call a state of emergency and safeguard essential supplies through the Army, regarding which the government warned the TGWU leadership, which resulted in the union accepting (12 January 1979) a list of emergency supplies which were officially exempt from action. In practice, what counted as an emergency was left up to local officials of the TGWU to determine, and practice across the country varied according to the views of the local shop stewards who established \"dispensation committees\" to decide. When strikers in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] did not allow the correct mix of animal feed through to local farms, the farmers dropped the bodies of dead piglets and chickens outside the union offices; the union contended that the farmers had actually wrung the chicken's necks to kill them, and the piglets had been killed when the sow rolled over and crushed them.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 29 January, lorry drivers in the South West accepted a deal awarded by an [[arbitration|arbitration panel]] of a rise of up to 20 per cent, just \u00a31 per week less than the union had been striking for; this settlement proved a model which was accepted throughout the country.\n\n==\"Crisis? What crisis?\"==\nOn 10 January, [[James Callaghan]] arrived back from a [[Guadeloupe Conference|summit in Guadeloupe]] in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. Having been tipped off that the press were present, his press secretary Tom McCaffrey advised him to say nothing and return immediately to work, but his political adviser [[Thomas McNally, Baron McNally|Tom McNally]] thought that the image of Callaghan returning and declaring his intent to take control of the situation would be reassuring. Callaghan therefore decided to give a press conference at [[Heathrow Airport]]. To McNally's dismay Callaghan was jocular and referred to having had a swim in the Caribbean during the summit. He was then asked (by a reporter from the ''[[Evening Standard]]'') \"What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?\" and replied:\n\n{{Quote|Well, that's a judgment that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.}}\n\nThe next day's edition of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' featured the famous headline \"Crisis? What crisis?\" with a subheading \"Rail, lorry, jobs chaos \u2013 and Jim blames Press\", condemning Callaghan as being \"out of touch\" with British society.<ref name=bbc>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml BBC News \u2013 History of the Winter of Discontent]</ref>\n\n==Public sector employees==\n22 January 1979 was the biggest individual day of strike action since the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] of 1926, and many workers stayed out indefinitely afterwards.  With many in the private sector having achieved substantial rises, the public sector unions became increasingly concerned to keep pace in terms of pay. The government had already announced a slight weakening of the policy on 16 January, which gave the unions cause for hope that they might win and use free collective bargaining. Train drivers belonging to [[ASLEF]] and the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] had already begun a series of 24-hour strikes, and the [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference on 18 January decided to ask that the pay of nurses be increased to the same level in real terms as 1974, which would mean a 25 per cent average rise.  The public sector unions labelled the date the \"Day of Action\", in which they held a 24-hour strike and marched to demand a \u00a360 per week minimum wage.\n\nWith the succession of strikes having been called and then won, many groups of workers began to take unofficial action \u2013 often without the consent or support of the union leaderships. Ambulance drivers began to take strike action in mid-January, and in parts of the country (London, West Midlands, [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]] and the west of Scotland) their action included refusing to attend 999 emergency calls. In these areas, the Army was drafted in to provide a skeleton service. Ancillary hospital staff also went on strike.<ref name=bbc/> On 30 January, the [[Secretary of State for Social Services]] [[David Ennals]] announced that 1,100 of 2,300 [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals were only treating emergencies, that practically no ambulance service was operating normally, and that the ancillary health service workers were deciding which cases merited treatment. The media reported with scorn that [[cancer]] patients were being prevented from getting essential treatment.\n\n===Gravediggers' strike===\nA notorious industrial action during the winter, and one which was later frequently referred to by Conservative politicians, was the strike by gravediggers, members of the [[GMWU]] in [[Liverpool]] and in [[Tameside]] near [[Manchester]].<ref>Moore (2014), p. 399.</ref> Eighty gravediggers being on strike, [[Liverpool City Council]] hired a factory in [[Speke]] to store the corpses until they could be buried. The Department of Environment noted that there were 150 bodies stored at the factory at one point, with 25 more added every day. The reports of unburied bodies caused concern with the public.<ref name=\"Travis\">{{cite news|last=Travis|first=Alan|title=National archives: Fear of fights at cemetery gates during 1979 winter of discontent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/liverpool-gravedigger-strikes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 December 2009}}</ref> On 1 February a persistent journalist asked the Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, Dr Duncan Bolton, what would be done if the strike continued for months, Bolton speculated that [[burial at sea]] would be considered. Although his response was hypothetical, in the circumstances it caused great alarm. Other alternatives were considered, including allowing the bereaved to dig their own funeral's graves, deploying troops, and engaging private contractors to inter the bodies.  The main concerns were said to be aesthetic because bodies could be safely stored in heat-sealed bags for up to six weeks.<ref name=\"Travis\"/> Bolton later reported being \"horrified\" by the sensationalised reportage of the strike in the mass media.<ref>James Thomas, '\"Bound by History\": The Winter of Discontent in British Politics 1979\u20132004', ''Media, Culture and Society'', 29 (2007), p. 270.</ref> The gravediggers eventually settled for a 14% rise after a fortnight's strike.\n\n===Waste collectors===\nWith many collectors having been on strike since 22 January, local authorities began to run out of space for storing waste and used local parks under their control. The Conservative controlled [[Westminster City Council]] used [[Leicester Square]] in the heart of London's West End for piles of rubbish and, as the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' reported, this attracted [[rat]]s.\n\nOn 21 February, a settlement of the local authority workers' dispute was agreed, whereby workers got an 11% rise, plus \u00a31 per week, with the possibility of extra rises, should a pay comparability study recommend them. Some left-wing local authorities, among them the [[London Borough of Camden]], conceded the union demands in full (known as the \"Camden surplus\") and then saw an investigation by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|District Auditor]], which eventually ruled it a breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]]{{refn|Owed to the payers, the ratepayers of the area|group= n}} and therefore illegal. Camden Borough councillors, among them [[Ken Livingstone]], avoided [[Surcharge (sanction on public servant)|surcharge]]. Livingstone was Leader of the [[Greater London Council]] at the time the decision not to impose a surcharge was made.\n\n==End of the strikes==\nStrikes by essential services dismayed many senior ministers in the Labour government who had been close to the trade union movement, who had thought it unlikely that trade unionists would take such action. Among these was Prime Minister James Callaghan himself, who had built his political career on his connection to the trade unions, and had practically founded one, the [[Inland Revenue Staff Federation]]. Callaghan called the actions of the strikers \"free collective vandalism\".<ref>{{cite web |title=CALLAGHAN DEPICTS STRIKERS AS VANDALS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/callaghan-depicts-strikers-as-vandals-britons-woes-mount-as-workers.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=30 November 2019 |date=2 February 1979}}</ref><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe government was negotiating with the senior union leaders and on 11 February came to agreement on a proposal to be put to the TUC General Council. On 14 February the General Council agreed the concordat, published under the title \"The Economy, the Government, and Trade Union Responsibilities\".{{refn|The significance of a comprehensive agreement on [[Valentine's Day]] was remarked upon by the press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}|group= n}} By this stage union executives had limited control over their members and strikes did not immediately cease, although they began to wind down from this point. In total in 1979, 29,474,000 working days were lost in industrial disputes, compared with 9,306,000 in 1978.\n\n==Political fallout==\nIn the summer before the Winter of Discontent, the minority Labour government's fortunes in the opinion polls had been improving and suggested that they could gain an overall majority in the event of a general election being held. However, on 7 September 1978, Callaghan announced that no general election would be held that year. Callaghan's failure to call an election would ultimately prove to be a costly mistake for his government.<ref name=calruns>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm |work=BBC News | title=1978: Callaghan accused of running scared | date=7 September 1978}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thatcher-loc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]], who won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and became Prime Minister]]\nThe strikes appeared to have a profound effect on voting intention. According to [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], Labour had a lead of 5 percentage points over the Conservatives in November 1978, which turned to a Conservative lead of 7.5 percentage points in January 1979, and of 20 percentage points in February. On 1 March, referendums on [[devolution]] to Scotland and Wales were held. That in Wales went strongly against devolution; that in Scotland produced a small majority in favour which did not reach the threshold set by Parliament of 40% of the electorate. The government's decision not to press ahead with devolution immediately led the [[Scottish National Party]] to withdraw support from the government and on 28 March in a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|motion of no confidence the government lost by one vote]], precipitating a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]].\n\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] had already outlined her proposals for restricting trade union power in a [[party political broadcast]] on 17 January in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. During the election campaign the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] made extensive use of the disruption caused during the strike. One broadcast on 23 April began with the Sun's headline \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" being shown and read out by an increasingly desperate voiceover interspersed with film footage of piles of rubbish, closed factories, picketed hospitals and locked graveyards. The scale of the Conservatives' victory in the general election has often been ascribed to the effect of the strikes, as well as their \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign, and the party used film of the events of the winter in election campaigns for years to come.\n\nFollowing Thatcher's election win, she brought the [[post-war consensus]] to a halt and made drastic changes to trade union laws (most notably the regulation that unions had to hold a ballot among members before calling strikes) and as a result strikes were at their lowest level for 30 years by the time of the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], which the Conservatives won by a landslide.<ref name=\"83electionyoutube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7noHkLaZ5VI|title=Conservative Party Election Broadcast (1983)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Organized labour|United Kingdom}}\n\n* [[Three-Day Week]]{{refn|The Three-Day Week was the [[Heath government]]'s reaction to the [[coal mining|coal miner]]s' [[work-to-rule]] and strikes in 1974, that had a similarly disastrous impact on the government's popularity and led to the period of [[Labour government, 1974\u20131979|Labour government]] in the intervening years [[1979 United Kingdom general election|until 1979]].|group=n}}\n* [[Labour Isn't Working]]\n* [[Strike wave of 1945\u201346]], in U.S., followed by election of conservative Republican majorities in Congress who also passed laws restricting union activities\n* [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Beckett, Andy.

Public sector employee strike actions included an unofficial strike by [[gravedigger]]s working in [[Liverpool]] and [[Tameside]], and strikes by refuse collectors.

Labour had entered government in 1974 under these conditions as a minority government in the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 election]], then winning a slim majority of three seats in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 election]]. Callaghan warned his fellow Cabinet members in 1974 of the possibility of \"a breakdown of democracy\", telling them that \"If I were a young man, I would emigrate.\"<ref name=\"beckett2010\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NURERF4hb8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA175#v=onepage&f=false | title=When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies | publisher=Faber & Faber | author=Beckett, Andy | year=2010 | pages=175 | isbn=978-0-571-22137-0}}</ref> \n\nThe Labour governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and his successor (from 1976) Callaghan continued a fight against inflation upon election, which peaked at 26.9% in the 12 months to August 1975. While demonstrating to markets [[fiscal responsibility]] the government wished to avoid large increases in unemployment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Colin Hay |title=Chronicles of a Death Foretold: the Winter of Discontent and Construction of the Crisis of British Keynesianism |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |year=2010 |volume=63 |pages=446\u201370 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsp056 |issue=3}}</ref> As part of the campaign to bring down inflation, the government had agreed a \"[[Social Contract (Britain)|social contract]]\" with the [[Trades Union Congress]] which allowed for a voluntary [[incomes policy]] in which the pay rises for workers were held down to limits set by the government. Previous governments had brought in incomes policies backed by [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], but the social contract agreed that this would not happen.<ref name=bbc/> \n\n===Phases I and II===\nPhase I of the pay policy was announced on 11 July 1975 with a [[white paper]] entitled ''The Attack on Inflation''. This proposed a limit on wage rises of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]6 per week for all earning below \u00a38,500 annually.  The [[TUC General Council]] had accepted these proposals by 19 votes to 13. On 5 May 1976 the TUC accepted a new policy for 1976 increases, beginning 1 August, of between \u00a32.50 and \u00a34 per week with further years outlined.  At the Annual Congress on 8 September 1976 the TUC rejected a motion which called for a return to free [[collective bargaining]] (which meant no incomes policy at all) once Phase I expired on 1 August 1977. This new policy was Phase II of the incomes policy.<ref name=hay> Hay, \"The winter of discontent thirty years on.\"</ref>\n\n===Phase III===\nOn 15 July 1977, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]] announced Phase III of the incomes policy in which there was to be a phased return to free collective bargaining, without \"a free-for-all\".  After prolonged negotiations, the TUC agreed to continue with the modest increases recommended for 1977\u201378 under Phase II limits and not to try to reopen pay agreements made under the previous policy, while the Government agreed not to intervene in pay negotiations. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] criticised the power of the unions and lack of any stronger policy to cover the period from the summer of 1978. The inflation rate continued to fall through 1977 and by 1978 the annual rate fell below 10%.<ref name=hay/>\n\n===Five percent limit===\nHaving prepared for the imminent end of the [[incomes policy]], global inflation supervened and was coming towards [[Interest rate#Historical interest rates|record levels during the 1978\u201382 period]].{{refn|And therefore a second trigger for a rise in [[inflation]]|group= n}} On 21 July 1978 [[Denis Healey]] introduced a new White Paper which set a guideline for pay rises of 5% in the year from 1 August. Callaghan was determined to keep inflation down to single figures, however trade union leaders warned the government that the 5% limit was unachivable, and urged a more flexible approach with a range of settlements between 5 and 8%. [[Terry Duffy]] president of the [[Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers]] described the limit as 'political suicide'. Denis Healey also privately expressed scepticism about the achievability of the limit. The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to [[collective bargaining|free collective bargaining]] as they were promised.<ref name=\"Conroy\">{{cite book |last1=Conroy |first1=Harry |title=Callaghan |date=2006 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=1-904950-70-1 |pages=109-124}}</ref><ref name=hay/> \n\nIt had been widely expected that Callaghan would call a general election in the Autumn of 1978, and that the 5% limit would be revised if Labour won. Unexpectedly however on 7 September, Callaghan announced that he would not be calling a general election that autumn but seeking to go through the winter with continued pay restraint so that the economy would be in a better state in preparation for a spring election, therefore the 5% limit stood. The pay limit was officially termed \"Phase IV\" but most referred to it as \"the 5% limit\".  Although the government did not make the 5% limit a legal requirement, it decided to impose penalties on private and public government contractors who broke the limit.<ref name=hay/><ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=A.J. |title=To Build a New Jerusalem |date=1996 |isbn=0-349-10809-9 |pages=363-368}}</ref>\n.\n\n==Ford negotiations==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Fordstrikers.jpg|right|thumb|Striking Ford workers demonstrate outside the negotiations over the company's pay offer in November 1978]] -->\nAlthough not an official guideline, the pay rise set by [[Ford of Britain]] was accepted throughout private industry as a benchmark for negotiations.  Ford had enjoyed a good year, and could afford to offer a large pay rise to its workers.  The company was, however, also a major government contractor.  Ford's management therefore made a pay offer within the 5% guidelines. In response, 15,000 Ford workers, mostly from the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] (TGWU), began an unofficial strike on 22 September 1978, which subsequently became an official TGWU action on 5 October.  The number of participants grew to 57,000.\n\nDuring the strike, [[Vauxhall Motors]] employees accepted an 8.5% rise.  After long negotiation in which they weighed the chances of suffering from government sanctions against the continued damage of the strike, Ford eventually revised their offer to 17% and decided to accept the sanctions; Ford workers accepted the rise on 22 November.\n\n==Political difficulties==\nAs the Ford strike was starting, the Labour Party conference began at [[Blackpool]]. Terry Duffy, the delegate from [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]] Constituency Labour Party and a supporter of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group, moved a motion on 2 October which demanded \"that the Government immediately cease intervening in wage negotiations\". Despite a plea from [[Michael Foot]] not to put the motion to the vote, the resolution was carried by 4,017,000 to 1,924,000. The next day, the Prime Minister accepted the fact of defeat by saying \"I think it was a lesson in democracy yesterday\", but insisted that he would not let up on the fight against inflation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Labour Party|title=Report of the Annual Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjCNAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Labour Representation Committee|page=235}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the government's situation in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was increasingly difficult; through by-elections it had lost its majority of three seats in 1976 and had been forced to put together a [[Lab-Lib pact#1977|pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1977 in order to keep winning votes on legislation; the pact lapsed in July 1978.  A decision to grant extra parliamentary seats to [[Northern Ireland]] afforded temporary support from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], but the Unionists were clear that this support would be withdrawn immediately after the Bill to grant extra seats had been passed &ndash; it was through the Ulster Unionists agreeing to abstain that the government defeated a [[motion of no confidence]] by 312 to 300 on 9 November.<ref name=hay/>\n\n===Further negotiation at the TUC===\nBy the middle of November it was clear that Ford would offer an increase substantially over the 5% limit. The government subsequently entered into intense negotiations with the TUC, hoping to produce an agreement on pay policy that would prevent disputes and show political unity in the run-up to the general election. A limited and weak formula was eventually worked out and put to the General Council of the TUC on 14 November, but its General Council vote was tied 14\u201314, with the formula being rejected on the chair's casting vote. One important personality on the TUC General Council had changed earlier in 1978 with [[Moss Evans]] replacing [[Jack Jones (trade union leader)|Jack Jones]] at the TGWU. Evans proved a weak leader of his union, although it is doubtful whether Jones could have restrained the actions of some of the TGWU shop stewards.\n\nAfter Ford settled, the government announced on 28 November that sanctions{{clarify|date=August 2013}} would be imposed on Ford, along with 220 other companies, for breach of the pay policy. The announcement of actual sanctions produced an immediate protest from the [[Confederation of British Industry]] which announced that it would challenge their legality. The Conservatives put down a motion in the House of Commons to revoke the sanctions. A co-ordinated protest by left-wing Labour MPs over spending on defence forced the debate set for 7 December to be postponed; however on 13 December an anti-sanctions amendment was passed by 285 to 279. The substantive motion as amended was then passed by 285 to 283. James Callaghan put down a further motion of confidence for the next day, which the government won by ten votes (300 to 290), but accepted that his government could not use sanctions. In effect this deprived the government of any means of enforcing the 5% limit on private industry.\n\n==Lorry drivers==\nWith the government having no way of enforcing its pay policy, unions which had not yet put in pay claims began to increase their aim. The first to take  action were [[truck|lorry]] drivers, members of the TGWU. Large numbers of the lorry drivers worked on oil tankers, and drivers working for [[BP]] and [[Esso]] began an overtime ban in support of rises of up to 40% on 18 December. With supplies of oil being disrupted, the [[Cabinet Office]] prepared \"Operation Drumstick\", by which the [[British Army|Army]] were put on standby to take over from the tanker drivers. However, the operation would need the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] in order to allow conscription of the assets of the oil companies, and the government drew back from such a step. Before the situation developed into a crisis the oil companies settled on wage rises of around 15 per cent.\n\nFrom 3 January 1979 an unofficial strike of all TGWU lorry drivers began. With petrol distribution held up, petrol stations closed across the country. The strikers also [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] the main ports. The strikes were made official on 11 January by the TGWU and 12 January by the United Road Transport Union. With 80% of the nation's goods transported by road, essential supplies were put in danger as striking drivers picketed those firms that continued to work. While the oil tanker drivers were working, the main refineries were also targeted and the tanker drivers let the strikers know where they were going, allowing for flying pickets to turn them back at their destination. More than a million UK workers were laid off temporarily during the disputes.\n\nA further plan was drawn up to call a state of emergency and safeguard essential supplies through the Army, regarding which the government warned the TGWU leadership, which resulted in the union accepting (12 January 1979) a list of emergency supplies which were officially exempt from action. In practice, what counted as an emergency was left up to local officials of the TGWU to determine, and practice across the country varied according to the views of the local shop stewards who established \"dispensation committees\" to decide. When strikers in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] did not allow the correct mix of animal feed through to local farms, the farmers dropped the bodies of dead piglets and chickens outside the union offices; the union contended that the farmers had actually wrung the chicken's necks to kill them, and the piglets had been killed when the sow rolled over and crushed them.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 29 January, lorry drivers in the South West accepted a deal awarded by an [[arbitration|arbitration panel]] of a rise of up to 20 per cent, just \u00a31 per week less than the union had been striking for; this settlement proved a model which was accepted throughout the country.\n\n==\"Crisis? What crisis?\"==\nOn 10 January, [[James Callaghan]] arrived back from a [[Guadeloupe Conference|summit in Guadeloupe]] in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. Having been tipped off that the press were present, his press secretary Tom McCaffrey advised him to say nothing and return immediately to work, but his political adviser [[Thomas McNally, Baron McNally|Tom McNally]] thought that the image of Callaghan returning and declaring his intent to take control of the situation would be reassuring. Callaghan therefore decided to give a press conference at [[Heathrow Airport]]. To McNally's dismay Callaghan was jocular and referred to having had a swim in the Caribbean during the summit. He was then asked (by a reporter from the ''[[Evening Standard]]'') \"What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?\" and replied:\n\n{{Quote|Well, that's a judgment that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.}}\n\nThe next day's edition of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' featured the famous headline \"Crisis? What crisis?\" with a subheading \"Rail, lorry, jobs chaos \u2013 and Jim blames Press\", condemning Callaghan as being \"out of touch\" with British society.<ref name=bbc>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml BBC News \u2013 History of the Winter of Discontent]</ref>\n\n==Public sector employees==\n22 January 1979 was the biggest individual day of strike action since the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] of 1926, and many workers stayed out indefinitely afterwards.  With many in the private sector having achieved substantial rises, the public sector unions became increasingly concerned to keep pace in terms of pay. The government had already announced a slight weakening of the policy on 16 January, which gave the unions cause for hope that they might win and use free collective bargaining. Train drivers belonging to [[ASLEF]] and the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] had already begun a series of 24-hour strikes, and the [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference on 18 January decided to ask that the pay of nurses be increased to the same level in real terms as 1974, which would mean a 25% average rise.  The public sector unions labelled the date the \"Day of Action\", in which they held a 24-hour strike and marched to demand a \u00a360 per week minimum wage.\n\nWith the succession of strikes having been called and then won, many groups of workers began to take unofficial action \u2013 often without the consent or support of the union leaderships. Ambulance drivers began to take strike action in mid-January, and in parts of the country (London, West Midlands, [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]] and the west of Scotland) their action included refusing to attend 999 emergency calls. In these areas, the Army was drafted in to provide a skeleton service. Ancillary hospital staff also went on strike.<ref name=bbc/> On 30 January, the [[Secretary of State for Social Services]] [[David Ennals]] announced that 1,100 of 2,300 [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals were only treating emergencies, that practically no ambulance service was operating normally, and that the ancillary health service workers were deciding which cases merited treatment. The media reported with scorn that [[cancer]] patients were being prevented from getting essential treatment.\n\n===Gravediggers' strike===\nA notorious industrial action during the winter, and one which was later frequently referred to by Conservative politicians, was the strike by gravediggers, members of the [[GMWU]] in [[Liverpool]] and in [[Tameside]] near [[Manchester]].<ref>Moore (2014), p. 399.</ref> Eighty gravediggers being on strike, [[Liverpool City Council]] hired a factory in [[Speke]] to store the corpses until they could be buried. The Department of Environment noted that there were 150 bodies stored at the factory at one point, with 25 more added every day. The reports of unburied bodies caused concern with the public.<ref name=\"Travis\">{{cite news|last=Travis|first=Alan|title=National archives: Fear of fights at cemetery gates during 1979 winter of discontent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/liverpool-gravedigger-strikes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 December 2009}}</ref> On 1 February a persistent journalist asked the Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, Dr Duncan Bolton, what would be done if the strike continued for months, Bolton speculated that [[burial at sea]] would be considered. Although his response was hypothetical, in the circumstances it caused great alarm. Other alternatives were considered, including allowing the bereaved to dig their own funeral's graves, deploying troops, and engaging private contractors to inter the bodies.  The main concerns were said to be aesthetic because bodies could be safely stored in heat-sealed bags for up to six weeks.<ref name=\"Travis\"/> Bolton later reported being \"horrified\" by the sensationalised reportage of the strike in the mass media.<ref>James Thomas, '\"Bound by History\": The Winter of Discontent in British Politics 1979\u20132004', ''Media, Culture and Society'', 29 (2007), p. 270.</ref> The gravediggers eventually settled for a 14% rise after a fortnight's strike.\n\n===Waste collectors===\nWith many collectors having been on strike since 22 January, local authorities began to run out of space for storing waste and used local parks under their control. The Conservative controlled [[Westminster City Council]] used [[Leicester Square]] in the heart of London's West End for piles of rubbish and, as the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' reported, this attracted [[rat]]s.\n\nOn 21 February, a settlement of the local authority workers' dispute was agreed, whereby workers got an 11% rise, plus \u00a31 per week, with the possibility of extra rises, should a pay comparability study recommend them. Some left-wing local authorities, among them the [[London Borough of Camden]], conceded the union demands in full (known as the \"Camden surplus\") and then saw an investigation by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|District Auditor]], which eventually ruled it a breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]]{{refn|Owed to the payers, the ratepayers of the area|group= n}} and therefore illegal. Camden Borough councillors, among them [[Ken Livingstone]], avoided [[Surcharge (sanction on public servant)|surcharge]]. Livingstone was Leader of the [[Greater London Council]] at the time the decision not to impose a surcharge was made.\n\n==End of the strikes==\nStrikes by essential services dismayed many senior ministers in the Labour government who had been close to the trade union movement, who had thought it unlikely that trade unionists would take such action. Among these was Prime Minister James Callaghan himself, who had built his political career on his connection to the trade unions, and had practically founded one, the [[Inland Revenue Staff Federation]]. Callaghan called the actions of the strikers \"free collective vandalism\".<ref>{{cite web |title=CALLAGHAN DEPICTS STRIKERS AS VANDALS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/callaghan-depicts-strikers-as-vandals-britons-woes-mount-as-workers.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=30 November 2019 |date=2 February 1979}}</ref><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe government was negotiating with the senior union leaders and on 11 February came to agreement on a proposal to be put to the TUC General Council. On 14 February the General Council agreed the concordat, published under the title \"The Economy, the Government, and Trade Union Responsibilities\".{{refn|The significance of a comprehensive agreement on [[Valentine's Day]] was remarked upon by the press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}|group= n}} By this stage union executives had limited control over their members and strikes did not immediately cease, although they began to wind down from this point. In total in 1979, 29,474,000 working days were lost in industrial disputes, compared with 9,306,000 in 1978.\n\n==Political fallout==\nIn the summer before the Winter of Discontent, the minority Labour government's fortunes in the opinion polls had been improving and suggested that they could gain an overall majority in the event of a general election being held. However, on 7 September 1978, Callaghan announced that no general election would be held that year. Callaghan's failure to call an election would ultimately prove to be a costly mistake for his government.<ref name=calruns>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm |work=BBC News | title=1978: Callaghan accused of running scared | date=7 September 1978}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thatcher-loc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]], who won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and became Prime Minister]]\nThe strikes appeared to have a profound effect on voting intention. According to [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], Labour had a lead of 5 percentage points over the Conservatives in November 1978, which turned to a Conservative lead of 7.5 percentage points in January 1979, and of 20 percentage points in February. On 1 March, referendums on [[devolution]] to Scotland and Wales were held. That in Wales went strongly against devolution; that in Scotland produced a small majority in favour which did not reach the threshold set by Parliament of 40% of the electorate. The government's decision not to press ahead with devolution immediately led the [[Scottish National Party]] to withdraw support from the government and on 28 March in a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|motion of no confidence the government lost by one vote]], precipitating a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]].\n\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] had already outlined her proposals for restricting trade union power in a [[party political broadcast]] on 17 January in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. During the election campaign the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] made extensive use of the disruption caused during the strike. One broadcast on 23 April began with the Sun's headline \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" being shown and read out by an increasingly desperate voiceover interspersed with film footage of piles of rubbish, closed factories, picketed hospitals and locked graveyards. The scale of the Conservatives' victory in the general election has often been ascribed to the effect of the strikes, as well as their \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign, and the party used film of the events of the winter in election campaigns for years to come.\n\nFollowing Thatcher's election win, she brought the [[post-war consensus]] to a halt and made drastic changes to trade union laws (most notably the regulation that unions had to hold a ballot among members before calling strikes) and as a result strikes were at their lowest level for 30 years by the time of the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], which the Conservatives won by a landslide.<ref name=\"83electionyoutube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7noHkLaZ5VI|title=Conservative Party Election Broadcast (1983)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Organized labour|United Kingdom}}\n\n* [[Three-Day Week]]{{refn|The Three-Day Week was the [[Heath government]]'s reaction to the [[coal mining|coal miner]]s' [[work-to-rule]] and strikes in 1974, that had a similarly disastrous impact on the government's popularity and led to the period of [[Labour government, 1974\u20131979|Labour government]] in the intervening years [[1979 United Kingdom general election|until 1979]].|group=n}}\n* [[Labour Isn't Working]]\n* [[Strike wave of 1945\u201346]], in U.S., followed by election of conservative Republican majorities in Congress who also passed laws restricting union activities\n* [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Beckett, Andy.

Several local miners' lodges had supported their defence, and the RCP had sent a prominent member, [[John Lawrence (political activist)|John Lawrence]], as a full-time organiser for the area, recruiting some activists in [[Merthyr Tydfil]], [[Llanelli]] and [[Swansea]].<ref name=\"war\" />\n\nThe party stood on a [[revolutionary]] [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] platform, declaring \"Our candidate will fight on a platform of uncompromising hostility to the imperialist war, for the breaking of the Coalition, for the overthrow of the Churchill Government and for Labour to take power on a Socialist platform.\"<ref name=\"appeal\" /> Their main slogan was \"Break the Coalition, Labour to Power\".<ref name=\"war\" />\n\n==Campaign==\nThe Communist Party offered its full support to the Labour candidate and campaigned against the RCP, using the slogan \"A Vote for Haston is a Vote for Hitler\".  Williams repudiated the Communist support, opposing its policy of a [[popular front]] with the Conservatives and Labour after the war.<ref name=\"war\" />\n\nAfter repeated requests from the RCP, the CPGB agreed to hold a debate in Neath, putting up Alun Thomas, leader of the Communist Party in West Wales, against Haston.  The meeting attracted about 1,500 voters, who heard Thomas claim that \"In Russia they defeated fascism because they shot all the Trotskyists and the Fifth column scum, and if we had our way, these people on this platform would be shot.\"<ref name=\"appeal\" />\n\nThe local [[Independent Labour Party]] was small, and was split as to how to respond to the election.  Two of their local activists campaigned for and subsequently joined the RCP.<ref>[[Jim Higgins (British politician)|Jim Higgins]], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/higgins/1963/xx/10years.htm Ten Years for the Locust]</ref>\n\nIn the final week of the campaign, the war in Europe was concluded and [[VE Day]] was held, overshadowing the by-election.<ref name=\"polling\" /> Although it was apparent that Labour would not agree to continue the coalition and would compel Churchill to call a [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]], the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' called on all Conservative and Liberal supporters to vote for Williams.<ref name=\"war\" />\n\n==Results==\nWilliams retained the seat for Labour with a large majority, and held it until his retirement at the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]].  Samuels retained his deposit in a distant second place.  Haston took only 1,781 votes, losing his deposit,<ref name=\"deposit\" /> but the RCP claimed the campaign a success and maintained a full-time organiser in the area.  Haston remained on good terms with Williams, and when the RCP disintegrated in 1950, Williams assisted him in finding employment with the [[National Council of Labour Colleges]].<ref name=\"war\"/>\n\n{{Election box begin |title=[[1945 Neath by-election]]<ref name=\"Craig, F.

The bacteria generally enter the body through wounds, inhalation, or ingestion. Person-to-person or animal-to-human transmission is extremely rare.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The infection is constantly present in Southeast Asia particularly in northeast [[Thailand]] and northern Australia.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> In developed countries such as Europe and the United States, melioidosis cases are usually imported from countries where melioidosis is more common.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> The signs and symptoms of melioidosis can resemble [[tuberculosis]], and misdiagnosis is common.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> Diagnosis is usually confirmed by the growth of ''B. pseudomallei'' from an infected person's blood or other bodily fluid.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Those with melioidosis are generally treated first with an \"intensive phase\" course of intravenous antibiotics (most commonly [[ceftazidime]]) followed by a several month treatment course of [[co-trimoxazole]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Even if the disease is properly treated, approximately 10% of people with melioidosis die from the disease. If the disease is improperly treated, the death rate could be more than 40%.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nEfforts to prevent melioidosis include: wearing protective gear while handling contaminated water, practising hand hygiene, drinking boiled water, and avoiding direct contact with soil, water, or heavy rain.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The [[antibiotic]] [[co-trimoxazole]] is used as a preventative only for individuals at high risk for getting the disease after being exposed to the bacteria.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> There is no approved vaccine for melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nApproximately 165,000 people are infected by melioidosis per year, resulting in about 89,000 deaths.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Diabetes]] is a major risk factor for melioidosis; over half of melioidosis cases are in people with diabetes.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Increased rainfall is associated with increased number of melioidosis cases in [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] areas.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> The disease was first described by Alfred Whitmore in 1912 in present-day [[Myanmar]].<ref name=\"Whitmore 1912\"/>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n===Acute===\n[[File:Signs of melioidosis.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Schematic depiction of the signs of melioidosis]]\n[[File:Melioidosis PA and lateral X rays.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Chest X-ray showing opacity of the left middle and lower zones of the lung.]]\n[[File:CT and MRI scan of the brain with melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|CT and MRI scans showing lesion of the right frontal lobe of the brain.]]\n[[File:Septic arthritis of left hip joint with melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Septic arthritis of the left hip with joint destruction.]]\nMost people exposed to ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei|B. pseudomallei]]'' experience no symptoms.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> For those who do experience symptoms, 85% experience acute melioidosis.<ref name=\"Bennett 2015\">{{cite book |vauthors=Bennett JE, Raphael D, Martin JB, Currie BJ |title=Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases|chapter=223 |date=2015 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1-4557-4801-3 |pages=2541\u20132549 |edition=Eighth}}</ref> The mean [[incubation period]] of acute melioidosis is 9 days (range 1&ndash;21 days).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, symptoms of melioidosis can appear in 24 hours for those experienced near drowning in water.<ref name=\"Bennett 2015\"/> Those affected present with symptoms of [[sepsis]] (predominantly fever) with or without [[pneumonia]], or localised [[abscess]] or other focus of infection. The presence of non-specific signs and symptoms has caused melioidosis to be nicknamed \"the great mimicker\".<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nPeople with [[diabetes mellitus]] or regular exposure to the bacteria are at increased risk of developing melioidosis. The disease should be considered in anyone staying in endemic areas who develops fever, pneumonia, or abscesses in their liver, spleen, prostate, or parotid gland.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The clinical manifestation of the disease can range from simple skin changes to severe organ problems.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> In northern Australia, 60% of the infected children presented with only skin lesions, while 20% presented with pneumonia.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> The commonest organs affected are: liver, spleen, lungs, prostate, and kidneys. Among the most common clinical signs are [[bacteremia|presence of bacteria in blood]] (in 40 to 60% of cases), pneumonia (50%), and [[septic shock]] (20%).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People with only pneumonia may have a prominent cough with sputum and shortness of breath.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

In middle to low-income countries, water should be boiled before consumption. In high income countries, water could be treated with ultraviolet light for those at risk of contracting melioidosis. Those who are at high risk of contact with the bacteria should wear protective gear (such as boots and gloves) during work.

The time taken for fever to be resolved can be more than 10 days in those with deep-seated infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The dosage for intravenous ceftazidime is 2g 6-hourly in adults (50&nbsp;mg/kg up to 2g in children less than 15 years old). The dosage for meropenem is 1g 8-hourly in adults (25&nbsp;mg/kg up to 1g in children).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Resistance to ceftazidime, carbapenems, and co-amoxiclav are rare in the intensive phase but are more prominent during eradication therapy. There are no differences between using cefoperazone/sulbactam or ceftazidime to treat melioidosis as both show similar death rates and disease progression following treatment.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> For those with kidney impairment, the dosage of ceftazidime, meropenem, and co-trimoxazole should be lowered.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Once the clinical condition improved, meropenem can be switched back to ceftazidime.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n===Eradication phase===\nFollowing the treatment of the acute disease, eradication (or maintenance) treatment with [[co-trimoxazole]] is the drug of choice and should be used for at least 3 months. For those with neurological melioidosis and [[osteomyelitis]], drugs should be given for more than 6 months. Co-amoxiclav and [[doxycycline]] are drugs of second choice. Co-trimoxazole should not be used in those with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] deficiency as it can cause [[haemolytic anemia]]. Other side effects such as rash, [[hyperkalemia]], renal dysfunction, and gastrointestinal symptoms should prompt the reduction of co-trimoxazole doses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Chloramphenicol]] is no longer routinely recommended for this purpose.

Meanwhile, in Thailand, co-amoxiclav is the drug of choice for children and pregnant women. However, ''B. pseudomallei'' often acquires resistance when this drug is used.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The dosing regimen for co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) in eradication phase is 6/30&nbsp;mg/kg, up to maximum 240/1200&nbsp;mg in children, 240/1200&nbsp;mg in adults weighing 40 to 60&nbsp;kg, and 320/1600&nbsp;mg in adults weighing more than 60&nbsp;kg, taken orally every 12 hours. In children, co-trimoxazole is taken together with [[folic acid]] (0.1&nbsp;mg/kg up to 5&nbsp;mg in children). There are also cases where melioidosis is successfully treated with co-trimoxazole for 3 months without going through intensive therapy provided that there is only skin manifestations without involvement of internal organs or sepsis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Resistance to cotrimoxazole is rare in Australia.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/>\n\n===Surgery===\nSurgical drainage is indicated for single, large abscesses in the liver, muscle, and prostate. However, for multiple abscesses in the liver, spleen, and kidney, surgical drainage may not be possible or necessary. For septic arthritis, [[arthrotomy]] washout and drainage is required. Surgical [[debridement]] may be necessary. For those with [[mycotic aneurysm]], urgent surgery is required for prosthetic vascular grafts. Life-long therapy with co-trimoxazole may be needed for those with prosthetic vascular grafts. Other abscesses rarely need to be drained because the majority of them can resolve with antibiotic treatment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> In Australia, prostate abscess may require routine imaging and drainage.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\n===Others===\nImmunomodulating therapies such as [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]], [[Interleukin 7]], and anti-PDI ([[programmed cell death]]) could be useful in melioidosis treatment especially for those with septic shock. This is because these drugs could help to boost the human body immune function against the bacteria.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nIn well-resourced settings, where the disease can be detected and treated early, the risk of death is 10%. In resource-poor settings, the risk of death from the disease is more than 40%.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nFor those with incomplete treatment, reppearance of symptoms after a period of disease [[cure|remission]] (\"[[recrudescence]]\") can occur. Then, hospital admission is needed for intravenous antibiotics. For those who have completed treatment successfully, recurrence can also occur due to recrudescence or new melioidosis infection. With better therapies, the recrudescence rate has reduced from 10% to 5%. New infection is now more common than recrudescence.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Risk factors of recrudescence include severity of disease (patients with positive blood cultures or multifocal disease have a higher risk of relapse), choice of antibiotic for eradication therapy (doxycycline monotherapy and fluoroquinolone therapy are not as effective), poor compliance with eradication therapy and duration of eradication therapy less than 8 weeks.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Direk2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaowagul W, Suputtamongkol Y, Dance DA, Rajchanuvong A, Pattara-arechachai J, White NJ | year=1993 | title=Relapse in melioidosis: incidence and risk factors | journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume=168 | pages=1181&ndash;1185 | pmid=8228352 | issue=5 | doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1181}}</ref>\n\nUnderlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and cancer can worsen the long-term survival and disability of those who recover from infection.
