In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells.\n\nCharacteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref>\n\nILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood. They are particularly abundant at mucosal surfaces, playing a key role in mucosal immunity and [[homeostasis]].\n\nBased on the difference in developmental pathways, phenotype, and signalling molecules produced, in 2013, ILCs were divided into three groups: 1, 2 and 3, however, after further investigation, we now appreciate five distinct subsets within these groups: [[natural killer cell|NK cells]], ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s, and LTi cells.<ref name=\"SpitsArtis2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Spits|first1=Hergen|last2=Artis|first2=David|last3=Colonna|first3=Marco|last4=Diefenbach|first4=Andreas|last5=Di Santo|first5=James P.|last6=Eberl|first6=Gerard|last7=Koyasu|first7=Shigeo|last8=Locksley|first8=Richard M.|last9=McKenzie|first9=Andrew N.

They often reside at [[Mucous membrane|mucosal surfaces]], where they are exposed to infectious agents in the environment.\n\n===Helminth infection===\n\nILC2 cells play a crucial role in the protection against helminthic infection. They are a major early source of [[Interleukin 13|IL-13]], which can activate T cells and induce physiological responses that will help expel a parasite. These physiological responses include stimulating [[goblet cell]] mucus secretion and contraction of smooth muscle. In addition, they secrete signals that recruit and activate mast cells and [[eosinophils]], and which stimulate B cell proliferation. They also secrete [[Amphiregulin]], a member of the epidermal growth factor family, that stimulates tissue repair. This can function to enhance the barrier function of the epithelium and slow pathogen entry.<ref name=\"autogenerated465\">{{cite journal|last=Palm|first=Noah W.|author2=Rosenstein, Rachel K. |author3=Medzhitov, Ruslan |title=Allergic host defences|journal=Nature|date=25 April 2012|volume=484|issue=7395|pages=465\u2013472|doi=10.1038/nature11047|pmid=22538607|pmc=3596087|bibcode=2012Natur.484..465P}}</ref>\n\n===Enteric pathogens===\n\nIn the environment of intestinal tract, ILC3s have a crucial role in mediating the balance between symbiotic [[Microbiome|microbiota]] and the [[Mucosal immune system|intestinal immune system]].

Further, allergic responses that resemble asthma-like symptoms have been induced in mice that lack T and B cells using IL-33.

After trading Alexander in 1917, the franchise had one of the worst stretches in professional sports history, as it managed just one winning season between 1918 and 1948. The [[Whiz Kids (baseball)|\"Whiz Kid\"]] Phillies, led by pitcher [[Robin Roberts (baseball)|Robin Roberts]], reached the [[1950 World Series]], but the team was swept by the [[New York Yankees]].

The Athletics declined after their victory in the 1930 World Series, and usually finished below .500 in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. The Athletics were one of several [[Major League Baseball relocation of 1950s\u201360s|MLB teams that relocated in the 1950s and 1960s]], moving to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] after the 1954 season.

They have operated continuously since then, with the partial exception of the [[1943 NFL season|1943 season]], when the Eagles temporarily merged with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] to become the [[Steagles]]. The Eagles have won three [[List of NFL champions|NFL titles]] ([[1948 NFL season|1948]], [[1949 NFL season|1949]], [[1960 NFL season|1960]]), four conference championships, and 13 division championships. They have made three [[Super Bowl]] appearances, losing in [[Super Bowl XV]] and [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], and winning [[Super Bowl LII]]. The franchise frequently finished at the bottom of the standings in the 1930s, but improved in the 1940s, and became the only NFL team to win back to back championships by shutout (in 1948 and 1949). Though the franchise was average for much of the 1950s, the 1960 championship-winning Eagles were the only team to defeat the [[Vince Lombardi]]-coached [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] in a playoff game. The Eagles did not experience much success in the 1960s and early 1970s, but the franchise made four straight playoff appearances starting in 1978, including a Super Bowl appearance in 1980. After another down period, the franchise made the playoffs in six of nine seasons between 1988 and 1996. [[Andy Reid]] was hired as head coach in 1999, and across 14 seasons he led the franchise to nine playoff appearances and a run to [[Super Bowl XXXIX]]. After [[Chip Kelly]]'s three-year tenure as head coach, the Eagles hired [[Doug Pederson]], a former offensive coordinator under Reid.

[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]rs [[Guy Chamberlin]] and [[William R.

The [[Pottsville Maroons]], a member of the [[National Football League]], played in nearby [[Pottsville, Pennsylvania|Pottsville]] during the 1920s. In 1925, the Maroons were [[1925 NFL Championship controversy|briefly suspended]] from the NFL for playing an unauthorized exhibition game at Philadelphia's [[Shibe Park]]. The team moved to Boston in 1929, but folded at the end of the season. The [[Philadelphia Quakers (AFL)|Philadelphia Quakers]] played one season in Philadelphia as part of the [[American Football League (1926)|American Football League]], a fledgling league intent on challenging the NFL as the premier football league in the country. The team took its name from the [[Union Quakers of Philadelphia]], a local club which had been denied entry into the American Professional Football Association (as the NFL was known before 1922). The AFL Quakers won the league championship in 1926, giving Philadelphia two football championships in one year, as the Frankford Yellow Jackets won the 1926 NFL title. However, both the AFL and the Quakers folded after just one season of existence. The [[Philadelphia Bell]] was a franchise of the [[World Football League]], which operated from 1974 to 1975 and attempted to challenge the NFL's dominance. The league was founded by [[Gary Davidson]], who had also led the founding of World Hockey Association and the American Basketball Association, but the WFL folded after only two years and no teams were absorbed into the NFL. The Bell played its home games in [[John F.

The franchise won its first championship in [[1954\u201355 NBA season|1955]], as the Nationals. After moving to Philadelphia in 1963 and being renamed the 76ers, the franchise acquired [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and experienced a great period of success.

The Royals won the [[Kelly Cup|league championship]] for the first time in 2013. The Flyers have had other [[List of Philadelphia Flyers minor league affiliates|affiliates]] in Eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The [[Trenton Titans]] of [[Trenton, New Jersey]] played in the [[ECHL]] from 1999\u20132013, and served as the affiliate of the Flyers before they were bought by the [[New Jersey Devils]]. The [[Hershey Bears]] of [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]] are the oldest continuously-operating professional hockey franchise outside of the NHL's [[Original Six]]. The Bears served as the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate of the Flyers for parts of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nPhiladelphia has had several minor league hockey teams play in the city and the surrounding area. The [[Philadelphia Arrows]] were the first hockey franchise in city history, playing in the [[Canadian-American Hockey League]] from 1927\u20131935. The franchise changed its name to the [[Philadelphia Ramblers]] before the 1935\u201336 season and joined the [[American Hockey League]], where it won the 1936 league championship (the year before the league introduced the [[Calder Cup]]). The team acted as the primary affiliate of the [[New York Rangers]] from 1935\u20131941. The [[Philadelphia Falcons]] played in the [[Eastern Hockey League]] from 1942\u20131946, before jumping to the [[American Hockey League]] and playing as the [[Philadelphia Rockets]] from 1946\u20131949. Another franchise named the [[Philadelphia Ramblers (EHL)|Ramblers]] played in the [[Eastern Hockey League|EHL]] from 1955\u20131964; the Ramblers moved to [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]] and played as the [[Jersey Devils]] from 1964\u20131973. A previous [[Eastern Hockey League|EHL]] [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey|Cherry Hill]] team named the [[Jersey Larks]] had played one season in 1960\u20131961. The [[Philadelphia Firebirds (hockey)|Philadelphia Firebirds]] were a minor-league hockey team that played in the [[Philadelphia Civic Center]] from 1974\u20131979. They played in the [[North American Hockey League]] from 1974\u20131977, winning the league championship in 1976. When the NAHL folded in 1977, they joined the [[American Hockey League]]. The team moved to [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] in 1979, but folded in 1980.   Another short-lived team which played in the Centrum (the renamed Cherry Hill Arena) was the [[Jersey/Hampton Aces|Jersey Aces]], which started the 1979-80 [[Eastern Hockey League (1978-1981)|Northeastern Hockey League]] season in Cherry Hill but moved mid-season, playing the final 18 games of its season in Hampton, VA where it continued operating until 1981.\n\n===Basketball===\nThe [[Delaware Blue Coats]] are the [[NBA G League]] affiliate of the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. Since the 2018\u201319 season, the franchise has played at the [[76ers Fieldhouse]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. The Blue Coats franchise is named in honor of the [[198th Signal Battalion (United States)|198th Signal Battalion]], which fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Blue Coats were founded as the [[Utah Flash]] in 2007, but the Flash suspended operations in 2011.

After trading Alexander in 1917, the franchise had one of the worst stretches in professional sports history, as it managed just one winning season between 1918 and 1948. The [[Whiz Kids (baseball)|\"Whiz Kid\"]] Phillies, led by pitcher [[Robin Roberts (baseball)|Robin Roberts]], reached the [[1950 World Series]], but the team was swept by the [[New York Yankees]]. The team finished towards the middle of the pack for much of the 1950s and 1960s.

The Athletics declined after their victory in the 1930 World Series, and usually finished below .500 in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. The Athletics were one of several [[Major League Baseball relocation of 1950s\u201360s|MLB teams that relocated in the 1950s and 1960s]], moving to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] after the 1954 season.

They have operated continuously since then, with the partial exception of the [[1943 NFL season|1943 season]], when the Eagles temporarily merged with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] to become the [[Steagles]]. The Eagles have won three [[List of NFL champions|NFL titles]] ([[1948 NFL season|1948]], [[1949 NFL season|1949]], [[1960 NFL season|1960]]), four conference championships, and 13 division championships. They have made three [[Super Bowl]] appearances, losing in [[Super Bowl XV]] and [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], and winning [[Super Bowl LII]]. The franchise frequently finished at the bottom of the standings in the 1930s, but improved in the 1940s, and became the only NFL team to win back to back championships by shutout (in 1948 and 1949). Though the franchise was average for much of the 1950s, the 1960 championship-winning Eagles were the only team to defeat the [[Vince Lombardi]]-coached [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] in a playoff game. The Eagles did not experience much success in the 1960s and early 1970s, but the franchise made four straight playoff appearances starting in 1978, including a Super Bowl appearance in 1980. After another down period, the franchise made the playoffs in six of nine seasons between 1988 and 1996. [[Andy Reid]] was hired as head coach in 1999, and across 14 seasons he led the franchise to nine playoff appearances and a run to [[Super Bowl XXXIX]].

[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]rs [[Guy Chamberlin]] and [[William R.

The [[Pottsville Maroons]], a member of the [[National Football League]], played in nearby [[Pottsville, Pennsylvania|Pottsville]] during the 1920s. In 1925, the Maroons were [[1925 NFL Championship controversy|briefly suspended]] from the NFL for playing an unauthorized exhibition game at Philadelphia's [[Shibe Park]]. The team moved to Boston in 1929, but folded at the end of the season. The [[Philadelphia Quakers (AFL)|Philadelphia Quakers]] played one season in Philadelphia as part of the [[American Football League (1926)|American Football League]], a fledgling league intent on challenging the NFL as the premier football league in the country. The team took its name from the [[Union Quakers of Philadelphia]], a local club which had been denied entry into the American Professional Football Association (as the NFL was known before 1922). The AFL Quakers won the league championship in 1926, giving Philadelphia two football championships in one year, as the Frankford Yellow Jackets won the 1926 NFL title. However, both the AFL and the Quakers folded after just one season of existence. The [[Philadelphia Bell]] was a franchise of the [[World Football League]], which operated from 1974 to 1975 and attempted to challenge the NFL's dominance. The league was founded by [[Gary Davidson]], who had also led the founding of World Hockey Association and the American Basketball Association, but the WFL folded after only two years and no teams were absorbed into the NFL.

The franchise won its first championship in [[1954\u201355 NBA season|1955]], as the Nationals. After moving to Philadelphia in 1963 and being renamed the 76ers, the franchise acquired [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and experienced a great period of success.

It is the home of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], the city's [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise. It opened April 3, 2004, and hosted its first regular-season baseball game on April 12 of the same year, with the Phillies losing to the [[Cincinnati Reds]], 4\u20131.\n\nThe ballpark was built to replace the 33-year-old, now-demolished [[Veterans Stadium]], a [[American football|football]]/baseball multipurpose facility, and features a natural grass-and-dirt playing field and a number of Philadelphia-style food stands that serve [[cheesesteak]] sandwiches, [[hoagies]], [[Tastykake]]s, [[soft pretzels]], [[Yards Brewing Company|Yards]] and [[Yuengling]] beer, and many other regional specialties. The ballpark lies on the northeast corner of the Sports Complex, which includes [[Lincoln Financial Field]], the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]], and [[Xfinity Live!]], the Center's adjacent theme park and food court. The stadium seats 42,792.\n\n==History==\n\n===Planning===\nIn 1999, the Phillies and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] joined their [[western Pennsylvania]] counterparts, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], in making requests to replace both [[Veterans Stadium]] and [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]] with separate baseball and football stadiums. Pressure for new Philadelphia stadiums increased after a railing collapsed at The Vet during the 1998 [[Army\u2013Navy Game]], injuring eight cadets. The Pirates threatened to leave Pittsburgh in 1997, helping to convince the state legislature to approve funding for the four proposed stadiums. With their architectural plans already in place, [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] and the City of Pittsburgh approved the pacts swiftly, but debate in Philadelphia's city leadership continued even as Pittsburgh opened its stadiums, ([[PNC Park]] for the Pirates and [[Heinz Field]] for the Steelers), in 2001. The Eagles ultimately agreed to the site of a former food warehouse slightly southeast of Veterans Stadium. [[Lincoln Financial Field]] celebrated its grand opening in August 2003.\n[[File:Citizens Bank Park, May 2009.jpg|thumb|left|The Phillies taking on the New York Mets at Citizens Bank Park]]\nThe Phillies originally sought to build a downtown ballpark similar to [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards|Baltimore]]'s, [[Coors Field|Denver]]'s, [[Great American Ball Park|Cincinnati]]'s, [[Progressive Field|Cleveland]]'s, [[Comerica Park|Detroit]]'s and [[AT&T Park|San Francisco]]'s. Various locations were proposed, including Broad and Spring Garden streets; Spring Garden and Delaware Avenue; and next to [[30th Street Station]] on the site of the former main post office. The team and the city announced that the site would be at 13th and Vine streets in [[Chinatown, Philadelphia|Chinatown]], just north of Interstate 676, within walking distance of [[Center City Philadelphia|Center City]]. There was considerable support for a downtown ball park from business and labor and the city at large. But Chinatown residents protested, fearing a new ballpark would destroy their neighborhood. The City and team eventually settled on building at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex on the site of another abandoned food warehouse. In the years that followed, residents, fans, and owner [[Bill Giles (baseball)|Bill Giles]] expressed regret that the new ball park was not located in Center City. Regardless of location, however, the team set attendance records in [[2010 Philadelphia Phillies season|2010]] (3,647,249 fans, averaging 45,028) with all home games sold out for the first time in the team's long history (81), extending a sellout streak dating back to July of [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|2009]] to 123.<ref>[http://sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=mlb/teams/008/attendance.aspx?team=008 Phillies attendance figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716125657/http://sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=mlb%2Fteams%2F008%2Fattendance.aspx%3Fteam%3D008 |date=2011-07-16 }}, sportsnetwork.com, retrieved October 6, 2010.</ref>\n\nChief architect of the new stadium was EwingCole's [[Stanley Cole (architect)|Stanley Cole]].<ref name=philly>{{cite news|first=Bonnie L.|last=Cook|title=Stanley M.

Prior to 2010, a huge {{convert|22|ft|m}} high baseball themed pinball game was in this area. Players earn coupons and exchange them for prizes at a kiosk such as hats, shirts and other ballpark-imprinted memorabilia.\n*'''Harry The K's Bar and Grille''' \u2014 Named for late Phillies broadcaster [[Harry Kalas]], the bi-level bar and grill is built into the base of the [[scoreboard]], and serves finger foods and sandwiches, including \"The Schmitter\".\n[[File:Harry the K's Restaurant Menu Board, Citizens Bank Park.jpg|thumbnail|The menu board at Harry the K's Restaurant at Citizens Bank Park]]\n\n*'''Memory Lane''' and '''[[Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame|Phillies Wall of Fame]]''' \u2014 A history of baseball in Philadelphia is located behind the brick batting eye in center field, while the opposite wall commemorates members of the franchise who contributed to the franchise's history. It was in this area where [[Ryan Howard]] hit two of the park's longest home runs, on April 23, 2006 against the Marlins off Sergio Mitre, and against Aaron Harang of the Reds on June 27, 2007, currently the longest home run at Citizen's Bank Park at {{convert|505|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reuter|first1=Joel|title=bleacherreport.com/articles/1211802-the-longest-moon-shot-home-run-in-the-history-of-each-mlb-stadium/page/8|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1211802-the-longest-moon-shot-home-run-in-the-history-of-each-mlb-stadium/page/8}}</ref> Second baseman [[Chase Utley]]'s homer was also into this area against the Astros on April 23, 2007 clearing the center wall and becoming only the second player to reach the Memory Lane area after Howard.\n*'''Exposed [[Bullpen]]s''' \u2014 Located in right-center field, the bi-level bullpens allow the fans to get very close to the players (especially the visiting team, who sit in the top level). Fans are allowed to heckle but must keep it clean. The section above the bullpen that contains the Phillies Wall of Fame is closed to the public about 30 minutes prior to first pitch and remains closed throughout the game, re-opening at the game's conclusion.\n*'''Rooftop Bleachers''' \u2014 Inspired by the 1920s and 1930s stands on North 20th Street outside [[Connie Mack Stadium|Shibe Park]], this area replicates the seating similar to that outside [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago. During the 2008 season, fans could go on top for $15 on Thursday home dates and get special food offers and events.\n*'''Starting Lineup (2004-2017)''' \u2014 The Phillies starting lineup that day was illustrated by giant {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} by {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} baseball cards as fans entered the left field gate.\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, organist [[Paul Richardson (organist)|Paul Richardson]] performed from Ashburn Alley, as Citizens Bank Park was built without an organ booth.\n\n[[Image:spectrum panorama.jpg|thumb|center|550px|'''Citizens Bank Park''' (''right'') was the newest of the four locations comprising Philadelphia's \"Sports Complex\" when it opened in 2004; the four-decade-old '''[[Wachovia Spectrum]]''' (''center'') was the oldest (1967) (the arena closed October 31, 2009, and was demolished in 2011); to the left, tree-lined South Broad Street, the world's longest straight street; and the city's expansive skyline along the horizon to the north; in a photograph taken from the roof of the '''[[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]]''', built in 1996.]]\n\n===Other attractions===\n*'''Diamond and Hall of Fame Clubs''' \u2014 Two premium seating areas in the park. The Diamond Club, located behind home plate, includes an air-conditioned indoor club area with exclusive food and souvenir shops where ticket holders can watch batting practice on either side of the club (especially on rainy days). There are a total of 1,164 seats in the Diamond Club. A second level, called the Hall of Fame Club, is located between Sections 212 through 232. This air-conditioned area features exclusive food and souvenir stands akin to The Diamond Club, and also houses memorabilia from the teams' past going back to the 1880s, along with memorabilia from the Philadelphia Athletics. The Hall of Fame Club contains 6,600 seats. In addition to being an attraction to fans, the Hall of Fame level also houses the A/V crew on the first-base side of that level that controls the scoreboard and all other monitors throughout the park and is where [[Dan Baker (PA Announcer)|Dan Baker]] announces the game, as well as the press box, television, and radio booths.\n*'''High and Inside Pub''' \u2014 Located on the Terrace Level behind home plate, the area is open to groups before the ballgame, and the public once the games start.\n*'''Liberty Bell''' \u2014 Standing {{convert|102|ft|m}} above street level, this {{convert|52|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} by {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} mechanical, lighted replica of the [[Liberty Bell]] \"rings\" and lights up after every Phillies home run and victory. In recent years, the Phillies have promoted the [[hashtag]] \"#RingTheBell\".\n*'''New Era Phillies Team Store''' and ''''47 Alley Store''' \u2014 The team store is open year-round, and serves as the starting point for tours of the ballpark. The bi-level store features regular merchandise on the first level and player jerseys as well as Phanatic-themed items on the second level, while the Alley Store is open during all home games and features authentic replicas of older Phillies jerseys made by the famous Philadelphia retailer of vintage uniform shirts and caps, Mitchell and Ness, as well as other items. During the off-season, customizable jerseys are available in the main store when a stand next to the store is open during the season.\n*'''McFadden's Bar and Grille''' \u2014 Open year-round, this restaurant combined the McFadden's and Zanzibar Blue menus at the Third Base Gate. Since its opening, it has become a popular post-game (or event) site for the nearby Wells Fargo Center and Lincoln Financial Field. Closed in 2018.\n*'''Phanatic Phun Zone''' \u2014 Located at the First Base Gate plaza, this playground offers fun for guests eight years old and younger with slides, climb, explore and play games. A separate area for toddlers three years old and younger is found inside.\n*'''Phanatic Giant Shoe Slide''' \u2014 Located on the Terrace Level near home plate, kids could slide in and out of a replica of one of the Phanatic's sneakers.

It is the home of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], the city's [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise. It opened April 3, 2004, and hosted its first regular-season baseball game on April 12 of the same year, with the Phillies losing to the [[Cincinnati Reds]], 4\u20131.\n\nThe ballpark was built to replace the 33-year-old, now-demolished [[Veterans Stadium]], a [[American football|football]]/baseball multipurpose facility, and features a natural grass-and-dirt playing field and a number of Philadelphia-style food stands that serve [[cheesesteak]] sandwiches, [[hoagies]], [[Tastykake]]s, [[soft pretzels]], [[Yards Brewing Company|Yards]] and [[Yuengling]] beer, and many other regional specialties. The ballpark lies on the northeast corner of the Sports Complex, which includes [[Lincoln Financial Field]], the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]], and [[Xfinity Live!]], the Center's adjacent theme park and food court. The stadium seats 42,792.\n\n==History==\n\n===Planning===\nIn 1999, the Phillies and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] joined their [[western Pennsylvania]] counterparts, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], in making requests to replace both [[Veterans Stadium]] and [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]] with separate baseball and football stadiums. Pressure for new Philadelphia stadiums increased after a railing collapsed at The Vet during the 1998 [[Army\u2013Navy Game]], injuring eight cadets. The Pirates threatened to leave Pittsburgh in 1997, helping to convince the state legislature to approve funding for the four proposed stadiums. With their architectural plans already in place, [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] and the City of Pittsburgh approved the pacts swiftly, but debate in Philadelphia's city leadership continued even as Pittsburgh opened its stadiums, ([[PNC Park]] for the Pirates and [[Heinz Field]] for the Steelers), in 2001. The Eagles ultimately agreed to the site of a former food warehouse slightly southeast of Veterans Stadium. [[Lincoln Financial Field]] celebrated its grand opening in August 2003.\n[[File:\"Full House at Citizens Bank Park\" (Photo).jpg|thumb|left|The Phillies taking on the New York Mets at Citizens Bank Park]]\nThe Phillies originally sought to build a downtown ballpark similar to [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards|Baltimore]]'s, [[Coors Field|Denver]]'s, [[Great American Ball Park|Cincinnati]]'s, [[Progressive Field|Cleveland]]'s, [[Comerica Park|Detroit]]'s and [[AT&T Park|San Francisco]]'s. Various locations were proposed, including Broad and Spring Garden streets; Spring Garden and Delaware Avenue; and next to [[30th Street Station]] on the site of the former main post office. The team and the city announced that the site would be at 13th and Vine streets in [[Chinatown, Philadelphia|Chinatown]], just north of Interstate 676, within walking distance of [[Center City Philadelphia|Center City]]. There was considerable support for a downtown ball park from business and labor and the city at large. But Chinatown residents protested, fearing a new ballpark would destroy their neighborhood. The City and team eventually settled on building at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex on the site of another abandoned food warehouse. In the years that followed, residents, fans, and owner [[Bill Giles (baseball)|Bill Giles]] expressed regret that the new ball park was not located in Center City. Regardless of location, however, the team set attendance records in [[2010 Philadelphia Phillies season|2010]] (3,647,249 fans, averaging 45,028) with all home games sold out for the first time in the team's long history (81), extending a sellout streak dating back to July of [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|2009]] to 123.<ref>[http://sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=mlb/teams/008/attendance.aspx?team=008 Phillies attendance figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716125657/http://sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=mlb%2Fteams%2F008%2Fattendance.aspx%3Fteam%3D008 |date=2011-07-16 }}, sportsnetwork.com, retrieved October 6, 2010.</ref>\n\nChief architect of the new stadium was EwingCole's [[Stanley Cole (architect)|Stanley Cole]].<ref name=philly>{{cite news|first=Bonnie L.|last=Cook|title=Stanley M.

It is seen by Phillies fans as a compromise between the Phillies and their fans, many of whom wanted Citizens Bank Park named in honor of Ashburn.\n\nAshburn Alley is named for the slightly-overgrown grass which bordered the third base line at [[Shibe Park]] where Ashburn was famous for laying down bunts that stayed fair. The new Ashburn Alley, located near Ashburn's defensive position, is a walkway featuring restaurants, games and memorabilia from Phillies history.  Ashburn Alley also features a memorabilia shop and a large bronze statue of Ashburn directly behind center field, as well as the [[flag of the United States|U.S. flag]], the flags of the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] and the City of [[Philadelphia]], a [[POW/MIA flag]] and the flags from the Phillies' championships (below).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Philadelphia Phillies|border=2}};\"|Year\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Philadelphia Phillies|border=2}};\"|Event\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Philadelphia Phillies|border=2}};\"|Championship\n|-\n| {{mlby|1915}}\n| [[1915 World Series]]\n| [[National League]] champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1950}}\n| [[1950 World Series]]\n| National League champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1976}}\n| [[1976 National League Championship Series|1976 NLCS]]\n| [[National League East]] division champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1977}}\n| [[1977 National League Championship Series|1977 NLCS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1978}}\n| [[1978 National League Championship Series|1978 NLCS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1980}}\n| [[1980 World Series]]\n| [[World Series]] champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1983}}\n| [[1983 World Series]]\n| National League champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1993}}\n| [[1993 World Series]]\n| National League champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|2007}}\n| [[2007 National League Division Series#Philadelphia vs. Colorado|2007 NLDS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|2008}}\n| [[2008 World Series]]\n| World Series champion\n|-\n|{{mlby|2009}}\n| [[2009 World Series]]\n| National League champion\n|-\n|{{mlby|2010}}\n| [[2010 National League Championship Series|2010 NLCS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|-\n|{{mlby|2011}}\n| [[2011 National League Division Series#Philadelphia vs. St.Louis|2011 NLDS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|}\n\nFeatures of the Alley are:\n[[File:BullsBBQ.jpg|thumb|right|Bull's BBQ in Ashburn Alley]]\n[[File:Schmitter.jpg|thumb|The Schmitter]]\n*'''All-Star Walk''' \u2014 Granite markers pay tribute to Phillies players that have played in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] since its inception in 1933 and runs the length of Ashburn Alley.\n*'''Bull's BBQ''' \u2014 Relocated to left side of the scoreboard, out of the Alley (in the new \"Boardwalk Eats\" section), it is named in honor of and owned in part by former Phillies outfielder [[Greg Luzinski|Greg \"The Bull\" Luzinski]]. This southern-style [[barbecue]] features ribs, turkey legs along with pork, beef and chicken sandwiches and \"Bulldogs\" ([[kielbasa]]).\n*'''Seasons Pizza''' \u2013 A new pizza franchise in CBP that took over for Peace A Pizza starting in the 2008 season.\n*'''Planet Hoagie''' \u2013 Local franchise that makes [[hoagie]]s, including one named after a Phillies player each series.\n*'''Campo's''' \u2014 Philadelphia [[cheesesteaks]], replaced Rick's Steaks in 2009.

Prior to 2010, a huge {{convert|22|ft|m}} high baseball themed pinball game was in this area. Players earn coupons and exchange them for prizes at a kiosk such as hats, shirts and other ballpark-imprinted memorabilia.\n*'''Harry The K's Bar and Grille''' \u2014 Named for late Phillies broadcaster [[Harry Kalas]], the bi-level bar and grill is built into the base of the [[scoreboard]], and serves finger foods and sandwiches, including \"The Schmitter\".\n[[File:Harry the K's Restaurant Menu Board, Citizens Bank Park.jpg|thumbnail|The menu board at Harry the K's Restaurant at Citizens Bank Park]]\n\n*'''Memory Lane''' and '''[[Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame|Phillies Wall of Fame]]''' \u2014 A history of baseball in Philadelphia is located behind the brick batting eye in center field, while the opposite wall commemorates members of the franchise who contributed to the franchise's history. It was in this area where [[Ryan Howard]] hit two of the park's longest home runs, on April 23, 2006 against the Marlins off Sergio Mitre, and against Aaron Harang of the Reds on June 27, 2007, currently the longest home run at Citizen's Bank Park at {{convert|505|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reuter|first1=Joel|title=bleacherreport.com/articles/1211802-the-longest-moon-shot-home-run-in-the-history-of-each-mlb-stadium/page/8|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1211802-the-longest-moon-shot-home-run-in-the-history-of-each-mlb-stadium/page/8}}</ref> Second baseman [[Chase Utley]]'s homer was also into this area against the Astros on April 23, 2007 clearing the center wall and becoming only the second player to reach the Memory Lane area after Howard.\n*'''Exposed [[Bullpen]]s''' \u2014 Located in right-center field, the bi-level bullpens allow the fans to get very close to the players (especially the visiting team, who sit in the top level). Fans are allowed to heckle but must keep it clean. The section above the bullpen that contains the Phillies Wall of Fame is closed to the public about 30 minutes prior to first pitch and remains closed throughout the game, re-opening at the game's conclusion.\n*'''Rooftop Bleachers''' \u2014 Inspired by the 1920s and 1930s stands on North 20th Street outside [[Connie Mack Stadium|Shibe Park]], this area replicates the seating similar to that outside [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago. During the 2008 season, fans could go on top for $15 on Thursday home dates and get special food offers and events.\n*'''Starting Lineup (2004-2017)''' \u2014 The Phillies starting lineup that day was illustrated by giant {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} by {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} baseball cards as fans entered the left field gate.\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, organist [[Paul Richardson (organist)|Paul Richardson]] performed from Ashburn Alley, as Citizens Bank Park was built without an organ booth.\n\n[[Image:spectrum panorama.jpg|thumb|center|550px|'''Citizens Bank Park''' (''right'') was the newest of the four locations comprising Philadelphia's \"Sports Complex\" when it opened in 2004; the four-decade-old '''[[Wachovia Spectrum]]''' (''center'') was the oldest (1967) (the arena closed October 31, 2009, and was demolished in 2011); to the left, tree-lined South Broad Street, the world's longest straight street; and the city's expansive skyline along the horizon to the north; in a photograph taken from the roof of the '''[[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]]''', built in 1996.]]\n\n===Other attractions===\n*'''Diamond and Hall of Fame Clubs''' \u2014 Two premium seating areas in the park.

There are a total of 1,164 seats in the Diamond Club. A second level, called the Hall of Fame Club, is located between Sections 212 through 232. This air-conditioned area features exclusive food and souvenir stands akin to The Diamond Club, and also houses memorabilia from the teams' past going back to the 1880s, along with memorabilia from the Philadelphia Athletics. The Hall of Fame Club contains 6,600 seats. In addition to being an attraction to fans, the Hall of Fame level also houses the A/V crew on the first-base side of that level that controls the scoreboard and all other monitors throughout the park and is where [[Dan Baker (PA Announcer)|Dan Baker]] announces the game, as well as the press box, television, and radio booths.\n*'''High and Inside Pub''' \u2014 Located on the Terrace Level behind home plate, the area is open to groups before the ballgame, and the public once the games start.\n*'''Liberty Bell''' \u2014 Standing {{convert|102|ft|m}} above street level, this {{convert|52|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} by {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} mechanical, lighted replica of the [[Liberty Bell]] \"rings\" and lights up after every Phillies home run and victory. In recent years, the Phillies have promoted the [[hashtag]] \"#RingTheBell\".\n*'''New Era Phillies Team Store''' and ''''47 Alley Store''' \u2014 The team store is open year-round, and serves as the starting point for tours of the ballpark. The bi-level store features regular merchandise on the first level and player jerseys as well as Phanatic-themed items on the second level, while the Alley Store is open during all home games and features authentic replicas of older Phillies jerseys made by the famous Philadelphia retailer of vintage uniform shirts and caps, Mitchell and Ness, as well as other items. During the off-season, customizable jerseys are available in the main store when a stand next to the store is open during the season.\n*'''McFadden's Bar and Grille''' \u2014 Open year-round, this restaurant combined the McFadden's and Zanzibar Blue menus at the Third Base Gate. Since its opening, it has become a popular post-game (or event) site for the nearby Wells Fargo Center and Lincoln Financial Field. Closed in 2018.\n*'''Phanatic Phun Zone''' \u2014 Located at the First Base Gate plaza, this playground offers fun for guests eight years old and younger with slides, climb, explore and play games. A separate area for toddlers three years old and younger is found inside.\n*'''Phanatic Giant Shoe Slide''' \u2014 Located on the Terrace Level near home plate, kids could slide in and out of a replica of one of the Phanatic's sneakers. Removed in 2012.\n\n===Statues===\nBesides the Richie Ashburn statue in Ashburn Alley, statues of three other famous Phillies \u2014 [[Robin Roberts (baseball)|Robin Roberts]] (at the First Base Gate), [[Mike Schmidt]] (at the Third Base Gate) and [[Steve Carlton]] (at the Left Field Gate) \u2014 ring the outside of the facility.

Soyuz-MS has minimal external changes with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]], mostly limited to antennas and sensors, as well as the thruster placement.<ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 />\n\nThe first launch was [[Soyuz MS-01]] on July 7, 2016 aboard a [[Soyuz-FG]] [[launch vehicle]] towards the [[International Space Station|ISS]].<ref name=tass-enscience886832 /> The trip included a two-day checkout phase for the design before docking with the ISS on July 9.<ref name=rsw-soyuzms01 />\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Soyuz rocket and spaceship V1-1.svg|alt=Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket|thumb|Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket]]\nA Soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts (from front to back):\n\n* A [[spheroid]] [[orbital module]]\n* A small aerodynamic [[reentry capsule|reentry module]]\n* A cylindrical [[service module]] with solar panels attached\n\nThe first two portions are habitable living space. By moving as much as possible into the orbital module, which does not have to be shielded or decelerated during [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] re-entry, the Soyuz three-part craft is both larger and lighter than the two-part [[Apollo spacecraft]]'s [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]]. The Apollo command module had six cubic meters of living space and a mass of 5000&nbsp;kg; the three-part Soyuz provided the same crew with nine cubic meters of living space, an airlock, and a service module for the mass of the Apollo capsule alone. This does not take into consideration the orbital module that could be used in place of the LEM in Apollo.\n\nSoyuz can carry up to three [[astronaut|cosmonauts]] and provide life support for them for about 30 person-days. The life support system provides a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures. The atmosphere is regenerated through [[KO2|KO<sub>2</sub>]] cylinders, which absorb most of the [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[water]] produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen, and [[LiOH]] cylinders which absorb leftover CO<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe vehicle is protected during launch by a nose fairing, which is jettisoned after passing through the atmosphere. It has an automatic docking system. The ship can be operated automatically, or by a pilot independently of ground control.\n\n=== Orbital Module (BO) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA orbital module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Orbital Module]]\n\nThe forepart of the spacecraft is the orbital module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0431\u044b\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u0411\u041e), ''Bitovoy otsek (BO)'') also known as the Habitation section. It houses all the equipment that will not be needed for reentry, such as experiments, cameras or cargo. Commonly, it is used as both eating area and lavatory. At its far end, it also contains the docking port. This module also contains a toilet, docking avionics and communications gear. On the latest Soyuz versions, a small window was introduced, providing the crew with a forward view.\n\nA hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed with cosmonauts exiting through its side port (at the bottom of this picture, near the descent module). On the launch pad, cosmonauts enter the spacecraft through this port.\n\nThis separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module. The convention of orientation in zero gravity differs from that of the descent module, as cosmonauts stand or sit with their heads to the docking port.\n\n=== Reentry Module (SA) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA descent module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Descent Module]]\nThe reentry module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442 (\u0421\u0410), ''Spuskaemiy apparat (SA)'') is used for launch and the journey back to Earth. It is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during [[re-entry]]. It is slowed initially by the atmosphere, then by a braking parachute, followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing. At one meter above the ground, solid-fuel braking engines mounted behind the [[heat shield]] are fired to give a soft landing. One of the design requirements for the reentry module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency (internal volume divided by hull area). The best shape for this is a sphere, but such a shape can provide no lift, which results in a purely [[ballistic reentry]]. Ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and can't be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn. That is why it was decided to go with the \"headlight\" shape that the Soyuz uses&nbsp;\u2014 a hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled conical section (seven degrees) to a classic spherical section heat shield. This shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution. The nickname was coined at a time when [[Sealed beam|nearly every automobile headlight]] was a circular paraboloid.\n\n=== Service Module (PAO) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA propulsion module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Instrumentation/Propulsion Module]]\nAt the back of the vehicle is the service module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u0410\u041e), ''Priborno-Agregatniy Otsek (PAO)''). It has an instrumentation compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u041e), ''Priborniy Otsek (PO)''), a pressurized container shaped like a bulging can that contains systems for temperature control, electric power supply, long-range [[radio]] communications, radio telemetry, and instruments for orientation and control. The propulsion compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u0410\u041e), ''Agregatniy Otsek (AO)''), a non-pressurized part of the service module, contains the main engine and a spare: liquid-fuel [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion systems]] for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to Earth. The ship also has a system of low-thrust engines for orientation, attached to the intermediate compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u0445\u041e), ''Perekhodnoi Otsek (PkhO)''). Outside the service module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array, which is oriented towards the sun by rotating the ship.\n\n=== Re-entry procedure ===\n\nBecause its modular construction differs from that of previous designs, the Soyuz has an unusual sequence of events prior to re-entry. The spacecraft is turned engine-forward and the main engine is fired for de-orbiting fully 180\u00b0 ahead of its planned landing site. This requires the least propellant for re-entry, the spacecraft traveling on an elliptical [[Hohmann orbit]] to a point where it will be low enough in the atmosphere to re-enter.\n\nEarly Soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously. As they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the descent module, this would aid in their separation and avoid having the descent module alter its orientation. Later Soyuz spacecraft detach the orbital module before firing the main engine, which saves even more propellant, enabling the descent module to return more payload. In no case can the orbital module remain in orbit as an addition to a space station, for the hatch enabling it to function as an airlock is part of the descent module.\n\nRe-entry firing is typically done on the \"dawn\" side of the Earth, so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight, illuminated by the sun when it is above the shadow of the Earth. Since the beginning of Soyuz missions to the ISS, only five have performed nighttime landings.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://spaceflight101.com/iss-expedition-45/soyuz-trio-set-for-rare-nighttime-landing-on-friday/ |title= Soyuz Trio set for rare Nighttime Landing on Friday}}</ref>\n\n== Soyuz MS Improvements ==\n\nThe Soyuz MS received the following upgrades with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]]:<ref name=nsfforum-26410.992797 />\n* The fixed solar panels of the '''SEP''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|C\u042d\u041f, \u0421\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f}}) power supply system have had their [[photovoltaic]] cell efficiency improved to 14% (from 12%) and collective area increased by {{convert|1.1|m2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep />\n* A fifth battery with 155 [[amp-hour]] capacity known as '''906V''' was added to support the increased energy consumption from the improved electronics.\n* Additional micro-meteoroid protective layer was added to the BO orbital module.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep />\n* The new computer ('''TsVM-101'''), weighs one-eighth that of its predecessor (8.3&nbsp;kg vs. 70&nbsp;kg) while also being much smaller than the previous '''Argon-16''' computer.<ref name=nsf-20160706 />\n* While {{as of|2016|7|lc=on}} it is not known whether the propulsion system is still called [[KTDU-80]], it has been significantly modified. While previously the system had 16 high thrust DPO-B and six low thrust DPO-M in one propellant supply circuit, and six other low thrust DPO-M on a different circuit, now all 28 thrusters are high thrust DPO-B, arranged in 14 pairs. Each propellant supply circuit handles 14 DPO-B, with each element of each thruster pair being fed by a different circuit. This provides full fault tolerance for thruster or propellant circuit failure.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu /><ref name=nasajsc-ytvsdklArMnCU /> The new arrangement adds fault tolerance for docking and undocking with one failed thruster or de-orbit with two failed thrusters.<ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 /> Also, the number of DPO-B in the aft section has been doubled to eight, improving the de-orbit fault tolerance.\n* The propellant consumption signal, '''EFIR''' was redesigned to avoid false positives on propellant consumption.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu />\n* The avionics unit, '''BA

It is an evolution of the [[Soyuz TMA-M]] spacecraft, with modernization mostly concentrated on the communications and navigation subsystems.\n\nIt is used by the [[Roscosmos]] for [[human spaceflight]]. Soyuz-MS has minimal external changes with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]], mostly limited to antennas and sensors, as well as the thruster placement.<ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 />\n\nThe first launch was [[Soyuz MS-01]] on July 7, 2016 aboard a [[Soyuz-FG]] [[launch vehicle]] towards the [[International Space Station|ISS]].<ref name=tass-enscience886832 /> The trip included a two-day checkout phase for the design before docking with the ISS on July 9.<ref name=rsw-soyuzms01 />\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Soyuz rocket and spaceship V1-1.svg|alt=Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket|thumb|Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket]]\nA Soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts (from front to back):\n\n* A [[spheroid]] [[orbital module]]\n* A small aerodynamic [[reentry capsule|reentry module]]\n* A cylindrical [[service module]] with solar panels attached\n\nThe first two portions are habitable living space. By moving as much as possible into the orbital module, which does not have to be shielded or decelerated during [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] re-entry, the Soyuz three-part craft is both larger and lighter than the two-part [[Apollo spacecraft]]'s [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]]. The Apollo command module had six cubic meters of living space and a mass of 5000&nbsp;kg; the three-part Soyuz provided the same crew with nine cubic meters of living space, an airlock, and a service module for the mass of the Apollo capsule alone. This does not take into consideration the orbital module that could be used in place of the LEM in Apollo.\n\nSoyuz can carry up to three [[astronaut|cosmonauts]] and provide life support for them for about 30 person-days. The life support system provides a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures. The atmosphere is regenerated through [[KO2|KO<sub>2</sub>]] cylinders, which absorb most of the [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[water]] produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen, and [[LiOH]] cylinders which absorb leftover CO<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe vehicle is protected during launch by a nose fairing, which is jettisoned after passing through the atmosphere. It has an automatic docking system. The ship can be operated automatically, or by a pilot independently of ground control.\n\n=== Orbital Module (BO) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA orbital module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Orbital Module]]\n\nThe forepart of the spacecraft is the orbital module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0431\u044b\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u0411\u041e), ''Bitovoy otsek (BO)'') also known as the Habitation section. It houses all the equipment that will not be needed for reentry, such as experiments, cameras or cargo. Commonly, it is used as both eating area and lavatory. At its far end, it also contains the docking port. This module also contains a toilet, docking avionics and communications gear. On the latest Soyuz versions, a small window was introduced, providing the crew with a forward view.\n\nA hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed with cosmonauts exiting through its side port (at the bottom of this picture, near the descent module). On the launch pad, cosmonauts enter the spacecraft through this port.\n\nThis separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module. The convention of orientation in zero gravity differs from that of the descent module, as cosmonauts stand or sit with their heads to the docking port.\n\n=== Reentry Module (SA) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA descent module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Descent Module]]\nThe reentry module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442 (\u0421\u0410), ''Spuskaemiy apparat (SA)'') is used for launch and the journey back to Earth. It is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during [[re-entry]]. It is slowed initially by the atmosphere, then by a braking parachute, followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing. At one meter above the ground, solid-fuel braking engines mounted behind the [[heat shield]] are fired to give a soft landing. One of the design requirements for the reentry module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency (internal volume divided by hull area). The best shape for this is a sphere, but such a shape can provide no lift, which results in a purely [[ballistic reentry]]. Ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and can't be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn. That is why it was decided to go with the \"headlight\" shape that the Soyuz uses&nbsp;\u2014 a hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled conical section (seven degrees) to a classic spherical section heat shield. This shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution. The nickname was coined at a time when [[Sealed beam|nearly every automobile headlight]] was a circular paraboloid.\n\n=== Service Module (PAO) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA propulsion module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Instrumentation/Propulsion Module]]\nAt the back of the vehicle is the service module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u0410\u041e), ''Priborno-Agregatniy Otsek (PAO)''). It has an instrumentation compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u041e), ''Priborniy Otsek (PO)''), a pressurized container shaped like a bulging can that contains systems for temperature control, electric power supply, long-range [[radio]] communications, radio telemetry, and instruments for orientation and control. The propulsion compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u0410\u041e), ''Agregatniy Otsek (AO)''), a non-pressurized part of the service module, contains the main engine and a spare: liquid-fuel [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion systems]] for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to Earth. The ship also has a system of low-thrust engines for orientation, attached to the intermediate compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u0445\u041e), ''Perekhodnoi Otsek (PkhO)''). Outside the service module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array, which is oriented towards the sun by rotating the ship.\n\n=== Re-entry procedure ===\n\nBecause its modular construction differs from that of previous designs, the Soyuz has an unusual sequence of events prior to re-entry. The spacecraft is turned engine-forward and the main engine is fired for de-orbiting fully 180\u00b0 ahead of its planned landing site. This requires the least propellant for re-entry, the spacecraft traveling on an elliptical [[Hohmann orbit]] to a point where it will be low enough in the atmosphere to re-enter.\n\nEarly Soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously. As they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the descent module, this would aid in their separation and avoid having the descent module alter its orientation. Later Soyuz spacecraft detach the orbital module before firing the main engine, which saves even more propellant, enabling the descent module to return more payload. In no case can the orbital module remain in orbit as an addition to a space station, for the hatch enabling it to function as an airlock is part of the descent module.\n\nRe-entry firing is typically done on the \"dawn\" side of the Earth, so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight, illuminated by the sun when it is above the shadow of the Earth. Since the beginning of Soyuz missions to the ISS, only five have performed nighttime landings.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://spaceflight101.com/iss-expedition-45/soyuz-trio-set-for-rare-nighttime-landing-on-friday/ |title= Soyuz Trio set for rare Nighttime Landing on Friday}}</ref>\n\n== Soyuz MS Improvements ==\n\nThe Soyuz MS received the following upgrades with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]]:<ref name=nsfforum-26410.992797 />\n* The fixed solar panels of the '''SEP''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|C\u042d\u041f, \u0421\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f}}) power supply system have had their [[photovoltaic]] cell efficiency improved to 14% (from 12%) and collective area increased by {{convert|1.1|m2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep />\n* A fifth battery with 155 [[amp-hour]] capacity known as '''906V''' was added to support the increased energy consumption from the improved electronics.\n* Additional micro-meteoroid protective layer was added to the BO orbital module.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep />\n* The new computer ('''TsVM-101'''), weighs one-eighth that of its predecessor (8.3&nbsp;kg vs. 70&nbsp;kg) while also being much smaller than the previous '''Argon-16''' computer.<ref name=nsf-20160706 />\n* While {{as of|2016|7|lc=on}} it is not known whether the propulsion system is still called [[KTDU-80]], it has been significantly modified. While previously the system had 16 high thrust DPO-B and six low thrust DPO-M in one propellant supply circuit, and six other low thrust DPO-M on a different circuit, now all 28 thrusters are high thrust DPO-B, arranged in 14 pairs. Each propellant supply circuit handles 14 DPO-B, with each element of each thruster pair being fed by a different circuit. This provides full fault tolerance for thruster or propellant circuit failure.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu /><ref name=nasajsc-ytvsdklArMnCU /> The new arrangement adds fault tolerance for docking and undocking with one failed thruster or de-orbit with two failed thrusters.<ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 /> Also, the number of DPO-B in the aft section has been doubled to eight, improving the de-orbit fault tolerance.\n* The propellant consumption signal, '''EFIR''' was redesigned to avoid false positives on propellant consumption.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu />\n* The avionics unit, '''BA

[[Iroquois]] people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper [[Ohio River]] basin. The [[American Revolutionary War]] and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the [[eastern United States]] to the [[Indian Territory]] (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the [[Indian removal]] policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape reside in [[Oklahoma]], with some communities living also in [[Wisconsin]], [[Ontario]] (Canada), and in their traditional homelands.\n\nEuropeans came to the [[Delaware Valley]] in the early 17th century, with the first settlements founded by the Dutch, who in 1623 built [[Fort Nassau (South River)|Fort Nassau]] on the Delaware River opposite the [[Schuylkill River]] in what is now [[Brooklawn, New Jersey]]. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their [[New Netherland]] colony. In 1638, [[Sweden|Swedish]] settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of [[New Sweden]] at [[Fort Christina]] (present-day [[Wilmington, Delaware]]) and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the [[Susquehannock]]s in their military defeat of the English colony of [[Maryland]]. In 1648, the Dutch built [[Fort Beversreede]] on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill near the present-day [[Eastwick, Philadelphia|Eastwick]] neighborhood, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building [[New Sweden#Forts|Fort Nya Korsholm]], or New [[Korsholm]], named after a town in [[Finland]] with a Swedish majority. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. The English conquered the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682 when the area was included in [[William Penn]]'s charter for Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, [[Charles II of England]] granted Penn a [[charter]] for what would become the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania colony]]. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony.<ref>{{Cite book\n |last=Brookes\n |first=Karin\n |author2=John Gattuso, Lou Harry, Edward Jardim, Donald Kraybill, Susan Lewis, Dave Nelson and Carol Turkington\n |editor=Zo\u00eb Ross\n |title=Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings\n |edition=Second Edition (Updated)\n |year=2005\n |publisher=APA Publications\n |page=[https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21 21]\n |isbn=1-58573-026-2\n |url=https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21\n }}</ref> Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief [[Tamanend|Tammany]] under an elm tree at [[Shackamaxon]], in what is now the city's [[Fishtown, Philadelphia|Fishtown]] neighborhood.<ref name=weigley>{{Cite book |author          = Weigley RF (eds)\n |title           = Philadelphia: A 300-Year History\n |publisher       = [[W.

Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a [[grid plan]] to keep houses and businesses spread far apart, with areas for gardens and [[orchard]]s. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, as they crowded by the Delaware River port, and subdivided and resold their lots.<ref>''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 7, 14 \u2013 16</ref> Before Penn left Philadelphia for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city.

[[Benjamin Franklin]], a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals.\n\nA number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life: the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|Academy of Natural Sciences]] (1812), and the [[Franklin Institute]] (1824).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=35&chapter=2 |title=Explore PA History website |publisher=Explorepahistory.com |accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> These societies developed and financed new industries, attracting skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.\n\n[[File:1752 ( 1850 ) Scull ^ Heap Map of Philadelphia ^ Environs (first view of Phillidelphia State House) - Geographicus - Philadelphia-sculllobach-1850.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An 18th-century map of Philadelphia, circa 1752]]\nPhiladelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for [[American Revolution|America's revolutionaries]].

The free black community also established many schools for its children, with the help of Quakers. [[New York City]] surpassed Philadelphia in population by 1790.

[[Iroquois]] people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper [[Ohio River]] basin. The [[American Revolutionary War]] and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the [[eastern United States]] to the [[Indian Territory]] (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the [[Indian removal]] policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape reside in [[Oklahoma]], with some communities living also in [[Wisconsin]], [[Ontario]] (Canada), and in their traditional homelands.\n\nEuropeans came to the [[Delaware Valley]] in the early 17th century, with the first settlements founded by the Dutch, who in 1623 built [[Fort Nassau (South River)|Fort Nassau]] on the Delaware River opposite the [[Schuylkill River]] in what is now [[Brooklawn, New Jersey]]. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their [[New Netherland]] colony. In 1638, [[Sweden|Swedish]] settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of [[New Sweden]] at [[Fort Christina]] (present-day [[Wilmington, Delaware]]) and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the [[Susquehannock]]s in their military defeat of the English colony of [[Maryland]]. In 1648, the Dutch built [[Fort Beversreede]] on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill near the present-day [[Eastwick, Philadelphia|Eastwick]] neighborhood, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building [[New Sweden#Forts|Fort Nya Korsholm]], or New [[Korsholm]], named after a town in [[Finland]] with a Swedish majority. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. The English conquered the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682 when the area was included in [[William Penn]]'s charter for Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, [[Charles II of England]] granted Penn a [[charter]] for what would become the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania colony]]. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony.<ref>{{Cite book\n |last=Brookes\n |first=Karin\n |author2=John Gattuso, Lou Harry, Edward Jardim, Donald Kraybill, Susan Lewis, Dave Nelson and Carol Turkington\n |editor=Zo\u00eb Ross\n |title=Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings\n |edition=Second Edition (Updated)\n |year=2005\n |publisher=APA Publications\n |page=[https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21 21]\n |isbn=1-58573-026-2\n |url=https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21\n }}</ref> Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief [[Tamanend|Tammany]] under an elm tree at [[Shackamaxon]], in what is now the city's [[Fishtown, Philadelphia|Fishtown]] neighborhood.<ref name=weigley>{{Cite book |author          = Weigley RF (eds)\n |title           = Philadelphia: A 300-Year History\n |publisher       = [[W.

Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a [[grid plan]] to keep houses and businesses spread far apart, with areas for gardens and [[orchard]]s. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, as they crowded by the Delaware River port, and subdivided and resold their lots.<ref>''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 7, 14 \u2013 16</ref> Before Penn left Philadelphia for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city.

[[Benjamin Franklin]], a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals.\n\nA number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life: the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|Academy of Natural Sciences]] (1812), and the [[Franklin Institute]] (1824).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=35&chapter=2 |title=Explore PA History website |publisher=Explorepahistory.com |accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> These societies developed and financed new industries, attracting skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.\n\n[[File:1752 ( 1850 ) Scull ^ Heap Map of Philadelphia ^ Environs (first view of Phillidelphia State House) - Geographicus - Philadelphia-sculllobach-1850.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An 18th-century map of Philadelphia, circa 1752]]\nPhiladelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for [[American Revolution|America's revolutionaries]].

The free black community also established many schools for its children, with the help of Quakers. [[New York City]] surpassed Philadelphia in population by 1790.

''{{lang|fo|Oyar}}'' represents the plural of ''{{lang|fo|oy}}'', older Faroese for \"island\". Due to sound changes, the modern Faroese word for island is ''oyggj''. The first element, ''{{lang|fo|f\u00f8r}}'', may reflect an Old Norse word ''{{lang|non|f\u00e6r}}'' (sheep), although this analysis is sometimes disputed because Faroese now uses the word ''{{lang|fo|sey\u00f0ur}}'' (from Old Norse ''{{lang|non|sau\u00f0r}}'') to mean \"sheep\". Another possibility is that the Irish monks, who settled the island around 625, had already given the islands a name related to the Gaelic word ''{{lang|ga|fearrann}}'', meaning \"land\" or \"estate\". This name could then have been passed on to the Norwegian settlers, who then added ''{{lang|fo|oyar}}'' (islands).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=f%C3%A6r%C3%B8ske|title=f\u00e6r\u00f8ske \u2014 Den Danske Ordbog|website=ordnet.dk}}</ref> The name thus translates as either \"Islands of Sheep\" or \"Islands of Fearrann\".\n\nIn [[Danish language|Danish]], the name ''{{lang|da|F\u00e6r\u00f8erne}}'' contains the same elements, though ''{{lang|da|\u00f8erne}}'' is the definite plural of ''{{lang|da|\u00f8}}'' (island).\n\nIn English, it may be seen as redundant to say ''the Faroe Islands'', since the ''oe'' comes from an element meaning \"island\". This is seen in the [[BBC]] [[Shipping Forecast]], where the waters around the islands are called ''Faeroes''.

[[Hurricane Faith]] struck the Faroe Islands on 5 September 1966 with sustained winds over 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) and only then did the storm cease to be a tropical system.<ref>GHCN Climate data, Thorshavn series 1881 to 2007</ref>\n\n[[File:Faroe Islands, Eysturoy, Funningsfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur (fjord) in October.jpg|left|thumb|An October evening on [[Eysturoy]]]]\nThe climate varies greatly over small distances, due to the altitude, ocean currents, topography, and winds. Precipitation varies considerably throughout the archipelago. In some highland areas, snow cover may last for months with snowfalls possible for the greater part of the year (on the highest peaks, summer snowfall is by no means rare), while in some sheltered coastal locations, several years pass without any snowfall whatsoever. T\u00f3rshavn receives frosts more often than other areas just a short distance to the south. Snow also is seen at a much higher frequency than on outlying islands nearby.

Although today ''[[s\u00fdsla]]'' technically means \"police district\", the term is still commonly used to indicate a geographical region. In earlier times, each ''s\u00fdsla'' had its own [[Thing (assembly)|assembly]], the so-called ''v\u00e1rting'' (\"spring assembly\").\n\n===Relationship with Denmark===\n{{Multiple issues|{{POV section|date=March 2020}}{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}|section=yes}}\nThe Faroe Islands have been under Norwegian-Danish control since 1388. The 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]] terminated the [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Danish\u2013Norwegian]] union, and Norway came under the rule of the [[King of Sweden]], while the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and [[Greenland]] remained Danish possessions. From ancient times the Faroe Islands had a parliament (''L\u00f8gting''), which was abolished in 1816, and the Faroe Islands were to be governed as an ordinary [[Counties of Denmark|Danish amt]] (county), with the [[Prefect|Amtmand]] as its head of government. In 1851, the ''L\u00f8gting'' was reinstated, but, until 1948, served mainly as an advisory body.\n\nThe islands are home to a notable [[Faroese independence|independence movement]] that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of [[World War II]], some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946, [[1946 Faroese independence referendum|an independence referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote. This was the first time that the Faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence or wanted to continue within the [[Danish kingdom]].\n\n[[File:Queen Margrethe 21-06-2005 V\u00e1gur.jpg|thumb|left|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]], monarch of the [[Unity of the Realm]], during a visit to [[V\u00e1gur]] in 2005]]\nThe result of the vote was a majority in favour of secession. The Speaker of the L\u00f8gting, together with the majority, started the process of becoming a sovereign nation. The minority of the L\u00f8gting left in protest, because they thought these actions were illegal. One parliament member, J\u00e1kup \u00ed J\u00e1kupsstovu, was shunned from his own party, the Social Democratic Party, because he joined the majority of the L\u00f8gting.\n\nThe Speaker of the L\u00f8gting declared the Faroe Islands independent on 18 September 1946.\n\nOn 25 September 1946, a Danish prefect announced to the L\u00f8gting, that the king had dissolved the parliament and wanted new elections, therefore not honoring the wish of the majority.\n\nA parliamentary election was held a few months later, in which the political parties that favoured staying in the Danish kingdom increased their share of the vote and formed a coalition. Based on this, they chose to reject secession. Instead, a compromise was made and the [[Folketing]] passed a home-rule law that went into effect in 1948. The Faroe Islands' status as a Danish ''amt'' was thereby brought to an end; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported by a financial [[subsidy]] from Denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on Danish services.\n\nIn protest to the new Home Rule Act, the Republic Party (Tj\u00f3\u00f0veldi), was founded.\n\nAt present, the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate [[unilateral declaration of independence]]. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the [[Danish nation]]. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, a new draft Faroese constitution is being drawn up. However the draft has been declared by the former [[Danish Prime Minister]], [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]], as incompatible with Denmark's constitution and if the Faroese political parties wish to continue with it, then they must declare independence.<ref>[http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2011/07/06/denmark-and-faroe-islands-in-constitutional-clash/ Denmark and Faroe Islands in constitutional clash], IceNews 6 July 2011</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with the European Union ===\n{{main|Faroe Islands and the European Union}}\nAs explicitly asserted by both [[treaties of the European Union]], the Faroe Islands are not part of the [[European Union]].

Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] (though other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens). The Faroes are not covered by the [[Schengen Agreement]], but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country (the Faroes have been part of the [[Nordic Passport Union]] since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between the Nordic countries and the rest of the [[Schengen Area]] as part of the Schengen agreement).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |title=Implementation of Schengen convention by the prime minister as approved by the L\u00f8gting |publisher=Tinganes.fo |date= |accessdate=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721114619/http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with international organisations===\nThe Faroe Islands are not a fully independent country, but they do have political relations directly with other countries through agreement with Denmark.

Later, when the Vikings colonised the islands, there was a considerable increase in the population. However, it never exceeded 5,000 until the 19th century. Around 1349, about half the population perished in the [[Black Death]] plague.\n\nOnly with the rise of the deep-sea fishery (and thus independence from agriculture in the islands' harsh terrain) and with general progress in the health service was rapid population growth possible in the Faroes. Beginning in the 19th century, the population increased tenfold in 200 years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Faroe Islands entered a deep economic crisis leading to heavy emigration; however, this trend reversed in subsequent years to a net immigration. This has been in the form of a population replacement as young Faroese women leave and are replaced with Asian/Pacific brides.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-24637771|title=Faroe Islands: Men 'must import brides'|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2013}}</ref>\nIn 2011, there were 2,155 more men than women between the age of 0 to 59 in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.fo/news-detail/news/faid-kvinnurnar-heimaftur/|title=F\u00e1i\u00f0 kvinnurnar heimaftur|last=Rana|first=Danjal av|date=22 January 2015|publisher=Sosialurin \u2013 in.fo|language=Faroese|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Faroese population is spread across most of the area; it was not until recent decades that significant urbanisation occurred. Industrialisation has been remarkably decentralised, and the area has therefore maintained quite a viable rural culture. Nevertheless, villages with poor harbour facilities have been the losers in the development from agriculture to fishing, and in the most peripheral agricultural areas, also known as [[\u00datoyggjar]] \"Outer Islands\", there are few young people. In recent decades, the village-based social structure has nevertheless been placed under pressure, giving way to a rise in interconnected \"centres\" that are better able to provide goods and services than the badly connected periphery. This means that shops and services are now relocating en masse from the villages into the centres, and slowly but steadily the Faroese population is concentrating in and around the centres.\n\nIn the 1990s, the government abandoned the old national policy of developing the villages (Bygdamenning), and instead began a process of regional development (\u00d8kismenning). The term \"region\" referred to the large islands of the Faroes. Nevertheless, the government was unable to press through the structural reform of merging small rural municipalities to create sustainable, decentralised entities that could drive forward regional development. As regional development has been difficult on the administrative level, the government has instead invested heavily in infrastructure, interconnecting the regions.\n\nIn general, it is becoming less valid to regard the Faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions. The huge investments in roads, bridges and sub-sea tunnels (see also [[Transport in the Faroe Islands]]) have bound the islands together, creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90% of the population. From this perspective it is reasonable to regard the Faroes as a dispersed city or even to refer to it as the ''Faroese Network City''.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[File:Faroe stamp 048 europe (v u hammershaimb).jpg|thumb|upright|A stamp commemorating [[V.

It is difficult to say exactly how many people worldwide speak the Faroese language, because many ethnic Faroese live in Denmark, and few who are born there return to the Faroes with their parents or as adults.\n\nFaroese belongs to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] branch of [[Indo-European languages]]. Written Faroese (grammar and vocabulary) is most similar to [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and to their ancestor [[Old Norse]], though the spoken language is closer to [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] dialects of [[Western Norway]]. Faroese is the first official language of the island while [[Danish language|Danish]], the second, is taught in schools and can be used by the Faroese government in public relations.<ref name=\"folang\"/>\n\nFaroese language policy provides for the active creation of new terms in Faroese suitable for modern life.\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Religion in the Faroe Islands}}\nAccording to the ''[[F\u00e6reyinga saga]]'', [[Sigmundur Brestisson]] brought Christianity to the islands in 999.

According to official statistics from 2019, 79.7% of the Faroese population are members of the state church, the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] (F\u00f3lkakirkjan), a form of [[Lutheranism]].<ref>[https://statbank.hagstova.fo/pxweb/en/H2/H2__MM__MM03/atrud_prgj.px/ Parishes, 1st January (2000-2019)] Statistics Faroe Islands</ref> The F\u00f3lkakirkjan became an independent church in 2007; previously it had been a diocese within the [[Church of Denmark]]. Faroese members of the clergy who have had historical importance include [[Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb]] (1819\u20131909), [[Fr\u00ed\u00f0rikur Petersen]] (1853\u20131917) and, perhaps most significantly, [[J\u00e1kup Dahl]] (1878\u20131944), who had a great influence in ensuring that the [[Faroese language]] was spoken in the church instead of [[Danish language|Danish]]. Participation in churches is more prevalent among the Faroese population than among most other Scandinavians.\n\nIn the late 1820s, the Christian [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] religious movement, the [[Plymouth Brethren]], was established in England. In 1865, a member of this movement, [[William Gibson Sloan]], travelled to the Faroes from [[Shetland]]. At the turn of the 20th century, the Faroese Plymouth Brethren numbered thirty. Today, around 10% of the Faroese population are members of the Open Brethren community (''Br\u00f8\u00f0rasamkoman''). About 3% belong to the [[Charismatic Movement]]. There are several charismatic churches around the islands, the largest of which, called Keldan (The Spring), has about 200 to 300 members. About 2% belong to other Christian groups. The [[Adventism|Adventists]] operate a private school in T\u00f3rshavn. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] also have four congregations with a total of 121 members. The Roman Catholic congregation has about 170 members and falls under the jurisdiction of Denmark's [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen]]. The municipality of [[T\u00f3rshavn]] has an old [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] school.\n[[File:Kunoy, Faroe Islands (2).JPG|thumb|Church in [[Kunoy]]]]\n\nThere are also around fifteen [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] who meet at four different places. The [[Ahmadiyya]]s established a community in the Faroe Islands in 2010. Unlike [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Iceland]] with [[Heathenry (new religious movement)#Forn Si\u00f0r|Forn Si\u00f0r]], the Faroes have no organised Heathen community.\n\nThe best-known church buildings in the Faroe Islands include [[T\u00f3rshavn Cathedral]], [[Olaf II of Norway]]'s Church and the [[Magnus Cathedral]] in [[Kirkjub\u00f8ur]]; the Vesturkirkjan and the Maria Church, both of which are situated in T\u00f3rshavn; the church of [[F\u00e1mjin]]; the octagonal church in [[Hald\u00f3rsv\u00edk]]; Christianskirkjan in [[Klaksv\u00edk]]; and also the two pictured here.\n\nIn 1948, Victor Danielsen (Plymouth Brethren) completed the first Bible translation into Faroese from different modern languages. Jacob Dahl and Kristian Osvald Vider\u00f8 (F\u00f3lkakirkjan) completed the second translation in 1961. The latter was translated from the original Biblical languages ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) into Faroese.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, there were 33,018 Christians (95.44%), 23 Muslims (0.07%), 7 [[Hindu]]s (0.02%), 66 [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (0.19%), 12 [[Jews]] (0.03%), 13 Baha'i (0.04%), 3 [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (0.01%), 149 others (0.43%), 85 with more than one belief (0.25%), and 1,397 with no religion (4.04%).<ref>{{cite web|title=CS 10.1.2 Population by religious faith, educational attainment, occupation, country of birth, year of arrival in the country and place of usual residence.|url=http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|website=Statistics Faroe Islands|accessdate=1 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002070910/http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|archive-date=2 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\n{{main|Education in the Faroe Islands}}\nThe levels of education in the Faroe Islands are [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher]] education.

Students that complete compulsory education are allowed to continue education in a [[vocational school]], where they can have job-specific training and education. Since the fishing industry is an important part of [[Economy of the Faroe Islands|country's economy]], maritime schools are an important part of Faroese education. Upon completion of the tenth year of F\u00f3lkask\u00fali, students can continue to upper secondary education which consists of several different types of schools. Higher education is offered at the [[University of the Faroe Islands]]; a part of Faroese youth moves abroad to pursue higher education, mainly in [[Denmark]].

The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is [[Faroese language|Faroese]], which is one of three insular [[North Germanic languages]] descended from the [[Old Norse]] language spoken in Scandinavia in the [[Viking Age]], the others being [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the extinct [[Norn language|Norn]], which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling [[Norway|Norwegians]] outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. Although a rich spoken tradition survived, for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), \u00e6vint\u00fdr (stories) and [[kv\u00e6\u00f0i]] (ballads), often set to music and the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chain dance. These were eventually written down in the 19th century.\n\n===Faroese literature===\n{{main|Faroese literature}}\n[[File:Faroe stamp 364 rasmussen and skardi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0|Rasmus Rasmussen]], the writer who wrote the first novel in the [[Faroese language]] (poetical name: Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0) and [[S\u00edmun av Skar\u00f0i]], the poet who wrote the Faroese national hymn]]\nFaroese written literature has only really developed in the past 100\u2013200 years. This is mainly because of the islands' isolation, and also because the [[Faroese language]] was not written down in a standardised format until 1890. The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. A rich centuries-old oral tradition of folk tales and Faroese folk songs accompanied the [[Faroese dance|Faroese chain dance]]. The people learned these songs and stories by heart, and told or sang them to each other, teaching the younger generations too. This kind of literature was gathered in the 19th century and early 20th century. The Faroese folk songs, in Faroese called ''kv\u00e6\u00f0i'', are still in use although not so large-scale as earlier. Some of the Faroese folk songs have been used by the Faroese Viking metal band [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], i.e., ''[[Ormurin Langi]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ormurin-Langi/dp/B0042GGCG4 |title=Ormurin Langi: T\u00fdr: MP3 Downloads |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[List of novels written in Faroese|Faroese novel]], ''B\u00e1belstorni\u00f0'' by [[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0]], was published in 1909; the second novel was published 18 years later.

Some of these writers have been nominated for the [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] two to six times, but have never won it.

[[B\u00e1r\u00f0ur Oskarsson]] (born 1972) is a children's book writer and illustrator; his books won prizes in the Faroes, Germany and the [[West Nordic Council's Children and Youth Literature Prize]] (2006). Though not born in the Faroe Islands, Matthew Landrum an American poet and editor for the Structo magazine, has written a collection of poems about the Islands.

Multiple Danish Music Award winner [[Teitur Lassen]] calls the Faroes home and is arguably the islands' most internationally well-known musical export.\n\nThe Islands have their own [[orchestra]] (the classical ensemble ''Aldub\u00e1ran'') and many different choirs; the best-known of these is ''Havnark\u00f3ri\u00f0''. The best-known local Faroese composers are [[Sunleif Rasmussen]] and [[Kristian Blak]], who is also head of the record company [[Tutl]]. The first Faroese opera was by Sunleif Rasmussen. It is entitled ''\u00cd \u00d3\u00f0amansgar\u00f0i'' (The Madman's Garden) and was premiered on 12 October 2006 at the Nordic House. The opera is based on a short story by the writer [[William Heinesen]].\n\nYoung Faroese musicians who have gained much popularity recently are [[Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir]], Anna Katrin Egilstr\u00f8\u00f0, Lena (Lena Andersen), [[H\u00f8gni Reistrup]], [[H\u00f8gni Lisberg]], HEI\u00d0RIK ([[Hei\u00f0rik \u00e1 Heygum]]), [[Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Hansd\u00f3ttir]] and [[Brandur Enni]].\n\nWell-known bands include [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], Gestir, [[Hamfer\u00f0]], [[The Ghost (Faroese band)|The Ghost]], [[Boys in a Band]], ORKA, [[:fo:200 (rokkb\u00f3lkur)|200]], Grandma's Basement, [[Sic (band)|SIC]], and the former band Clickhaze.\n\nThe festival of contemporary and classical music, ''Summart\u00f3nar'', is held each summer. The [[G! Festival]] in [[Nor\u00f0rag\u00f8ta]] in July and [[Summarfestivalurin]] in [[Klaksv\u00edk]] in August are both large, open-air music festivals for popular music with both local and international musicians participating. Havnar Jazzfelag was established 21 November 1975, and is still active. Currently Havnar Jazzfelag is arranging VetrarJazz amongst other jazz-festivals in The Faroe Islands.\n\n===The Nordic House in the Faroe Islands===\nThe [[Nordic House in the Faroe Islands]] ({{lang-fo|Nor\u00f0urlandah\u00fasi\u00f0}}) is the most important cultural institution in the Faroes. Its aim is to support and promote [[Scandinavia]]n and Faroese culture, locally and in the Nordic region. [[Erlendur Patursson]] (1913\u201386), Faroese member of the [[Nordic Council]], raised the idea of a Nordic cultural house in the Faroe Islands. A Nordic competition for architects was held in 1977, in which 158 architects participated. Winners were Ola Steen from [[Norway]] and Kolbr\u00fan Ragnarsd\u00f3ttir from [[Iceland]]. By staying true to [[folklore]], the architects built the Nordic House to resemble an enchanted hill of [[elf|elves]]. The house opened in [[T\u00f3rshavn]] in 1983. The Nordic House is a cultural organization under the Nordic Council. The Nordic House is run by a steering committee of eight, of whom three are Faroese and five from other Nordic countries. There is also a local advisory body of fifteen members, representing Faroese cultural organizations. The House is managed by a director appointed by the steering committee for a four-year term.\n\n===Traditional food===\n{{main|Faroese cuisine}}\nTraditional Faroese food is mainly based on meat, seafood and potatoes and uses few fresh vegetables. Mutton of the [[Faroe sheep]] is the basis of many meals, and one of the most popular treats is ''[[skerpikj\u00f8t]]'', well aged, wind-dried mutton, which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a ''hjallur'', is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are ''r\u00e6st kj\u00f8t'' (semi-dried mutton) and ''r\u00e6stur fiskur'', matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is ''[[tv\u00f8st og spik]]'', made from [[pilot whale]] meat and [[blubber]]. (A parallel meat/fat dish made with [[offal]] is ''[[garnat\u00e1lg]]''.) The tradition of consuming meat and blubber from pilot whales arises from the fact that a single kill can provide many meals. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do [[seabird]]s, such as [[Faroese puffin]]s, and their eggs. Dried fish is also commonly eaten.\n[[File:Dog as truck driver.jpg|thumb|right|Truck delivering [[Cadbury]] chocolate in the Faroe Islands]]\nThere are two breweries in the Faroe Islands. The first brewery is called [[F\u00f6roya Bj\u00f3r]] and has produced beer since 1888 with exports mainly to Iceland and Denmark. The second brewery is called Okkara Bryggjar\u00ed and was founded in 2010. A local specialty is ''fredrikk'', a special brew made in [[N\u00f3lsoy]]. Production of hard alcohol such as [[snaps]] is forbidden in the Faroe Islands, hence the Faroese [[akvavit]] is produced abroad.\n\nSince the friendly British occupation, the Faroese have been fond of British food, in particular [[fish and chips]] and British-style chocolate such as [[Cadbury Dairy Milk]], which is found in many of the island's shops.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nordic holiday ideas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/sep/02/scandinavia-holidays-sweden-lapland |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2011|last = Dixon|first = Rachel}}</ref>\n\n===Whaling===\n{{main|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Whaling in the Faroe Islands in August 2012.JPG|thumb|Boats driving a pod of pilot whales into a bay of [[Su\u00f0uroy]] in 2012]]\nThere are records of drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584.<ref>{{cite book |first=Philippa |last=Brakes |chapter=A background to whaling |year=2004 |editor=Philippa Brakes |editor2=Andrew Butterworth |editor3=Mark Simmonds |editor4=Philip Lymbery |title=Troubled Waters: A Review of the Welfare Implications of Modern Whaling Activities |isbn=0-9547065-0-1 |page=7 |chapter-url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/troubledwaters.pdf}}</ref> [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands]] is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the [[International Whaling Commission]] as there are disagreements about the Commission's legal authority to regulate [[cetacea]]n hunts. Hundreds of [[long-finned pilot whale]]s (''Globicephala melaena'') could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called ''grindadr\u00e1p'' in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay.<ref name=\"Home\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/en/home/|title=Home|publisher=}}</ref> When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun.\n\nFaroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the [[spinal cord]], which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and has been shown to reduce killing time to 1\u20132 seconds.<ref name=\"Home\"/>\n\nThis \"grindadr\u00e1p\" is legal and provides food for many people in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm#Drivingthewhales |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324072829/http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm |title=Whales and whaling in the Faroe Islands |publisher=Faroese Government |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=24 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031231236/http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |title=Why do whales and dolphins strand? |publisher=[[WDCS]] |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=31 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nicole|last=Chrismar|date=28 July 2006|title=Dolphins Hunted for Sport and Fertilizer|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2248161&page=1|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> However, a study has found whale meat and blubber to currently be contaminated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and not recommended for human consumption, as too much may cause such adverse health effects as birth defects of the nervous system, high blood pressure, damaged immune system, increased risk for developing [[Parkinson's disease]], [[hypertension]], [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]:\n{{quote|Therefore we recommend that adults eat no more than one to two meals a month.

Many young people study and move abroad, and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific Faroese heritage.\n\nThere has also been a great interest in Faroese [[sweater]]s<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/sarah-lund-jumper-copyright-the-killing|title=Sarah Lund's jumper is exhibit A in a legal battle|first=Mark|last=Townsend|date=9 August 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> from the TV series ''[[The Killing (Danish TV series)|The Killing]]'', where the main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by [[Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l]]) wears Faroese sweaters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9533226/Fans-of-The-Killing-can-now-knit-their-own-Sarah-Lund-jumper.html|title=Fans of 'The Killing' can now knit their own Sarah Lund jumper|last=Hall|first=James|date=2012-09-10|access-date=2020-01-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n[[Lace knitting]] is a traditional handicraft. The most distinctive trait of [[Faroese lace shawls]] is the centre-back [[gusset]] shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping. These are worn by all generations of women, particularly as part of the traditional Faroese costume as an overgarment.\n\n[[File:Faroese folk dance club from vagar.jpg|thumb|left|Faroese folk dancers, some of them in national costume]]\nThe traditional Faroese national dress is also a local handicraft that people spend a lot of time, money, and effort to assemble. It is worn at weddings and traditional dancing events, and on feast days. The cultural significance of the garment should not be underestimated, both as an expression of local and national identity and a passing on and reinforcing of traditional skills that bind local communities together.\n\nA young Faroese person is normally handed down a set of children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are [[confirmed]] at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage. Traditionally the aim would have been to complete the outfit by the time a young person was ready to marry and wear the clothes at the ceremony\u2014though it is mainly only men who do this now.\n\nEach piece is intricately hand-knitted, dyed, woven or embroidered to the specifications of the wearer. For example, the man's waistcoat is put together by hand in bright blue, red or black fine wool. The front is then intricately embroidered with colourful silk threads, often by a female relative. The motifs are often local Faroese flowers or herbs. After this, a row of Faroese-made solid silver buttons are sewn on the outfit.\n\nWomen wear embroidered silk, cotton or wool shawls and pinafores that can take months to weave or embroider with local flora and fauna. They are also adorned with a handwoven black and red ankle-length skirt, knitted black and red jumper, a velvet belt, and black 18th century style shoes with silver buckles. The outfit is held together by a row of solid silver buttons, silver chains and locally-made silver brooches and belt buckles, often fashioned with Viking style motifs.\n\nBoth men's and women's national dress are extremely costly and can take many years to assemble. Women in the family often work together to assemble the outfits, including knitting the close-fitting jumpers, weaving and embroidering, sewing and assembling the national dress.\n\nThis tradition binds together families, passes on traditional crafts, and reinforces the Faroese culture of traditional village life in the context of a modern society.\n\n===Public holidays===\n[[File:F\u00f8roysk fl\u00f8gg \u00e1 \u00d3lavs\u00f8ku.jpg|thumb|The annual ''\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka'' parade on 28 July 2005.]]\n{{see also|Public holidays in Denmark}}\n''[[\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka]]'' is on 29 July; it commemorates the death of [[Saint Olaf]].

''{{lang|fo|Oyar}}'' represents the plural of ''{{lang|fo|oy}}'', older Faroese for \"island\". Due to sound changes, the modern Faroese word for island is ''oyggj''. The first element, ''{{lang|fo|f\u00f8r}}'', may reflect an Old Norse word ''{{lang|non|f\u00e6r}}'' (sheep), although this analysis is sometimes disputed because Faroese now uses the word ''{{lang|fo|sey\u00f0ur}}'' (from Old Norse ''{{lang|non|sau\u00f0r}}'') to mean \"sheep\". Another possibility is that the Irish monks, who settled the island around 625, had already given the islands a name related to the Gaelic word ''{{lang|ga|fearrann}}'', meaning \"land\" or \"estate\". This name could then have been passed on to the Norwegian settlers, who then added ''{{lang|fo|oyar}}'' (islands).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=f%C3%A6r%C3%B8ske|title=f\u00e6r\u00f8ske \u2014 Den Danske Ordbog|website=ordnet.dk}}</ref> The name thus translates as either \"Islands of Sheep\" or \"Islands of Fearrann\".\n\nIn [[Danish language|Danish]], the name ''{{lang|da|F\u00e6r\u00f8erne}}'' contains the same elements, though ''{{lang|da|\u00f8erne}}'' is the definite plural of ''{{lang|da|\u00f8}}'' (island).\n\nIn English, it may be seen as redundant to say ''the Faroe Islands'', since the ''oe'' comes from an element meaning \"island\". This is seen in the [[BBC]] [[Shipping Forecast]], where the waters around the islands are called ''Faeroes''. The name is also sometimes spelled \"Faeroe\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Faroe Islands|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faroe+islands|website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Faeroe Islands|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Faeroe%20Islands|website=[[Dictionary.com]]|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Faroe Islands}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2014}}\n\nArchaeological evidence shows settlers living on the Faroe Islands in two successive periods before the Norse arrived, the first between 300 and 600 AD and the second between 600 and 800 AD.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Church | first1 = M.

Norwegian control of the Faroes continued until 1814, although, when the [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)]] entered the [[Kalmar Union]] with Denmark, it gradually resulted in Danish control of the islands.

The overall character of the climate of the islands is influenced by the strong warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean, which produces the [[North Atlantic Current]]. This, together with the remoteness of any source of landmass-induced warm or cold airflows, ensures that winters are mild (mean temperature 3.0 to 4.0&nbsp;\u00b0C or 37 to 39&nbsp;\u00b0F) while summers are cool (mean temperature 9.5 to 10.5&nbsp;\u00b0C or 49 to 51&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nThe islands are windy, cloudy, and cool throughout the year with an average of 210 rainy or snowy days per year. The islands lie in the path of depressions moving northeast, making strong winds and heavy rain possible at all times of the year. Sunny days are rare and overcast days are common. [[Hurricane Faith]] struck the Faroe Islands on 5 September 1966 with sustained winds over 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) and only then did the storm cease to be a tropical system.<ref>GHCN Climate data, Thorshavn series 1881 to 2007</ref>\n\n[[File:Faroe Islands, Eysturoy, Funningsfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur (fjord) in October.jpg|left|thumb|An October evening on [[Eysturoy]]]]\nThe climate varies greatly over small distances, due to the altitude, ocean currents, topography, and winds. Precipitation varies considerably throughout the archipelago. In some highland areas, snow cover may last for months with snowfalls possible for the greater part of the year (on the highest peaks, summer snowfall is by no means rare), while in some sheltered coastal locations, several years pass without any snowfall whatsoever. T\u00f3rshavn receives frosts more often than other areas just a short distance to the south. Snow also is seen at a much higher frequency than on outlying islands nearby.

The 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]] terminated the [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Danish\u2013Norwegian]] union, and Norway came under the rule of the [[King of Sweden]], while the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and [[Greenland]] remained Danish possessions. From ancient times the Faroe Islands had a parliament (''L\u00f8gting''), which was abolished in 1816, and the Faroe Islands were to be governed as an ordinary [[Counties of Denmark|Danish amt]] (county), with the [[Prefect|Amtmand]] as its head of government. In 1851, the ''L\u00f8gting'' was reinstated, but, until 1948, served mainly as an advisory body.\n\nThe islands are home to a notable [[Faroese independence|independence movement]] that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of [[World War II]], some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946, [[1946 Faroese independence referendum|an independence referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote. This was the first time that the Faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence or wanted to continue within the [[Danish kingdom]].\n\n[[File:Queen Margrethe 21-06-2005 V\u00e1gur.jpg|thumb|left|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]], monarch of the [[Unity of the Realm]], during a visit to [[V\u00e1gur]] in 2005]]\nThe result of the vote was a majority in favour of secession. The Speaker of the L\u00f8gting, together with the majority, started the process of becoming a sovereign nation. The minority of the L\u00f8gting left in protest, because they thought these actions were illegal. One parliament member, J\u00e1kup \u00ed J\u00e1kupsstovu, was shunned from his own party, the Social Democratic Party, because he joined the majority of the L\u00f8gting.\n\nThe Speaker of the L\u00f8gting declared the Faroe Islands independent on 18 September 1946.\n\nOn 25 September 1946, a Danish prefect announced to the L\u00f8gting, that the king had dissolved the parliament and wanted new elections, therefore not honoring the wish of the majority.\n\nA parliamentary election was held a few months later, in which the political parties that favoured staying in the Danish kingdom increased their share of the vote and formed a coalition. Based on this, they chose to reject secession. Instead, a compromise was made and the [[Folketing]] passed a home-rule law that went into effect in 1948. The Faroe Islands' status as a Danish ''amt'' was thereby brought to an end; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported by a financial [[subsidy]] from Denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on Danish services.\n\nIn protest to the new Home Rule Act, the Republic Party (Tj\u00f3\u00f0veldi), was founded.\n\nAt present, the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate [[unilateral declaration of independence]]. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the [[Danish nation]]. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, a new draft Faroese constitution is being drawn up. However the draft has been declared by the former [[Danish Prime Minister]], [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]], as incompatible with Denmark's constitution and if the Faroese political parties wish to continue with it, then they must declare independence.<ref>[http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2011/07/06/denmark-and-faroe-islands-in-constitutional-clash/ Denmark and Faroe Islands in constitutional clash], IceNews 6 July 2011</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with the European Union ===\n{{main|Faroe Islands and the European Union}}\nAs explicitly asserted by both [[treaties of the European Union]], the Faroe Islands are not part of the [[European Union]].

The Faroes are not covered by the [[Schengen Agreement]], but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country (the Faroes have been part of the [[Nordic Passport Union]] since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between the Nordic countries and the rest of the [[Schengen Area]] as part of the Schengen agreement).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |title=Implementation of Schengen convention by the prime minister as approved by the L\u00f8gting |publisher=Tinganes.fo |date= |accessdate=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721114619/http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with international organisations ===\nThe Faroe Islands are not a fully independent country, but they do have political relations directly with other countries through agreement with Denmark.

Later, when the Vikings colonised the islands, there was a considerable increase in the population. However, it never exceeded 5,000 until the 19th century. Around 1349, about half the population perished in the [[Black Death]] plague.\n\nOnly with the rise of the deep-sea fishery (and thus independence from agriculture in the islands' harsh terrain) and with general progress in the health service was rapid population growth possible in the Faroes. Beginning in the 19th century, the population increased tenfold in 200 years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Faroe Islands entered a deep economic crisis leading to heavy emigration; however, this trend reversed in subsequent years to a net immigration. This has been in the form of a population replacement as young Faroese women leave and are replaced with Asian/Pacific brides.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-24637771|title=Faroe Islands: Men 'must import brides'|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2013}}</ref>\nIn 2011, there were 2,155 more men than women between the age of 0 to 59 in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.fo/news-detail/news/faid-kvinnurnar-heimaftur/|title=F\u00e1i\u00f0 kvinnurnar heimaftur|last=Rana|first=Danjal av|date=22 January 2015|publisher=Sosialurin \u2013 in.fo|language=Faroese|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Faroese population is spread across most of the area; it was not until recent decades that significant urbanisation occurred. Industrialisation has been remarkably decentralised, and the area has therefore maintained quite a viable rural culture. Nevertheless, villages with poor harbour facilities have been the losers in the development from agriculture to fishing, and in the most peripheral agricultural areas, also known as [[\u00datoyggjar]] \"Outer Islands\", there are few young people. In recent decades, the village-based social structure has nevertheless been placed under pressure, giving way to a rise in interconnected \"centres\" that are better able to provide goods and services than the badly connected periphery. This means that shops and services are now relocating en masse from the villages into the centres, and slowly but steadily the Faroese population is concentrating in and around the centres.\n\nIn the 1990s, the government abandoned the old national policy of developing the villages (Bygdamenning), and instead began a process of regional development (\u00d8kismenning). The term \"region\" referred to the large islands of the Faroes. Nevertheless, the government was unable to press through the structural reform of merging small rural municipalities to create sustainable, decentralised entities that could drive forward regional development. As regional development has been difficult on the administrative level, the government has instead invested heavily in infrastructure, interconnecting the regions.\n\nIn general, it is becoming less valid to regard the Faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions. The huge investments in roads, bridges and sub-sea tunnels (see also [[Transport in the Faroe Islands]]) have bound the islands together, creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90% of the population. From this perspective it is reasonable to regard the Faroes as a dispersed city or even to refer to it as the ''Faroese Network City''.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[File:Faroe stamp 048 europe (v u hammershaimb).jpg|thumb|upright|A stamp commemorating [[V.

In 1865, a member of this movement, [[William Gibson Sloan]], travelled to the Faroes from [[Shetland]]. At the turn of the 20th century, the Faroese Plymouth Brethren numbered thirty. Today, around 10% of the Faroese population are members of the Open Brethren community (''Br\u00f8\u00f0rasamkoman''). About 3% belong to the [[Charismatic Movement]]. There are several charismatic churches around the islands, the largest of which, called Keldan (The Spring), has about 200 to 300 members. About 2% belong to other Christian groups. The [[Adventism|Adventists]] operate a private school in T\u00f3rshavn. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] also have four congregations with a total of 121 members. The Roman Catholic congregation has about 170 members and falls under the jurisdiction of Denmark's [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen]]. The municipality of [[T\u00f3rshavn]] has an old [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] school.\n[[File:Kunoy, Faroe Islands (2).JPG|thumb|Church in [[Kunoy]]]]\n\nThere are also around fifteen [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] who meet at four different places. The [[Ahmadiyya]]s established a community in the Faroe Islands in 2010. Unlike [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Iceland]] with [[Heathenry (new religious movement)#Forn Si\u00f0r|Forn Si\u00f0r]], the Faroes have no organised Heathen community.\n\nThe best-known church buildings in the Faroe Islands include [[T\u00f3rshavn Cathedral]], [[Olaf II of Norway]]'s Church and the [[Magnus Cathedral]] in [[Kirkjub\u00f8ur]]; the Vesturkirkjan and the Maria Church, both of which are situated in T\u00f3rshavn; the church of [[F\u00e1mjin]]; the octagonal church in [[Hald\u00f3rsv\u00edk]]; Christianskirkjan in [[Klaksv\u00edk]]; and also the two pictured here.\n\nIn 1948, Victor Danielsen (Plymouth Brethren) completed the first Bible translation into Faroese from different modern languages. Jacob Dahl and Kristian Osvald Vider\u00f8 (F\u00f3lkakirkjan) completed the second translation in 1961. The latter was translated from the original Biblical languages ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) into Faroese.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, there were 33,018 Christians (95.44%), 23 Muslims (0.07%), 7 [[Hindu]]s (0.02%), 66 [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (0.19%), 12 [[Jews]] (0.03%), 13 Baha'i (0.04%), 3 [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (0.01%), 149 others (0.43%), 85 with more than one belief (0.25%), and 1,397 with no religion (4.04%).<ref>{{cite web|title=CS 10.1.2 Population by religious faith, educational attainment, occupation, country of birth, year of arrival in the country and place of usual residence.|url=http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|website=Statistics Faroe Islands|accessdate=1 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002070910/http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|archive-date=2 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\n{{main|Education in the Faroe Islands}}\nThe levels of education in the Faroe Islands are [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher]] education.

The F\u00f3lkask\u00fali also provides optional preschool education as well as the tenth year of education that is a prerequisite to get admitted to upper secondary education. Students that complete compulsory education are allowed to continue education in a [[vocational school]], where they can have job-specific training and education. Since the fishing industry is an important part of [[Economy of the Faroe Islands|country's economy]], maritime schools are an important part of Faroese education. Upon completion of the tenth year of F\u00f3lkask\u00fali, students can continue to upper secondary education which consists of several different types of schools. Higher education is offered at the [[University of the Faroe Islands]]; a part of Faroese youth moves abroad to pursue higher education, mainly in [[Denmark]]. Other forms of education comprise [[adult education]] and music schools.

The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is [[Faroese language|Faroese]], which is one of three insular [[North Germanic languages]] descended from the [[Old Norse]] language spoken in Scandinavia in the [[Viking Age]], the others being [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the extinct [[Norn language|Norn]], which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling [[Norway|Norwegians]] outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. Although a rich spoken tradition survived, for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), \u00e6vint\u00fdr (stories) and [[kv\u00e6\u00f0i]] (ballads), often set to music and the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chain dance. These were eventually written down in the 19th century.\n\n===Faroese literature===\n{{main|Faroese literature}}\n[[File:Faroe stamp 364 rasmussen and skardi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0|Rasmus Rasmussen]], the writer who wrote the first novel in the [[Faroese language]] (poetical name: Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0) and [[S\u00edmun av Skar\u00f0i]], the poet who wrote the Faroese national hymn]]\nFaroese written literature has only really developed in the past 100\u2013200 years. This is mainly because of the islands' isolation, and also because the [[Faroese language]] was not written down in a standardised format until 1890. The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. A rich centuries-old oral tradition of folk tales and Faroese folk songs accompanied the [[Faroese dance|Faroese chain dance]]. The people learned these songs and stories by heart, and told or sang them to each other, teaching the younger generations too. This kind of literature was gathered in the 19th century and early 20th century. The Faroese folk songs, in Faroese called ''kv\u00e6\u00f0i'', are still in use although not so large-scale as earlier.

Multiple Danish Music Award winner [[Teitur Lassen]] calls the Faroes home and is arguably the islands' most internationally well-known musical export.\n\nThe Islands have their own [[orchestra]] (the classical ensemble ''Aldub\u00e1ran'') and many different choirs; the best-known of these is ''Havnark\u00f3ri\u00f0''. The best-known local Faroese composers are [[Sunleif Rasmussen]] and [[Kristian Blak]], who is also head of the record company [[Tutl]]. The first Faroese opera was by Sunleif Rasmussen. It is entitled ''\u00cd \u00d3\u00f0amansgar\u00f0i'' (The Madman's Garden) and was premiered on 12 October 2006 at the Nordic House. The opera is based on a short story by the writer [[William Heinesen]].\n\nYoung Faroese musicians who have gained much popularity recently are [[Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir]], Anna Katrin Egilstr\u00f8\u00f0, Lena (Lena Andersen), [[H\u00f8gni Reistrup]], [[H\u00f8gni Lisberg]], HEI\u00d0RIK ([[Hei\u00f0rik \u00e1 Heygum]]), [[Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Hansd\u00f3ttir]] and [[Brandur Enni]].\n\nWell-known bands include [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], Gestir, [[Hamfer\u00f0]], [[The Ghost (Faroese band)|The Ghost]], [[Boys in a Band]], ORKA, [[:fo:200 (rokkb\u00f3lkur)|200]], Grandma's Basement, [[Sic (band)|SIC]], and the former band Clickhaze.\n\nThe festival of contemporary and classical music, ''Summart\u00f3nar'', is held each summer. The [[G! Festival]] in [[Nor\u00f0rag\u00f8ta]] in July and [[Summarfestivalurin]] in [[Klaksv\u00edk]] in August are both large, open-air music festivals for popular music with both local and international musicians participating. Havnar Jazzfelag was established 21 November 1975, and is still active. Currently Havnar Jazzfelag is arranging VetrarJazz amongst other jazz-festivals in The Faroe Islands.\n\n===The Nordic House in the Faroe Islands===\nThe [[Nordic House in the Faroe Islands]] ({{lang-fo|Nor\u00f0urlandah\u00fasi\u00f0}}) is the most important cultural institution in the Faroes. Its aim is to support and promote [[Scandinavia]]n and Faroese culture, locally and in the Nordic region. [[Erlendur Patursson]] (1913\u201386), Faroese member of the [[Nordic Council]], raised the idea of a Nordic cultural house in the Faroe Islands. A Nordic competition for architects was held in 1977, in which 158 architects participated. Winners were Ola Steen from [[Norway]] and Kolbr\u00fan Ragnarsd\u00f3ttir from [[Iceland]]. By staying true to [[folklore]], the architects built the Nordic House to resemble an enchanted hill of [[elf|elves]]. The house opened in [[T\u00f3rshavn]] in 1983. The Nordic House is a cultural organization under the Nordic Council. The Nordic House is run by a steering committee of eight, of whom three are Faroese and five from other Nordic countries. There is also a local advisory body of fifteen members, representing Faroese cultural organizations. The House is managed by a director appointed by the steering committee for a four-year term.\n\n===Traditional food===\n{{main|Faroese cuisine}}\nTraditional Faroese food is mainly based on meat, seafood and potatoes and uses few fresh vegetables. Mutton of the [[Faroe sheep]] is the basis of many meals, and one of the most popular treats is ''[[skerpikj\u00f8t]]'', well aged, wind-dried mutton, which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a ''hjallur'', is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are ''r\u00e6st kj\u00f8t'' (semi-dried mutton) and ''r\u00e6stur fiskur'', matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is ''[[tv\u00f8st og spik]]'', made from [[pilot whale]] meat and [[blubber]]. (A parallel meat/fat dish made with [[offal]] is ''[[garnat\u00e1lg]]''.) The tradition of consuming meat and blubber from pilot whales arises from the fact that a single kill can provide many meals. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do [[seabird]]s, such as [[Faroese puffin]]s, and their eggs. Dried fish is also commonly eaten.\n[[File:Dog as truck driver.jpg|thumb|right|Truck delivering [[Cadbury]] chocolate in the Faroe Islands]]\nThere are two breweries in the Faroe Islands. The first brewery is called [[F\u00f6roya Bj\u00f3r]] and has produced beer since 1888 with exports mainly to Iceland and Denmark. The second brewery is called Okkara Bryggjar\u00ed and was founded in 2010. A local specialty is ''fredrikk'', a special brew made in [[N\u00f3lsoy]]. Production of hard alcohol such as [[snaps]] is forbidden in the Faroe Islands, hence the Faroese [[akvavit]] is produced abroad.\n\nSince the friendly British occupation, the Faroese have been fond of British food, in particular [[fish and chips]] and British-style chocolate such as [[Cadbury Dairy Milk]], which is found in many of the island's shops.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nordic holiday ideas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/sep/02/scandinavia-holidays-sweden-lapland |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2011|last = Dixon|first = Rachel}}</ref>\n\n===Whaling===\n{{main|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Whaling in the Faroe Islands in August 2012.JPG|thumb|Boats driving a pod of pilot whales into a bay of [[Su\u00f0uroy]] in 2012]]\nThere are records of drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584.<ref>{{cite book |first=Philippa |last=Brakes |chapter=A background to whaling |year=2004 |editor=Philippa Brakes |editor2=Andrew Butterworth |editor3=Mark Simmonds |editor4=Philip Lymbery |title=Troubled Waters: A Review of the Welfare Implications of Modern Whaling Activities |isbn=0-9547065-0-1 |page=7 |chapter-url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/troubledwaters.pdf}}</ref> [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands]] is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the [[International Whaling Commission]] as there are disagreements about the Commission's legal authority to regulate [[cetacea]]n hunts. Hundreds of [[long-finned pilot whale]]s (''Globicephala melaena'') could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called ''grindadr\u00e1p'' in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay.<ref name=\"Home\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/en/home/|title=Home|publisher=}}</ref> When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun.\n\nFaroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the [[spinal cord]], which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and has been shown to reduce killing time to 1\u20132 seconds.<ref name=\"Home\"/>\n\nThis \"grindadr\u00e1p\" is legal and provides food for many people in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm#Drivingthewhales |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324072829/http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm |title=Whales and whaling in the Faroe Islands |publisher=Faroese Government |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=24 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031231236/http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |title=Why do whales and dolphins strand? |publisher=[[WDCS]] |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=31 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nicole|last=Chrismar|date=28 July 2006|title=Dolphins Hunted for Sport and Fertilizer|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2248161&page=1|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> However, a study has found whale meat and blubber to currently be contaminated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and not recommended for human consumption, as too much may cause such adverse health effects as birth defects of the nervous system, high blood pressure, damaged immune system, increased risk for developing [[Parkinson's disease]], [[hypertension]], [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]:\n{{quote|Therefore we recommend that adults eat no more than one to two meals a month.

Garments include sweaters, scarves, and gloves. Faroese jumpers have distinct Nordic patterns; each village has some regional variations handed down from mother to daughter. There has recently been a strong revival of interest in Faroese knitting, with young people knitting and wearing updated versions of old patterns emphasized by strong colours and bold patterns. This appears to be a reaction to the loss of traditional lifestyles, and as a way to maintain and assert cultural tradition in a rapidly-changing society. Many young people study and move abroad, and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific Faroese heritage.\n\nThere has also been a great interest in Faroese [[sweater]]s<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/sarah-lund-jumper-copyright-the-killing|title=Sarah Lund's jumper is exhibit A in a legal battle|first=Mark|last=Townsend|date=9 August 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> from the TV series ''[[The Killing (Danish TV series)|The Killing]]'', where the main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by [[Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l]]) wears Faroese sweaters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9533226/Fans-of-The-Killing-can-now-knit-their-own-Sarah-Lund-jumper.html|title=Fans of 'The Killing' can now knit their own Sarah Lund jumper|last=Hall|first=James|date=2012-09-10|access-date=2020-01-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n[[Lace knitting]] is a traditional handicraft. The most distinctive trait of [[Faroese lace shawls]] is the centre-back [[gusset]] shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping. These are worn by all generations of women, particularly as part of the traditional Faroese costume as an overgarment.\n\n[[File:Faroese folk dance club from vagar.jpg|thumb|left|Faroese folk dancers, some of them in national costume]]\nThe traditional Faroese national dress is also a local handicraft that people spend a lot of time, money, and effort to assemble. It is worn at weddings and traditional dancing events, and on feast days. The cultural significance of the garment should not be underestimated, both as an expression of local and national identity and a passing on and reinforcing of traditional skills that bind local communities together.\n\nA young Faroese person is normally handed down a set of children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are [[confirmed]] at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage. Traditionally the aim would have been to complete the outfit by the time a young person was ready to marry and wear the clothes at the ceremony\u2014though it is mainly only men who do this now.\n\nEach piece is intricately hand-knitted, dyed, woven or embroidered to the specifications of the wearer. For example, the man's waistcoat is put together by hand in bright blue, red or black fine wool. The front is then intricately embroidered with colourful silk threads, often by a female relative. The motifs are often local Faroese flowers or herbs. After this, a row of Faroese-made solid silver buttons are sewn on the outfit.\n\nWomen wear embroidered silk, cotton or wool shawls and pinafores that can take months to weave or embroider with local flora and fauna. They are also adorned with a handwoven black and red ankle-length skirt, knitted black and red jumper, a velvet belt, and black 18th century style shoes with silver buckles. The outfit is held together by a row of solid silver buttons, silver chains and locally-made silver brooches and belt buckles, often fashioned with Viking style motifs.\n\nBoth men's and women's national dress are extremely costly and can take many years to assemble. Women in the family often work together to assemble the outfits, including knitting the close-fitting jumpers, weaving and embroidering, sewing and assembling the national dress.\n\nThis tradition binds together families, passes on traditional crafts, and reinforces the Faroese culture of traditional village life in the context of a modern society.\n\n===Public holidays===\n[[File:F\u00f8roysk fl\u00f8gg \u00e1 \u00d3lavs\u00f8ku.jpg|thumb|The annual ''\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka'' parade on 28 July 2005.]]\n{{see also|Public holidays in Denmark}}\n''[[\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka]]'' is on 29 July; it commemorates the death of [[Saint Olaf]].

The peninsula has evolved from a place of reverence in ancient times into \"one of the most densely fortified and fought-over places in Europe\",<ref name=\"Rose, p. 95\">[[#Rose|Rose]], p. 95.</ref> as one historian has put it. [[Gibraltar]]'s location has given it an outsized significance in the history of Europe and its fortified town, established in medieval times, has hosted garrisons that sustained numerous sieges and battles over the centuries.\n\nGibraltar was first inhabited over 50,000 years ago by [[Neanderthal]]s and may have been one of their [[Neanderthals of Gibraltar|last places of habitation]] before they died out around 24,000 years ago. Gibraltar's [[recorded history]] began around 950 BC with the [[Phoenicians]], who lived nearby. The [[Carthaginians]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] later worshipped [[Hercules]] in shrines said to have been built on the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], which they called ''Mons Calpe'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lane|first1=K|last2=Finlayson|first2=C|last3=Vagelpohl|first3=U|last4=Jose Giles Guzman|first4=F|last5=Giles Pacheco|first5=F|title=Myths, Moors and Holy War: Reassessing the History and Archaeology of Gibraltar and the Straits, ad 711\u20131462|journal=Medieval Archaeology|date=2014|volume=58|issue=1|pages=136\u2013161}}</ref> the \"Hollow Mountain\", and which they regarded as one of the twin [[Pillars of Hercules]].\n\nGibraltar became part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] of [[Hispania]] following the collapse of the Roman Empire and came under Muslim [[Moors|Moorish]] rule in 711 AD. It was [[Moorish Gibraltar|permanently settled for the first time]] by the Moors and was renamed ''Jebel Tariq'' \u2013 the Mount of Tariq, later corrupted into ''Gibraltar''. The Christian [[Crown of Castile]] annexed it in 1309, lost it again to the Moors in 1333 and finally regained it in 1462. Gibraltar became part of the unified [[Spain|Kingdom of Spain]] and remained under Spanish rule until 1704. It was captured during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] by an [[Kingdom of England|Anglo]]-[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] fleet in the name of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI of Austria]], the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] contender to the Spanish throne. At the war's end, Spain ceded the territory to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713.\n\nSpain tried to regain control of Gibraltar, which Britain had declared a [[Crown colony]], through military, diplomatic and economic pressure. Gibraltar was besieged and heavily bombarded during three wars between Britain and Spain but the attacks were repulsed on each occasion. By the end of the last siege, in the late 18th century, Gibraltar had faced fourteen sieges in 500 years. In the years after [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], Gibraltar became a major base in the [[Peninsular War]]. The colony grew rapidly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, becoming a key British possession in the Mediterranean. It was a key stopping point for vessels en route to [[India]] via the [[Suez Canal]]. A large British naval base was constructed there at great expense at the end of the 19th century and became the backbone of Gibraltar's economy.\n\nBritish control of Gibraltar enabled the Allies to control the entrance to the Mediterranean during the [[Second World War]]. It was attacked on several occasions by [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] and [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces, though without causing much damage. The Spanish dictator General [[Francisco Franco]] declined to join a Nazi plan to occupy Gibraltar but revived Spain's claim to the territory after the war. As the territorial dispute intensified, Spain closed its border with Gibraltar between 1969 and 1985 and communications links were severed. Spain's position was supported by Latin American countries but was rejected by Britain and the [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]] themselves, who vigorously asserted their right to [[self-determination]]. Discussions of Gibraltar's status have continued between Britain and Spain but have not reached any conclusion.\n\nSince 1985, Gibraltar has undergone major changes as a result of reductions in Britain's overseas defence commitments. Most British forces have left the territory, which is no longer seen as a place of major military importance. Its economy is now based on [[Tourism in Gibraltar|tourism]], financial services, [[Shipping in Gibraltar|shipping]] and Internet gambling. Gibraltar is largely self-governed, with [[Parliament of Gibraltar|its own parliament]] and [[Government of Gibraltar|government]], though the UK maintains responsibility for defence and foreign policy. Its economic success had made it one of the wealthiest areas of the [[European Union]].\n\n==Geographical background==\n\n[[File:Gibraltar World Wind view annotated.jpg|right|thumb|300px|alt=Satellite view of the Strait of Gibraltar, with key locations marked|Annotated satellite view of the Strait of Gibraltar]]\nThe history of Gibraltar has been driven by its strategic position near the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a narrow peninsula at the eastern side of the [[Bay of Gibraltar]], {{convert|4|mi|km|0|order=flip}} from the city of [[Algeciras]]. Gibraltar is on the far south coast of Spain at one of the narrowest points in the Mediterranean, only {{convert|15|mi|order=flip}} from the coast of [[Morocco]] in North Africa. Its position on the bay makes it an advantageous natural anchorage for ships.<ref name=\"Dennis\"/> As one writer has put it, \"whoever controls Gibraltar also controls the movement of ships into and out of the Mediterranean. In terms of military and naval power, few places have a more strategic location than Gibraltar.\"<ref>[[#Krieger|Krieger]], p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe territory's area measures only {{convert|2.6|sqmi|order=flip}}. Most of the land area is occupied by the steeply sloping Rock of Gibraltar which reaches a height of {{convert|426|m}}. The town of Gibraltar lies at the base of the Rock on the west side of the peninsula. A narrow, low-lying isthmus connects the peninsula to the Spanish mainland. The North Face of the Rock is a nearly vertical cliff {{convert|396|m}} high overlooking the isthmus; the only land access to the town is via a coastal strip about {{convert|350|m}} wide, which was considerably narrower before the [[Land reclamation|reclamation of land]] from the sea during the 20th century.<ref name=\"Dennis\">[[#Dennis|Dennis]], pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's geography has thus given it considerable natural defensive advantages. It is virtually impossible to scale the eastern or northern sides of the Rock, which are either vertical or nearly so. To the south, the relatively flat area around [[Europa Point]] is surrounded by cliffs which are up to {{convert|30|m}} high. The western side is the only practicable area for a landing, but even here the steep slopes on which the town is built work to the advantage of a defender. These factors have given it an enormous military significance over the centuries.<ref name=\"Dennis\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Prehistory and ancient history}} Prehistory and ancient history==\n<!-- DO NOT change anchor without updating incoming link at: Original inhabitants of Gibraltar -->\n\n[[File:Neanderthal skull from Forbes' Quarry.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Three\u2014quarter view of the mostly intact skull of a Neanderthal female|\"[[Gibraltar 1|Gibraltar Woman]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 a Neanderthal who lived in Gibraltar some 50,000 years ago]]\n{{History of Gibraltar}}\nGibraltar's appearance in prehistory was very different.

The [[Phoenicians]] were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the ''[[genius loci]]'' of the place,<ref>[[#Parcerisa|Padr\u00f3 i Parcerisa]], p. 128.</ref> as did the [[Carthaginians]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] after them.

It lacked easily accessible fresh water, fertile soil or a safe natural anchorage on the shoreline. Avienus cited the \"shallow draft and dense mud of the shore\" as reasons not to land there. Its geographical location, which later became its key strategic asset, was not a significant factor during the Classical period as the entrance to the Mediterranean was not contested by the states of the day.<ref name=\"Devenish-72\"/><ref name=Jackson-22>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 22.</ref>\n\nFor these reasons the ancients instead settled at the head of the bay in what is today known as the [[Campo de Gibraltar|''Campo'' (hinterland) of Gibraltar]].<ref name=Jackson-22/> The town of [[Carteia]], near the location of the modern Spanish town of [[San Roque, C\u00e1diz|San Roque]], was founded by the Phoenicians around 950 BC on the site of an early settlement of the native [[Turdetani]] people.<ref>[[#Shields|Shields]], p. ix.</ref> The Carthaginians took control of the town by 228 BC and it was captured by the Romans in 206 BC.<ref>[[#Collins|Collins]], p. 106.</ref> It subsequently became [[Pompey]]'s western base in his campaign of 67 BC against the pirates that menaced the Mediterranean Sea at the time.<ref>[[#Truver|Truver]], p. 161.</ref> Carteia appears to have been abandoned after the [[Vandals]] sacked it in 409 AD during their march through Roman [[Hispania]] to [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].<ref>[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 18.</ref> The region subsequently fell under the rule of the Christianised [[Visigoths]].<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 14.</ref>\n\n==Moorish rule (711\u20131309, 1333\u20131462)==\n{{main|Moorish Gibraltar}}\n[[File:Tower of Homage Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A square tower with gardens in the foreground and a connecting wall on the right\u2014hand side|The 14th-century Tower of Homage, the largest surviving fragment of Gibraltar's [[Moorish Castle]]]]\nBy 681 the armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] had expanded from their original homeland of [[Arabia]] to conquer North Africa, the Middle East and large parts of West Asia, bringing Islam in their wake and converting local peoples to the new religion. The [[Berbers]] of North Africa, called [[Moors]] by the Christians, thereby became Muslims. The Strait of Gibraltar became the frontier between Muslim North Africa and Christian [[Hispania]] and thus gained a new strategic significance. Hispania descended into civil war in the 8th century as rival Visigothic factions fought for control of the throne. This gave the Moors the opportunity to invade Hispania and pursue a course of dividing-and-conquering the Christian factions.<ref name=\"Hills30\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 30.</ref><ref name=\"Jackson21-25\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 21\u201325.</ref>\n\nFollowing a raid in 710, a predominately Berber army under the command of [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] crossed from North Africa in April 711 and landed somewhere in the vicinity of Gibraltar (though most likely not in the bay or at the Rock itself).<ref name=\"Hills30\"/><ref name=\"Jackson21-25\"/> Although Tariq's expedition was an outstanding success and led to the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Islamic conquest of most of the Iberian peninsula]], he ended his career in disgrace after falling out with the Arab general [[Musa bin Nusayr]].<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 28.</ref> His conquest nonetheless left a long-lasting legacy for Gibraltar: ''Mons Calpe'' was renamed ''Jebel Tariq'', the Mount of Tariq, subsequently corrupted into ''Gibraltar''.<ref name=Hills-13/>\n\nGibraltar was fortified for the first time in 1160 by the [[Almohad]] Sultan [[Abd al-Mu'min]] in response to the coastal threat posed by the Christian kings of [[Aragon]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. Gibraltar was renamed ''Jebel al-Fath'' (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist,<ref name=Hills-13/> and a fortified town named ''Medinat al-Fath'' (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\n\nIn the late thirteen and early fourteenth centuries the [[Crown of Castile]] fought with the [[Marinids]] of Morocco and the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrids]] of [[Emirate of Granada|Granada]] for control of the Strait of Gibraltar. This conflict ({{lang-es|link=no|la Cuesti\u00f3n del Estrecho}}) is a major chapter in the history of the Christian reconquest of Spain. Although no documentary account of Gibraltar is available for the period following the creation of Madinat al-Fath, there are reasons to believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of [[Tarifa]] in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that the Castilian king [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] would lay siege to [[Algeciras]] (though in the event, he did not do so) to hinder the Marinids' communications with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have made it necessary to set up a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would protect the [[rearguard]] of Algeciras and provided a fallback position if the town fell. At the same time, the heights of the Rock of Gibraltar provided an excellent vantage point for monitoring the activities of the Christian fleets in the Straits.<ref>[[#Harvey|Harvey]], p. 35.</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1309 when Gibraltar's defences were put to the test for the first time in the [[First Siege of Gibraltar]]. That year [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] and [[James II of Aragon]] joined forces to attack the Muslim [[Emirate of Granada]], targeting [[Almer\u00eda]] in the east and Algeciras, across the bay from Gibraltar, in the west.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 38.</ref> In July 1309 the Castilians laid siege to both [[Siege of Algeciras (1309\u20131310)|Algeciras]] and Gibraltar. By this time the latter had a modest population of around 1,200 people, a castle and rudimentary fortifications. They proved unequal to the task of keeping out the Castilians and Gibraltar's Nasrid defenders surrendered after a month.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 39\u201340.</ref> Ferdinand gave up the siege of Algeciras the following February but held on to Gibraltar, expelling the Moors and repopulating it with Christians. A keep and dockyard were built on his orders to secure Castile's hold on the peninsula.<ref>[[#Hills|Hills]], p.&nbsp;49\u201350.</ref> Ferdinand also issued a [[letters patent]] granting privileges to the inhabitants to encourage people to settle, as it was initially not regarded as a particularly hospitable place to live.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n[[File:Moorish Baths, Gibraltar Museum 09.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A brick\u2014lined room with two curved brick arches supported on round stone pillars|Gibraltar's Moorish Baths, now incorporated into the [[Gibraltar Museum]]]]\nIn 1315 the Nasrid Moors of Granada [[Second Siege of Gibraltar|attempted to recapture Gibraltar]] but abandoned a brief siege when a Castilian relief force appeared. Eighteen years later, the Nasrid Sultan of Granada, [[Muhammed IV, Sultan of Granada|Muhammed]] and the [[Marinid]] Sultan of [[Fes|Fez]], [[Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman]], united to [[Third Siege of Gibraltar|besiege Gibraltar]] with a large army and naval force.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 42.</ref> This time the king of Castile, [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]], was unable to raise a relief force for several months because of the threat of rebellions within his kingdom. The relief force eventually arrived in June 1333 but found that the starving inhabitants of Gibraltar had already surrendered to the Moors of Fez.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 44.</ref> The Castilians now found themselves having to [[Fourth Siege of Gibraltar|besiege an entrenched enemy]], but they were unable to break through the Moorish defences and, faced with a stalemate, the two sides agreed to disengage in exchange for mutual concessions and a four-year truce.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 46.</ref>\n\nAbu al-Hasan refortified Gibraltar with what the Arab chroniclers called \"strong walls as a halo surrounds a crescent moon\" in anticipation of renewed war, which duly broke out in 1339.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 47.</ref> However, his forces suffered a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of R\u00edo Salado]] in October 1340 and fell back to Algeciras.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 49.</ref> The Castilians [[Siege of Algeciras (1342\u201344)|besieged the city for two years]] and eventually forced its surrender, though Gibraltar remained in Moorish hands.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 51.</ref> The peninsula's defences had been greatly improved by Abu al-Hasan's construction of new walls, towers, magazines and a citadel, making its capture a much more difficult endeavour.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 52.</ref> Alfonso XI once again [[Fifth Siege of Gibraltar|laid siege in 1349]] following the death of Abu al-Hasan but was thwarted by the arrival of the [[Black Death]] in 1350, which killed many of his soldiers and claimed his own life.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 52\u201353.</ref>\n\nGibraltar remained in Moorish hands until 1462 but was disputed between the Nasrids of Granada and Marinids of Fez. In 1374 the latter handed the peninsula to the former, apparently in payment for Granadan military support in suppressing rebellions in [[Morocco]].<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 55.</ref> Gibraltar's garrison rebelled against the Nasrids in 1410 but a Granadan army retook the place the following year after [[Sixth Siege of Gibraltar|a brief siege]]. Gibraltar was subsequently used by the Granadans as the base for raids into Christian territory, prompting [[Enrique P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 2nd Count de Niebla|Enrique de Guzm\u00e1n, second Count of Niebla]], to [[Seventh Siege of Gibraltar|lay siege in 1436]]. The attempt ended in disaster; the attack was repelled with heavy casualties and Enrique himself was drowned while trying to escape by sea. His body was recovered by the Moors, decapitated and hung on the walls of Gibraltar for the next twenty-two years.<ref name=\"Jackson56\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 56.</ref>\n\nMoorish rule over Gibraltar came to an end in August 1462 when a small Castilian force under the command of Alonso de Arcos, the governor of Tarifa, launched [[Eighth Siege of Gibraltar|a surprise attack]]. The Castilians mounted their attack while Gibraltar's senior commanders and townspeople were away paying homage to the new sultan of Granada. After a short assault which inflicted heavy losses on the defenders, the garrison surrendered to Enrique de Guzm\u00e1n's son [[Juan Alonso de Guzm\u00e1n, 1st Duke of Medina Sidonia|Juan Alonso]], now the first [[Duke of Medina Sidonia]]. The Moorish inhabitants were once again expelled ''en masse'', to be replaced by Christians.<ref name=\"Jackson57-8\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 57\u201358.</ref>\n\n==Castilian and Spanish rule (1462\u20131704)==\n[[File:Original coat of arms of Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|alt=A parchment document with Latin writing in yellow ink and an armorial device in the middle, showing a red castle with a key hanging below on a white and red background, surrounded by a gold shield|The [[Coat of arms of Gibraltar|arms]] granted to the city of Gibraltar by a [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] passed in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] on 10 July 1502 by [[Isabella I of Castile]]]]\nShortly after Gibraltar's recapture, King [[Henry IV of Castile]] declared it Crown property and reinstituted the special privileges which his predecessor had granted during the previous period of Christian rule.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 63.</ref> Four years after visiting Gibraltar in 1463, he was overthrown by the Spanish nobility and clergy.

Those that did not convert left for North Africa, some of them travelling via Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 71\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 71.</ref>\n\nGibraltar became Crown property again in 1501 at the order of Isabella and the following year it received a new [[Coat of arms of Gibraltar|set of royal arms]], which is still used by modern Gibraltar, replacing those of Medina Sidonia. In the Royal Warrant accompanying the arms, Isabella highlighted Gibraltar's importance as \"the key between these our kingdoms in the Eastern and Western Seas [the Mediterranean and Atlantic]\". The metaphor was represented on the royal arms by a golden key hanging from the front gate of a battlemented fortress. The warrant charged all future Spanish monarchs to \"hold and retain the said City for themselves and in their own possession; and that no alienation of it, nor any part of it, nor its jurisdiction&nbsp;... shall ever be made from the Crown of Castile.\"<ref name=\"Jackson-72\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 72.</ref>\n\nAt this point in history, \"Gibraltar\" meant not just the peninsula but the entire surrounding area including the land on which the towns of [[La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n]], San Roque, [[Los Barrios]] and Algeciras now stand. To the east, Gibraltar was bounded by the [[Guadiaro River]], and its northern boundaries lay in the vicinity of [[Castellar de la Frontera]], [[Jimena de la Frontera]], [[Alcal\u00e1 de los Gazules]], [[Medina-Sidonia]] and [[Tarifa, Spain|Tarifa]]. From the 16th century, the modern meaning of the name came to be adopted \u2013 specifically referring only to the town of Gibraltar and the peninsula on which it stands.<ref name=\"Devenish, p. 120\">[[#Devenish|Devenish]], p. 120.</ref>\n\nUnder Spanish Crown rule, the town of Gibraltar fell into severe decline. The end of Muslim rule in Spain and the Christian capture of the southern ports considerably decreased the peninsula's strategic value. It derived some minor economic value from [[tuna]]-fishing and wine-producing industries but its usefulness as a fortress was now limited. It was effectively reduced to the status of an unremarkable stronghold on a rocky promontory and [[Marbella]] replaced it as the principal Spanish port in the region.<ref>[[#Finlayson|Fa, Finlayson]], p. 17.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's inhospitable terrain made it an unpopular place to live. To boost the population, convicts from the kingdom of Granada were offered the possibility of serving their sentence in the Gibraltar garrison as an alternative to prison.<ref>[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 104.</ref> Despite its apparent unattractiveness, [[Juan Alfonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 3rd Duke of Medina Sidonia|Juan Alfonso de Guzm\u00e1n, third Duke of Medina Sidonia]], nonetheless sought to regain control of the town. In September 1506, following Isabella's death, he [[Tenth Siege of Gibraltar|laid siege]] in the expectation that the gates would quickly be opened to his forces. This did not happen, and after a fruitless four-month blockade he gave up the attempt. Gibraltar received the title of \"Most Loyal\" from the Spanish crown in recognition of its faithfulness.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 73.</ref>\n\n===Barbary pirate raids and wars with other European powers===\n[[File:Charles V Wall.jpg|thumb|right|alt=View of a stone wall descending a steep slope, with a harbour in the background|[[Charles V Wall]], built by the Spanish to control access to the south side of Gibraltar after the pirate raid of September 1540]]\nDespite continuing external threats Gibraltar was neglected by the Spanish crown and its fortifications fell into disrepair. [[Barbary pirates]] from North Africa took advantage of the weak defences in September 1540 by mounting a major raid in which hundreds of Gibraltar's residents were taken as hostages or slaves. The [[Shrine of Our Lady of Europe]] was sacked and all its valuables were stolen. Many of the captives were subsequently released when a Spanish fleet commanded by [[Bernardino de Mendoza (Captain General)|Bernardino de Mendoza]] intercepted the pirate ships near [[Battle of Albor\u00e1n|Albor\u00e1n]] as they were bringing ransomed hostages back to Gibraltar. The Spanish crown belatedly responded to Gibraltar's vulnerability by building the [[Charles V Wall]] to control the southern flank of the Rock and commissioning the Italian engineer [[Giovanni Battista Calvi]] to strengthen other parts of the fortifications.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 75.</ref>\n\nThe seas around Gibraltar continued to be dangerous for decades to come as Barbary pirate raids continued; although a small squadron of Spanish galleys was based at the port to counter pirate raids, it proved to be of limited effectiveness and many inhabitants were abducted and sold into slavery by the pirates. The problem worsened significantly after 1606, when Spain expelled the [[Morisco]]s;\u2013 Muslims who had converted to Christianity. Many of the expellees were evacuated to North Africa via Gibraltar but ended up joining the pirate fleets, either as Christian slaves or reconverted Muslims, and raided as far afield as [[Cornwall]].<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 78\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 78.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Gibraltar 1607.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of a fleet of ships showing one ship exploding in flames, with men and debris flying in the air and other men in the water, jumping overboard or taking to lifeboats |''The Explosion of the Spanish Flagship during the [[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]]'' by [[Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen]] ]]\nThe threat of the Barbary pirates was soon joined by that of Spain's enemies in northern Europe. On 5 May 1607, during the [[Eighty Years' War]], a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] fleet under Admiral [[Jacob van Heemskerk]] ambushed a Spanish fleet at anchor in the Bay of Gibraltar. The Dutch won an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]], losing no ships and very few men while the entire Spanish fleet was destroyed with the loss of 3,000 men.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 80.</ref> The Spanish and Dutch declared a temporary truce in 1609 (the [[Twelve Years' Truce]]) and resumed hostilities in 1621, when a joint Dutch and Danish fleet arrived in the Strait to attack Spanish shipping. This time the Spanish succeeded in capturing and sinking a number of the attackers' ships in the [[Battle of Gibraltar (1621)|Battle of Gibraltar]], driving away the rest.<ref name=\"Jackson-81\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 81.</ref>\n\nAn English military presence was briefly established at Gibraltar for the first time in 1620. The Spanish granted permission for the English fleet to use Gibraltar's port as a base for operations against the Barbary pirates, who were raiding the British and Irish coasts. Some in England had ambitions to turn the fleet against Spain rather than the Barbary coast. However, [[James VI and I|James I]] successfully resisted [[Parliament of England|Parliamentary]] pressure to declare war on Spain and the fleet returned to England.<ref name=\"Jackson-81\"/> After [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ascended the throne in 1625, a second English fleet was sent to the region with instructions to \"take or spoil a town\" on the Spanish coast. Gibraltar was one of the proposed targets on the basis that it was small, could easily be garrisoned, supplied and defended, and was in a highly strategic location. The English fleet instead attacked [[C\u00e1diz]] in the belief that its sacking would be more immediately profitable, but [[C\u00e1diz Expedition (1625)|the raid]] turned into a fiasco. The landing force looted the town's wine stores and was evacuated after four days of mass drunkenness without anything useful having been achieved.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe presence of Spain's enemies in the Straits prompted the Spanish king [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] to order Gibraltar's defences to be strengthened. A new [[South Mole, Gibraltar Harbour|mole]] and gun platforms were built, though the latter's usefulness was limited due to a lack of gunners. The town was an unsanitary, crowded place, which probably contributed to the outbreak in 1649 of an epidemic&nbsp;\u2013 reportedly [[Plague (disease)|plague]] but possibly [[typhoid fever|typhoid]]&nbsp;\u2013 which killed a quarter of the population.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 84.</ref> English fleets returned to Gibraltar in 1651\u201352 and again in 1654\u201355 as temporary allies of the Spanish against French and Dutch shipping in the Straits.<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 86\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 86.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gibraltar in 1654 (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Gibraltar'', 1654 by [[Jan Peeters I]]]]\nIn 1654, [[Oliver Cromwell]] decided to turn on Spain (which had been the first state to recognise the [[Commonwealth of England]]) and seize the island of [[Hispaniola]] to make it a base for English expansion in the Caribbean. To do so, two fleets were fitted out: one set out to America and another to the western Mediterranean with the ostensible objective of fighting the Barbary pirates. The fleet in the Caribbean failed to seize Hispaniola but took over [[Jamaica]] instead in May 1655. The fleet in the Mediterranean sailed off C\u00e1diz trying to intercept the Spanish treasure fleet with no success. With the arrival of the winter, the fleet went back to England. However, Spain did not declare [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654\u201360)|war on England]] until February 1656.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p.&nbsp;85\u201386.</ref> Shortly afterwards, a fleet of 49 English warships manned by 10,000 sailors and soldiers sailed through the Straits and reconnoitred Gibraltar.

England, the Netherlands, Austria, [[Portugal]], Savoy and some of the German states supported Charles, fearing that Philip's accession would result in French domination of Europe and the Americas.

The following February, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] broke out when French forces arrived in the Spanish Netherlands and expelled the Dutch from the [[barrier town]]s.

In 1703, Marlborough devised a plan under which his forces would launch a surprise attack against the French and their [[Bavaria]]n allies in the [[Danube]] basin while Rooke carried out a diversionary naval offensive in the Mediterranean.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 92.</ref> Rooke was instructed to attack French or Spanish coastal towns, though the choice of target was left to his discretion.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 93.</ref>\n\nWhen Rooke arrived in the region several targets were considered. An attempt to incite the inhabitants of [[Barcelona]] to revolt against Philip V failed, and a plan to assault the French naval base at [[Toulon]] was abandoned, and an earlier attempt to take [[Battle of C\u00e1diz (1702)|C\u00e1diz]] had failed. Casting around for an easier target, Rooke decided to attack Gibraltar for three principal reasons: it was poorly garrisoned and fortified, it would be of major strategic value to the war effort, and its capture might encourage the inhabitants of southern Spain to reject Philip.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 94.</ref>\n\n[[Capture of Gibraltar|The attack]] was launched on 1 August 1704 as a combined operation between the naval force under Rooke's command and a force of Dutch and English marines under the command of [[Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt]] and Captain [[Edward Whitaker]] of [[HMS Dorsetshire (1694)|HMS ''Dorsetshire'']].<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 96.</ref> After a heavy naval bombardment on 2 August, the marines launched a pincer attack on the town, advancing south from the isthmus and north from Europa Point.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 97.</ref> Gibraltar's defenders were well stocked with food and ammunition but were heavily outnumbered and outgunned.

The inhabitants and garrison of Gibraltar were promised freedom of religion and the maintenance of existing rights if they wished to stay, on condition that they swore an oath of loyalty to Charles as King of Spain. As had happened two years previously in the raid on C\u00e1diz, the discipline of the landing forces soon broke down. There were numerous incidents of rape, all Catholic churches but one (the Parish Church of St. Mary the Crowned, now the [[Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned|Cathedral]]) were desecrated or converted into military storehouses, and religious symbols such as the statue of [[Our Lady of Europe]] were damaged and destroyed. Angry Spanish inhabitants took violent reprisals against the occupiers. English and Dutch soldiers and sailors were attacked and killed, and their bodies were thrown into wells and cesspits.<ref name=Jackson-99>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 99.</ref>\n\nWhen the Spanish garrison marched out on 7 August almost all of the inhabitants, some 4,000 people in total, evacuated the town.

Many settled nearby in the ruins of Algeciras or around [[Santa Mar\u00eda la Coronada Church|an old hermitage]] at the head of the bay in the expectation of a prompt return. They took with them the records of the city council including Gibraltar's banner and royal warrant. In time the refugee settlement at the hermitage developed into the town of San Roque. It was regarded by the Spanish, as Philip V put it in 1706, as being the \"City of Gibraltar resident in its Campo\". A small population of around seventy (mainly neutral [[Genoa|Genoese]] people) stayed behind in Gibraltar.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 101.</ref>\n\nThe Grand Alliance's control of Gibraltar was challenged on 24 August when a French fleet entered the Straits.

The British commandant, Major General [[John Shrimpton]], was appointed by Charles as Gibraltar's governor in 1705 on the advice of Queen Anne.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 113.</ref> The Queen subsequently declared Gibraltar a [[free port]] at the insistence of the Sultan of Morocco, though she had no formal authority to do so. Shrimpton was replaced in 1707 by Colonel [[Roger Elliott]], who was replaced in turn by Brigadier [[Thomas Stanwix]] in 1711; this time the appointments were made directly by London with no claim of authority from Charles. Stanwix was ordered to expel all foreign troops from Gibraltar to secure its status as an exclusively British possession but failed to evict the Dutch, apparently not considering them \"foreign\".<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 114.</ref>\n\nThe War of the Spanish Succession was finally settled in 1713 by a series of treaties and agreements. Under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which was signed on 13 July 1713 and brought together a number of sub-treaties and agreements, Philip V was accepted by Britain and Austria as King of Spain in exchange for guarantees that the crowns of France and Spain would not be unified. Various territorial exchanges were agreed: although Philip V retained the Spanish overseas empire, he ceded the [[Southern Netherlands]], [[Naples]], Milan, and [[Sardinia]] to Austria; [[Sicily]] and some Milanese lands to [[Savoy]]; and [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]] to Great Britain. In addition he granted the British the exclusive right to non-Spanish [[history of slavery|slave trading]] in Spanish America for thirty years, the so-called ''[[asiento]]''. With regard to Gibraltar ([[:s:Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht between Spain and Great Britain#ARTICLE X|Article X]]), the town, fortifications and port (but not the hinterland) were ceded to Britain \"for ever, without any exception or impediment whatsoever.\" The treaty also stipulated that if Britain was ever to dispose of Gibraltar it would first have to offer the territory to Spain.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 113, 333\u2013334.</ref><ref name=\"Abulafia2011 497\">[[#Abulafia|Abulafia]], p. 47.</ref>\n\n==British rule (1713\u2013present)==\n\n===Consolidation and sieges===\nDespite its later importance to Britain, Gibraltar was initially seen by the British Government as more of a bargaining counter than a strategic asset.

Spain responded the following year by constructing a line of fortifications across the upper end of the peninsula, cutting off Gibraltar from its hinterland. The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as ''La L\u00ednea de Contravalaci\u00f3n'' (the Lines of [[Investment (military)|Contravallation]]), were later to give their name to the modern town of [[La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n]].<ref name=\"Jackson-139\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 139.</ref> Gibraltar was effectively blockaded by land but was able to rely on trade with Morocco for food and other supplies.<ref name=\"Jackson-140\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 140.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's civilian population increased steadily through the century to form a disparate mixture of Britons, Genoese, Jews, Spaniards and Portuguese.

The driving force behind this programme was the highly experienced Colonel (later Major General) [[William Green (general)|William Green]], who was to play a key role a few years later as chief engineer of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-147\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 147\u2013149.</ref> He was joined in 1776 by Lieutenant General [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|George Augustus Elliott]], a veteran of earlier wars against France and Spain who took over the governorship of Gibraltar at a key moment.<ref name=\"Jackson-150\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 150.</ref>\n\nBritain's successes in the [[Seven Years' War]] had left it with expensive commitments in the Americas that had to be paid for and had catalysed the formation of an anti-British coalition in Europe. The British Government's attempt to levy new taxes on the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[British America]] led to the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] in 1776. Spain declared war on Britain and [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|started the Anglo-Spanish War]] and then tried to recover Gibraltar with French aid.<ref name=\"Jackson-150\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]] lasted from 24 June 1779 to 7 February 1783 and remains one of the longest [[siege]]s endured by the [[British Armed Forces]], as well as being one of the longest continuous sieges in history.  A combined Spanish and French fleet [[blockade]]d Gibraltar from the sea, while on the land side an enormous army was engaged in constructing [[fortification|forts]], [[redoubt]]s, [[trench warfare|entrenchments]], and [[artillery battery|batteries]] from which to attack Gibraltar. The Spanish committed increasing number of troops and ships to the siege, postponing the planned invasion of England by the [[Armada of 1779]].  The first relief of the siege came in the spring of 1780 when [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral George Rodney]] captured a [[Action of 8 January 1780|Spanish convoy off Cape Finesterre]] and defeated a Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]], delivering reinforcements of 1,052 men and an abundance of supplies.\n\nThe British defenders continued to resist every attempt to capture Gibraltar by assault but supplies again began to run low.  On 12 April 1781 Vice Admiral [[George Darby]]'s squadron of 29 ships of the line escorting 100 store ships from England laden for Gibraltar entered the bay. The Spanish fleet was unable to intercept Darby's relief. The Spanish, frustrated by this failure, began a barrage of the town, causing great panic and terror among the civilian population.<ref name=\"Bradford1972_gs\">{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Ernle Dusgate Selby |date=1972 |title=Gibraltar: the history of a fortress |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-UjAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=16 April 2011}} ''To the citizen of the 20th Century, accustomed or the civilian casualties in war, and dulled to the annihilation of whole cities (or even nations), the horrified reaction of Gibraltar's garrison to the shelling of the town and its inhabitants may seem a trifle na\u00efve. But it must be remembered that in those days there was still a code of conduct in warfare, and some elementary humanity in those who waged it.''.</ref> Deliberate targeting of civilians was unprecedented at the time and was to continue for 2 years, obliterating any architectural heritage from the Spanish period.  Unable to starve the garrison out, the French and Spanish attempted further attacks by land and sea. The night before the Grand Attack on 27 November 1781, the British garrison filed silently out of their defence works and made a surprise [[sortie]], routing the besieging infantry in their trenches and postponed the grand assault on The Rock for some time.\n\nOn 13 September 1782 the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon allies]] launched their great attack; 5190 fighting men, both French and Spanish, aboard ten of the newly engineered '[[Floating battery|floating batteries]]' with 138<ref>Monti, p. 140.</ref> heavy guns, as well as 18 ships of the line, 40 Spanish gunboats and 20 bomb-vessels<ref name=\"Monti p138\">Monti, p. 138.</ref> with a total of 30,000 sailors and marines.

The British destroyed three of the floating batteries,<ref>Montero, pp. 365\u2013366.</ref> which blew up as the 'red-hot shot' did its job. The other seven batteries were scuttled by the Spanish.

The following evening a gale blew up, scattering the Spanish and French fleet and allowing Howe to sail unopposed into Gibraltar. A total of 34 ships of the line escorted 31 transport ships which delivered supplies, food, and ammunition. The fleet also brought the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers|25th]], [[59th (2nd Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot|59th]], and [[97th Regiment of Foot (1780)|97th]] regiments of foot bringing the total number of the garrison to over 7,000<ref>Syrett, p. 104\u2013105.</ref><ref>Chartrand, p. 23.</ref> Howe then sailed out and fought [[Battle of Cape Spartel|an indecisive battle]] with the combined allied fleet before withdrawing to Britain in line with his orders.\n\nThe siege was continued for some months longer, but in the spring of 1783 a preliminary peace agreement brought the cessation of hostilities. Finally, in February 1783 the siege was lifted.  The outcome of the Great Siege made it politically impossible for the British government to again consider trading away Gibraltar, even though King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] warned that it would be the source \"of another war, or at least of a constant lurking enmity\" and expressed his wish \"if possible to be rid of Gibraltar&nbsp;... I shall not think peace complete if we do not get rid of Gibraltar.\" General Eliott and the garrison were lauded for their heroism, and the tenacity of their defence of Gibraltar acquired, as one writer puts it, \"a sort of cult status\".<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref> The British public acquired \"an emotional, albeit irrational, attachment to the place.\"<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 10.</ref> The reputed impregnability of Gibraltar gave rise to the expression, which is still current today, of something being as \"strong as the Rock of Gibraltar\".<ref>[[#Finlayson|Fa, Finlayson]], p. 6.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar as a colony===\nFollowing the Great Siege, the civilian population of Gibraltar&nbsp;\u2013 which had fallen to under a thousand&nbsp;\u2013 expanded rapidly as the territory became both a place of economic opportunity and a refuge from the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Britain's loss of North American colonies in 1776 led to much of her trade being redirected to new markets in [[India]] and the [[East Indies]]. The favoured route to the east was via [[Egypt]], even before the [[Suez Canal]] had been built, and Gibraltar was the first British port reached by ships heading there. The new maritime traffic gave Gibraltar a greatly increased role as a trading port. At the same time, it was a haven in the western Mediterranean from the disruption of the Napoleonic Wars. Many of the new immigrants were Genoese people who had fled Napoleon's annexation of the old [[Republic of Genoa]].<ref name=\"Jackson-181\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 181.</ref> By 1813 nearly a third of the population consisted of Genoese and Italians. Portuguese made up another 20 per cent, Spaniards 16.5 per cent, Jews 15.5 per cent, British 13 per cent and Menorcans 4 per cent.

Don implemented improved sanitation and drainage as well as introducing street lighting, rebuilding [[St Bernard's Hospital]] to serve the civilian population and initiating the construction of the [[Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Gibraltar|Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]] to serve Gibraltar's Protestant civilians.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], pp. 161\u2013162.</ref> For the first time, civilians began to have a say in the running of Gibraltar. An Exchange and Commercial Library was founded in 1817, with the Exchange Committee initially focused on furthering the interests of merchants based in the fortress. The Committee evolved into a local civilian voice in government, although it had no real powers.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 162.</ref> A City Council was established in 1821, and in 1830 Gibraltar became a [[Crown colony]]. In the same year, the [[Gibraltar Police Force]] was established, modelled on London's pioneering [[Metropolitan Police Service]],<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 163.</ref> and [[Court system of Gibraltar|a Supreme Court]] was set up to try civil, criminal and mixed cases.<ref name=\"Jackson-229\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 229.</ref>\n\nThe economic importance of Gibraltar changed following the invention of [[steamboat|steamships]]; the first one to reach Gibraltar's harbour arrived there in 1823.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 166.</ref> The advent of steamships caused a major shift in trade patterns in the Mediterranean. Transshipment, which had previously been Gibraltar's principal economic mainstay, was largely replaced by the much less lucrative work of servicing visiting steamships through coaling, victualling and ferrying of goods. Although Gibraltar became a key coaling station where British steamships refuelled on the way to [[Alexandria]] or [[Cape Horn]], the economic changes resulted in a prolonged depression that lasted until near the end of the century.<ref name=\"Jackson-242\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 242.</ref> The demand for labour for coaling was such that Gibraltar instituted the practice of relying on large numbers of imported Spanish workers. A shanty town sprang up on the site of the old Spanish fortifications just across the border, which became the workers' town of La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n. The poor economy meant that Gibraltar's population barely changed between 1830 and 1880, but it was still relatively more prosperous than the severely impoverished south of Spain. As a consequence, La L\u00ednea's population doubled over the same period and then doubled again in the following 20 years.<ref>[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 381.</ref>\n[[File:Frederick Leeds Edridge 1833 Castle Street.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Painting of a street scene showing people and pack animals going up and down a steep street, with several women wearing the traditional red cloak of Gibraltar|Castle Street, Gibraltar, by [[Frederick Leeds Edridge]], 1833]]\nVisiting Gibraltar in the mid-19th century, the English writer [[Richard Ford (writer)|Richard Ford]] wrote in his ''[[A Handbook for Travellers in Spain|Handbook for Travellers in Spain]]'' that \"the differences of nations and costumes are very curious: a motley masquerade is held in this halfway house between Europe, Asia, and Africa, where every man appears in his own dress and speaks his own language.

The problem arose after Spain imposed tariffs on foreign manufactured goods in a bid to protect Spain's own fledgling industrial enterprises. Tobacco was also heavily taxed, providing one of the government's principal sources of revenue. The inevitable result was that Gibraltar, where cheap tobacco and goods were readily available, became a centre of intensive smuggling activity.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 172.</ref> The depressed state of the economy caused smuggling to become a mainstay of Gibraltar's trade;<ref name=\"Jackson-242\"/> the mid-19th-century Irish traveller Martin Haverty described Gibraltar as \"the grand smuggling depot for Spain\".<ref name=\"Haverty-219\"/> General Sir [[Robert Gardiner (British Army officer)|Robert Gardiner]], who served as Governor between 1848 and 1855, described the daily scene in a letter to British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]:\n\n{{quote|From the first early opening of the gates there is to be seen a stream of Spanish men, women and children, horses and a few caleches, passing into the town where they remain moving about from shop to shop until about noon.

The emergence of the Gibraltarians as a distinct group owed much to the pressure on housing in the territory and the need to control the numbers of the civilian population, as Gibraltar was still first and foremost a military fortress. Two [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] of 1873 and 1885 stipulated that no child of alien parent could be born in Gibraltar, no foreigners could claim a right of residence and that only Gibraltar-born inhabitants were entitled to reside there; everyone else needed permits, unless they were employees of the British Crown. In addition to the 14,244 Gibraltarians, there were also 711 British people, 695 Maltese and 960 from other British dominions.<ref name=\"Jackson-248\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 248.</ref> There were 1,869 Spaniards (of whom 1,341 were female) with smaller numbers of Portuguese, Italians, French and Moroccans.<ref name=\"Jackson-249\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 249.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar at war and peace===\n[[File:Gibraltar Harbour scene, February 1909.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A fleet of warships lined up in a harbour with thick clouds of smoke coming out of their funnels|The United States' [[Great White Fleet]] visiting Gibraltar harbour in February 1909]]\nBy the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, Gibraltar's future as a British colony was in serious doubt. Its economic value was diminishing, as a new generation of steamships with a much longer range no longer needed to stop there to refuel en route to more distant ports. Its military value was also increasingly in question due to advances in military technology. New long-range guns firing high-explosive shells could easily reach Gibraltar from across the bay or in the Spanish hinterland, while the development of [[torpedo]]es meant that ships at anchor in the bay were also vulnerable.<ref name=\"Jackson-256\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 255.</ref> The garrison could hold out for a long time, but if the Spanish coast was held by an enemy, Gibraltar could not be resupplied in the fashion that had saved it in the Great Siege 120 years earlier.<ref name=\"Bradford-169\">[[#Bradford|Bradford]], p. 169.</ref>\n\nA Spanish proposal to swap Gibraltar for [[Ceuta]] on the other side of the Strait was considered but was eventually rejected.<ref name=\"Quiroga\">[[#Quiroga|Quiroga]], page 39</ref> It was ultimately decided that Gibraltar's strategic position as a naval base outweighed its potential vulnerability from the landward side. From 1889, the [[Royal Navy]] was greatly expanded and both Gibraltar and Malta were equipped with new, torpedo-proof harbours and expanded, modernised dockyards.<ref name=\"Jackson-256\"/> The works at Gibraltar were carried out by some 2,200 men at the huge cost of \u00a35&nbsp;million (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.005|1898|2013|r=1}}}}&nbsp;billion in 2013 prices).<ref name=\"Jackson-257\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 257.</ref> Under the reforming leadership of [[First Sea Lord]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral John \"Jacky\" Fisher]], Gibraltar became the base for the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]].<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 189.</ref> In the British public's imagination, Gibraltar was seen as \"a symbol of British naval power [and] a symbol of the empire which has been built and, more than the British lion or even [[John Bull]] himself, has come to represent Britain's power and prestige across the world.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Gibraltar \u2013 Vital Point in War|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fjJlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NIkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2378,24256&dq=windmill-hill+gibraltar&hl=en|work=The Vancouver Sun|page=4|date=1 August 1940}}</ref>\n\nThe value of the naval base was soon apparent when the [[First World War]] broke out in August 1914. Only a few minutes after the declaration of war went into effect at midnight on 3/4 August, a German liner was captured by a torpedo boat from Gibraltar, followed by three more enemy ships the following day.<ref name=\"Hills-398\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 398.</ref> Although Gibraltar was well away from the main battlefields of the war \u2013 Spain remained neutral and the Mediterranean was not contested as it was in the Second World War&nbsp;\u2013 it played an important role in the Allied fight against the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|German U-boat campaign]]. The naval base was heavily used by Allied warships for resupplying and repairs. The Bay of Gibraltar was also used as a forming-up point for Allied convoys, while German U-boats stalked the Strait looking for targets. On two occasions, Gibraltar's guns unsuccessfully fired on two U-boats travelling through the Strait.<ref name=\"Jackson-264\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 264.</ref> Anti-submarine warfare was in its infancy and it proved impossible to prevent U-boats operating through the Strait. Only two days before the end of the war, on 9 November 1918, [[SM UB-50|SM ''UB-50'']] torpedoed and sank the British [[battleship]] [[HMS Britannia (1904)|HMS ''Britannia'']] off [[Cape Trafalgar]] to the west of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-265\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 265.</ref>\n\nThe restoration of peace inevitably meant a reduction in military expenditure, but this was more than offset by a large increase in liner and cruise ship traffic to Gibraltar. British liners travelling to and from [[India]] and South Africa customarily stopped there, as did French, Italian and Greek liners travelling to and from America. Oil bunkering became a major industry alongside coaling. An airfield was established in 1933 on the isthmus linking Gibraltar to Spain. Civil society was reformed as well; in 1921 an Executive Council and an elected City Council were established to advise the governor, in the first step towards self-government of the territory.<ref name=\"Jackson-268\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 268.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in July 1936 presented Gibraltar with major security concerns, as it was initially on the front lines of the conflict. The ultimately successful rebellion led by General [[Francisco Franco]] broke out across the Strait in Morocco, and the [[Spanish Republic (1931\u20131939)|Spanish Republican]] government sought on several occasions to regain control of the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]]-controlled area around Algeciras. Although Gibraltar was not directly affected by the fighting, the war caused significant disruption. An undetermined number of Spanish refugees, perhaps as many as 10,000 persons, fled to Gibraltar, resulting in severe overcrowding.<ref name=\"Stockey-93\">[[#Stockey|Stockey]], p. 93.</ref><ref name=\"Alexander206\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 206.</ref> A Non-Intervention Patrol was mounted by the Royal Navy, operating from Gibraltar, to prevent foreign military aid reaching the belligerents in Spain.

The situation changed drastically after April 1940 when [[Battle of France|Germany invaded France]], with [[Italian invasion of France|Italy joining the invasion]] in June 1940. The British Government feared that Spain would also enter the war and it was decided to [[evacuation of the Gibraltarian civilian population during World War II|evacuate the entire civilian population of Gibraltar]] in May 1940.<ref name=\"Jackson-271\"/> Most went to the United Kingdom and others to [[Madeira]] and [[Jamaica]], while some made their own way to [[Tangier]] and Spain. An intensive programme of tunnelling and refortification was undertaken; over {{convert|30|miles|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} of tunnels were dug in the Rock, and anti-aircraft batteries were installed in numerous locations in the territory. A new and powerful naval group called [[Force H]] was established at Gibraltar to control the entrance to the Mediterranean and support Allied forces in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.<ref name=\"Jackson-276\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 276.</ref> The airfield, which was now designated [[RAF North Front]], was also extended using soil from the tunnelling works so that it could accommodate bomber aircraft being ferried to North Africa.<ref name=\"Jackson-286\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 286.</ref> The garrison was greatly expanded, reaching a peak of 17,000 in 1943 with another 20,000 sailors and airmen accommodated in Gibraltar at the same time.<ref name=\"Jackson-293\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 293.</ref>\n\nDuring the Battle of the Atlantic, Gibraltar played a key role. The [[Convoy#World War II|Ocean Convoy System]] adopted by Britain after the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in June 1940 ran on two routes \u2013 an east\u2013west route between the UK and North America, and a north\u2013south route between the UK, Gibraltar and [[Freetown]] in British-ruled [[Sierra Leone]].<ref>[[#Grove|Grove]], p. 30.</ref> Even before the war, Gibraltar had been designated as one of the main assembly points for convoys heading inbound to Europe.<ref>[[#Baptiste|Baptiste]], p. 7.</ref> From late 1942, Gibraltar was the destination of the Central Atlantic convoy route between the United States and the Mediterranean in support of Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and elsewhere in the region.<ref>[[#Offley|Offley]], p. 371.</ref> A huge number of Allied troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between Gibraltar and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to Gibraltar.<ref>[[#Morison|Morison]], p. 250.</ref>\n\nGibraltar was directly attacked, both overtly and covertly, on several occasions during the war. [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] aircraft carried out bombing attacks in 1940 after the surprise attack of their fleet by the royal navy and there were sporadic raids from Italian and German long-range aircraft, though the damage caused was not significant.<ref name=\"Jackson-281\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 281.</ref> Franco's position changed subtly from one of neutrality to \"non-belligerence\",<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 11.</ref> which in practice meant allowing the Axis powers to operate covertly against Gibraltar from Spanish territory.

The immediate problem after [[VJ Day]] was a lack of shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to the southern end of the peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.<ref name=\"Jackson-296\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 296.</ref>\n\nIn the war's aftermath, Gibraltar took decisive steps towards implementing civilian self-governance over most issues of public policy. The [[Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights]] (AACR), led by Gibraltarian lawyer [[Joshua Hassan]], won all of the seats in the first post-war City Council elections in 1945. Women were given the right to vote in 1947, and in 1950 a Legislative Council was established.<ref name=\"Alexander-235\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 235.</ref> A two-party system had emerged by 1955 with the creation of the [[Commonwealth Party (Gibraltar)|Commonwealth Party]] as a rival to the AACR. That same year Hassan became the first Mayor of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Alexander-236\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 236.</ref> The Governor still retained overall authority and could overrule the Legislative Council. This inevitably caused tension and controversy if the Governor and Legislative Council disagreed, but in 1964 the British Government agreed to confine the powers of the Governor to matters of defence, security and foreign relations.<ref name=\"Alexander-237\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 237.</ref> A new constitution was decided on in 1968 and promulgated in 1969, merging the City Council and Legislative Council into a single House of Assembly (known as the [[Gibraltar Parliament]] since 2006) with 15 elected members, two non-elected officials and a speaker. The old title of \"Colony of Gibraltar\" was dropped and the territory was renamed as the City of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Alexander-241\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 241.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's post-war relationship with Spain was marred by an intensification of the long-running dispute over the territory's sovereignty. Although Spain had not attempted to use military force to regain Gibraltar since 1783, the question of sovereignty was still present. Disputes over smuggling and the sea frontier between Gibraltar and Spain had repeatedly caused diplomatic tensions during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Hills-375\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 375.</ref> The neutral zone between Spain and Gibraltar had also been a cause of disputes during the 19th and 20th centuries. This originally had been an undemarcated strip of sand on the isthmus between the British and Spanish lines of fortifications, about {{convert|1|km}} wide&nbsp;\u2013 the distance of a cannon shot in 1704. Over the years, however, Britain took control of most of the neutral zone, much of which is now occupied by Gibraltar's airport. This expansion provoked repeated protests from Spain.<ref name=\"Jackson-250\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 250.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gibraltar border 1977.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Two women standing at a closed line of gates, with the British and Spanish flags flying on separate poles on either side.|The closed gates at the border between Gibraltar and Spain, 1977]]\nSpain's push to regain sovereignty over Gibraltar was fuelled by the [[decolonization|decolonisation]] agenda of the United Nations, which had been initiated in 1946. In that year, Britain had listed Gibraltar among other \"Overseas Dependent Territories\" in conjunction with the drive towards decolonisation, but it was not appreciated at the time that Gibraltar was in a unique position; due to the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, it could only be British or Spanish and could not gain independence.<ref name=\"Jackson-303\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 303.</ref> Franco's government calculated that Britain would be willing to give up an expensive possession that no longer had a great deal of military value,<ref name=\"Jackson-294\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 294.</ref> but this turned out to be a fundamental misjudgement. The British government followed a policy of allowing its colonies to become self-governing entities before giving them the option of independence. Almost all took it, choosing to become independent republics. That option was not available to Gibraltar under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, which required that if Britain ever relinquished control it was to be handed back to Spain.<ref name=\"Jackson-295\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 295.</ref> The Gibraltarians strongly opposed this and organised [[1967 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum|a referendum in September 1967]] in which 12,138 voters opted to remain with Britain with just 44 supporting union with Spain, though a further 55 voting slips were blank or invalid.<ref name=\"Alexander-241\"/> Spain dismissed the outcome of the referendum, calling the city's inhabitants \"pseudo-Gibraltarians\"<ref name=\"Jackson-306\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 306.</ref> and stating that the \"real\" Gibraltarians were the descendants of the Spanish inhabitants who had resettled elsewhere in the region over 250 years earlier.<ref name=\"Alexander-237\"/>\n\nThe dispute initially took the form of symbolic protests and a campaign by Spanish diplomats and the state-controlled media. From 1954, Spain imposed increasingly stringent restrictions on trade and the movements of vehicles and people across the border with Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-300\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 300.</ref> Further restrictions were imposed in 1964,<ref name=\"Jackson-308\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 308.</ref> and in 1966 the frontier was closed to vehicles.  The following year, Spain closed its airspace to aircraft taking off or landing at [[Gibraltar International Airport]]. In 1969, after the passing of the [[Gibraltar Constitution Order 1969|Gibraltar Constitution Order]], to which Spain strongly objected, the frontier was closed completely and Gibraltar's telecommunications links through Spain were cut.<ref name=\"Jackson-316\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 316.</ref>\n\nThe Spanish decision had major consequences not only for the political relationship between Spain and the United Kingdom, but\nfor the people of Gibraltar, many of whom had relatives or homes in Spain. As one of the Gibraltarians who suffered the closure of the frontier explains:\n\n{{quote|The saddest sight was seeing people behind the wire fences on both sides of the land frontier yelling at the top of their voices across the wide dividing space to enquire about the state of relatives, as telephone communications had been cut by the Spaniards.

The peninsula has evolved from a place of reverence in ancient times into \"one of the most densely fortified and fought-over places in Europe\",<ref name=\"Rose, p. 95\">[[#Rose|Rose]], p. 95.</ref> as one historian has put it. [[Gibraltar]]'s location has given it an outsized significance in the history of Europe and its fortified town, established in medieval times, has hosted garrisons that sustained numerous sieges and battles over the centuries.\n\nGibraltar was first inhabited over 50,000 years ago by [[Neanderthal]]s and may have been one of their [[Neanderthals of Gibraltar|last places of habitation]] before they died out around 24,000 years ago. Gibraltar's [[recorded history]] began around 950 BC with the [[Phoenicians]], who lived nearby. The [[Carthaginians]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] later worshipped [[Hercules]] in shrines said to have been built on the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], which they called ''Mons Calpe'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lane|first1=K|last2=Finlayson|first2=C|last3=Vagelpohl|first3=U|last4=Jose Giles Guzman|first4=F|last5=Giles Pacheco|first5=F|title=Myths, Moors and Holy War: Reassessing the History and Archaeology of Gibraltar and the Straits, ad 711\u20131462|journal=Medieval Archaeology|date=2014|volume=58|issue=1|pages=136\u2013161}}</ref> the \"Hollow Mountain\", and which they regarded as one of the twin [[Pillars of Hercules]].\n\nGibraltar became part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] of [[Hispania]] following the collapse of the Roman Empire and came under Muslim [[Moors|Moorish]] rule in 711 AD. It was [[Moorish Gibraltar|permanently settled for the first time]] by the Moors and was renamed ''Jebel Tariq'' \u2013 the Mount of Tariq, later corrupted into ''Gibraltar''. The Christian [[Crown of Castile]] annexed it in 1309, lost it again to the Moors in 1333 and finally regained it in 1462. Gibraltar became part of the unified [[Spain|Kingdom of Spain]] and remained under Spanish rule until 1704. It was captured during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] by an [[Kingdom of England|Anglo]]-[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] fleet in the name of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI of Austria]], the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] contender to the Spanish throne. At the war's end, Spain ceded the territory to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713.\n\nSpain tried to regain control of Gibraltar, which Britain had declared a [[Crown colony]], through military, diplomatic and economic pressure. Gibraltar was besieged and heavily bombarded during three wars between Britain and Spain but the attacks were repulsed on each occasion. By the end of the last siege, in the late 18th century, Gibraltar had faced fourteen sieges in 500 years. In the years after [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], Gibraltar became a major base in the [[Peninsular War]]. The colony grew rapidly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, becoming a key British possession in the Mediterranean. It was a key stopping point for vessels en route to [[India]] via the [[Suez Canal]]. A large British naval base was constructed there at great expense at the end of the 19th century and became the backbone of Gibraltar's economy.\n\nBritish control of Gibraltar enabled the Allies to control the entrance to the Mediterranean during the [[Second World War]]. It was attacked on several occasions by [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] and [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces, though without causing much damage. The Spanish dictator General [[Francisco Franco]] declined to join a Nazi plan to occupy Gibraltar but revived Spain's claim to the territory after the war. As the territorial dispute intensified, Spain closed its border with Gibraltar between 1969 and 1985 and communications links were severed. Spain's position was supported by Latin American countries but was rejected by Britain and the [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]] themselves, who vigorously asserted their right to [[self-determination]]. Discussions of Gibraltar's status have continued between Britain and Spain but have not reached any conclusion.\n\nSince 1985, Gibraltar has undergone major changes as a result of reductions in Britain's overseas defence commitments. Most British forces have left the territory, which is no longer seen as a place of major military importance. Its economy is now based on [[Tourism in Gibraltar|tourism]], financial services, [[Shipping in Gibraltar|shipping]] and Internet gambling. Gibraltar is largely self-governed, with [[Parliament of Gibraltar|its own parliament]] and [[Government of Gibraltar|government]], though the UK maintains responsibility for defence and foreign policy. Its economic success had made it one of the wealthiest areas of the [[European Union]].\n\n==Geographical background==\n\n[[File:Gibraltar World Wind view annotated.jpg|right|thumb|300px|alt=Satellite view of the Strait of Gibraltar, with key locations marked|Annotated satellite view of the Strait of Gibraltar]]\nThe history of Gibraltar has been driven by its strategic position near the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a narrow peninsula at the eastern side of the [[Bay of Gibraltar]], {{convert|4|mi|km|0|order=flip}} from the city of [[Algeciras]]. Gibraltar is on the far south coast of Spain at one of the narrowest points in the Mediterranean, only {{convert|15|mi|order=flip}} from the coast of [[Morocco]] in North Africa. Its position on the bay makes it an advantageous natural anchorage for ships.<ref name=\"Dennis\"/> As one writer has put it, \"whoever controls Gibraltar also controls the movement of ships into and out of the Mediterranean. In terms of military and naval power, few places have a more strategic location than Gibraltar.\"<ref>[[#Krieger|Krieger]], p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe territory's area measures only {{convert|2.6|sqmi|order=flip}}. Most of the land area is occupied by the steeply sloping Rock of Gibraltar which reaches a height of {{convert|426|m}}. The town of Gibraltar lies at the base of the Rock on the west side of the peninsula. A narrow, low-lying isthmus connects the peninsula to the Spanish mainland. The North Face of the Rock is a nearly vertical cliff {{convert|396|m}} high overlooking the isthmus; the only land access to the town is via a coastal strip about {{convert|350|m}} wide, which was considerably narrower before the [[Land reclamation|reclamation of land]] from the sea during the 20th century.<ref name=\"Dennis\">[[#Dennis|Dennis]], pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's geography has thus given it considerable natural defensive advantages. It is virtually impossible to scale the eastern or northern sides of the Rock, which are either vertical or nearly so. To the south, the relatively flat area around [[Europa Point]] is surrounded by cliffs which are up to {{convert|30|m}} high. The western side is the only practicable area for a landing, but even here the steep slopes on which the town is built work to the advantage of a defender. These factors have given it an enormous military significance over the centuries.<ref name=\"Dennis\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Prehistory and ancient history}} Prehistory and ancient history==\n<!-- DO NOT change anchor without updating incoming link at: Original inhabitants of Gibraltar -->\n\n[[File:Neanderthal skull from Forbes' Quarry.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Three\u2014quarter view of the mostly intact skull of a Neanderthal female|\"[[Gibraltar 1|Gibraltar Woman]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 a Neanderthal who lived in Gibraltar some 50,000 years ago]]\n{{History of Gibraltar}}\nGibraltar's appearance in prehistory was very different.

It lacked easily accessible fresh water, fertile soil or a safe natural anchorage on the shoreline. Avienus cited the \"shallow draft and dense mud of the shore\" as reasons not to land there. Its geographical location, which later became its key strategic asset, was not a significant factor during the Classical period as the entrance to the Mediterranean was not contested by the states of the day.<ref name=\"Devenish-72\"/><ref name=Jackson-22>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 22.</ref>\n\nFor these reasons the ancients instead settled at the head of the bay in what is today known as the [[Campo de Gibraltar|''Campo'' (hinterland) of Gibraltar]].<ref name=Jackson-22/> The town of [[Carteia]], near the location of the modern Spanish town of [[San Roque, C\u00e1diz|San Roque]], was founded by the Phoenicians around 950 BC on the site of an early settlement of the native [[Turdetani]] people.<ref>[[#Shields|Shields]], p. ix.</ref> The Carthaginians took control of the town by 228 BC and it was captured by the Romans in 206 BC.<ref>[[#Collins|Collins]], p. 106.</ref> It subsequently became [[Pompey]]'s western base in his campaign of 67 BC against the pirates that menaced the Mediterranean Sea at the time.<ref>[[#Truver|Truver]], p. 161.</ref> Carteia appears to have been abandoned after the [[Vandals]] sacked it in 409 AD during their march through Roman [[Hispania]] to [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].<ref>[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 18.</ref> The region subsequently fell under the rule of the Christianised [[Visigoths]].<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 14.</ref>\n\n==Moorish rule (711\u20131309, 1333\u20131462)==\n{{main|Moorish Gibraltar}}\n[[File:Tower of Homage Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A square tower with gardens in the foreground and a connecting wall on the right\u2014hand side|The 14th-century Tower of Homage, the largest surviving fragment of Gibraltar's [[Moorish Castle]]]]\nBy 681 the armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] had expanded from their original homeland of [[Arabia]] to conquer North Africa, the Middle East and large parts of West Asia, bringing Islam in their wake and converting local peoples to the new religion. The [[Berbers]] of North Africa, called [[Moors]] by the Christians, thereby became Muslims. The Strait of Gibraltar became the frontier between Muslim North Africa and Christian [[Hispania]] and thus gained a new strategic significance. Hispania descended into civil war in the 8th century as rival Visigothic factions fought for control of the throne.

Gibraltar was renamed ''Jebel al-Fath'' (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist,<ref name=Hills-13/> and a fortified town named ''Medinat al-Fath'' (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\n\nIn the late thirteen and early fourteenth centuries the [[Crown of Castile]] fought with the [[Marinids]] of Morocco and the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrids]] of [[Emirate of Granada|Granada]] for control of the Strait of Gibraltar. This conflict ({{lang-es|link=no|la Cuesti\u00f3n del Estrecho}}) is a major chapter in the history of the Christian reconquest of Spain. Although no documentary account of Gibraltar is available for the period following the creation of Madinat al-Fath, there are reasons to believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of [[Tarifa]] in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that the Castilian king [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] would lay siege to [[Algeciras]] (though in the event, he did not do so) to hinder the Marinids' communications with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have made it necessary to set up a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would protect the [[rearguard]] of Algeciras and provided a fallback position if the town fell. At the same time, the heights of the Rock of Gibraltar provided an excellent vantage point for monitoring the activities of the Christian fleets in the Straits.<ref>[[#Harvey|Harvey]], p. 35.</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1309 when Gibraltar's defences were put to the test for the first time in the [[First Siege of Gibraltar]].

The metaphor was represented on the royal arms by a golden key hanging from the front gate of a battlemented fortress.

[[Barbary pirates]] from North Africa took advantage of the weak defences in September 1540 by mounting a major raid in which hundreds of Gibraltar's residents were taken as hostages or slaves. The [[Shrine of Our Lady of Europe]] was sacked and all its valuables were stolen.

The problem worsened significantly after 1606, when Spain expelled the [[Morisco]]s;\u2013 Muslims who had converted to Christianity. Many of the expellees were evacuated to North Africa via Gibraltar but ended up joining the pirate fleets, either as Christian slaves or reconverted Muslims, and raided as far afield as [[Cornwall]].<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 78\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 78.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Gibraltar 1607.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of a fleet of ships showing one ship exploding in flames, with men and debris flying in the air and other men in the water, jumping overboard or taking to lifeboats |''The Explosion of the Spanish Flagship during the [[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]]'' by [[Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen]] ]]\nThe threat of the Barbary pirates was soon joined by that of Spain's enemies in northern Europe.

The Spanish granted permission for the English fleet to use Gibraltar's port as a base for operations against the Barbary pirates, who were raiding the British and Irish coasts. Some in England had ambitions to turn the fleet against Spain rather than the Barbary coast. However, [[James VI and I|James I]] successfully resisted [[Parliament of England|Parliamentary]] pressure to declare war on Spain and the fleet returned to England.<ref name=\"Jackson-81\"/> After [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ascended the throne in 1625, a second English fleet was sent to the region with instructions to \"take or spoil a town\" on the Spanish coast. Gibraltar was one of the proposed targets on the basis that it was small, could easily be garrisoned, supplied and defended, and was in a highly strategic location. The English fleet instead attacked [[C\u00e1diz]] in the belief that its sacking would be more immediately profitable, but [[C\u00e1diz Expedition (1625)|the raid]] turned into a fiasco. The landing force looted the town's wine stores and was evacuated after four days of mass drunkenness without anything useful having been achieved.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe presence of Spain's enemies in the Straits prompted the Spanish king [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] to order Gibraltar's defences to be strengthened. A new [[South Mole, Gibraltar Harbour|mole]] and gun platforms were built, though the latter's usefulness was limited due to a lack of gunners. The town was an unsanitary, crowded place, which probably contributed to the outbreak in 1649 of an epidemic&nbsp;\u2013 reportedly [[Plague (disease)|plague]] but possibly [[typhoid fever|typhoid]]&nbsp;\u2013 which killed a quarter of the population.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 84.</ref> English fleets returned to Gibraltar in 1651\u201352 and again in 1654\u201355 as temporary allies of the Spanish against French and Dutch shipping in the Straits.<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 86\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 86.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gibraltar in 1654 (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Gibraltar'', 1654 by [[Jan Peeters I]]]]\nIn 1654, [[Oliver Cromwell]] decided to turn on Spain (which had been the first state to recognise the [[Commonwealth of England]]) and seize the island of [[Hispaniola]] to make it a base for English expansion in the Caribbean. To do so, two fleets were fitted out: one set out to America and another to the western Mediterranean with the ostensible objective of fighting the Barbary pirates. The fleet in the Caribbean failed to seize Hispaniola but took over [[Jamaica]] instead in May 1655. The fleet in the Mediterranean sailed off C\u00e1diz trying to intercept the Spanish treasure fleet with no success. With the arrival of the winter, the fleet went back to England. However, Spain did not declare [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654\u201360)|war on England]] until February 1656.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p.&nbsp;85\u201386.</ref> Shortly afterwards, a fleet of 49 English warships manned by 10,000 sailors and soldiers sailed through the Straits and reconnoitred Gibraltar. Although they lacked a viable landing force and took no action, Oliver Cromwell expressed interest in its capture: \"if possessed and made tenable by us, would it not be both an advantage to our trade, and an annoyance to the Spaniards, and enable us [to]&nbsp;... ease our own charge?\"<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 86\"/> In 1693, during the [[Nine Years' War]], in which Spain and England were allies, the remnants of an English-Dutch escort squadron under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Rooke]] took refuge at Gibraltar, pursued by the French, after losing the [[Battle of Lagos (1693)|Battle of Lagos Bay]].

The dispute over who should succeed him&nbsp;\u2013 the Bourbon Prince [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]], grandson of [[Louis XIV of France]], or the Habsburg Archduke [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Austria]]&nbsp;\u2013 soon plunged Europe into a major war. Louis XIV supported Philip. England, the Netherlands, Austria, [[Portugal]], Savoy and some of the German states supported Charles, fearing that Philip's accession would result in French domination of Europe and the Americas. In accordance with Charles II's will, Philip was proclaimed king as Philip V of Spain and allied his new kingdom with France. The following February, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] broke out when French forces arrived in the Spanish Netherlands and expelled the Dutch from the [[barrier town]]s. In May 1702, England's [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] formally declared war on France.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 89\u201391.</ref>\n\nSpain thus became a target for the Anglo-Dutch-Austrian alliance.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 91.</ref> The confederates' campaign was pursued by land and by sea. The main land offensive was pursued in the [[Low Countries]] by the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], while naval forces under the command of Admiral Sir George Rooke harassed French and Spanish shipping in the Atlantic. In 1703, Marlborough devised a plan under which his forces would launch a surprise attack against the French and their [[Bavaria]]n allies in the [[Danube]] basin while Rooke carried out a diversionary naval offensive in the Mediterranean.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 92.</ref> Rooke was instructed to attack French or Spanish coastal towns, though the choice of target was left to his discretion.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 93.</ref>\n\nWhen Rooke arrived in the region several targets were considered. An attempt to incite the inhabitants of [[Barcelona]] to revolt against Philip V failed, and a plan to assault the French naval base at [[Toulon]] was abandoned, and an earlier attempt to take [[Battle of C\u00e1diz (1702)|C\u00e1diz]] had failed. Casting around for an easier target, Rooke decided to attack Gibraltar for three principal reasons: it was poorly garrisoned and fortified, it would be of major strategic value to the war effort, and its capture might encourage the inhabitants of southern Spain to reject Philip.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 94.</ref>\n\n[[Capture of Gibraltar|The attack]] was launched on 1 August 1704 as a combined operation between the naval force under Rooke's command and a force of Dutch and English marines under the command of [[Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt]] and Captain [[Edward Whitaker]] of [[HMS Dorsetshire (1694)|HMS ''Dorsetshire'']].<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 96.</ref> After a heavy naval bombardment on 2 August, the marines launched a pincer attack on the town, advancing south from the isthmus and north from Europa Point.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 97.</ref> Gibraltar's defenders were well stocked with food and ammunition but were heavily outnumbered and outgunned. The Spanish position was untenable and on the morning of 4 August, the governor, [[Diego de Salinas]], agreed to surrender.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 98.</ref>\n\nThe [[s:Terms of surrender of the Spanish authorities of Gibraltar in 1704|terms of surrender]] made it clear that Gibraltar had been taken in the name of Charles III of Spain, described in the terms as \"legitimate Lord and King\". The inhabitants and garrison of Gibraltar were promised freedom of religion and the maintenance of existing rights if they wished to stay, on condition that they swore an oath of loyalty to Charles as King of Spain. As had happened two years previously in the raid on C\u00e1diz, the discipline of the landing forces soon broke down. There were numerous incidents of rape, all Catholic churches but one (the Parish Church of St. Mary the Crowned, now the [[Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned|Cathedral]]) were desecrated or converted into military storehouses, and religious symbols such as the statue of [[Our Lady of Europe]] were damaged and destroyed. Angry Spanish inhabitants took violent reprisals against the occupiers. English and Dutch soldiers and sailors were attacked and killed, and their bodies were thrown into wells and cesspits.<ref name=Jackson-99>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 99.</ref>\n\nWhen the Spanish garrison marched out on 7 August almost all of the inhabitants, some 4,000 people in total, evacuated the town.

Many settled nearby in the ruins of Algeciras or around [[Santa Mar\u00eda la Coronada Church|an old hermitage]] at the head of the bay in the expectation of a prompt return. They took with them the records of the city council including Gibraltar's banner and royal warrant. In time the refugee settlement at the hermitage developed into the town of San Roque. It was regarded by the Spanish, as Philip V put it in 1706, as being the \"City of Gibraltar resident in its Campo\". A small population of around seventy (mainly neutral [[Genoa|Genoese]] people) stayed behind in Gibraltar.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 101.</ref>\n\nThe Grand Alliance's control of Gibraltar was challenged on 24 August when a French fleet entered the Straits.

The French withdrew to Toulon without attempting to assault Gibraltar.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 102.</ref> In early September a Franco-Spanish army arrived outside Gibraltar and prepared for [[Twelfth Siege of Gibraltar|a siege which they commenced on 9 October]].

The British commandant, Major General [[John Shrimpton]], was appointed by Charles as Gibraltar's governor in 1705 on the advice of Queen Anne.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 113.</ref> The Queen subsequently declared Gibraltar a [[free port]] at the insistence of the Sultan of Morocco, though she had no formal authority to do so. Shrimpton was replaced in 1707 by Colonel [[Roger Elliott]], who was replaced in turn by Brigadier [[Thomas Stanwix]] in 1711; this time the appointments were made directly by London with no claim of authority from Charles. Stanwix was ordered to expel all foreign troops from Gibraltar to secure its status as an exclusively British possession but failed to evict the Dutch, apparently not considering them \"foreign\".<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 114.</ref>\n\nThe War of the Spanish Succession was finally settled in 1713 by a series of treaties and agreements. Under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which was signed on 13 July 1713 and brought together a number of sub-treaties and agreements, Philip V was accepted by Britain and Austria as King of Spain in exchange for guarantees that the crowns of France and Spain would not be unified. Various territorial exchanges were agreed: although Philip V retained the Spanish overseas empire, he ceded the [[Southern Netherlands]], [[Naples]], Milan, and [[Sardinia]] to Austria; [[Sicily]] and some Milanese lands to [[Savoy]]; and [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]] to Great Britain. In addition he granted the British the exclusive right to non-Spanish [[history of slavery|slave trading]] in Spanish America for thirty years, the so-called ''[[asiento]]''. With regard to Gibraltar ([[:s:Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht between Spain and Great Britain#ARTICLE X|Article X]]), the town, fortifications and port (but not the hinterland) were ceded to Britain \"for ever, without any exception or impediment whatsoever.\" The treaty also stipulated that if Britain was ever to dispose of Gibraltar it would first have to offer the territory to Spain.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 113, 333\u2013334.</ref><ref name=\"Abulafia2011 497\">[[#Abulafia|Abulafia]], p. 47.</ref>\n\n==British rule (1713\u2013present)==\n\n===Consolidation and sieges===\nDespite its later importance to Britain, Gibraltar was initially seen by the British Government as more of a bargaining counter than a strategic asset.

Spain responded the following year by constructing a line of fortifications across the upper end of the peninsula, cutting off Gibraltar from its hinterland. The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as ''La L\u00ednea de Contravalaci\u00f3n'' (the Lines of [[Investment (military)|Contravallation]]), were later to give their name to the modern town of [[La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n]].<ref name=\"Jackson-139\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 139.</ref> Gibraltar was effectively blockaded by land but was able to rely on trade with Morocco for food and other supplies.<ref name=\"Jackson-140\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 140.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's civilian population increased steadily through the century to form a disparate mixture of Britons, Genoese, Jews, Spaniards and Portuguese.

The British Government's attempt to levy new taxes on the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[British America]] led to the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] in 1776. Spain declared war on Britain and [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|started the Anglo-Spanish War]] and then tried to recover Gibraltar with French aid.<ref name=\"Jackson-150\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]] lasted from 24 June 1779 to 7 February 1783 and remains one of the longest [[siege]]s endured by the [[British Armed Forces]], as well as being one of the longest continuous sieges in history.  A combined Spanish and French fleet [[blockade]]d Gibraltar from the sea, while on the land side an enormous army was engaged in constructing [[fortification|forts]], [[redoubt]]s, [[trench warfare|entrenchments]], and [[artillery battery|batteries]] from which to attack Gibraltar. The Spanish committed increasing number of troops and ships to the siege, postponing the planned invasion of England by the [[Armada of 1779]].  The first relief of the siege came in the spring of 1780 when [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral George Rodney]] captured a [[Action of 8 January 1780|Spanish convoy off Cape Finesterre]] and defeated a Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]], delivering reinforcements of 1,052 men and an abundance of supplies.\n\nThe British defenders continued to resist every attempt to capture Gibraltar by assault but supplies again began to run low.  On 12 April 1781 Vice Admiral [[George Darby]]'s squadron of 29 ships of the line escorting 100 store ships from England laden for Gibraltar entered the bay. The Spanish fleet was unable to intercept Darby's relief. The Spanish, frustrated by this failure, began a barrage of the town, causing great panic and terror among the civilian population.<ref name=\"Bradford1972_gs\">{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Ernle Dusgate Selby |date=1972 |title=Gibraltar: the history of a fortress |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-UjAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=16 April 2011}} ''To the citizen of the 20th Century, accustomed or the civilian casualties in war, and dulled to the annihilation of whole cities (or even nations), the horrified reaction of Gibraltar's garrison to the shelling of the town and its inhabitants may seem a trifle na\u00efve.

Unable to starve the garrison out, the French and Spanish attempted further attacks by land and sea. The night before the Grand Attack on 27 November 1781, the British garrison filed silently out of their defence works and made a surprise [[sortie]], routing the besieging infantry in their trenches and postponed the grand assault on The Rock for some time.\n\nOn 13 September 1782 the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon allies]] launched their great attack; 5190 fighting men, both French and Spanish, aboard ten of the newly engineered '[[Floating battery|floating batteries]]' with 138<ref>Monti, p. 140.</ref> heavy guns, as well as 18 ships of the line, 40 Spanish gunboats and 20 bomb-vessels<ref name=\"Monti p138\">Monti, p. 138.</ref> with a total of 30,000 sailors and marines.

A total of 34 ships of the line escorted 31 transport ships which delivered supplies, food, and ammunition. The fleet also brought the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers|25th]], [[59th (2nd Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot|59th]], and [[97th Regiment of Foot (1780)|97th]] regiments of foot bringing the total number of the garrison to over 7,000<ref>Syrett, p. 104\u2013105.</ref><ref>Chartrand, p. 23.</ref> Howe then sailed out and fought [[Battle of Cape Spartel|an indecisive battle]] with the combined allied fleet before withdrawing to Britain in line with his orders.\n\nThe siege was continued for some months longer, but in the spring of 1783 a preliminary peace agreement brought the cessation of hostilities. Finally, in February 1783 the siege was lifted.  The outcome of the Great Siege made it politically impossible for the British government to again consider trading away Gibraltar, even though King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] warned that it would be the source \"of another war, or at least of a constant lurking enmity\" and expressed his wish \"if possible to be rid of Gibraltar&nbsp;...

Britain's loss of North American colonies in 1776 led to much of her trade being redirected to new markets in [[India]] and the [[East Indies]]. The favoured route to the east was via [[Egypt]], even before the [[Suez Canal]] had been built, and Gibraltar was the first British port reached by ships heading there. The new maritime traffic gave Gibraltar a greatly increased role as a trading port. At the same time, it was a haven in the western Mediterranean from the disruption of the Napoleonic Wars. Many of the new immigrants were Genoese people who had fled Napoleon's annexation of the old [[Republic of Genoa]].<ref name=\"Jackson-181\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 181.</ref> By 1813 nearly a third of the population consisted of Genoese and Italians.

The damage caused by the Great Siege had long since been repaired, but Gibraltar was still essentially a medieval town in its layout and narrow streets. A lack of proper drainage had been a major contributing factor in the epidemics that had frequently ravaged the fortress. Don implemented improved sanitation and drainage as well as introducing street lighting, rebuilding [[St Bernard's Hospital]] to serve the civilian population and initiating the construction of the [[Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Gibraltar|Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]] to serve Gibraltar's Protestant civilians.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], pp. 161\u2013162.</ref> For the first time, civilians began to have a say in the running of Gibraltar. An Exchange and Commercial Library was founded in 1817, with the Exchange Committee initially focused on furthering the interests of merchants based in the fortress. The Committee evolved into a local civilian voice in government, although it had no real powers.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 162.</ref> A City Council was established in 1821, and in 1830 Gibraltar became a [[Crown colony]]. In the same year, the [[Gibraltar Police Force]] was established, modelled on London's pioneering [[Metropolitan Police Service]],<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 163.</ref> and [[Court system of Gibraltar|a Supreme Court]] was set up to try civil, criminal and mixed cases.<ref name=\"Jackson-229\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 229.</ref>\n\nThe economic importance of Gibraltar changed following the invention of [[steamboat|steamships]]; the first one to reach Gibraltar's harbour arrived there in 1823.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 166.</ref> The advent of steamships caused a major shift in trade patterns in the Mediterranean. Transshipment, which had previously been Gibraltar's principal economic mainstay, was largely replaced by the much less lucrative work of servicing visiting steamships through coaling, victualling and ferrying of goods. Although Gibraltar became a key coaling station where British steamships refuelled on the way to [[Alexandria]] or [[Cape Horn]], the economic changes resulted in a prolonged depression that lasted until near the end of the century.<ref name=\"Jackson-242\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 242.</ref> The demand for labour for coaling was such that Gibraltar instituted the practice of relying on large numbers of imported Spanish workers. A shanty town sprang up on the site of the old Spanish fortifications just across the border, which became the workers' town of La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n. The poor economy meant that Gibraltar's population barely changed between 1830 and 1880, but it was still relatively more prosperous than the severely impoverished south of Spain. As a consequence, La L\u00ednea's population doubled over the same period and then doubled again in the following 20 years.<ref>[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 381.</ref>\n[[File:Frederick Leeds Edridge 1833 Castle Street.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Painting of a street scene showing people and pack animals going up and down a steep street, with several women wearing the traditional red cloak of Gibraltar|Castle Street, Gibraltar, by [[Frederick Leeds Edridge]], 1833]]\nVisiting Gibraltar in the mid-19th century, the English writer [[Richard Ford (writer)|Richard Ford]] wrote in his ''[[A Handbook for Travellers in Spain|Handbook for Travellers in Spain]]'' that \"the differences of nations and costumes are very curious: a motley masquerade is held in this halfway house between Europe, Asia, and Africa, where every man appears in his own dress and speaks his own language.

The problem arose after Spain imposed tariffs on foreign manufactured goods in a bid to protect Spain's own fledgling industrial enterprises. Tobacco was also heavily taxed, providing one of the government's principal sources of revenue. The inevitable result was that Gibraltar, where cheap tobacco and goods were readily available, became a centre of intensive smuggling activity.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 172.</ref> The depressed state of the economy caused smuggling to become a mainstay of Gibraltar's trade;<ref name=\"Jackson-242\"/> the mid-19th-century Irish traveller Martin Haverty described Gibraltar as \"the grand smuggling depot for Spain\".<ref name=\"Haverty-219\"/> General Sir [[Robert Gardiner (British Army officer)|Robert Gardiner]], who served as Governor between 1848 and 1855, described the daily scene in a letter to British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]:\n\n{{quote|From the first early opening of the gates there is to be seen a stream of Spanish men, women and children, horses and a few caleches, passing into the town where they remain moving about from shop to shop until about noon.

The emergence of the Gibraltarians as a distinct group owed much to the pressure on housing in the territory and the need to control the numbers of the civilian population, as Gibraltar was still first and foremost a military fortress. Two [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] of 1873 and 1885 stipulated that no child of alien parent could be born in Gibraltar, no foreigners could claim a right of residence and that only Gibraltar-born inhabitants were entitled to reside there; everyone else needed permits, unless they were employees of the British Crown. In addition to the 14,244 Gibraltarians, there were also 711 British people, 695 Maltese and 960 from other British dominions.<ref name=\"Jackson-248\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 248.</ref> There were 1,869 Spaniards (of whom 1,341 were female) with smaller numbers of Portuguese, Italians, French and Moroccans.<ref name=\"Jackson-249\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 249.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar at war and peace===\n[[File:Gibraltar Harbour scene, February 1909.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A fleet of warships lined up in a harbour with thick clouds of smoke coming out of their funnels|The United States' [[Great White Fleet]] visiting Gibraltar harbour in February 1909]]\nBy the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, Gibraltar's future as a British colony was in serious doubt. Its economic value was diminishing, as a new generation of steamships with a much longer range no longer needed to stop there to refuel en route to more distant ports. Its military value was also increasingly in question due to advances in military technology. New long-range guns firing high-explosive shells could easily reach Gibraltar from across the bay or in the Spanish hinterland, while the development of [[torpedo]]es meant that ships at anchor in the bay were also vulnerable.<ref name=\"Jackson-256\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 255.</ref> The garrison could hold out for a long time, but if the Spanish coast was held by an enemy, Gibraltar could not be resupplied in the fashion that had saved it in the Great Siege 120 years earlier.<ref name=\"Bradford-169\">[[#Bradford|Bradford]], p. 169.</ref>\n\nA Spanish proposal to swap Gibraltar for [[Ceuta]] on the other side of the Strait was considered but was eventually rejected.<ref name=\"Quiroga\">[[#Quiroga|Quiroga]], page 39</ref> It was ultimately decided that Gibraltar's strategic position as a naval base outweighed its potential vulnerability from the landward side. From 1889, the [[Royal Navy]] was greatly expanded and both Gibraltar and Malta were equipped with new, torpedo-proof harbours and expanded, modernised dockyards.<ref name=\"Jackson-256\"/> The works at Gibraltar were carried out by some 2,200 men at the huge cost of \u00a35&nbsp;million (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.005|1898|2013|r=1}}}}&nbsp;billion in 2013 prices).<ref name=\"Jackson-257\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 257.</ref> Under the reforming leadership of [[First Sea Lord]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral John \"Jacky\" Fisher]], Gibraltar became the base for the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]].<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 189.</ref> In the British public's imagination, Gibraltar was seen as \"a symbol of British naval power [and] a symbol of the empire which has been built and, more than the British lion or even [[John Bull]] himself, has come to represent Britain's power and prestige across the world.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Gibraltar \u2013 Vital Point in War|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fjJlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NIkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2378,24256&dq=windmill-hill+gibraltar&hl=en|work=The Vancouver Sun|page=4|date=1 August 1940}}</ref>\n\nThe value of the naval base was soon apparent when the [[First World War]] broke out in August 1914. Only a few minutes after the declaration of war went into effect at midnight on 3/4 August, a German liner was captured by a torpedo boat from Gibraltar, followed by three more enemy ships the following day.<ref name=\"Hills-398\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 398.</ref> Although Gibraltar was well away from the main battlefields of the war \u2013 Spain remained neutral and the Mediterranean was not contested as it was in the Second World War&nbsp;\u2013 it played an important role in the Allied fight against the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|German U-boat campaign]]. The naval base was heavily used by Allied warships for resupplying and repairs. The Bay of Gibraltar was also used as a forming-up point for Allied convoys, while German U-boats stalked the Strait looking for targets. On two occasions, Gibraltar's guns unsuccessfully fired on two U-boats travelling through the Strait.<ref name=\"Jackson-264\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 264.</ref> Anti-submarine warfare was in its infancy and it proved impossible to prevent U-boats operating through the Strait. Only two days before the end of the war, on 9 November 1918, [[SM UB-50|SM ''UB-50'']] torpedoed and sank the British [[battleship]] [[HMS Britannia (1904)|HMS ''Britannia'']] off [[Cape Trafalgar]] to the west of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-265\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 265.</ref>\n\nThe restoration of peace inevitably meant a reduction in military expenditure, but this was more than offset by a large increase in liner and cruise ship traffic to Gibraltar. British liners travelling to and from [[India]] and South Africa customarily stopped there, as did French, Italian and Greek liners travelling to and from America. Oil bunkering became a major industry alongside coaling. An airfield was established in 1933 on the isthmus linking Gibraltar to Spain. Civil society was reformed as well; in 1921 an Executive Council and an elected City Council were established to advise the governor, in the first step towards self-government of the territory.<ref name=\"Jackson-268\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 268.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in July 1936 presented Gibraltar with major security concerns, as it was initially on the front lines of the conflict. The ultimately successful rebellion led by General [[Francisco Franco]] broke out across the Strait in Morocco, and the [[Spanish Republic (1931\u20131939)|Spanish Republican]] government sought on several occasions to regain control of the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]]-controlled area around Algeciras. Although Gibraltar was not directly affected by the fighting, the war caused significant disruption. An undetermined number of Spanish refugees, perhaps as many as 10,000 persons, fled to Gibraltar, resulting in severe overcrowding.<ref name=\"Stockey-93\">[[#Stockey|Stockey]], p. 93.</ref><ref name=\"Alexander206\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 206.</ref> A Non-Intervention Patrol was mounted by the Royal Navy, operating from Gibraltar, to prevent foreign military aid reaching the belligerents in Spain.

The situation changed drastically after April 1940 when [[Battle of France|Germany invaded France]], with [[Italian invasion of France|Italy joining the invasion]] in June 1940. The British Government feared that Spain would also enter the war and it was decided to [[evacuation of the Gibraltarian civilian population during World War II|evacuate the entire civilian population of Gibraltar]] in May 1940.<ref name=\"Jackson-271\"/> Most went to the United Kingdom and others to [[Madeira]] and [[Jamaica]], while some made their own way to [[Tangier]] and Spain. An intensive programme of tunnelling and refortification was undertaken; over {{convert|30|miles|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} of tunnels were dug in the Rock, and anti-aircraft batteries were installed in numerous locations in the territory. A new and powerful naval group called [[Force H]] was established at Gibraltar to control the entrance to the Mediterranean and support Allied forces in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.<ref name=\"Jackson-276\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 276.</ref> The airfield, which was now designated [[RAF North Front]], was also extended using soil from the tunnelling works so that it could accommodate bomber aircraft being ferried to North Africa.<ref name=\"Jackson-286\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 286.</ref> The garrison was greatly expanded, reaching a peak of 17,000 in 1943 with another 20,000 sailors and airmen accommodated in Gibraltar at the same time.<ref name=\"Jackson-293\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 293.</ref>\n\nDuring the Battle of the Atlantic, Gibraltar played a key role. The [[Convoy#World War II|Ocean Convoy System]] adopted by Britain after the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in June 1940 ran on two routes \u2013 an east\u2013west route between the UK and North America, and a north\u2013south route between the UK, Gibraltar and [[Freetown]] in British-ruled [[Sierra Leone]].<ref>[[#Grove|Grove]], p. 30.</ref> Even before the war, Gibraltar had been designated as one of the main assembly points for convoys heading inbound to Europe.<ref>[[#Baptiste|Baptiste]], p. 7.</ref> From late 1942, Gibraltar was the destination of the Central Atlantic convoy route between the United States and the Mediterranean in support of Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and elsewhere in the region.<ref>[[#Offley|Offley]], p. 371.</ref> A huge number of Allied troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between Gibraltar and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to Gibraltar.<ref>[[#Morison|Morison]], p. 250.</ref>\n\nGibraltar was directly attacked, both overtly and covertly, on several occasions during the war. [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] aircraft carried out bombing attacks in 1940 after the surprise attack of their fleet by the royal navy and there were sporadic raids from Italian and German long-range aircraft, though the damage caused was not significant.<ref name=\"Jackson-281\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 281.</ref> Franco's position changed subtly from one of neutrality to \"non-belligerence\",<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 11.</ref> which in practice meant allowing the Axis powers to operate covertly against Gibraltar from Spanish territory.

The immediate problem after [[VJ Day]] was a lack of shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to the southern end of the peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.<ref name=\"Jackson-296\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 296.</ref>\n\nIn the war's aftermath, Gibraltar took decisive steps towards implementing civilian self-governance over most issues of public policy. The [[Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights]] (AACR), led by Gibraltarian lawyer [[Joshua Hassan]], won all of the seats in the first post-war City Council elections in 1945. Women were given the right to vote in 1947, and in 1950 a Legislative Council was established.<ref name=\"Alexander-235\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 235.</ref> A two-party system had emerged by 1955 with the creation of the [[Commonwealth Party (Gibraltar)|Commonwealth Party]] as a rival to the AACR.

The old title of \"Colony of Gibraltar\" was dropped and the territory was renamed as the City of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Alexander-241\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 241.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's post-war relationship with Spain was marred by an intensification of the long-running dispute over the territory's sovereignty. Although Spain had not attempted to use military force to regain Gibraltar since 1783, the question of sovereignty was still present. Disputes over smuggling and the sea frontier between Gibraltar and Spain had repeatedly caused diplomatic tensions during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Hills-375\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 375.</ref> The neutral zone between Spain and Gibraltar had also been a cause of disputes during the 19th and 20th centuries. This originally had been an undemarcated strip of sand on the isthmus between the British and Spanish lines of fortifications, about {{convert|1|km}} wide&nbsp;\u2013 the distance of a cannon shot in 1704. Over the years, however, Britain took control of most of the neutral zone, much of which is now occupied by Gibraltar's airport. This expansion provoked repeated protests from Spain.<ref name=\"Jackson-250\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 250.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gibraltar border 1977.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Two women standing at a closed line of gates, with the British and Spanish flags flying on separate poles on either side.|The closed gates at the border between Gibraltar and Spain, 1977]]\nSpain's push to regain sovereignty over Gibraltar was fuelled by the [[decolonization|decolonisation]] agenda of the United Nations, which had been initiated in 1946. In that year, Britain had listed Gibraltar among other \"Overseas Dependent Territories\" in conjunction with the drive towards decolonisation, but it was not appreciated at the time that Gibraltar was in a unique position; due to the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, it could only be British or Spanish and could not gain independence.<ref name=\"Jackson-303\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 303.</ref> Franco's government calculated that Britain would be willing to give up an expensive possession that no longer had a great deal of military value,<ref name=\"Jackson-294\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 294.</ref> but this turned out to be a fundamental misjudgement. The British government followed a policy of allowing its colonies to become self-governing entities before giving them the option of independence. Almost all took it, choosing to become independent republics. That option was not available to Gibraltar under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, which required that if Britain ever relinquished control it was to be handed back to Spain.<ref name=\"Jackson-295\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 295.</ref> The Gibraltarians strongly opposed this and organised [[1967 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum|a referendum in September 1967]] in which 12,138 voters opted to remain with Britain and only 44 supported union with Spain.<ref name=\"Alexander-241\"/> Spain dismissed the outcome of the referendum, calling the city's inhabitants \"pseudo-Gibraltarians\"<ref name=\"Jackson-306\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 306.</ref> and stating that the \"real\" Gibraltarians were the descendants of the Spanish inhabitants who had resettled elsewhere in the region over 250 years earlier.<ref name=\"Alexander-237\"/>\n\nThe dispute initially took the form of symbolic protests and a campaign by Spanish diplomats and the state-controlled media. From 1954, Spain imposed increasingly stringent restrictions on trade and the movements of vehicles and people across the border with Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-300\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 300.</ref> Further restrictions were imposed in 1964,<ref name=\"Jackson-308\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 308.</ref> and in 1966 the frontier was closed to vehicles.  The following year, Spain closed its airspace to aircraft taking off or landing at [[Gibraltar International Airport]]. In 1969, after the passing of the [[Gibraltar Constitution Order 1969|Gibraltar Constitution Order]], to which Spain strongly objected, the frontier was closed completely and Gibraltar's telecommunications links through Spain were cut.<ref name=\"Jackson-316\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 316.</ref>\n\nThe Spanish decision had major consequences not only for the political relationship between Spain and the United Kingdom, but\nfor the people of Gibraltar, many of whom had relatives or homes in Spain. As one of the Gibraltarians who suffered the closure of the frontier explains:\n\n{{quote|The saddest sight was seeing people behind the wire fences on both sides of the land frontier yelling at the top of their voices across the wide dividing space to enquire about the state of relatives, as telephone communications had been cut by the Spaniards. Local housewives with Spanish relatives in the Campo area kept their radios tuned to the nearby Spanish stations for news of family members who were gravely ill. In critical cases the parties concerned would rush to Spain via Tangiers but unfortunately sometimes the patient was dead and buried by the time they arrived. The Spanish authorities would not allow access across the land frontier even on compassionate grounds.<ref>[[#Levey|Levey]], p. 35.</ref>}}\n\nFranco's death in 1975 led to the beginnings of diplomatic movement between Britain and Spain on the Gibraltar issue, though not immediately.
