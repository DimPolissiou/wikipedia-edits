The game prominently features a number of popular [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[Rock music|rock]] songs in its [[soundtrack]], hence the game's title. The game was [[porting|ported]] to the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2003.\n\n''Rock n' Roll Racing'' was initially developed as ''RPMII'', a sequel to the company's SNES game ''[[RPM Racing]]''.  At the end of the project, Interplay marketing added licensed music and changed the name to ''Rock n' Roll Racing''. It is also similar in [[gameplay]] to ''[[Racing Destruction Set]]'' where it got its logic/AI engine and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[R.C. Pro-Am]]'' developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] in 1988.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game pits four racers against each other, with up to two of them being [[Player character|player-controlled]] from a colourful collection of [[comic book]] inspired humans and aliens and the rest being [[game artificial intelligence|AI opponents]]; 'Rip' and 'Shred' who appear in all races plus a third character unique to each planet/level in [[Single-player video game|one player mode]].  Each race consists of four laps around tracks viewed from an [[isometric projection|isometric]] perspective, which enables players to discern the presence of frequent sloping sections spread throughout the game's various tracks.  In addition to navigating the turns, racers must also maneuver hills and dips without falling or jumping over the guard rail at the track's edge.\n\n[[Image:RockNRollRacing2.png|256px|thumb|left|A race on the SNES version.]]\n\nWhile it is a racing game, there is heavy emphasis on attacking competitor's vehicles; since the cars always reappear with full [[health (gaming)|health]] just a few seconds after blowing up, the only \"harm\" done is falling behind in the race.  Players are rewarded with a monetary \"attack bonus\" each time they provide the finishing blow against another car using their forward or rear weapons (and a similar \"lapping bonus\" when they gain a full one-lap lead on an opponent during the race).  In accordance with the continual destruction and restoration of the racing vehicles, the tracks are littered with [[Anti-tank mine|mines]] and health [[power-up]]s, as well as money power-ups.  Other hazards include oil slicks, snow drifts, and lava, depending on the planet hosting the race.\n\nPlayers are updated on the race by commentator \"Loudmouth Larry\" (Larry \"Supermouth\" Huffman), who makes enthusiastic comments like \"The stage is set, the green flag drops!\" (or \"Let the carnage ''begin!''\"), and \"(player name) is about to blow!\" at appropriate moments during the race.\n\nBetween races, players can spend the money they have earned on more advanced equipment for their vehicle (engines, tires, shocks, and shielding) or on increasing their capacity for the frontal weapon (energy blasts or missiles), rear weapon (slip sauce or mines), and [[turbo]] boost (jump jets or [[Nitrous oxide engine|nitro]] boosts), each of which can max out at seven.  Despite their limited capacity, every vehicle will have its weapon and boost charges replenished at the completion of each lap in a race.  Racers can also buy more advanced vehicle models; however, all equipment and weapons upgrades are lost when a new vehicle is purchased.\n\nThe first three drivers to complete a race are awarded both money and points according to the final standings.  Points are required for advancement to the next racing division or the next planet, with two divisions on each planet.  A player who has not obtained enough points during a division's racing season must repeat the division, again starting with zero points, but all changes to the player's money and car remain in effect.  In two-player mode, when only one player has sufficient points, the character in charge of advancement asks \"Leave your loser friend behind?\", allowing the leading player to continue alone by removing the other player from the game.  The dropped player can continue from that point later by using their most recent [[Password (video games)|password]], once the game is [[Reset button|reset]].\n\n=== Music === \nThe songs were uncredited but included:\n\n*[[Bad to the Bone]] by [[George Thorogood and the Destroyers]]\n*[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]] by [[Deep Purple]]\n*[[Paranoid (Black Sabbath song)|Paranoid]] by [[Black Sabbath]]\n*[[Peter Gunn (song)|Peter Gunn]] by [[Henry Mancini]]\n*[[Born to be Wild]] by [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]]\n*[[Radar Love]] by [[Golden Earring]] (Sega Genesis only)\n\n=== Passwords ===\n[[password (video games)|Password]]s are given out at the beginning of each new \"racing season\" (each planet has its own definition of how many races make up a season, but early advancement will automatically start a new season), and they are located at the bottom of the F/X screen (accessible from the menu between races).  These passwords are a complex code, consisting of three 4-digit sections, and they dictate everything about the players' progress: the character used, the vehicle type and color, weapons and parts upgrades, racing planet and division, difficulty setting, and money.  The [[Game Boy Advance]] version of the game uses an [[EEPROM]] chip to [[saved game|save]] the player's progress [[Wiktionary:in lieu|in lieu]] of the password system.\n\nThe password codes only allow the player to save a maximum of $999,990 (six digits); if there are more than six figures in the bank account, the password truncates the leftmost digits over six (e.g. if there's $1,002,000 when the player quits, there will be only $2,000 when using the password to continue later).  Due to the two-player password function, it's possible to \"cheat\" by entering the same password for both players or by entering passwords for players who were at entirely different points in the game.  The password with the lowest difficulty setting and on the earliest planet and racing division will be used as the basis for play from then on, which allows for a Warrior-skill character with a maxed-out vehicle to race against Rookie-class [[game artificial intelligence|AI]]s in the Rookie skill mode.\n\nThough a password generator [[QBASIC]] program exists, the passwords it creates often result in a glitch, causing the player to race on glitchy planets\u2014that exist only as a bug and can crash the game\u2014after racing on Inferno.  In the Rookie skill mode, however, they work perfectly, as long as one doesn't try to take the character beyond the third planet using the password.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamewinners.com/snes/RockNRollRacing.htm | title=Rock 'n' Roll Racing cheats, hints, FAQs | publisher=GameWinners.com | accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref>\n\nA second password generator has been written in [[JavaScript]] which limits the available planets to reflect the chosen skill mode while retaining the ability to customize any other aspect of the data stored in the password.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.barcodebattler.co.uk/SORR/pwGen2up.htm | title=Rock n' Roll Racing Password Generator | publisher=BarcodeBattler.co.uk | accessdate=2013-05-31}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nA [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] version of ''Rock n' Roll Racing'' was announced to be in development and slated to be published by Interplay during [[E3 1995]], however, this version was never released for unknown reasons.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_3_Issue_07#page/n42/mode/1up|title=E-3 The Biggest And Best Electronic Entertainment Show Ever! \u2013 '95 Next Generation Software Listing|volume=3|magazine=[[GameFan]]|issue=7|date=July 1995|page=41|access-date=2019-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129120834/https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_3_Issue_07#page/n42/mode/1up|archive-date=2018-11-29|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Blizzard released an [[Adobe Shockwave]]-based demo version of the GBA port featuring one track on its website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/rock-n-roll-racing-demo-online/1100-6030451/|title=Rock 'N Roll Racing demo online|last=Calvert|first=Justin|date=23 June 2003|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a demo version of the game featuring three tracks was added to [[Battle.net]], emulated through [[ZSNES]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/216877/Rock_n_Roll_Racing_The_Lost_Vikings_now_free_on_Battlenet.php|title=Rock n' Roll Racing, The Lost Vikings now free on Battle.net|last=Wawro|first=Alex|date=2 May 2014|work=[[Gamasutra]]|publisher=Think Services|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> This version has all rock music tracks changed to simple MIDI music, because the music license expired.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[GamePro]]'' gave the Genesis version a mixed review.

During this time, Nevada Southern University also adopted the southern \"Rebel\" athletics moniker and a mascot dressed in a southern Confederate uniform named Beauregard. The popular reasoning behind such a controversial moniker and mascot is that they did it to oppose the northern Union traditions and symbols of their northern rival, the University of Nevada. Soon, protests from NSU/UNLV students forced a slight change to their Confederate mascot, but the \"Rebels\" moniker remains to this day.

SEB achieved this rating by using recycled glass, steel, concrete, and wood. More than 60% of the leftover construction materials were recycled. The roof of SEB was made to reflect 92% of sunlight. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed into the building, so reduces energy needed to cool the building. Incoming air to SEB is also cooled through evaporation so the need for air conditioning is reduced. High-performance window glazing also allows light to come in while keeping the building insulated. Occupancy sensors allow lights to automatically turn off when a room is not occupied, saving electricity. Low-flow sinks, toilets, and showers, as well as a drip irrigation system for the native desert landscape, reduce water usage by 42%. SEB also uses a reclaimed water system that captures wastewater, providing 750 gallons of water a day that are used to flush toilets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unlv.edu/seb/features |title=Features &#124; Science and Engineering Building &#124; University of Nevada, Las Vegas |publisher=Unlv.edu |accessdate=2013-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026012640/http://www.unlv.edu/seb/features |archive-date=2013-10-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Greenspun College of Urban Affairs building of UNLV received a LEED Gold rating in April 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgbcnv.org/leed-in-nevada |title=USGBC Nevada - LEED in Nevada |publisher=Usgbcnv.org |accessdate=2013-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207161138/http://usgbcnv.org/leed-in-nevada |archivedate=2013-12-07 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, UNLV received the Cashman Good Government Award for the campus' sustainability measures for \"maintaining consistent energy costs despite substantial campus growth,\" saving nearly $11 million from 2001-2009.

The men's basketball team is referred to as the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|Runnin' Rebels]] and the men's baseball team is referred to as the Hustlin' Rebels. The Rebels are a founding member of the [[Mountain West Conference]], in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] Division I. The only exceptions are the UNLV men's soccer team and swim and dive team, which compete in the [[Western Athletic Conference]].\n\nThe school's official colors of scarlet and gray can be traced to 1958, when UNLV adopted as mascot a wolf wearing a Confederate uniform. Scarlet and gray were traditional colors of the Confederacy with its gray uniforms and red-based flag. UNLV's mascot is Hey Reb, the toned-down version of the original mascot named Beauregard, which was a wolf character dressed in [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] hat and uniform. UNLV's Hey Reb mascot made his debut in 1983. He received his first makeover in 1997 and second in 2009. Named one of 12 All-American Mascots, he competed for the title of 2004 Capital One Mascot of the Year and made a strong showing by coming in second in online voting. No stranger to national television, Hey Reb has also appeared in two memorable ESPN SportsCenter commercials.\n\nUNLV has many traditions in its athletic programs. Each year, the men's football team plays the [[Nevada Wolf Pack football|Nevada Wolf Pack]] in a football game called the Battle for Nevada. The trophy for that game is the [[Fremont Cannon]]. Built by the [[Kennecott Utah Copper|Kennecott Copper]] Corp., Nevada Mines Division, the cannon is valued at more than $10,000 and is considered one of the best and loudest, symbols of rivalry in college football.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unlvrebels.com/trads/unlv-trads-cannon.html |title=UNLV Official Athletic Site - Traditions |publisher=Unlvrebels.cstv.com |accessdate=2013-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923160200/http://www.unlvrebels.com/trads/unlv-trads-cannon.html |archive-date=2013-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> UNLV trails Nevada in the series 17\u201327 after winning the 2018 game at [[Sam Boyd Stadium]] in [[Whitney, Nevada|Whitney]] by 34 to 29.\n\nUNLV is most known for its men's basketball program.

UNLV was officially founded by the [[Nevada System of Higher Education|Nevada Board of Regents]] as the Southern Division of the University of Nevada on September 10, 1957. The first classes were held on the current campus in the [[Pole building framing|post and beam]] [[Mid Century Modern]] [[Maude Frazier]] Hall designed by the local architectural firm, [[Zick & Sharp]].

During this time, Nevada Southern University also adopted the southern \"Rebel\" athletics moniker and a mascot dressed in a southern Confederate uniform named Beauregard. The popular reasoning behind such a controversial moniker and mascot is that they did it to oppose the northern Union traditions and symbols of their northern rival, the University of Nevada. Soon, protests from NSU/UNLV students forced a slight change to their Confederate mascot, but the \"Rebels\" moniker remains to this day. Since its founding, the university has grown rapidly, expanding both its academic programs and campus facilities.\n\nIn 1969, the board of regents approved the name University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the abbreviation UNLV.<ref name=timeline />\n\nIn 1973, [[Jerry Tarkanian]] was hired as the men's basketball coach by UNLV's second president, Roman Zorn.<ref name=zorn>{{cite news|title=UNLV\u2019s pioneering second president, Zorn, dies at 85 |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2002/aug/20/unlvs-pioneering-second-president-zorn-dies-at-85/|accessdate=19 November 2011|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=20 August 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe Center for Business and Economic Research <!-- (CBER) -->  was established in 1975 for research projects that assist in the development of the Nevada economy and assist state and local agencies and private-sector enterprises in the collection and analysis of economic and market data.\n\nIn 1981, [[Claes Oldenburg]]'s Flashlight sculpture was installed on the plaza between Artemus Ham Hall and Judy Bayley Theatre.<ref>{{cite news|last=Arin|first=Naomi|title=High beam: Using a flashlight to illuminate the public art struggles of \u2018Paintbrushes\u2019|url=http://vegasseven.com/2011/03/17/high-beam/|accessdate=21 November 2011|newspaper=Vegas Seven|date=17 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Lied Institute for Real Estate Studies was established in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBER|url=http://www.unlv.edu/business/cber|website=www.unlv.edu|accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, The School of Dental Medicine opened to train students, and to offer low-cost dental care to residents.

SEB achieved this rating by using recycled glass, steel, concrete, and wood. More than 60% of the leftover construction materials were recycled. The roof of SEB was made to reflect 92% of sunlight. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed into the building, so reduces energy needed to cool the building. Incoming air to SEB is also cooled through evaporation so the need for air conditioning is reduced. High-performance window glazing also allows light to come in while keeping the building insulated. Occupancy sensors allow lights to automatically turn off when a room is not occupied, saving electricity. Low-flow sinks, toilets, and showers, as well as a drip irrigation system for the native desert landscape, reduce water usage by 42%. SEB also uses a reclaimed water system that captures wastewater, providing 750 gallons of water a day that are used to flush toilets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unlv.edu/seb/features |title=Features &#124; Science and Engineering Building &#124; University of Nevada, Las Vegas |publisher=Unlv.edu |accessdate=2013-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026012640/http://www.unlv.edu/seb/features |archive-date=2013-10-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Greenspun College of Urban Affairs building of UNLV received a LEED Gold rating in April 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgbcnv.org/leed-in-nevada |title=USGBC Nevada - LEED in Nevada |publisher=Usgbcnv.org |accessdate=2013-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207161138/http://usgbcnv.org/leed-in-nevada |archivedate=2013-12-07 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, UNLV received the Cashman Good Government Award for the campus' sustainability measures for \"maintaining consistent energy costs despite substantial campus growth,\" saving nearly $11 million from 2001-2009.

The men's basketball team is referred to as the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|Runnin' Rebels]] and the men's baseball team is referred to as the Hustlin' Rebels. The Rebels are a founding member of the [[Mountain West Conference]], in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] Division I. The only exceptions are the UNLV men's soccer team and swim and dive team, which compete in the [[Western Athletic Conference]].\n\nThe school's official colors of scarlet and gray can be traced to 1958, when UNLV adopted as mascot a wolf wearing a Confederate uniform. Scarlet and gray were traditional colors of the Confederacy with its gray uniforms and red-based flag. UNLV's mascot is Hey Reb, the toned-down version of the original mascot named Beauregard, which was a wolf character dressed in [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] hat and uniform. UNLV's Hey Reb mascot made his debut in 1983. He received his first makeover in 1997 and second in 2009. Named one of 12 All-American Mascots, he competed for the title of 2004 Capital One Mascot of the Year and made a strong showing by coming in second in online voting.

Most packages Kali uses are imported from the Debian [[Software repository|repositories]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.kali.org/policy/kali-linux-relationship-with-debian |title=Kali's Relationship With Debian |publisher=Kali Linux |date=2013-03-11 |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe Kali Linux project began quietly in 2012, when Offensive Security decided that they wanted to replace their venerable [[BackTrack]] Linux project, which was manually maintained, with something that could become a genuine [[Debian]] derivative, complete with all of the required infrastructure and improved packaging techniques. The decision was made to build Kali on top of the Debian distribution because it is well known for its quality, stability, and wide selection of available software.\n\nThe first version (1.0) was released one year later, in March 2013, and was based on [[Debian 7 Wheezy|Debian 7 \u201cWheezy\u201d]], Debian\u2019s stable distribution at the time. In that first year of development, they packaged hundreds of pen-testing-related applications and built the infrastructure. Even though the number of applications is significant, the application list has been meticulously curated, dropping applications that no longer worked or that duplicated features already available in better programs.\n\nDuring the two years following version 1.0, Kali released many incremental updates, expanding the range of available applications and improving hardware support, thanks to newer kernel releases. With some investment in continuous integration, they ensured that all important packages were kept in an installable state and that customized live images (a hallmark of the distribution) could always be created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kali.training/topic/a-bit-of-history/ |title=A Bit of History |website=kali.training |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nKali Linux popularity grew when it was featured in multiple episodes of the TV series [[Mr. Robot]].

This mode is very popular for many reasons, partly because many Kali users already have a bootable Kali USB drive or CD, and this option makes it easy to apply Kali to a forensic job. When booted in forensic mode, the system doesn't touch the internal hard drive or swap space and auto mounting is disabled.

Most packages Kali uses are imported from the Debian [[Software repository|repositories]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.kali.org/policy/kali-linux-relationship-with-debian |title=Kali's Relationship With Debian |publisher=Kali Linux |date=2013-03-11 |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe Kali Linux project began quietly in 2012, when Offensive Security decided that they wanted to replace their venerable [[BackTrack]] Linux project, which was manually maintained, with something that could become a genuine [[Debian]] derivative, complete with all of the required infrastructure and improved packaging techniques. The decision was made to build Kali on top of the Debian distribution because it is well known for its quality, stability, and wide selection of available software.\n\nThe first version (1.0) was released one year later, in March 2013, and was based on [[Debian 7 Wheezy|Debian 7 \u201cWheezy\u201d]], Debian\u2019s stable distribution at the time. In that first year of development, they packaged hundreds of pen-testing-related applications and built the infrastructure. Even though the number of applications is significant, the application list has been meticulously curated, dropping applications that no longer worked or that duplicated features already available in better programs.\n\nDuring the two years following version 1.0, Kali released many incremental updates, expanding the range of available applications and improving hardware support, thanks to newer kernel releases. With some investment in continuous integration, they ensured that all important packages were kept in an installable state and that customized live images (a hallmark of the distribution) could always be created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kali.training/topic/a-bit-of-history/ |title=A Bit of History |website=kali.training |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nKali Linux popularity grew when it was featured in multiple episodes of the TV series [[Mr. Robot]].

This mode is very popular for many reasons, partly because many Kali users already have a bootable Kali USB drive or CD, and this option makes it easy to apply Kali to a forensic job. When booted in forensic mode, the system doesn't touch the internal hard drive or swap space and auto mounting is disabled. However, the developers recommend that users test these features extensively before using Kali for real world forensics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.kali.org/general-use/kali-linux-forensics-mode |title=Kali Linux Forensics Mode |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nKali Linux includes security tools, such as:<ref name=\"tools\" />\n{{div col}}\n* [[Aircrack-ng]]\n* [[Armitage (computing)|Armitage]]\n* [[Burp suite]]\n* Cisco Global Exploiter, a hacking tool used to find and exploit vulnerabilities in Cisco Network systems\n* [[Ettercap (software)|Ettercap]]\n* [[Hashcat]]\n* [[John the Ripper]]\n* [[Kismet (software)|Kismet]]\n* [[Maltego]]\n* [[Metasploit]] framework\n* [[Nmap]]\n* [[OWASP ZAP]]\n* [[Social engineering (security)|Social engineering]] tools\n*[[Sqlmap]]\n* [[Wireshark]]\n*[[Hydra (software)|Hydra]]\n* [[Reverse engineering|Reverse engineering]] tools\n* [[Foremost (software)|Foremost]]\n* [[Volatility (memory forensics)|Volatility]] \n{{div col end}}\n\nThese tools can be used for a number of purposes, most of which involve exploiting a victim network or application, performing network discovery, or scanning a target IP address.
