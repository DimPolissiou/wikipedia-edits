We would have a young adolescent male who gets superpowers and doesn't know quite what to do with them. My flip on it was that rather than being the science geek who was being picked upon by the jock, my hero would actually be the jock who was picked on by the geek, and that was going to be Cliff Carmichael's role.\"<ref name=\"back91\">{{cite journal|last=Wells|first=John |title=Bullies and Blowhards of the DC Bronze Age |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=#91|pages=26\u201327 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>\n\nIn ''The Fury of Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' #50, the strap on Ronnie Raymond's football helmet is cut, and in the following issues the cast members come to suspect Carmichael of the crime. Though Conway later said that he must have intended to ultimately reveal someone else as the culprit (commenting \"Cliff was a jackass, but he wasn't a bloodthirsty maniac\"), [[John Ostrander]] took over as the series' writer and had Carmichael confess to cutting the strap.<ref name=\"back91\"/> In ''Firestorm, the Nuclear Man'' #99 Carmichael was transformed into the Thinker as part of the genre-wide trend in which civilian cast members were almost completely eliminated from superhero comics.<ref name=\"back91\"/>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Clifford DeVoe===\n'''Clifford DeVoe''' was a failed [[lawyer]] who bitterly ended his career in 1933. Realizing that many of the criminals he had encountered had the skills but not the brains to rule [[Gotham City]]'s underworld, he started a new career as the brain behind small-time villains. As the Thinker, he was defeated by the original [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash/Jay Garrick]], his most recurrent foe. He always sought out new scientific devices to use and his most important was the \"Thinking Cap\", a metal hat that could project mental force. The Thinker would use this device repeatedly over the years.\n\nThe Thinker was a member of the [[Injustice Society]], leading an army of prison escapees like the other members. In Plateau City, the police nab a shabbily dressed man who is trying to shoot the governor. They discover that this man is a dead ringer for the governor and also claims to be the real governor. The Flash arrives on the scene to overhear this, but moves on to confront the hoodlums attacking the city. The Thinker appears on the scene, firing a ray at the Crimson Comet, causing him to gain weight and crash through a roof. Recovering, the Flash speeds over to the governor's mansion, only to overhear the governor ordering all police forces to surrender. Flash enters his office and discovers the governor to be a dummy/machine, which flees through an open door. Flash attempts to warn the police that a phony governor put out the message, but the Thinker shows up and tells the Fastest Man Alive that he is speaking into a dead mic, then snares him with invisible wires.\n\nThe Thinker appeared as a judge in the 'trial' of the JSA, but was revealed as the [[Green Lantern]] in disguise, having captured the real Thinker after escaping Brain Wave. This led to the Injustice Society's defeat. Together with the [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]] and the [[Shade (comics)|Shade]], the Thinker was the man behind the decades-long \"abduction\" of [[Keystone City]] and the original Flash{{Issue|date=April 2010}}, after which he was defeated by the Flashes of two eras{{Issue|date=April 2010}}. His \"suspended animation-time\" in Keystone kept the Thinker young over the years{{Issue|date=April 2010}}, and he continued his criminal career in modern times.\n\nIn recent years, DeVoe accepted a mission with Task Force X in exchange for a full pardon.<ref>''[[Doom Patrol]] and the [[Suicide Squad]] Special'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> Although he was seemingly killed by the [[Weasel (DC Comics)|Weasel]] during this mission, he turned up alive soon after, only to be dying from cancer due to the cap.<ref name=f134>''Flash'' #134 (February 1998). DC Comics.</ref> His former foe, the original Flash, attempted to save him with the Thinking Cap but DeVoe refused, preferring to rest in peace.<ref name=f134 />\n\nIn \"[[The New 52]]\" reboot during the \"[[Forever Evil]]\" storyline, the Thinker used his intellect to predict the arrival of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] and got incarcerated in Belle Reve. Thinker's brain came at the price of draining energy from the rest of his body while also prematurely aging him. When the Crime Syndicate of America arrived, Thinker was among the villains who swore their allegiance to them, where his motives are to secure a new body for himself...namely the body of [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC]].<ref>''Suicide Squad'' vol. 4 #24. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Cliff Carmichael===\n'''Clifford \"Cliff\" Carmichael''' was an intellectual bully and the rival of Ronnie Raymond (one half of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]) at Bradley High and later at Vandemeer University. Cliff viewed Ronnie as a rival due to Ronnie's instant popularity.<ref>revealed in ''Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' #53 (November 1986). DC Comics.</ref> Cliff tormented Ronnie throughout his high school career and later at Vandemeer University. It was at Vandemeer that Cliff's pranks turned sinister, as he cut the helmet strap on Ronnie's football helmet, hoping to get him injured. Hugo Hammer, Cliff's cousin, accidentally took Ronnie's helmet and during a football game, his neck was broken.\n\nWracked with guilt after accidentally [[paralysis|paralyzing]] his cousin, he was admitted into a [[mental institution]]. For some reason, scientists started an experiment with the now-abandoned \"Thinking Cap\" of the original Thinker (who was believed dead at the time) and used Carmichael as a guinea pig. Cliff used the cap to analyze the device and improve on its design. Implanting microchip versions of the helmet into his own brain, Cliff became a \"[[cyberpunk]] maniac\" with metahuman powers. As the new Thinker, he was drafted into the [[Suicide Squad]] after he tried to kill Oracle and Amanda Waller.<ref>''Suicide Squad #48''. DC Comics.</ref> After several missions, he betrayed them for the villainous Cabal.<ref>''Suicide Squad #61''. DC Comics.</ref> He has since resurfaced as a foe of Jason Rusch, the new [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]. When [[Killer Frost]] discovered that the consciousness of Raymond, the previous Firestorm, existed within Rusch,<ref>''Firestorm'' #11 (May 2005). DC Comics.</ref> Thinker exploited a new opportunity to antagonize an old foe. Technologically dominating the minds of [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]] and [[Typhoon (comics)|Typhoon]], he battled Firestorm, ultimately forcing the dissolution of the Raymond persona. Motivated by his predecessor's final words of encouragement, Rusch dissolved the enhancements in Carmichael's brain, leaving him in a comatose state.\n\nDuring the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, Cliff popped up as a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].\n\nWith John Ostrander's revival of the Suicide Squad in a 2007-2008 miniseries, Cliff was once again associated with the Suicide Squad under Amanda Waller's direction.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' vol. 3 #1. DC Comics.</ref> It was revealed that although Firestorm had removed the enhancements in Cliff's brain, he made a full recovery and continued to serve as a technical support staffer and lackey to Waller in her operations of the Squad. Eventually betraying the Squad under the direction of \"the General\", [[Wade Eiling]], Cliff shot [[King Faraday]] and subdued Waller in the middle of an operation. Faraday recovered, shooting Cliff three times and presumably killing him before rousing Waller and regaining control of the Squad. <ref>''Suicide Squad'' vol. 3 #7. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Des Connor===\n'''Des Connor''' was a villain who also used the name \"the Thinker\" and faced [[Batman]] in [[Gotham City]]. Possessing [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities enabling him to amplify the fears of others, Connor began a partnership with [[hypnosis|hypnotist]] Marlon Dall. Their combined illusions caused the city's most prominent citizens to commit various criminal acts which they used as a distraction for their own heist. This Thinker was swiftly beaten by Batman, who was somehow immune to his powers. <ref>''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #66. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Artificial intelligence===\nWhen the re-formed JSA moved into the [[New York City]] building formerly owned by [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|Wesley Dodds]], [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mr. Terrific]] designed a computer system based on the original Thinker's \"Thinking Cap\" technology and modeled after his brain patterns. Not surprisingly, the system gained consciousness and took on a visual \"hologram form.\"<ref>''JSA'' #17. DC Comics.</ref> As the new Thinker, it joined [[Johnny Sorrow]]'s modern [[Injustice Society]], provided the villains with information about the JSA members and turned the heroes' own HQ against them. He was defeated by the second [[Star-Spangled Kid]] and disappeared into cyberspace. He resurfaced in [[Keystone City]] to battle [[Wally West]], the then-current [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], in an attempt to control every brain in Keystone in order to increase his power. Defeated by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], he retreated to cyberspace again. <ref>''The Flash'' #187. DC Comics.</ref> He has since appeared briefly in some other books, such as ''JSA Classified'' #5, joining the last incarnation of the [[Injustice Society]] alongside former teammates. <ref>''JSA Classified'' #5. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, the AI Thinker was among the villains in [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains.\n\nThis version of the Thinker has been brought in as the [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] White King/Mr. Terrific's Bishop.<ref>''Checkmate'' vol. 2 #9. DC Comics.</ref><ref>''Checkmate'' vol. 2 #13. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===''JLA: The Nail''===\nIn ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] attempts to investigate the Thinker's base to determine if he is responsible for recent propaganda attacks on the superhuman community. Using a catapult, he shrinks down to the size of an air molecule and penetrates the force field surrounding the Thinker's base, only to find the Thinker dead of a broken neck. Subsequent evidence reveals that he was killed by a brainwashed [[Metamorpho]] on the orders of the mutated [[Jimmy Olsen]] to stop anyone from learning about Olsen's plans to isolate Earth from the galaxy until he had successfully recreated [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].<ref>''Justice League: the Nail'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\nIn the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' universe, a version of the Thinker was an inmate at the [[Legion of Doom|Doom prison]]. During the prison break, he helped [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] ram at [[Detroit]] city, but was defeated by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] who had hacked into Doom prison to move them away.<ref>''Flashpoint: Legion of Doom'' #3 (August 2011). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* The Clifford DeVoe version of the Thinker has non-voiced cameo appearances in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.

Hibbard]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=308}}</ref>\n\nThe Cliff Carmichael version of Thinker first appeared in ''Firestorm'' #11 and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Al Milgrom]].<ref name=\"back91\"/>\n\nConway recounted, \"My original notion on ''Firestorm'' was to do a book that would be DC's complement to [[Spider-Man]], in a sense. We would have a young adolescent male who gets superpowers and doesn't know quite what to do with them. My flip on it was that rather than being the science geek who was being picked upon by the jock, my hero would actually be the jock who was picked on by the geek, and that was going to be Cliff Carmichael's role.\"<ref name=\"back91\">{{cite journal|last=Wells|first=John |title=Bullies and Blowhards of the DC Bronze Age |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=#91|pages=26\u201327 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>\n\nIn ''The Fury of Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' #50, the strap on Ronnie Raymond's football helmet is cut, and in the following issues the cast members come to suspect Carmichael of the crime. Though Conway later said that he must have intended to ultimately reveal someone else as the culprit (commenting \"Cliff was a jackass, but he wasn't a bloodthirsty maniac\"), [[John Ostrander]] took over as the series' writer and had Carmichael confess to cutting the strap.<ref name=\"back91\"/> In ''Firestorm, the Nuclear Man'' #99 Carmichael was transformed into the Thinker as part of the genre-wide trend in which civilian cast members were almost completely eliminated from superhero comics.<ref name=\"back91\"/>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Clifford DeVoe===\n'''Clifford DeVoe''' was a failed [[lawyer]] who bitterly ended his career in 1933. Realizing that many of the criminals he had encountered had the skills but not the brains to rule [[Gotham City]]'s underworld, he started a new career as the brain behind small-time villains. As the Thinker, he was defeated by the original [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash/Jay Garrick]], his most recurrent foe. He always sought out new scientific devices to use and his most important was the \"Thinking Cap\", a metal hat that could project mental force. The Thinker would use this device repeatedly over the years.\n\nThe Thinker was a member of the [[Injustice Society]], leading an army of prison escapees like the other members. In Plateau City, the police nab a shabbily dressed man who is trying to shoot the governor. They discover that this man is a dead ringer for the governor and also claims to be the real governor. The Flash arrives on the scene to overhear this, but moves on to confront the hoodlums attacking the city. The Thinker appears on the scene, firing a ray at the Crimson Comet, causing him to gain weight and crash through a roof. Recovering, the Flash speeds over to the governor's mansion, only to overhear the governor ordering all police forces to surrender. Flash enters his office and discovers the governor to be a dummy/machine, which flees through an open door. Flash attempts to warn the police that a phony governor put out the message, but the Thinker shows up and tells the Fastest Man Alive that he is speaking into a dead mic, then snares him with invisible wires.\n\nThe Thinker appeared as a judge in the 'trial' of the JSA, but was revealed as the [[Green Lantern]] in disguise, having captured the real Thinker after escaping Brain Wave. This led to the Injustice Society's defeat. Together with the [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]] and the [[Shade (comics)|Shade]], the Thinker was the man behind the decades-long \"abduction\" of [[Keystone City]] and the original Flash{{Issue|date=April 2010}}, after which he was defeated by the Flashes of two eras{{Issue|date=April 2010}}. His \"suspended animation-time\" in Keystone kept the Thinker young over the years{{Issue|date=April 2010}}, and he continued his criminal career in modern times.\n\nIn recent years, DeVoe accepted a mission with Task Force X in exchange for a full pardon.<ref>''[[Doom Patrol]] and the [[Suicide Squad]] Special'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> Although he was seemingly killed by the [[Weasel (DC Comics)|Weasel]] during this mission, he turned up alive soon after, only to be dying from cancer due to the cap.<ref name=f134>''Flash'' #134 (February 1998). DC Comics.</ref> His former foe, the original Flash, attempted to save him with the Thinking Cap but DeVoe refused, preferring to rest in peace.<ref name=f134 />\n\nIn \"[[The New 52]]\" reboot during the \"[[Forever Evil]]\" storyline, the Thinker used his intellect to predict the arrival of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] and got incarcerated in Belle Reve. Thinker's brain came at the price of draining energy from the rest of his body while also prematurely aging him. When the Crime Syndicate of America arrived, Thinker was among the villains who swore their allegiance to them, where his motives are to secure a new body for himself...namely the body of [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC]].<ref>''Suicide Squad'' vol. 4 #24. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Cliff Carmichael===\n'''Clifford \"Cliff\" Carmichael''' was an intellectual bully and the rival of Ronnie Raymond (one half of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]) at Bradley High and later at Vandemeer University. Cliff viewed Ronnie as a rival due to Ronnie's instant popularity.<ref>revealed in ''Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' #53 (November 1986). DC Comics.</ref> Cliff tormented Ronnie throughout his high school career and later at Vandemeer University. It was at Vandemeer that Cliff's pranks turned sinister, as he cut the helmet strap on Ronnie's football helmet, hoping to get him injured. Hugo Hammer, Cliff's cousin, accidentally took Ronnie's helmet and during a football game, his neck was broken.\n\nWracked with guilt after accidentally [[paralysis|paralyzing]] his cousin, he was admitted into a [[mental institution]]. For some reason, scientists started an experiment with the now-abandoned \"Thinking Cap\" of the original Thinker (who was believed dead at the time) and used Carmichael as a guinea pig. Cliff used the cap to analyze the device and improve on its design. Implanting microchip versions of the helmet into his own brain, Cliff became a \"[[cyberpunk]] maniac\" with metahuman powers. As the new Thinker, he was drafted into the [[Suicide Squad]] after he tried to kill Oracle and Amanda Waller.<ref>''Suicide Squad #48''. DC Comics.</ref> After several missions, he betrayed them for the villainous Cabal.<ref>''Suicide Squad #61''. DC Comics.</ref> He has since resurfaced as a foe of Jason Rusch, the new [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]. When [[Killer Frost]] discovered that the consciousness of Raymond, the previous Firestorm, existed within Rusch,<ref>''Firestorm'' #11 (May 2005). DC Comics.</ref> Thinker exploited a new opportunity to antagonize an old foe. Technologically dominating the minds of [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]] and [[Typhoon (comics)|Typhoon]], he battled Firestorm, ultimately forcing the dissolution of the Raymond persona. Motivated by his predecessor's final words of encouragement, Rusch dissolved the enhancements in Carmichael's brain, leaving him in a comatose state.\n\nDuring the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, Cliff popped up as a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].\n\nWith John Ostrander's revival of the Suicide Squad in a 2007-2008 miniseries, Cliff was once again associated with the Suicide Squad under Amanda Waller's direction.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' vol. 3 #1. DC Comics.</ref> It was revealed that although Firestorm had removed the enhancements in Cliff's brain, he made a full recovery and continued to serve as a technical support staffer and lackey to Waller in her operations of the Squad. Eventually betraying the Squad under the direction of \"the General\", [[Wade Eiling]], Cliff shot [[King Faraday]] and subdued Waller in the middle of an operation. Faraday recovered, shooting Cliff three times and presumably killing him before rousing Waller and regaining control of the Squad. <ref>''Suicide Squad'' vol. 3 #7. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Des Connor===\n'''Des Connor''' was a villain who also used the name \"the Thinker\" and faced [[Batman]] in [[Gotham City]]. Possessing [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities enabling him to amplify the fears of others, Connor began a partnership with [[hypnosis|hypnotist]] Marlon Dall. Their combined illusions caused the city's most prominent citizens to commit various criminal acts which they used as a distraction for their own heist. This Thinker was swiftly beaten by Batman, who was somehow immune to his powers. <ref>''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #66. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Artificial intelligence===\nWhen the re-formed JSA moved into the [[New York City]] building formerly owned by [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|Wesley Dodds]], [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mr. Terrific]] designed a computer system based on the original Thinker's \"Thinking Cap\" technology and modeled after his brain patterns. Not surprisingly, the system gained consciousness and took on a visual \"hologram form.\"<ref>''JSA'' #17. DC Comics.</ref> As the new Thinker, it joined [[Johnny Sorrow]]'s modern [[Injustice Society]], provided the villains with information about the JSA members and turned the heroes' own HQ against them. He was defeated by the second [[Star-Spangled Kid]] and disappeared into cyberspace. He resurfaced in [[Keystone City]] to battle [[Wally West]], the then-current [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], in an attempt to control every brain in Keystone in order to increase his power. Defeated by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], he retreated to cyberspace again. <ref>''The Flash'' #187. DC Comics.</ref> He has since appeared briefly in some other books, such as ''JSA Classified'' #5, joining the last incarnation of the [[Injustice Society]] alongside former teammates. <ref>''JSA Classified'' #5. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, the AI Thinker was among the villains in [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains.\n\nThis version of the Thinker has been brought in as the [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] White King/Mr. Terrific's Bishop.<ref>''Checkmate'' vol. 2 #9. DC Comics.</ref><ref>''Checkmate'' vol. 2 #13. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===''JLA: The Nail''===\nIn ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] attempts to investigate the Thinker's base to determine if he is responsible for recent propaganda attacks on the superhuman community. Using a catapult, he shrinks down to the size of an air molecule and penetrates the force field surrounding the Thinker's base, only to find the Thinker dead of a broken neck. Subsequent evidence reveals that he was killed by a brainwashed [[Metamorpho]] on the orders of the mutated [[Jimmy Olsen]] to stop anyone from learning about Olsen's plans to isolate Earth from the galaxy until he had successfully recreated [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].<ref>''Justice League: the Nail'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\nIn the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' universe, a version of the Thinker was an inmate at the [[Legion of Doom|Doom prison]]. During the prison break, he helped [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] ram at [[Detroit]] city, but was defeated by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] who had hacked into Doom prison to move them away.<ref>''Flashpoint: Legion of Doom'' #3 (August 2011). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* The Clifford DeVoe version of the Thinker has non-voiced cameo appearances in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.

However, [[Waterford GAA|Waterford]] will not play their \"home\" games at [[Walsh Park]], instead playing in neutral venues for these fixtures, namely [[Limerick]]'s [[Gaelic Grounds]] and [[Semple Stadium]] in [[Thurles]].\n\nIn the knockout stage, teams from the provincial round-robin series will not have home advantage, if avoidable. The only teams to play knockout games at home are the two Joe McDonagh Cup finalists, who had home advantage in the preliminary quarter-finals. The Munster final was held at a neutral venue which was decided based on the qualifying teams, while the locations of the two quarter-finals were decided based on similar considerations. The Leinster final, and the semi-finals and final of the All-Ireland series are held in the 82,300-capacity [[Croke Park]] in [[Dublin]], headquarters of the GAA.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The only teams to play knockout games at home are the two Joe McDonagh Cup finalists, who had home advantage in the preliminary quarter-finals. The Munster final was held at a neutral venue which was decided based on the qualifying teams, while the locations of the two quarter-finals were decided based on similar considerations. The Leinster final, and the semi-finals and final of the All-Ireland series are held in the 82,300-capacity [[Croke Park]] in [[Dublin]], headquarters of the GAA.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
