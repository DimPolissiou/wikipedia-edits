The stories partly focus on his pride in his ship, \"the smertest boat in the tred\" which he considers to be of a class with the [[Clyde steamer]]s<!--diesels came rather later than the stories, surely? and his outrage at the suggestion [[diesel]]-engined vessels are in any way superior-->, but mainly tell of the \u201chigh jinks\u201d the crew get up to on their travels. He had at least one [[fictional crossovers|crossover]] with Munro's other popular character, Erchie MacPherson of ''Erchie, My Droll Friend''. The name is an anglicisation of \"Para Shandaidh\", which means \"Peter (Paraig) son of Sandy\", and he is content to describe himself as \"Chust wan of Brutain's hardy sons\".\n\nThe other principal characters who form the crew of the ''Vital Spark'' are:\n* the subtly effete engineer Dan Macphail,  \n* the superstitious ship\u2019s mate Dougie (one inconsistency in the stories is that Dougie the mate has the choice of two surnames, Cameron or Campbell), \n* the lazy deckhand known as The Tar (real name Colin Turner) and \n* the young squeezebox-playing deck hand Sunny Jim (real name Davie Green), who is cousin to The Tar and replaces him. \n\nAlso featured is Hurricane Jack (real name John Maclachlan), Para Handy\u2019s rather more outrageous adventurer friend. \n\nKey points of friction among the crew are transporting ministers of the church (bad luck), transporting gravestones (bad luck), the small boats carrying passengers across the Clyde in Glasgow called the [[Clutha ferry|Cluthas]] (in Para Handy\u2019s view, the lowest of the low in Clyde shipping), and Macphail\u2019s taste for bodice-ripping women\u2019s fiction.\n\n==Stories==\n\nThe stories are set in the Firth of Clyde, Loch Fyne and occasionally the Western Isles of Scotland.  The stories are known for their humour and also for their evocation of a lost era in the life of these coastal communities when they depended completely on the water and not, as now, on road transport and the ferry service. This was a time when [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] was still spoken by some as their native language and everyone in the community was known to all, for good or ill. The church (the [[kirk]]) was much more significant in community life and a lot of humour in the stories is derived from scriptural misquotations, which contemporary readers, with their thorough knowledge of the Bible, would have understood. Reference is also made to schisms in the kirk, with the same humour, which could sting those who were over-serious in defence of their splinter denomination.\n\nThe stories give an insight into the life and attitudes of the Firth of Clyde, its sea lochs and the city of Glasgow. They were written as occasional pieces in the \"Looker On\" column in the \"Glasgow Evening News\" and were designed to be recognisable to Glaswegians with Highland backgrounds and also those who were city-bred but regularly escaped the smoke to go \"doon the watter\" to the Clyde resorts of Rothesay, Millport, Dunoon and Tighnabruaich. The ''Vital Spark'' also makes it to [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] and [[Loch Fyne]], which were more adventurous destinations but also accessible to city dwellers by the railway steamers that Para Handy often envies. Some of the stories were written during the [[First World War]] and give insight into the home front of the time, casting it always in a humorous light. \n\n==Published collections==\nThe stories remain perennially popular and have been regularly reprinted since their first appearance. There are various miscellaneous collections, but the main ones are the three overseen by Munro himself and several more latterday ones.\n* ''The Collected Stories from The Vital Spark'' (1906)\n* ''In Highland Harbours with Para Handy'' (1911)\n* ''Hurricane Jack of The Vital Spark'' (1923)\n\nAll three of these collections have been gathered together and reissued in single volumes:\n* ''Neil Munro's Para Handy'' (Seanachaidh, 1986)\n* ''The World of Para Handy'' (Seanachaidh, 1990)\n\nThe ''Para Handy Complete Edition'' ([[Birlinn (publisher)|Berlinn]], 1992), introduced and annotated by Brian D.

The syconium of ''Ficus'' species supply shelter and food for [[fig wasp]]s and the trees depend on the fig wasps for pollination.\n\n[[Frugivore]] birds disperse the seeds of banyans. The seeds are small, and because most banyans grow in [[woodland]]s, a seedling that germinates on the ground is unlikely to survive. However, many seeds fall on the branches and stems of other trees or on human edifices, and when they germinate they grow roots down toward the ground and consequently may envelop part of the host tree or edifice. For this reason banyans bear the colloquial name \"[[strangler fig]]\". A number of tropical banyan species that compete for sunlight, especially of the genus ''Ficus'', exhibit this strangling habit.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Zhou Zhekun |last2=Gilbert |first2=Michael G. |date=2003 |chapter=Moraceae |editor1=Zhengyi Wu |editor-last2=Raven |editor-first2=Peter H. |editor3=Deyuan Hong |title=Flora of China |chapter-url=http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/china/mss/volume05/Moraceae.pdf |volume=Volume 5 |pages=21\u201373 |isbn=978-1-930723-27-6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901100148/http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/china/mss/volume05/Moraceae.pdf |archive-date=1 September 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Serventy |first=Vincent |date=1984 |title=Australian Native Plants |location=Frenchs Forest, NSW |publisher=Reed |page= |isbn=978-0-7301-0020-1}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2017}}<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=1992 |title=Light in the Rainforest |url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p00820ar.pdf |magazine=Tropical Topics |volume=1 |issue=5 |publisher=Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage |page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529233702/http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p00820ar.pdf |archive-date=29 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe leaves of the banyan tree are large, leathery, glossy, green, and elliptical. Like most figs, the leaf bud is covered by two large scales. As the leaf develops the scales abscise. Young leaves have an attractive reddish tinge.<ref name=\"The Lovely Plants\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thelovelyplants.com/the-banyan-tree/|title=The Banyan Tree|date=14 September 2010|website=The Lovely Plants}}</ref>\n\nOlder banyan trees are characterized by [[Aerial root|aerial prop roots]] that mature into thick, woody trunks, which can become indistinguishable from the primary trunk with age. Old trees can spread laterally by using these prop roots to grow over a wide area. In some species, the prop roots develop over a considerable area that resembles a grove of trees, with every trunk connected directly or indirectly to the primary trunk. The topology of this massive root system inspired the name of the [[Hierarchical#Degree of branching|hierarchical]] computer network operating system \"[[Banyan VINES]]\".\n\n[[File:Strangler fig inside.jpg|thumb|left|Looking upward inside a strangler fig where the host tree has rotted away, leaving a hollow, columnar fig tree]]\nIn a banyan that envelops its host tree, the mesh of roots growing around the latter eventually applies considerable pressure to and commonly kills it. Such an enveloped, dead tree eventually decomposes, so that the banyan becomes a \"columnar tree\" with a hollow, central core. In jungles, such hollows are very desirable shelters to many animals.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name was originally given to ''F. benghalensis'' and comes from India, where early travellers observed that the shade of the tree was frequented by ''Banyans'' (a corruption of Baniyas, a community of Indian traders).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yule |first1=Henry |last2=Burnell |first2=Arthur Coke |date=1903 |editor-last=Crooke |editor-first=William |title=Hobson-Jobson: A glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological, historical, geographical and discursive |url=https://archive.org/stream/hobsonjobsonagl02croogoog#page/n116/mode/1up |edition=New |location=London |publisher=J. Murray |page=65}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Gujarati language]], ''banya'' means \"grocer or merchant\", not \"tree\". The Portuguese picked up the word to refer specifically to Hindu merchants, and passed it along to the English as early as 1599 with the same meaning. By 1634, English writers began to tell of the banyan tree, a tree under which Hindu merchants conducted their business. The tree provided a shaded place for a village meeting or for merchants to sell their goods. Eventually, \"banyan\" became the name of the tree itself.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Classification==\nThe original banyan, ''F. benghalensis'', can grow into a giant tree covering several hectares. Over time, the name became generalized to all [[strangler fig]]s of the ''Urostigma'' subgenus.

It is also called Indian or Bengal fig. This tree is considered sacred in India and can be seen near a temple or religious center. It is a big tree and gives shade to travelers in very hot summer months. An old custom offers worship to this tree.\n* In [[Hinduism]], the leaf of the banyan tree is said to be the resting place for the god [[Krishna]].\n:In the Bhagavat Gita, Krishna said, \"There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down, and the Vedic hymns are its leaves. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.\" (Bg 15.1) Here the material world is described as a tree whose roots are upwards and branches are below. We have experience of a tree whose roots are upward: if one stands on the bank of a river or any reservoir of water, he can see that the trees reflected in the water are upside down. The branches go downward and the roots upward. Similarly, this material world is a reflection of the spiritual world. The material world is but a shadow of reality. In the shadow there is no reality or substantiality, but from the shadow we can understand that there is substance and reality.  \n:The banyan tree is also considered sacred and is called ''vat vriksha'' ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]] ''{{IAST|va\u1e6da v\u1e5bk\u1e63a}}'', \u0935\u091f \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937) in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] known as: \u0c2e\u0c31\u0c4d\u0c31\u0c3f \u0c1a\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c1f\u0c41; ''marri chettu'', in Kannada language known as: 'Alada mara' and in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] known as: '\u0b86\u0bb2 \u0bae\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd' ; ''ala maram''.

The syconium of ''Ficus'' species supply shelter and food for [[fig wasp]]s and the trees depend on the fig wasps for pollination.\n\n[[Frugivore]] birds disperse the seeds of banyans. The seeds are small, and because most banyans grow in [[woodland]]s, a seedling that germinates on the ground is unlikely to survive. However, many seeds fall on the branches and stems of other trees or on human edifices, and when they germinate they grow roots down toward the ground and consequently may envelop part of the host tree or edifice. For this reason banyans bear the colloquial name \"[[strangler fig]]\". A number of tropical banyan species that compete for sunlight, especially of the genus ''Ficus'', exhibit this strangling habit.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Zhou Zhekun |last2=Gilbert |first2=Michael G. |date=2003 |chapter=Moraceae |editor1=Zhengyi Wu |editor-last2=Raven |editor-first2=Peter H. |editor3=Deyuan Hong |title=Flora of China |chapter-url=http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/china/mss/volume05/Moraceae.pdf |volume=Volume 5 |pages=21\u201373 |isbn=978-1-930723-27-6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901100148/http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/china/mss/volume05/Moraceae.pdf |archive-date=1 September 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Serventy |first=Vincent |date=1984 |title=Australian Native Plants |location=Frenchs Forest, NSW |publisher=Reed |page= |isbn=978-0-7301-0020-1}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2017}}<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=1992 |title=Light in the Rainforest |url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p00820ar.pdf |magazine=Tropical Topics |volume=1 |issue=5 |publisher=Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage |page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529233702/http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p00820ar.pdf |archive-date=29 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe leaves of the banyan tree are large, leathery, glossy, green, and elliptical.

Old trees can spread laterally by using these prop roots to grow over a wide area. In some species, the prop roots develop over a considerable area that resembles a grove of trees, with every trunk connected directly or indirectly to the primary trunk. The topology of this massive root system inspired the name of the [[Hierarchical#Degree of branching|hierarchical]] computer network operating system \"[[Banyan VINES]]\".\n\n[[File:Strangler fig inside.jpg|thumb|left|Looking upward inside a strangler fig where the host tree has rotted away, leaving a hollow, columnar fig tree]]\nIn a banyan that envelops its host tree, the mesh of roots growing around the latter eventually applies considerable pressure to and commonly kills it.

Micropulse systems utilize intermittent bursts of energy. They developed as a result of ever-increasing computer power, combined with advances in laser technology. They use considerably less energy in the laser, typically on the order of one [[Joule#Microjoule|microjoule]], and are often \"eye-safe\", meaning they can be used without safety precautions. High-power systems are common in atmospheric research, where they are widely used for measuring atmospheric parameters: the height, layering and densities of clouds, cloud particle properties ([[refractive index#Dispersion and absorption|extinction coefficient]], backscatter coefficient, [[depolarization]]), temperature, pressure, wind, humidity, and trace gas concentration (ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, etc.).<ref name=\"cracknell\" />\n\n== Components ==\n\nLidar systems consist of several major components.\n\n=== Laser ===\n600\u20131000 [[nanometre|nm]] [[laser]]s are most common for non-scientific applications. The maximum power of the laser is limited, or an automatic shut off system which turns the laser off at specific altitudes is used in order to make it eye safe for the people in the ground.\n\nOne common alternative, 1550&nbsp;nm lasers, are eye-safe at relatively high power levels since this wavelength is not strongly absorbed by the eye, but the detector technology is less advanced and so these wavelengths are generally used at longer ranges with lower accuracies. They are also used for military applications because 1550&nbsp;nm is not visible in [[Night vision device|night vision goggles]], unlike the shorter 1000&nbsp;nm infrared laser.\n\nAirborne topographic mapping lidars generally use 1064&nbsp;nm diode pumped [[YAG]] lasers, while [[bathymetric]] (underwater depth research) systems generally use 532&nbsp;nm frequency doubled diode pumped YAG lasers because 532&nbsp;nm penetrates water with much less [[attenuation]] than does 1064&nbsp;nm. Laser settings include the laser repetition rate (which controls the data collection speed). Pulse length is generally an attribute of the laser cavity length, the number of passes required through the gain material (YAG, [[YLF]], etc.), and [[Q-switch]] (pulsing) speed. Better target resolution is achieved with shorter pulses, provided the lidar receiver detectors and electronics have sufficient bandwidth.<ref name=\"cracknell\" />\n\n==== Flash lidar ====\nThe focal plane of a Flash lidar camera has rows and columns of pixels with ample \"depth\" and \"intensity\" to create 3D landscape models.<ref name=\":12\" /> Each pixel records the time it takes each laser pulse to hit the target and return to the sensor, as well as the depth, location, and reflective intensity of the object being contacted by the laser pulse.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nFlash uses a single light source that illuminates the field of view in a single pulse, like a camera that takes pictures of distance, instead of colors.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/solid-state-lidar-for-self-driving-cars/|title=A self-driving car in every driveway?

The power is limited to levels that do not damage human retinas. Wavelengths must not affect human eyes. However, low-cost silicon imagers do not read light in the eye-safe spectrum. Instead, [[Gallium arsenide|gallium-arsenide]] imagers are required, which can boost costs to $200,000.<ref name=\":11\" /> Gallium-arsenide is the same compound used to produce high-cost, high-efficiency solar panels usually used in space applications.\n\n==== Phased arrays ====\nA phased array can illuminate any direction by using a microscopic array of individual antennas. Controlling the timing (phase) of each antenna steers a cohesive signal in a specific direction.\n\n[[Phased array]]s have been used in [[radar]] since the 1950s. The same technique can be used with light. On the order of a million optical antennas are used to see a radiation pattern of a certain size in a certain direction. The system is controlled by timing the precise flash. A single chip (or a few) replace a $75,000 electromechanical system, drastically reducing costs.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nSeveral companies are working on developing commercial solid-state lidar units, including the company [[Quanergy]] which is designing a 905&nbsp;nm solid state device, although they appear to be having some issues in development.<ref name=\"ars 2019\">{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/the-ars-technica-guide-to-the-lidar-industry/ |title=How 10 leading companies are trying to make powerful, low-cost lidar |website=[[Ars Technica]] |date=1 February 2019 |author=Lee, Timothy B.}}</ref>\n\nThe control system can change the shape of the lens to enable zoom in/zoom out functions.

By contrast, solid-state lidar can run for 100,000 hours.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n==== Microelectromechanical machines ====\nMicroelectromechanical mirrors (MEMS) are not entirely solid-state. However, their tiny form factor provides many of the same cost benefits. A single laser is directed to a single mirror that can be reoriented to view any part of the target field. The mirror spins at a rapid rate. However, MEMS systems generally operate in a single plane (left to right). To add a second dimension generally requires a second mirror that moves up and down. Alternatively, another laser can hit the same mirror from another angle. MEMS systems can be disrupted by shock/vibration and may require repeated calibration. The goal is to create a small microchip to enhance innovation and further technological advances.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Scanner and optics ===\nImage development speed is affected by the speed at which they are scanned. Options to scan the [[azimuth]] and elevation include dual oscillating plane mirrors, a combination with a polygon mirror and a [[Laser scanning|dual axis scanner]]. Optic choices affect the angular resolution and range that can be detected. A hole mirror or a [[beam splitter]] are options to collect a return signal.\n\n=== Photodetector and receiver electronics ===\nTwo main [[photodetector]] technologies are used in lidar: [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid state]] photodetectors, such as silicon avalanche [[photodiode]]s, or [[photomultiplier]]s. The sensitivity of the receiver is another parameter that has to be balanced in a lidar design.\n\n=== Position and navigation systems ===\nLidar sensors mounted on mobile platforms such as airplanes or satellites require instrumentation to determine the absolute position and orientation of the sensor. Such devices generally include a [[Global Positioning System]] receiver and an [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU).\n\n=== Sensor ===\n[[File:LiDAR_Scanner_and_Back_Camera_of_iPad_Pro_2020_-_3.jpg|200px|thumb|The lidar scanner on the fourth-generation [[iPad Pro]]|alt=]]\n\nLidar uses active sensors that supply their own illumination source. The energy source hits objects and the reflected energy is detected and measured by sensors. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between transmitted and backscattered pulses and by using the speed of light to calculate the distance traveled.<ref name=\"NASA\">{{Cite web|url=https://earthdata.nasa.gov/user-resources/remote-sensors#hyperspectral|title=Remote Sensors {{!}} Earthdata|website=earthdata.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-03-18}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Flash LIDAR allows for 3D imaging because of the camera's ability to emit a larger flash and sense the spatial relationships and dimensions of area of interest with the returned energy. This allows for more accurate imaging because the captured frames do not need to be stitched together, and the system is not sensitive to platform motion resulting in less distortion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.advancedscientificconcepts.com/technology/technology.html|title=Advanced Scientific Concepts Inc|website=advancedscientificconcepts.com|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref>\n\n3-D imaging can be achieved using both scanning and non-scanning systems. \"3-D gated viewing laser radar\" is a non-scanning laser ranging system that applies a pulsed laser and a fast gated camera. Research has begun for virtual beam steering using [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP) technology.\n\nImaging lidar can also be performed using arrays of high speed detectors and modulation sensitive detector arrays typically built on single chips using [[complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (CMOS) and hybrid CMOS/[[Charge-coupled device]] (CCD) fabrication techniques. In these devices each pixel performs some local processing such as demodulation or gating at high speed, downconverting the signals to video rate so that the array can be read like a camera. Using this technique many thousands of pixels / channels may be acquired simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Medina, Antonio|title=Three Dimensional Camera and Rangefinder|publisher=United States Patent 5081530|volume=January 1992|page=}}</ref> High resolution 3-D lidar cameras use [[homodyne detection]] with an electronic CCD or CMOS [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]].<ref name=\"Medina A, Gay\u00e1 F, and Pozo F 800\u2013805 http://www.opticsinfobase.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?URI=josaa-23-4-800\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Medina A, Gay\u00e1 F, Pozo F|year=2006|title=Compact laser radar and three-dimensional camera|journal=J.

The chip uses [[indium gallium arsenide]] (InGaAs), which operates in the infrared spectrum at a relatively long wavelength that allows for higher power and longer ranges.

InGaAs uses less hazardous wavelengths than conventional silicon detectors, which operate at visual wavelengths.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Talbot|first=David|date=2014-02-13|title=New Optical Chip Will Sharpen Military and Archeological Aerial Imaging|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/524166/the-worlds-most-powerful-3-d-laser-imager|accessdate=2014-02-17|magazine=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n\n===Based on orientation===\nLidar can be oriented to [[nadir]], [[zenith]], or laterally.\nFor example, lidar altimeters look down, an atmospheric lidar looks up, and lidar-based [[collision avoidance system]]s are side-looking.\n\n===Based on platform===\nLidar applications can be divided into airborne and terrestrial types.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Airborne and terrestrial laser scanning|last = Vosselman|first = George|publisher = Whittles Publishing|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-904445-87-6|location = |pages = |last2 = Maas|first2 = Hans-Gerd}}</ref> The two types require scanners with varying specifications based on the data's purpose, the size of the area to be captured, the range of measurement desired, the cost of equipment, and more.\nSpaceborne platforms are also possible, see [[satellite laser altimetry]].\n\n==== Airborne  ====\nAirborne lidar (also ''airborne laser scanning'') is when a laser scanner, while attached to an aircraft during flight, creates a [[Point cloud|3-D point cloud]] model of the landscape. This is currently the most detailed and accurate method of creating [[digital elevation model]]s, replacing [[photogrammetry]]. One major advantage in comparison with photogrammetry is the ability to filter out reflections from vegetation from the point cloud model to create a [[Digital Terrain Model|digital terrain model]] which represents ground surfaces such as rivers, paths, cultural heritage sites, etc., which are concealed by trees. Within the category of airborne lidar, there is sometimes a distinction made between high-altitude and low-altitude applications, but the main difference is a reduction in both accuracy and point density of data acquired at higher altitudes. Airborne lidar can also be used to create bathymetric models in shallow water.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Airborne laser bathymetry for documentation of submerged archaeological sites in shallow water|journal = ISPRS \u2013 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences|pages = 99\u2013107|volume = XL-5/W5|doi = 10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-5-w5-99-2015|first = M.|last = Doneus|first2 = I.|last2 = Miholjek|first3 = G.|last3 = Mandlburger|first4 = N.|last4 = Doneus|first5 = G.|last5 = Verhoeven|first6 = Ch.|last6 = Briese|first7 = M.|last7 = Pregesbauer|bibcode = 2015ISPArXL55...99D |year = 2015|doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\nThe main constituents of airborne lidar include [[digital elevation model]]s (DEM) and digital surface models (DSM). The points and ground points are the vectors of discrete points while DEM and DSM are interpolated raster grids of discrete points. The process also involves capturing of digital aerial photographs. In order to interpret deep-seated landslides for example, under the cover of vegetation, scarps, tension cracks or tipped trees airborne lidar is used. Airborne lidar digital elevation models can see through the canopy of forest cover, perform detailed measurements of scarps, erosion and tilting of electric poles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiu|first=Cheng-Lung|last2=Fei|first2=Li-Yuan|last3=Liu|first3=Jin-King|last4=Wu|first4=Ming-Chee|title=National Airborne Lidar Mapping and Examples for applications in deep-seated landslides in Taiwan|journal=Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2015 IEEE International|issn= 2153-7003|volume=}}</ref>\n\nAirborne lidar data is processed using a toolbox called Toolbox for Lidar Data Filtering and Forest Studies (TIFFS)<ref name=\":10\" /> for lidar data filtering and terrain study software. The data is interpolated to digital terrain models using the software. The laser is directed at the region to be mapped and each point's height above the ground is calculated by subtracting the original z-coordinate from the corresponding digital terrain model elevation. Based on this height above the ground the non-vegetation data is obtained which may include objects such as buildings, electric power lines, flying birds, insects, etc. The rest of the points are treated as vegetation and used for modeling and mapping. Within each of these plots, lidar metrics are calculated by calculating statistics such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, percentiles, quadratic mean, etc.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Yuan|first=Zeng|last2=Yujin|first2=Zhao|last3=Dan|first3=Zhao|last4=Bingfang|first4=Wu|title=Forest Biodiversity mapping using airborne and hyper-spectral data|journal=Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2016 IEEE International |issn=2153-7003|volume=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Airborne Lidar Bathymetric Technology.jpg|thumb|Airborne Lidar Bathymetric Technology-High-resolution multibeam lidar map showing spectacularly faulted and deformed seafloor geology, in shaded relief and coloured by depth.]]\n\n===== Airborne lidar bathymetry =====\nThe airborne lidar [[bathymetric]] technological system involves the measurement of time of flight of a signal from a source to its return to the sensor. The data acquisition technique involves a sea floor mapping component and a ground truth component that includes video transects and sampling. It works using a green spectrum (532&nbsp;nm) laser beam.<ref>[https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/corbin/class_description/Nayegandhi_green_lidar.pdf Nayegandhi Green Lidar]</ref> Two beams are projected onto a fast rotating mirror, which creates an array of points. One of the beams penetrates the water and also detects the bottom surface of the water under favorable conditions.\n\nThe data obtained shows the full extent of the land surface exposed above the sea floor. This technique is extremely useful as it will play an important role in the major sea floor mapping program. The mapping yields onshore topography as well as underwater elevations. Sea floor reflectance imaging is another solution product from this system which can benefit mapping of underwater habitats. This technique has been used for three-dimensional image mapping of California's waters using a hydrographic lidar.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book |isbn=978-1-4244-2126-8 |doi=10.1109/OCEANSKOBE.2008.4530980|chapter=Using Airborne Hydrographic LiDAR to Support Mapping of California's Waters|title=OCEANS 2008 - MTS/IEEE Kobe Techno-Ocean|pages=1\u20138|year=2008|last1=Wilson|first1=Jerry C.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Yellowscan LIDAR on OnyxStar FOX-C8 HD.jpg|thumb|Lidar scanning performed with a multicopter [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]].]]\n[[Drone aircraft|Drones]] are now being used with laser scanners, as well as other remote sensors, as a more economical method to scan smaller areas.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Drone remote sensing for forestry research and practices|journal = Journal of Forestry Research|date = 2015-06-21|issn = 1007-662X|pages = 791\u2013797|volume = 26|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s11676-015-0088-y |first = Lina|last = Tang|first2 = Guofan|last2 = Shao}}</ref> The possibility of drone remote sensing also eliminates any danger that crews of a manned aircraft may be subjected to in difficult terrain or remote areas.\n\n==== Terrestrial  ====\nTerrestrial applications of lidar (also ''terrestrial laser scanning'') happen on the Earth's surface and can be either stationary or mobile. Stationary terrestrial scanning is most common as a survey method, for example in conventional topography, monitoring, cultural heritage documentation and forensics.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[Point cloud|3-D point clouds]] acquired from these types of scanners can be matched with digital images taken of the scanned area from the scanner's location to create realistic looking 3-D models in a relatively short time when compared to other technologies. Each point in the point cloud is given the colour of the pixel from the image taken located at the same angle as the laser beam that created the point.\n\nMobile lidar (also ''mobile laser scanning'') is when two or more scanners are attached to a moving vehicle to collect data along a path. These scanners are almost always paired with other kinds of equipment, including [[Satellite navigation|GNSS]] receivers and [[Inertial measurement unit|IMUs]]. One example application is surveying streets, where power lines, exact bridge heights, bordering trees, etc. all need to be taken into account. Instead of collecting each of these measurements individually in the field with a [[Tachymeter (survey)|tachymeter]], a 3-D model from a point cloud can be created where all of the measurements needed can be made, depending on the quality of the data collected. This eliminates the problem of forgetting to take a measurement, so long as the model is available, reliable and has an appropriate level of accuracy.\n\nTerrestrial lidar mapping involves a process of occupancy grid map generation. The process involves an array of cells divided into grids which employ a process to store the height values when lidar data falls into the respective grid cell. A binary map is then created by applying a particular threshold to the cell values for further processing. The next step is to process the radial distance and z-coordinates from each scan to identify which 3-D points correspond to each of the specified grid cell leading to the process of data formation.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sang-Mook|last2=Joon Im|first2=Jeong|last3=Lee|first3=Bo-Hee|last4=Leonessa|first4=Alexander|last5=Kurdila|first5=Andrew|title=A real time grid-map generation and object classification for ground based 3D lidar data using image analysis techniques|journal=Image Processing (ICIP), 2010 17th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing |issn= 1522-4880|volume=}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:LIDAR equipped mobile robot.jpg|thumb|This [[mobile robot]] uses its lidar to construct a map and avoid obstacles.]]\n\nThere are a wide variety of applications for lidar, in addition to the applications listed below, as it is often mentioned in [[National lidar dataset]] programs.\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:LIDAR field yield.jpg|thumb|alt=Graphic of a lidar return, featuring different crop yield rates.|Lidar is used to analyze yield rates on agricultural fields.]]\n\n[[Agricultural robot]]s have been used for a variety of purposes ranging from seed and fertilizer dispersions, sensing techniques as well as crop scouting for the task of weed control.\n\nLidar can help determine where to apply costly fertilizer.

Lidar-derived products can be easily integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) for analysis and interpretation.\n\nLidar can also help to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) of archaeological sites that can reveal micro-topography that is otherwise hidden by vegetation. The intensity of the returned lidar signal can be used to detect features buried under flat vegetated surfaces such as fields, especially when mapping using the infrared spectrum.

Lidar systems play an important role in the safety of transportation systems. Lots of electronic systems which add to the driver assistance and vehicle safety such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Emergency Brake Assist, and [[Anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (ABS) depend on the detection of a vehicle's environment to act autonomously or semi-autonomously. Lidar mapping and estimation achieve this.\n\nBasics overview: Current lidar systems use rotating hexagonal mirrors which split the laser beam. The upper three beams are used for vehicle and obstacles ahead and the lower beams are used to detect lane markings and road features.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Takagi|first=Kiyokazu|last2=Morikawa|first2=Katsuhiro|last3=Ogawa|first3=Takashi|last4=Saburi|first4=Makoto|title=Road Environment Recognition Using On-vehicle LIDAR|journal=IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium |year=2006 |isbn= 978-4-901122-86-3|volume=|doi=10.1109/IVS.2006.1689615}}</ref> The major advantage of using lidar is that the spatial structure is obtained and this data can be fused with other sensors such as [[radar]], etc. to get a better picture of the vehicle environment in terms of static and dynamic properties of the objects present in the environment. Conversely, a significant issue with lidar is the difficulty in reconstructing point cloud data in poor weather conditions. In heavy rain, for example, the light pulses emitted from the lidar system are partially reflected off of rain droplets which adds noise to the data, called 'echoes'.<ref>{{Cite book|title= 2016 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)|pages=2242\u20132247|language=en-US|doi=10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795918|chapter= Test methodology for rain influence on automotive surround sensors|year=2016|last1=Hasirlioglu|first1=Sinan|last2=Kamann|first2=Alexander|last3=Doric|first3=Igor|last4=Brandmeier|first4=Thomas|isbn=978-1-5090-1889-5}}</ref>\n\nBelow mentioned are various approaches of processing lidar data and using it along with data from other sensors through sensor fusion to detect the vehicle environment conditions.\n\n===== GRID based processing using 3-D lidar and fusion with radar measurement =====\nIn this method, proposed by Philipp Lindner and Gerd Wanielik, laser data is processed using a multidimensional occupancy grid.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Lindner|first=Philipp|last2=Wanielik|first2=Gerd|title=3D LIDAR Processing for Vehicle Safety and Environment Recognition|journal=IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Vehicles and Vehicular Systems |year=2009 |isbn= 978-1-4244-2770-3|volume=|doi=10.1109/CIVVS.2009.4938725}}</ref> Data from a four-layer laser is pre-processed at the signal level and then processed at a higher level to extract the features of the obstacles. A combination two- and three-dimensional grid structure is used and the space in these structures is [[Tessellation|tessellated]] into several discrete cells. This method allows a huge amount of raw measurement data to be effectively handled by collecting it in spatial containers, the cells of the evidence grid. Each cell is associated with a probability measure that identifies the cell occupation. This probability is calculated by using the range measurement of the lidar sensor obtained over time and a new range measurement, which are related using [[Bayes' theorem]]. A two-dimensional grid can observe an obstacle in front of it, but cannot observe the space behind the obstacle. To address this, the unknown state behind the obstacle is assigned a probability of 0.5. By introducing the third dimension or in other terms using a multi-layer laser, the spatial configuration of an object could be mapped into the grid structure to a degree of complexity. This is achieved by transferring the measurement points into a three-dimensional grid. The grid cells which are occupied will possess a probability greater than 0.5 and the mapping would be color-coded based on the probability. The cells that are not occupied will possess a probability less than 0.5 and this area will usually be white space. This measurement is then transformed to a grid coordinate system by using the sensor position on the vehicle and the vehicle position in the world coordinate system. The coordinates of the sensor depend upon its location on the vehicle and the coordinates of the vehicle are computed using [[Visual odometry#Egomotion|egomotion]] estimation, which is estimating the vehicle motion relative to a rigid scene. For this method, the grid profile must be defined. The grid cells touched by the transmitted laser beam are calculated by applying [[Bresenham's line algorithm]]. To obtain the spatially extended structure, a connected component analysis of these cells is performed. This information is then passed on to a [[Rotating calipers|rotating caliper]] algorithm to obtain the spatial characteristics of the object. In addition to the lidar detection, RADAR data obtained by using two short-range radars is integrated to get additional dynamic properties of the object, such as its velocity. The measurements are assigned to the object using a potential distance function.\n\n; Advantages and disadvantages \nThe geometric features of the objects are extracted efficiently, from the measurements obtained by the 3-D occupancy grid, using rotating caliper algorithm. Fusing the radar data to the lidar measurements give information about the dynamic properties of the obstacle such as velocity and location of the obstacle with respect to the sensor location which helps the vehicle or the driver decide the action to be performed in order to ensure safety. The only concern is the computational requirement to implement this data processing technique. It can be implemented in real time and has been proven efficient if the 3-D occupancy grid size is considerably restricted. But this can be improved to an even wider range by using dedicated spatial data structures that manipulate the spatial data more effectively, for the 3-D grid representation.\n\n===== Fusion of 3-D lidar and color camera for multiple object detection and tracking =====\nThe framework proposed in this method by Soonmin Hwang et al.,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hwang|first=Soonmin|last2=Kim|first2=Namil|last3=Choi|first3=Yukyung|last4=Lee|first4=Seokju|last5=So Kweon|first5=In|title=Fast Multiple Objects Detection and Tracking Fusing Color Camera and 3D LIDAR for Intelligent Vehicles|journal=13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI) |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-5090-0821-6|volume=}}</ref> is split into four steps. First, the data from the camera and 3-D lidar is input into the system. Both inputs from lidar and camera are parallelly obtained and the color image from the camera is calibrated with the lidar. To improve the efficiency, horizontal 3-D point sampling is applied as pre-processing. Second, the segmentation stage is where the entire 3-D points are divided into several groups per the distance from the sensor and local planes from close plane to far plane are sequentially estimated. The local planes are estimated using statistical analysis. The group of points closer to the sensor are used to compute the initial plane. By using the current local plane, the next local plane is estimated by an iterative update. The object proposals in the 2-D image are used to separate foreground objects from background. For faster and accurate detection and tracking Binarized Normed Gradients for Objectness Estimation at 300fps is used.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cheng|first=Ming-Ming|last2=Zhang|first2=Ziming|last3=Lin|first3=Wen-Yan|last4=Torr|first4=Philip|title=BING: Binarized normed gradients for objectness estimation at 300fps|journal=IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition |year=2014 |isbn= 978-1-4799-5118-5|volume=}}</ref> BING is a combination of normed gradient and its binarized version which speeds up the feature extraction and testing process, to estimate the objectness of an image window. This way the foreground and background objects are separated. To form objects after estimating the objectness of an image using BING, the 3-D points are grouped or clustered. Clustering is done using [[DBSCAN]] (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm which could be robust due to its less-parametric characteristic. Using the clustered 3-D points, i.e. 3-D segment, more accurate region-of-interests (RoIs) are generated by projecting 3-D points on the 2-D image. The third step is detection, which is broadly divided into two parts. First is object detection in 2-D image which is achieved using Fast R-CNN<ref>{{Cite book|last=Girshick|first=Ross |year= 2015 |isbn= 978-1-4673-8391-2|volume=|pages=1440\u20131448|doi=10.1109/ICCV.2015.169|chapter=Fast R-CNN |title=2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) }}</ref> as this method doesn't need training and it also considers an image and several regions of interest. Second is object detection in 3-D space that is done by using the spin image method.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=E. Johnson|first=Andrew|last2=Hebert|first2=Martial|title=Using spin images for efficient object recognition in cluttered 3D scenes|journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |year=1999 |issn=0162-8828|volume=21|issue=5|pages=433\u2013449|doi=10.1109/34.765655|url=http://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/publications/Andrew_Johnson/aejPAMI1999.pdf}}</ref> This method extracts local and global histograms to represent a certain object. To merge the results of 2-D image and 3-D space object detection, same 3-D region is considered and two independent classifiers from 2-D image and 3-D space are applied to the considered region. Scores calibration<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Philippe|last2=Davoine|first2=Franck|last3=Denoeux|first3=Thierry|title=Evidential combination of pedestrian detectors|journal=Proceedings British Machine Vision Conference, BMVA Press |date= September 2014|volume=}}</ref> is done to get a single confidence score from both detectors. This single score is obtained in the form of probability. The final step is tracking. This is done by associating moving objects in present and past frame. For object tracking, segment matching is adopted. Features such as mean, standard deviation, quantized color histograms, volume size and number of 3-D points of a segment are computed. Euclidean distance is used to measure differences between segments. To judge the appearance and disappearance of an object, similar segments (obtained based on the Euclidean distance) from two different frames are taken and the physical distance and dissimilarity scores are calculated. If the scores go beyond a range for every segment in the previous frame, the object being tracked is considered to have disappeared.\n\n; Advantages and disadvantages \nThe advantages of this method are using 2-D image and 3-D data together, F l-score (which gives a measure of test's accuracy), average precision (AP) are higher than that when only 3-D data from lidar is used. These scores are conventional measurements which judge the framework. The drawback of this method is the usage of BING for object proposal estimation as BING predicts a small set of object bounding boxes.\n\n===== Obstacle detection and road environment recognition using lidar =====\nThis method proposed by Kun Zhou et al.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Zhou|first=Kun|last2=Wang|first2=Xiqin|last3=Tomizukat|first3=Masayoshi|last4=Zhang|first4=Wei-Bin|last5=Chant|first5=Ching-Yao|title=A New Manoeuvring Target Tracking Algorithm with Input Estimation|journal=Proceedings of the 2002 American Control Conference |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-7803-7298-6|volume=|doi=10.1109/ACC.2002.1024798|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1263011}}</ref> not only focuses on object detection and tracking but also recognizes lane marking and road features. As mentioned earlier the lidar systems use rotating hexagonal mirrors that split the laser beam into six beams. The upper three layers are used to detect the forward objects such as vehicles and roadside objects. The sensor is made of weather-resistant material. The data detected by lidar are clustered to several segments and tracked by [[Kalman filter]]. Data clustering here is done based on characteristics of each segment based on object model, which distinguish different objects such as vehicles, signboards, etc. These characteristics include the dimensions of the object, etc. The reflectors on the rear edges of vehicles are used to differentiate vehicles from other objects. Object tracking is done using a 2-stage Kalman filter considering the stability of tracking and the accelerated motion of objects<ref name=\":4\" /> Lidar reflective intensity data is also used for curb detection by making use of robust regression to deal with occlusions. The road marking is detected using a modified Otsu method by distinguishing rough and shiny surfaces.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Y. Hata|first=Alberto|last2=F. Wolf|first2=Denis|year=|title=Feature Detection for Vehicle Localization in Urban Environments Using a Multilayer LIDAR|url=|journal=IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System|volume=17|pages=|issn=1558-0016|via=|number=2}}</ref>\n\n; Advantages\nRoadside reflectors that indicate lane border are sometimes hidden due to various reasons. Therefore, other information is needed to recognize the road border. The lidar used in this method can measure the reflectivity from the object. Hence, with this data road border can also be recognized. Also, the usage of sensor with weather-robust head helps detecting the objects even in bad weather conditions. Canopy Height Model before and after flood is a good example. Lidar can detect high detailed canopy height data as well as its road border.\n\nLidar measurements help identify the spatial structure of the obstacle. This helps distinguish objects based on size and estimate the impact of driving over it.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nLidar systems provide better range and a large field of view which helps detecting obstacles on the curves. This is one major advantage over RADAR systems which have a narrower field of view. The fusion of lidar measurement with different sensors makes the system robust and useful in real-time applications, since lidar dependent systems can't estimate the dynamic information about the detected object.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIt has been shown that lidar can be manipulated, such that self-driving cars are tricked into taking evasive action.<ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/07/hackers-trick-self-driving-cars-lidar-sensor|title=Hackers can trick self-driving cars into taking evasive action|journal=The Guardian|first=Samuel|last=Gibbs|date=7 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Biology and conservation===\n[[File:Forest LIDAR.jpg|thumb|Lidar imaging comparing old-growth forest (right) to a new plantation of trees (left)]]\nLidar has also found many applications in [[forestry]]. [[canopy (forest)|Canopy]] heights, [[biomass]] measurements, and leaf area can all be studied using airborne lidar systems. Similarly, lidar is also used by many industries, including Energy and Railroad, and the Department of Transportation as a faster way of surveying. Topographic maps can also be generated readily from lidar, including for recreational use such as in the production of [[orienteering]] maps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lidarbasemaps.org |title=Lidar Links of Use in Mapping |website=Lidarbasemaps.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-22}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the [[Save the Redwoods League]] has undertaken a project to map the tall redwoods on the Northern California coast. Lidar allows research scientists to not only measure the height of previously unmapped trees, but to determine the biodiversity of the redwood forest. [[Stephen Sillett]], who is working with the League on the North Coast lidar project, claims this technology will be useful in directing future efforts to preserve and protect ancient redwood trees.<ref>Councillor Quarterly, Summer 2007 Volume 6 Issue 3</ref>{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Geology and soil science===\nHigh-resolution [[digital elevation map]]s generated by airborne and stationary lidar have led to significant advances in [[geomorphology]] (the branch of geoscience concerned with the origin and evolution of the Earth surface topography). The lidar abilities to detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks, to measure the land-surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy, to better resolve spatial derivatives of elevation, and to detect elevation changes between repeat surveys have enabled many novel studies of the physical and chemical processes that shape landscapes.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Hughes, M.

Lidar technology has since expanded vastly in capability and lidar systems are used to perform a range of measurements that include profiling clouds, measuring winds, studying aerosols, and quantifying various atmospheric components. Atmospheric components can in turn provide useful information including surface pressure (by measuring the absorption of oxygen or nitrogen), greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide and methane), photosynthesis (carbon dioxide), fires (carbon monoxide), and humidity (water vapor). [[Atmospheric lidar]]s can be either ground-based, airborne or satellite depending on the type of measurement.\n\nAtmospheric lidar remote sensing works in two ways \u2013 \n# by measuring backscatter from the atmosphere, and \n# by measuring the scattered reflection off the ground (when the lidar is airborne) or other hard surface.\n\nBackscatter from the atmosphere directly gives a measure of clouds and aerosols. Other derived measurements from backscatter such as winds or cirrus ice crystals require careful selecting of the wavelength and/or polarization detected. ''Doppler lidar'' and ''Rayleigh Doppler lidar'' are used to measure temperature and/or wind speed along the beam by measuring the frequency of the backscattered light. The [[Doppler broadening]] of gases in motion allows the determination of properties via the resulting frequency shift.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Li | year = 2011 | first1 = T. |title = Middle atmosphere temperature trend and solar cycle revealed by long-term Rayleigh lidar observations |journal = J.

Both pulsed and continuous wave systems are being used.

When tuned to the appropriate absorption lines of a particular gas, DIAL measurements can be used to determine the concentration (mixing ratio) of that particular gas in the atmosphere.

Lidar signals are detected by a 45\u00b0 tilted area CCD image sensor satisfying the Scheimpflug principle. Range-resolved NO2 concentrations on a near-horizontal path are obtained by the NO2 DIAL system in the range of 0.3\u20133&nbsp;km and show good agreement with those measured by a conventional air pollution monitoring station. A detection sensitivity of \u00b1 0.9 ppbv at 95% confidence level in the region of 0.3\u20131&nbsp;km is achieved with 15-minute averaging and 700 m range resolution during hours of darkness, which allows accurate concentration measurement of ambient NO2.

Short pulses of laser light beamed from a spacecraft can reflect off tiny particles in the atmosphere and back to a telescope aligned with the spacecraft laser. By precisely timing the lidar 'echo,' and by measuring how much laser light is received by the telescope, scientists can accurately determine the location, distribution and nature of the particles.

Coherent systems generally use [[optical heterodyne detection]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Laser - Surface Interactions|last=Rashid A.

Micropulse systems utilize intermittent bursts of energy. They developed as a result of ever-increasing computer power, combined with advances in laser technology. They use considerably less energy in the laser, typically on the order of one [[Joule#Microjoule|microjoule]], and are often \"eye-safe\", meaning they can be used without safety precautions. High-power systems are common in atmospheric research, where they are widely used for measuring atmospheric parameters: the height, layering and densities of clouds, cloud particle properties ([[refractive index#Dispersion and absorption|extinction coefficient]], backscatter coefficient, [[depolarization]]), temperature, pressure, wind, humidity, and trace gas concentration (ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, etc.).<ref name=\"cracknell\" />\n\n== Components ==\n\nLidar systems consist of several major components.\n\n=== Laser ===\n600\u20131000 [[nanometre|nm]] [[laser]]s are most common for non-scientific applications. The maximum power of the laser is limited, or an automatic shut off system which turns the laser off at specific altitudes is used in order to make it eye safe for the people in the ground.\n\nOne common alternative, 1550&nbsp;nm lasers, are eye-safe at relatively high power levels since this wavelength is not strongly absorbed by the eye, but the detector technology is less advanced and so these wavelengths are generally used at longer ranges with lower accuracies. They are also used for military applications because 1550&nbsp;nm is not visible in [[Night vision device|night vision goggles]], unlike the shorter 1000&nbsp;nm infrared laser.\n\nAirborne topographic mapping lidars generally use 1064&nbsp;nm diode pumped [[YAG]] lasers, while [[bathymetric]] (underwater depth research) systems generally use 532&nbsp;nm frequency doubled diode pumped YAG lasers because 532&nbsp;nm penetrates water with much less [[attenuation]] than does 1064&nbsp;nm. Laser settings include the laser repetition rate (which controls the data collection speed). Pulse length is generally an attribute of the laser cavity length, the number of passes required through the gain material (YAG, [[YLF]], etc.), and [[Q-switch]] (pulsing) speed. Better target resolution is achieved with shorter pulses, provided the lidar receiver detectors and electronics have sufficient bandwidth.<ref name=\"cracknell\" />\n\n==== Flash lidar ====\nThe focal plane of a Flash lidar camera has rows and columns of pixels with ample \"depth\" and \"intensity\" to create 3D landscape models.<ref name=\":12\" /> Each pixel records the time it takes each laser pulse to hit the target and return to the sensor, as well as the depth, location, and reflective intensity of the object being contacted by the laser pulse.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nFlash uses a single light source that illuminates the field of view in a single pulse, like a camera that takes pictures of distance, instead of colors.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/solid-state-lidar-for-self-driving-cars/|title=A self-driving car in every driveway?

Controlling the timing (phase) of each antenna steers a cohesive signal in a specific direction.\n\n[[Phased array]]s have been used in [[radar]] since the 1950s. The same technique can be used with light. On the order of a million optical antennas are used to see a radiation pattern of a certain size in a certain direction. The system is controlled by timing the precise flash. A single chip (or a few) replace a $75,000 electromechanical system, drastically reducing costs.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nSeveral companies are working on developing commercial solid-state lidar units, including the company [[Quanergy]] which is designing a 905&nbsp;nm solid state device, although they appear to be having some issues in development.<ref name=\"ars 2019\">{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/the-ars-technica-guide-to-the-lidar-industry/ |title=How 10 leading companies are trying to make powerful, low-cost lidar |website=[[Ars Technica]] |date=1 February 2019 |author=Lee, Timothy B.}}</ref>\n\nThe control system can change the shape of the lens to enable zoom in/zoom out functions.

However, their tiny form factor provides many of the same cost benefits. A single laser is directed to a single mirror that can be reoriented to view any part of the target field. The mirror spins at a rapid rate. However, MEMS systems generally operate in a single plane (left to right). To add a second dimension generally requires a second mirror that moves up and down. Alternatively, another laser can hit the same mirror from another angle. MEMS systems can be disrupted by shock/vibration and may require repeated calibration. The goal is to create a small microchip to enhance innovation and further technological advances.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Scanner and optics ===\nImage development speed is affected by the speed at which they are scanned. Options to scan the [[azimuth]] and elevation include dual oscillating plane mirrors, a combination with a polygon mirror and a [[Laser scanning|dual axis scanner]]. Optic choices affect the angular resolution and range that can be detected. A hole mirror or a [[beam splitter]] are options to collect a return signal.\n\n=== Photodetector and receiver electronics ===\nTwo main [[photodetector]] technologies are used in lidar: [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid state]] photodetectors, such as silicon avalanche [[photodiode]]s, or [[photomultiplier]]s. The sensitivity of the receiver is another parameter that has to be balanced in a lidar design.\n\n=== Position and navigation systems ===\nLidar sensors mounted on mobile platforms such as airplanes or satellites require instrumentation to determine the absolute position and orientation of the sensor. Such devices generally include a [[Global Positioning System]] receiver and an [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU).\n\n=== Sensor ===\n[[File:LiDAR_Scanner_and_Back_Camera_of_iPad_Pro_2020_-_3.jpg|thumb|The lidar scanner on the fourth-generation [[iPad Pro]]|alt=]]\n\nLidar uses active sensors that supply their own illumination source. The energy source hits objects and the reflected energy is detected and measured by sensors. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between transmitted and backscattered pulses and by using the speed of light to calculate the distance traveled.<ref name=\"NASA\">{{Cite web|url=https://earthdata.nasa.gov/user-resources/remote-sensors#hyperspectral|title=Remote Sensors {{!}} Earthdata|website=earthdata.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-03-18}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Flash LIDAR allows for 3D imaging because of the camera's ability to emit a larger flash and sense the spatial relationships and dimensions of area of interest with the returned energy.

Research has begun for virtual beam steering using [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP) technology.\n\nImaging lidar can also be performed using arrays of high speed detectors and modulation sensitive detector arrays typically built on single chips using [[complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (CMOS) and hybrid CMOS/[[Charge-coupled device]] (CCD) fabrication techniques.

This is currently the most detailed and accurate method of creating [[digital elevation model]]s, replacing [[photogrammetry]]. One major advantage in comparison with photogrammetry is the ability to filter out reflections from vegetation from the point cloud model to create a [[Digital Terrain Model|digital terrain model]] which represents ground surfaces such as rivers, paths, cultural heritage sites, etc., which are concealed by trees. Within the category of airborne lidar, there is sometimes a distinction made between high-altitude and low-altitude applications, but the main difference is a reduction in both accuracy and point density of data acquired at higher altitudes. Airborne lidar can also be used to create bathymetric models in shallow water.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Airborne laser bathymetry for documentation of submerged archaeological sites in shallow water|journal = ISPRS \u2013 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences|pages = 99\u2013107|volume = XL-5/W5|doi = 10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-5-w5-99-2015|first = M.|last = Doneus|first2 = I.|last2 = Miholjek|first3 = G.|last3 = Mandlburger|first4 = N.|last4 = Doneus|first5 = G.|last5 = Verhoeven|first6 = Ch.|last6 = Briese|first7 = M.|last7 = Pregesbauer|bibcode = 2015ISPArXL55...99D |year = 2015|doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\nThe main constituents of airborne lidar include [[digital elevation model]]s (DEM) and digital surface models (DSM). The points and ground points are the vectors of discrete points while DEM and DSM are interpolated raster grids of discrete points. The process also involves capturing of digital aerial photographs. In order to interpret deep-seated landslides for example, under the cover of vegetation, scarps, tension cracks or tipped trees airborne lidar is used. Airborne lidar digital elevation models can see through the canopy of forest cover, perform detailed measurements of scarps, erosion and tilting of electric poles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiu|first=Cheng-Lung|last2=Fei|first2=Li-Yuan|last3=Liu|first3=Jin-King|last4=Wu|first4=Ming-Chee|title=National Airborne Lidar Mapping and Examples for applications in deep-seated landslides in Taiwan|journal=Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2015 IEEE International|issn= 2153-7003|volume=}}</ref>\n\nAirborne lidar data is processed using a toolbox called Toolbox for Lidar Data Filtering and Forest Studies (TIFFS)<ref name=\":10\" /> for lidar data filtering and terrain study software. The data is interpolated to digital terrain models using the software. The laser is directed at the region to be mapped and each point's height above the ground is calculated by subtracting the original z-coordinate from the corresponding digital terrain model elevation. Based on this height above the ground the non-vegetation data is obtained which may include objects such as buildings, electric power lines, flying birds, insects, etc. The rest of the points are treated as vegetation and used for modeling and mapping. Within each of these plots, lidar metrics are calculated by calculating statistics such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, percentiles, quadratic mean, etc.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Yuan|first=Zeng|last2=Yujin|first2=Zhao|last3=Dan|first3=Zhao|last4=Bingfang|first4=Wu|title=Forest Biodiversity mapping using airborne and hyper-spectral data|journal=Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2016 IEEE International |issn=2153-7003|volume=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Airborne Lidar Bathymetric Technology.jpg|thumb|Airborne Lidar Bathymetric Technology-High-resolution multibeam lidar map showing spectacularly faulted and deformed seafloor geology, in shaded relief and coloured by depth.]]\n\n===== Airborne lidar bathymetry =====\nThe airborne lidar [[bathymetric]] technological system involves the measurement of time of flight of a signal from a source to its return to the sensor. The data acquisition technique involves a sea floor mapping component and a ground truth component that includes video transects and sampling. It works using a green spectrum (532&nbsp;nm) laser beam.<ref>[https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/corbin/class_description/Nayegandhi_green_lidar.pdf Nayegandhi Green Lidar]</ref> Two beams are projected onto a fast rotating mirror, which creates an array of points. One of the beams penetrates the water and also detects the bottom surface of the water under favorable conditions.\n\nThe data obtained shows the full extent of the land surface exposed above the sea floor. This technique is extremely useful as it will play an important role in the major sea floor mapping program. The mapping yields onshore topography as well as underwater elevations. Sea floor reflectance imaging is another solution product from this system which can benefit mapping of underwater habitats. This technique has been used for three-dimensional image mapping of California's waters using a hydrographic lidar.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book |isbn=978-1-4244-2126-8 |doi=10.1109/OCEANSKOBE.2008.4530980|chapter=Using Airborne Hydrographic LiDAR to Support Mapping of California's Waters|title=OCEANS 2008 - MTS/IEEE Kobe Techno-Ocean|pages=1\u20138|year=2008|last1=Wilson|first1=Jerry C.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Yellowscan LIDAR on OnyxStar FOX-C8 HD.jpg|thumb|Lidar scanning performed with a multicopter [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]].]]\n[[Drone aircraft|Drones]] are now being used with laser scanners, as well as other remote sensors, as a more economical method to scan smaller areas.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Drone remote sensing for forestry research and practices|journal = Journal of Forestry Research|date = 2015-06-21|issn = 1007-662X|pages = 791\u2013797|volume = 26|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s11676-015-0088-y |first = Lina|last = Tang|first2 = Guofan|last2 = Shao}}</ref> The possibility of drone remote sensing also eliminates any danger that crews of a manned aircraft may be subjected to in difficult terrain or remote areas.\n\n==== Terrestrial  ====\nTerrestrial applications of lidar (also ''terrestrial laser scanning'') happen on the Earth's surface and can be either stationary or mobile. Stationary terrestrial scanning is most common as a survey method, for example in conventional topography, monitoring, cultural heritage documentation and forensics.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[Point cloud|3-D point clouds]] acquired from these types of scanners can be matched with digital images taken of the scanned area from the scanner's location to create realistic looking 3-D models in a relatively short time when compared to other technologies. Each point in the point cloud is given the colour of the pixel from the image taken located at the same angle as the laser beam that created the point.\n\nMobile lidar (also ''mobile laser scanning'') is when two or more scanners are attached to a moving vehicle to collect data along a path. These scanners are almost always paired with other kinds of equipment, including [[Satellite navigation|GNSS]] receivers and [[Inertial measurement unit|IMUs]]. One example application is surveying streets, where power lines, exact bridge heights, bordering trees, etc. all need to be taken into account. Instead of collecting each of these measurements individually in the field with a [[Tachymeter (survey)|tachymeter]], a 3-D model from a point cloud can be created where all of the measurements needed can be made, depending on the quality of the data collected. This eliminates the problem of forgetting to take a measurement, so long as the model is available, reliable and has an appropriate level of accuracy.\n\nTerrestrial lidar mapping involves a process of occupancy grid map generation. The process involves an array of cells divided into grids which employ a process to store the height values when lidar data falls into the respective grid cell. A binary map is then created by applying a particular threshold to the cell values for further processing. The next step is to process the radial distance and z-coordinates from each scan to identify which 3-D points correspond to each of the specified grid cell leading to the process of data formation.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sang-Mook|last2=Joon Im|first2=Jeong|last3=Lee|first3=Bo-Hee|last4=Leonessa|first4=Alexander|last5=Kurdila|first5=Andrew|title=A real time grid-map generation and object classification for ground based 3D lidar data using image analysis techniques|journal=Image Processing (ICIP), 2010 17th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing |issn= 1522-4880|volume=}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:LIDAR equipped mobile robot.jpg|thumb|This [[mobile robot]] uses its lidar to construct a map and avoid obstacles.]]\n\nThere are a wide variety of applications for lidar, in addition to the applications listed below, as it is often mentioned in [[National lidar dataset]] programs.\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:LIDAR field yield.jpg|thumb|alt=Graphic of a lidar return, featuring different crop yield rates.|Lidar is used to analyze yield rates on agricultural fields.]]\n\n[[Agricultural robot]]s have been used for a variety of purposes ranging from seed and fertilizer dispersions, sensing techniques as well as crop scouting for the task of weed control.\n\nLidar can help determine where to apply costly fertilizer.

Lidar sensors can detect the edges of rows, so that farming equipment can continue moving until GPS signal is reestablished.\n\n==== Plant species classification ====\nControlling weeds requires identifying plant species.

This data is transformed, and features are extracted from it. If the species is known, the features are added as new data. The species is labelled and its features are initially stored as an example to identify the species in the real environment. This method is efficient because it uses a low-resolution lidar and supervised learning. It includes an easy-to-compute feature set with common statistical features which are independent of the plant size.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===Archaeology===\nLidar has many uses in archaeology, including planning of field campaigns, mapping features under forest canopy, and overview of broad, continuous features indistinguishable from the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/whitecourt.htm |title=EID; crater beneath canopy |publisher=Unb.ca |date=2013-02-18 |accessdate=2013-05-06}}</ref> Lidar can produce high-resolution datasets quickly and cheaply. Lidar-derived products can be easily integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) for analysis and interpretation.\n\nLidar can also help to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) of archaeological sites that can reveal micro-topography that is otherwise hidden by vegetation. The intensity of the returned lidar signal can be used to detect features buried under flat vegetated surfaces such as fields, especially when mapping using the infrared spectrum. The presence of these features affects plant growth and thus the amount of infrared light reflected back.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/light-fantastic/|title=The Light Fantastic: Using airborne lidar in archaeological survey|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year=2010|page=45|authorlink=English Heritage}}</ref> For example, at [[Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] \u2013 Fort Cumberland National Historic Site, Canada, lidar discovered archaeological features related to the siege of the Fort in 1755.

In heavy rain, for example, the light pulses emitted from the lidar system are partially reflected off of rain droplets which adds noise to the data, called 'echoes'.<ref>{{Cite book|title= 2016 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)|pages=2242\u20132247|language=en-US|doi=10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795918|chapter= Test methodology for rain influence on automotive surround sensors|year=2016|last1=Hasirlioglu|first1=Sinan|last2=Kamann|first2=Alexander|last3=Doric|first3=Igor|last4=Brandmeier|first4=Thomas|isbn=978-1-5090-1889-5}}</ref>\n\nBelow mentioned are various approaches of processing lidar data and using it along with data from other sensors through sensor fusion to detect the vehicle environment conditions.\n\n===== GRID based processing using 3-D lidar and fusion with radar measurement =====\nIn this method, proposed by Philipp Lindner and Gerd Wanielik, laser data is processed using a multidimensional occupancy grid.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Lindner|first=Philipp|last2=Wanielik|first2=Gerd|title=3D LIDAR Processing for Vehicle Safety and Environment Recognition|journal=IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Vehicles and Vehicular Systems |year=2009 |isbn= 978-1-4244-2770-3|volume=|doi=10.1109/CIVVS.2009.4938725}}</ref> Data from a four-layer laser is pre-processed at the signal level and then processed at a higher level to extract the features of the obstacles. A combination two- and three-dimensional grid structure is used and the space in these structures is [[Tessellation|tessellated]] into several discrete cells. This method allows a huge amount of raw measurement data to be effectively handled by collecting it in spatial containers, the cells of the evidence grid. Each cell is associated with a probability measure that identifies the cell occupation. This probability is calculated by using the range measurement of the lidar sensor obtained over time and a new range measurement, which are related using [[Bayes' theorem]]. A two-dimensional grid can observe an obstacle in front of it, but cannot observe the space behind the obstacle. To address this, the unknown state behind the obstacle is assigned a probability of 0.5. By introducing the third dimension or in other terms using a multi-layer laser, the spatial configuration of an object could be mapped into the grid structure to a degree of complexity. This is achieved by transferring the measurement points into a three-dimensional grid. The grid cells which are occupied will possess a probability greater than 0.5 and the mapping would be color-coded based on the probability. The cells that are not occupied will possess a probability less than 0.5 and this area will usually be white space. This measurement is then transformed to a grid coordinate system by using the sensor position on the vehicle and the vehicle position in the world coordinate system. The coordinates of the sensor depend upon its location on the vehicle and the coordinates of the vehicle are computed using [[Visual odometry#Egomotion|egomotion]] estimation, which is estimating the vehicle motion relative to a rigid scene. For this method, the grid profile must be defined. The grid cells touched by the transmitted laser beam are calculated by applying [[Bresenham's line algorithm]]. To obtain the spatially extended structure, a connected component analysis of these cells is performed. This information is then passed on to a [[Rotating calipers|rotating caliper]] algorithm to obtain the spatial characteristics of the object. In addition to the lidar detection, RADAR data obtained by using two short-range radars is integrated to get additional dynamic properties of the object, such as its velocity. The measurements are assigned to the object using a potential distance function.\n\n; Advantages and disadvantages \nThe geometric features of the objects are extracted efficiently, from the measurements obtained by the 3-D occupancy grid, using rotating caliper algorithm. Fusing the radar data to the lidar measurements give information about the dynamic properties of the obstacle such as velocity and location of the obstacle with respect to the sensor location which helps the vehicle or the driver decide the action to be performed in order to ensure safety. The only concern is the computational requirement to implement this data processing technique. It can be implemented in real time and has been proven efficient if the 3-D occupancy grid size is considerably restricted. But this can be improved to an even wider range by using dedicated spatial data structures that manipulate the spatial data more effectively, for the 3-D grid representation.\n\n===== Fusion of 3-D lidar and color camera for multiple object detection and tracking =====\nThe framework proposed in this method by Soonmin Hwang et al.,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hwang|first=Soonmin|last2=Kim|first2=Namil|last3=Choi|first3=Yukyung|last4=Lee|first4=Seokju|last5=So Kweon|first5=In|title=Fast Multiple Objects Detection and Tracking Fusing Color Camera and 3D LIDAR for Intelligent Vehicles|journal=13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI) |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-5090-0821-6|volume=}}</ref> is split into four steps. First, the data from the camera and 3-D lidar is input into the system. Both inputs from lidar and camera are parallelly obtained and the color image from the camera is calibrated with the lidar. To improve the efficiency, horizontal 3-D point sampling is applied as pre-processing. Second, the segmentation stage is where the entire 3-D points are divided into several groups per the distance from the sensor and local planes from close plane to far plane are sequentially estimated. The local planes are estimated using statistical analysis. The group of points closer to the sensor are used to compute the initial plane. By using the current local plane, the next local plane is estimated by an iterative update. The object proposals in the 2-D image are used to separate foreground objects from background. For faster and accurate detection and tracking Binarized Normed Gradients for Objectness Estimation at 300fps is used.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cheng|first=Ming-Ming|last2=Zhang|first2=Ziming|last3=Lin|first3=Wen-Yan|last4=Torr|first4=Philip|title=BING: Binarized normed gradients for objectness estimation at 300fps|journal=IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition |year=2014 |isbn= 978-1-4799-5118-5|volume=}}</ref> BING is a combination of normed gradient and its binarized version which speeds up the feature extraction and testing process, to estimate the objectness of an image window. This way the foreground and background objects are separated. To form objects after estimating the objectness of an image using BING, the 3-D points are grouped or clustered. Clustering is done using [[DBSCAN]] (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm which could be robust due to its less-parametric characteristic. Using the clustered 3-D points, i.e. 3-D segment, more accurate region-of-interests (RoIs) are generated by projecting 3-D points on the 2-D image. The third step is detection, which is broadly divided into two parts. First is object detection in 2-D image which is achieved using Fast R-CNN<ref>{{Cite book|last=Girshick|first=Ross |year= 2015 |isbn= 978-1-4673-8391-2|volume=|pages=1440\u20131448|doi=10.1109/ICCV.2015.169|chapter=Fast R-CNN |title=2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) }}</ref> as this method doesn't need training and it also considers an image and several regions of interest. Second is object detection in 3-D space that is done by using the spin image method.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=E. Johnson|first=Andrew|last2=Hebert|first2=Martial|title=Using spin images for efficient object recognition in cluttered 3D scenes|journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |year=1999 |issn=0162-8828|volume=21|issue=5|pages=433\u2013449|doi=10.1109/34.765655|url=http://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/publications/Andrew_Johnson/aejPAMI1999.pdf}}</ref> This method extracts local and global histograms to represent a certain object. To merge the results of 2-D image and 3-D space object detection, same 3-D region is considered and two independent classifiers from 2-D image and 3-D space are applied to the considered region. Scores calibration<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Philippe|last2=Davoine|first2=Franck|last3=Denoeux|first3=Thierry|title=Evidential combination of pedestrian detectors|journal=Proceedings British Machine Vision Conference, BMVA Press |date= September 2014|volume=}}</ref> is done to get a single confidence score from both detectors. This single score is obtained in the form of probability. The final step is tracking. This is done by associating moving objects in present and past frame. For object tracking, segment matching is adopted. Features such as mean, standard deviation, quantized color histograms, volume size and number of 3-D points of a segment are computed. Euclidean distance is used to measure differences between segments. To judge the appearance and disappearance of an object, similar segments (obtained based on the Euclidean distance) from two different frames are taken and the physical distance and dissimilarity scores are calculated. If the scores go beyond a range for every segment in the previous frame, the object being tracked is considered to have disappeared.\n\n; Advantages and disadvantages \nThe advantages of this method are using 2-D image and 3-D data together, F l-score (which gives a measure of test's accuracy), average precision (AP) are higher than that when only 3-D data from lidar is used. These scores are conventional measurements which judge the framework. The drawback of this method is the usage of BING for object proposal estimation as BING predicts a small set of object bounding boxes.\n\n===== Obstacle detection and road environment recognition using lidar =====\nThis method proposed by Kun Zhou et al.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Zhou|first=Kun|last2=Wang|first2=Xiqin|last3=Tomizukat|first3=Masayoshi|last4=Zhang|first4=Wei-Bin|last5=Chant|first5=Ching-Yao|title=A New Manoeuvring Target Tracking Algorithm with Input Estimation|journal=Proceedings of the 2002 American Control Conference |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-7803-7298-6|volume=|doi=10.1109/ACC.2002.1024798|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1263011}}</ref> not only focuses on object detection and tracking but also recognizes lane marking and road features. As mentioned earlier the lidar systems use rotating hexagonal mirrors that split the laser beam into six beams. The upper three layers are used to detect the forward objects such as vehicles and roadside objects. The sensor is made of weather-resistant material. The data detected by lidar are clustered to several segments and tracked by [[Kalman filter]]. Data clustering here is done based on characteristics of each segment based on object model, which distinguish different objects such as vehicles, signboards, etc. These characteristics include the dimensions of the object, etc. The reflectors on the rear edges of vehicles are used to differentiate vehicles from other objects. Object tracking is done using a 2-stage Kalman filter considering the stability of tracking and the accelerated motion of objects<ref name=\":4\" /> Lidar reflective intensity data is also used for curb detection by making use of robust regression to deal with occlusions. The road marking is detected using a modified Otsu method by distinguishing rough and shiny surfaces.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Y. Hata|first=Alberto|last2=F.

Therefore, other information is needed to recognize the road border. The lidar used in this method can measure the reflectivity from the object. Hence, with this data road border can also be recognized. Also, the usage of sensor with weather-robust head helps detecting the objects even in bad weather conditions. Canopy Height Model before and after flood is a good example. Lidar can detect high detailed canopy height data as well as its road border.\n\nLidar measurements help identify the spatial structure of the obstacle. This helps distinguish objects based on size and estimate the impact of driving over it.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nLidar systems provide better range and a large field of view which helps detecting obstacles on the curves. This is one major advantage over RADAR systems which have a narrower field of view. The fusion of lidar measurement with different sensors makes the system robust and useful in real-time applications, since lidar dependent systems can't estimate the dynamic information about the detected object.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIt has been shown that lidar can be manipulated, such that self-driving cars are tricked into taking evasive action.<ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/07/hackers-trick-self-driving-cars-lidar-sensor|title=Hackers can trick self-driving cars into taking evasive action|journal=The Guardian|first=Samuel|last=Gibbs|date=7 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Biology and conservation===\n[[File:Forest LIDAR.jpg|thumb|Lidar imaging comparing old-growth forest (right) to a new plantation of trees (left)]]\nLidar has also found many applications in [[forestry]]. [[canopy (forest)|Canopy]] heights, [[biomass]] measurements, and leaf area can all be studied using airborne lidar systems. Similarly, lidar is also used by many industries, including Energy and Railroad, and the Department of Transportation as a faster way of surveying. Topographic maps can also be generated readily from lidar, including for recreational use such as in the production of [[orienteering]] maps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lidarbasemaps.org |title=Lidar Links of Use in Mapping |website=Lidarbasemaps.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-22}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the [[Save the Redwoods League]] has undertaken a project to map the tall redwoods on the Northern California coast. Lidar allows research scientists to not only measure the height of previously unmapped trees, but to determine the biodiversity of the redwood forest. [[Stephen Sillett]], who is working with the League on the North Coast lidar project, claims this technology will be useful in directing future efforts to preserve and protect ancient redwood trees.<ref>Councillor Quarterly, Summer 2007 Volume 6 Issue 3</ref>{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Geology and soil science===\nHigh-resolution [[digital elevation map]]s generated by airborne and stationary lidar have led to significant advances in [[geomorphology]] (the branch of geoscience concerned with the origin and evolution of the Earth surface topography). The lidar abilities to detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks, to measure the land-surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy, to better resolve spatial derivatives of elevation, and to detect elevation changes between repeat surveys have enabled many novel studies of the physical and chemical processes that shape landscapes.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Hughes, M.

Lidar technology has since expanded vastly in capability and lidar systems are used to perform a range of measurements that include profiling clouds, measuring winds, studying aerosols, and quantifying various atmospheric components. Atmospheric components can in turn provide useful information including surface pressure (by measuring the absorption of oxygen or nitrogen), greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide and methane), photosynthesis (carbon dioxide), fires (carbon monoxide), and humidity (water vapor). [[Atmospheric lidar]]s can be either ground-based, airborne or satellite depending on the type of measurement.\n\nAtmospheric lidar remote sensing works in two ways \u2013 \n# by measuring backscatter from the atmosphere, and \n# by measuring the scattered reflection off the ground (when the lidar is airborne) or other hard surface.\n\nBackscatter from the atmosphere directly gives a measure of clouds and aerosols. Other derived measurements from backscatter such as winds or cirrus ice crystals require careful selecting of the wavelength and/or polarization detected. ''Doppler lidar'' and ''Rayleigh Doppler lidar'' are used to measure temperature and/or wind speed along the beam by measuring the frequency of the backscattered light. The [[Doppler broadening]] of gases in motion allows the determination of properties via the resulting frequency shift.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Li | year = 2011 | first1 = T. |title = Middle atmosphere temperature trend and solar cycle revealed by long-term Rayleigh lidar observations |journal = J.

Laser emissions at the on-line and off-line wavelengths of the NO2 absorption spectrum are implemented by tuning the injection current of the laser diode. Lidar signals are detected by a 45\u00b0 tilted area CCD image sensor satisfying the Scheimpflug principle. Range-resolved NO2 concentrations on a near-horizontal path are obtained by the NO2 DIAL system in the range of 0.3\u20133&nbsp;km and show good agreement with those measured by a conventional air pollution monitoring station. A detection sensitivity of \u00b1 0.9 ppbv at 95% confidence level in the region of 0.3\u20131&nbsp;km is achieved with 15-minute averaging and 700 m range resolution during hours of darkness, which allows accurate concentration measurement of ambient NO2. The low-cost and robust DIAL system demonstrated in this work opens up many possibilities for field NO2 remote sensing applications.<ref>Liang Mei, Peng Guan, and Zheng Kong, \"Remote sensing of atmospheric NO2 by employing the continuous-wave differential absorption lidar technique,\" Opt.

Even only running while directly queried or while the computer was idled, indexing the entire hard drive still took hours. The index would be around 10% of the size of all the files that it indexed, e.g. if the indexed files amounted to around 100GB, the index size would be 10GB.\n\nWith the release of [[Windows Vista]] came [[Windows Search]]  3.1. Unlike its predecessors WDS and Windows Search 3.0, 3.1 could search through both indexed and non indexed locations seamlessly. Also, the [[RAM]] and [[CPU]] requirements were greatly reduced, cutting back indexing times immensely. Windows Search 4.0 is currently running on all PCs with [[Windows 7]] and up.\n\n=== Mac OS ===\nIn 1994 the [[AppleSearch]] search engine was introduced, allowing users to fully search all documents within their Macintosh computer, including file format types, meta-data on those files, and content within the files. AppleSearch was a [[Client\u2013server model|client/server application]], and as such required a server separate from the main device in order to function. The biggest issue with AppleSearch were its large resource requirements: \"AppleSearch requires at least a 68040 processor and 5MB of RAM.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infomotions.com/musings/tricks/manuscript/1600-0001.html|title=AppleSearch|work=infomotions.com|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref> At the time, a Macintosh computer with these specifications was priced at approximately $1400; equivalent to $2050 in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.areppim.com/calc/calc_usdlrxdeflator.php|title=Converter of current to real US dollars - using the GDP deflator|author=eduardo casais|work=areppim.com|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref> On top of this, the software itself cost an additional $1400 for a single license.\n\nIn 1997, [[Sherlock (software)|Sherlock]] was released alongside Mac OS 8.5. Sherlock (named after the famous fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]]) was integrated into Mac OS's file browser&nbsp;\u2013 [[Finder (software)|Finder]]. Sherlock extended the desktop search function to the World Wide Web, allowing users to search both locally and externally. Adding additional functions\u2014such as internet access\u2014to Sherlock was relatively simple, as this was done through plugins written as plain text files. Sherlock was included in every release of Mac OS from [[Mac OS 8]], before being deprecated and replaced by [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]] and [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]] in [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger]]. It was officially removed in [[Mac OS X Leopard|Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard]]\n\n[[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]] was released in 2005 as part of [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger]]. It is a Selection-based search tool, which means the user invokes a query using only the mouse. Spotlight allows the user to search the Internet for more information about any keyword or phrase contained within a document or webpage, and uses a built-in calculator and Oxford American Dictionary to offer quick access to small calculations and word definitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/04/12Apple-to-Ship-Mac-OS-X-Tiger-on-April-29.html|title=Apple - Press Info - Apple to Ship Mac OS X \"Tiger\" on April 29|work=apple.com|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref> While Spotlight initially has a long startup time, this decreases as the hard disk is indexed. As files are added by the user, the index is constantly updated in the background using minimal CPU & RAM resources.\n\n=== Linux ===\nThere are a wide range of desktop search options for Linux users, depending upon the skill level of the user, their preference to use desktop tools which tightly integrate into their desktop environment, command-shell functionality (often with advanced scripting options), or browser-based users interfaces to locally running software.  In addition, many users create their own indexing from a variety of indexing packages (e.g. one which does extraction and indexing of PDF/DOC/DOCX/[[OpenDocument|ODT]] documents well, another search engine which works w/ vcard, LDAP, and other directory/contact databases, as well as the conventional <tt>find</tt> and <tt>locate</tt> commands.\n\n====Ubuntu====\n[[Ubuntu distribution|Ubuntu Linux]] didn't have desktop search until release [[Ubuntu version history#Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn)|Feisty Fawn 7.04]]. Using [[Tracker (search software)|Tracker]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/07/afirst-look-at-tracker-0-6-0/|title=A first look at Tracker 0.6.0|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref> desktop search, the desktop search feature was very similar to Mac OS's AppleSearch and Sherlock. It not only featured the basic features of file format sorting and meta-data matching, but support for searching through emails and instant messages was added. In 2014 [[Recoll]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/usermanual/index.html#RCL.INDEXING|title=Recoll user manual|work=lesbonscomptes.com|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref> was added to Linux distributions, working with other search programs such as Tracker and [[Beagle (software)|Beagle]] to provide efficient full text search. This greatly increased the types of queries and file types that Linux desktop searches could handle. A major advantage of Recoll is that it allows for greater customization of what is indexed; Recoll will index the entire hard disk by default, but can be made to index only selected directories, omitting directories that will never need to be searched.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive09.linux.com/feature/114283|title=Linux.com|work=linux.com|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n====[[openSUSE]]<ref>http://www.opensuse.org/</ref>====\n<!--TODO! Prior desktop search before KDE 3.5-->\nStarting with [[KDE4]], the [[NEPOMUK (software)|NEPOMUK]] was introduced.  It provided the ability to index a wide range of desktop content, email, and use semantic web technologies (e.g. [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]) to annotate the database.  The introduction faced a few glitches, much of which seemed to be based on the [[triplestore]].  Performance improved (at least for queries) by switching the backend to a stripped-down version of the [[Virtuoso]] Open Source Edition, however indexing remained a common user complaint.\nBased on user feedback, the Nepomuk indexing and search has been replaced with the Baloo framework<ref>https://community.kde.org/Baloo</ref> based on [[Xapian]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of search engines#Desktop search engines|List of desktop search engines]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Navigationbox Desktopsearch}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Desktop Search}}\n[[Category:Desktop search engines| ]]\n[[Category:Information retrieval genres]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{technical|date=October 2014}}\n{{manual||date=October 2016}}\n}}\n[[File:AdunaAutoFocus5.png|thumb|OSL Desktop Search engines software Aduna AutoFocus 5]]\n'''Desktop search''' tools search within a user's own [[computer files]] as opposed to searching the Internet.

The biggest issue with AppleSearch were its large resource requirements: \"AppleSearch requires at least a 68040 processor and 5MB of RAM.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infomotions.com/musings/tricks/manuscript/1600-0001.html|title=AppleSearch|work=infomotions.com|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref> At the time, a Macintosh computer with these specifications was priced at approximately $1400; equivalent to $2050 in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.areppim.com/calc/calc_usdlrxdeflator.php|title=Converter of current to real US dollars - using the GDP deflator|author=eduardo casais|work=areppim.com|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref> On top of this, the software itself cost an additional $1400 for a single license.\n\nIn 1997, [[Sherlock (software)|Sherlock]] was released alongside Mac OS 8.5. Sherlock (named after the famous fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]]) was integrated into Mac OS's file browser&nbsp;\u2013 [[Finder (software)|Finder]]. Sherlock extended the desktop search function to the World Wide Web, allowing users to search both locally and externally. Adding additional functions\u2014such as internet access\u2014to Sherlock was relatively simple, as this was done through plugins written as plain text files. Sherlock was included in every release of Mac OS from [[Mac OS 8]], before being deprecated and replaced by [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]] and [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]] in [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger]]. It was officially removed in [[Mac OS X Leopard|Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard]]\n\n[[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]] was released in 2005 as part of [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger]]. It is a Selection-based search tool, which means the user invokes a query using only the mouse. Spotlight allows the user to search the Internet for more information about any keyword or phrase contained within a document or webpage, and uses a built-in calculator and Oxford American Dictionary to offer quick access to small calculations and word definitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/04/12Apple-to-Ship-Mac-OS-X-Tiger-on-April-29.html|title=Apple - Press Info - Apple to Ship Mac OS X \"Tiger\" on April 29|work=apple.com|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref> While Spotlight initially has a long startup time, this decreases as the hard disk is indexed. As files are added by the user, the index is constantly updated in the background using minimal CPU & RAM resources.\n\n=== Linux ===\nThere are a wide range of desktop search options for Linux users, depending upon the skill level of the user, their preference to use desktop tools which tightly integrate into their desktop environment, command-shell functionality (often with advanced scripting options), or browser-based users interfaces to locally running software.  In addition, many users create their own indexing from a variety of indexing packages (e.g. one which does extraction and indexing of PDF/DOC/DOCX/[[OpenDocument|ODT]] documents well, another search engine which works w/ vcard, LDAP, and other directory/contact databases, as well as the conventional <tt>find</tt> and <tt>locate</tt> commands.\n\n====Ubuntu====\n[[Ubuntu distribution|Ubuntu Linux]] didn't have desktop search until release [[Ubuntu version history#Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn)|Feisty Fawn 7.04]]. Using [[Tracker (search software)|Tracker]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/07/afirst-look-at-tracker-0-6-0/|title=A first look at Tracker 0.6.0|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref> desktop search, the desktop search feature was very similar to Mac OS's AppleSearch and Sherlock. It not only featured the basic features of file format sorting and meta-data matching, but support for searching through emails and instant messages was added. In 2014 [[Recoll]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/usermanual/index.html#RCL.INDEXING|title=Recoll user manual|work=lesbonscomptes.com|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref> was added to Linux distributions, working with other search programs such as Tracker and [[Beagle (software)|Beagle]] to provide efficient full text search. This greatly increased the types of queries and file types that Linux desktop searches could handle. A major advantage of Recoll is that it allows for greater customization of what is indexed; Recoll will index the entire hard disk by default, but can be made to index only selected directories, omitting directories that will never need to be searched.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive09.linux.com/feature/114283|title=Linux.com|work=linux.com|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n====[[openSUSE]]<ref>http://www.opensuse.org/</ref>====\n<!--TODO! Prior desktop search before KDE 3.5-->\nStarting with [[KDE4]], the [[NEPOMUK (software)|NEPOMUK]] was introduced.  It provided the ability to index a wide range of desktop content, email, and use semantic web technologies (e.g. [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]) to annotate the database.  The introduction faced a few glitches, much of which seemed to be based on the [[triplestore]].  Performance improved (at least for queries) by switching the backend to a stripped-down version of the [[Virtuoso]] Open Source Edition, however indexing remained a common user complaint.\nBased on user feedback, the Nepomuk indexing and search has been replaced with the Baloo framework<ref>https://community.kde.org/Baloo</ref> based on [[Xapian]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of search engines#Desktop search engines|List of desktop search engines]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Navigationbox Desktopsearch}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Desktop Search}}\n[[Category:Desktop search engines| ]]\n[[Category:Information retrieval genres]]\n", "name_user": "Jarble", "label": "safe", "comment": "linking", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_search"}
