Founded in 1885, the UofA was the first university in the [[Arizona Territory]]. {{as of|2018}}, the university enrolls 45,217 students<ref name=\"Facts\"/> in 19 separate colleges/schools, including the [[University of Arizona College of Medicine]] in Tucson and Phoenix and the [[James E. Rogers College of Law]], and is affiliated with two academic medical centers ([[Banner University Medical Center Tucson|Banner - University Medical Center Tucson]] and Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix). The University of Arizona is governed by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]]. The University of Arizona is one of the elected members of the [[Association of American Universities]] and is the only representative from the state of Arizona to this group.\n\nKnown as the [[Arizona Wildcats]] (often shortened to \"Cats\"), the UA's intercollegiate athletic teams are members of the [[Pac-12 Conference]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. UA athletes have won national titles in several sports, most notably men's basketball, baseball, and softball. The official colors of the university and its athletic teams are cardinal red and navy blue.\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=March 2014}}\n[[File:OldMain UofA 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Old Main in 1889]]\nAfter the passage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862]], the push for a university in Arizona grew. The Arizona Territory's \"[[Thieving Thirteenth]]\" Legislature approved the University of Arizona in 1885 and selected the city of Tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university. Tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but it was created as Arizona's [[normal school]], and not a university).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Flooding on the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] delayed Tucson's legislators, and by they time they reached [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made. Tucson was largely disappointed with receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize. With no parties willing to provide land for the new institution, the citizens of Tucson prepared to return the money to the Territorial Legislature until two gamblers and a saloon keeper decided to donate the land to build the school.<ref name=\"History 3a\">{{cite web | title=The Founding of the University: Myths and Heroes| access-date=Aug 11, 2019 | url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/the-founding-of-the-university-myths-and-heroes}}</ref> Construction of [[Old Main, University of Arizona|Old Main]], the first building on campus, began on October 27, 1887, and classes met for the first time in 1891 with 32 students in Old Main, which is still in use today.<ref name=\"History 3\">{{cite web | title=The Old Main | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | access-date=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060211105338/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 11, 2006}}</ref> Because there were no high schools in Arizona Territory, the university maintained separate preparatory classes for the first 23 years of operation.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Academics==\nThe University of Arizona offers bachelor's, master's, doctoral, and professional degrees.

The program's requirements entail that each honors student must complete 30 credit hours of honors credit by graduation time and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.5. To complete these credit hours, students may take courses designated as honors at the University of Arizona or may turn a regular course into an [[honors course]] through an honors contract. In addition, they must collaborate with a [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] member and write an honors thesis before graduating with honors from the University of Arizona.\n\nThe University of Arizona Honors College recently completed construction on an Honors dormitory known as the Honors Village. The facility includes a meal hall, which is open to the public, classroom spaces, faculty offices, and space for 1052 student residents.\n\nThere are additional resources available to honors students in the University of Arizona Honors College. Such resources include: longer library check-out dates, cheaper printing options at the Slonaker House, priority registration, additional honors advising, smaller class sizes taught by Honors faculty, clubs and organizations specifically available to only honors students such as the Honors Student Council and the Honors College Ambassadors, and additional scholarship opportunities.

The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north-south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below).\n\nThe science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library.\n[[File:University of Arizona mall.jpg|thumb|left|University of Arizona Mall]]\n\nSpeedway Boulevard, one of Tucson's primary east-west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed north of this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes. The university has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes for student housing in recent years. Sixth Street typically defines the southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out to students) south of this street.\n\nPark Avenue has traditionally defined the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main. Along or adjacent to all of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants such as [[Chipotle]], [[Panera Bread]] and [[Pei Wei Asian Diner|Pei Wei]]. The area near University Boulevard and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail activity going back to the university's early decades; many shops dating from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel was built in this immediate district in 1996.

Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in [[ice hockey]]. The school's club hockey team, formerly known as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey|Icecats]], won over 800 games between its inception in 1979 and 2011. The Icecats defeated [[Penn State]] for the National Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985.

Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first [[NCAA]] Championship in men and women's swimming and diving for the seasons of 2007\u20132008. Topping off these weekends [[Frank Busch]], the men and women's head coach, was named [[NCAA]] Swimming Coach of the Year. Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA's win in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn's winning streak since 1998. At the end of the meet, the [[Texas Longhorns swimming and diving|Texas Longhorns]] took second while 2007's champion, the [[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn Tigers]], took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007's defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona's women did not let anyone come close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while the Auburn Tigers came in second with 348 and the [[Stanford Cardinal]] in third with 343. Student-athletes from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA. The [[NCAA Woman of the Year Award]] was won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/events/awards/1994-ncaa-woman-year|title=1994 NCAA Woman of the Year|last=jjackson|date=June 30, 2015|newspaper=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Individual national championships===\nA number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Arizona's first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium. Some other champion swimmers include [[Crissy Ahmann-Leighton]], [[Ryk Neethling]], [[Margo Geer]], [[Kevin Cordes]], and [[Amanda Beard]]. [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] won in 1991 in golf, and [[Brigetta Barrett]] won the women's high jump in 2013. The men's [[Cross country running|cross country]] has also produced two individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) ([[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship|NCAA Men's Cross Country Champions]]). The women's cross country also produced two individual national titles in 1996 (Amy Skieresz) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) ([[NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship]]). Another notable individual was football standout [[Vance Johnson]] who won the NCAA long jump in 1982.\n\n===Rivalries===\nA strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], Arizona. The University of Arizona leads the all-time record against Arizona State University in men's basketball (149\u201383), as well as in football (49\u201342\u20131). The football rivalry game between the schools is known as \"The Duel in the Desert.\" The trophy awarded after each game, the [[Territorial Cup]], is the nation's oldest rivalry trophy, distinguished by the NCAA. Rivalries have also been created with other [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] teams, especially [[University of California, Los Angeles]] which has provided a worthy [[softball]] rival and was Arizona's main basketball rival in the early and mid-1990s.\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Wilma & Wilber Wildcat in the bucket of Tucson Fire Department ladder truck 1.JPG|thumb|Wilma & Wilbur Wildcat at the 100th homecoming at the University of Arizona]]\nThe university's mascots are a pair of [[anthropomorphized]] [[Bobcat|wildcats]] named [[Wilbur and Wilma]].

From 1915 through the 1950s the school mascot was a live [[bobcat]], a species known locally as a wildcat. This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university from 1914 to 1921. 1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear. Ed Stuckenhoff was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition. Wilbur celebrated his 50th birthday in November 2009.\n\n===Fight song===\nIn 1952 Jack K.

From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading \"BEAR DOWN.\" Inspired, Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song. By the time his plane landed, he had virtually finished it. A few weeks later Lee was named the UA band director, and in September 1952, the UA band performed \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" in public for the first time. Soon thereafter, \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" became accepted as UA's fight song ([[Bear Down]]).<ref name=\"Berger Memorial Fountain\">{{cite web | title=Berger Memorial Fountain | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060504055919/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===ZonaZoo===\nOfficially implemented in 2003, ZonaZoo is the official student section and student ticketing program for the University of Arizona Athletics.

The official capacity has changed often. The largest crowd to see a game in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the [[University of New Mexico]], a main rival during that period. In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program's winningest coach. During a memorial service in 2001 for Lute's wife, Bobbi, who died after a battle with ovarian cancer, the floor was renamed Lute and Bobbi Olson Court. In addition to the playing surface, McKale Center is host to the offices of the UA athletic department. McKale Center is named after J.F. Pop McKale, who was athletic director and coach from 1914 through 1957. Joe Cavaleri (\"The Ooh-Aah Man\") made his dramatic and inspiring appearances there. [[Arizona Stadium]], built in 1928 and last expanded in 2013, seats 56,037 patrons. It hosts [[American football]] games and has also been used for university graduations. The turf is [[bermuda grass]], taken from the local Tucson National Golf Club. Arizona football's home record is 258\u2013139\u201312. The largest crowd ever in Arizona Stadium was 59,920 in 1996 for a game against Arizona State University. [[Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium]] hosts [[softball]] games.

Founded in 1885, the UofA was the first university in the [[Arizona Territory]]. {{as of|2018}}, the university enrolls 45,217 students<ref name=\"Facts\"/> in 19 separate colleges/schools, including the [[University of Arizona College of Medicine]] in Tucson and Phoenix and the [[James E. Rogers College of Law]], and is affiliated with two academic medical centers ([[Banner University Medical Center Tucson|Banner - University Medical Center Tucson]] and Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix). The University of Arizona is governed by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]]. The University of Arizona is one of the elected members of the [[Association of American Universities]] and is the only representative from the state of Arizona to this group.\n\nKnown as the [[Arizona Wildcats]] (often shortened to \"Cats\"), the UA's intercollegiate athletic teams are members of the [[Pac-12 Conference]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. UA athletes have won national titles in several sports, most notably men's basketball, baseball, and softball. The official colors of the university and its athletic teams are cardinal red and navy blue.\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=March 2014}}\n[[File:OldMain UofA 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Old Main in 1889]]\nAfter the passage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862]], the push for a university in Arizona grew. The Arizona Territory's \"[[Thieving Thirteenth]]\" Legislature approved the University of Arizona in 1885 and selected the city of Tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university. Tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but it was created as Arizona's [[normal school]], and not a university).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Flooding on the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] delayed Tucson's legislators, and by they time they reached [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made. Tucson was largely disappointed with receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize. With no parties willing to provide land for the new institution, the citizens of Tucson prepared to return the money to the Territorial Legislature until two gamblers and a saloon keeper decided to donate the land to build the school.<ref name=\"History 3a\">{{cite web | title=The Founding of the University: Myths and Heroes| access-date=Aug 11, 2019 | url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/the-founding-of-the-university-myths-and-heroes}}</ref> Construction of [[Old Main, University of Arizona|Old Main]], the first building on campus, began on October 27, 1887, and classes met for the first time in 1891 with 32 students in Old Main, which is still in use today.<ref name=\"History 3\">{{cite web | title=The Old Main | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | access-date=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060211105338/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 11, 2006}}</ref> Because there were no high schools in Arizona Territory, the university maintained separate preparatory classes for the first 23 years of operation.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Academics==\nThe University of Arizona offers bachelor's, master's, doctoral, and professional degrees.

The program's requirements entail that each honors student must complete 30 credit hours of honors credit by graduation time and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.5. To complete these credit hours, students may take courses designated as honors at the University of Arizona or may turn a regular course into an [[honors course]] through an honors contract. In addition, they must collaborate with a [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] member and write an honors thesis before graduating with honors from the University of Arizona.\n\nThe University of Arizona Honors College recently completed construction on an Honors dormitory known as the Honors Village. The facility includes a meal hall, which is open to the public, classroom spaces, faculty offices, and space for 1052 student residents.\n\nThere are additional resources available to honors students in the University of Arizona Honors College. Such resources include: longer library check-out dates, cheaper printing options at the Slonaker House, priority registration, additional honors advising, smaller class sizes taught by Honors faculty, clubs and organizations specifically available to only honors students such as the Honors Student Council and the Honors College Ambassadors, and additional scholarship opportunities.

The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north-south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below).\n\nThe science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library.\n[[File:University of Arizona mall.jpg|thumb|left|University of Arizona Mall]]\n\nSpeedway Boulevard, one of Tucson's primary east-west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed north of this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes. The university has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes for student housing in recent years. Sixth Street typically defines the southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out to students) south of this street.\n\nPark Avenue has traditionally defined the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main. Along or adjacent to all of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants such as [[Chipotle]], [[Panera Bread]] and [[Pei Wei Asian Diner|Pei Wei]]. The area near University Boulevard and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail activity going back to the university's early decades; many shops dating from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel was built in this immediate district in 1996. The Stevie Eller Dance Theater, opened in 2003 (across the Mall from [[McKale Center]]) as a {{convert|28600|sqft|m2|-1|adj=on}} dedicated performance venue for the UA's dance program, one of the most highly regarded university dance departments in the United States.

The Wildcat softball team plays at Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium.\n\n====Golf====\nThe university's golf teams have also been notably successful. The men's team won a national championship in 1992 ([[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships]]), and has produced a number of successful professionals, most notably [[Jim Furyk]]. The women's team won national championships in 1996, 2000 and 2018 ([[NCAA Women's Golf Championship]]). The women's golf program has produced professionals [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] and [[Lorena Ochoa]].\n\n====Men's lacrosse====\nThe [[lacrosse]] team is a club team, not a varsity sport at Arizona, known as the \"Laxcats\".

Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in [[ice hockey]]. The school's club hockey team, formerly known as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey|Icecats]], won over 800 games between its inception in 1979 and 2011. The Icecats defeated [[Penn State]] for the National Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985. They also appeared in eight Final Fours (\u201984, \u201986, \u201987, \u201988, \u201991, \u201993, \u201994, \u201997) and ten Elite Eights. {{as of|2011}}, they are part of [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]] Division I, and are known formally as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey]] team. Robert M. Tanita was a nationally ranked collegiate wrestler who reached the NCAA finals tournament as WAC champion in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arizonawildcathockey.org/history|title=History|website=Arizona Wildcat Hockey|language=en-us|access-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThree national championships for [[synchronized swimming]] were won in 1980, 1981, and 1984, though these championships were in the [[Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]], and not the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first [[NCAA]] Championship in men and women's swimming and diving for the seasons of 2007\u20132008. Topping off these weekends [[Frank Busch]], the men and women's head coach, was named [[NCAA]] Swimming Coach of the Year. Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA's win in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn's winning streak since 1998. At the end of the meet, the [[Texas Longhorns swimming and diving|Texas Longhorns]] took second while 2007's champion, the [[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn Tigers]], took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007's defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona's women did not let anyone come close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while the Auburn Tigers came in second with 348 and the [[Stanford Cardinal]] in third with 343. Student-athletes from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA. The [[NCAA Woman of the Year Award]] was won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/events/awards/1994-ncaa-woman-year|title=1994 NCAA Woman of the Year|last=jjackson|date=June 30, 2015|newspaper=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Individual national championships===\nA number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Arizona's first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium. Some other champion swimmers include [[Crissy Ahmann-Leighton]], [[Ryk Neethling]], [[Margo Geer]], [[Kevin Cordes]], and [[Amanda Beard]]. [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] won in 1991 in golf, and [[Brigetta Barrett]] won the women's high jump in 2013. The men's [[Cross country running|cross country]] has also produced two individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) ([[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship|NCAA Men's Cross Country Champions]]). The women's cross country also produced two individual national titles in 1996 (Amy Skieresz) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) ([[NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship]]). Another notable individual was football standout [[Vance Johnson]] who won the NCAA long jump in 1982.\n\n===Rivalries===\nA strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], Arizona. The University of Arizona leads the all-time record against Arizona State University in men's basketball (149\u201383), as well as in football (49\u201342\u20131). The football rivalry game between the schools is known as \"The Duel in the Desert.\" The trophy awarded after each game, the [[Territorial Cup]], is the nation's oldest rivalry trophy, distinguished by the NCAA. Rivalries have also been created with other [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] teams, especially [[University of California, Los Angeles]] which has provided a worthy [[softball]] rival and was Arizona's main basketball rival in the early and mid-1990s.\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Wilma & Wilber Wildcat in the bucket of Tucson Fire Department ladder truck 1.JPG|thumb|Wilma & Wilbur Wildcat at the 100th homecoming at the University of Arizona]]\nThe university's mascots are a pair of [[anthropomorphized]] [[Bobcat|wildcats]] named [[Wilbur and Wilma]].

From 1915 through the 1950s the school mascot was a live [[bobcat]], a species known locally as a wildcat. This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university from 1914 to 1921. 1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear. Ed Stuckenhoff was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition. Wilbur celebrated his 50th birthday in November 2009.\n\n===Fight song===\nIn 1952 Jack K. Lee, an applicant for the UA's band directorship, departed Tucson by air following an interview with UA administration. From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading \"BEAR DOWN.\" Inspired, Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song. By the time his plane landed, he had virtually finished it. A few weeks later Lee was named the UA band director, and in September 1952, the UA band performed \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" in public for the first time. Soon thereafter, \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" became accepted as UA's fight song ([[Bear Down]]).<ref name=\"Berger Memorial Fountain\">{{cite web | title=Berger Memorial Fountain | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060504055919/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===ZonaZoo===\nOfficially implemented in 2003, ZonaZoo is the official student section and student ticketing program for the University of Arizona Athletics. The ZonaZoo program is co-owned by the Associated Students of the University of Arizona (ASUA) and Arizona Athletics yet run by a team of individuals called the ZonaZoo Crew. In 2014, ESPN ranked ZonaZoo as the top student cheering section in the PAC 12 conference and in 2015, and in 2018, ZonaZoo received the Best Student Section of the Year award from the National Collegiate Student Section Association.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/article/2015/04/zonazoo-named-top-student-section-by-ncssa|title=ZonaZoo named top student section by NCSSA|last=Payne|first=Roberto|date=April 8, 2015|work=The Daily Wildcat|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Notable venues===\nThe [[McKale Center]], which opened in 1973, is used by men's and women's basketball, women's gymnastics, and women's volleyball. The official capacity has changed often. The largest crowd to see a game in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the [[University of New Mexico]], a main rival during that period. In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program's winningest coach. During a memorial service in 2001 for Lute's wife, Bobbi, who died after a battle with ovarian cancer, the floor was renamed Lute and Bobbi Olson Court. In addition to the playing surface, McKale Center is host to the offices of the UA athletic department. McKale Center is named after J.F.

It was inspired by the [[off-Broadway]] stage [[Starstruck (play)|play]] with the same name written by [[Elaine Lee]], with contributions from [[Susan Norfleet Lee]] and [[Dale Place]].\n\nThe ''Starstruck'' creator-owned illustrated [[science fiction]] serial has been produced at various intervals since 1982 by writer Lee and artist [[Michael Wm. Kaluta]]; their primary collaborators are colorist [[Lee Moyer]] and letterer [[Todd Klein]]. The series, epic in scope, has been carried across multiple comic companies, but primarily by [[Epic Comics]], [[Dark Horse Comics]], and [[IDW Publishing]]. It was collected in a revised and recolored hardcover book form as ''Starstruck Deluxe Edition'' in 2011.\n\n''starstruckthoughts'' is website in an anarchic  future in which Humanity spans the universe. The Great Dictator has fallen and a power vacuum sparks a chess game of eccentric players scheming for control. The seriocomic stories follow Captain Galatia 9 and her running partner, Brucilla The Muscle, as they navigate madcap scenarios and surreal misadventures in between the galactic infighting.\n\nSince its inception, ''Starstruck'' has built a cult audience and critical acclaim from peers, periodicals, and fans for the sophistication of its storytelling. Most noted is the predominantly female cast, portrayed by Lee with a range and nuance that confounds gender stereotypes. Kaluta, an esteemed veteran of comics and illustration, is often commended for the virtuosity and imaginative detail of his artwork. Also, the series is cited for the progressiveness of its rich and complex structure: ''Starstruck'' preceded ''[[Watchmen]]'' in using innovations like nonlinear storytelling, overlapping dialogue, multiple story threads, back-up text, unreliable narrators, adjunct stories, underlying themes, recurring symbols, and an almost symphonic interconnectedness.\n\n==Play==\n{{Main|Starstruck (play)}}\n\n[[Elaine Lee]] herself played the adventurous lead, Captain Galatia 9, while Susan Norfleet Lee played her rowdy pilot, Brucilla the Muscle. Noted [[illustrator]] [[Michael Wm. Kaluta]] played a major role in visual aspects of the play, working on sets, costumes and promotional material.<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\">Susan Adamo. ''\"Starstruck: Artist Mike Kaluta's Designs For This SF-Comedy Satire\"''. Starlog Magazine #41, (December 1980) P.24.</ref> The story is set in the future, and features several strong female lead characters.  A strange and gleefully corrupt future version of the [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Guides]], the ''Galactic Girl Guides'', are introduced in a subplot that leads to the climax. The ''Starstruck'' play was produced in 1980, with another staging in 1983.<ref>Elaine Lee, Susan Norfleet, and Dale Place (March 1985). ''Starstruck (A Space Opera)''. Broadway Play Publishing, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-88145-023-1}}</ref>\n\nThe script of the play ({{ISBN|978-0-88145-023-1}}) was published in 1985 and is still available.\n\nAn audioplay adaption was recorded in 2010, and released on CD and download.\n\n===Background and creation===\nElaine Lee was an actor in the late 1970s New York City theatre and television scene. She was nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for her work on the long-running NBC soap opera, [[The Doctors (soap opera)|The Doctors]];<ref>\"[https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000206/1980 Daytime Emmy Awards winners and nominations, 1980]\"</ref> she portrayed the troubled character Mildred Trumble, modeled after [[Sissy Spacek]]'s character, Pinky Rose, in [[Robert Altman]]'s film ''[[3 Women]]''. Seeing a lack of range and depth in the roles being offered to female actors,<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\">Alex Dueben. \"[http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Elaine+Lee:+Starstruck/  Elaine Lee: Starstruck]\", Suicide Girls, April 5, 2011.</ref> she formed a Manhattan theatre company with her sister, Susan Norfleet Lee, and actor friends which they called Wild Hair Productions. The Lees wrote their own plays for the company to star in, starting with \"Brief Cases\".\n\nDuring the writing of a second play, ''The Contamination of the Kokomo Lounge'', Elaine began pulling together ideas for a science fiction play. The Lee sisters were at a Manhattan bar/cafe called The Library, discussing ideas over a pile of science fiction magazines when illustrator [[Michael Wm. Kaluta]], a neighbor who often sketched there, approached them asking, \"Are you science fiction fans?\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\"/> Elaine kept his card for the future.<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\"/> Elaine Lee was subsequently impressed by seeing Kaluta's art in the West Side Comics store, on a poster showcasing [[The Studio (commune)|The Studio]], an art collective he shared with [[Barry Windsor Smith]], [[Jeffrey Catherine Jones|Jeffrey Jones]], and [[Berni Wrightson]].<ref name=\"newsarama1\">Zack Smith. \"[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/060917-STarstruck01.html The Starstruck Chronicles, I: Bringing Starstruck Back.]\" Newsarama, June 17, 2009.</ref> Kaluta was impressed by the wit and range of their second play: he recalled thinking, \"If they're going to do a science fiction play, they're going to do it very well.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\"/>\n\nElaine Lee's first draft was on a stack of 5x7 index cards. Lee wrote all the drafts of the script, with some dialogue suggestions from Susan Norfleet and Dale Place.<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\"/> The quality of the material persuaded Kaluta to create the show poster. He became the costume designer after asking what costumes the actors would wear in the poster, and the set designer when the regular one got sick.<ref name=\"autogenerated1984\">Peter Sanderson. ''\"Amazons, Anarchy, And Androids\"''. Amazing Heroes #57, (October 15, 1984) P.26.</ref> Kaluta told an interviewer backstage about the evolution of his role: \"Should it be like a real 1930s movie poster? That's when I realized I wanted to do characterizations of the entire cast on the poster. But, I had to know what they looked like. So that's when I started designing the costumes. Because I designed them so intricately, I had to build them. And that's when my house started looking like the [[Garment District, Manhattan|garment district]].\"<ref name=\"Steve Ringgenberg 1981 P.93\">Steve Ringgenberg. \"''An Interview With Mike Kaluta''\", The Comic Times Media Showcase #5, (March 1981) P.93.</ref>\n\n''Starstruck'' was being created in the late 1970s period of New York City's decline, when poor musicians in [[DIY ethic|Punk]] and free jazz were making a rising scene out of cheap rents, collective venues, and street throwaways.<ref>Tym Stevens, \"Starstruck: A History...\",'' Starstruck Deluxe Edition'', 2011.  {{ISBN|978-1-60010-872-3}}</ref> \"You could build an entire city on the stuff the city throws away, just sitting out there,\" Kaluta said.<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\"/> The resulting sets, designed in the style of classic science fiction serials, used Hot Wheels tracks, walkie talkies, medical splints, medicine jars full of marbles, Bingo chips, coffee lids, and plastic cups, which Kaluta glue-gunned together with help from his colleague, Fantasy illustrator [[Charles Vess]].\n\nThe ''Starstruck'' play received its first national coverage in an article in ''[[Starlog]]'' magazine #41 in December 1980, which included an interview of Lee and Kaluta, along with Kaluta's design sketches, and stage photos by Sean Smith.<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\"/>\n\n==Comics==\nThe characters and stories of ''Starstruck'' have continued in [[comics]] form across multiple comic companies, but primarily Heavy Metal, Epic, Dark Horse, and IDW.\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=40%|quote=Going from stage to comics, we were able to expand the universe, introduce more characters and scatter them across multiple planets, settings that would be impossible to build.

People can float in a gravity-free atmosphere, without the use of rigs and wires. You can have extreme long shots and close-ups, scenes of one army attacking another. Violence is easier to convey. We could stretch the story to cover longer periods of time. And we could go inside the mind of a character.<ref name=\"comicbookresources1\">Tim O'Shea. \"[http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2009/08/talking-comics-with-tim-elaine-lee/ Talking comics With Elaine Lee]\", ''Robot'' 6, August 31, 2009.</ref>|source=-- Elaine Lee on the genesis of ''Starstruck'' comics.}}\n\n===Background and creation===\nThe ''Starstruck'' play had been optioned by a producer in 1980, which bound Lee from developing any further stage versions for a year.  Kaluta saw a solution but with some reluctance: \"Though I did suggest Elaine do a comic book version of the play when all the rest of the rights were tied up by the then producer, I didn't want to draw the comic book.\"<ref name=\"newsarama2\">Zack Smith. \"[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/060918-Starstruck2.html The Starstruck Chronicles II: Helping Gene Colan]\", Newsarama, June 18, 2009.</ref> Kaluta had initially made his fame as illustrator of [[The Shadow]] comics for [[DC Comics]] in the early 1970s, and was now hesitant to take such a big project on. They also assessed that a dialogue-heavy script on two simple sets would not translate well to the big action and quick captions of comics. \"But the material, and, especially Elaine's witty approach to everything she writes set a small fire under me.\"<ref name=\"newsarama2\"/>\n\nThey found the solution in the backdrop. The stage play had moments where the narrator sketched the backgrounds of each character. Lee and Kaluta had worked out an elaborate backstory of the future time period, the political landscape, the pasts and futures of the characters, and many new characters not seen in the play. This scope of myth-building, inspired by the spirit of ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' and ''[[Star Trek]]'', had been beyond their resources to stage or film.<ref name=\"autogenerated1984\"/> Adapting that dynamic epic to comics proved a better solution than simply adapting the play.\n\nBy 1980, [[Creator ownership|creator-owned]] comics published by [[Alternative comics|independent comics]] publishers were now being sold in an emerging network of [[Direct market|comics stores]]. Lee and Kaluta took this opportunity to expand their storytelling while retaining sole ownership and control of their creative property. Lee would script and Kaluta would illustrate prequel stories that expanded the backdrop and character relationships in a lead-up to the events of the stage play. Since DC and [[Marvel Comics]] were dominated by superheroes, the first market they looked at was the mature comic magazines of Europe.\n\nTheir initial model was [[Heavy Metal (magazine)|''Heavy Metal'']] magazine, which channeled the adult fantasy serials of France's ''[[M\u00e9tal Hurlant]]''. Lee told an interviewer, \"The stuff in ''Heavy Metal'' completely blew me away and I wanted to do a play that was something like the stories they published.\"<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\"/> One year earlier, the original path for ''Starstruck'' had been paved when a fight scene between two women that Elaine had written reminded actor Dale Place of the style of Heavy Metal: \"Oh, that would be fun, to do a kind of science fiction play\" for her company, the writer recounted.<ref name=\"autogenerated1984\"/> Kaluta was a fan of the contributing artist [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]], particularly his kinetic line and non-linear, surprising stories.<ref name=\"autogenerated1985\">Phil Trumbo. \"Lurking In the Hearts Of Men\". ''The Comics Journal'' #103, (November 1985) p. 50.</ref> The ''Starstruck'' prequel series they first produced were firmly in the template of these magazines; hallucinogenic narratives, elaborate fine art, epic backdrops, farcical humor, and adult themes, printed in serialized segments across many issues.\n\n''Starstruck'''s move from New York stage play to comic series anticipated a similar path for ''[[Warp!]]''.<ref name=gcd>{{gcdb series|id=2814|title=''Warp'' (1983 series)}}</ref> This 1971 sci-fi play had played a limited run on Broadway, with Art Direction by comics innovator (and Kaluta's friend/mentor) [[Neal Adams]]. It eventually became a comic series from [[First Comics]] in 1983, after ''Starstruck''. Another contemporary parallel is ''[[A Distant Soil]]'',<ref>{{comicbookdb|type=title|id=6524|title=''A Distant Soil'' (WaRP Graphics)}}</ref> a challenging sci-fi/fantasy series by writer/artist [[Colleen Doran]] which had print runs and revised expansions across multiple alternative comic companies, also starting in 1983.\n\nThe first serials of ''Starstruck'' comics were printed in Spain's'' Ilustracion+Comix Internacional'', and then America's ''Heavy Metal'', in 1982.\n\n==Story==\nCenturies in the future, Earth's population has been halved by a nuclear war. Humanity has emigrated out into the universe, colonizing worlds and interacting with aliens. Various regimes have held power, most recently The Great Dictator. After his overthrow by revolutionaries, a power struggle rages on between his heirs, the Bajars, and the revolutionary leaders, the Medeas. Mary Medea fakes her death and begins an elaborate plan to eventually take control and stabilize the anarchic era. Disguised as a new player, Queen Glorianna, she orchestrates a web of interconnections to achieve what will one day be called The Great Change. The story follows the various pawns and rivals in the game, in evolving stages of their lives and of the scheme, as they all eventually meet and collide. In particular the story focuses on the backstories of Galatia 9, a freedom-fighter amazon, and Brucilla The Muscle, a good-natured hothead pilot; where they came from, how they meet, and what happens because of it.\n\nKaluta explained, \"As the books progress, the reader gets a slow reveal of the greater energies and alliances by the way they impact the lives of the happy-go-lucky space girls and boys eking out their bits of the big ball of wax.\"<ref name=\"newsarama1\"/>\n\n==Characters==\nLee and Kaluta frequently told interviewers they wanted to step away from good-vs.-evil characters to tell stories of flawed people who were too slippery for such boundaries. The writer said, \"In our comic book the 'good guys' are not all good, and the 'bad guys' are not totally bad, and the characters do really stupid things. These characters all have faults. [But they] get smarter, just as people learn things in life.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Peter Sanderson. ''\"Amazons, Anarchy, And Androids\"''. Amazing Heroes #57, (October 15, 1984) P.32.</ref> The artist said, \"There is no ruler of the universe making other people dance. But there's lots of people in the comic who think they're making other people dance. And that's where the fun is, to watch the characters delude themselves.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1985\"/>\n\nThe cast of the comics are based on the likenesses of the original stage ensemble. Lee explains that when they started the first serials, \"Michael drew the characters in ''Starstruck'' to look like the actors in the original production.\"<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\"/> This included the troupe of Wild Hair Productions as well as extended friends. The writer said, \"If you had walked into one of our parties, you would think you had walked into a party on Rec Station 97!\"<ref name=\"newsarama2\"/>\n\n'''Queen Glorianna / Mary Medea''': The Medea family were revolutionaries who overthrew The Great Dictator, P.A.H.M. Bajar. The ongoing feud between the families motivates Mary Medea to go underground in plain sight as the mystical Queen Glorianna. Her ownership of the lucrative Krystal asteroid mines empowers her complex, secretive plan to manipulate a better, progressive future.\n\n'''Galatia 9''': Molly Medea was ostracized from the family in her youth and ended up initiated with the Omegazons, an amazon colony. By wily means she ended up captaining her own fighter ship, The Harpy, and brought in Brucilla as her partner.\n\n'''Brucilla The Muscle''': A Galactic Girl Guide from Kansas who became a star pilot in the [[jingoistic]] Space Brigade. When a double-cross frames her into a dishonorable discharge from service, Brucilla brings her skills and temper to the service of Galatia 9.\n\n'''Erotica Ann''': The last of a line of pleasure droids, Annie achieves awareness and slowly evolves a consciousness. As an initial instrument of Glorianna's plan, she threads the lives of the Bajars with the Harpy crew.\n\n'''Verloona T\u00ef''': The wicked stepsister of Galatia 9, a vain and power-hungry vamp with unspeakable appetites.\n\n'''Kalif Bajar''': The idiot great-grandson of The Great Dictator, Kalif is unhealthily attached to a destroyed Erotica Ann model. He eventually colludes with Verloona.\n\n'''Lucrezia Bajar / Ronnie Lee Ellis''': The smart twin sister of Kalif Bajar, Lucrezia chafes at being passed over for power because of her gender. As the spectacularly successful author Ronnie Lee Ellis, she orchestrates her own counter-scheme to Glorianna, controlling the vapid nuns of the Cloistered Order of the Cosmic Veil.\n\n'''Rah El Rex''': A schizophrenic dandy who thinks he is being controlled by a being called The Great Disrupter, Rex eventually allies with Verloona.\n\n'''Harry Palmer''': Seen first as a bartender, Harry was actually a soldier with Mary Medea, and transfers his love for her to Erotica Ann, her double.\n\n'''Randall Factor''': A casino owner on the infamous intergalactic watering hole Recreation Station 97, Randall is 'the random factor' whose ties to Glorianna and Harry might not guarantee where his interests lie.\n\n'''Galactic Girl Guides''': Young girls have to grow up tough in an anarchic galaxy; a corps of shamelessly shifty and street-smart ''Galactic Girl Guides'' permeates the cosmos, made up of little girls with fast hands and nimble plans.\n\n==Publication history==\n''Starstruck'' has essentially been the original 80 pages, printed in serial form and a graphic novel; and then six new issues of [[Epic Comics]]. This material was expanded by 100 pages for [[Dark Horse Comics]] (up to and including Epic #1); this same material was later refined and recolored for [[IDW Publishing]].\n\nThis is known as Volume 1, and was collected in the ''Starstruck Deluxe Edition''. Two or three more volumes are planned, with 220 pages of unpublished new story material expanding the remaining five Epic issues.\n\n===Comix Internacional, 1982===\nThe first ''Starstruck'' stories were printed in Spain starting in April 1982, in the anthology magazine ''[[Comix Internacional|Ilustracion+Comix Internacional]]'' #17.<ref>Tym Stevens, \"Starstruck: A History...\", ''Starstruck Deluxe Edition'', 2011.  {{ISBN|978-1-60010-872-3}}</ref> The magazine was an equivalent to ''[[Metal Hurlant]]'' and [[Heavy Metal (magazine)|''Heavy Metal'']], printing countercultural science fiction and fantasy comics with adult themes and sexuality.  Editor [[Selecciones Ilustradas|Josep Toutain]] was an artist and artists agent representing the wave of Spanish talent who had rejuvenated [[Warren Publishing]] titles like ''[[Vampirella]]'' and ''[[Creepy (magazine)|Creepy]]'' in the mid-1970s; he ran the European branch of Warren, then took it over, and expanded into other imprints and graphic novels.<ref>Jon B. Cooke, David A. Roach. ''The Warren Companion'', Appendix i, p.265, TwoMorrows Publishing, 2001.</ref> Toutain also reprinted innovative strips by American artists like [[Will Eisner]], [[Richard Corben]], and [[Howard Chaykin]], and it was in his variation of Warren's Comix International that ''Starstruck'' made its debut.\n\nThe color was provided by an uncredited Spanish coloring house, who added rich watercolor-esque hues working from the color cues provided by Kaluta.\n\nThe stories ran as serialized vignettes across seven issues: from April to November 1982, skipping the September issue and doubling the length in the October issue.<ref>\"Ilustracion+Comix Internacional\" #17-21, 23; Spain, 1982.</ref>\n\n''Starstruck'' was on the front cover of ''Ilustracion+Comix Internacional ''#17 (April 1982), featuring Kaluta's watercolor art of the warrior/poet droid, Veep 7, and the large headline \"Estrenamos Aqui un Espectaculo de Broadway Llevado al Comic por Mike W. Kaluta y Elaine Lee: Starstruck\".\n\n''Starstruck'' was also on the front cover of ''Ilustracion+Comix Internacional'' #23, using a portrait piece of Erotica Ann from the limited edition ''Starstruck'' portfolio, printed in color for the first time. The headline read: \"La Increible Fantasia de Mike Kaluta\".\n\n===Heavy Metal, 1982===\nThe ''Starstruck'' stories were then picked up for their first American printing by [[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]], edited by Julie Simmons-Lynch. They were run as chapters averaging about seven to eight pages each across nine issues from November 1982, to July 1983.<ref>Heavy Metal #8211-8307/a.k.a., Vol. 6, #8-12-Vol. 7, 1-4; HM Communications, 1982.</ref><ref>\"[http://www.heavymetalmagazinefanpage.com/hmlist83.html Heavy Metal checklist]\"</ref>\n\nThe magazine traded often on Kaluta's fame in comic art circles, running bylines for him on the front and back covers to promote interest. ''Starstruck'' was front-loaded as the first story in the initial issues.\n\nThe Art Director at the time was [[John Workman]], who would also letter much of the later Epic Comics run, as well as the eventual ''Galactic Girl Guides'' back-up stories.\n\nThe English lettering was done by [[Todd Klein]], who was then beginning his career.<ref name=\"kleinletters8626\">Todd Klein, \"[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/?p=8626 And Then I Read: Starstruck 3-7]\", April 15, 2010.</ref>\n\nIn the seventh issue, May 1983, a five-page article was included called \"Stagestruck ''Starstruck''\" by contributing Editor Stephen Maloff, with an overview of the play's two productions and its transition to mature comics. The Lee and Kaluta interviews were supplemented with art examples and color photos of the stage play shot by Sean Smith.<ref>Stephen Moloff. ''\"Stagestruck Starstruck\"''. Heavy Metal, #8311, (November 1983) P.45.</ref>\n\n===Marvel Graphic Novel, 1984===\nThe entirety of the ''Comix Internacional/Heavy Metal'' stories were published together in their first collected form in ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]] ''#13 in September 1984, titled ''Starstruck: The Luckless, the Abandoned and Forsaked''.<!-- NOT \"THE\" FORSAKED ... the title is a Quote from Bob Dylan's 'Chimes of Freedom'--> {{ISBN|978-0-87135-001-5}}\n\nThis retained the Spanish color, with a few tweaks and additions in the stories. When Marvel editorial expressed concern at the violence in a scene where space amazons defeat beastly hillbillies, Elaine Lee added a war song that repeated the refrain, \"The Dromes were bad (x6), so we had to kill them.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1984\"/><ref>Commander Rick. \"Prisoners of Gravity: Censorship\", Canadian television interview program, October 25, 1990.</ref>\n\nMarvel Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter recommended cutting three pages, and adding three new pages. The sequence with young Bronwyn falling into the tank of empathic merpeople was cut from the Graphic Novel, but restored and expanded in the later Dark Horse series.\n\nThe subtitle was a lyric quote from [[Bob Dylan]]'s 1964 song \"[[Chimes of Freedom (song)|Chimes of Freedom]]\".\n\nThe graphic novel, dedicated to director [[Robert Altman]] and author [[Thomas Pynchon]], included a four-page glossary in the back that expanded upon references in the story, much in the spirit of the concurrent work of [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. This became an ongoing tradition in the future issues.\n\n''Starstruck: The Luckless, the Abandoned and Forsaked'' was nominated for a [[Kirby Award|Jack Kirby Award]] as The Best Graphic Album of 1985.<ref name=\"hahnlibrary1985\">\"[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kirby85.php Jack Kirby Award nomination, 1985]\"</ref>\n\n===Epic Comics, 1985===\nMarvel's imprint, [[Epic Comics]], was created as an outlet for creator-owned, mature, experimental comics series. Editor [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] spun the acclaim and success of the ''Starstruck'' graphic novel into an ongoing series by Lee and Kaluta. These were the first story expansions past the initial run of serial stories printed in ''Ilustracion+Comix International'','' Heavy Metal'', and the ''Marvel Graphic Novel''.\n\nAn in-house Marvel promotional magazine, ''[[Marvel Age]]'', issue #15 (June 1984), did a cover story on Archie Goodwin and his editing of the new Epic comics titles and ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' magazine. A cover cartoon of Epic characters by [[Rick Parker (artist)|Rick Parker]] included Brucilla the Muscle as well as her Tiger Brigade shark ship; oddly, no mention was made of the impending ''Starstruck'' graphic novel released two months later, or the new Epic book series seven months away.<ref>Mark Lerer. ''Marvel Age'' #15, June 1984.</ref>\n\nThe new series ran for six bi-monthly issues cover-dated from February 1985, to February 1986. Archie Goodwin took a hands-off approach to editing, saying \"I could edit this, but I would ruin it.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Starstruck #13, IDW Publishing, September 2010.</ref>\n\nThe first two issues were colored by Elaine Lee, and then followed by [[Steve Oliff]]. The first two were lettered by [[Ken Bruzenak]], and then followed by the creators' former [[Heavy Metal (magazine)|''Heavy Metal'']] colleague [[John Workman]].\n\nThe story arc introduced Harry Palmer, a character inspired by noir detective fiction who opened the doors on much of Queen Glorianna's past and her future plans. Lee cites this as her favorite character, and the only love story she ever wrote.\n\nA trio of ''Galactic Girl Guides'' became a running thread through the issues. One of the Guides would become a crucial historian in the future, the person credited for all the barbed and humorous Glossary entries.\n\nThe Epic issues ran ads for purchasing the two ''Starstruck'' T-shirts, the art portfolio, and the stage play script.\n\n''[[Amazing Heroes]]'' #57 ran an article by comic historian and writer [[Peter Sanderson]] about the new Epic series, featuring Brucilla the Muscle on the cover, on October 15, 1984. It extensively covered the origins and outgrowth of ''Starstruck'' from the two stage productions into the serial comics stories, and was the first article to extend coverage to the new bi-monthly comic book. Lee and Kaluta were interviewed, with comic and portfolio art, and stage photos.<ref name=\"autogenerated1984\"/>\n\n''[[Comics Journal]]'' #103 did a cover story and career overview interview with Michael Kaluta in November 1985. The cover featured ''Starstruck'''s Erotica Ann disrobing from [[The Shadow]]'s cloak while saying, \"Is this really what it takes to get your attention?\" Kaluta spoke at length about the genesis and development of the ''Starstruck'' play and comics.<ref name=\"autogenerated1985\"/> ''Comics Journal'' #111 featured an extensive review of ''Starstruck'' in September 1986, praising it for its intelligence and progressive approach to gender and sexual identity issues.<ref>Robert Rodi. \"Sexually Suspect: Rob Rodi on [[P. Craig Russell|Night Music]] and Starstruck\". ''The Comics Journal'' #111, (September 1986) P.48-54.</ref>\n\n''[[Marvel Age]]'' #26 did a cover story in July 1985; the Marvel promotional magazine featured a Kaluta cover of Brucilla the Muscle with Malcolm Trueheart thrown over her shoulder, a gender-flipping spoof of a popular [[Dave Stevens]] drawing of the [[Rocketeer]] with Betty thrown over his shoulder.<ref>Marvel Age #26, July 1985.</ref> In the oval frame surrounding the figures, sign language hands using finger spelling cues signal the phrase, \"Thanks Dave, Cliff, and Betty!\"\n\nThe cover for the Colorado Comic Art Con V program book (1985) featured ''Starstruck'' characters Galatia 9 and Brucilla the Muscle, with art by Kaluta.\n\n===Comico Comics, 1987===\nWhen the Epic Comics series ended, Lee and Kaluta tried a different approach. They created two stories about the ''Galactic Girl Guides'', published as back-up strips in [[Dave Stevens]]'s ''[[The Rocketeer]] Adventure Magazine'' from [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico Comics]] in 1987 and '88. These stories focused on the youthful misadventures of Brucilla the Muscle and her two friends as they became Guides, and were done in a lighter slapstick tone in the tradition of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] and [[Our Gang]]. Fantasy illustrator [[Charles Vess]], a long-time colleague of Kaluta's who had helped him create costumes and props for the play, was the inker.\n\nLee and Kaluta intended this kid-friendly approach, without the trappings of the epic backstory, as an easier portal to the ''Starstruck'' universe for new readers. More stories were planned until a long lag in continuing the [[Rocketeer]]'s adventures put the idea on hold, but the ''Guides'' series would be returned to in the coming years.\n\n===Dark Horse Comics, 1990===\nWhen Dark Horse Comics contacted Kaluta for a job, he thought they were approaching him for continuing ''Starstruck''. Editor Randy Spradley was delighted by the idea, and the first ''Starstruck'' revival began.<ref name=\"newsarama1\"/> Dark Horse had noted that Epic Comics series which, like ''Starstruck'', had not sold well in the limited release of comic stores were finding their audiences as collected trade collections, such as ''[[Moonshadow (comics)|Moonshadow]]'' and ''[[Elektra: Assassin]]''. They felt the time was now fortuitous to do a new graphic novel collection.<ref name=\"autogenerated1990\">Mark Askwith, ''Starstruck: The Expanding Universe'' #1, August 1990.</ref>\n\nLee and Kaluta unveiled ''Starstruck: The Expanding Universe''. Instead of starting with new stories or just collecting the finished ones into a trade paperback, the two creators decided to essentially start over: the initial series would actually be the original graphic novel and Epic issues, but with huge expansions of new story and art inside of them, to be followed by all-new material encompassing the remaining stories they had not done yet. They envisioned three printing arcs, each a volume in the total history of ''Starstruck''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1990\"/>\n\nThe first four issues were published as \"Volume 1\" from August 1990, to March 1991, with over 100 pages of new material that substantially redefined and expanded everything printed before. \"Volume 1\" included the Graphic Novel, the expanded material, and ended after the first Epic Comics issue.\n\nIn the editorial page of the premiere issue, the publishing plan was outlined: there would be twelve total issues, divided as three volumes; each volume would be four issues each, separated with short publishing breaks between, and would include a total of 320 pages of new material,<ref name=\"autogenerated1990\"/> \"Volume 2\" would have continued into the Epic issues, expanding greatly on the Harry Palmer storyline. It was left undefined in the press release whether the third volume would also consist of the remaining Epic issues with new material, or instead be all-new material following those stories, such as an adaption of the stage play itself, or a dramatization of the \"Great Change\" event that the series' Glossary often refers to as the ultimate fruition of the narrative.\n\nThe four issues were printed this time in black-and-white. This was the first time that the initial 80 pages of Graphic Novel material had been printed in the smaller comic book size. Because that art had originally been formatted for a magazine medium with squarer dimensions, these pages now had about 20% white space at the bottom of the more rectangular comics format pages. This evened out in the latter part of the fourth issue, with the reprinting of the first Epic Comics issue, which was originally done in the regular comic size dimensions.\n\nTodd Klein returned, supplementing his original lettering of the Graphic Novel era stories by completely relettering the reprint of Epic issue #1, which had first been lettered by Ken Bruzenak.\n\nThe second issue began the introductory story summaries by fan [[Lee Moyer]], who would later renovate the series with his lavish color for the IDW remastered revival.<ref>Lee Moyer, ''Starstruck: The Expanding Universe'' #2, October 1990.</ref>\n\nThe Dark Horse issues ran ads for purchasing the two ''Starstruck'' T-shirts, the portfolio, and the stage play script. Dark Horse also used a ''Starstruck'' character on the cover of their anthology series, \"[[Cheval Noir (comics)|Cheval Noir]]\" #18 (May, 1991);<ref>[http://www.comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=82143 Cheval Noir at Comic Book Database]</ref> a painting by Kaluta of the fighter droid Veep 7.\n\nKaluta did the cover and some amount of new interior art for the unpublished fifth issue which would begin Volume 2, but -while simultaneously doing production design for various TV shows- a state of exhaustion wore him down.<ref>[http://www.kaluta.com/pages/bio/bio.html Kaluta career timeline, 1991.]</ref> Dark Horse printed no further issues after the fourth, leaving the series revival in hiatus.\n\n===Tundra Comics, 1990s===\nThrough the 1990s, attempts were made to continue ''Starstruck'' in some comics form.\n\nIn interviews, Michael Kaluta has detailed a successive attempt to do new ''Galactic Girl Guides'' stories. Five issues intended for [[Tundra Publishing]] were plotted by him along with writer Phil Trumbo, and illustrated by [[Linda Medley]] with lettering by Todd Klein.<ref name=\"kleinletters8626\"/> Lee recalls, \"Michael and I were supposed to have done the ''Galactic Girl Guides'' for [[Kevin Eastman]]'s company, Tundra Comics. But when Tundra was bought by Kitchen Sink, the project was cancelled.\"<ref name=\"comicbookresources1\"/>\n\nKaluta's website mentions that in 1996 he was \"(s)till drawing ''Starstruck, the Expanding Universe'' for Dark Horse Comics. The first collection is to be published by Marlowe & Co. in the fall of 1996. Marlowe chokes and refuses to publish. Project dead.\"<ref>[http://www.kaluta.com/pages/bio/bio.html Kaluta career timeline, 1996]</ref> This implied that there was a chance at a graphic novel collection of the Volume 1 expanded stories, while Kaluta was also working further on completing expanded story art for Volume 2.\n\nIn 1995, Kaluta also contributed art to a story in Elaine Lee's erotic graphic novel, \"''Skin Tight Orbit'', Volume 1\", which is considered to be somewhere within the ''Starstruck'' universe; \"The Next Best Thing...\" was initially published in [[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]].<ref>Heavy Metal, Vol.17, No.1, March 1993.</ref> Also, three stories drawn by [[Mary Wilshire]] star a character who looks like Galatia 9, with references to ''Starstruck'' such as the Handi Andy pleasure droid.<ref>Elaine Lee. \"''Skin Tight Orbit'', volume 1\", NBM/Amerotica, 1995.</ref>\n\n===IDW Revival, 2009===\nIn May 2009, [[IDW Publishing]] announced that the ''Starstruck'' comic book series would be published again.<ref name=\"newsarama1\"/> These 13 monthly issues were a remastering of the Dark Horse ''\"Expanded Universe\"'' series: the original graphic novel, the 100 pages of added material, and the first Epic Comics issue. Kaluta now expanded the bulk of the art pages from the square format to the full rectangular format with new art. Painter [[Lee Moyer]] did a lush and complex revamping of all the color using contemporary digital technology. Besides the revised version of \"Volume 1\", the two ''Galactic Girl Guides'' stories first printed by Comico would now be reprinted along with several other unpublished GGG stories from that era, inked by Charles Vess and lettered by John Workman.\n\nAdditionally, there were new pin-ups, and revised entries in the Glossary. Fan artists were given a spotlight in a few issues: CG diagrams of the ship, The Harpy, were provided by Walt Carter;<ref>Starstruck #11, IDW Publishing, July 2010.</ref> and Kristina Carroll did a painting of art assassin Kettle Black in a scene alluded to in text but never previously shown before.<ref>Starstruck #10, IDW Publishing, June 2010.</ref> A new color fumetti-story concluded the final issue, using some of Sean Smith's play photos, which included Elaine Lee as Galatia 9 and Susan Norfleet Lee as Brucilla the Muscle.\n\nThe first issue was released on August 12, 2009 and the series was completed in September 2010. The final afterword stated, \"This is not the end!

Additionally the art was newly increased by 20% on each page by Kaluta in 2009, and new color was painted by Lee Moyer.

''The Comics Journal'' #111, (September 1986) pp. 52-53.</ref>|source= Critic [[Robert Rodi]] for the ''[[Comics Journal]]'', 1986.}}\n\n''Starstruck'' is lauded critically as a landmark advance in comics storytelling methods, recognized in retrospect for using innovations years ahead of ''[[Watchmen]]'', which is commonly praised for them. Like its parallel descendants ''[[Watchmen]]'' and ''[[From Hell]]'', the series is a large mosaic of seemingly random but steadily interlocking people and events.\n\nThe series started in 1982 by eschewing the then standard superhero formula of one male character in self-contained stories, instead using an ensemble of mainly female characters in multiple intwined story threads. The original first 73 pages of serial stories covered a span of nearly three decades, on different planets, with a wide and seemingly unconnected cast, which ultimately led to everyone coming to one space station at the same time. \"There is no reason why a story written for a comic shouldn't be every bit as involving as the plot of a novel,\" Lee wrote in 1997. \"It's a wonderful form, and it can be stretched as far as creators and publishers are willing to go with it.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1997\">Elaine Lee. ''BrainBanx'' #5, Helix Comics, July 1997.</ref> In one sense, the series was [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear]] by the sheer span of its subjects, the episodic glimpses of them in different times and places, their flashback sequences, the element of perceived randomness altering their paths, and the uncertainty of their connectedness: an uncommon narrative strategy that now draws comparisons to critically successful TV shows like [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']]. In another sense, the series is a very particularly linear story -going so far as to detail the births and maturing of pivotal characters- which is too large to be seen all at once: a novelistic narrative now seen similarly in critically praised TV shows like ''[[The Wire]]''. The writer said in 2009, \"When we were first published, people were used to comics with linear stories about a main character. But now, with an audience used to shows like [[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|''Heroes'']] and  ''Lost'', with large casts and non-linear storylines, we're hoping that ''Starstruck'' will find an even larger readership.\"<ref name=\"newsarama2\"/>\n\n''Starstruck'' used supplement texts as a dramatic expansion of the story. The Glossary, written by one fictional historian, went past defining references in the dialogue to sketching out the past, present, and future of the characters and their universe. Writer [[Alan Moore]] would do something similar afterward, more simply in ''[[Watchmen]] ''(1985) and much more extensively in his ''[[League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen]] ''(1999). ''Starstruck'' can be considered one of comics' premiere [[hypertext fiction]]s, in the sense of using supplementary texts, adjunct stories, and ancillary art to expand, deepen, and even alter the narrative experience. [[Comics Journal]] praised this innovation in 1986: \"The (Space) Brigade's origin in the Graphic Novel's glossary section, is hilarious; in general, the ''Starstruck'' glossaries provide as much mirth as the series itself.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated1986\"/> And The [[Comics Journal]] reiterated this supportive praise in 2011 by saying, \"''Starstruck'''s reputation as a confusing book unfairly implies that it is a confused book, which it emphatically is not. History, culture, family relationships, religions, vernacular speech, and all manner of written texts from this fantastic world accumulate and intersect with perfect consistency.\"<ref name=\"tcj.com\">John Hilgart. \"[http://www.tcj.com/reviews/17977/  ''Starstruck Deluxe Edition'' review]\", ''The Comics Journal'', August 15, 2011.</ref>  Also praising the innovation, critic W. Andrew Shepard wrote in 2011, \"These sub-texts were more than winking references; they foreshadowed major events in the main narrative and, in keeping with the theme of unreliable narrators, called attention to the ways people construct histories.\"<ref name=\"Riot Grrrls in Space\">W. Andrew Shephard. \"[http://thenewinquiry.com/post/8957901085/riot-grrrls-in-space Riot Grrrls in Space]\", The New Inquiry, August 15, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe series is full of [[unreliable narrator]]s who embroider the facts to suit their agenda, have their facts wrong, see only their part in events, or who miss out completely on what was important:  i.e., another fictional historian is clearly fuzzy on facts that the reader has witnessed differently, though he admits it. Kaluta said they \"are the people we have living today, just regular people that have a way of kidding themselves about as much as they kid other people, sometimes maliciously, sometimes unknowingly.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Later Lee expanded this thought, saying, \"That's something we tried to do throughout ''Starstruck''. A character like Brucilla may exaggerate, others will outright lie and still others may be misinformed. Like life. When you're looking through the eyes of any one character, you'll only get a fraction of the picture.\"<ref name=\"comicbookresources1\"/> Much of the humor in ''Starstruck'''s dialogue lies in the contradictions of their perceptions and actions, as they improvise their way through erratic situations; this has drawn comparisons to director [[Robert Altman]], who favored loose scripts where character interaction was brought out more naturally by improvisation and the overlap of spontaneous dialogue. Critic David Allan Jones wrote of the intricacies of the ''Starstruck'' discourse, \"The (Robert) Altman-esque dialogue style is also a joy to parse out- as confusing and disorienting as it sometimes can be, it's always witty and clever.\"<ref name=\"johnnybacardi.blogspot.com\">David Allan Jones, \"[http://johnnybacardi.blogspot.com/search/label/starstruck Confessions of a Spinner Rack Junkie]\", The Johnny Bacardi Show, August 30, 2009.</ref> The 1984 graphic novel was dedicated to Robert Altman and author [[Thomas Pynchon]], to which Lee explained to an interviewer, \"If regular comics are like a [[Steven Spielberg]] movie, maybe this one is more like a Robert Altman movie.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Peter Sanderson. \"Amazons, Anarchy, And Androids\". ''Amazing Heroes'' #57, (October 15, 1984) P.37.</ref> She stated her admiration of Pynchon's complex allusive style by saying, \"it is dense, it is packed with images. When you're reading Pynchon all sorts of doors open up in your brain.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>\n\nThe series operated on multiple levels, many of which came clear only through rereading, and with some outstanding motifs that have yet to be explained. A reading of the serials and the first six issues may give an overview, with the extras like the Glossary or the play script redefining new additional perspectives, while some deeper levels may only come into focus when the series is ultimately finished: e.g., Queen Glorianna's hand symbols, her ultimate plan, and how the main characters fit into the eventual Great Change she intends. In this sense, ''Starstruck'' is a series that is constantly redefining itself -and the reader's perception of it- as it continues. \"If you want to know everything that is going on, you have to look at the things in the background as well as the figures in the foreground,\" Lee advised in 1984. \"And just let it roll around in your mind.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>\n\nDialogue and sound effects are often used deliberately like a physical element: i.e., two androids converse in four different but simultaneous streams that overwhelm the physical space of the other characters. Elaine Lee told a Suicide Girls interview, \"we did include one scene in the graphic novel where Brucilla's dialogue balloons begin to crowd Galatia off the page, in order to show that the character was a loudmouth.\"<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\"/> Award-winning letterer Todd Klein, who was starting his career when he lettered the first serials, remembers, \"They asked a lot from a newby letterer, and I tried hard to deliver. It was the first time I was called on to letter in a wide variety of styles, and it was good practice for (later) books like [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|''Sandman'']].\"<ref name=\"kleinletters1\">Todd Klein. \"[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/?p=8626 Rereading ''Starstruck'']\", Klein Letters, April 15, 2010.</ref> During their work for Epic Comics, Klein recalls, \"There was a memorable lunch with editor [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and Elaine where she and I went on and on about the minutiae of the lettering while Archie just nodded, looking a bit stunned that there could be so much to say about it.\"<ref name=\"kleinletters1\"/>\n\nThe panel layouts suggest a widescreen film in their arrangement: from the first page onward, a running layout motif of stacked page-wide rectangular panels suggests a cinematic vista, in contrast to the style of tight, multiple panel grids in average comics more similar to television's ratio and rapid editing. By lessening use of the constrictive grid, much of the series simulates the feel of being wide open and watched from a wide view lens. This complements the story's long view perspective while separating itself from other comics with a unique visual narrative style. Kaluta took care to give perspective panoramas of the ''Starstruck'' universe, but to fill them with functional details that ground its reality for the reader and stage its complexity: \"[A]nyone can walk...around inside, go around the outside, around the back, and know that there's going to be something there.\"<ref>Phil Trumbo. \"''Lurking In the Hearts Of Men''\". The Comics Journal #103, (November 1985) P.74.</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=40%|quote=Brucilla filled the archetype of the rowdy, boozing, promiscuous hotshot pilot normally reserved for men, and preceded [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'s [[Kara Thrace]] in doing so by about 20 years. And as an anarchist punk spaceship captain who was arrested in her youth for defacing public property with feminist revisions of nursery rhymes, Galatia-9 was a [[Riot Grrrl]] before the movement existed.<ref name=\"Riot Grrrls in Space\"/>|source= Critic W. Andrew Shepard of ''The New Inquiry'', 2011.}}\n\n===Feminism===\n''Starstruck'' is consistently lauded for its mostly female cast, the depth and range of the individual characters, and the upending of gender and sexual stereotypes through the series.\nThe genesis of this was practical: Elaine Lee formed her theater company as a way for women to create and perform better roles than the 1979 New York scene was offering them, and ''Starstruck'' extended this idea into the universe; she recounts, \"The idea was to do something really wild, so that we could all show off and do parts we would normally never be cast for. I was five feet tall and weighed about 90&nbsp;pounds soaking wet, but I wanted to be an amazon starship captain, so Galatia 9 was the part I came up with for myself.\"<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\"/> At the same time, Lee was reading a lot of [[Feminist science fiction]], which she initially found liberating, but had qualms with the two common themes: the rebel women versus the \"'planet of chauvinist pigs' scenario...began to wear me down. If a fictional world presents you with all the same problems that greet you each day in the office, what fun is that?\" Conversely, the stories focusing on a blissful all-female utopia left her unmoved: \"My main problem with Utopian sci-fi is that nothing ever explodes, and the love scenes are really boring.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">Elaine Lee. \"''BrainBanx'' #1, Helix Comics, March 1997.</ref> With ''Starstruck'' she attempted to lift the discourse out of a dogma of revenge or exclusion into a broader spectrum where personality, skill, and fun drove the characters. In 1997 she wrote, \"Science Fiction is at its best when it offers us new ways to look at our problems. It is silliest when it offers too many (or too little) solutions. Then it is simply an allegory...or worse, propaganda.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/> In 2011, a critical essay from ''The New Inquiry'' lauded this approach: \"But Lee deliberately eschews the separatist narrative and isn't above mocking the knee-jerk misandry which often colored those stories. Instead, our heroine is forced out into the universe at large, where she is confronted with the task of helping to build a society more congruent with her ideals.\"<ref name=\"Riot Grrrls in Space\"/>\n\nWhen ''Starstruck'' moved into the sights of mainstream comics buyers during the Epic Comics run in 1985, the series had to contend with the attitudes of a predominantly young male market. Lee remembers, \"we got quite a reaction to the fact that there were so many female characters in the story. (\"Is the writer a lesbian? Does she have a political agenda? Is the artist gay? Do they both hate men?\") We had to wonder why everyone was so concerned about our sexuality when no one was wondering what [[Gilbert Hernandez]] and [[Jaime Hernandez]] meant by putting all those women in [[Love and Rockets (comics)|''Love and Rockets'']].\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1997\"/> Lee and Kaluta were vocal advocates of ''Love And Rockets'', an indie comics success that also earned critical notice for the breadth of its female cast: Kaluta saw it as further evidence of the mature move to escape the gender role restrictions imposed on women in comics; \"''Love And Rockets'' is an incredibly adult comic strip. You can't fault it, because the characters are real.\"<ref>Phil Trumbo. \"Lurking In the Hearts Of Men\".'' The Comics Journal'' #103, (November 1985) P.52.</ref>  Kaluta dismissed gender categorizers by saying of the ''Starstruck'' characters, \"They're people that don't pander to what you're expecting a female character in a science fiction play or comic book to be, they're just people. If you don't like them, they're not going to change for you.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1985\"/>\n\nCritic [[Robert Rodi]], covering progressive Gay issues in comics for the ''[[Comics Journal]]'' in 1986, wrote, \"''Starstruck'' is an explosion of alternate sexuality and its phenomenal trappings. Characters are (overtly or not) homosexual, heterosexual, asexual, antisexual, omnisexual -you name it, it's there if you look for it.\" <ref>Robert Rodi. \"Sexually Suspect: Rob Rodi on [[P. Craig Russell|Night Music]] and Starstruck\". The'' Comics Journal'' #111, (September 1986) P.51.</ref> In multiple examples the series turns gender cliches inside out: Lee parodied the 'whore' role by empowering the former pleasure droid Erotica Ann; commented on the uselessly pliant 'madonna' role with the passive nuns of the Cloister Of The Goddess Uncaring; dealt with themes of sexuality that erased boundaries between genders, species, and machines; included ritualistic amazons who also like a good bacchanal; and featured a starship captain upfront who owned her sensuality and enjoyed it. The underlying themes in ''Starstruck'' regarding gender and sexuality are consistently [[sex-positive]], anti-sexist, tolerant of sexual preference, anti-[[misogyny]] and anti-[[misandry]], and emphasizing the individual person above any categories. In 2011, a ''Comics Journal'' reviewer wrote, \"Lee and Kaluta deserve a special award for appropriating the entire comic book tradition of women as eye candy for heterosexual male readers and setting those bodies free, throwing the reader's desires and expectations for a loop.\"<ref name=\"tcj.com\"/>\n\nIn 2011, Lee said, \"People thought we had some political agenda, because we had a lot of female characters. Now it's not unusual.\"<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\"/>\n\n===Destiny===\nFate plays an underlying factor in the story: characters who feel that destiny intends greatness for them (Verloona, Bajar, Kalif); those who feel they have been cheated out of a better station (Lucrezia Bajar, Brucilla The Muscle); those that intend to manipulate fate into their own control (Queen Glorianna, Rah El Rex); those that feel fate is meaningless and anything goes (Randall Factor); and those that feel personal focus will get them through random chaos (Galatia 9, the Galactic Girl Guides).\nThe artist said, \"You have to become your own law in a way. There are self-appointed protectors of humanity, some of whom are protecting it for themselves, and some of whom have the idea that there is a better way and will stop things that are against the peoples' interests.\"<ref>Peter Sanderson. ''\"Amazons, Anarchy, And Androids\"''. Amazing Heroes #57, (October 15, 1984) P.30.</ref>\n\n===Satire===\n''Starstruck'' takes aim at many aspects of society.\n\nThese include religion (a sci-fi author who invents a front religion with converts who passively fund a scheme of power and control; and the March Baptists who ally with corrupt corporate dictators for power); gambling (the idle rich who will gamble everything on the mere chance of someone perhaps coming into the room); vanity (a villainess who may have sacrificed many young girls just to stay youthful; and salons where hours of one's lifespan are sold by the poor to rich patrons who want a longer life); militarism (half of the Earth was disintegrated in an act of militaristic paranoia, and then covered up by a hologram; and jingoistic Space Brigades who feel the universe is only there for them to thrust their agenda and control onto); and the arts (conceptual art assassins who eliminate creators of really bad plays; and a conjoined trio of actors turning self-absorbed frilliness into high drama).\n\nReviewer Richard Caldwell wrote, \"The plot is fast-moving and puzzle-like, with strong elements of political intrigue and satire alike cavorting about the omniverse in a futuristic setting where multiple clans struggle for dominance over a mix of cultures as boggled by the theologies of the day as they are by the sensory overload of sensationalistic commercialism that passes for status quo.\"<ref name=\"Starstruck review\">Richard Caldwell. \"[http://thelotteryparty.com/starstruck/ Starstruck review\"]\". The Lottery Party, (Sept. 2, 2012).</ref>\n\n''Starstruck'' initially began its creative life as a stage play spoofing time-worn tropes of Science Fiction. Kaluta recalled his reaction to Lee's script: \"Oh God, I was amazed at how many genres she was actually poking fun at, without being a dyed-in-the-wool science fiction fan. She was poking fun at [[Andre Norton]], she was poking fun at everybody, all the [[E. E. Smith|Doc Smith]] stuff, without ever having read Doc Smith.\"<ref name=\"Steve Ringgenberg 1981 P.93\"/>\n\n===Absurdism===\n''Starstruck'' laces its drama and intrigue with bouts of surrealistic farce, ludicrous slapstick, absurd non-sequiters, random weirdness, cross-communication, cultural parody, and one-liners.\n\nThe writer clarified, \"Of course, it includes some social commentary  -people often comment on the feminism- but it's all comedy. I want people to enjoy it. People accept new ideas and commentary more readily if they're funny.\"<ref>Stephen Moloff. ''\"Stagestruck Starstruck\"''. Heavy Metal, #8311, (November 1983) P.46.</ref> Lee points to the feuding Bajar twins, Kalif and Lucrezia, whose sibling jealousy gets out of hand due to their wealth and power: \"In real life they probably would have just annoyed people in a bar; in comic books they blow people up.\"<ref>Peter Sanderson. ''\"Amazons, Anarchy, And Androids\"''. Amazing Heroes #57, (October 15, 1984) P.34.</ref> The writer saw absurdism as a philosophical antidote or survival perspective in the ''Starstruck'' universe, as well as in its creative process: \"We get real serious about showing the humanity of our characters, and at the same time, we feel that life is silly, and something that seems horribly embarrassing and horribly important is really silly at the same time.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/> Critic [[Robert Rodi]] wrote, \"Lee has reinvented Camp as a new sensibility; it isn't Camp in that it violates all known laws of drama and internal logic for the sake of flamboyance or effect. Rather, she's taken the space opera form and, while respecting the limitations of physics as we know them, pushed the genre's more baroque aspects to their absolute limits.\"<ref>Robert Rodi. \"Sexually Suspect: Rob Rodi on [[P. Craig Russell|Night Music]] and Starstruck\". The Comics Journal #111, (September 1986) P.52.</ref>\n\n===Archetypes===\nThe series takes gender-bending liberties with many iconic female and male roles of world history and popular culture. They include the [[Cowgirl#Cowgirls|Cowgirl]] (the Medea women on their space ranch); [[amazons]] (Galatia 9 and the Omegazon tribe who christened her); [[Bimbo]]/[[sex doll]]s (Erotica Ann and the 333 Annie pleasure droids; and the male droid, Handi Andy); [[valkyrie]]s (Brucilla The Muscle, the flying warrior whose uniform makes her resemble [[Brynhildr|Brunhilda]]); the [[The Faerie Queene|White Queen]] (Queen Glorianna, the tough revolutionary posing as a shining monarch) and the [[Queen (Snow White)|Black Queen]] (Verloona Ti, the devourer of little children); and [[Hardboiled|hardboiled detective]]s (Harry Palmer, the tough pug with a wounded heart).\n\n==Merchandise and collectibles==\n* '''Portfolio''': During the first run of the ''Starstruck'' stage play in 1980, Michael Kaluta illustrated character portraits of six of the main characters. Sal Quartuccio of S. Q. Productions published these as a limited edition portfolio of 2000; the 11\"x14\" prints were in black-and-white, sealed in an envelope which Kaluta signed and numbered.\n* '''T-shirts''': In 1985, Graphitti Designs sold two ''Starstruck'' T-shirts with original art by Kaluta. One profiled Erotica Ann, while the other spotlighted Erotica Ann and her lover, Harry Palmer, both with the ''Starstruck'' logo. These were offered for sale in the Epic Comics issues. In 1990, these shirt designs were amended with the ''Starstruck: The Expanding Universe'' logo, for sale in the Dark Horse issues.\n* '''Buttons''': Kaluta designed color lapel pins with individual characters for Graphitti Designs. Set 1 included Brucilla The Muscle, Galatia 9, Erotica Ann, Verloona Ti, E-V, and a faux Erotica Ann (Mary Medea). A second set with Eeeeeeeeeluh, Bronwyn of The Veil, Rah El Rex, and Kalif Bajar went unrealized.\n* '''Convention Poster''': In 1990, Kaluta did a poster for a comics convention in [[Grenoble]], France, depicting Galactic Girl Guides playing with hand puppets of the ''Starstruck'' cast. The poster was printed in large forms on walls and billboards around the city during the convention.\n* '''WonderCon Convention Program Book''': Also in 1990, Kaluta did a cover for the [[WonderCon]] 5 program book which depicted Galactic Girl Guides on a San Francisco cable car in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] being watched over by The Shadow.\n* '''Comic-Con Volunteer T-shirt''': Volunteers who help out on all four days of the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]] receive \"a rare and extremely limited Comic-Con volunteer t-shirt that is different each year- making the shirts instant collector's items.\"<ref>\"Comic-Con: 40 Years of Artists, Writers, fans, and Friends\", Chronicle Books, (2009) p.172.</ref> The souvenir T-shirt for the 1990 San Diego Comic-Con was a ''Starstruck'' shirt, printed with Kaluta's spoof of [[Dave Stevens]]'s ''[[The Rocketeer]]'' featuring Brucilla The Muscle.<ref>\"Comic-Con: 40 Years of Artists, Writers, fans, and Friends\", Chronicle Books, (2009) p.173.</ref>\n* '''Trading cards''': Two sets of trading cards covering Michael Kaluta's art career were released in the 1990s by publisher Michael Freidlander's imprint, FPG. Series 1 (90 cards, 1994) contained 12 ''Starstruck'' cards, and Series 2 (90 cards, 1995) contained 4 ''Starstruck'' cards. An additional set of cards called Metallic Storms printed on metallic foil contained one more ''Starstruck'' card.\n* '''''Starstruck'' script''': The script of the stage play, based on the revised 1983 production, was published in March 1985, and advertised in the Epic and Dark Horse issues.\n* '''Audioplay''': The first ''Starstruck'' audioplay adaption, based on the play, was released on CD and download from the AudioComics Company in October 2010. A second will become a free download in latter 2011.\n* '''2011 Merchandise''': In September 2011, The AudioComics Company offered new ''Starstruck'' merchandise for sale at its online store through [[Zazzle|Zazzle.com]], each using the art for the audioplay adaption: a new T-shirt, a coffee mug, and a customizable [[iPod Touch]] case. In October 2011, a separate line of new ''Starstruck'' merchandise based on the remastered IDW series was launched, also through an online store on [[Zazzle|Zazzle.com]]: ten different T-shirts in various cuts, which included Brucilla And The Galactic Girl Guides, the Tri-Clone Invasion badge, Galatia And Brucilla The Muscle, The United Federation of Female Freedom Fighters emblem, the villain Verloona with Kalif and Rex, the Skate The Mirror Mission Badge, the Droid Wars Mission Patch, Kalif and the Pleasure Droids, the Bajar twins on a playing card, and the AudioPlay cover art; a coffee mug starring the heroes and another mug for the villains; a poster print of the Vercadian Protector Droid with the Aguatunesian mer-people by Kaluta, and an Aquacade poster designed from Kaluta's original Portfolio portrait of the mermaid [[Mermaids in popular culture|Eeeeeeeeeeluh]] with an update by painter/graphic designer Lee Moyer.\n\n==Screen adaptations==\nIn 1980, Michael Kaluta told ''Future Life ''magazine, \"''Starstruck'' is a big bundle of potential. It has the potential for being a film, a play, a big-budget thing; who knows what.\"<ref>Susan Adamo. \"Feminist Fantasy\".'' Future Life Magazine'' #23, (December 1980) P.9.</ref>\n\nIn various interviews Lee and Kaluta have each spoken of different plans through the 1990s to continue ''Starstruck'' on film or television, consistently emphasizing retention of copyright ownership and creative control. Kaluta said in 1993, \"We own the characters, and we can do whatever we want with to do with them, but when you do what you want with them, the people you do it with will want to own them. Somebody will want to come in and fool with them.\"<ref>Robert J. Sodaro. \"A Conversation With Michael Wm. Kaluta and Joel Goss\", ''Dark Horse Comics Insider'' #30, (June 1994) P.45.</ref>\n\nIn 1990 through 1993, Kaluta worked on a project adapting the concept into movie form, but this came to naught; Kaluta noted in his career biography, \"For Limelight and Largo Entertainment: (1990 - 91) Character, setting, mood and toy prototypes for 'The Adventures of Brucilla the Muscle, ''Galactic Girl Guide''/Guard', sometimes called 'Maddie McPhee and the ''Galactic Girl Guides''' -- a movie spin off of (''Starstruck'')-- in development by Pet Fly Productions for [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]], October 1992.\"<ref>[http://www.kaluta.com/pages/bio/bio.html Kaluta timeline, 1991]</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Kaluta told a Spanish interviewer, \"As always, I am hoping some version of the Starstruck Comic Book will make its way to TV or Film.\"<ref>Armand Zoroa, NORMA Editorial magazine, 2000.</ref>\n\nLee has spoken of negotiations for a TV series circa 2003, where a network bought the option to turn ''Starstruck'' into a live action show in the spirit of [[Firefly (TV Series)|''Firefly'']] or ''[[Farscape]]''. \"I wrote (and was paid for) pitch documents, several scripts and I outlined a season of episodes for them. But when it finally came down to the deal, they asked us to renegotiate our contract, giving them much more control of the property than made us comfortable.

Kaluta was proudest of one from an angry reader that took the creators to task for making him take longer than 15 minutes to read a comic. At the same time, the writer and artist realized they had a series that appealed to a growing segment in the mature market, but was being dismissed by the mainstream superhero audience. As a joke, Kaluta asked Epic to run an ad for Starstruck saying, \"Readers of The World, Unite! You Have Nothing to Use But Your Brains!\", an idea they enjoyed but passed on.<ref>Phil Trumbo. \"''Lurking In the Hearts Of Men''\". The Comics Journal #103, P.63, November 1985.</ref> Addressing their concern for the future of the series, Lee said, \"People have called this a cult book. I hope it's more than that. I hope people will bother to read it and go, 'This is different. Let me give it a try', rather than 'This is different. Let me throw it on the other side of the room from my [[X-Men]] comics'.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>  The Epic series was cancelled in 1986 after six issues, and in its wake within the same year, innovative series like ''[[Watchmen]]'', ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', and ''[[Maus]]'' earned acclaim and success for the mature qualities and sophisticated innovations that ''Starstruck'' was initially resisted for. In the wake of the cancellation, ''[[Comics Journal]]'' critic [[Robert Rodi]] wrote, \"That ''Starstruck'' should owe more to [[Gravity's Rainbow]] and [[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H*]] than to the [[The Galactus Trilogy|Galactus Trilogy]] means that many people who are exclusively comics-literate won't have the necessary aesthetic vocabulary to read it.

Comics media critic Paul Gravett called the collection \"a \"wondrous, ebullient SF epic and it all comes together in this delectable package.

Andrew Shephard of The New Inquiry wrote of the collection, \"''Starstruck'' could be both silly and smart, was progressive but unpretentious, and clever but not so impressed with itself that it ever forgot to entertain.

It was inspired by the [[off-Broadway]] stage [[Starstruck (play)|play]] with the same name written by [[Elaine Lee]], with contributions from [[Susan Norfleet Lee]] and [[Dale Place]].\n\nThe ''Starstruck'' creator-owned illustrated [[science fiction]] serial has been produced at various intervals since 1982 by writer Lee and artist [[Michael Wm. Kaluta]]; their primary collaborators are colorist [[Lee Moyer]] and letterer [[Todd Klein]]. The series, epic in scope, has been carried across multiple comic companies, but primarily by [[Epic Comics]], [[Dark Horse Comics]], and [[IDW Publishing]]. It was collected in a revised and recolored hardcover book form as ''Starstruck Deluxe Edition'' in 2011.\n\n''Starstruck'' is set in an anarchic future in which Humanity spans the universe. The Great Dictator has fallen and a power vacuum sparks a chess game of eccentric players scheming for control. The seriocomic stories follow Captain Galatia 9 and her running partner, Brucilla The Muscle, as they navigate madcap scenarios and surreal misadventures in between the galactic infighting.\n\nSince its inception, ''Starstruck'' has built a cult audience and critical acclaim from peers, periodicals, and fans for the sophistication of its storytelling. Most noted is the predominantly female cast, portrayed by Lee with a range and nuance that confounds gender stereotypes. Kaluta, an esteemed veteran of comics and illustration, is often commended for the virtuosity and imaginative detail of his artwork. Also, the series is cited for the progressiveness of its rich and complex structure: ''Starstruck'' preceded ''[[Watchmen]]'' in using innovations like nonlinear storytelling, overlapping dialogue, multiple story threads, back-up text, unreliable narrators, adjunct stories, underlying themes, recurring symbols, and an almost symphonic interconnectedness.\n\n==Play==\n{{Main|Starstruck (play)}}\n\n[[Elaine Lee]] herself played the adventurous lead, Captain Galatia 9, while Susan Norfleet Lee played her rowdy pilot, Brucilla the Muscle. Noted [[illustrator]] [[Michael Wm. Kaluta]] played a major role in visual aspects of the play, working on sets, costumes and promotional material.<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\">Susan Adamo. ''\"Starstruck: Artist Mike Kaluta's Designs For This SF-Comedy Satire\"''. Starlog Magazine #41, (December 1980) P.24.</ref> The story is set in the future, and features several strong female lead characters.  A strange and gleefully corrupt future version of the [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Guides]], the ''Galactic Girl Guides'', are introduced in a subplot that leads to the climax. The ''Starstruck'' play was produced in 1980, with another staging in 1983.<ref>Elaine Lee, Susan Norfleet, and Dale Place (March 1985). ''Starstruck (A Space Opera)''. Broadway Play Publishing, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-88145-023-1}}</ref>\n\nThe script of the play ({{ISBN|978-0-88145-023-1}}) was published in 1985 and is still available.\n\nAn audioplay adaption was recorded in 2010, and released on CD and download.\n\n===Background and creation===\nElaine Lee was an actor in the late 1970s New York City theatre and television scene. She was nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for her work on the long-running NBC soap opera, [[The Doctors (soap opera)|The Doctors]];<ref>\"[https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000206/1980 Daytime Emmy Awards winners and nominations, 1980]\"</ref> she portrayed the troubled character Mildred Trumble, modeled after [[Sissy Spacek]]'s character, Pinky Rose, in [[Robert Altman]]'s film ''[[3 Women]]''. Seeing a lack of range and depth in the roles being offered to female actors,<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\">Alex Dueben. \"[http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Elaine+Lee:+Starstruck/  Elaine Lee: Starstruck]\", Suicide Girls, April 5, 2011.</ref> she formed a Manhattan theatre company with her sister, Susan Norfleet Lee, and actor friends which they called Wild Hair Productions. The Lees wrote their own plays for the company to star in, starting with \"Brief Cases\".\n\nDuring the writing of a second play, ''The Contamination of the Kokomo Lounge'', Elaine began pulling together ideas for a science fiction play. The Lee sisters were at a Manhattan bar/cafe called The Library, discussing ideas over a pile of science fiction magazines when illustrator [[Michael Wm. Kaluta]], a neighbor who often sketched there, approached them asking, \"Are you science fiction fans?\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\"/> Elaine kept his card for the future.<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\"/> Elaine Lee was subsequently impressed by seeing Kaluta's art in the West Side Comics store, on a poster showcasing [[The Studio (commune)|The Studio]], an art collective he shared with [[Barry Windsor Smith]], [[Jeffrey Catherine Jones|Jeffrey Jones]], and [[Berni Wrightson]].<ref name=\"newsarama1\">Zack Smith. \"[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/060917-STarstruck01.html The Starstruck Chronicles, I: Bringing Starstruck Back.]\" Newsarama, June 17, 2009.</ref> Kaluta was impressed by the wit and range of their second play: he recalled thinking, \"If they're going to do a science fiction play, they're going to do it very well.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\"/>\n\nElaine Lee's first draft was on a stack of 5x7 index cards. Lee wrote all the drafts of the script, with some dialogue suggestions from Susan Norfleet and Dale Place.<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\"/> The quality of the material persuaded Kaluta to create the show poster. He became the costume designer after asking what costumes the actors would wear in the poster, and the set designer when the regular one got sick.<ref name=\"autogenerated1984\">Peter Sanderson. ''\"Amazons, Anarchy, And Androids\"''. Amazing Heroes #57, (October 15, 1984) P.26.</ref> Kaluta told an interviewer backstage about the evolution of his role: \"Should it be like a real 1930s movie poster? That's when I realized I wanted to do characterizations of the entire cast on the poster. But, I had to know what they looked like. So that's when I started designing the costumes. Because I designed them so intricately, I had to build them. And that's when my house started looking like the [[Garment District, Manhattan|garment district]].\"<ref name=\"Steve Ringgenberg 1981 P.93\">Steve Ringgenberg. \"''An Interview With Mike Kaluta''\", The Comic Times Media Showcase #5, (March 1981) P.93.</ref>\n\n''Starstruck'' was being created in the late 1970s period of New York City's decline, when poor musicians in [[DIY ethic|Punk]] and free jazz were making a rising scene out of cheap rents, collective venues, and street throwaways.<ref>Tym Stevens, \"Starstruck: A History...\",'' Starstruck Deluxe Edition'', 2011.  {{ISBN|978-1-60010-872-3}}</ref> \"You could build an entire city on the stuff the city throws away, just sitting out there,\" Kaluta said.<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\"/> The resulting sets, designed in the style of classic science fiction serials, used Hot Wheels tracks, walkie talkies, medical splints, medicine jars full of marbles, Bingo chips, coffee lids, and plastic cups, which Kaluta glue-gunned together with help from his colleague, Fantasy illustrator [[Charles Vess]].\n\nThe ''Starstruck'' play received its first national coverage in an article in ''[[Starlog]]'' magazine #41 in December 1980, which included an interview of Lee and Kaluta, along with Kaluta's design sketches, and stage photos by Sean Smith.<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\"/>\n\n==Comics==\nThe characters and stories of ''Starstruck'' have continued in [[comics]] form across multiple comic companies, but primarily Heavy Metal, Epic, Dark Horse, and IDW.\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=40%|quote=Going from stage to comics, we were able to expand the universe, introduce more characters and scatter them across multiple planets, settings that would be impossible to build.

Kaluta saw a solution but with some reluctance: \"Though I did suggest Elaine do a comic book version of the play when all the rest of the rights were tied up by the then producer, I didn't want to draw the comic book.\"<ref name=\"newsarama2\">Zack Smith. \"[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/060918-Starstruck2.html The Starstruck Chronicles II: Helping Gene Colan]\", Newsarama, June 18, 2009.</ref> Kaluta had initially made his fame as illustrator of [[The Shadow]] comics for [[DC Comics]] in the early 1970s, and was now hesitant to take such a big project on. They also assessed that a dialogue-heavy script on two simple sets would not translate well to the big action and quick captions of comics. \"But the material, and, especially Elaine's witty approach to everything she writes set a small fire under me.\"<ref name=\"newsarama2\"/>\n\nThey found the solution in the backdrop. The stage play had moments where the narrator sketched the backgrounds of each character. Lee and Kaluta had worked out an elaborate backstory of the future time period, the political landscape, the pasts and futures of the characters, and many new characters not seen in the play. This scope of myth-building, inspired by the spirit of ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' and ''[[Star Trek]]'', had been beyond their resources to stage or film.<ref name=\"autogenerated1984\"/> Adapting that dynamic epic to comics proved a better solution than simply adapting the play.\n\nBy 1980, [[Creator ownership|creator-owned]] comics published by [[Alternative comics|independent comics]] publishers were now being sold in an emerging network of [[Direct market|comics stores]]. Lee and Kaluta took this opportunity to expand their storytelling while retaining sole ownership and control of their creative property. Lee would script and Kaluta would illustrate prequel stories that expanded the backdrop and character relationships in a lead-up to the events of the stage play. Since DC and [[Marvel Comics]] were dominated by superheroes, the first market they looked at was the mature comic magazines of Europe.\n\nTheir initial model was [[Heavy Metal (magazine)|''Heavy Metal'']] magazine, which channeled the adult fantasy serials of France's ''[[M\u00e9tal Hurlant]]''. Lee told an interviewer, \"The stuff in ''Heavy Metal'' completely blew me away and I wanted to do a play that was something like the stories they published.\"<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\"/> One year earlier, the original path for ''Starstruck'' had been paved when a fight scene between two women that Elaine had written reminded actor Dale Place of the style of Heavy Metal: \"Oh, that would be fun, to do a kind of science fiction play\" for her company, the writer recounted.<ref name=\"autogenerated1984\"/> Kaluta was a fan of the contributing artist [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]], particularly his kinetic line and non-linear, surprising stories.<ref name=\"autogenerated1985\">Phil Trumbo. \"Lurking In the Hearts Of Men\". ''The Comics Journal'' #103, (November 1985) p. 50.</ref> The ''Starstruck'' prequel series they first produced were firmly in the template of these magazines; hallucinogenic narratives, elaborate fine art, epic backdrops, farcical humor, and adult themes, printed in serialized segments across many issues.\n\n''Starstruck'''s move from New York stage play to comic series anticipated a similar path for ''[[Warp!]]''.<ref name=gcd>{{gcdb series|id=2814|title=''Warp'' (1983 series)}}</ref> This 1971 sci-fi play had played a limited run on Broadway, with Art Direction by comics innovator (and Kaluta's friend/mentor) [[Neal Adams]]. It eventually became a comic series from [[First Comics]] in 1983, after ''Starstruck''. Another contemporary parallel is ''[[A Distant Soil]]'',<ref>{{comicbookdb|type=title|id=6524|title=''A Distant Soil'' (WaRP Graphics)}}</ref> a challenging sci-fi/fantasy series by writer/artist [[Colleen Doran]] which had print runs and revised expansions across multiple alternative comic companies, also starting in 1983.\n\nThe first serials of ''Starstruck'' comics were printed in Spain's'' Ilustracion+Comix Internacional'', and then America's ''Heavy Metal'', in 1982.\n\n==Story==\nCenturies in the future, Earth's population has been halved by a nuclear war. Humanity has emigrated out into the universe, colonizing worlds and interacting with aliens. Various regimes have held power, most recently The Great Dictator. After his overthrow by revolutionaries, a power struggle rages on between his heirs, the Bajars, and the revolutionary leaders, the Medeas. Mary Medea fakes her death and begins an elaborate plan to eventually take control and stabilize the anarchic era. Disguised as a new player, Queen Glorianna, she orchestrates a web of interconnections to achieve what will one day be called The Great Change. The story follows the various pawns and rivals in the game, in evolving stages of their lives and of the scheme, as they all eventually meet and collide. In particular the story focuses on the backstories of Galatia 9, a freedom-fighter amazon, and Brucilla The Muscle, a good-natured hothead pilot; where they came from, how they meet, and what happens because of it.\n\nKaluta explained, \"As the books progress, the reader gets a slow reveal of the greater energies and alliances by the way they impact the lives of the happy-go-lucky space girls and boys eking out their bits of the big ball of wax.\"<ref name=\"newsarama1\"/>\n\n==Characters==\nLee and Kaluta frequently told interviewers they wanted to step away from good-vs.-evil characters to tell stories of flawed people who were too slippery for such boundaries. The writer said, \"In our comic book the 'good guys' are not all good, and the 'bad guys' are not totally bad, and the characters do really stupid things. These characters all have faults. [But they] get smarter, just as people learn things in life.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Peter Sanderson. ''\"Amazons, Anarchy, And Androids\"''. Amazing Heroes #57, (October 15, 1984) P.32.</ref> The artist said, \"There is no ruler of the universe making other people dance. But there's lots of people in the comic who think they're making other people dance. And that's where the fun is, to watch the characters delude themselves.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1985\"/>\n\nThe cast of the comics are based on the likenesses of the original stage ensemble. Lee explains that when they started the first serials, \"Michael drew the characters in ''Starstruck'' to look like the actors in the original production.\"<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\"/> This included the troupe of Wild Hair Productions as well as extended friends.

This material was expanded by 100 pages for [[Dark Horse Comics]] (up to and including Epic #1); this same material was later refined and recolored for [[IDW Publishing]].\n\nThis is known as Volume 1, and was collected in the ''Starstruck Deluxe Edition''. Two or three more volumes are planned, with 220 pages of unpublished new story material expanding the remaining five Epic issues.\n\n===Comix Internacional, 1982===\nThe first ''Starstruck'' stories were printed in Spain starting in April 1982, in the anthology magazine ''[[Comix Internacional|Ilustracion+Comix Internacional]]'' #17.<ref>Tym Stevens, \"Starstruck: A History...\", ''Starstruck Deluxe Edition'', 2011.  {{ISBN|978-1-60010-872-3}}</ref> The magazine was an equivalent to ''[[Metal Hurlant]]'' and [[Heavy Metal (magazine)|''Heavy Metal'']], printing countercultural science fiction and fantasy comics with adult themes and sexuality.  Editor [[Selecciones Ilustradas|Josep Toutain]] was an artist and artists agent representing the wave of Spanish talent who had rejuvenated [[Warren Publishing]] titles like ''[[Vampirella]]'' and ''[[Creepy (magazine)|Creepy]]'' in the mid-1970s; he ran the European branch of Warren, then took it over, and expanded into other imprints and graphic novels.<ref>Jon B. Cooke, David A. Roach. ''The Warren Companion'', Appendix i, p.265, TwoMorrows Publishing, 2001.</ref> Toutain also reprinted innovative strips by American artists like [[Will Eisner]], [[Richard Corben]], and [[Howard Chaykin]], and it was in his variation of Warren's Comix International that ''Starstruck'' made its debut.\n\nThe color was provided by an uncredited Spanish coloring house, who added rich watercolor-esque hues working from the color cues provided by Kaluta.\n\nThe stories ran as serialized vignettes across seven issues: from April to November 1982, skipping the September issue and doubling the length in the October issue.<ref>\"Ilustracion+Comix Internacional\" #17-21, 23; Spain, 1982.</ref>\n\n''Starstruck'' was on the front cover of ''Ilustracion+Comix Internacional ''#17 (April 1982), featuring Kaluta's watercolor art of the warrior/poet droid, Veep 7, and the large headline \"Estrenamos Aqui un Espectaculo de Broadway Llevado al Comic por Mike W. Kaluta y Elaine Lee: Starstruck\".\n\n''Starstruck'' was also on the front cover of ''Ilustracion+Comix Internacional'' #23, using a portrait piece of Erotica Ann from the limited edition ''Starstruck'' portfolio, printed in color for the first time. The headline read: \"La Increible Fantasia de Mike Kaluta\".\n\n===Heavy Metal, 1982===\nThe ''Starstruck'' stories were then picked up for their first American printing by [[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]], edited by Julie Simmons-Lynch. They were run as chapters averaging about seven to eight pages each across nine issues from November 1982, to July 1983.<ref>Heavy Metal #8211-8307/a.k.a., Vol. 6, #8-12-Vol. 7, 1-4; HM Communications, 1982.</ref><ref>\"[http://www.heavymetalmagazinefanpage.com/hmlist83.html Heavy Metal checklist]\"</ref>\n\nThe magazine traded often on Kaluta's fame in comic art circles, running bylines for him on the front and back covers to promote interest. ''Starstruck'' was front-loaded as the first story in the initial issues.\n\nThe Art Director at the time was [[John Workman]], who would also letter much of the later Epic Comics run, as well as the eventual ''Galactic Girl Guides'' back-up stories.\n\nThe English lettering was done by [[Todd Klein]], who was then beginning his career.<ref name=\"kleinletters8626\">Todd Klein, \"[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/?p=8626 And Then I Read: Starstruck 3-7]\", April 15, 2010.</ref>\n\nIn the seventh issue, May 1983, a five-page article was included called \"Stagestruck ''Starstruck''\" by contributing Editor Stephen Maloff, with an overview of the play's two productions and its transition to mature comics. The Lee and Kaluta interviews were supplemented with art examples and color photos of the stage play shot by Sean Smith.<ref>Stephen Moloff. ''\"Stagestruck Starstruck\"''. Heavy Metal, #8311, (November 1983) P.45.</ref>\n\n===Marvel Graphic Novel, 1984===\nThe entirety of the ''Comix Internacional/Heavy Metal'' stories were published together in their first collected form in ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]] ''#13 in September 1984, titled ''Starstruck: The Luckless, the Abandoned and Forsaked''.<!-- NOT \"THE\" FORSAKED ... the title is a Quote from Bob Dylan's 'Chimes of Freedom'--> {{ISBN|978-0-87135-001-5}}\n\nThis retained the Spanish color, with a few tweaks and additions in the stories. When Marvel editorial expressed concern at the violence in a scene where space amazons defeat beastly hillbillies, Elaine Lee added a war song that repeated the refrain, \"The Dromes were bad (x6), so we had to kill them.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1984\"/><ref>Commander Rick. \"Prisoners of Gravity: Censorship\", Canadian television interview program, October 25, 1990.</ref>\n\nMarvel Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter recommended cutting three pages, and adding three new pages. The sequence with young Bronwyn falling into the tank of empathic merpeople was cut from the Graphic Novel, but restored and expanded in the later Dark Horse series.\n\nThe subtitle was a lyric quote from [[Bob Dylan]]'s 1964 song \"[[Chimes of Freedom (song)|Chimes of Freedom]]\".\n\nThe graphic novel, dedicated to director [[Robert Altman]] and author [[Thomas Pynchon]], included a four-page glossary in the back that expanded upon references in the story, much in the spirit of the concurrent work of [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. This became an ongoing tradition in the future issues.\n\n''Starstruck: The Luckless, the Abandoned and Forsaked'' was nominated for a [[Kirby Award|Jack Kirby Award]] as The Best Graphic Album of 1985.<ref name=\"hahnlibrary1985\">\"[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kirby85.php Jack Kirby Award nomination, 1985]\"</ref>\n\n===Epic Comics, 1985===\nMarvel's imprint, [[Epic Comics]], was created as an outlet for creator-owned, mature, experimental comics series. Editor [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] spun the acclaim and success of the ''Starstruck'' graphic novel into an ongoing series by Lee and Kaluta. These were the first story expansions past the initial run of serial stories printed in ''Ilustracion+Comix International'','' Heavy Metal'', and the ''Marvel Graphic Novel''.\n\nAn in-house Marvel promotional magazine, ''[[Marvel Age]]'', issue #15 (June 1984), did a cover story on Archie Goodwin and his editing of the new Epic comics titles and ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' magazine. A cover cartoon of Epic characters by [[Rick Parker (artist)|Rick Parker]] included Brucilla the Muscle as well as her Tiger Brigade shark ship; oddly, no mention was made of the impending ''Starstruck'' graphic novel released two months later, or the new Epic book series seven months away.<ref>Mark Lerer. ''Marvel Age'' #15, June 1984.</ref>\n\nThe new series ran for six bi-monthly issues cover-dated from February 1985, to February 1986. Archie Goodwin took a hands-off approach to editing, saying \"I could edit this, but I would ruin it.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Starstruck #13, IDW Publishing, September 2010.</ref>\n\nThe first two issues were colored by Elaine Lee, and then followed by [[Steve Oliff]]. The first two were lettered by [[Ken Bruzenak]], and then followed by the creators' former [[Heavy Metal (magazine)|''Heavy Metal'']] colleague [[John Workman]].\n\nThe story arc introduced Harry Palmer, a character inspired by noir detective fiction who opened the doors on much of Queen Glorianna's past and her future plans. Lee cites this as her favorite character, and the only love story she ever wrote.\n\nA trio of ''Galactic Girl Guides'' became a running thread through the issues. One of the Guides would become a crucial historian in the future, the person credited for all the barbed and humorous Glossary entries.\n\nThe Epic issues ran ads for purchasing the two ''Starstruck'' T-shirts, the art portfolio, and the stage play script.\n\n''[[Amazing Heroes]]'' #57 ran an article by comic historian and writer [[Peter Sanderson]] about the new Epic series, featuring Brucilla the Muscle on the cover, on October 15, 1984. It extensively covered the origins and outgrowth of ''Starstruck'' from the two stage productions into the serial comics stories, and was the first article to extend coverage to the new bi-monthly comic book. Lee and Kaluta were interviewed, with comic and portfolio art, and stage photos.<ref name=\"autogenerated1984\"/>\n\n''[[Comics Journal]]'' #103 did a cover story and career overview interview with Michael Kaluta in November 1985. The cover featured ''Starstruck'''s Erotica Ann disrobing from [[The Shadow]]'s cloak while saying, \"Is this really what it takes to get your attention?\" Kaluta spoke at length about the genesis and development of the ''Starstruck'' play and comics.<ref name=\"autogenerated1985\"/> ''Comics Journal'' #111 featured an extensive review of ''Starstruck'' in September 1986, praising it for its intelligence and progressive approach to gender and sexual identity issues.<ref>Robert Rodi. \"Sexually Suspect: Rob Rodi on [[P. Craig Russell|Night Music]] and Starstruck\". ''The Comics Journal'' #111, (September 1986) P.48-54.</ref>\n\n''[[Marvel Age]]'' #26 did a cover story in July 1985; the Marvel promotional magazine featured a Kaluta cover of Brucilla the Muscle with Malcolm Trueheart thrown over her shoulder, a gender-flipping spoof of a popular [[Dave Stevens]] drawing of the [[Rocketeer]] with Betty thrown over his shoulder.<ref>Marvel Age #26, July 1985.</ref> In the oval frame surrounding the figures, sign language hands using finger spelling cues signal the phrase, \"Thanks Dave, Cliff, and Betty!\"\n\nThe cover for the Colorado Comic Art Con V program book (1985) featured ''Starstruck'' characters Galatia 9 and Brucilla the Muscle, with art by Kaluta.\n\n===Comico Comics, 1987===\nWhen the Epic Comics series ended, Lee and Kaluta tried a different approach. They created two stories about the ''Galactic Girl Guides'', published as back-up strips in [[Dave Stevens]]'s ''[[The Rocketeer]] Adventure Magazine'' from [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico Comics]] in 1987 and '88. These stories focused on the youthful misadventures of Brucilla the Muscle and her two friends as they became Guides, and were done in a lighter slapstick tone in the tradition of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] and [[Our Gang]]. Fantasy illustrator [[Charles Vess]], a long-time colleague of Kaluta's who had helped him create costumes and props for the play, was the inker.\n\nLee and Kaluta intended this kid-friendly approach, without the trappings of the epic backstory, as an easier portal to the ''Starstruck'' universe for new readers. More stories were planned until a long lag in continuing the [[Rocketeer]]'s adventures put the idea on hold, but the ''Guides'' series would be returned to in the coming years.\n\n===Dark Horse Comics, 1990===\nWhen Dark Horse Comics contacted Kaluta for a job, he thought they were approaching him for continuing ''Starstruck''. Editor Randy Spradley was delighted by the idea, and the first ''Starstruck'' revival began.<ref name=\"newsarama1\"/> Dark Horse had noted that Epic Comics series which, like ''Starstruck'', had not sold well in the limited release of comic stores were finding their audiences as collected trade collections, such as ''[[Moonshadow (comics)|Moonshadow]]'' and ''[[Elektra: Assassin]]''. They felt the time was now fortuitous to do a new graphic novel collection.<ref name=\"autogenerated1990\">Mark Askwith, ''Starstruck: The Expanding Universe'' #1, August 1990.</ref>\n\nLee and Kaluta unveiled ''Starstruck: The Expanding Universe''. Instead of starting with new stories or just collecting the finished ones into a trade paperback, the two creators decided to essentially start over: the initial series would actually be the original graphic novel and Epic issues, but with huge expansions of new story and art inside of them, to be followed by all-new material encompassing the remaining stories they had not done yet. They envisioned three printing arcs, each a volume in the total history of ''Starstruck''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1990\"/>\n\nThe first four issues were published as \"Volume 1\" from August 1990, to March 1991, with over 100 pages of new material that substantially redefined and expanded everything printed before. \"Volume 1\" included the Graphic Novel, the expanded material, and ended after the first Epic Comics issue.\n\nIn the editorial page of the premiere issue, the publishing plan was outlined: there would be twelve total issues, divided as three volumes; each volume would be four issues each, separated with short publishing breaks between, and would include a total of 320 pages of new material,<ref name=\"autogenerated1990\"/> \"Volume 2\" would have continued into the Epic issues, expanding greatly on the Harry Palmer storyline. It was left undefined in the press release whether the third volume would also consist of the remaining Epic issues with new material, or instead be all-new material following those stories, such as an adaption of the stage play itself, or a dramatization of the \"Great Change\" event that the series' Glossary often refers to as the ultimate fruition of the narrative.\n\nThe four issues were printed this time in black-and-white. This was the first time that the initial 80 pages of Graphic Novel material had been printed in the smaller comic book size. Because that art had originally been formatted for a magazine medium with squarer dimensions, these pages now had about 20% white space at the bottom of the more rectangular comics format pages. This evened out in the latter part of the fourth issue, with the reprinting of the first Epic Comics issue, which was originally done in the regular comic size dimensions.\n\nTodd Klein returned, supplementing his original lettering of the Graphic Novel era stories by completely relettering the reprint of Epic issue #1, which had first been lettered by Ken Bruzenak.\n\nThe second issue began the introductory story summaries by fan [[Lee Moyer]], who would later renovate the series with his lavish color for the IDW remastered revival.<ref>Lee Moyer, ''Starstruck: The Expanding Universe'' #2, October 1990.</ref>\n\nThe Dark Horse issues ran ads for purchasing the two ''Starstruck'' T-shirts, the portfolio, and the stage play script. Dark Horse also used a ''Starstruck'' character on the cover of their anthology series, \"[[Cheval Noir (comics)|Cheval Noir]]\" #18 (May, 1991);<ref>[http://www.comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=82143 Cheval Noir at Comic Book Database]</ref> a painting by Kaluta of the fighter droid Veep 7.\n\nKaluta did the cover and some amount of new interior art for the unpublished fifth issue which would begin Volume 2, but -while simultaneously doing production design for various TV shows- a state of exhaustion wore him down.<ref>[http://www.kaluta.com/pages/bio/bio.html Kaluta career timeline, 1991.]</ref> Dark Horse printed no further issues after the fourth, leaving the series revival in hiatus.\n\n===Tundra Comics, 1990s===\nThrough the 1990s, attempts were made to continue ''Starstruck'' in some comics form.\n\nIn interviews, Michael Kaluta has detailed a successive attempt to do new ''Galactic Girl Guides'' stories. Five issues intended for [[Tundra Publishing]] were plotted by him along with writer Phil Trumbo, and illustrated by [[Linda Medley]] with lettering by Todd Klein.<ref name=\"kleinletters8626\"/> Lee recalls, \"Michael and I were supposed to have done the ''Galactic Girl Guides'' for [[Kevin Eastman]]'s company, Tundra Comics. But when Tundra was bought by Kitchen Sink, the project was cancelled.\"<ref name=\"comicbookresources1\"/>\n\nKaluta's website mentions that in 1996 he was \"(s)till drawing ''Starstruck, the Expanding Universe'' for Dark Horse Comics. The first collection is to be published by Marlowe & Co. in the fall of 1996. Marlowe chokes and refuses to publish. Project dead.\"<ref>[http://www.kaluta.com/pages/bio/bio.html Kaluta career timeline, 1996]</ref> This implied that there was a chance at a graphic novel collection of the Volume 1 expanded stories, while Kaluta was also working further on completing expanded story art for Volume 2.\n\nIn 1995, Kaluta also contributed art to a story in Elaine Lee's erotic graphic novel, \"''Skin Tight Orbit'', Volume 1\", which is considered to be somewhere within the ''Starstruck'' universe; \"The Next Best Thing...\" was initially published in [[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]].<ref>Heavy Metal, Vol.17, No.1, March 1993.</ref> Also, three stories drawn by [[Mary Wilshire]] star a character who looks like Galatia 9, with references to ''Starstruck'' such as the Handi Andy pleasure droid.<ref>Elaine Lee. \"''Skin Tight Orbit'', volume 1\", NBM/Amerotica, 1995.</ref>\n\n===IDW Revival, 2009===\nIn May 2009, [[IDW Publishing]] announced that the ''Starstruck'' comic book series would be published again.<ref name=\"newsarama1\"/> These 13 monthly issues were a remastering of the Dark Horse ''\"Expanded Universe\"'' series: the original graphic novel, the 100 pages of added material, and the first Epic Comics issue. Kaluta now expanded the bulk of the art pages from the square format to the full rectangular format with new art. Painter [[Lee Moyer]] did a lush and complex revamping of all the color using contemporary digital technology. Besides the revised version of \"Volume 1\", the two ''Galactic Girl Guides'' stories first printed by Comico would now be reprinted along with several other unpublished GGG stories from that era, inked by Charles Vess and lettered by John Workman.\n\nAdditionally, there were new pin-ups, and revised entries in the Glossary. Fan artists were given a spotlight in a few issues: CG diagrams of the ship, The Harpy, were provided by Walt Carter;<ref>Starstruck #11, IDW Publishing, July 2010.</ref> and Kristina Carroll did a painting of art assassin Kettle Black in a scene alluded to in text but never previously shown before.<ref>Starstruck #10, IDW Publishing, June 2010.</ref> A new color fumetti-story concluded the final issue, using some of Sean Smith's play photos, which included Elaine Lee as Galatia 9 and Susan Norfleet Lee as Brucilla the Muscle.\n\nThe first issue was released on August 12, 2009 and the series was completed in September 2010. The final afterword stated, \"This is not the end!

Additionally the art was newly increased by 20% on each page by Kaluta in 2009, and new color was painted by Lee Moyer.

''The Comics Journal'' #111, (September 1986) pp. 52-53.</ref>|source= Critic [[Robert Rodi]] for the ''[[Comics Journal]]'', 1986.}}\n\n''Starstruck'' is lauded critically as a landmark advance in comics storytelling methods, recognized in retrospect for using innovations years ahead of ''[[Watchmen]]'', which is commonly praised for them. Like its parallel descendants ''[[Watchmen]]'' and ''[[From Hell]]'', the series is a large mosaic of seemingly random but steadily interlocking people and events.\n\nThe series started in 1982 by eschewing the then standard superhero formula of one male character in self-contained stories, instead using an ensemble of mainly female characters in multiple intwined story threads. The original first 73 pages of serial stories covered a span of nearly three decades, on different planets, with a wide and seemingly unconnected cast, which ultimately led to everyone coming to one space station at the same time. \"There is no reason why a story written for a comic shouldn't be every bit as involving as the plot of a novel,\" Lee wrote in 1997. \"It's a wonderful form, and it can be stretched as far as creators and publishers are willing to go with it.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1997\">Elaine Lee. ''BrainBanx'' #5, Helix Comics, July 1997.</ref> In one sense, the series was [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear]] by the sheer span of its subjects, the episodic glimpses of them in different times and places, their flashback sequences, the element of perceived randomness altering their paths, and the uncertainty of their connectedness: an uncommon narrative strategy that now draws comparisons to critically successful TV shows like [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']]. In another sense, the series is a very particularly linear story -going so far as to detail the births and maturing of pivotal characters- which is too large to be seen all at once: a novelistic narrative now seen similarly in critically praised TV shows like ''[[The Wire]]''. The writer said in 2009, \"When we were first published, people were used to comics with linear stories about a main character. But now, with an audience used to shows like [[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|''Heroes'']] and  ''Lost'', with large casts and non-linear storylines, we're hoping that ''Starstruck'' will find an even larger readership.\"<ref name=\"newsarama2\"/>\n\n''Starstruck'' used supplement texts as a dramatic expansion of the story. The Glossary, written by one fictional historian, went past defining references in the dialogue to sketching out the past, present, and future of the characters and their universe. Writer [[Alan Moore]] would do something similar afterward, more simply in ''[[Watchmen]] ''(1985) and much more extensively in his ''[[League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen]] ''(1999). ''Starstruck'' can be considered one of comics' premiere [[hypertext fiction]]s, in the sense of using supplementary texts, adjunct stories, and ancillary art to expand, deepen, and even alter the narrative experience. [[Comics Journal]] praised this innovation in 1986: \"The (Space) Brigade's origin in the Graphic Novel's glossary section, is hilarious; in general, the ''Starstruck'' glossaries provide as much mirth as the series itself.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated1986\"/> And The [[Comics Journal]] reiterated this supportive praise in 2011 by saying, \"''Starstruck'''s reputation as a confusing book unfairly implies that it is a confused book, which it emphatically is not. History, culture, family relationships, religions, vernacular speech, and all manner of written texts from this fantastic world accumulate and intersect with perfect consistency.\"<ref name=\"tcj.com\">John Hilgart. \"[http://www.tcj.com/reviews/17977/  ''Starstruck Deluxe Edition'' review]\", ''The Comics Journal'', August 15, 2011.</ref>  Also praising the innovation, critic W. Andrew Shepard wrote in 2011, \"These sub-texts were more than winking references; they foreshadowed major events in the main narrative and, in keeping with the theme of unreliable narrators, called attention to the ways people construct histories.\"<ref name=\"Riot Grrrls in Space\">W. Andrew Shephard. \"[http://thenewinquiry.com/post/8957901085/riot-grrrls-in-space Riot Grrrls in Space]\", The New Inquiry, August 15, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe series is full of [[unreliable narrator]]s who embroider the facts to suit their agenda, have their facts wrong, see only their part in events, or who miss out completely on what was important:  i.e., another fictional historian is clearly fuzzy on facts that the reader has witnessed differently, though he admits it. Kaluta said they \"are the people we have living today, just regular people that have a way of kidding themselves about as much as they kid other people, sometimes maliciously, sometimes unknowingly.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Later Lee expanded this thought, saying, \"That's something we tried to do throughout ''Starstruck''. A character like Brucilla may exaggerate, others will outright lie and still others may be misinformed. Like life. When you're looking through the eyes of any one character, you'll only get a fraction of the picture.\"<ref name=\"comicbookresources1\"/> Much of the humor in ''Starstruck'''s dialogue lies in the contradictions of their perceptions and actions, as they improvise their way through erratic situations; this has drawn comparisons to director [[Robert Altman]], who favored loose scripts where character interaction was brought out more naturally by improvisation and the overlap of spontaneous dialogue. Critic David Allan Jones wrote of the intricacies of the ''Starstruck'' discourse, \"The (Robert) Altman-esque dialogue style is also a joy to parse out- as confusing and disorienting as it sometimes can be, it's always witty and clever.\"<ref name=\"johnnybacardi.blogspot.com\">David Allan Jones, \"[http://johnnybacardi.blogspot.com/search/label/starstruck Confessions of a Spinner Rack Junkie]\", The Johnny Bacardi Show, August 30, 2009.</ref> The 1984 graphic novel was dedicated to Robert Altman and author [[Thomas Pynchon]], to which Lee explained to an interviewer, \"If regular comics are like a [[Steven Spielberg]] movie, maybe this one is more like a Robert Altman movie.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Peter Sanderson. \"Amazons, Anarchy, And Androids\". ''Amazing Heroes'' #57, (October 15, 1984) P.37.</ref> She stated her admiration of Pynchon's complex allusive style by saying, \"it is dense, it is packed with images. When you're reading Pynchon all sorts of doors open up in your brain.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>\n\nThe series operated on multiple levels, many of which came clear only through rereading, and with some outstanding motifs that have yet to be explained. A reading of the serials and the first six issues may give an overview, with the extras like the Glossary or the play script redefining new additional perspectives, while some deeper levels may only come into focus when the series is ultimately finished: e.g., Queen Glorianna's hand symbols, her ultimate plan, and how the main characters fit into the eventual Great Change she intends. In this sense, ''Starstruck'' is a series that is constantly redefining itself -and the reader's perception of it- as it continues. \"If you want to know everything that is going on, you have to look at the things in the background as well as the figures in the foreground,\" Lee advised in 1984. \"And just let it roll around in your mind.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>\n\nDialogue and sound effects are often used deliberately like a physical element: i.e., two androids converse in four different but simultaneous streams that overwhelm the physical space of the other characters. Elaine Lee told a Suicide Girls interview, \"we did include one scene in the graphic novel where Brucilla's dialogue balloons begin to crowd Galatia off the page, in order to show that the character was a loudmouth.\"<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\"/> Award-winning letterer Todd Klein, who was starting his career when he lettered the first serials, remembers, \"They asked a lot from a newby letterer, and I tried hard to deliver. It was the first time I was called on to letter in a wide variety of styles, and it was good practice for (later) books like [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|''Sandman'']].\"<ref name=\"kleinletters1\">Todd Klein. \"[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/?p=8626 Rereading ''Starstruck'']\", Klein Letters, April 15, 2010.</ref> During their work for Epic Comics, Klein recalls, \"There was a memorable lunch with editor [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and Elaine where she and I went on and on about the minutiae of the lettering while Archie just nodded, looking a bit stunned that there could be so much to say about it.\"<ref name=\"kleinletters1\"/>\n\nThe panel layouts suggest a widescreen film in their arrangement: from the first page onward, a running layout motif of stacked page-wide rectangular panels suggests a cinematic vista, in contrast to the style of tight, multiple panel grids in average comics more similar to television's ratio and rapid editing. By lessening use of the constrictive grid, much of the series simulates the feel of being wide open and watched from a wide view lens. This complements the story's long view perspective while separating itself from other comics with a unique visual narrative style. Kaluta took care to give perspective panoramas of the ''Starstruck'' universe, but to fill them with functional details that ground its reality for the reader and stage its complexity: \"[A]nyone can walk...around inside, go around the outside, around the back, and know that there's going to be something there.\"<ref>Phil Trumbo. \"''Lurking In the Hearts Of Men''\". The Comics Journal #103, (November 1985) P.74.</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=40%|quote=Brucilla filled the archetype of the rowdy, boozing, promiscuous hotshot pilot normally reserved for men, and preceded [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'s [[Kara Thrace]] in doing so by about 20 years. And as an anarchist punk spaceship captain who was arrested in her youth for defacing public property with feminist revisions of nursery rhymes, Galatia-9 was a [[Riot Grrrl]] before the movement existed.<ref name=\"Riot Grrrls in Space\"/>|source= Critic W. Andrew Shepard of ''The New Inquiry'', 2011.}}\n\n===Feminism===\n''Starstruck'' is consistently lauded for its mostly female cast, the depth and range of the individual characters, and the upending of gender and sexual stereotypes through the series.\nThe genesis of this was practical: Elaine Lee formed her theater company as a way for women to create and perform better roles than the 1979 New York scene was offering them, and ''Starstruck'' extended this idea into the universe; she recounts, \"The idea was to do something really wild, so that we could all show off and do parts we would normally never be cast for. I was five feet tall and weighed about 90&nbsp;pounds soaking wet, but I wanted to be an amazon starship captain, so Galatia 9 was the part I came up with for myself.\"<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\"/> At the same time, Lee was reading a lot of [[Feminist science fiction]], which she initially found liberating, but had qualms with the two common themes: the rebel women versus the \"'planet of chauvinist pigs' scenario...began to wear me down. If a fictional world presents you with all the same problems that greet you each day in the office, what fun is that?\" Conversely, the stories focusing on a blissful all-female utopia left her unmoved: \"My main problem with Utopian sci-fi is that nothing ever explodes, and the love scenes are really boring.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">Elaine Lee. \"''BrainBanx'' #1, Helix Comics, March 1997.</ref> With ''Starstruck'' she attempted to lift the discourse out of a dogma of revenge or exclusion into a broader spectrum where personality, skill, and fun drove the characters. In 1997 she wrote, \"Science Fiction is at its best when it offers us new ways to look at our problems. It is silliest when it offers too many (or too little) solutions. Then it is simply an allegory...or worse, propaganda.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/> In 2011, a critical essay from ''The New Inquiry'' lauded this approach: \"But Lee deliberately eschews the separatist narrative and isn't above mocking the knee-jerk misandry which often colored those stories. Instead, our heroine is forced out into the universe at large, where she is confronted with the task of helping to build a society more congruent with her ideals.\"<ref name=\"Riot Grrrls in Space\"/>\n\nWhen ''Starstruck'' moved into the sights of mainstream comics buyers during the Epic Comics run in 1985, the series had to contend with the attitudes of a predominantly young male market. Lee remembers, \"we got quite a reaction to the fact that there were so many female characters in the story. (\"Is the writer a lesbian? Does she have a political agenda? Is the artist gay? Do they both hate men?\") We had to wonder why everyone was so concerned about our sexuality when no one was wondering what [[Gilbert Hernandez]] and [[Jaime Hernandez]] meant by putting all those women in [[Love and Rockets (comics)|''Love and Rockets'']].\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1997\"/> Lee and Kaluta were vocal advocates of ''Love And Rockets'', an indie comics success that also earned critical notice for the breadth of its female cast: Kaluta saw it as further evidence of the mature move to escape the gender role restrictions imposed on women in comics; \"''Love And Rockets'' is an incredibly adult comic strip. You can't fault it, because the characters are real.\"<ref>Phil Trumbo. \"Lurking In the Hearts Of Men\".'' The Comics Journal'' #103, (November 1985) P.52.</ref>  Kaluta dismissed gender categorizers by saying of the ''Starstruck'' characters, \"They're people that don't pander to what you're expecting a female character in a science fiction play or comic book to be, they're just people. If you don't like them, they're not going to change for you.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1985\"/>\n\nCritic [[Robert Rodi]], covering progressive Gay issues in comics for the ''[[Comics Journal]]'' in 1986, wrote, \"''Starstruck'' is an explosion of alternate sexuality and its phenomenal trappings. Characters are (overtly or not) homosexual, heterosexual, asexual, antisexual, omnisexual -you name it, it's there if you look for it.\" <ref>Robert Rodi. \"Sexually Suspect: Rob Rodi on [[P. Craig Russell|Night Music]] and Starstruck\". The'' Comics Journal'' #111, (September 1986) P.51.</ref> In multiple examples the series turns gender cliches inside out: Lee parodied the 'whore' role by empowering the former pleasure droid Erotica Ann; commented on the uselessly pliant 'madonna' role with the passive nuns of the Cloister Of The Goddess Uncaring; dealt with themes of sexuality that erased boundaries between genders, species, and machines; included ritualistic amazons who also like a good bacchanal; and featured a starship captain upfront who owned her sensuality and enjoyed it. The underlying themes in ''Starstruck'' regarding gender and sexuality are consistently [[sex-positive]], anti-sexist, tolerant of sexual preference, anti-[[misogyny]] and anti-[[misandry]], and emphasizing the individual person above any categories. In 2011, a ''Comics Journal'' reviewer wrote, \"Lee and Kaluta deserve a special award for appropriating the entire comic book tradition of women as eye candy for heterosexual male readers and setting those bodies free, throwing the reader's desires and expectations for a loop.\"<ref name=\"tcj.com\"/>\n\nIn 2011, Lee said, \"People thought we had some political agenda, because we had a lot of female characters. Now it's not unusual.\"<ref name=\"suicidegirls1\"/>\n\n===Destiny===\nFate plays an underlying factor in the story: characters who feel that destiny intends greatness for them (Verloona, Bajar, Kalif); those who feel they have been cheated out of a better station (Lucrezia Bajar, Brucilla The Muscle); those that intend to manipulate fate into their own control (Queen Glorianna, Rah El Rex); those that feel fate is meaningless and anything goes (Randall Factor); and those that feel personal focus will get them through random chaos (Galatia 9, the Galactic Girl Guides).\nThe artist said, \"You have to become your own law in a way. There are self-appointed protectors of humanity, some of whom are protecting it for themselves, and some of whom have the idea that there is a better way and will stop things that are against the peoples' interests.\"<ref>Peter Sanderson. ''\"Amazons, Anarchy, And Androids\"''. Amazing Heroes #57, (October 15, 1984) P.30.</ref>\n\n===Satire===\n''Starstruck'' takes aim at many aspects of society.\n\nThese include religion (a sci-fi author who invents a front religion with converts who passively fund a scheme of power and control; and the March Baptists who ally with corrupt corporate dictators for power); gambling (the idle rich who will gamble everything on the mere chance of someone perhaps coming into the room); vanity (a villainess who may have sacrificed many young girls just to stay youthful; and salons where hours of one's lifespan are sold by the poor to rich patrons who want a longer life); militarism (half of the Earth was disintegrated in an act of militaristic paranoia, and then covered up by a hologram; and jingoistic Space Brigades who feel the universe is only there for them to thrust their agenda and control onto); and the arts (conceptual art assassins who eliminate creators of really bad plays; and a conjoined trio of actors turning self-absorbed frilliness into high drama).\n\nReviewer Richard Caldwell wrote, \"The plot is fast-moving and puzzle-like, with strong elements of political intrigue and satire alike cavorting about the omniverse in a futuristic setting where multiple clans struggle for dominance over a mix of cultures as boggled by the theologies of the day as they are by the sensory overload of sensationalistic commercialism that passes for status quo.\"<ref name=\"Starstruck review\">Richard Caldwell. \"[http://thelotteryparty.com/starstruck/ Starstruck review\"]\". The Lottery Party, (Sept. 2, 2012).</ref>\n\n''Starstruck'' initially began its creative life as a stage play spoofing time-worn tropes of Science Fiction. Kaluta recalled his reaction to Lee's script: \"Oh God, I was amazed at how many genres she was actually poking fun at, without being a dyed-in-the-wool science fiction fan. She was poking fun at [[Andre Norton]], she was poking fun at everybody, all the [[E. E. Smith|Doc Smith]] stuff, without ever having read Doc Smith.\"<ref name=\"Steve Ringgenberg 1981 P.93\"/>\n\n===Absurdism===\n''Starstruck'' laces its drama and intrigue with bouts of surrealistic farce, ludicrous slapstick, absurd non-sequiters, random weirdness, cross-communication, cultural parody, and one-liners.\n\nThe writer clarified, \"Of course, it includes some social commentary  -people often comment on the feminism- but it's all comedy. I want people to enjoy it. People accept new ideas and commentary more readily if they're funny.\"<ref>Stephen Moloff. ''\"Stagestruck Starstruck\"''. Heavy Metal, #8311, (November 1983) P.46.</ref> Lee points to the feuding Bajar twins, Kalif and Lucrezia, whose sibling jealousy gets out of hand due to their wealth and power: \"In real life they probably would have just annoyed people in a bar; in comic books they blow people up.\"<ref>Peter Sanderson. ''\"Amazons, Anarchy, And Androids\"''. Amazing Heroes #57, (October 15, 1984) P.34.</ref> The writer saw absurdism as a philosophical antidote or survival perspective in the ''Starstruck'' universe, as well as in its creative process: \"We get real serious about showing the humanity of our characters, and at the same time, we feel that life is silly, and something that seems horribly embarrassing and horribly important is really silly at the same time.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/> Critic [[Robert Rodi]] wrote, \"Lee has reinvented Camp as a new sensibility; it isn't Camp in that it violates all known laws of drama and internal logic for the sake of flamboyance or effect. Rather, she's taken the space opera form and, while respecting the limitations of physics as we know them, pushed the genre's more baroque aspects to their absolute limits.\"<ref>Robert Rodi. \"Sexually Suspect: Rob Rodi on [[P. Craig Russell|Night Music]] and Starstruck\". The Comics Journal #111, (September 1986) P.52.</ref>\n\n===Archetypes===\nThe series takes gender-bending liberties with many iconic female and male roles of world history and popular culture. They include the [[Cowgirl#Cowgirls|Cowgirl]] (the Medea women on their space ranch); [[amazons]] (Galatia 9 and the Omegazon tribe who christened her); [[Bimbo]]/[[sex doll]]s (Erotica Ann and the 333 Annie pleasure droids; and the male droid, Handi Andy); [[valkyrie]]s (Brucilla The Muscle, the flying warrior whose uniform makes her resemble [[Brynhildr|Brunhilda]]); the [[The Faerie Queene|White Queen]] (Queen Glorianna, the tough revolutionary posing as a shining monarch) and the [[Queen (Snow White)|Black Queen]] (Verloona Ti, the devourer of little children); and [[Hardboiled|hardboiled detective]]s (Harry Palmer, the tough pug with a wounded heart).\n\n==Merchandise and collectibles==\n* '''Portfolio''': During the first run of the ''Starstruck'' stage play in 1980, Michael Kaluta illustrated character portraits of six of the main characters. Sal Quartuccio of S. Q. Productions published these as a limited edition portfolio of 2000; the 11\"x14\" prints were in black-and-white, sealed in an envelope which Kaluta signed and numbered.\n* '''T-shirts''': In 1985, Graphitti Designs sold two ''Starstruck'' T-shirts with original art by Kaluta. One profiled Erotica Ann, while the other spotlighted Erotica Ann and her lover, Harry Palmer, both with the ''Starstruck'' logo. These were offered for sale in the Epic Comics issues. In 1990, these shirt designs were amended with the ''Starstruck: The Expanding Universe'' logo, for sale in the Dark Horse issues.\n* '''Buttons''': Kaluta designed color lapel pins with individual characters for Graphitti Designs. Set 1 included Brucilla The Muscle, Galatia 9, Erotica Ann, Verloona Ti, E-V, and a faux Erotica Ann (Mary Medea). A second set with Eeeeeeeeeluh, Bronwyn of The Veil, Rah El Rex, and Kalif Bajar went unrealized.\n* '''Convention Poster''': In 1990, Kaluta did a poster for a comics convention in [[Grenoble]], France, depicting Galactic Girl Guides playing with hand puppets of the ''Starstruck'' cast. The poster was printed in large forms on walls and billboards around the city during the convention.\n* '''WonderCon Convention Program Book''': Also in 1990, Kaluta did a cover for the [[WonderCon]] 5 program book which depicted Galactic Girl Guides on a San Francisco cable car in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] being watched over by The Shadow.\n* '''Comic-Con Volunteer T-shirt''': Volunteers who help out on all four days of the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]] receive \"a rare and extremely limited Comic-Con volunteer t-shirt that is different each year- making the shirts instant collector's items.\"<ref>\"Comic-Con: 40 Years of Artists, Writers, fans, and Friends\", Chronicle Books, (2009) p.172.</ref> The souvenir T-shirt for the 1990 San Diego Comic-Con was a ''Starstruck'' shirt, printed with Kaluta's spoof of [[Dave Stevens]]'s ''[[The Rocketeer]]'' featuring Brucilla The Muscle.<ref>\"Comic-Con: 40 Years of Artists, Writers, fans, and Friends\", Chronicle Books, (2009) p.173.</ref>\n* '''Trading cards''': Two sets of trading cards covering Michael Kaluta's art career were released in the 1990s by publisher Michael Freidlander's imprint, FPG. Series 1 (90 cards, 1994) contained 12 ''Starstruck'' cards, and Series 2 (90 cards, 1995) contained 4 ''Starstruck'' cards. An additional set of cards called Metallic Storms printed on metallic foil contained one more ''Starstruck'' card.\n* '''''Starstruck'' script''': The script of the stage play, based on the revised 1983 production, was published in March 1985, and advertised in the Epic and Dark Horse issues.\n* '''Audioplay''': The first ''Starstruck'' audioplay adaption, based on the play, was released on CD and download from the AudioComics Company in October 2010. A second will become a free download in latter 2011.\n* '''2011 Merchandise''': In September 2011, The AudioComics Company offered new ''Starstruck'' merchandise for sale at its online store through [[Zazzle|Zazzle.com]], each using the art for the audioplay adaption: a new T-shirt, a coffee mug, and a customizable [[iPod Touch]] case. In October 2011, a separate line of new ''Starstruck'' merchandise based on the remastered IDW series was launched, also through an online store on [[Zazzle|Zazzle.com]]: ten different T-shirts in various cuts, which included Brucilla And The Galactic Girl Guides, the Tri-Clone Invasion badge, Galatia And Brucilla The Muscle, The United Federation of Female Freedom Fighters emblem, the villain Verloona with Kalif and Rex, the Skate The Mirror Mission Badge, the Droid Wars Mission Patch, Kalif and the Pleasure Droids, the Bajar twins on a playing card, and the AudioPlay cover art; a coffee mug starring the heroes and another mug for the villains; a poster print of the Vercadian Protector Droid with the Aguatunesian mer-people by Kaluta, and an Aquacade poster designed from Kaluta's original Portfolio portrait of the mermaid [[Mermaids in popular culture|Eeeeeeeeeeluh]] with an update by painter/graphic designer Lee Moyer.\n\n==Screen adaptations==\nIn 1980, Michael Kaluta told ''Future Life ''magazine, \"''Starstruck'' is a big bundle of potential. It has the potential for being a film, a play, a big-budget thing; who knows what.\"<ref>Susan Adamo. \"Feminist Fantasy\".'' Future Life Magazine'' #23, (December 1980) P.9.</ref>\n\nIn various interviews Lee and Kaluta have each spoken of different plans through the 1990s to continue ''Starstruck'' on film or television, consistently emphasizing retention of copyright ownership and creative control. Kaluta said in 1993, \"We own the characters, and we can do whatever we want with to do with them, but when you do what you want with them, the people you do it with will want to own them. Somebody will want to come in and fool with them.\"<ref>Robert J. Sodaro. \"A Conversation With Michael Wm. Kaluta and Joel Goss\", ''Dark Horse Comics Insider'' #30, (June 1994) P.45.</ref>\n\nIn 1990 through 1993, Kaluta worked on a project adapting the concept into movie form, but this came to naught; Kaluta noted in his career biography, \"For Limelight and Largo Entertainment: (1990 - 91) Character, setting, mood and toy prototypes for 'The Adventures of Brucilla the Muscle, ''Galactic Girl Guide''/Guard', sometimes called 'Maddie McPhee and the ''Galactic Girl Guides''' -- a movie spin off of (''Starstruck'')-- in development by Pet Fly Productions for [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]], October 1992.\"<ref>[http://www.kaluta.com/pages/bio/bio.html Kaluta timeline, 1991]</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Kaluta told a Spanish interviewer, \"As always, I am hoping some version of the Starstruck Comic Book will make its way to TV or Film.\"<ref>Armand Zoroa, NORMA Editorial magazine, 2000.</ref>\n\nLee has spoken of negotiations for a TV series circa 2003, where a network bought the option to turn ''Starstruck'' into a live action show in the spirit of [[Firefly (TV Series)|''Firefly'']] or ''[[Farscape]]''. \"I wrote (and was paid for) pitch documents, several scripts and I outlined a season of episodes for them. But when it finally came down to the deal, they asked us to renegotiate our contract, giving them much more control of the property than made us comfortable.

The Comics Journal #103, P.60, November 1985.</ref> The Epic Comics series won critical acclaim and a cult audience, but similar letters followed. Kaluta was proudest of one from an angry reader that took the creators to task for making him take longer than 15 minutes to read a comic. At the same time, the writer and artist realized they had a series that appealed to a growing segment in the mature market, but was being dismissed by the mainstream superhero audience. As a joke, Kaluta asked Epic to run an ad for Starstruck saying, \"Readers of The World, Unite! You Have Nothing to Use But Your Brains!\", an idea they enjoyed but passed on.<ref>Phil Trumbo. \"''Lurking In the Hearts Of Men''\". The Comics Journal #103, P.63, November 1985.</ref> Addressing their concern for the future of the series, Lee said, \"People have called this a cult book. I hope it's more than that. I hope people will bother to read it and go, 'This is different. Let me give it a try', rather than 'This is different. Let me throw it on the other side of the room from my [[X-Men]] comics'.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>  The Epic series was cancelled in 1986 after six issues, and in its wake within the same year, innovative series like ''[[Watchmen]]'', ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', and ''[[Maus]]'' earned acclaim and success for the mature qualities and sophisticated innovations that ''Starstruck'' was initially resisted for. In the wake of the cancellation, ''[[Comics Journal]]'' critic [[Robert Rodi]] wrote, \"That ''Starstruck'' should owe more to [[Gravity's Rainbow]] and [[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H*]] than to the [[The Galactus Trilogy|Galactus Trilogy]] means that many people who are exclusively comics-literate won't have the necessary aesthetic vocabulary to read it.

Because they weren't ready for it, right?

Pop culture critic David Allan Jones wrote of the republished series that it would be a challenge to new readers who would \"have to work a little to follow along, but believe me, it's worth it, especially if you enjoy experiencing the unique.

Comics media critic Paul Gravett called the collection \"a \"wondrous, ebullient SF epic and it all comes together in this delectable package.

Andrew Shephard of The New Inquiry wrote of the collection, \"''Starstruck'' could be both silly and smart, was progressive but unpretentious, and clever but not so impressed with itself that it ever forgot to entertain.

He fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] for three years, earning five medals, including an [[Iron Cross]]. Later in the war, he was transferred to the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], where he was captured by the [[British Army|British]] as the war drew to a close. One of only 90 of his original 1,000-man regiment to survive the war, he was transferred to a [[Prisoner of war|prisoner-of-war]] camp in [[Ashton-in-Makerfield]], Lancashire. Trautmann refused an offer of [[repatriation]], and following his release in 1948, settled in Lancashire, combining farm work with playing goalkeeper for a local football team, [[St Helens Town A.F.C.|St Helens Town]].\n\nPerformances for St Helens gained Trautmann a reputation as an outstanding goalkeeper, resulting in interest from [[The Football League|Football League]] clubs. In October 1949, he signed for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], a club playing in the country's highest level of football, the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. The club's decision to sign a former [[Axis powers|Axis]] paratrooper sparked protests and 20,000 people attended a demonstration. Over time, he gained acceptance through his performances in the City goal, playing in all but five of the club's next 250 matches.\n\nNamed [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] for 1956, Trautmann entered football folklore with his performance in the [[1956 FA Cup Final]]. With 17 minutes of the match remaining, Trautmann suffered a serious injury while diving at the feet of  [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]'s [[Peter Murphy (footballer, born 1922)|Peter Murphy]]. Despite his injury, he continued to play, making crucial saves to preserve his team's 3\u20131 lead. His neck was noticeably crooked as he collected his winner's medal; three days later an [[X-ray]] revealed it to be broken.\n\nTrautmann played for Manchester City until 1964, making 545 appearances. After his playing career, he moved into management, first with lower-division sides in England and Germany, and later as part of a [[German Football Association]] development scheme that took him to several countries, including Burma, Tanzania and Pakistan. In 2004, he was appointed an honorary [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) for promoting Anglo-German understanding through football. Trautmann died at home near [[Valencia]], Spain, on 19 July 2013, aged 89.\n\n==Early life in Germany==\n[[File:Bremen an der Schlachte 1922.jpg|thumb|right|Trautmann's birthplace, [[Bremen]], in the 1920s]]\nTrautmann was born on 22 October 1923 in Walle, a working class area in west [[Bremen]], living with his father, who worked in a fertiliser factory by the docks, and his mother Frieda.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 13.</ref> He had a brother, Karl-Heinz, three years his junior, with whom he enjoyed a close relationship.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 14.</ref> The bleak economic climate of the early 1930s forced the Trautmanns to sell their house and move to an apartment block in the working class area of Gr\u00f6pelingen, where Bernhard lived until 1941.\n\nThe young Bernhard had a keen interest in sport, playing football, [[Field handball|handball]] and ''v\u00f6lkerball'' (a form of [[dodgeball]]). To this end, he joined the [[YMCA]] and football club ''Blau und Weiss''.<ref>Blau und Weiss later became part of the Tura Bremen club, so some sources list Tura as the club he played for as a junior.</ref> He took to playing for the football club with enthusiasm, but the YMCA activities did not interest him to the same extent.\n\nIn August 1933, he joined a new organisation, the [[Deutsches Jungvolk|Jungvolk]], the junior section of the [[Hitler Youth]].<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 19.</ref> The following year, he won several local junior athletics events and was awarded a certificate for athletic excellence signed by [[Paul von Hindenburg]], the President of Germany.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 22.</ref> At the onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Trautmann was working as an apprentice [[Auto mechanic|motor mechanic]].<ref name=\"hof\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p. 134.</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nTrautmann joined the [[Luftwaffe]] as a radio operator in 1941. During training, he showed little aptitude for radio work, and transferred to [[Spandau]] to become a ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' ([[paratrooper]]).<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 38.</ref> He served first in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Occupied Poland]], though being stationed far behind the front line resulted in boredom for his regiment, which resorted to sports and practical jokes to pass the time. One such practical joke involving a car backfired on Trautmann, resulting in a [[staff sergeant]] burning his arms. Trautmann was [[court-martial]]led, and received a three-month prison sentence. At the start of his confinement, Trautmann came down with acute [[appendicitis]], and spent the remainder of his sentence in a [[military hospital]].<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', pp. 43\u201344.</ref>\n\nIn October 1941, he rejoined the [[35th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|35th Infantry Division]]{{cn|date=February 2019}} at [[Dnipropetrovsk|Dnepropetrovsk]], [[Ukraine]], where the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] advance had halted. Over-winter hit-and-run attacks on [[Soviet Army]] supply routes were the unit's main focus and in spring, Trautmann was promoted to ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' ([[corporal]]). Gains were made in 1942, but the Soviet counter-offensive hit Trautmann's unit hard, and by the time it was withdrawn from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], only 300 of the original 1,000 men remained.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 49.</ref> Trautmann won five medals for his actions on the Eastern Front, including an [[Iron Cross]] First Class.<ref name=\"hof\"/>\n\nPromoted to ''[[Feldwebel]]'' ([[sergeant]]), Trautmann was part of a unit formed from the remnants of several others that had been decimated in the east, and moved to France to guard against an expected [[Operation Overlord|Allied invasion of France]].

For goalkeepers of Trautmann's era, it was usual to kick the ball as far as possible downfield after making a save. By contrast, Trautmann, influenced by the Hungarian goalkeeper [[Gyula Grosics]], sought to start attacks by throwing the ball to a wing-half, typically [[Ken Barnes (footballer)|Ken Barnes]] or [[John McTavish (footballer, born 1932)|John McTavish]].

Though [[Bobby Johnstone]] equalised in the first half, they struggled in the second, and after 57&nbsp;minutes Trautmann was outwitted by [[Bobby Mitchell (footballer, born 1924)|Bobby Mitchell]], who scored Newcastle's second goal.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 168.</ref> The match finished as a 3\u20131 defeat for City, giving Trautmann a runners-up medal.\n\nManchester City had a strong season in [[1955\u201356 in English football|1955\u201356]], finishing fourth in the league and reached the FA Cup final against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. Trautmann, one of the team's most prominent performers, won the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] Award shortly before the match,<ref name=\"cr159\">James, ''Manchester City&nbsp;\u2013 The Complete Record'', p. 159.</ref> the first goalkeeper to win the award.

In the 75th minute, Trautmann, diving at an incoming ball, was knocked out in a collision with Birmingham's [[Peter Murphy (footballer, born 1922)|Peter Murphy]] in which he was hit in the neck by Murphy's right knee. No [[Substitute (association football)|substitutes]] were permitted in those days, so Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, carried on. For the remaining 15&nbsp;minutes he defended his net, making a crucial interception to deny Murphy once more. Manchester City held on for the victory, and Trautmann was the hero because of his spectacular saves in the last minutes of the match.

Trautmann met with the German national coach, [[Sepp Herberger]], in 1953, who explained that travel and political implications prevented him from selecting a player who was not readily available, and that he could only consider including Trautmann if he were playing in a German league.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 123.</ref> Consequently, Trautmann's international isolation prevented him from playing in the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]], in which his countrymen were victorious. Trautmann's only experience of international football came in 1960, when the Football League decided to include non-English players in the [[The Football League XI|Football League representative team]] for the first time. Trautmann captained the League against the Irish League, and also played against the Italian League.\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter a couple of months pondering his future career plans, he received a telephone call from the [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] chairman, Victor Bernard, who offered him the position of general manager. Stockport was a struggling lower league club with a small budget, and Trautmann's appointment was an attempt to improve its image. Many people in the local area supported one of the two Manchester clubs, so to stimulate interest Trautmann and Bernard decided to move matches to Friday evenings, when neither Manchester club would be playing.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 218.</ref> This improved revenue, but the team continued to struggle. Trautmann resigned in 1966 following a disagreement with Bernard.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 223.</ref> From 1967 to 1968, he was the manager of the German team [[SC Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster|Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster]], taking them to a 13th-place finish in the [[Regionalliga West (1963\u201374)|Regionalliga West]],<ref>{{cite web |language=German|url=http://www.fussballdaten.de/spieler/trautmannbernd/ |title=Bernd Trautmann |publisher=[[fussballdaten.de|Fussballdaten]] |accessdate=17 August 2008}}</ref> following which he had a short spell at [[SC Opel R\u00fcsselsheim|Opel R\u00fcsselsheim]].\n\nThe German Football Association then sent him as a development worker to countries without national football structures. His first posting was in [[Myanmar national football team|Myanmar (Burma)]], where he spent two years as the national coach, qualifying for the [[Football at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in 1972, and winning the President's Cup, a tournament contested by south-east Asian countries, later that year.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 234.</ref> His work subsequently took him to managing [[Tanzania national football team|Tanzania]], [[Liberia national football team|Liberia]], [[Pakistan national football team|Pakistan]] and [[North Yemen national football team|North Yemen]], until 1988, when he retired and settled in Spain.\n\n==Style of play==\nTrautmann excelled at shot-stopping, particularly penalties, saving 60% of those he faced over the course of his career. The [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] manager [[Matt Busby]] mentioned Trautmann's anticipation in his pre-match team talks: \"Don't stop to think where you're going to hit it with Trautmann. Hit it first and think afterwards. If you look up and work it out he will read your thoughts and stop it.\"<ref name=\"nfm\"/> Similar sentiments were expressed by the Manchester City forward [[Neil Young (footballer, born 1944)|Neil Young]], who recalled that \"the only way to beat him with a shot in training was to mis-hit it\".<ref>Penney, ''Manchester City: The Mercer-Allison Years'', p. 11.</ref> As a former handball player, Trautmann was adept at throwing the ball long distances, an attribute he used to start attacking moves,<ref name=\"ESPN\"/> particularly after witnessing the Hungarian goalkeeper [[Gyula Grosics]] use such tactics to good effect in Hungary's [[England 3\u20136 Hungary (1953 association football friendly)|6\u20133 victory over England]] in 1953.<ref name=\"T157\"/>\n\nTrautmann found it difficult to accept criticism, and allowed only close friends to suggest changes to his game. He occasionally dwelt on mistakes to the detriment of his concentration, a tendency his friend Stan Wilson called \"picking at daisies\".<ref name=\"T162\">Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 162.</ref> A short temper also caused occasional problems; he was sent off on more than one occasion.<ref name=\"T162\"/>\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n{{quote box|width=25%|fontsize=95%|quote=''There have only been two world-class goalkeepers.

Later in the war, he was transferred to the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], where he was captured by the [[British Army|British]] as the war drew to a close. One of only 90 of his original 1,000-man regiment to survive the war, he was transferred to a [[Prisoner of war|prisoner-of-war]] camp in [[Ashton-in-Makerfield]], Lancashire. Trautmann refused an offer of [[repatriation]], and following his release in 1948, settled in Lancashire, combining farm work with playing goalkeeper for a local football team, [[St Helens Town A.F.C.|St Helens Town]].\n\nPerformances for St Helens gained Trautmann a reputation as an outstanding goalkeeper, resulting in interest from [[The Football League|Football League]] clubs. In October 1949, he signed for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], a club playing in the country's highest level of football, the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. The club's decision to sign a former [[Axis powers|Axis]] paratrooper sparked protests and 20,000 people attended a demonstration. Over time, he gained acceptance through his performances in the City goal, playing in all but five of the club's next 250 matches.\n\nNamed [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] for 1956, Trautmann entered football folklore with his performance in the [[1956 FA Cup Final]]. With 17 minutes of the match remaining, Trautmann suffered a serious injury while diving at the feet of  [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]'s [[Peter Murphy (footballer, born 1922)|Peter Murphy]]. Despite his injury, he continued to play, making crucial saves to preserve his team's 3\u20131 lead. His neck was noticeably crooked as he collected his winner's medal; three days later an [[X-ray]] revealed it to be broken.\n\nTrautmann played for Manchester City until 1964, making 545 appearances. After his playing career, he moved into management, first with lower-division sides in England and Germany, and later as part of a [[German Football Association]] development scheme that took him to several countries, including Burma, Tanzania and Pakistan. In 2004, he was appointed an honorary [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) for promoting Anglo-German understanding through football. Trautmann died at home near [[Valencia]], Spain, on 19 July 2013, aged 89.\n\n==Early life in Germany==\n[[File:Bremen an der Schlachte 1922.jpg|thumb|right|Trautmann's birthplace, [[Bremen]], in the 1920s]]\nTrautmann was born on 22 October 1923 in Walle, a working class area in west [[Bremen]], living with his father, who worked in a fertiliser factory by the docks, and his mother Frieda.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 13.</ref> He had a brother, Karl-Heinz, three years his junior, with whom he enjoyed a close relationship.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 14.</ref> The bleak economic climate of the early 1930s forced the Trautmanns to sell their house and move to an apartment block in the working class area of Gr\u00f6pelingen, where Bernhard lived until 1941.\n\nThe young Bernhard had a keen interest in sport, playing football, [[Field handball|handball]] and ''v\u00f6lkerball'' (a form of [[dodgeball]]). To this end, he joined the [[YMCA]] and football club ''Blau und Weiss''.<ref>Blau und Weiss later became part of the Tura Bremen club, so some sources list Tura as the club he played for as a junior.</ref> He took to playing for the football club with enthusiasm, but the YMCA activities did not interest him to the same extent.\n\nIn August 1933, he joined a new organisation, the [[Deutsches Jungvolk|Jungvolk]], the junior section of the [[Hitler Youth]].<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 19.</ref> The following year, he won several local junior athletics events and was awarded a certificate for athletic excellence signed by [[Paul von Hindenburg]], the President of Germany.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 22.</ref> At the onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Trautmann was working as an apprentice [[Auto mechanic|motor mechanic]].<ref name=\"hof\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p. 134.</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nTrautmann joined the [[Luftwaffe]] as a radio operator in 1941. During training, he showed little aptitude for radio work, and transferred to [[Spandau]] to become a ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' ([[paratrooper]]).<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 38.</ref> He served first in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Occupied Poland]], though being stationed far behind the front line resulted in boredom for his regiment, which resorted to sports and practical jokes to pass the time. One such practical joke involving a car backfired on Trautmann, resulting in a [[staff sergeant]] burning his arms. Trautmann was [[court-martial]]led, and received a three-month prison sentence. At the start of his confinement, Trautmann came down with acute [[appendicitis]], and spent the remainder of his sentence in a [[military hospital]].<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', pp. 43\u201344.</ref>\n\nIn October 1941, he rejoined the [[35th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|35th Infantry Division]]{{cn|date=February 2019}} at [[Dnipropetrovsk|Dnepropetrovsk]], [[Ukraine]], where the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] advance had halted. Over-winter hit-and-run attacks on [[Soviet Army]] supply routes were the unit's main focus and in spring, Trautmann was promoted to ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' ([[corporal]]). Gains were made in 1942, but the Soviet counter-offensive hit Trautmann's unit hard, and by the time it was withdrawn from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], only 300 of the original 1,000 men remained.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 49.</ref> Trautmann won five medals for his actions on the Eastern Front, including an [[Iron Cross]] First Class.<ref name=\"hof\"/>\n\nPromoted to ''[[Feldwebel]]'' ([[sergeant]]), Trautmann was part of a unit formed from the remnants of several others that had been decimated in the east, and moved to France to guard against an expected [[Operation Overlord|Allied invasion of France]].

Trautmann resigned in 1966 following a disagreement with Bernard.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 223.</ref> From 1967 to 1968, he was the manager of the German team [[SC Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster|Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster]], taking them to a 13th-place finish in the [[Regionalliga West (1963\u201374)|Regionalliga West]],<ref>{{cite web |language=German|url=http://www.fussballdaten.de/spieler/trautmannbernd/ |title=Bernd Trautmann |publisher=[[fussballdaten.de|Fussballdaten]] |accessdate=17 August 2008}}</ref> following which he had a short spell at [[SC Opel R\u00fcsselsheim|Opel R\u00fcsselsheim]].\n\nThe German Football Association then sent him as a development worker to countries without national football structures. His first posting was in [[Myanmar national football team|Myanmar (Burma)]], where he spent two years as the national coach, qualifying for the [[Football at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in 1972, and winning the President's Cup, a tournament contested by south-east Asian countries, later that year.<ref>Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 234.</ref> His work subsequently took him to managing [[Tanzania national football team|Tanzania]], [[Liberia national football team|Liberia]], [[Pakistan national football team|Pakistan]] and [[North Yemen national football team|North Yemen]], until 1988, when he retired and settled in Spain.\n\n==Style of play==\nTrautmann excelled at shot-stopping, particularly penalties, saving 60% of those he faced over the course of his career. The [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] manager [[Matt Busby]] mentioned Trautmann's anticipation in his pre-match team talks: \"Don't stop to think where you're going to hit it with Trautmann. Hit it first and think afterwards. If you look up and work it out he will read your thoughts and stop it.\"<ref name=\"nfm\"/> Similar sentiments were expressed by the Manchester City forward [[Neil Young (footballer, born 1944)|Neil Young]], who recalled that \"the only way to beat him with a shot in training was to mis-hit it\".<ref>Penney, ''Manchester City: The Mercer-Allison Years'', p. 11.</ref> As a former handball player, Trautmann was adept at throwing the ball long distances, an attribute he used to start attacking moves,<ref name=\"ESPN\"/> particularly after witnessing the Hungarian goalkeeper [[Gyula Grosics]] use such tactics to good effect in Hungary's [[England 3\u20136 Hungary (1953 association football friendly)|6\u20133 victory over England]] in 1953.<ref name=\"T157\"/>\n\nTrautmann found it difficult to accept criticism, and allowed only close friends to suggest changes to his game. He occasionally dwelt on mistakes to the detriment of his concentration, a tendency his friend Stan Wilson called \"picking at daisies\".<ref name=\"T162\">Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 162.</ref> A short temper also caused occasional problems; he was sent off on more than one occasion.<ref name=\"T162\"/>\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n{{quote box|width=25%|fontsize=95%|quote=''There have only been two world-class goalkeepers. One was Lev Yashin, the other was the German boy who played in Manchester \u2013 Trautmann.''|source=\u2014[[Lev Yashin]]}}\nOver the course of his career, Trautmann received many plaudits from leading football figures. The Russian goalkeeper [[Lev Yashin]], himself considered one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, believed that Trautmann and himself were the \"only ... two world-class goalkeepers\".<ref name=\"ESPN\"/>\n\nTrautmann's idiosyncratic style of play also had an influence on budding young goalkeepers at the height of his career.

The latest version of the software is Dewesoft X3, released in October 2017.\n\n{{Infobox software\n| name = Dewesoft X\n| logo = <!-- Image name is enough. -->\n| logo alt = \n| logo caption = \n| screenshot = <!-- Image name is enough. -->\n| screenshot size =\n| screenshot alt = \n| caption = \n| collapsible = <!-- Any text here will collapse the screenshot. -->\n| author = \n| developer = Dewesoft d.o.o.\n| released = {{Start date and age|2001|df=yes}}\n| discontinued = <!-- Set to yes if software is discontinued, otherwise omit. -->\n| ver layout = <!-- simple (default) or stacked -->\n| latest release version = Dewesoft X3 SP11\n| latest release date = {{Start date and age|2020|03|df=yes}}\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| repo = <!-- {{URL|example.org}} -->\n| programming language = Delphi, C++\n| engine = <!-- or engines -->\n| operating system = Windows 7 or later\n| platform = x86-64\n| included with = \n| size = \n| language = \n| language count = <!-- Number only -->\n| language footnote = \n| genre = \nData acquisition, instrument control, test automation, analysis and signal processing, industrial control\n| license = Proprietary\n| alexa = \n| website = {{URL|https://dewesoft.com/products/daq-software/dewesoft-x/}}\n| standard = \n| AsOf = \n}}\n\n== Version history ==\n\nThe first version of the software is Dewesoft 5.0, released in 2001 and patented in 2002 at the USA and EU patent office for the capability of synchronized presentation of all acquired and mathematically transformed signals on a personal computer (PC). \n\nIn 2003 Dewesoft 6.0 was released, adding essential features suited for automotive, telemetry and power measurements and power analysis.\n\nDewesoft 7.0 data acquisition software was launched in 2008 with a completely overhauled graphical user interface and new capabilities.\n\nThe company changed the software\u2019s naming convention with the release of Dewesoft X in 2012. With this version of the software, Dewesoft for the first time completely abandoned support for 3rd party analog DAQ hardware and exclusively supported Dewesoft DAQ hardware. It was also no longer commercially available but was instead given to customers free of charge as an application for acquired data acquisition hardware with lifetime free upgrades.\n\nDewesoft X2 was released in 2015 and brought significant performance improvements, with calculations being executed up to 4 times faster and graphics being drawn up to 10 times faster than in Dewesoft X, due to them being executed in parallel. \n\nIn 2017 Dewesoft X3 was officially launched with its main improvement being the availability in a 64-bit version. As of February 2019, Dewesoft X3 SP10 is the latest stable build of Dewesoft X3.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name-version!! Date\n|-\n| Dewesoft 5.0 || 2001\n|-\n| Dewesoft 6.0 || 2003\n|-\n| Dewesoft 7.0 || 2008\n|-\n| Dewesoft X || 2012\n|-\n| Dewesoft X2 || 2015\n|-\n| Dewesoft X3 || 2017\n|}\n\n=== Available versions ===\n\nDewesoft X3 is always available in three versions, release, release candidate and development as part of a branching strategy to clear as many bugs as possible before deploying the software in critical operations. \n\nThe release cycle usually lasts about 2 to 3 months, after which point the versions get shifted, the release candidate branch becomes the new release branch, the development branch becomes the new release candidate branch and a new development branch is created.\n\nThe roles of the branches are as follows:\n\n*Release: the release branch is the most recent stable release version which should be used for real measurements. The version itself does not change unless a critical issue is discovered in it, at which point a patch of the release branch is released. \n\n*Release candidate: the release candidate branch contains the fixes for bugs that have been discovered in the release branch, but are not critical to the measurement process. It is updated regularly and will sometimes also include minor features.\n\n*Development: all bug fixes from the release candidate branch are also applied to the development branch, which is mostly used for adding new features. This means that all new functionality passes through an approximately 4-month long release cycle that helps discover and remove issues before deployment.\n\n[[File:X3 screen.png| thumb |Sreenshot of Dewesoft X3]]\n\n== Functionality ==\n\nDewesoft\u2019s primary objective is to be a one software solution for all applications. The current scope of functionality covers a wide range of automotive, power analysis, NVH, aerospace, industrial and civil engineering applications. At the same time, the software needs to be as easy to use as possible, allowing users to set up and perform simple measurements in a short time.\n\nThe key that allows Dewesoft to execute both effectively is that it is channel based with a modular infrastructure. All data that comes into the software (via Dewesoft hardware or otherwise) becomes a Dewesoft channel and is treated as such. Channels have basic properties (name, color, unit), can be scaled, visualized, used in other modules (statistics, filters, FFT) or exported. \n\nThe modular infrastructure means that users only see the core applications of the software, while other, more application specific parts are hidden and can be added at any time. The modules usually get data using channel inputs and they produce new channels as results. For example, the Power analysis module takes voltage and current channel as inputs and produces the calculated power, energy and THD channels.\n\n=== General functionality ===\n\nThe functions described below are available to all users of Dewesoft hardware without additional licensing costs (see Licensing policy).\n\n==== Data recording ====\n\nDewesoft X software is unique in terms of supported interfaces. No other data acquisition software can match a number of supported interfaces that can be acquired fully synchronized, stored and visualized in the same data file. Supported interfaces include:\n\n*Analog data: IEPE/ICP, Charge, Strain, Stress, LVDT, Voltage, Current Resistance, Thermocouple, RTD\n*Digital, counter and encoder\n*Video DirectX video cameras, high-speed video cameras, IR thermal video cameras\n*Navigational GPS/GNSS and Inertial Navigation\n*Vehicle bus systems: CAN bus, OBDII on CAN, CAN FD, J1939 and J1587, XCP, CCP, LIN bus, FlexRay, Kistler KiRoad, MTS road simulator integration, Testbed AK-protocol support, *ETAS INCA over CAN, SENT (SAE J2716)\n*Aerospace interfaces: IRIG-108 CHAPTER 10, IRIG CHAPTER 4, ARINC 429, MIL-STD-1553\n*Industrial bus systems: Siemens S7, Modbus, OPC-UA, EtherCAT\n\n==== Mathematics ====\n\nDewesoft comes standard with a wide range of mathematical functions:\n\n*Formula\n*IIR filter\n*FIR filter\n*Frequency domain filter\n*Basic statistics\n*Array statistics\n*ClassificationTime reference curve\n*XY reference\n*Frequency domain reference curve\n*Vector reference\n*Integral derivative\n*Latch value math\n*Scope\n*Delay channel\n*Time-to-vector transformExact frequency\n*Correlation\n*Cepstrum\n*Full spectrum\n*Frequency integration and derivation\n*FFT\n*Short-time Fourier transform\n*Octave analysis\n*Angle sensor math\n*Envelope detection\n*Counting\n*Weighting filters\n*PID control\n*Strain rosette\n*PCB Strain rate\n*Vector matrix constant\n*Scaling\n\nAll of the above listed functions are modular and take inputs in the form of channels, simply by selecting them either from a drop-down menu or ticking a checkbox. This allows users to set up the same mathematical operations on a lot of channels very quickly, for example calculating the average value of every 5 seconds or applying an additional software FIR filter. In both cases, no programming or visual sequencing is required.\n\n==== Visualization ====\n\nVisualization of data in Dewesoft is done using so called graphical widgets, which users can drag and drop to the screen and arrange them in any way they choose. Each widget is different visually and it can only accept channels of certain types. For example, a digital meter can only display scalar channels while a 2D plot can only display array (vector or matrix) channels.\n\nDewesoft\u2019s library contains the following widgets:\n\n*Digital meter\n*Recorder\n*Vector scope\n*Horizontal/vertical bar graph\n*Vertical recorder\n*X-Y recorder\n*Video\n*Analog meter\n*Scope\n*Map\n*Indicator lamp\n*Overload indicator\n*2D graph\n*Tabular display\n*3D graph\n*Orbit plot\n*Control element\n*Discrete display\n*2D/3D Table\n\n==== Data analysis ====\n\nBecause Dewesoft is able to perform calculations during the recording of the data, this means that some sort of data analysis can already be performed online. A very useful feature to help with this is the so called \u201cFreeze mode\u201d, which allows users to look at all of the data that has already been recorded while the measurement is still in progress. \n\nIn offline analysis, Dewesoft displays the whole measurement timeline but allows users to use cursors on the recorder instrument (or the +- buttons) to zoom in to sections where they want to study the data more closely.\n\nDue to high sampling, users are often dealing with data files that have file sizes in the GB range. To enable smooth operation, Dewesoft stores data in layers (buffers), meaning that Dewesoft will not only store the raw data, but also Min/Max/Avg/Rms values for each channel at a few longer intervals. When opening data files, Dewesoft will only load display the most appropriate reduced buffer, therefore saving a lot of time not having to go through all of the data, allowing fast data loading times. If the user zooms deep within a section of the file, he will move through the different buffers and finally see the actual samples of each channel. \n\n==== Reporting ====\n\nAs Dewesoft is primarily a data acquisition software, it wants to allow users the flexibility of being able to analyze the data in other software. With that in mind, Dewesoft offers a variety of export formats compatible with popular analysis tools. Users are free to configure which channels they want to export and at which rates. When exporting to different rates from the ones that the data was stored with, Dewesoft has a resampling functionality to prevent aliasing.\n\nData can be exported to the following formats:\n\n*FlexPro [*.fpd]\n*Microsoft Excel [*.xls]\n*DIAdem [*.dat]\n*Matlab [*.mat]\n*Universal file format 58 [*.unv]\n*FAMOS [*.dat]\n*NSoft time series [*.dac]\n*Text File [*.txt]\n*Sony [*.log]\n*RPCIII [*.rsp]\n*Comtrade [*.cfg]\n*Technical data management [*.tdm]\n*JSON [*.json]\n*ASAM MDF4 [*.mf4]\n*S3 [*.s3t]\n*ATI [*.ati]\n*HDF5 [*.h5]\n*DynaWorks neutral file [*.nt]\n*Standard data file (SDF) [*.dat/sdf]\n*WFT [*.wft]\n*Replay [*.rpl]\n*Wave [*.wav]\n*Google earth [*.kml]\n*BWF [*.dat]\n\nTo create advanced reports, users can take advantage of using Dewesoft in combination with Excel or FlexPro templates, printing the measurement screen as a PDF or exporting it as a video file.\n\n==== Sequencing ====\n\nThe sequencer is a visual programming tool within Dewesoft that can be used for test automation. It is basically a block diagram where the users can drag & drop and connect blocks which perform certain actions, therefore constructing a sequence of events. In cases where measurements are done in a repetitive manner and perhaps require user interaction in a predetermined way, the sequencer is very handy. \n\nThe sequencer can load setup files, put Dewesoft in measure mode, store data, switch between displays, wait for values or user interaction, export data or print reports. It works in conjunction with setup files, which are still used to prepare the test configuration.\n\n=== Application specific functionality ===\n\nWhile Dewesoft\u2019s primary focus is data acquisition, the software is also very capable in data analysis. As not every user requires every analysis option, these modules are usually offered at an additional cost as sort of a convenience feature for not having to manually enter all of the calculations using the formula tool. For example Deweosoft power analysis module offers a convenient way of selecting voltage and current data and will produce results based on the user\u2019s wishes by ticking a few checkboxes. \n\nDewesot offers solutions in the following areas:\n\n==== Power/Energy analysis\t ====\n*Power Analyzer\n*Power Quality Analyzer\n*Wind & Solar testing\n*Electrical Grid & Power System testing\n*E-mobility\n==== Vehicle Testing\t ====\n*Road Load Data analysis\n*Durability test bed integration\n*Brake testing\n*Brake Noise testing\n*Polygon and GPS solutions\n*ADAS testing\n*Vehicle Dynamics\n*Combustion Analysis\n*Harsh Environment testing\n*Crash Test\n*Fatigue\n==== Vibration analysis\t ====\n*FFT analyser\n*Order tracking\n*Rotational and Torsional Vibrations\n*Balancing\n*Orbital Analysis\n*Shock Response Spectrum\n*Bearing Envelope detection\n*Modal Analysis\n*Sine Processing \n*Human Body Vibrations\n==== Acoustic analysis ====\n*Octave Analyzer\n*Sound Level Meter\n*Sound Power\n*Sound Intensity\n*Sound Quality\n*Reverberation\n*Pass-by Noise\n==== Monitoring\t ====\n*Cloud solutions\n*Machine condition monitoring\n*Structural monitoring\n==== Automation/control ====\n*Real time control frontend\n==== Telemetry ====\n*IRIG chapter 4 PCM\n*IRIG Chapter 10/iNET\n\n=== Developers ===\n\nDevelopers are able to extend Dewesoft\u2019s functionality or use some of its functions in an application of their own using several different intercas described below.\n\n==== Extending Dewesoft ====\n\nDewesoft software offers so-called plug-in technology which can be used to extend the software in several ways:\nUse the C++ script to simplify complicated formulas and create custom math modules\nUse custom plugins to add support for third-party devices, protocols or implement special math processing routines inside Dewesoft with a custom GUI\nCreate custom visual controls and displays to visualize data the way you want\nCreate custom data export functions to export data into any file format\n\nIn the past, software extension was only possible with plugins written in Delphi but Dewesoft has moved to C++ which is more commonly used compared to Delphi. The same plugin interface is also used internally by Dewesoft developers.\n\nA key functionality that became available in 2018 is the C++ Script, which allows users to write code within Dewesoft and compile it directly within the UI, without external editors. This makes it very convenient and efficient for small tasks and makes the tool especially attractive to engineers who aren\u2019t programmers by trait.\n\n==== Automation or embedding Dewesoft ====\n\nDewesoft can be used as a backend to a different program by using the following functionalities:\n\nUsing the DCOM interface the Dewesoft X software can be controlled by an external application\nDewesoft NET is able to send and receive data as well as commands over the TCP/IP protocol\nThe DWDataReader API can be used to implement support for reading Dewesoft\u2019s data file format in any data analysis tool\nBoth DCOM and NET allow custom applications to control Dewesoft to some extent and gather its data online while the DWDataReader API gives programmers access to Dewesoft\u2019s proprietary file structure. \n\n== Licensing policy ==\n\nThe software can be downloaded directly from Dewesoft\u2019s webpage and used without a license in simulation mode. A license is only required when acquiring and storing data from a physical device. Dewesoft provides a complimentary Professional license with the purchase of any Dewesoft instrument, which unlocks a broad functionality set within the software, ranging from standard mathematical analysis, visualization, sequencing and exporting data to a multitude of formats. All of the functionality is specified in Dewesoft\u2019s feature matrix. The license itself is embedded in the instrument, allowing it to be used on any PC without the need to manually transfer a license file or key.\n\nDewesoft X is completely free in analysis mode. This means once a user has stored the data he can move it to any PC, where it can be opened and analyzed without a license by a different user.\n\nDewesoft licenses do not expire and guarantee free future upgrades. Therefore, a user who purchased a Dewesoft license during the time of Dewesoft 7.0 can still use the same license with the currently released Dewesoft X3.\n\n=== Bundles, options ===\n\nDewesoft offers additional, application or protocol-specific modules that can be purchased on top of the Professional license as a one time fee. These modules are typically used for detailed analysis in a certain application (Rotor Balancer, Brake Noise, Sound Quality) or provide the means to acquire and store data from a third-party device or protocol (Ethernet Receiver, OxTS, SerialCom).\n \nOptions that are often used together as part of overarching applications are also grouped together as bundles and offered at discounted prices. For example, the Rotating Machinery Analyzer bundle includes the following options: FFT analyzer (advanced), Order tracking, Rotational and torsional vibration, Rotor balancer.\n\nIn order for users to test the purchasable functionalities on actual data, Dewesoft offers an evaluation license that unlocks the software completely for the duration of 30 days. The evaluation license can be requested using the following form.\n\n[[Category:Data analysis software]]\n[[Category:C++ software]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Notability|Products|date=April 2020}}\n{{Advert|date=April 2020}}\n{{COI|date=April 2020}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=April 2020}}\n}}\nDewesoft X is a software tool developed by Dewesoft d.o.o. with a primary focus on data recording and data analysis.

For example Deweosoft power analysis module offers a convenient way of selecting voltage and current data and will produce results based on the user\u2019s wishes by ticking a few checkboxes. \n\nDewesot offers solutions in the following areas:\n\n==== Power/Energy analysis\t ====\n*Power Analyzer\n*Power Quality Analyzer\n*Wind & Solar testing\n*Electrical Grid & Power System testing\n*E-mobility\n==== Vehicle Testing\t ====\n*Road Load Data analysis\n*Durability test bed integration\n*Brake testing\n*Brake Noise testing\n*Polygon and GPS solutions\n*ADAS testing\n*Vehicle Dynamics\n*Combustion Analysis\n*Harsh Environment testing\n*Crash Test\n*Fatigue\n==== Vibration analysis\t ====\n*FFT analyser\n*Order tracking\n*Rotational and Torsional Vibrations\n*Balancing\n*Orbital Analysis\n*Shock Response Spectrum\n*Bearing Envelope detection\n*Modal Analysis\n*Sine Processing \n*Human Body Vibrations\n==== Acoustic analysis ====\n*Octave Analyzer\n*Sound Level Meter\n*Sound Power\n*Sound Intensity\n*Sound Quality\n*Reverberation\n*Pass-by Noise\n==== Monitoring\t ====\n*Cloud solutions\n*Machine condition monitoring\n*Structural monitoring\n==== Automation/control ====\n*Real time control frontend\n==== Telemetry ====\n*IRIG chapter 4 PCM\n*IRIG Chapter 10/iNET\n\n=== Developers ===\n\nDevelopers are able to extend Dewesoft\u2019s functionality or use some of its functions in an application of their own using several different intercas described below.\n\n==== Extending Dewesoft ====\n\nDewesoft software offers so-called plug-in technology which can be used to extend the software in several ways:\nUse the C++ script to simplify complicated formulas and create custom math modules\nUse custom plugins to add support for third-party devices, protocols or implement special math processing routines inside Dewesoft with a custom GUI\nCreate custom visual controls and displays to visualize data the way you want\nCreate custom data export functions to export data into any file format\n\nIn the past, software extension was only possible with plugins written in Delphi but Dewesoft has moved to C++ which is more commonly used compared to Delphi. The same plugin interface is also used internally by Dewesoft developers.\n\nA key functionality that became available in 2018 is the C++ Script, which allows users to write code within Dewesoft and compile it directly within the UI, without external editors. This makes it very convenient and efficient for small tasks and makes the tool especially attractive to engineers who aren\u2019t programmers by trait.\n\n==== Automation or embedding Dewesoft ====\n\nDewesoft can be used as a backend to a different program by using the following functionalities:\n\nUsing the DCOM interface the Dewesoft X software can be controlled by an external application\nDewesoft NET is able to send and receive data as well as commands over the TCP/IP protocol\nThe DWDataReader API can be used to implement support for reading Dewesoft\u2019s data file format in any data analysis tool\nBoth DCOM and NET allow custom applications to control Dewesoft to some extent and gather its data online while the DWDataReader API gives programmers access to Dewesoft\u2019s proprietary file structure. \n\n== Licensing policy ==\n\nThe software can be downloaded directly from Dewesoft\u2019s webpage and used without a license in simulation mode. A license is only required when acquiring and storing data from a physical device. Dewesoft provides a complimentary Professional license with the purchase of any Dewesoft instrument, which unlocks a broad functionality set within the software, ranging from standard mathematical analysis, visualization, sequencing and exporting data to a multitude of formats. All of the functionality is specified in Dewesoft\u2019s feature matrix. The license itself is embedded in the instrument, allowing it to be used on any PC without the need to manually transfer a license file or key.\n\nDewesoft X is completely free in analysis mode. This means once a user has stored the data he can move it to any PC, where it can be opened and analyzed without a license by a different user.\n\nDewesoft licenses do not expire and guarantee free future upgrades. Therefore, a user who purchased a Dewesoft license during the time of Dewesoft 7.0 can still use the same license with the currently released Dewesoft X3.\n\n=== Bundles, options ===\n\nDewesoft offers additional, application or protocol-specific modules that can be purchased on top of the Professional license as a one time fee. These modules are typically used for detailed analysis in a certain application (Rotor Balancer, Brake Noise, Sound Quality) or provide the means to acquire and store data from a third-party device or protocol (Ethernet Receiver, OxTS, SerialCom).\n \nOptions that are often used together as part of overarching applications are also grouped together as bundles and offered at discounted prices. For example, the Rotating Machinery Analyzer bundle includes the following options: FFT analyzer (advanced), Order tracking, Rotational and torsional vibration, Rotor balancer.\n\nIn order for users to test the purchasable functionalities on actual data, Dewesoft offers an evaluation license that unlocks the software completely for the duration of 30 days. The evaluation license can be requested using the following form.\n\n[[Category:Data analysis software]]\n[[Category:C++ software]]\n", "name_user": "MarginalCost", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(+Category:Data analysis software; +Category:C++ softwareusingHotCat)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewesoft_X_Software"}

Outbreaks of another mosquito-transmitted disease, Australian encephalitis ([[Murray Valley encephalitis virus|Murray Valley encephalitis]]\u2014MVE), occur in temperate south-east Australia after heavy rainfall and flooding, which are associated with La Ni\u00f1a events. A severe outbreak of Rift Valley fever occurred after extreme rainfall in north-eastern Kenya and southern Somalia during the 1997\u201398 El Ni\u00f1o.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allcountries.org/health/el_nino_and_its_health_impact.html |title=El Ni\u00f1o and its health impact |work=Health Topics A to Z |access-date=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nENSO conditions have also been related to [[Kawasaki disease]] incidence in Japan and the west coast of the United States,<ref name=Ballester>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/grl.50388| volume = 40 |last1=Ballester |first1=Joan |author2=Jane C.

While some nocturnal primates (western tarsiers Tarsius bancanus and slow loris Nycticebus coucang) and the Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) were locally extirpate or suffered drastic reduction in numbers within these burned forests. Lepidoptera outbreaks were documented in Panam\u00e1 and Costa Rica. During the 1982\u201383, 1997-98 and 2015-16 ENSO events, large extensions of tropical forests experienced a prolonged dry period that resulted in widespread fires, and drastic changes in forest structure and tree species composition in Amazonian and Bornean forests. But Their impacts do not restrict only vegetation, since declines in insect populations were observed after extreme drought and terrible fires during El Ni\u00f1o 2015-16 <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fran\u00e7a|first=Filipe|last2=Ferreira|first2=J| last3=Vaz-de-Mello|first3=FZ| last4=Maia|first4=LF| last5=Berenguer|first5=E| last6=Palmeira|first6=A| last7=Fadini|first7=R| last8=Louzada|first8=J| last9=Braga|first9=R| last10=Oliveira|first10=VH| last11=Barlow|first11=J| date=10 February 2020|title= El Ni\u00f1o impacts on human\u2010modified tropical forests: Consequences for dung beetle diversity and associated ecological processes |journal=Biotropica |volume=52 | issue = 1 |pages=1\u201311|doi=10.1111/btp.12756}}</ref>. Declines in habitat-specialist and disturbance-sensitive bird species and in large-frugivorous mammals were also observed in Amazonian burned forests, while temporary extirpation of more than 100 lowland butterfly species occurred at a burned forest site in Borneo. \n\nMost critically, global mass bleaching events were recorded in 1997-98 and 2015\u201316, when around 75-99% losses of live coral were registered across the word. Considerable attention was also given to the collapse of Peruvian and Chilean anchovy populations that leaded to a severe fishery crisis following the ENSO events in 1972\u201373, 1982\u201383, 1997-98 and, more recently, in 2015\u201316. In particular, increased surface seawater temperatures in 1982-83 also lead to the probable extinction of two hydrocoral species in Panam\u00e1, and to a massive mortality of kelp beds along 600 km of coastline in Chile, from which kelps and associated biodiversity slowly recovered in the most affected areas even after 20 years.
