Such works pointed to alternative interfaces and questioned the dominant role of search engines in controlling access to the net.\n\nNevertheless, the Internet is not reducible to the web, nor to search engines. Besides these [[unicast]] (point to point) applications, suggesting that there is some reference points, there is also a [[multicast]] (multipoint and uncentered) internet that has been explored by very few artistic experiences, such as the [[Poietic Generator]]. Internet art has, according to Juliff and Cox, suffered under the privileging of the user interface inherent within computer art. They argue that Internet is not synonymous with a specific user and specific interface, but rather a dynamic structure that encompasses coding and the artist's intention.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Toby Juliff|first1=Travis Cox|title=The post-display condition of contemporary computer art|journal=eMaj|date=2015|volume=8|url=https://emajartjournal.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cox-and-juliff_the-post-display-condition-of-contemporary-computer-art.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of social networking platforms, understood to be \"web-based services that allow individuals to... construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system... articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and... view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system\",<ref name=\"Boyd\">{{Cite journal\n | last = Boyd\n | first = D.

Such works pointed to alternative interfaces and questioned the dominant role of search engines in controlling access to the net.\n\nNevertheless, the Internet is not reducible to the web, nor to search engines. Besides these [[unicast]] (point to point) applications, suggesting that there is some reference points, there is also a [[multicast]] (multipoint and uncentered) internet that has been explored by very few artistic experiences, such as the [[Poietic Generator]]. Internet art has, according to Juliff and Cox, suffered under the privileging of the user interface inherent within computer art. They argue that Internet is not synonymous with a specific user and specific interface, but rather a dynamic structure that encompasses coding and the artist's intention.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Toby Juliff|first1=Travis Cox|title=The post-display condition of contemporary computer art|journal=eMaj|date=2015|volume=8|url=https://emajartjournal.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cox-and-juliff_the-post-display-condition-of-contemporary-computer-art.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of social networking platforms, understood to be \"web-based services that allow individuals to... construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system... articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and... view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system\",<ref name=\"Boyd\">{{Cite journal\n | last = Boyd\n | first = D.

Some employees are also concerned about privacy. Even if they do not provide their names when responding to a company survey, can they be certain that their anonymity is protected? Such fears prevent some employees from expressing an opinion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schultz & Schultz|first=Duane|title=Psychology and work today|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|isbn=978-0-205-68358-1|pages=40}}</ref>\n\n====Advantages of online surveys====\n* Web surveys are faster, simpler, and cheaper.<ref name=\"Bethlehem 2012\" /> However, lower costs are not so straightforward in practice, as they are strongly interconnected to errors.

The difference between probability samples (where the inclusion probabilities for all units of the target population is known in advance) and non-probability samples (which often require less time and effort but generally do not support statistical inference) is crucial. Probability samples are highly affected by problems of non-coverage (not all members of the general population have Internet access) and frame problems (online survey invitations are most conveniently distributed using e-mail, but there are no e-mail directories of the general population that might be used as a sampling frame). Because coverage and frame problems can significantly impact data quality, they should be adequately reported when disseminating the research results.<ref name=\"Vehovar 2008\" /><ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Kevin|title=Researching Internet-Based Populations: Advantages and Disadvantages of Online Survey Research, Online Questionnaire Authoring Software Packages, and Web Survey Services|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=1 April 2005|volume=10|issue=3|pages=1034|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/3/JCMC1034/4614509|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n* '''Invitations''' to online surveys. Due to the lack of sampling frames many online survey invitations are published in the form of an URL link on web sites or in other media, which leads to sample selection bias that is out of research control and to non-probability samples. Traditional solicitation modes, such as telephone or mail invitations to web surveys, can help overcoming probability sampling issues in online surveys. However, such approaches are faced with problems of dramatically higher costs and questionable effectiveness.<ref name=\"Vehovar 2008\" />\n* '''[[Response rate (survey)|Non-response]]'''. Online survey response rates are generally low and also vary extremely \u2013 from less than 1% in enterprise surveys with e-mail invitations to almost 100% in specific membership surveys. In addition to refusing participation, terminating surveying during the process or not answering certain questions, several other non-response patterns can be observed in online surveys, such as lurking respondents and a combination of partial and item non-response.  Response rates can be increased by offering monetary or some other type of incentive to the respondents, by contacting respondents several times (follow-up), and by keeping the questionnaire difficulty as low as possible.<ref name=\"Vehovar 2008\" />  There are draw-backs to using an incentive to garner a response.  Non-bias responses could be questioned in this type of situation.  The most concrete way to gain feedback is to publicize what is done with the results.  To take concrete actions based on feedback and to show that to the customer base is extremely motivating to customers to continue to let their voice be heard.   \n* '''Acquiescence bias'''. Due to a phenomenon inherently present in human nature, many people have acquiescent personalities and are more likely to agree with statements than disagree - regardless of the content. Often, those people see the question-asker as an expert in their field which causes them to be more likely to react positively to the question asked. That being said, acquiescence bias (also known as the friendliness bias or \u201cyea-saying\u201d) manifests itself when a respondent shows a tendency to agree with whatever it is that you are asking or stating, even though they might not actually agree.<ref>Jovancic, Nemanja.

Retrieved March 16, 2020.</ref>\n* '''Platform Issues'''. Lack of familiarity with the platform used can cause participants and clients confusion.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n* '''Questionnaire design'''. While modern web questionnaires offer a range of design features (different question types, images, multimedia), the use of such elements should be limited to the extent necessary for respondents to understand questions or to stimulate the response. It should not affect their responses, because that would mean lower validity and reliability of data. Appropriate questionnaire design can help lowering the measurement error that can arise also due to the respondents or the survey mode itself (respondent\u2019s motivation, computer literacy, abilities, privacy concerns, etc.).<ref name=\"Vehovar 2008\" />\n* '''Post-survey adjustments'''. Various robust procedures have been developed for situations where sampling deviate from probability selection, or, when we face non-coverage and non-response problems. The standard statistical inference procedures (e.g. confidence interval calculations and hypothesis testing) still require a probability sample. The actual survey practice, particularly in marketing research and in public opinion polling, which massively neglects the principles of probability samples, increasingly requires from the statistical profession to specify the conditions where non-probability samples may work.<ref name=\"Vehovar 2008\" />\n\nThese issues, and potential remedies, are discussed in a number of sources.<ref>Salant, Priscilla, and Don A.

Such fears prevent some employees from expressing an opinion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schultz & Schultz|first=Duane|title=Psychology and work today|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|isbn=978-0-205-68358-1|pages=40}}</ref>\n\n====Advantages of online surveys====\n* Web surveys are faster, simpler, and cheaper.<ref name=\"Bethlehem 2012\" /> However, lower costs are not so straightforward in practice, as they are strongly interconnected to errors. Because response rate comparisons to other survey modes are usually not favourable for online surveys, efforts to achieve a higher response rate (e.g., with traditional solicitation methods) may substantially increase costs.<ref name=\"Vehovar 2008\" />\n* The entire data collection period is significantly shortened, as all data can be collected and processed in little more than a month.<ref name=\"Bethlehem 2012\" />\n* Interaction between the respondent and the questionnaire is more dynamic compared to e-mail or paper surveys.<ref name=\"Dillman 2006\">\n{{cite book\n  |last=Dillman|first=D.A.\n  |year=2006\n  |title=Mail and Internet Surveys: The Tailored Design Method\n  |edition=2nd\n  |location=New Jersey|publisher=John Wiley & Sons\n  |isbn=978-0-470-03856-7\n}}</ref> Online surveys are also less intrusive, and they suffer less from social desirability effects.<ref name=\"Bethlehem 2012\" />\n* Complex skip patterns can be implemented in ways that are mostly invisible to the respondent.<ref name=\"Dillman 2006\" />\n* Pop-up instructions can be provided for individual questions to provide help with questions exactly where assistance is required.<ref name=\"Dillman 2006\" />\n* Questions with long lists of answer choices can be used to provide immediate coding of answers to certain questions that are usually asked in an open-ended fashion in paper questionnaires.<ref name=\"Dillman 2006\" />\n* Online surveys can be tailored to the situation (e.g., respondents may be allowed save a partially completed form, the questionnaire may be preloaded with already available information, etc.).<ref name=\"Bethlehem 2012\" />\n* Online questionnaires may be improved by applying usability testing, where usability is measured with reference to the speed with which a task can be performed, the frequency of errors and user satisfaction with the interface.<ref name=\"Bethlehem 2012\" />\n\n====Key methodological issues of online surveys====\n* '''[[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]]'''. The difference between probability samples (where the inclusion probabilities for all units of the target population is known in advance) and non-probability samples (which often require less time and effort but generally do not support statistical inference) is crucial. Probability samples are highly affected by problems of non-coverage (not all members of the general population have Internet access) and frame problems (online survey invitations are most conveniently distributed using e-mail, but there are no e-mail directories of the general population that might be used as a sampling frame). Because coverage and frame problems can significantly impact data quality, they should be adequately reported when disseminating the research results.<ref name=\"Vehovar 2008\" /><ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Kevin|title=Researching Internet-Based Populations: Advantages and Disadvantages of Online Survey Research, Online Questionnaire Authoring Software Packages, and Web Survey Services|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=1 April 2005|volume=10|issue=3|pages=1034|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/3/JCMC1034/4614509|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n* '''Invitations''' to online surveys. Due to the lack of sampling frames many online survey invitations are published in the form of an URL link on web sites or in other media, which leads to sample selection bias that is out of research control and to non-probability samples. Traditional solicitation modes, such as telephone or mail invitations to web surveys, can help overcoming probability sampling issues in online surveys. However, such approaches are faced with problems of dramatically higher costs and questionable effectiveness.<ref name=\"Vehovar 2008\" />\n* '''[[Response rate (survey)|Non-response]]'''. Online survey response rates are generally low and also vary extremely \u2013 from less than 1% in enterprise surveys with e-mail invitations to almost 100% in specific membership surveys. In addition to refusing participation, terminating surveying during the process or not answering certain questions, several other non-response patterns can be observed in online surveys, such as lurking respondents and a combination of partial and item non-response.  Response rates can be increased by offering monetary or some other type of incentive to the respondents, by contacting respondents several times (follow-up), and by keeping the questionnaire difficulty as low as possible.<ref name=\"Vehovar 2008\" />  There are draw-backs to using an incentive to garner a response.  Non-bias responses could be questioned in this type of situation.  The most concrete way to gain feedback is to publicize what is done with the results.  To take concrete actions based on feedback and to show that to the customer base is extremely motivating to customers to continue to let their voice be heard.   \n* '''Acquiescence bias'''. Due to a phenomenon inherently present in human nature, many people have acquiescent personalities and are more likely to agree with statements than disagree - regardless of the content. Often, those people see the question-asker as an expert in their field which causes them to be more likely to react positively to the question asked. That being said, acquiescence bias (also known as the friendliness bias or \u201cyea-saying\u201d) manifests itself when a respondent shows a tendency to agree with whatever it is that you are asking or stating, even though they might not actually agree.<ref>Jovancic, Nemanja. [https://www.leadquizzes.com/blog/types-of-bias-in-research/ \"4 Types of Bias in Research and How to Make Your Surveys Bias-Free\"]. ''LeadQuizzes''. Retrieved March 16, 2020.</ref>\n* '''Platform Issues'''. Lack of familiarity with the platform used can cause participants and clients confusion.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n* '''Questionnaire design'''. While modern web questionnaires offer a range of design features (different question types, images, multimedia), the use of such elements should be limited to the extent necessary for respondents to understand questions or to stimulate the response. It should not affect their responses, because that would mean lower validity and reliability of data. Appropriate questionnaire design can help lowering the measurement error that can arise also due to the respondents or the survey mode itself (respondent\u2019s motivation, computer literacy, abilities, privacy concerns, etc.).<ref name=\"Vehovar 2008\" />\n* '''Post-survey adjustments'''. Various robust procedures have been developed for situations where sampling deviate from probability selection, or, when we face non-coverage and non-response problems. The standard statistical inference procedures (e.g. confidence interval calculations and hypothesis testing) still require a probability sample. The actual survey practice, particularly in marketing research and in public opinion polling, which massively neglects the principles of probability samples, increasingly requires from the statistical profession to specify the conditions where non-probability samples may work.<ref name=\"Vehovar 2008\" />\n\nThese issues, and potential remedies, are discussed in a number of sources.<ref>Salant, Priscilla, and Don A.

Twain did not confide her situation to school authorities, fearing they might break up the family. Her mother and stepfather's marriage was stormy at times, and from a young age she witnessed violence between them. Her mother also struggled with bouts of depression.

Although the work was demanding and the pay low, Twain said, \"I loved the feeling of being stranded. I'm not afraid of being in my own environment, being physical, working hard. I was very strong, I walked miles and miles every day and carried heavy loads of trees. You can't shampoo, use soap or deodorant, or makeup, nothing with any scent; you have to bathe and rinse your clothes in the lake.

She became acquainted with regional country singer Mary Bailey who had had some country chart success in 1976. Bailey had seen Twain perform in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario, saying \"I saw this little girl up on stage with a guitar and it absolutely blew me away. She performed [[Willie Nelson]]'s \"[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]\" and [[Hank Williams]]' \"[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]\".

In the fall of 1985, Bailey took Twain down to [[Nashville]] to stay with a friend, record producer Tony Migliore, who at the time was producing an album for fellow Canadian singer Kelita Haverland and Twain was featured on the backing vocals to the song ''Too Hot to Handle''. She also recorded \"demo\" songs with Cyril Rawson but those efforts were unsuccessful, partly due to Twain's wish to become a rock singer, not a country artist. After five months she returned to Canada and moved in with Bailey in a flat in downtown [[Kirkland Lake]], not far from Kenogami.<ref name=\"Eggar 2005 p=92\">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=92}}</ref>\nThere she met rock keyboardist Eric Lambier, drummer Randy Yurko, guitarist Tom Gustar and formed a new band, moving three months later to [[Bowmanville]], near Toronto. In late summer 1986, Mary Bailey arranged for Twain to meet [[John Kim Bell]], a half [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], half American conductor who had close contacts with the directors of the [[Canadian Country Music Association]]. Bell recognized Twain's ability as well as her looks and the two began secretly dating.<ref name=\"Eggar 2005 p=92\" /> In the fall of 1986 Twain continued to express her desire to be a pop or rock singer rather than country, which led to her falling out with Mary Bailey for two years. Twain's first break finally came on February 8, 1987, when Bell staged a fundraiser for the [[Indspire|National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation]], now Indspire, at the [[Roy Thomson Hall]] in Toronto where Twain performed with Broadway star [[Bernadette Peters]], guitarist [[Don Ross (guitarist)|Don Ross]], and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

''Up!'' was released with three different discs \u2013 country/acoustic (green CD), pop/rock (red CD), and world/dance (blue CD). ''Up!'' was given four out of five stars by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, and debuted at No.1 on the ''Billboard'' albums chart, selling 874,000 in the first week alone. It remained at the top of the charts for five weeks. Twain's crossover appeal in country, pop, and dance music, led the album ''Up!'' to sell over 11 million copies by 2004. ''Up!'' reached No.1 in Germany, No.2 in Australia and the Top Five in the UK and France. In Germany, ''Up!'' was certified 4x platinum and stayed in the Top 100 for one and a half years. The international music disc was remixed with Indian-style orchestral and percussion parts recorded in [[Mumbai]], India. The new versions were produced by Simon and [[Diamond Duggal]], brothers from [[Birmingham]], England.

It was a much bigger hit on the other side of the Atlantic, released in a pop version, the single hit No. 4 in the UK. In Australia, Germany and France the song reached the Top 15 in each case. The follow-up single, \"[[Up! (Shania Twain song)|Up!]]\", reached the Top 15 in the US country charts but failed to reach the pop Top 40. The second European single became the mid-tempo song \"[[Ka-Ching!]]\" (which was never released as a single in North America) with lyrics where Twain was criticizing unchecked consumerism. The song eventually became another smash hit in the important European markets, reaching No.1 in Germany and Austria and other European countries, the UK Top 10 and the Top 15 in France.\n\nThe third single from the album would be the most successful in the US. The romantic ballad \"[[Forever and for Always]]\" was released as a single in April 2003 and peaked at No.4 on the country chart and No.1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and made as well the ''Billboard'' Top 20. Again success was even bigger on the other side of the Atlantic with \"Forever and For Always\" again reaching the Top 10 in both, the UK and Germany. Further singles were \"[[She's Not Just a Pretty Face]]\", which was a country Top 10 hit, while the last US single, \"[[It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing]]\", made the Top 20 on both Country and AC. Due to the enormous European success of ''Up!'' and its first three singles, two more singles were released in the second half of 2003 with up-tempo \"[[Thank You Baby]]\" (No. 11 in the UK, Top 20 in Germany) and just before Christmas the romantic, acoustic ballad \"When You Kiss Me,\" at least a minor hit in both territories. The title track \"Up!\" also saw a single release in a limited edition of European countries, such as Germany, in early 2004.

I was very strong, I walked miles and miles every day and carried heavy loads of trees. You can't shampoo, use soap or deodorant, or makeup, nothing with any scent; you have to bathe and rinse your clothes in the lake.

She became acquainted with regional country singer Mary Bailey who had had some country chart success in 1976. Bailey had seen Twain perform in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario, saying \"I saw this little girl up on stage with a guitar and it absolutely blew me away. She performed [[Willie Nelson]]'s \"[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]\" and [[Hank Williams]]' \"[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]\".

In the fall of 1985, Bailey took Twain down to [[Nashville]] to stay with a friend, record producer Tony Migliore, who at the time was producing an album for fellow Canadian singer Kelita Haverland and Twain was featured on the backing vocals to the song ''Too Hot to Handle''. She also recorded \"demo\" songs with Cyril Rawson but those efforts were unsuccessful, partly due to Twain's wish to become a rock singer, not a country artist. After five months she returned to Canada and moved in with Bailey in a flat in downtown [[Kirkland Lake]], not far from Kenogami.<ref name=\"Eggar 2005 p=92\">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=92}}</ref>\nThere she met rock keyboardist Eric Lambier, drummer Randy Yurko, guitarist Tom Gustar and formed a new band, moving three months later to [[Bowmanville]], near Toronto. In late summer 1986, Mary Bailey arranged for Twain to meet [[John Kim Bell]], a half [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], half American conductor who had close contacts with the directors of the [[Canadian Country Music Association]]. Bell recognized Twain's ability as well as her looks and the two began secretly dating.<ref name=\"Eggar 2005 p=92\" /> In the fall of 1986 Twain continued to express her desire to be a pop or rock singer rather than country, which led to her falling out with Mary Bailey for two years. Twain's first break finally came on February 8, 1987, when Bell staged a fundraiser for the [[Indspire|National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation]], now Indspire, at the [[Roy Thomson Hall]] in Toronto where Twain performed with Broadway star [[Bernadette Peters]], guitarist [[Don Ross (guitarist)|Don Ross]], and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

The album failed to sell significant copies initially. However, Twain's future success generated enough interest for the album to be certified platinum six years later by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting sales of over 1 million. The album yielded two minor hit singles in the United States with \"[[What Made You Say That]]\" and \"[[Dance with the One That Brought You]]\". The album was more successful in Europe, where Twain won Country Music Television Europe's \"Rising Video Star of the Year\" award.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> In her 2011 autobiography ''From This Moment On'', Twain expressed displeasure with her debut studio album, revealing that she had very little creative control and expressed frustration with not being able to showcase her songwriting ability.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Twain|first1=Shania|title=From This Moment On|date=May 3, 2011|publisher=[[Atria Publishing Group]]|location=New York|isbn=9781451620740}}</ref>\n\n===1995\u20131996: ''The Woman in Me'' and commercial success===\nWhen rock producer [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] heard Twain's original songs and singing from her debut album, he offered to produce and write songs with her.

In 1998, following the pop release of \"You're Still the One\", the ''Come On Over'' album was released in a remixed format for the European market as a pop album with less country instrumentation, and actually gave her the big breakthrough in Europe she and her producer husband Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange were looking for. ''Come On Over'' went to No. 1 on the UK album charts for 11 weeks. It became the biggest selling album of the year in Great Britain and a bestseller in other big European markets as well, selling more than one million copies in Germany and nearly 4 million in the UK alone. Although \"You're Still The One\" and the pop version of \"From This Moment On\" cracked the Top 10 of the UK charts and \"When\" had minor success in the Top 20, the songs that had finally drawn European attention to the album were the pop remixed singles \"That Don't Impress Me Much\", a No.3 in the UK and Top 10 hit in Germany in the summer of 1999, and \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\" which peaked at No.3 in both the UK and France in autumn of that year. Additionally, \"You've Got a Way\" was remixed specifically for inclusion on the ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'' soundtrack. Subsequently, a reissue of the international version of the album was released worldwide, including the US and Europe, containing three of these new remixes. Additionally, the album set the record for the longest ever stay in the Top 20 of the ''Billboard'' 200, remaining in the Top 20 for 99 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/1999/country-albums|title=1999 Archive|website=Billboard|access-date=August 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190814041847/https://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/1999/country-albums|archive-date=August 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Twain launched her first major concert tour, aided by her manager [[Jon Landau]], a veteran of many large-scale tours with [[Bruce Springsteen]].

The follow-up single, \"[[Up! (Shania Twain song)|Up!]]\", reached the Top 15 in the US country charts but failed to reach the pop Top 40.

It formed a part of the [[War of the League of Cambrai]], during the ongoing [[Italian Wars]]. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] were besieging the town of [[Th\u00e9rouanne]] in [[Artois]] (now [[Pas-de-Calais]]). Henry's camp was at Guinegate, now called [[Enguinegatte]].<ref> English contemporary sources call the town \"Turwyn.\"</ref> A large body of French [[heavy cavalry]] under [[Jacques de La Palice]] was covering an attempt by [[light cavalry]] to bring supplies to the besieged garrison. [[Kingdom of England|English]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] troops surprised and routed this force. The battle was characterised by the precipitate flight and extensive pursuit of the French. During the pursuit a number of notable French leaders and knights were captured. After the fall of Th\u00e9rouanne, Henry VIII besieged and took [[Tournai]].\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Context===\nHenry VIII had joined in the Holy League, as the League of Cambrai was also known, on 13 October 1511 with Venice and Spain to defend the [[Papal states|Papacy]] from its enemies and France with military force. Henry promised to attack France at [[Guyenne]], landing 10,000 men at [[Hondarribia]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] in June 1512. This army was conveyed by the admiral [[Edward Howard (admiral)|Edward Howard]], and commanded by [[Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset]]. It remained at [[Bayonne]] till October 1512 supporting [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]'s action in the [[Kingdom of Navarre]], though undersupplied and in poor morale. Maximilian joined the league in November 1512. [[Louis XII of France]] hoped that Scotland would aid France against England.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackie|1952|pp=271\u20137}}; {{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=nos. 1176, 1239, 1286, 1292, 1326\u20137, 1375, 1422}}</ref>\n\n===Siege of Th\u00e9rouanne===\n[[File:Meeting of Henry VIII and Maximilian.png|thumb|Contemporary woodcut of the meeting of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]] at the siege of [[Th\u00e9rouanne]]]]\n\nIn May 1513 English soldiers began to arrive in number at [[Calais]] to join an army commanded by [[George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury|George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury]], [[Lord Steward of the Household]]. Shrewsbury was appointed Lieutenant-General on 12 May, John Hopton commanded the troop ships. On 17 May Henry announced to the [[Cinque Ports]] and [[Edward Poynings]], Constable of [[Dover Castle]], that he would join the invasion in person, and had appointed commissioners to requisition all shipping.

These may have been Albanian units.{{sfn|Hall|1809|pp=543, 550}}\n\nIn response to the new threat, English military engineers had built five bridges overnight over the [[Leie|river Lys]] to allow their army free passage to the other side and Henry moved his camp to Guinegate (now called ''Enguinegatte''), on 14 August, after displacing a company of French horse armed with spears who were stationed at the Tower of Guinegate.{{sfn|Grafton|1809|p=262}}\n\nThe French infantry were left at Blangy, while the heavy cavalry were divided into two companies, one under the command of La Palice and [[Louis I d'Orl\u00e9ans, duc de Longueville|Louis, Duke of Longueville]], the other under [[Charles IV, Duke of Alen\u00e7on]]. Alen\u00e7on's smaller force made an attack on the besieging positions commanded by [[George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury|Lord Shrewsbury]], the larger force against the south of the besieging lines where [[Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester|Lord Herbert]] commanded.{{sfn|Oman|1998|p=293}} Both attacks were designed to act as diversions in order that the stradiots be able to reach Th\u00e9rouanne with supplies. Each stradiot had a side of bacon at his saddlebow and a sack of gunpowder behind him.{{sfn|Oman|1998|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\n[[File:Tower of London (8145526931).jpg|thumb|right|An early armour of Henry VIII with a contemporary horse armour. Indicative of the appearance of English men-at-arms at the battle. Royal Armouries.]]\nThe French had hoped to catch the besieging army unprepared by moving out before dawn; however, the English 'border prickers' ([[Border reivers|light cavalry]] from the Scottish borders) were out and they detected the movement of the larger of the two bodies of French cavalry. Henry VIII drew up a field force from the siege lines sending out a vanguard of 1,100 cavalry, following this with 10,000\u201312,000 infantry. La Palice's force encountered English scouts at the village of [[Bomy]], 5 miles from Th\u00e9rouanne, the French, realising that the English were alert, checked themselves on the edge of a hillside. The stradiots then began their rather forlorn attempt to contact the garrison, riding in a wide arc towards the town.{{sfn|Oman|1998|p=293}}\n[[File:The Battle of the Spurs, from Der Weisskunig MET DP834057.jpg|thumb|right|A near contemporary illustration of the battle.

The English heavy cavalry of the vanguard drew up opposite Palice's front, while the mounted archers dismounted and shot at the French from a flanking hedgerow. Now aware of the approach of the English infantry in overwhelming numbers, La Palice tardily ordered his force to retreat. At this point the [[Clarenceux King of Arms|Clarenceux Herald]] is said to have urged the [[Henry Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] to charge. The English [[men-at-arms]] and other heavy cavalry charged, just as the French were moving off, throwing them into disorder. To complete the French disarray the stradiots, who had been driven off from approaching the town by cannon fire, crashed in confusion into the flank of the French heavy cavalry, whilst a body of Imperial cavalry also arrived to menace their other flank. Panic now seized the French cavalry, whose retreat became a rout. La Palice tried to rally them, but to no effect. In order to flee more quickly the French gendarmes threw away their lances and standards, some even cut away the heavy armour of their horses. The chase went on for many miles until the French reached their infantry at Blangy. During the pursuit many notable French knights were captured along with a royal duke and the French commander, La Palice, himself.{{sfn|Oman|1998|pp= 294\u2013295}} \n\nMeanwhile, the smaller French force had been driven off, Sir Rhys ap Thomas capturing four of their standards.{{sfn|Oman|1998|p=295}} The initial cavalry clash took place between the village of Bomy and Henry's camp at Guinegate.<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2227, newsletter locating the battle at Bomy}}; {{harvnb|Lingard|1860|pp=15\u201317}}; {{harvnb|Brown|1867|loc=no. 308 ([[Marino Sanuto the Younger|Sanuto]] diaries)}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary accounts===\nThe day was soon called the \"Battle of the Spurs\" (in French: ''La Journ\u00e9e d'Esperons'') because of the haste of the French horse to leave the battlefield. In the summer of 1518 the English ambassador in Spain, [[John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners|Lord Berners]], joked that the French had learned to ride fast at the \"jurney of Spurres.\"<ref>J. G. Nichols, ed., Diary of Henry Machyn'', Camden Society (1848), p. 401; ''Letters & Papers'', vol. 2 (1864), no. 4282</ref>\n\nThe same evening the [[Thurn-und-Taxis-Post|Imperial Master of the Posts, Baptiste de Tassis]] sent news of the battle to [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Savoy]] from [[Aire-sur-la-Lys]] in [[Artois]];<blockquote>\"Early in the day the Emperor and the King of England encountered 8,000 French horse; the Emperor, with 2,000 only, kept them at bay until four in the afternoon, when they were put to flight. A hundred men of arms were left upon the field, and more than a hundred taken prisoners, of the best men in France; as the Sieur de Piennes, the Marquis de Rotelin, and others.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2168, translated from French}}</ref></blockquote> Henry sent his own account to Margaret of Savoy on the following day. He mentioned that the French cavalry had first attacked Shrewsbury's position blockading the town, capturing 44 men and wounding 22. An Imperial cavalry manoeuvre brought the French horse within range of the guns, and the French cavalry fled.<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2170}}</ref>\n\nThe chronicle writer [[Edward Hall]] gave a somewhat different account. Hall, who says the French called it the \"battle of the Spurs\", centres the action around a hill, with English archers at the village of \"Bomye.\" He has the French cavalry break after a show of English banners organized by the [[Clarenceux King of Arms|Clarenceux Herald]] [[Thomas Benolt]]. Hall mentions that Maximilian advised Henry to deploy some artillery on another hill \"for out-scourers\" but does not mention any effect on the outcome. Although Henry wished to ride into the battle, he stayed with the Emperor's foot soldiers on the advice of his council.\n\nAfter a three-mile chase, amongst the French prisoners were [[Jacques de la Palice]], [[Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard]] and Louis d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Longueville. Although reports mention the Emperor's decision for his troops to serve under Henry's standard,<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2227}}</ref> Hall's account suggests friction between the English and Imperial forces, during the day and over prisoners taken by the Empire, who were \"not brought to sight\" and released. Henry returned to his camp at Enguinegatte and heard reports of the day's actions. During the fighting the garrison of Th\u00e9rouanne had come out and attacked Herbert's position.{{sfn|Hall|1809|pp=550\u2013551}} According to report, three English soldiers of note were killed, with 3,000 French casualties. Nine French standards were captured, with 21 noble prisoners dressed in cloth-of-gold.<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2227}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Fall of Th\u00e9rouanne===\nOn 20 August, now unthreatened by French counter-attacks, Henry moved his camp from Guinegate to the south of the town. Th\u00e9rouanne fell on 22 August, according to diplomatic reports the garrison were initially unimpressed by a show of captured colours, but the French and German garrison were drawn into negotiation with Shrewsbury by their lack of supplies. Shrewsbury welcomed Henry to the town and gave him the keys. Eight or nine hundred soldiers were set to work demolishing the walls of the town and three large bastions which were pushed into the deep defensive ditches. The dry ditches contained deeper pits which were designed for fires to create smoke to choke assailants. The Milanese ambassador to Maximilian, Paolo Da Laude, heard that it was planned to burn the town after demolition was completed.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|1867|loc=no. 308 (Sanuto diaries)}}; {{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2227}}</ref> On 5 September [[Pope Leo X]] was told of the English victories by the Florentine ambassador and his congratulations were conveyed to Cardinal Wolsey.<ref>Rymer, Thomas, ed., ''Foedera'', vol. 13 (1712), p. 376</ref>\n\n===Siege of Tournai===\nWhile demolition continued at Th\u00e9rouanne, after discussions on 4 September, allied attention moved to [[Tournai]], though Henry would have preferred an attack on [[Boulogne]]. Maximilian and Henry went to [[Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise|St Pol]], [[Saint-Venant|St Venan]], Neve and [[B\u00e9thune]], and on 10 September Henry entered [[Lille]] with great ceremony where Margaret of Savoy held court.

Catherine suggested Henry should use the coat as his battle-banner, and wrote that she had thought to send him the body too, but 'Englishmen's hearts would not suffer it.' It was suggested that James' body would be her exchange with Henry for his French prisoner, the [[Duke of Longueville]]. Longueville had been captured at Th\u00e9rouanne by John [[Clerke baronets|Clerke]] of [[Thame|North Weston]], sent to Catherine, and lodged in the [[Tower of London]]. The idea of an exchange was reported to [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso d'Este]] [[Duke of Ferrara and of Modena|Duke of Ferrara]] in Italy, that Catherine had promised, as Henry \"sent her a captive duke, she should soon send him a king\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ellis|1825|pp=82\u201384, 88\u201389}}; {{harvnb|Ellis|1846|pp=152\u2013154}}; {{harvnb|Brown|1867|loc=no. 328}}; {{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2268}}</ref>\n\nTournai fell to Henry VIII on 23 September. The defenders of Tournai had demolished houses in front of their gates on 11 September, and burnt their suburbs on 13 September. On 15 September the wives and children of the townspeople were ordered to repair damage to the walls caused by the besieger's cannon. On the same day the town council proposed a vote whether the town should declare for France or the Empire. The vote was suspended (''mis en surseance'') and the people appointed deputies to treat with Henry VIII. Charles Brandon captured one of the gatehouses and took away two of its statues as trophies, and the garrison negotiated with Henry and [[Richard Foxe]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], on 20 September 1513.<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=nos. 2286\u20137, 2294 (extracts from the records of Tournai.)}}; {{harvnb|Brown|1867|loc=no. 316}}</ref> The events within the town were misunderstood in English chronicles, [[Raphael Holinshed]] and [[Richard Grafton]] wrote that a disaffected \"vaunt-parler\" had set fire to the suburbs to hasten their surrender, while the Provost canvassed the townspeople's opinion.<ref>Grafton, Richard, ''Chronicle at Large'', vol. 2 (1809), p. 267; Holinshed, ''Chronicle'', vol 3 (1808), p. 588, a \"vaunt-parler\" was a spokesman, an official position in contemporary Tournai (e,g., ''L&P'', vol. 3, no. 493), but the term suggested busy-body in English.</ref>\n\nHenry attended mass in [[Tournai Cathedral]] on 2 October and knighted many of his captains.

The fortifications and a new citadel were reconstructed between August 1515 and January 1518, costing around \u00a340,000. Work ceased because Henry VIII planned to restore the town to France. Tournai was returned by [[Treaty of London (1518)|treaty on 4 October 1518]]. The surveyor of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]], Thomas Pawne, could not find a market for the unused building materials there, and sent stones by boat via Antwerp to Calais, some carved with English insignia, along with the machinery of two watermills.

The battle at Guinegate was described in this manner;<blockquote>\"About twelve o'clock the French in three divisions appeared upon another hill (for here and there are little hills and valleys); and as soon as the Emperor knew it he got up and sent for the German horsemen, numbering scarcely 1,050, and the Burgundians, about 1,000 (or 2,000), and commanded to muster the troops and to keep the Germans by him. The French united in one division amounting to 10,000 (or 7,000) cavalry in array and fired guns at the Emperor's horsemen, but all went too high and did no hurt. Thus the Burgundians and certain English struck [them], and as they turned and the Emperor saw the Burgundians hard pressed, he at once ordered the German horsemen to attack on the flank; but before they struck the French had turned about and fled. Our horsemen pursued them until within a short mile of their camp and brought back the prisoners and banners hereafter indicated. When the Emperor saw that no more harm could be done them, and they were near their camp wherein were yet 20,000 foot, he retired all the men in good order and marched to the camp, remaining all night in the field.

It formed a part of the [[War of the League of Cambrai]], during the ongoing [[Italian Wars]]. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] were besieging the town of [[Th\u00e9rouanne]] in [[Artois]] (now [[Pas-de-Calais]]). Henry's camp was at Guinegate, now called [[Enguinegatte]].<ref> English contemporary sources call the town \"Turwyn.\"</ref> A large body of French [[heavy cavalry]] under [[Jacques de La Palice]] was covering an attempt by [[light cavalry]] to bring supplies to the besieged garrison. [[Kingdom of England|English]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] troops surprised and routed this force. The battle was characterised by the precipitate flight and extensive pursuit of the French. During the pursuit a number of notable French leaders and knights were captured. After the fall of Th\u00e9rouanne, Henry VIII besieged and took [[Tournai]].\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Context===\nHenry VIII had joined in the Holy League, as the League of Cambrai was also known, on 13 October 1511 with Venice and Spain to defend the [[Papal states|Papacy]] from its enemies and France with military force. Henry promised to attack France at [[Guyenne]], landing 10,000 men at [[Hondarribia]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] in June 1512. This army was conveyed by the admiral [[Edward Howard (admiral)|Edward Howard]], and commanded by [[Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset]]. It remained at [[Bayonne]] till October 1512 supporting [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]'s action in the [[Kingdom of Navarre]], though undersupplied and in poor morale. Maximilian joined the league in November 1512. [[Louis XII of France]] hoped that Scotland would aid France against England.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackie|1952|pp=271\u20137}}; {{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=nos. 1176, 1239, 1286, 1292, 1326\u20137, 1375, 1422}}</ref>\n\n===Siege of Th\u00e9rouanne===\n[[File:Meeting of Henry VIII and Maximilian.png|thumb|Contemporary woodcut of the meeting of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]] at the siege of [[Th\u00e9rouanne]]]]\n\nIn May 1513 English soldiers began to arrive in number at [[Calais]] to join an army commanded by [[George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury|George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury]], [[Lord Steward of the Household]]. Shrewsbury was appointed Lieutenant-General on 12 May, John Hopton commanded the troop ships. On 17 May Henry announced to the [[Cinque Ports]] and [[Edward Poynings]], Constable of [[Dover Castle]], that he would join the invasion in person, and had appointed commissioners to requisition all shipping. In Henry's absence across the sea (''ad partes transmarinas''), [[Catherine of Aragon]] would rule England and Wales as Rector and Governor (''Rectrix et Gubernatrix'').{{sfn|Rymer|1712|pp=367\u2013370}}\n\nThe ''Chronicle of Calais'' recorded the names and arrivals of Henry's aristocratic military entourage from the 6 June 1513 onwards.

Eight hundred German mercenaries marched in front of Henry.\n\nShrewsbury set up a [[Artillery battery|battery]] and [[Mining (military)|dug mines]] towards the town's walls, but made little progress against the defending garrison of French and German soldiers in July. The town was held for France by [[Cr\u00e9quy family|Antoine de Cr\u00e9quy, sieur de Pont-Remy]] who returned fire until the town surrendered, and the English called one distinctive regular cannon shot the \"whistle.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Potter|2003|p=137}}; Hall, Edward, and Richard Grafton, ''Chronicle'' (1809), p. 259-264, has \"Bresquy\" for Cr\u00e9quy</ref> Reports of setbacks and inefficiency reached Venice.

In July a force of 800 Albanians commanded by Captain Fonterailles pushed through the besieger's lines and successfully delivered gunpowder and supplies including bacon to the gates of the town, leaving 80 soldiers as reinforcements. Fonterailles was helped by covering artillery fire from the town. Reports sent to Venice mentioned 300 English casualties or more, and Fonterailles' statement that the town could hold out till the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of the [[Nativity of Mary|Nativity of the Virgin]], on 8 September.

This French army was made up of companies of [[Gendarme (historical)|gendarmes]] and [[pikemen]], with some other troops as well. These included a type of French light cavalry called \"[[Stratioti|stradiotes]]\" (stradiots), equipped with short stirrups, beaver hats, light lances, and [[Kilij|Turkish swords]]. These may have been Albanian units.{{sfn|Hall|1809|pp=543, 550}}\n\nIn response to the new threat, English military engineers had built five bridges overnight over the [[Leie|river Lys]] to allow their army free passage to the other side and Henry moved his camp to Guinegate (now called ''Enguinegatte''), on 14 August, after displacing a company of French horse armed with spears who were stationed at the Tower of Guinegate.{{sfn|Grafton|1809|p=262}}\n\nThe French infantry were left at Blangy, while the heavy cavalry were divided into two companies, one under the command of La Palice and [[Louis I d'Orl\u00e9ans, duc de Longueville|Louis, Duke of Longueville]], the other under [[Charles IV, Duke of Alen\u00e7on]]. Alen\u00e7on's smaller force made an attack on the besieging positions commanded by [[George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury|Lord Shrewsbury]], the larger force against the south of the besieging lines where [[Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester|Lord Herbert]] commanded.{{sfn|Oman|1998|p=293}} Both attacks were designed to act as diversions in order that the stradiots be able to reach Th\u00e9rouanne with supplies. Each stradiot had a side of bacon at his saddlebow and a sack of gunpowder behind him.{{sfn|Oman|1998|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\n[[File:Tower of London (8145526931).jpg|thumb|right|An early armour of Henry VIII with a contemporary horse armour. Indicative of the appearance of English men-at-arms at the battle. Royal Armouries.]]\nThe French had hoped to catch the besieging army unprepared by moving out before dawn; however, the English 'border prickers' ([[Border reivers|light cavalry]] from the Scottish borders) were out and they detected the movement of the larger of the two bodies of French cavalry. Henry VIII drew up a field force from the siege lines sending out a vanguard of 1,100 cavalry, following this with 10,000\u201312,000 infantry. La Palice's force encountered English scouts at the village of [[Bomy]], 5 miles from Th\u00e9rouanne, the French, realising that the English were alert, checked themselves on the edge of a hillside. The stradiots then began their rather forlorn attempt to contact the garrison, riding in a wide arc towards the town.{{sfn|Oman|1998|p=293}}\n[[File:The Battle of the Spurs, from Der Weisskunig MET DP834057.jpg|thumb|right|A near contemporary illustration of the battle.

The English heavy cavalry of the vanguard drew up opposite Palice's front, while the mounted archers dismounted and shot at the French from a flanking hedgerow. Now aware of the approach of the English infantry in overwhelming numbers, La Palice tardily ordered his force to retreat. At this point the [[Clarenceux King of Arms|Clarenceux Herald]] is said to have urged the [[Henry Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] to charge. The English [[men-at-arms]] and other heavy cavalry charged, just as the French were moving off, throwing them into disorder. To complete the French disarray the stradiots, who had been driven off from approaching the town by cannon fire, crashed in confusion into the flank of the French heavy cavalry, whilst a body of Imperial cavalry also arrived to menace their other flank. Panic now seized the French cavalry, whose retreat became a rout. La Palice tried to rally them, but to no effect. In order to flee more quickly the French gendarmes threw away their lances and standards, some even cut away the heavy armour of their horses. The chase went on for many miles until the French reached their infantry at Blangy. During the pursuit many notable French knights were captured along with a royal duke and the French commander, La Palice, himself.{{sfn|Oman|1998|pp= 294\u2013295}} \n\nMeanwhile, the smaller French force had been driven off, Sir Rhys ap Thomas capturing four of their standards.{{sfn|Oman|1998|p=295}} The initial cavalry clash took place between the village of Bomy and Henry's camp at Guinegate.<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2227, newsletter locating the battle at Bomy}}; {{harvnb|Lingard|1860|pp=15\u201317}}; {{harvnb|Brown|1867|loc=no. 308 ([[Marino Sanuto the Younger|Sanuto]] diaries)}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary accounts===\nThe day was soon called the \"Battle of the Spurs\" (in French: ''La Journ\u00e9e d'Esperons'') because of the haste of the French horse to leave the battlefield. In the summer of 1518 the English ambassador in Spain, [[John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners|Lord Berners]], joked that the French had learned to ride fast at the \"jurney of Spurres.\"<ref>J. G. Nichols, ed., Diary of Henry Machyn'', Camden Society (1848), p. 401; ''Letters & Papers'', vol. 2 (1864), no. 4282</ref>\n\nThe same evening the [[Thurn-und-Taxis-Post|Imperial Master of the Posts, Baptiste de Tassis]] sent news of the battle to [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Savoy]] from [[Aire-sur-la-Lys]] in [[Artois]];<blockquote>\"Early in the day the Emperor and the King of England encountered 8,000 French horse; the Emperor, with 2,000 only, kept them at bay until four in the afternoon, when they were put to flight. A hundred men of arms were left upon the field, and more than a hundred taken prisoners, of the best men in France; as the Sieur de Piennes, the Marquis de Rotelin, and others.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2168, translated from French}}</ref></blockquote> Henry sent his own account to Margaret of Savoy on the following day. He mentioned that the French cavalry had first attacked Shrewsbury's position blockading the town, capturing 44 men and wounding 22. An Imperial cavalry manoeuvre brought the French horse within range of the guns, and the French cavalry fled.<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2170}}</ref>\n\nThe chronicle writer [[Edward Hall]] gave a somewhat different account. Hall, who says the French called it the \"battle of the Spurs\", centres the action around a hill, with English archers at the village of \"Bomye.\" He has the French cavalry break after a show of English banners organized by the [[Clarenceux King of Arms|Clarenceux Herald]] [[Thomas Benolt]]. Hall mentions that Maximilian advised Henry to deploy some artillery on another hill \"for out-scourers\" but does not mention any effect on the outcome. Although Henry wished to ride into the battle, he stayed with the Emperor's foot soldiers on the advice of his council.\n\nAfter a three-mile chase, amongst the French prisoners were [[Jacques de la Palice]], [[Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard]] and Louis d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Longueville. Although reports mention the Emperor's decision for his troops to serve under Henry's standard,<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2227}}</ref> Hall's account suggests friction between the English and Imperial forces, during the day and over prisoners taken by the Empire, who were \"not brought to sight\" and released. Henry returned to his camp at Enguinegatte and heard reports of the day's actions. During the fighting the garrison of Th\u00e9rouanne had come out and attacked Herbert's position.{{sfn|Hall|1809|pp=550\u2013551}} According to report, three English soldiers of note were killed, with 3,000 French casualties.

Th\u00e9rouanne fell on 22 August, according to diplomatic reports the garrison were initially unimpressed by a show of captured colours, but the French and German garrison were drawn into negotiation with Shrewsbury by their lack of supplies. Shrewsbury welcomed Henry to the town and gave him the keys. Eight or nine hundred soldiers were set to work demolishing the walls of the town and three large bastions which were pushed into the deep defensive ditches. The dry ditches contained deeper pits which were designed for fires to create smoke to choke assailants. The Milanese ambassador to Maximilian, Paolo Da Laude, heard that it was planned to burn the town after demolition was completed.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|1867|loc=no. 308 (Sanuto diaries)}}; {{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2227}}</ref> On 5 September [[Pope Leo X]] was told of the English victories by the Florentine ambassador and his congratulations were conveyed to Cardinal Wolsey.<ref>Rymer, Thomas, ed., ''Foedera'', vol. 13 (1712), p. 376</ref>\n\n===Siege of Tournai===\nWhile demolition continued at Th\u00e9rouanne, after discussions on 4 September, allied attention moved to [[Tournai]], though Henry would have preferred an attack on [[Boulogne]].

It was suggested that James' body would be her exchange with Henry for his French prisoner, the [[Duke of Longueville]]. Longueville had been captured at Th\u00e9rouanne by John [[Clerke baronets|Clerke]] of [[Thame|North Weston]], sent to Catherine, and lodged in the [[Tower of London]]. The idea of an exchange was reported to [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso d'Este]] [[Duke of Ferrara and of Modena|Duke of Ferrara]] in Italy, that Catherine had promised, as Henry \"sent her a captive duke, she should soon send him a king\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ellis|1825|pp=82\u201384, 88\u201389}}; {{harvnb|Ellis|1846|pp=152\u2013154}}; {{harvnb|Brown|1867|loc=no. 328}}; {{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2268}}</ref>\n\nTournai fell to Henry VIII on 23 September. The defenders of Tournai had demolished houses in front of their gates on 11 September, and burnt their suburbs on 13 September. On 15 September the wives and children of the townspeople were ordered to repair damage to the walls caused by the besieger's cannon. On the same day the town council proposed a vote whether the town should declare for France or the Empire. The vote was suspended (''mis en surseance'') and the people appointed deputies to treat with Henry VIII.

The surveyor of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]], Thomas Pawne, could not find a market for the unused building materials there, and sent stones by boat via Antwerp to Calais, some carved with English insignia, along with the machinery of two watermills. The construction work at Tournai has been characterized as retrogressive, lacking the input of a professional [[Military engineering|military engineer]], and an \"essentially medieval\" conception out of step with Italian innovations.<ref>Colvin, Howard, ed., ''History of the King's Works'', vol. 3 part 1, HMSO (1975), pp. 375\u2013382; {{harvnb|Cruikshank|1971|pp=169\u2013175}}; Pepper, Simon, ''The chivalric ethos and the development of Military Professionalism'', (2003), p. 136; Hocquet, A., 'Tournai et l'occupation Anglaise,' in ''Annales de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Historique et Arch\u00e9oloqie de Tournai'', no. 5 (1900), p.325</ref>\n\n===Propaganda===\n[[File:Innsbruck 1 312.jpg|thumb|Marble relief at the [[Hofkirche, Innsbruck]] by [[Alexander Colyn]], 1553, after [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] showing the meeting of Maximilian and Henry at Th\u00e9rouanne]]\nHenry and Maximilian jointly published an account of their victories, under the title; ''Copia von der erlichen und kostlichen enpfahung ouch fr\u00fcntliche erbietung desz K\u00fcngs von Engelland Keyser Maximilian in Bickardy'' ([[Picardy]]) ''gethon, Unnd von dem angryff und nyderlegung do selbs vor Terbona'' (Th\u00e9rouanne) ''gesch\u00e4hen.

Also what and how many people there were slain and captured. Also the siege of the town of Tournay and other strange histories.''The book contains a woodcut of their meeting and one of Maximilian in battle. The battle at Guinegate was described in this manner;<blockquote>\"About twelve o'clock the French in three divisions appeared upon another hill (for here and there are little hills and valleys); and as soon as the Emperor knew it he got up and sent for the German horsemen, numbering scarcely 1,050, and the Burgundians, about 1,000 (or 2,000), and commanded to muster the troops and to keep the Germans by him. The French united in one division amounting to 10,000 (or 7,000) cavalry in array and fired guns at the Emperor's horsemen, but all went too high and did no hurt. Thus the Burgundians and certain English struck [them], and as they turned and the Emperor saw the Burgundians hard pressed, he at once ordered the German horsemen to attack on the flank; but before they struck the French had turned about and fled. Our horsemen pursued them until within a short mile of their camp and brought back the prisoners and banners hereafter indicated. When the Emperor saw that no more harm could be done them, and they were near their camp wherein were yet 20,000 foot, he retired all the men in good order and marched to the camp, remaining all night in the field. In this skirmish the English used no other cry than Burgundia.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2173 & extract translated in appendix}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAn Italian poem, ''La Rotta de Francciosi a Terroana'' on the fall of Therouanne was printed in Rome in September 1513.<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1920|loc=no. 2247}}, noted: reprinted ''La Rotta de Francciosi a Terroana novamente facta, La Rotta do Scocesi'', [[Roxburghe Club]], no. 37, (1825), presented by [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]].</ref> Maximilian also commissioned woodcut images of his meeting with Henry from [[Leonhard Beck]], and from [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] who included a scene of the mounted rulers joining hands in the [[Triumphal Arch (woodcut)|''Triumphal Arch'']].<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database.aspx See \"Historical subjects from the Triumphal Arch,\" British Museum collection database];
