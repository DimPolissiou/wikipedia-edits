[[Music of Neon Genesis Evangelion|Music for the series]] was composed by [[Shir\u014d Sagisu]].\n\n''Evangelion'' is set fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm, particularly in the futuristic fortified city of Tokyo-3. The [[protagonist]] is Shinji, a teenage boy who was recruited by his father [[Gendo Ikari|Gendo]] to the shadowy organization Nerv to pilot a giant bio-machine [[mecha]] called an \"[[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelion]]\" into combat with alien beings called \"[[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)|Angels]]\".

Regarded as a deconstruction of the [[mecha]] genre, the original TV series led to a rebirth of the anime industry and has become a cultural icon. Film, [[manga]], home video, and other products in the [[Neon Genesis Evangelion (franchise)|''Evangelion'' franchise]] have achieved record sales in Japanese markets and strong sales in overseas markets, with related goods selling over {{JPY|150 billion}} by 2007 and ''Evangelion'' [[pachinko]] machines selling {{JPY|700 billion}} by 2015.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{See also|List of Neon Genesis Evangelion episodes}}\nIn 2015, fifteen years after a global cataclysm known as the Second Impact, teenager [[Shinji Ikari]] is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father [[Gendo Ikari]], director of the special paramilitary force Nerv. Shinji witnesses [[United Nations]] forces battling an Angel, one of a race of giant monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Because of the Angels' near-impenetrable force-fields, Nerv's giant Evangelion bio-machines, synchronized to the nervous systems of their pilots and possessing their own force-fields, are the only weapons capable of keeping the Angels from annihilating humanity. Nerv officer [[Misato Katsuragi]] escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath the city, where his father pressures him into piloting the Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angel. Without training, Shinji is quickly overwhelmed in the battle, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its own.\n\nFollowing hospitalization, Shinji moves in with Misato and settles into life in Tokyo-3. In his second battle, Shinji destroys an Angel but runs away afterwards, distraught. Misato confronts Shinji and he decides to remain a pilot. The Nerv crew and Shinji must then battle and defeat the remaining 14 Angels in order to prevent the Third Impact, a global cataclysm that would destroy the world. Evangelion Unit-00 is repaired shortly afterwards. Shinji tries to befriend its pilot, the mysterious, socially isolated teenage girl [[Rei Ayanami]]. With Rei's help, Shinji defeats another Angel. They are then joined by the pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, the multitalented, but insufferable teenager [[Asuka Langley S\u014dryu]], who is German-Japanese-American. Together, the three of them manage to defeat several Angels. As Shinji adjusts to his new role as a pilot, he gradually becomes more confident and self-assured. Asuka moves in with Shinji, and they begin to develop confused feelings for one another, kissing at her provocation.\n\nAfter being absorbed by an Angel, Shinji breaks free thanks to the Eva acting on its own. He is later forced to fight an infected Evangelion Unit-03 and watches its pilot, his friend and classmate [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Toji Suzuhara|Toji Suzuhara]], incapacitated and presumably permanently disabled. Asuka loses her self-confidence following a defeat and spirals into depression. This is worsened by her next fight, against an [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Arael|Angel]] which attacks her mind and forces her to relive her worst fears and childhood trauma, resulting in a mental breakdown. In the next battle, Rei self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's life. Misato and Shinji visit the hospital where they find Rei alive but claiming she is \"the third Rei\". Misato forces scientist [[Ritsuko Akagi]] to reveal the dark secrets of Nerv, the Evangelion boneyard and the dummy plug system which operates using clones of Rei, who was herself created with the DNA of his mother, [[Yui Ikari]]. This succession of events leaves Shinji emotionally scarred and alienated from the rest of the characters. [[Kaworu Nagisa]] replaces the catatonic Asuka as pilot of Unit-02. Kaworu, who initially befriends Shinji and gains his trust, is in truth the final foretold Angel, Tabris. Kaworu fights Shinji, then realizes that he must die if humanity is to survive and asks Shinji to kill him. Shinji hesitates but eventually kills Kaworu, causing Shinji to be overridden with guilt.\n\nAfter the final Angel is defeated, Seele, the mysterious cabal overseeing the events of the series, triggers the \"Human Instrumentality Project\", a forced evolution of humanity in which the souls of all mankind are merged for benevolent purposes, believing that if unified, humanity could finally overcome the loneliness and alienation that has eternally plagued mankind. Shinji's soul grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches an epiphany that he needs others to thrive, enabling him to destroy the wall of negative emotions that torment him and reunite with the others, who congratulate him.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{Main|List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters}}\n[[File:Characters of Evangelion.jpg|upright=1.81|left|thumb|The cast of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' as depicted on the Japanese \"Genesis\" (volume) 14 [[laserdisc]] and [[VHS]] cover]]\n\nHideaki Anno attempted to create characters that reflected parts of his own personality.<ref name=JEN>{{cite news |last=Kosukegawa |first=Yoichi |title=Cartoon 'Eva' captures sense of void among Japanese youth |newspaper=Japan Economic Newswire |date=May 8, 1997 |quote=In the September 1996 issue of the Quick Japan information magazine, Hideaki Anno, the director of Evangelion, described Eva as a 'personal film,' each character reflecting part of his own personality.}}</ref> The characters of ''Evangelion'' struggle with their interpersonal relationships, their personal problems,{{sfn|Napier|2002|p=425}} and traumatic events in their past.{{sfn|Miller|2012|p=85}}{{sfn|Ishikawa|2007|p=76}} The human qualities of the characters have enabled some viewers of the show to identify with the characters on a personal level, while others interpret them as historical, religious, or philosophical symbols.<ref name=\"Eng-DVD-commentary\">{{cite video |people= |date= |title=Evangelion: Death & Rebirth; End of Evangelion |medium=DVD commentary track |location= |publisher=Manga Entertainment}}</ref> [[Shinji Ikari]] is the series protagonist and the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit-01.

Similar to Shinji, he is somewhat asocial and is afraid of being insulted by others and often runs away from such, often committing immoralities in the process.

[[Music of Neon Genesis Evangelion|Music for the series]] was composed by [[Shir\u014d Sagisu]].\n\n''Evangelion'' is set fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm, particularly in the futuristic fortified city of Tokyo-3. The [[protagonist]] is Shinji, a teenage boy who was recruited by his father [[Gendo Ikari|Gendo]] to the shadowy organization Nerv to pilot a giant bio-machine [[mecha]] called an \"[[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelion]]\" into combat with alien beings called \"[[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)|Angels]]\". The series explores the experiences and emotions of Evangelion pilots and members of Nerv as they try to prevent Angels from causing more cataclysms.

Regarded as a deconstruction of the [[mecha]] genre, the original TV series led to a rebirth of the anime industry and has become a cultural icon. Film, [[manga]], home video, and other products in the [[Neon Genesis Evangelion (franchise)|''Evangelion'' franchise]] have achieved record sales in Japanese markets and strong sales in overseas markets, with related goods selling over {{JPY|150 billion}} by 2007 and ''Evangelion'' [[pachinko]] machines selling {{JPY|700 billion}} by 2015.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{See also|List of Neon Genesis Evangelion episodes}}\nIn 2015, fifteen years after a global cataclysm known as the Second Impact, teenager [[Shinji Ikari]] is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father [[Gendo Ikari]], director of the special paramilitary force Nerv. Shinji witnesses [[United Nations]] forces battling an Angel, one of a race of giant monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Because of the Angels' near-impenetrable force-fields, Nerv's giant Evangelion bio-machines, synchronized to the nervous systems of their pilots and possessing their own force-fields, are the only weapons capable of keeping the Angels from annihilating humanity. Nerv officer [[Misato Katsuragi]] escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath the city, where his father pressures him into piloting the Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angel. Without training, Shinji is quickly overwhelmed in the battle, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its own.\n\nFollowing hospitalization, Shinji moves in with Misato and settles into life in Tokyo-3. In his second battle, Shinji destroys an Angel but runs away afterwards, distraught. Misato confronts Shinji and he decides to remain a pilot. The Nerv crew and Shinji must then battle and defeat the remaining 14 Angels in order to prevent the Third Impact, a global cataclysm that would destroy the world. Evangelion Unit-00 is repaired shortly afterwards. Shinji tries to befriend its pilot, the mysterious, socially isolated teenage girl [[Rei Ayanami]]. With Rei's help, Shinji defeats another Angel. They are then joined by the pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, the multitalented, but insufferable teenager [[Asuka Langley S\u014dryu]], who is German-Japanese-American. Together, the three of them manage to defeat several Angels. As Shinji adjusts to his new role as a pilot, he gradually becomes more confident and self-assured. Asuka moves in with Shinji, and they begin to develop confused feelings for one another, kissing at her provocation.\n\nAfter being absorbed by an Angel, Shinji breaks free thanks to the Eva acting on its own. He is later forced to fight an infected Evangelion Unit-03 and watches its pilot, his friend and classmate [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Toji Suzuhara|Toji Suzuhara]], incapacitated and presumably permanently disabled. Asuka loses her self-confidence following a defeat and spirals into depression. This is worsened by her next fight, against an [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Arael|Angel]] which attacks her mind and forces her to relive her worst fears and childhood trauma, resulting in a mental breakdown. In the next battle, Rei self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's life. Misato and Shinji visit the hospital where they find Rei alive but claiming she is \"the third Rei\". Misato forces scientist [[Ritsuko Akagi]] to reveal the dark secrets of Nerv, the Evangelion boneyard and the dummy plug system which operates using clones of Rei, who was herself created with the DNA of his mother, [[Yui Ikari]]. This succession of events leaves Shinji emotionally scarred and alienated from the rest of the characters. [[Kaworu Nagisa]] replaces the catatonic Asuka as pilot of Unit-02. Kaworu, who initially befriends Shinji and gains his trust, is in truth the final foretold Angel, Tabris. Kaworu fights Shinji, then realizes that he must die if humanity is to survive and asks Shinji to kill him. Shinji hesitates but eventually kills Kaworu, causing Shinji to be overridden with guilt.\n\nAfter the final Angel is defeated, Seele, the mysterious cabal overseeing the events of the series, triggers the \"Human Instrumentality Project\", a forced evolution of humanity in which the souls of all mankind are merged for benevolent purposes, believing that if unified, humanity could finally overcome the loneliness and alienation that has eternally plagued mankind. Shinji's soul grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches an epiphany that he needs others to thrive, enabling him to destroy the wall of negative emotions that torment him and reunite with the others, who congratulate him.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{Main|List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters}}\n[[File:Characters of Evangelion.jpg|upright=1.81|left|thumb|The cast of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' as depicted on the Japanese \"Genesis\" (volume) 14 [[laserdisc]] and [[VHS]] cover]]\n\nHideaki Anno attempted to create characters that reflected parts of his own personality.<ref name=JEN>{{cite news |last=Kosukegawa |first=Yoichi |title=Cartoon 'Eva' captures sense of void among Japanese youth |newspaper=Japan Economic Newswire |date=May 8, 1997 |quote=In the September 1996 issue of the Quick Japan information magazine, Hideaki Anno, the director of Evangelion, described Eva as a 'personal film,' each character reflecting part of his own personality.}}</ref> The characters of ''Evangelion'' struggle with their interpersonal relationships, their personal problems,{{sfn|Napier|2002|p=425}} and traumatic events in their past.{{sfn|Miller|2012|p=85}}{{sfn|Ishikawa|2007|p=76}} The human qualities of the characters have enabled some viewers of the show to identify with the characters on a personal level, while others interpret them as historical, religious, or philosophical symbols.<ref name=\"Eng-DVD-commentary\">{{cite video |people= |date= |title=Evangelion: Death & Rebirth; End of Evangelion |medium=DVD commentary track |location= |publisher=Manga Entertainment}}</ref> [[Shinji Ikari]] is the series protagonist and the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit-01.

Gendo salvaged the remains of his dead wife's body to create Rei, whom he viewed as a mere tool at his disposal to defeat the Angels and enact Instrumentality. Similar to Shinji, he is somewhat asocial and is afraid of being insulted by others and often runs away from such, often committing immoralities in the process.

A \"solid black\" cat may be coal black, grayish black, or brownish black. Most solid-colored cats result from a recessive gene that suppresses the [[Tabby cat|tabby]] pattern. Sometimes the tabby pattern is not completely suppressed; faint markings may appear in certain lights, even on a solid black cat.

High Priest, puts a young girl named Myne into a deep sleep and probes her mind regarding her past and her abnormal love for books. He sees that Myne used to be known as Motosu Urano from another land and time. She loved every kind of literature in existence, but she was suddenly crushed to death under a pile of books. As she died, she wished that she would be able to read all kinds of books in her next life. She hears a small voice crying out in pain before awakening in the body of the young girl named Myne who is bedridden due to a fever. Confused about her surroundings, she asks her new mother, Effa, and elder sister, Tuuli, where she can find books to read, but they don't seem to understand. When they leave to prepare dinner, Myne searches the house, but finds out it is only a small wooden cabin with no books in sight, or even any paper, causing her to cry. After a few days, the only convenience Myne can find is by putting a pin in her long hair to keep it up, which surprises Tuuli. When Effa asks Myne to accompany her to the food market, she agrees, believing it to be a way to find books outside her home. Looking around town, she realizes that she lives in the slightly impoverished side of a classic medieval town, as well as that her father, Gunther, is a guard along the town border. When they reach the market, Myne finds a single book enclosed in a locked glass case at a stall. She asks the owner if she can see it, but the man tells her that books are rare and only nobles are allowed to handle them. Undeterred, Myne says that if she cannot buy books anywhere, she will have to make them herself.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Life Improvements and Slates \n| TranslitTitle       = Seikatsu kaizen to Sekiban\n| NativeTitle         = \u751f\u6d3b\u6539\u5584\u3068\u77f3\u677f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|10}}\n| ShortSummary        = Irritated by her ragged and itchy hair, Myne takes a fruit that Tuuli bought at the market and extracts its oil, creating a basic shampoo that cleans her hair, shocking both Effa and Tuuli. The next day, Gunther forgets a package at home, so Myne and Tuuli attempt to make the trek to his stationed gate to bring it to him. Outside their townhouse door, they meet Lutz, Ralph, and Fey, a family trio of boys who also live in the neighborhood. Exhausted from the walk outside, Myne collapses and is given a ride on Ralph's back to the gate, to Lutz's slight disappointment. Along the way, Myne is able to determine Ralph's feelings for Tuuli, as well as Lutz's possible feelings for herself. They reach the gate and deliver the package to Gunther, where the boys then split off to go cut wood in the forest. Gunter introduces Myne and Tuuli to his partner Otto, who suddenly pulls out a scroll made of animal hide. Intrigued, Myne asks her father to buy parchment for her, but is declined when he tells her she cannot read or write, as well its high cost. Otto offers to teach Myne to read and write on a small chalkboard-like slate, to which she then happily agrees, surprising Gunther with slight jealousy. The season begins to cool, halting Myne's progress as she helps her family pack for the town's fall festival. The family travels to the festival location where Myne is forced to sit off to the side due to her frailty. She ponders how writing had advanced through civilizations and comes up with the idea of weaving fiber-like papyrus as a paper substitute, similar to what ancient Egyptians did. Before she can plan this out, she faints when she sees a pig slaughtered up close, causing Gunther to bring her back to the gate to Otto. After she wakes, Otto hands her the slate and writes her name for her in the new language so she can practice. As she practices, he begins to subconsciously write in Japanese and writes down the names of everyone she has met thus far. When Otto returns, he finds Myne passed out from a fever and rushes her home. That night, she encourages herself on her progress with writing before wondering what great idea she had before she suddenly fainted at the festival.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = The Events of Winter\n| TranslitTitle       = Fuyu no Dekigoto\n| NativeTitle         = \u51ac\u306e\u3067\u304d\u3054\u3068\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|17}}\n| ShortSummary        = Two months after Myne's consciousness came to the new world, winter struck the town hard and buried it in snow. Since every day is spent indoors, Myne attempts to shave the fibers off of twigs to weave into a pseudo-papyrus paper. After three days of working and weaving, she hardly gets a single corner completed before giving up in frustration at her slow progress. Effa comes up with an idea for Myne to help weave baskets, to which Myne has prior knowledge of how to make from when she was back in Japan. Myne makes her basket with ease and surprises Tuuli and Effa with its efficiency, though Tuuli gets upset since she wants to become an apprentice seamstress and Myne appears to be better than her. Effa offers to teach Tuuli how to weave up to her 7th birthday, which is when the town's children become baptized and choose a profession. Effa tries to ring Myne in as well, but she politely declines in favor of her next goal, which is waiting until spring to make clay tablets similar to those of ancient Mesopotamia. The next morning, Tuuli and Gunther go and pick parues, which are fruit from completely iced-over trees. The fruit can be used as both a drinkable juice and a type of bird feed, but after accidentally tasting the feed and finding it edible, Myne figures out how to turn it into a type of pancake, which her family and the neighbor boys enjoy. That night, Effa and Tuuli begin to question where Myne is getting her ideas from, but Gunther says he prefers this Myne over a sad and sick one. At the same time, Myne's slate pencil wears itself out, so she asks Gunther to take her to the gate to get it replaced, much to his chagrin. He drops Myne off the next day, and Otto gives Myne a new pencil to work with. As Otto begins his work, Myne corrects him on a few calculations, surprising him. He asks her to help out, to which she agrees in exchange for a constant supply of slate pencils. That night, while Tuuli has a dress prepared for her upcoming baptism, Myne decides to create a hair ornament for her to look her best.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = Forests and Clay Tablets \n| TranslitTitle       = Hajimete no Mori to Nendo ban\n| NativeTitle         = \u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u68ee\u3068\u7c98\u571f\u677f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|24}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne decides to cook dinner for the family and, using cooking tactics from Japan, surprises them on how good it is. Gunther and Effa decide on whether to show Myne to a cooking apprentice, but she heartily declines, stating she wants to go to the forest in search of clay. Her family eventually dissuade her, claiming she is not strong enough to go to the forest and that she needs to build up her strength first. Later on, Gunther tells Myne that Otto has asked for her to be his calculations assistant, though it is unofficial since unbaptized children cannot work. She arrives at the gate to see Otto teaching a class of older kids how to write, and while it was awkward to start, the class warms up to Myne and eventually begin learning from her. After the students leave, Otto rewards her by teaching her how to write complete words. While she frequently got sick near the beginning, Myne eventually builds up her stamina enough to go to the forest, but ends up getting sick the day she was supposed to go. Once spring ended, Myne finally was able to go into the forest with Lutz's family and Tuuli. She begins digging for clay, but is caught by Lutz, who after scolding her for not resting, helps her find the right spots to dig. They find a hot spot for clay, allowing Myne to collect and flatten them out into many individual tablets to write on. Myne completes a story Effa tells her when she is sick onto the tablets and leaves them out to dry, but Lutz's brothers crush them, believing them to be cushions. Heartbroken, Myne begins to mysteriously glow as she shouts and berates the boys, before Lutz arrives and calms her down. As she sadly begins digging again, Lutz orders the boys to help her as penance. They are able to recreate the tablets, but they are washed away in the rain the next day. As they build the clay book for a third time, Lutz and Myne exchange their dreams for the future; Lutz to be a traveling merchant and Myne a librarian. They complete the tablets and Myne brings them home to harden in the fireplace, but they instantly shatter, causing Myne to shout in frustration.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Baptisms and Strange Fevers \n| TranslitTitle       = Senreishiki to Fushigina Netsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u6d17\u793c\u5f0f\u3068\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u71b1\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|31}}\n| ShortSummary        = Tuuli's baptism day arrives and her hair ornament is the talk of the neighborhood. Though he wants to stay and watch the parade, Gunther is forced to work, so he brings Myne with him to the gate. While there, a messenger arrives while Otto is away, but Myne offers to read and deliver the message to Otto, surprising the messenger. That night, as Tuuli tells everyone about her day, Gunther presents with her a sewing kit as a gift. He also gives Myne a knife and tells her that she will now be the house helper instead. However, she comes up with the idea to carve tree bark into wooden planks to write on, similar to that of ancient China. The next day, she goes into the forest with Lutz and begins carving her planks, but to low success. Lutz decides to help, but in exchange for an opportunity to meet Otto in regards to being a traveling merchant. Myne asks Otto about the traveling trade, but Otto states that it isn't a good profession for a city child, although he agrees to talk with Lutz about it. Myne collects all the planks and brings them to her family storage room to dry. She then thinks about what to write with and comes up with the idea to use soot. Mixing soot with clay, Myne creates a basic black pencil to use to write on the planks, but when she arrives home, the planks are gone and Effa is revealed to have used them for firewood. Distraught, Myne begins to mysteriously glow again, but suddenly collapses with a terrible fever. Lutz arrives and cheers Myne up, telling her to keep moving forward. While she stays in bed, Lutz brings her bamboo strips to work on, but Effa burns them as well, believing them to be more kindling for the fire. Myne starts to glow again and contemplates giving up entirely, but the thought of Lutz helping her persuades her to keep trying. As she calms down, her fever does also, begging her to question what sort of sickness her body really has. Once she's healed, Myne meets with Otto and they plan a day for Lutz and Otto to meet.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| Title               = Meeting\n| TranslitTitle       = Kaigo\n| NativeTitle         = \u4f1a\u5408\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|7}}\n| ShortSummary        = Before their meeting with Otto, Myne decides to wash Lutz's hair with her shampoo so he can look his best. Afterwards, she asks why he wants to be a traveling merchant, but he responds with his own questions regarding what she wants to do. She reveals that she's changed her goal from selling books to selling paper, hinting that she wants his help. The meeting day arrives, but Otto shows up with an old partner named Benno, a town merchant and former traveling trader. Benno becomes immediately interested in children's clean hair and Myne's hair pin, but she says the details are a secret. Otto deters Lutz from becoming a traveling merchant on the ground of losing one's citizenship, meaning they cannot reside in any town or have any sort of luxury. Coming to terms with this, Lutz chooses to help Myne make paper and sell it. Myne reveals her idea for making paper from plants and selling them for profit, though Benno questions its authenticity. Myne promises a prototype before her baptism and Benno agrees to sponsor her if it comes true. Myne goes over what tools she needs and asks Lutz to find a suitable tree to use to extract its fibers. Otto offers to give Myne nails to use to build her tools in exchange for the use of her shampoo for his wife. She agrees and meets his wife Corinna, an executive in the Seamstress Guild and Benno's sister, and washes her hair for the nails. Myne and Lutz try to build their tools, but can't get the exact proportions quite right. At the gate, Otto gives Myne and Lutz invitations from Benno to meet with him, when suddenly Otto remembers from their meeting that Benno believes Myne's illness is called the \"Devouring\" and is fatal.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| Title               = Seeds of Suspicion\n| TranslitTitle       = Fushin-kan no Mebae\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e0d\u4fe1\u611f\u306e\u82bd\u751f\u3048\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|14}}\n| ShortSummary        = Lutz and Myne make their way through the wealthy side of town to Benno's office, amazed by the grandeur around them. They arrive at his building and have lunch with him, where he scolds them for going to Otto for nails and advice instead of himself. After Myne apologizes, Benno offers to create all the tools necessary to create the paper for the duo, but in exchange for the rights to Myne's shampoo. Myne agrees, but she also wants Lutz and herself to have all the rights to the paper once it becomes a profitable product, to which Benno agrees. They write out the order forms and sign a binding magical contract with Benno. On their way home, Lutz starts to become suspicious of who Myne is given the detailed discussion she had with Benno and how Lutz didn't understand any of it. Myne becomes increasingly anxious about giving herself away to those around her, and decides that if she's going to let the fever take her, it'll be after the completes her paper. She meets with Mark, Benno's assistant, to discuss a possible workshop stationed near the forest gate, but suddenly collapses. She awakens in Benno's home where he orders her to be accompanied by Lutz at all times when going out for work. After she heads home, Benno explains to Otto that the Devouring is manifested in commoner children who develop mana and rarely survive to their baptism. The next day, Myne and Lutz arrive at Benno's office where he says they have a workshop ready for them, but she is to do none of the heavy lifting.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| Title               = Lutz's Myne\n| TranslitTitle       = Ruttsu no Main\n| NativeTitle         = \u30eb\u30c3\u30c4\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|21}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne and Lutz arrive at their new workshop, and as they begin to put things in order, Myne is relieved to see Lutz acting normal towards her. Their first task is to create a bamboo strainer, but are not skilled enough to build it themselves. They delegate tasks between a lumberer to build tools and a craftsman to make the strainer, but after negotiating with them, Lutz again becomes suspicious of Myne's identity. Once their tools are ready, the pair venture out into the woods to extract tree fibers. While Lutz cuts down trees, Myne is suddenly attacked by a carnivorous weed known as a trombe, which will constantly grow and sprout even after it is cut down. Lutz calls his brothers and they eventually chop the trombe to pieces. Realizing its potential, Myne uses the scattered trombe twigs as her base and easily peels the fibers off. After planning the next steps, Lutz tells Myne that they need to talk after the paper is completed, causing her to worry. During each step of making the paper, Lutz becomes increasingly suspicious of Myne given how she seems to know what she is doing with no previous experience. After a few days of working, they finish the paper and Myne agrees to talk. She reveals she is not the Myne he once knew, and when he asks for her to return the original Myne, she says that if she does, all that will remain is a corpse. Myne adds that while she herself is not the cause of the fever, the fever itself led to the original's demise and that it is eating away at her as well. When Lutz starts to blame the new identity, Myne retorts claiming that she never wanted this and was given this fate when she died in her own world. She lets him decide whether or not to let her be taken by the fever since he was the one who saved her after her mother kept burning her ideas. Conflicted, Lutz asks how long she has been Myne, but figures out it was when she added the pin to her hair, nearly a year prior. He ultimately allows the new Myne to stay and chooses to let her family decide her fate since the current Myne is the one he mostly remembers at this point. They bring their paper prototypes to Benno, who after testing them, gives them a passing grade and allows them to be his apprentices.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 9\n| Title               = The Guild Master's Granddaughter \n| TranslitTitle       = Girudo-ch\u014d no Magomusume\n| NativeTitle         = \u30ae\u30eb\u30c9\u9577\u306e\u5b6b\u5a18\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|28}}\n| ShortSummary        = Benno and Mark teaches Myne and Lutz how the currency works in the world from small bronze coins to silver coins up to large gold coins before giving the pair their share for creating the paper. Myne asks how much her hair ornaments could be worth to sell commercially, deciding it to be their winter merchandise. Benno brings them to the Merchant Guild to meet the head executive Gustav, who he has a rivalry with. While they wait to be seen, Myne learns the layout of the town and the surrounding land to become more acquainted for the future. They meet with Gustav, who is initially against the unbaptized children becoming apprentices until they present him with the hair ornament. He relents and allows them to be registered in exchange for the ornament for his granddaughter's upcoming baptism. After deciding a price, Gustav attempts to ring in Myne to work for him instead of Benno, but she declines. After learning how much money Benno weaseled out of Gustav, Myne learns from him to always be searching for ways to increase your income. Lutz and Myne arrange to meet with Gustav's granddaughter Freida to present her with the ornament, to which she has wanted ever since she saw Tuuli wear one the previous year. Since Freida has pigtails for her hair, Myne offers to sell her two ornaments; one at full price and the second one at half price. Freida accepts, but believes Myne is missing out on profit, similar to what Benno told her earlier. Just like her grandfather, Freida attempts to ring in Myne to her family business, but Myne again declines. They present Freida with her ornaments and prepare to leave in case of Myne's sickness, but Freida asks if she has the Devouring. She explains that it is a fever-like illness that eats the host from the inside, and when Myne asks how she knows, Freida says she has it as well. When Myne asks how to cure it, Freida says it cannot be cured, but can only be contained with either expensive medicine or if the host has clear motivation and not become depressed. Myne thanks her for her advice and the pair prepares to leave.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| Title               = To the Second Winter\n| TranslitTitle       = Futatabime no Fuyu ni Mukete\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e8c\u5ea6\u76ee\u306e\u51ac\u306b\u5411\u3051\u3066\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|5}}\n| ShortSummary        = Hitting the one year mark since her arrival, Myne is bedridden while her family prepares for the fall festival again. As she lies in bed, she suddenly begins to feel the Devouring bubbling inside her, but quickly forces it down. Her family and Lutz return home with food from the festival and are glad to see her health returning. Myne and Lutz go over the training process for apprentices, which include etiquette, literacy, and the ability to perform calculations. The pair ask Benno how to look proper, who tells them to completely overhaul their wardrobe using the money they have accumulated so far. Benno then asks Myne for help with the shampoo-making process since production is not going well. She figures out the issue and when asked what to do with the unused oil they have made thus far, Myne says she will sell them as a different product for a jokingly high price, to which Benno shockingly accepts. When asked why, he tells her it is for her Devouring medication and that she should potentially be ready to sell everything she owns for it. Myne tells Benno everything he needs to know for the shampoo, causing him to ask her who she is and how she knows it all, but she refuses to say. The following day, Myne goes to the gate to practice writing words with Otto, but when he is called to deal with a trombe threat, the Devouring attempts to return again, forcing her to push it down. Later, as she and Lutz prepare the workshop for winter and set up bark hides to dry, but the Devouring appears a third time, forcing Myne to suppress it, worrying Lutz in the process. She explains it appears frequently nowadays, even when she is not disheartened, but the only real remedy is the expensive medicine. They return to Benno's office where Lutz begs him to save Myne since he himself cannot do anything for her. Benno retorts saying that he can help her by manning up and not giving her anything to worry about. Lutz asks Myne if she wants to sell any more of her homemade products, to which she agrees and brings Otto her weaving basket. They discuss other consumable products, when suddenly Myne begins to glow and collapses as the Devouring explodes inside her.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 11\n| Title               = Life-or-Death Choices and Family Meetings \n| TranslitTitle       = Ky\u016bkyoku no Sentaku to Kazoku Kaigi\n| NativeTitle         = \u7a76\u6975\u306e\u9078\u629e\u3068\u5bb6\u65cf\u4f1a\u8b70\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|12}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne awakens in Freida's bed and notices a shattered bracelet on her wrist. Freida walks in and tells her how the bracelet was a magical item that absorbs the Devouring fever, but that her illness will soon return within a year. When Myne asks where she can get more, Freida reveals that her family bought every faulty one in town and that the real bracelets are carried by nobles. Freida gives her an ultimatum: make a contract with the nobles and live but leave her family behind, or stay with her family and die. She also reveals that she has a contract to be a future concubine to a noble and is at peace with the decision. Myne thanks Gustav for saving her, but he tells her that the item she used is worth a large amount of money, which she agrees to pay thanks to her deals with Benno, surprising Gustav since he believed she could not and would be forced to work for him instead. Myne spends the rest of the day cooking sweets and playing with Freida before leaving with her family the following morning, who believe Myne is completely cured. She and Lutz arrive at Benno's office where he scolds her for cooking with sugar while she was with Freida since it is actually a rare commodity. Myne notices how busy Benno's shop is during the winter months and ponders making classic Japanese games to sell over the next year. That night at home, she presents her baptismal outfit to Gunther before telling her family the truth about the Devouring and her time limit.

Myne then meets with Freida, who is surprised and saddened by Myne's decision to stay with her family and die. Since she wants to accumulate enough money for her family to be happy before she goes, Myne agrees to sell all her recipes for cooking with sugar to Freida, who tearfully accepts. Soon after, Myne's baptismal day arrives, so she meets Lutz and parades down the main street with the other town's children toward the city temple. There, the children register for citizenship and learn about the religious history of their world. Afterwards, the clergy and children offer a prayer to the world's gods and goddesses, but the humorous poses required cause Myne to laugh hysterically, resulting in her being taken away under the guise of being ill. She awakens in an unknown room and proceeds to wander around the halls before stumbling across the temple library, but is unable to enter since only clergy are allowed. Myne meets with the High Bishop, who says that admission to work at the temple comes with a sizable donation. Myne offers one large gold coin, the highest currency, shocking him. He follows up by requiring her parent's approval, but agrees that even if they say no, she is welcome to come by and read anytime she wants.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 13\n| Title               = The Choice to be an Apprentice Priestess\n| TranslitTitle       = Miko Minarai to iu Sentakushi\n| NativeTitle         = \u5deb\u5973\u898b\u7fd2\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u9078\u629e\u80a2\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|26}}\n| ShortSummary        = Lutz scolds Myne as she rests in a temple bed for collapsing from excitement after finding out she can become a temple librarian. When she arrives home and tells her family about her plan, however, Gunther angrily refuses to allow her to go and convinces her that priestesses are for orphans that must stay at the church. As Myne comes to terms with this, the Devouring begins to bubble up inside her due to her inner turmoil of choosing between books and family. A few days later, Myne returns to the temple to turn down the offer and meets Ferdinand, the High Priest. Together, they read the religious scripture until the High Bishop arrives, who is puzzled by Myne's decision to refuse his offer. When she reveals she has the Devouring, the High Bishop frantically brings out a large golden grail. When Myne touches the goblet, it suddenly glows red, and the religious pair ask to meet with Myne's parents at a later date. Myne and Lutz then go to Benno, who demands Myne explain to him everything that happened at the temple. After she does, Benno reveals that she is strongly targeted by the church because they are short on mana due to a governmental conflict, and wish to use her Devouring as a sort of refuel in exchange for her desire of books. He also reveals that this will save her life, and recommends binding a magical contract with Lutz and Benno so she will be able to have contact with them while with the church. Myne registers at the guild to create a constant supply of income for her and Benno's profits, but on their way home, Lutz tearfully laments not being able to make books with Myne anymore.

She recalls to them how Benno advised to use any means necessary to improve her life and fight for her dreams, including the option to abuse her illness in order to be treated as a noble. Gunther agrees, but Tuuli and Effa are fearful of the potential consequences of negotiating with the temple nobility. Myne and her parents arrive at the church and meet with Ferdinand and the High Bishop, but when he realizes they aren't wealthy, the High Bishop's attitude suddenly becomes condescending and arrogant. After refusing to give Myne to the church without having their demands met, Myne's parents are attacked by the temple's guards and Myne is to be taken by force. As Gunther is about to be overwhelmed, Myne begins to glow and attacks the High Bishop with a semi-psychic power. She knocks him unconscious, but as she goes in for the kill, Ferdinand stands in her way and calms her down. Ferdinand apologizes for not stopping the High Bishop's aggression and brings the family to his room for discussions. There, he explains that Myne's sudden explosion of power is called the \"Crushing\" and occurs when the host of the Devouring lets their emotions overwhelm them. When asked why she isn't already dead, Myne says she used a broken magical item to stay alive, but refused to form a contract with a noble since it would deprive her of her way of life. Moved by her words, Ferdinand agrees to the family's conditions and allows Myne to become a member of the church with full benefits.

On the way home, Myne hears about a strange man looking for her and is told to be cautious. That night, Gunther meets with Otto to discuss their future, only for Otto to reveal he's been offered a position by Benno to help support his newborn child. The next day, Benno reveals that someone broke into the Merchant Guild, and the suspect is most likely a spy from the temple who's looking for Myne. He also finds out that Freida bought Myne's recipe for cooking with sugar, much to his chagrin due to a lack of supplies and accessibility, but plans to make her a future offer. At the temple, Ferdinand reports his spy's findings to the High Bishop, promoting her potential high value, but the High Bishop counters with plans to abuse Myne for her mana.

High Priest, puts a young girl named Myne into a deep sleep and probes her mind regarding her past and her abnormal love for books. He sees that Myne used to be known as Motosu Urano from another land and time. She loved every kind of literature in existence, but she was suddenly crushed to death under a pile of books. As she died, she wished that she would be able to read all kinds of books in her next life. She hears a small voice crying out in pain before awakening in the body of the young girl named Myne who is bedridden due to a fever. Confused about her surroundings, she asks her new mother, Effa, and elder sister, Tuuli, where she can find books to read, but they don't seem to understand. When they leave to prepare dinner, Myne searches the house, but finds out it is only a small wooden cabin with no books in sight, or even any paper, causing her to cry. After a few days, the only convenience Myne can find is by putting a pin in her long hair to keep it up, which surprises Tuuli. When Effa asks Myne to accompany her to the food market, she agrees, believing it to be a way to find books outside her home. Looking around town, she realizes that she lives in the slightly impoverished side of a classic medieval town, as well as that her father, Gunther, is a guard along the town border. When they reach the market, Myne finds a single book enclosed in a locked glass case at a stall. She asks the owner if she can see it, but the man tells her that books are rare and only nobles are allowed to handle them. Undeterred, Myne says that if she cannot buy books anywhere, she will have to make them herself.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Life Improvements and Slates \n| TranslitTitle       = Seikatsu kaizen to Sekiban\n| NativeTitle         = \u751f\u6d3b\u6539\u5584\u3068\u77f3\u677f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|10}}\n| ShortSummary        = Irritated by her ragged and itchy hair, Myne takes a fruit that Tuuli bought at the market and extracts its oil, creating a basic shampoo that cleans her hair, shocking both Effa and Tuuli. The next day, Gunther forgets a package at home, so Myne and Tuuli attempt to make the trek to his stationed gate to bring it to him. Outside their townhouse door, they meet Lutz, Ralph, and Fey, a family trio of boys who also live in the neighborhood. Exhausted from the walk outside, Myne collapses and is given a ride on Ralph's back to the gate, to Lutz's slight disappointment. Along the way, Myne is able to determine Ralph's feelings for Tuuli, as well as Lutz's possible feelings for herself. They reach the gate and deliver the package to Gunther, where the boys then split off to go cut wood in the forest. Gunter introduces Myne and Tuuli to his partner Otto, who suddenly pulls out a scroll made of animal hide. Intrigued, Myne asks her father to buy parchment for her, but is declined when he tells her she cannot read or write, as well its high cost. Otto offers to teach Myne to read and write on a small chalkboard-like slate, to which she then happily agrees, surprising Gunther with slight jealousy. The season begins to cool, halting Myne's progress as she helps her family pack for the town's fall festival. The family travels to the festival location where Myne is forced to sit off to the side due to her frailty. She ponders how writing had advanced through civilizations and comes up with the idea of weaving fiber-like papyrus as a paper substitute, similar to what ancient Egyptians did. Before she can plan this out, she faints when she sees a pig slaughtered up close, causing Gunther to bring her back to the gate to Otto. After she wakes, Otto hands her the slate and writes her name for her in the new language so she can practice. As she practices, he begins to subconsciously write in Japanese and writes down the names of everyone she has met thus far. When Otto returns, he finds Myne passed out from a fever and rushes her home. That night, she encourages herself on her progress with writing before wondering what great idea she had before she suddenly fainted at the festival.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = The Events of Winter\n| TranslitTitle       = Fuyu no Dekigoto\n| NativeTitle         = \u51ac\u306e\u3067\u304d\u3054\u3068\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|17}}\n| ShortSummary        = Two months after Myne's consciousness came to the new world, winter struck the town hard and buried it in snow. Since every day is spent indoors, Myne attempts to shave the fibers off of twigs to weave into a pseudo-papyrus paper. After three days of working and weaving, she hardly gets a single corner completed before giving up in frustration at her slow progress. Effa comes up with an idea for Myne to help weave baskets, to which Myne has prior knowledge of how to make from when she was back in Japan. Myne makes her basket with ease and surprises Tuuli and Effa with its efficiency, though Tuuli gets upset since she wants to become an apprentice seamstress and Myne appears to be better than her. Effa offers to teach Tuuli how to weave up to her 7th birthday, which is when the town's children become baptized and choose a profession. Effa tries to ring Myne in as well, but she politely declines in favor of her next goal, which is waiting until spring to make clay tablets similar to those of ancient Mesopotamia. The next morning, Tuuli and Gunther go and pick parues, which are fruit from completely iced-over trees. The fruit can be used as both a drinkable juice and a type of bird feed, but after accidentally tasting the feed and finding it edible, Myne figures out how to turn it into a type of pancake, which her family and the neighbor boys enjoy. That night, Effa and Tuuli begin to question where Myne is getting her ideas from, but Gunther says he prefers this Myne over a sad and sick one. At the same time, Myne's slate pencil wears itself out, so she asks Gunther to take her to the gate to get it replaced, much to his chagrin. He drops Myne off the next day, and Otto gives Myne a new pencil to work with. As Otto begins his work, Myne corrects him on a few calculations, surprising him. He asks her to help out, to which she agrees in exchange for a constant supply of slate pencils. That night, while Tuuli has a dress prepared for her upcoming baptism, Myne decides to create a hair ornament for her to look her best.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = Forests and Clay Tablets \n| TranslitTitle       = Hajimete no Mori to Nendo ban\n| NativeTitle         = \u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u68ee\u3068\u7c98\u571f\u677f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|24}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne decides to cook dinner for the family and, using cooking tactics from Japan, surprises them on how good it is. Gunther and Effa decide on whether to show Myne to a cooking apprentice, but she heartily declines, stating she wants to go to the forest in search of clay. Her family eventually dissuade her, claiming she is not strong enough to go to the forest and that she needs to build up her strength first. Later on, Gunther tells Myne that Otto has asked for her to be his calculations assistant, though it is unofficial since unbaptized children cannot work. She arrives at the gate to see Otto teaching a class of older kids how to write, and while it was awkward to start, the class warms up to Myne and eventually begin learning from her. After the students leave, Otto rewards her by teaching her how to write complete words. While she frequently got sick near the beginning, Myne eventually builds up her stamina enough to go to the forest, but ends up getting sick the day she was supposed to go. Once spring ended, Myne finally was able to go into the forest with Lutz's family and Tuuli. She begins digging for clay, but is caught by Lutz, who after scolding her for not resting, helps her find the right spots to dig. They find a hot spot for clay, allowing Myne to collect and flatten them out into many individual tablets to write on. Myne completes a story Effa tells her when she is sick onto the tablets and leaves them out to dry, but Lutz's brothers crush them, believing them to be cushions. Heartbroken, Myne begins to mysteriously glow as she shouts and berates the boys, before Lutz arrives and calms her down. As she sadly begins digging again, Lutz orders the boys to help her as penance. They are able to recreate the tablets, but they are washed away in the rain the next day. As they build the clay book for a third time, Lutz and Myne exchange their dreams for the future; Lutz to be a traveling merchant and Myne a librarian. They complete the tablets and Myne brings them home to harden in the fireplace, but they instantly shatter, causing Myne to shout in frustration.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Baptisms and Strange Fevers \n| TranslitTitle       = Senreishiki to Fushigina Netsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u6d17\u793c\u5f0f\u3068\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u71b1\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|31}}\n| ShortSummary        = Tuuli's baptism day arrives and her hair ornament is the talk of the neighborhood. Though he wants to stay and watch the parade, Gunther is forced to work, so he brings Myne with him to the gate. While there, a messenger arrives while Otto is away, but Myne offers to read and deliver the message to Otto, surprising the messenger. That night, as Tuuli tells everyone about her day, Gunther presents with her a sewing kit as a gift. He also gives Myne a knife and tells her that she will now be the house helper instead. However, she comes up with the idea to carve tree bark into wooden planks to write on, similar to that of ancient China. The next day, she goes into the forest with Lutz and begins carving her planks, but to low success. Lutz decides to help, but in exchange for an opportunity to meet Otto in regards to being a traveling merchant. Myne asks Otto about the traveling trade, but Otto states that it isn't a good profession for a city child, although he agrees to talk with Lutz about it. Myne collects all the planks and brings them to her family storage room to dry. She then thinks about what to write with and comes up with the idea to use soot. Mixing soot with clay, Myne creates a basic black pencil to use to write on the planks, but when she arrives home, the planks are gone and Effa is revealed to have used them for firewood. Distraught, Myne begins to mysteriously glow again, but suddenly collapses with a terrible fever. Lutz arrives and cheers Myne up, telling her to keep moving forward. While she stays in bed, Lutz brings her bamboo strips to work on, but Effa burns them as well, believing them to be more kindling for the fire. Myne starts to glow again and contemplates giving up entirely, but the thought of Lutz helping her persuades her to keep trying. As she calms down, her fever does also, begging her to question what sort of sickness her body really has. Once she's healed, Myne meets with Otto and they plan a day for Lutz and Otto to meet.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| Title               = Meeting\n| TranslitTitle       = Kaigo\n| NativeTitle         = \u4f1a\u5408\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|7}}\n| ShortSummary        = Before their meeting with Otto, Myne decides to wash Lutz's hair with her shampoo so he can look his best. Afterwards, she asks why he wants to be a traveling merchant, but he responds with his own questions regarding what she wants to do. She reveals that she's changed her goal from selling books to selling paper, hinting that she wants his help. The meeting day arrives, but Otto shows up with an old partner named Benno, a town merchant and former traveling trader. Benno becomes immediately interested in children's clean hair and Myne's hair pin, but she says the details are a secret. Otto deters Lutz from becoming a traveling merchant on the ground of losing one's citizenship, meaning they cannot reside in any town or have any sort of luxury. Coming to terms with this, Lutz chooses to help Myne make paper and sell it. Myne reveals her idea for making paper from plants and selling them for profit, though Benno questions its authenticity. Myne promises a prototype before her baptism and Benno agrees to sponsor her if it comes true. Myne goes over what tools she needs and asks Lutz to find a suitable tree to use to extract its fibers. Otto offers to give Myne nails to use to build her tools in exchange for the use of her shampoo for his wife. She agrees and meets his wife Corinna, an executive in the Seamstress Guild and Benno's sister, and washes her hair for the nails. Myne and Lutz try to build their tools, but can't get the exact proportions quite right. At the gate, Otto gives Myne and Lutz invitations from Benno to meet with him, when suddenly Otto remembers from their meeting that Benno believes Myne's illness is called the \"Devouring\" and is fatal.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| Title               = Seeds of Suspicion\n| TranslitTitle       = Fushin-kan no Mebae\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e0d\u4fe1\u611f\u306e\u82bd\u751f\u3048\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|14}}\n| ShortSummary        = Lutz and Myne make their way through the wealthy side of town to Benno's office, amazed by the grandeur around them. They arrive at his building and have lunch with him, where he scolds them for going to Otto for nails and advice instead of himself. After Myne apologizes, Benno offers to create all the tools necessary to create the paper for the duo, but in exchange for the rights to Myne's shampoo. Myne agrees, but she also wants Lutz and herself to have all the rights to the paper once it becomes a profitable product, to which Benno agrees. They write out the order forms and sign a binding magical contract with Benno. On their way home, Lutz starts to become suspicious of who Myne is given the detailed discussion she had with Benno and how Lutz didn't understand any of it. Myne becomes increasingly anxious about giving herself away to those around her, and decides that if she's going to let the fever take her, it'll be after the completes her paper. She meets with Mark, Benno's assistant, to discuss a possible workshop stationed near the forest gate, but suddenly collapses. She awakens in Benno's home where he orders her to be accompanied by Lutz at all times when going out for work. After she heads home, Benno explains to Otto that the Devouring is manifested in commoner children who develop mana and rarely survive to their baptism. The next day, Myne and Lutz arrive at Benno's office where he says they have a workshop ready for them, but she is to do none of the heavy lifting.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| Title               = Lutz's Myne\n| TranslitTitle       = Ruttsu no Main\n| NativeTitle         = \u30eb\u30c3\u30c4\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|21}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne and Lutz arrive at their new workshop, and as they begin to put things in order, Myne is relieved to see Lutz acting normal towards her. Their first task is to create a bamboo strainer, but are not skilled enough to build it themselves. They delegate tasks between a lumberer to build tools and a craftsman to make the strainer, but after negotiating with them, Lutz again becomes suspicious of Myne's identity. Once their tools are ready, the pair venture out into the woods to extract tree fibers. While Lutz cuts down trees, Myne is suddenly attacked by a carnivorous weed known as a trombe, which will constantly grow and sprout even after it is cut down. Lutz calls his brothers and they eventually chop the trombe to pieces. Realizing its potential, Myne uses the scattered trombe twigs as her base and easily peels the fibers off. After planning the next steps, Lutz tells Myne that they need to talk after the paper is completed, causing her to worry. During each step of making the paper, Lutz becomes increasingly suspicious of Myne given how she seems to know what she is doing with no previous experience. After a few days of working, they finish the paper and Myne agrees to talk. She reveals she is not the Myne he once knew, and when he asks for her to return the original Myne, she says that if she does, all that will remain is a corpse. Myne adds that while she herself is not the cause of the fever, the fever itself led to the original's demise and that it is eating away at her as well. When Lutz starts to blame the new identity, Myne retorts claiming that she never wanted this and was given this fate when she died in her own world. She lets him decide whether or not to let her be taken by the fever since he was the one who saved her after her mother kept burning her ideas. Conflicted, Lutz asks how long she has been Myne, but figures out it was when she added the pin to her hair, nearly a year prior. He ultimately allows the new Myne to stay and chooses to let her family decide her fate since the current Myne is the one he mostly remembers at this point. They bring their paper prototypes to Benno, who after testing them, gives them a passing grade and allows them to be his apprentices.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 9\n| Title               = The Guild Master's Granddaughter \n| TranslitTitle       = Girudo-ch\u014d no Magomusume\n| NativeTitle         = \u30ae\u30eb\u30c9\u9577\u306e\u5b6b\u5a18\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|28}}\n| ShortSummary        = Benno and Mark teaches Myne and Lutz how the currency works in the world from small bronze coins to silver coins up to large gold coins before giving the pair their share for creating the paper. Myne asks how much her hair ornaments could be worth to sell commercially, deciding it to be their winter merchandise. Benno brings them to the Merchant Guild to meet the head executive Gustav, who he has a rivalry with. While they wait to be seen, Myne learns the layout of the town and the surrounding land to become more acquainted for the future. They meet with Gustav, who is initially against the unbaptized children becoming apprentices until they present him with the hair ornament. He relents and allows them to be registered in exchange for the ornament for his granddaughter's upcoming baptism. After deciding a price, Gustav attempts to ring in Myne to work for him instead of Benno, but she declines. After learning how much money Benno weaseled out of Gustav, Myne learns from him to always be searching for ways to increase your income. Lutz and Myne arrange to meet with Gustav's granddaughter Freida to present her with the ornament, to which she has wanted ever since she saw Tuuli wear one the previous year. Since Freida has pigtails for her hair, Myne offers to sell her two ornaments; one at full price and the second one at half price. Freida accepts, but believes Myne is missing out on profit, similar to what Benno told her earlier. Just like her grandfather, Freida attempts to ring in Myne to her family business, but Myne again declines. They present Freida with her ornaments and prepare to leave in case of Myne's sickness, but Freida asks if she has the Devouring. She explains that it is a fever-like illness that eats the host from the inside, and when Myne asks how she knows, Freida says she has it as well. When Myne asks how to cure it, Freida says it cannot be cured, but can only be contained with either expensive medicine or if the host has clear motivation and not become depressed. Myne thanks her for her advice and the pair prepares to leave.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| Title               = To the Second Winter\n| TranslitTitle       = Futatabime no Fuyu ni Mukete\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e8c\u5ea6\u76ee\u306e\u51ac\u306b\u5411\u3051\u3066\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|5}}\n| ShortSummary        = Hitting the one year mark since her arrival, Myne is bedridden while her family prepares for the fall festival again.

Her family and Lutz return home with food from the festival and are glad to see her health returning. Myne and Lutz go over the training process for apprentices, which include etiquette, literacy, and the ability to perform calculations. The pair ask Benno how to look proper, who tells them to completely overhaul their wardrobe using the money they have accumulated so far. Benno then asks Myne for help with the shampoo-making process since production is not going well. She figures out the issue and when asked what to do with the unused oil they have made thus far, Myne says she will sell them as a different product for a jokingly high price, to which Benno shockingly accepts. When asked why, he tells her it is for her Devouring medication and that she should potentially be ready to sell everything she owns for it. Myne tells Benno everything he needs to know for the shampoo, causing him to ask her who she is and how she knows it all, but she refuses to say. The following day, Myne goes to the gate to practice writing words with Otto, but when he is called to deal with a trombe threat, the Devouring attempts to return again, forcing her to push it down. Later, as she and Lutz prepare the workshop for winter and set up bark hides to dry, but the Devouring appears a third time, forcing Myne to suppress it, worrying Lutz in the process. She explains it appears frequently nowadays, even when she is not disheartened, but the only real remedy is the expensive medicine. They return to Benno's office where Lutz begs him to save Myne since he himself cannot do anything for her. Benno retorts saying that he can help her by manning up and not giving her anything to worry about. Lutz asks Myne if she wants to sell any more of her homemade products, to which she agrees and brings Otto her weaving basket. They discuss other consumable products, when suddenly Myne begins to glow and collapses as the Devouring explodes inside her.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 11\n| Title               = Life-or-Death Choices and Family Meetings \n| TranslitTitle       = Ky\u016bkyoku no Sentaku to Kazoku Kaigi\n| NativeTitle         = \u7a76\u6975\u306e\u9078\u629e\u3068\u5bb6\u65cf\u4f1a\u8b70\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|12}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne awakens in Freida's bed and notices a shattered bracelet on her wrist. Freida walks in and tells her how the bracelet was a magical item that absorbs the Devouring fever, but that her illness will soon return within a year. When Myne asks where she can get more, Freida reveals that her family bought every faulty one in town and that the real bracelets are carried by nobles. Freida gives her an ultimatum: make a contract with the nobles and live but leave her family behind, or stay with her family and die. She also reveals that she has a contract to be a future concubine to a noble and is at peace with the decision. Myne thanks Gustav for saving her, but he tells her that the item she used is worth a large amount of money, which she agrees to pay thanks to her deals with Benno, surprising Gustav since he believed she could not and would be forced to work for him instead. Myne spends the rest of the day cooking sweets and playing with Freida before leaving with her family the following morning, who believe Myne is completely cured. She and Lutz arrive at Benno's office where he scolds her for cooking with sugar while she was with Freida since it is actually a rare commodity. Myne notices how busy Benno's shop is during the winter months and ponders making classic Japanese games to sell over the next year. That night at home, she presents her baptismal outfit to Gunther before telling her family the truth about the Devouring and her time limit. After discussing the option of moving in among the nobles with her family, she decides to stay with her family with the time she has left.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 12\n| Title               = Baptism and Divine Paradises\n| TranslitTitle       = Senrei shiki to Kami no Rakuen\n| NativeTitle         = \u6d17\u793c\u5f0f\u3068\u795e\u306e\u697d\u5712\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = As the seasons begin to warm, Myne arranges to end her apprenticeship with Benno and sells the rights of the paper-making process to him. Lutz decides to continue his apprenticeship as a merchant under Benno after convincing his mother that he won't follow the family trade into craftsmanship. Myne then meets with Freida, who is surprised and saddened by Myne's decision to stay with her family and die. Since she wants to accumulate enough money for her family to be happy before she goes, Myne agrees to sell all her recipes for cooking with sugar to Freida, who tearfully accepts. Soon after, Myne's baptismal day arrives, so she meets Lutz and parades down the main street with the other town's children toward the city temple. There, the children register for citizenship and learn about the religious history of their world. Afterwards, the clergy and children offer a prayer to the world's gods and goddesses, but the humorous poses required cause Myne to laugh hysterically, resulting in her being taken away under the guise of being ill. She awakens in an unknown room and proceeds to wander around the halls before stumbling across the temple library, but is unable to enter since only clergy are allowed. Myne meets with the High Bishop, who says that admission to work at the temple comes with a sizable donation. Myne offers one large gold coin, the highest currency, shocking him. He follows up by requiring her parent's approval, but agrees that even if they say no, she is welcome to come by and read anytime she wants.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 13\n| Title               = The Choice to be an Apprentice Priestess\n| TranslitTitle       = Miko Minarai to iu Sentakushi\n| NativeTitle         = \u5deb\u5973\u898b\u7fd2\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u9078\u629e\u80a2\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|26}}\n| ShortSummary        = Lutz scolds Myne as she rests in a temple bed for collapsing from excitement after finding out she can become a temple librarian. When she arrives home and tells her family about her plan, however, Gunther angrily refuses to allow her to go and convinces her that priestesses are for orphans that must stay at the church. As Myne comes to terms with this, the Devouring begins to bubble up inside her due to her inner turmoil of choosing between books and family. A few days later, Myne returns to the temple to turn down the offer and meets Ferdinand, the High Priest. Together, they read the religious scripture until the High Bishop arrives, who is puzzled by Myne's decision to refuse his offer. When she reveals she has the Devouring, the High Bishop frantically brings out a large golden grail. When Myne touches the goblet, it suddenly glows red, and the religious pair ask to meet with Myne's parents at a later date. Myne and Lutz then go to Benno, who demands Myne explain to him everything that happened at the temple. After she does, Benno reveals that she is strongly targeted by the church because they are short on mana due to a governmental conflict, and wish to use her Devouring as a sort of refuel in exchange for her desire of books. He also reveals that this will save her life, and recommends binding a magical contract with Lutz and Benno so she will be able to have contact with them while with the church. Myne registers at the guild to create a constant supply of income for her and Benno's profits, but on their way home, Lutz tearfully laments not being able to make books with Myne anymore. Myne apologizes, but retorts that he will always be her first choice if she ever has a problem and claims to still desire to make her own books with his help.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14\n| Title               = Conclusions\n| TranslitTitle       = Ketchaku\n| NativeTitle         = \u6c7a\u7740\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|26}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne tells her parents about the meeting with the temple clergy regarding her apprenticeship, and also reveals how she would live as a noble in exchange for her Devouring to fuel the church's mana supply. She recalls to them how Benno advised to use any means necessary to improve her life and fight for her dreams, including the option to abuse her illness in order to be treated as a noble. Gunther agrees, but Tuuli and Effa are fearful of the potential consequences of negotiating with the temple nobility. Myne and her parents arrive at the church and meet with Ferdinand and the High Bishop, but when he realizes they aren't wealthy, the High Bishop's attitude suddenly becomes condescending and arrogant. After refusing to give Myne to the church without having their demands met, Myne's parents are attacked by the temple's guards and Myne is to be taken by force. As Gunther is about to be overwhelmed, Myne begins to glow and attacks the High Bishop with a semi-psychic power. She knocks him unconscious, but as she goes in for the kill, Ferdinand stands in her way and calms her down. Ferdinand apologizes for not stopping the High Bishop's aggression and brings the family to his room for discussions. There, he explains that Myne's sudden explosion of power is called the \"Crushing\" and occurs when the host of the Devouring lets their emotions overwhelm them. When asked why she isn't already dead, Myne says she used a broken magical item to stay alive, but refused to form a contract with a noble since it would deprive her of her way of life. Moved by her words, Ferdinand agrees to the family's conditions and allows Myne to become a member of the church with full benefits. Myne returns home to Lutz and Tuuli and tearfully hugs them with joy.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|p=Side Stories (OVA)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://booklove-anime.jp/news/258 |title=TV\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u300c\u672c\u597d\u304d\u306e\u4e0b\u524b\u4e0a \u53f8\u66f8\u306b\u306a\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u306f\u624b\u6bb5\u3092\u9078\u3093\u3067\u3044\u3089\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u300d\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |language=Japanese |publisher=\u00a9\u9999\u6708\u7f8e\u591c\u30fbTO\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\uff0f\u672c\u597d\u304d\u306e\u4e0b\u524b\u4e0a\u88fd\u4f5c\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a |access-date=March 22, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{efn|name=etc}}|c=#79A3DD|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14.5P1\n| Title               = Side Story One: Eustachius's Incognito Operation Downtown\n| TranslitTitle       = Yusutokusu no Shitamachi Sen'ny\u016b Dai Sakusen\n| NativeTitle         = \u30e6\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u4e0b\u753a\u6f5c\u5165\u5927\u4f5c\u6226\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|3|10}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14.5P2\n| Title               = Side Story Two: Visiting Missus Corinna\n| TranslitTitle       = Korin'na-sama no Otaku H\u014dmon\n| NativeTitle         = \u30b3\u30ea\u30f3\u30ca\u69d8\u306e\u304a\u5b85\u8a2a\u554f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|3|10}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n}}\n\n===Part 2 (2020)===\n{{Episode table\n|total_width= 98\n|background= #79A3DD\n|overall= \n|title= \n|titleR= <ref>{{cite web|url=http://booklove-anime.jp/story/|title=\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc|accessdate=October 2, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>{{efn|name=etc}}\n|airdate= \n|airdateR= \n|episodes= \n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 15\n| Title               = Apprentice Priestess\n| TranslitTitle       = Shinden no Miko Minarai\n| NativeTitle         = \u795e\u6bbf\u306e\u5deb\u5973\u898b\u7fd2\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|4}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne returns to Benno's shop to tell him the news of her apprenticeship, only to find Lutz working as an assistant as part of his apprenticeship.

On the way home, Myne hears about a strange man looking for her and is told to be cautious. That night, Gunther meets with Otto to discuss their future, only for Otto to reveal he's been offered a position by Benno to help support his newborn child. The next day, Benno reveals that someone broke into the Merchant Guild, and the suspect is most likely a spy from the temple who's looking for Myne. He also finds out that Freida bought Myne's recipe for cooking with sugar, much to his chagrin due to a lack of supplies and accessibility, but plans to make her a future offer. At the temple, Ferdinand reports his spy's findings to the High Bishop, promoting her potential high value, but the High Bishop counters with plans to abuse Myne for her mana. The day of Myne's inauguration arrives, but as she walks the halls of the temple, she hears derogatory commoner remarks aimed in her direction. She meets with Ferdinand, recites the prayer to be an apprentice, and is handed her blue robes, the sign of clergy coming from a noble family. She then meets her three attendants, called \"retainers\". She meets a quiet young man named Fran, a conceited young girl named Delia, and a pompous young boy named Gil, all who wear gray-robed uniforms, indicating the lowest level member of the temple. When Ferdinand is called away, it is determined that, while Gil is brash and Fran is devoted to the temple, Delia out secretly out to get Myne, per the High Boshop's orders.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 16\n| Title               = Blue Robes and Uncommon Sense\n| TranslitTitle       = Aoi I to Kotonaru J\u014dshiki\n| NativeTitle         = \u9752\u3044\u8863\u3068\u7570\u306a\u308b\u5e38\u8b58\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|11}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}<!--\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 17\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = Ataerubeki Mono\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u3079\u304d\u3082\u306e\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|18}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = \n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = \n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}-->\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

Bloch became ill on the plane and was taken to a hospital in [[Kampala]]; she was not rescued with the other hostages during [[Operation Entebbe]], but went missing from the hospital. Her disappearance led to Britain cutting diplomatic ties with Uganda. Her body was discovered in 1979 in a sugar plantation near the capital.

Unlike other American cities, which grew outward from a historical core and only later acquired [[suburb]]s, Los Angeles had started as a series of suburbs, with small communities such as [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[Whittier, California|Whittier]] and [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] starting up in the late 19th century.<ref name=\"KCET story\" /> Recounting how the efforts of developers like [[Henry E. Huntington]] and [[Harry Chandler]] and the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power|water supply system]] developed by [[William Mulholland]] shaped the city, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' later said \"Builders, more than planners, facilitated the city's growth spurts, driven by one singular vision: Los Angeles would be a city of small houses on small lots.\"<ref name=\"LAT future article\">{{cite news|last=Curwen|first=Thomas|title=High-rises or bungalows?

High-rise development remained largely confined to [[Downtown Los Angeles|downtown]], with newly settled areas retaining the small-scale suburban feel that had distinguished the city's earlier days, resulting in \"an ethnically diverse and complex metropolis in which no single economic or cultural center dominates a region that is neither conventionally suburban in character nor fully urban.\"<ref name=\"KCET story\" />\n\nThe city first established a [[zoning in the United States|zoning]] code in 1921. By the end of [[Los Angeles in the 1920s|the decade]] complaints that [[political corruption in the United States|political corruption]] was leading to [[spot zoning]], or single-property changes to use, for commercial establishments, undermining the purpose of the zoning code, were already abundant; they continued even as the real estate market slowed in the [[Great Depression]]. After the war, with federal housing subsidies driving construction, zoning was often changed when actual uses differed; most of the farms of the [[San Fernando Valley]] disappeared by the 1960s to make way for residential development. Neighborhood [[homeowners' associations]] gained political power through opposing spot zoning; by the end of the decade, public outrage over a developer's [[indictment]] for bribing officials to get a favorable zoning change led to amendments to the [[city charter]] forbidding spot zoning.<ref name=\"Zoning history journal article\">{{cite journal|last1=Whittemore|first1=Andrew H.|title=Zoning Los Angeles: A Brief History of Four Regimes|journal=[[Planning Perspectives]]|date=July 2012|volume=27|issue=3|pages=393\u2013415|doi=10.1080/02665433.2012.681140|url=http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab3/archive/files/6f25f28dc353909147454ee30c6ef581.pdf|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:LosAngeles from Observatory.JPG|thumb|left|Historically, high-rise development in Los Angeles has been confined to downtown.|alt=A small area of skyscrapers amid a larger, flatter yet extensively developed area]]\nIn the late 1970s, following the enactment of [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]], which capped [[property tax]] assessments until the property changed owners, Los Angeles residents began advocating for [[Smart growth|slow growth]] and neighborhood preservation.

It cited a 2015 report from the city's housing department to Garcetti, warning that a large majority of Los Angeles's new housing over the preceding decade was for households earning $105,000 a year or more, far more than needed for that end of the market, yet despite that there was still a 12% vacancy rate.

Since California's [[Ellis Act]], under which landlords can evict tenants if they are no longer offering the units for rent, was state law beyond the scope of city ballot initiatives, Measure S could not address them directly. Supporters claimed instead that its provisions would drive down the number of evictions by making it harder to build the kind of housing for which tenants were evicted.<ref name=\"LAT evictions story\">{{cite news|last1=Khouri|first1=Andrew|last2=Poston|first2=Ben|title=The luxury housing that Measure S would stop doesn't actually require many evictions|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-measure-s-rent-control-20170124-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 24, 2017|accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the ''Times'' found that many of the developments for which rent-controlled tenants had been evicted had not needed the spot zoning the measure intended to stop in order to be built; one such project had been one from which an [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]] woman featured in one of the pro-S campaign advertisements was evicted. Fewer than 10% of all the evictions of rent-controlled tenants between 2011\u20132015 had been for projects that would have been affected by the proposed moratorium, the paper found. Miki Jackson, a spokeswoman for the supporters said that they were concerned about the \"enormous ripple effect\" spot zoned projects have, since they lead to [[gentrification]] and more Ellis Act evictions. She acknowledged, however, that the 22,000 evictions were the ''total'' Ellis Act evictions since 2000, not just those triggered by spot zoning.<ref name=\"LAT evictions story\" />\n\nOpponents argued that preventing spot zoning temporarily would actually increase Ellis Act evictions during that time. Most spot zoned projects were proposed for sites on which no housing had previously existed, they noted. If [[land development|developers]] could not build on those, they would turn instead to remodeling and rebuilding housing in older neighborhoods, with more rent controlled tenants subject to Ellis Act eviction. \"[It] will leave in place the options that removed the most housing,\" said Josh Kamensky, a spokesman for the CPLANJ.<ref name=\"LAT evictions story\" />\n\n===Alleged corrupt influence on planning process===\n\nAs proof that the city government had been corrupted to the point of needing the drastic steps the initiative would take, supporters began touting<ref name=\"CPLA FAQs page\" /> a lengthy October 2016 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article. It described Sea Breeze, a [[Torrance, California|Torrance]]-area apartment project, that was approved for construction despite its proximity to several industrial sites that could adversely affect the quality of life for residents. The newspaper found that large campaign contributions to mayor [[Eric Garcetti]] and key city council members including [[Janice Hahn]], later elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]], came from individuals of modest means who worked for companies connected to the project's developer, although those contributors did not recall writing checks for amounts they admitted were equal to what they earned in weeks or even months (many of which also appeared to be written by the same person regardless of whose account they were drawn on). In some cases the purported contributors were not even [[voter registration|registered to vote]]. The city's planning commission had twice unanimously rejected Sea Breeze, only to be overruled by city council. To facilitate one of those votes, Garcetti had invoked a rarely used mayoral power to temporarily reduce the number of votes necessary for passage.<ref name=\"Sea Breeze\">{{cite news|last1=Zahnhiser|first1=David|last2=Reyes|first2=Emily Alpert|title=A $72-million apartment project.

While Measure S supporters approved of the effort, many thought it made their points about how necessary the initiative was. \"It's an admission of guilt\", said Sherman Oaks Homeowners Association (SOHA) president Richard Close, a supporter.<ref name=\"LAT contribution ban article\">{{cite news|last1=Zahnhiser|first1=David|last2=Reyes|first2=Emily Alpert|title=L.A. politicians propose banning campaign contributions from developers|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-contributions-ban-20170110-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 10, 2017|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Possible effects of moratorium===\n\nThe practical effect of the moratorium was another point of disagreement between the two sides. Supporters repeatedly stated that only 5% of development in the city would be halted by it, and that it would only last two years.<ref name=\"CPLA FAQs page\" /> Opponents responded that both claims were misleading. The 5% figure was based, they said, on an apparent analysis of all [[Planning permission|permits]]; however, they implied, most of the construction that would be allowed was improvements to existing buildings or very small-scale housing, and the 5% of blocked projects included most of the larger multi-unit proposals seeking approval.<ref name=\"CPLANJ Fact Check page\" /><ref name=\"Abundant Housing LA page\" /> And due to the initiative's requirement that the city update its entire zoning, a process which could take longer than two years, opponents estimated it could be as long as ten years before developers felt comfortable building again.<ref name=\"CPLANJ Fact Check page\" />\n\nOpponents also disputed supporters' claims that Measure S would not affect any plans for [[affordable housing]]. Instead, they claimed, 90% of those projects would not be able to built since they would require the sort of variances the initiative would forbid for projects on those scales.<ref name=\"CPLANJ Fact Check page\" /> One cartographer identified city-owned [[parking lot]]s on which 724 units could be built, but only if the General Plan, which currently allowed only industrial use on the property, were amended, something the measure would forbid even for projects of entirely affordable housing.<ref name=\"Urbanize LA post\">{{cite news|last=Sharp|first=Stephen|title=Proposed Ballot Measure Would Prevent Homeless Housing on City-Owned Sites|url=http://urbanize.la/post/proposed-ballot-measure-would-prevent-homeless-housing-city-owned-sites|newspaper=Urbanize.LA|date=January 17, 2017|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}</ref> They also dismissed the exemption for such projects, saying that was \"yet another example of 60 year old solutions to today's problems\", in the CPLANJ's words.<ref name=\"CPLANJ Fact Check page\" />\n\nRichard Platkin, a former city planner who strongly supported Measure S, wrote that these arguments were specious. \"For nearly an entire year\", he wrote in a January 2017 ''City Watch LA'' column, \"I have repeatedly asked ... readers to identify any affordable housing projects that required a General Plan Amendment or even a zone change to begin construction. So far, I have only been told about one case in all of Los Angeles.\" He said the city's own reports confirmed this, and that the 2% of new housing that was meant for lower-income renters and buyers came about not because of any municipal action but through state laws allowing higher densities for affordable housing. Platkin further noted that the city owned 9,000 parcels on which such housing could be built, only a few of which had been so developed. \"Now, suddenly, this long-ignored affordable housing option has been taken out of mothballs\", he said, suggesting it was in direct response to the threat posed to developers' alleged control over City Hall by Measure S.<ref name=\"Dick Platkin column\">{{cite news|last=Platkin|first=Richard|title=Big Real Estate's Big Bamboozle to Beat Back Measure S on March 7|url=http://www.citywatchla.com/index.php/los-angeles/12462-big-real-estate-s-big-bamboozle-to-beat-back-measure-s-on-march-7|newspaper=City Watch LA|date=January 19, 2017|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Role of transit-oriented development===\n\nOpponents criticized the provision forbidding the city from granting reductions of more than one-third the required parking spaces, since they said it went against the city's goals of encouraging [[transit-oriented development]] along [[Los Angeles Metro|subway lines]] and other major transportation corridors. The CPLA said these large parking variances did not accomplish that goal, \"instead send[ing] drivers seeking parking spilling into overwhelmed neighborhoods.\" It claimed some residents of these developments were walking five [[city block|blocks]] to and from their homes to parking spaces on a daily basis.<ref name=\"CPLA FAQs page\" />\n \nHowever, the CPLA had also contributed $10,000 to a campaign against November's [[Measure R#Measure M|Measure M]], a county-level initiative which increased the [[Sales and use taxes in California|sales tax]] a half-percent to pay for [[light rail]] extensions. Stewart explained that they saw transit as a \"development arm\". ''[[The Real Deal (magazine)|The Real Deal]]'', another real-estate website, suggested that indicated the coalition was as opposed to transit{{efn|SOHA head Richard Close, another staunch supporter of Measure S, also campaigned against Measure M, but his opposition was based on concerns that Valley residents would not get transit spending commensurate with what they contributed in increased taxes.<ref name=\"LA Magazine SOHA article\" />}} as it was to [[traffic congestion]], which it frequently cited as an argument for Measure S, an argument that seemed contradictory.<ref name=\"Curbed Measure M piece\">{{cite news|last=Chen|first=Cathaleen|title=NII backers are bankrolling anti-Measure M campaign|url=https://therealdeal.com/la/2016/10/20/nii-backers-are-bankrolling-the-anti-measure-m-campaign/|newspaper=The Real Deal|date=October 20, 2016|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In an earlier interview with ''The Planning Report'', Stewart had expressed skepticism about the role of transit in reshaping Angelenos' lives. \"People who can afford to own cars continue to drive their cars\", she said. \"No amount of discussion will get people to give up that freedom.\" If the city truly wanted to reduce congestion, she suggested, it should offer tax breaks to people who [[Telecommuting|work from their homes]].<ref name=\"TPR Feb 2016 Stewart interview\">{{cite interview|last=Stewart|first=Jill|subject-link=Jill Stewart|title=Stewart: Neighborhood Integrity Initiative Is LA's Response to Unplanned Density and Insider Deals|url=http://www.planningreport.com/2016/02/16/stewart-neighborhood-integrity-initiative-las-response-unplanned-density-and-insider|date=February 16, 2016|work=The Planning Report|access-date=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n''Times'' architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne also noted that when [[Hollywood]] had updated its Community Plan in 2012 to allow for more transit-friendly development, three community groups, including Fix the City, a descendant of [[Not Yet New York]], which had been a key force behind the similar [[Proposition U]] in 1986, successfully sued to block it. He said this pointed to \"the basic hypocrisy that the authors of Measure S and other slow-growth advocates can't argue away ... Many say they're in favor of updating the community plans but fought to block one that didn't match their vision of low-rise, essentially suburban Los Angeles.\"<ref name=\"Christopher Hawthorne LAT piece\" />\n\n\"Some clever-by-half advocates of sustainability imagine that every large and tall apartment building is automatically transit-oriented,\" Platkin responded to those arguments. Those that had been built near Los Angeles's subway stations, he said, were so far only transit-adjacent, since their residents still used their cars to get around<ref name=\"Dick Platkin column\" /> (AHF head Weinstein similarly argued that \"People who pay $3,800 [a month] for an apartment are not the ones who ride the subway.\")<ref name=\"Advocate story\" /> Only when such development was built for lower-income tenants and residents who depended on transit to get to work, Platkin wrote, could it truly be described as transit-oriented. He allowed that Los Angeles's relationship with mass transit could indeed be reconfigured to be more like that of New York or San Francisco, but it would require improvements to the streets making them more amenable to bicyclists and pedestrians, not just high-density development near transit stops.<ref name=\"Dick Platkin column\" />\n\n===Vision of Los Angeles's future: ''Blade Runner'' vs. ''Her''===\n{{cquote|<center>There are as many possible cities as there are possible forms of human society,<br />but Los Angeles emphatically suggests there is no simple correlation between urban form and social form.</center>|author=[[Reyner Banham]] in ''Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies''<ref name=\"Reyner Banham quote\">{{cite book|last=Banham|first=Reyner|authorlink=Reyner Banham|title=Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies|date=2009|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=9780520260153|page=219|edition=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynIqpeK01egC&pg=PA219|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nUnderlying the Measure S debate were contrasting visions of the city and what direction it would take in the future. \"Longtime residents of Los Angeles have in their collective imagination an image of what the city should look like and how they should live in it,\" [[D. J. Waldie]], a [[Lakewood, California|Lakewood]] native and author of ''Holy Land'', a well-regarded memoir of his youth in the planned suburb, told the ''Times''' Thomas Curwen. \"[I]t's that image that is being interfered with as the city becomes more dense.

She characterized [[urban planning|urban planners]] who advocated that as \"stuck in a different world\" and their ideal of urban living as \"everyone needs to move close together and cram their children into places where there is nowhere to play. The theory that people enjoy living around the noise and congestion is wrong, and we need to respond to how people really live.\"<ref name=\"Aug 2016 TPR Stewart interview\">{{cite interview |last=Stewart|first=Jill|subject-link=Jill Stewart|title=Neighborhood Integrity Initiatives's Letter to Mayor Garcetti: Either Lead on Planning or Voters Will|url=http://www.planningreport.com/2016/08/22/neighborhood-integrity-initiatives-s-letter-mayor-garcetti-lead-planning-or-voters-will|date=August 22, 2016|work=The Planning Report|access-date=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nPlatkin told Curwen that the real struggle, in his opinion, was not over the density of development but the role of the public in shaping it. Nonetheless, he used a cinematic reference point invoked by other proponents of Measure S. \"If you have a city whose land-use policies are determined by the roller coaster of real estate speculation, you will have a city that looks like ''[[Blade Runner]]''\", referring to the seminal 1982 science fiction film set in a 2019 Los Angeles of endless skyscrapers.<ref name=\"LAT future article\" /> Another vocal Measure S proponent, Kenneth Alpern, mocked opponents as \"[those] who believe that megadevelopment and a ''Blade Runner'' scenario of a sterile, overcrowded Los Angeles is WONDERFUL.\"<ref name=\"Kenneth Alpern piece\">{{cite news|last=Alpern|first=Kenneth|title=LA's City Council Rushing to Implement 'Measure S' ...

But its residents seem content with living that way, a lifestyle that depends far more on public transportation than it does today. \"The future imagined by one generation is not necessarily the future wanted by another,\" he wrote. \"the debate over density is challenging popular presumptions of the single-family home. Like the car, it has become a symbol of urban unsustainability.\"<ref name=\"LAT future article\" />\n\nCurwen talked to two experts who had contrasting views. [[Joel Kotkin]], a [[Valley Village, Los Angeles|Valley Village]] resident and professor at [[Chapman University]] known for his beliefs that recent proclamations of urban comeback are illusory since Americans prefer a suburban lifestyle, told him that while he did not envision [[Downtown Los Angeles|downtown]] becoming much bigger a part of the city than it was in [[Indianapolis]] or [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], current development trends threatened to overwhelm the suburban aspects of Los Angeles that had made it so attractive for most of the 20th century. But [[Zev Yaroslavsky]], who as a councilman in the mid-1980s had led the fight for [[Proposition U]], which preserved the city's low-density character, did not see Los Angeles as having to choose. \"The suburbs aren't going anywhere,\" he told Curwen. \"I look at the changes ahead of us as additive. You now have a more urban dimension to the city of L.A.\"<ref name=\"LAT future article\" />\n\n===Role of AHF in sponsoring initiative===\n\nOpponents questioned what an initiative focusing on municipal zoning had to do with the [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation|AHF]]'s primary mission of offering treatment for [[AIDS]] patients through the pharmacies and clinics it operated. Its previous sponsorship of the successful 2012 [[Measure B]], requiring all actors in [[pornographic film]]s produced in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], to wear [[condom]]s during sex scenes, and [[California Proposition 60 (2016)|Proposition 60]], the unsuccessful effort to extend that prohibition to the state level after adult-film production companies left the county to avoid complying with Measure B, alienated some members of [[LGBT culture in Los Angeles|the city's LGBT community]] and was seen as overreach, but one still compatible with its mission.<ref name=\"Advocate story\" /> \"Why the AIDS Healthcare Foundation is spending its time and money fighting battles over land-use and transportation policy is of course [an] ... excellent question\", wrote ''Times'' architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne.<ref name=\"Christopher Hawthorne LAT piece\" /> The paper also devoted an editorial to it. \"How is this social justice?

''Curbed'' attempted to learn whether he had actually signed the petition to get the initiative on the ballot, but was told by the city clerk's office that those signatures are not public record. The website said this raised the possibility that some of those signatures could have been obtained under a pretense (as tech executive Stephen Corwin claimed he had witnessed<ref name=\"Corwin Medium open letter followup\" />), or that DiCaprio had signed on to support the measure without fully understanding what it entailed.<ref name=\"Curbed story\">{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Alissa|title=Updated: Leonardo DiCaprio never endorsed LA's anti-development measure, rep says|url=http://la.curbed.com/2016/10/20/13350554/leonardo-dicaprio-anti-development-measure-support|newspaper=[[Curbed]]|date=October 20, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn February, the CPLA sent out a mailer to voters that had on one side a picture of a smiling [[Eric Garcetti|Garcetti]], his signature and the quote \"I Agree\".

The [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], whose name was on the mailer, wrote to CPLA demanding they [[cease and desist]] from using their name, or at least follow up and tell recipients the mailer was not an actual eviction notice.<ref name=\"LAT eviction notice mailer story\" />\n\n\"We appreciate the county of Los Angeles giving the Yes on S campaign some last-minute critical media attention, on our key issue: that developers of luxury towers evict poor and working-class Angelenos every day,\" Stewart responded.

Stewart further speculated that the sheriff might have been acting at the behest of opponents of Measure S, since they had used the same political consulting firm.<ref name=\"LAT eviction notice mailer story\" /> Later the CPLA refused to retract the mailer, calling it [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|protected political speech]], and expressing doubt that anyone could seriously have assumed it was an actual eviction notice.<ref name=\"LAT eviction notice follow-up story\">{{cite news|last=Reyes|first=Emily Alpert|title=Measure S campaign bucks Sheriff's Dept. demands on 'eviction' mailers|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-eviction-mailer-reaction-20170227-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 27, 2017|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Vote==\n\nSince the mayoral race, as well as most of the council contests, was not seriously contested, Measure S was the most closely followed vote on the night of March 7, due to the amount spent by both sides on advertising and messaging.<ref name=\"LA Weekly result article\">{{cite news|last=Aron|first=Hillel|title=L.A.

After the war, with federal housing subsidies driving construction, zoning was often changed when actual uses differed; most of the farms of the [[San Fernando Valley]] disappeared by the 1960s to make way for residential development.

Since California's [[Ellis Act]], under which landlords can evict tenants if they are no longer offering the units for rent, was state law beyond the scope of city ballot initiatives, Measure S could not address them directly. Supporters claimed instead that its provisions would drive down the number of evictions by making it harder to build the kind of housing for which tenants were evicted.<ref name=\"LAT evictions story\">{{cite news|last1=Khouri|first1=Andrew|last2=Poston|first2=Ben|title=The luxury housing that Measure S would stop doesn't actually require many evictions|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-measure-s-rent-control-20170124-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 24, 2017|accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the ''Times'' found that many of the developments for which rent-controlled tenants had been evicted had not needed the spot zoning the measure intended to stop in order to be built; one such project had been one from which an [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]] woman featured in one of the pro-S campaign advertisements was evicted. Fewer than 10% of all the evictions of rent-controlled tenants between 2011\u20132015 had been for projects that would have been affected by the proposed moratorium, the paper found. Miki Jackson, a spokeswoman for the supporters said that they were concerned about the \"enormous ripple effect\" spot zoned projects have, since they lead to [[gentrification]] and more Ellis Act evictions. She acknowledged, however, that the 22,000 evictions were the ''total'' Ellis Act evictions since 2000, not just those triggered by spot zoning.<ref name=\"LAT evictions story\" />\n\nOpponents argued that preventing spot zoning temporarily would actually increase Ellis Act evictions during that time. Most spot zoned projects were proposed for sites on which no housing had previously existed, they noted. If [[land development|developers]] could not build on those, they would turn instead to remodeling and rebuilding housing in older neighborhoods, with more rent controlled tenants subject to Ellis Act eviction. \"[It] will leave in place the options that removed the most housing,\" said Josh Kamensky, a spokesman for the CPLANJ.<ref name=\"LAT evictions story\" />\n\n===Alleged corrupt influence on planning process===\n\nAs proof that the city government had been corrupted to the point of needing the drastic steps the initiative would take, supporters began touting<ref name=\"CPLA FAQs page\" /> a lengthy October 2016 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article. It described Sea Breeze, a [[Torrance, California|Torrance]]-area apartment project, that was approved for construction despite its proximity to several industrial sites that could adversely affect the quality of life for residents. The newspaper found that large campaign contributions to mayor [[Eric Garcetti]] and key city council members including [[Janice Hahn]], later elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]], came from individuals of modest means who worked for companies connected to the project's developer, although those contributors did not recall writing checks for amounts they admitted were equal to what they earned in weeks or even months (many of which also appeared to be written by the same person regardless of whose account they were drawn on). In some cases the purported contributors were not even [[voter registration|registered to vote]]. The city's planning commission had twice unanimously rejected Sea Breeze, only to be overruled by city council. To facilitate one of those votes, Garcetti had invoked a rarely used mayoral power to temporarily reduce the number of votes necessary for passage.<ref name=\"Sea Breeze\">{{cite news|last1=Zahnhiser|first1=David|last2=Reyes|first2=Emily Alpert|title=A $72-million apartment project.

While Measure S supporters approved of the effort, many thought it made their points about how necessary the initiative was. \"It's an admission of guilt\", said Sherman Oaks Homeowners Association (SOHA) president Richard Close, a supporter.<ref name=\"LAT contribution ban article\">{{cite news|last1=Zahnhiser|first1=David|last2=Reyes|first2=Emily Alpert|title=L.A. politicians propose banning campaign contributions from developers|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-contributions-ban-20170110-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 10, 2017|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Possible effects of moratorium===\n\nThe practical effect of the moratorium was another point of disagreement between the two sides. Supporters repeatedly stated that only 5% of development in the city would be halted by it, and that it would only last two years.<ref name=\"CPLA FAQs page\" /> Opponents responded that both claims were misleading. The 5% figure was based, they said, on an apparent analysis of all [[Planning permission|permits]]; however, they implied, most of the construction that would be allowed was improvements to existing buildings or very small-scale housing, and the 5% of blocked projects included most of the larger multi-unit proposals seeking approval.<ref name=\"CPLANJ Fact Check page\" /><ref name=\"Abundant Housing LA page\" /> And due to the initiative's requirement that the city update its entire zoning, a process which could take longer than two years, opponents estimated it could be as long as ten years before developers felt comfortable building again.<ref name=\"CPLANJ Fact Check page\" />\n\nOpponents also disputed supporters' claims that Measure S would not affect any plans for [[affordable housing]]. Instead, they claimed, 90% of those projects would not be able to built since they would require the sort of variances the initiative would forbid for projects on those scales.<ref name=\"CPLANJ Fact Check page\" /> One cartographer identified city-owned [[parking lot]]s on which 724 units could be built, but only if the General Plan, which currently allowed only industrial use on the property, were amended, something the measure would forbid even for projects of entirely affordable housing.<ref name=\"Urbanize LA post\">{{cite news|last=Sharp|first=Stephen|title=Proposed Ballot Measure Would Prevent Homeless Housing on City-Owned Sites|url=http://urbanize.la/post/proposed-ballot-measure-would-prevent-homeless-housing-city-owned-sites|newspaper=Urbanize.LA|date=January 17, 2017|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}</ref> They also dismissed the exemption for such projects, saying that was \"yet another example of 60 year old solutions to today's problems\", in the CPLANJ's words.<ref name=\"CPLANJ Fact Check page\" />\n\nRichard Platkin, a former city planner who strongly supported Measure S, wrote that these arguments were specious. \"For nearly an entire year\", he wrote in a January 2017 ''City Watch LA'' column, \"I have repeatedly asked ... readers to identify any affordable housing projects that required a General Plan Amendment or even a zone change to begin construction. So far, I have only been told about one case in all of Los Angeles.\" He said the city's own reports confirmed this, and that the 2% of new housing that was meant for lower-income renters and buyers came about not because of any municipal action but through state laws allowing higher densities for affordable housing. Platkin further noted that the city owned 9,000 parcels on which such housing could be built, only a few of which had been so developed. \"Now, suddenly, this long-ignored affordable housing option has been taken out of mothballs\", he said, suggesting it was in direct response to the threat posed to developers' alleged control over City Hall by Measure S.<ref name=\"Dick Platkin column\">{{cite news|last=Platkin|first=Richard|title=Big Real Estate's Big Bamboozle to Beat Back Measure S on March 7|url=http://www.citywatchla.com/index.php/los-angeles/12462-big-real-estate-s-big-bamboozle-to-beat-back-measure-s-on-march-7|newspaper=City Watch LA|date=January 19, 2017|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Role of transit-oriented development===\n\nOpponents criticized the provision forbidding the city from granting reductions of more than one-third the required parking spaces, since they said it went against the city's goals of encouraging [[transit-oriented development]] along [[Los Angeles Metro|subway lines]] and other major transportation corridors. The CPLA said these large parking variances did not accomplish that goal, \"instead send[ing] drivers seeking parking spilling into overwhelmed neighborhoods.\" It claimed some residents of these developments were walking five [[city block|blocks]] to and from their homes to parking spaces on a daily basis.<ref name=\"CPLA FAQs page\" />\n \nHowever, the CPLA had also contributed $10,000 to a campaign against November's [[Measure R#Measure M|Measure M]], a county-level initiative which increased the [[Sales and use taxes in California|sales tax]] a half-percent to pay for [[light rail]] extensions. Stewart explained that they saw transit as a \"development arm\". ''[[The Real Deal (magazine)|The Real Deal]]'', another real-estate website, suggested that indicated the coalition was as opposed to transit{{efn|SOHA head Richard Close, another staunch supporter of Measure S, also campaigned against Measure M, but his opposition was based on concerns that Valley residents would not get transit spending commensurate with what they contributed in increased taxes.<ref name=\"LA Magazine SOHA article\" />}} as it was to [[traffic congestion]], which it frequently cited as an argument for Measure S, an argument that seemed contradictory.<ref name=\"Curbed Measure M piece\">{{cite news|last=Chen|first=Cathaleen|title=NII backers are bankrolling anti-Measure M campaign|url=https://therealdeal.com/la/2016/10/20/nii-backers-are-bankrolling-the-anti-measure-m-campaign/|newspaper=The Real Deal|date=October 20, 2016|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In an earlier interview with ''The Planning Report'', Stewart had expressed skepticism about the role of transit in reshaping Angelenos' lives. \"People who can afford to own cars continue to drive their cars\", she said. \"No amount of discussion will get people to give up that freedom.\" If the city truly wanted to reduce congestion, she suggested, it should offer tax breaks to people who [[Telecommuting|work from their homes]].<ref name=\"TPR Feb 2016 Stewart interview\">{{cite interview|last=Stewart|first=Jill|subject-link=Jill Stewart|title=Stewart: Neighborhood Integrity Initiative Is LA's Response to Unplanned Density and Insider Deals|url=http://www.planningreport.com/2016/02/16/stewart-neighborhood-integrity-initiative-las-response-unplanned-density-and-insider|date=February 16, 2016|work=The Planning Report|access-date=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n''Times'' architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne also noted that when [[Hollywood]] had updated its Community Plan in 2012 to allow for more transit-friendly development, three community groups, including Fix the City, a descendant of [[Not Yet New York]], which had been a key force behind the similar [[Proposition U]] in 1986, successfully sued to block it. He said this pointed to \"the basic hypocrisy that the authors of Measure S and other slow-growth advocates can't argue away ... Many say they're in favor of updating the community plans but fought to block one that didn't match their vision of low-rise, essentially suburban Los Angeles.\"<ref name=\"Christopher Hawthorne LAT piece\" />\n\n\"Some clever-by-half advocates of sustainability imagine that every large and tall apartment building is automatically transit-oriented,\" Platkin responded to those arguments. Those that had been built near Los Angeles's subway stations, he said, were so far only transit-adjacent, since their residents still used their cars to get around<ref name=\"Dick Platkin column\" /> (AHF head Weinstein similarly argued that \"People who pay $3,800 [a month] for an apartment are not the ones who ride the subway.\")<ref name=\"Advocate story\" /> Only when such development was built for lower-income tenants and residents who depended on transit to get to work, Platkin wrote, could it truly be described as transit-oriented. He allowed that Los Angeles's relationship with mass transit could indeed be reconfigured to be more like that of New York or San Francisco, but it would require improvements to the streets making them more amenable to bicyclists and pedestrians, not just high-density development near transit stops.<ref name=\"Dick Platkin column\" />\n\n===Vision of Los Angeles's future: ''Blade Runner'' vs. ''Her''===\n{{cquote|<center>There are as many possible cities as there are possible forms of human society,<br />but Los Angeles emphatically suggests there is no simple correlation between urban form and social form.</center>|author=[[Reyner Banham]] in ''Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies''<ref name=\"Reyner Banham quote\">{{cite book|last=Banham|first=Reyner|authorlink=Reyner Banham|title=Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies|date=2009|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=9780520260153|page=219|edition=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynIqpeK01egC&pg=PA219|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nUnderlying the Measure S debate were contrasting visions of the city and what direction it would take in the future. \"Longtime residents of Los Angeles have in their collective imagination an image of what the city should look like and how they should live in it,\" [[D. J. Waldie]], a [[Lakewood, California|Lakewood]] native and author of ''Holy Land'', a well-regarded memoir of his youth in the planned suburb, told the ''Times''' Thomas Curwen. \"[I]t's that image that is being interfered with as the city becomes more dense.

She characterized [[urban planning|urban planners]] who advocated that as \"stuck in a different world\" and their ideal of urban living as \"everyone needs to move close together and cram their children into places where there is nowhere to play. The theory that people enjoy living around the noise and congestion is wrong, and we need to respond to how people really live.\"<ref name=\"Aug 2016 TPR Stewart interview\">{{cite interview |last=Stewart|first=Jill|subject-link=Jill Stewart|title=Neighborhood Integrity Initiatives's Letter to Mayor Garcetti: Either Lead on Planning or Voters Will|url=http://www.planningreport.com/2016/08/22/neighborhood-integrity-initiatives-s-letter-mayor-garcetti-lead-planning-or-voters-will|date=August 22, 2016|work=The Planning Report|access-date=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nPlatkin told Curwen that the real struggle, in his opinion, was not over the density of development but the role of the public in shaping it. Nonetheless, he used a cinematic reference point invoked by other proponents of Measure S. \"If you have a city whose land-use policies are determined by the roller coaster of real estate speculation, you will have a city that looks like ''[[Blade Runner]]''\", referring to the seminal 1982 science fiction film set in a 2019 Los Angeles of endless skyscrapers.<ref name=\"LAT future article\" /> Another vocal Measure S proponent, Kenneth Alpern, mocked opponents as \"[those] who believe that megadevelopment and a ''Blade Runner'' scenario of a sterile, overcrowded Los Angeles is WONDERFUL.\"<ref name=\"Kenneth Alpern piece\">{{cite news|last=Alpern|first=Kenneth|title=LA's City Council Rushing to Implement 'Measure S' ...

But its residents seem content with living that way, a lifestyle that depends far more on public transportation than it does today. \"The future imagined by one generation is not necessarily the future wanted by another,\" he wrote. \"the debate over density is challenging popular presumptions of the single-family home. Like the car, it has become a symbol of urban unsustainability.\"<ref name=\"LAT future article\" />\n\nCurwen talked to two experts who had contrasting views. [[Joel Kotkin]], a [[Valley Village, Los Angeles|Valley Village]] resident and professor at [[Chapman University]] known for his beliefs that recent proclamations of urban comeback are illusory since Americans prefer a suburban lifestyle, told him that while he did not envision [[Downtown Los Angeles|downtown]] becoming much bigger a part of the city than it was in [[Indianapolis]] or [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], current development trends threatened to overwhelm the suburban aspects of Los Angeles that had made it so attractive for most of the 20th century. But [[Zev Yaroslavsky]], who as a councilman in the mid-1980s had led the fight for [[Proposition U]], which preserved the city's low-density character, did not see Los Angeles as having to choose. \"The suburbs aren't going anywhere,\" he told Curwen. \"I look at the changes ahead of us as additive. You now have a more urban dimension to the city of L.A.\"<ref name=\"LAT future article\" />\n\n===Role of AHF in sponsoring initiative===\n\nOpponents questioned what an initiative focusing on municipal zoning had to do with the [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation|AHF]]'s primary mission of offering treatment for [[AIDS]] patients through the pharmacies and clinics it operated. Its previous sponsorship of the successful 2012 [[Measure B]], requiring all actors in [[pornographic film]]s produced in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], to wear [[condom]]s during sex scenes, and [[California Proposition 60 (2016)|Proposition 60]], the unsuccessful effort to extend that prohibition to the state level after adult-film production companies left the county to avoid complying with Measure B, alienated some members of [[LGBT culture in Los Angeles|the city's LGBT community]] and was seen as overreach, but one still compatible with its mission.<ref name=\"Advocate story\" /> \"Why the AIDS Healthcare Foundation is spending its time and money fighting battles over land-use and transportation policy is of course [an] ... excellent question\", wrote ''Times'' architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne.<ref name=\"Christopher Hawthorne LAT piece\" /> The paper also devoted an editorial to it. \"How is this social justice?

It suggested the foundation's real motivation was to block the Palladium Towers development that its head, Michael Weinstein, had complained ruined the view of the [[Hollywood Hills]] from his office.<ref name=\"LAT AHF editorial\" /><ref name=\"LAT AHF story\" />\n\nThe ''Times'' noted that as of a week before the election the AHF had spent $4.6 million on the initiative, accounting for almost all the CPLA's financial support. Dana Cuff, an urban design professor at UCLA's Luskin School, told LGBT magazine ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' that at best, AHF's use of the money for the initiative was \"not understandable\". Later she said it was \"actually a misuse of their funds\".<ref name=\"Advocate story\" /> A former AHF volunteer turned critic told the ''Times'' it a \"blatant abuse of the[ir] resources\".<ref name=\"LAT AHF story\" />\n\nDuring the campaign, the [[Los Angeles LGBT Center]] held a news conference not only opposing Measure S but criticizing AHF for having sponsored it.

''Curbed'' attempted to learn whether he had actually signed the petition to get the initiative on the ballot, but was told by the city clerk's office that those signatures are not public record. The website said this raised the possibility that some of those signatures could have been obtained under a pretense (as tech executive Stephen Corwin claimed he had witnessed<ref name=\"Corwin Medium open letter followup\" />), or that DiCaprio had signed on to support the measure without fully understanding what it entailed.<ref name=\"Curbed story\">{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Alissa|title=Updated: Leonardo DiCaprio never endorsed LA's anti-development measure, rep says|url=http://la.curbed.com/2016/10/20/13350554/leonardo-dicaprio-anti-development-measure-support|newspaper=[[Curbed]]|date=October 20, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn February, the CPLA sent out a mailer to voters that had on one side a picture of a smiling [[Eric Garcetti|Garcetti]], his signature and the quote \"I Agree\".

However, the editorial noted, as with the Garcetti mailer those mailers had not stated that the newspaper had consistently opposed the measure.<ref name=\"LAT mailers editorial\" />\n\nThe claims of support by opponents was not the only aspect of the CPLA mailers that led to accusations of deception.

This one appeared to be an eviction notice, using the same format as real ones, although there was small print identifying it as a paid political advertisement and the line with the purported case number was filled in with \"This could be you or a loved one!\" Tenants' organizations received calls from worried members who thought they were real, leading the head of one such group to call the CPLA \"outrageous and irresponsible\". The [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], whose name was on the mailer, wrote to CPLA demanding they [[cease and desist]] from using their name, or at least follow up and tell recipients the mailer was not an actual eviction notice.<ref name=\"LAT eviction notice mailer story\" />\n\n\"We appreciate the county of Los Angeles giving the Yes on S campaign some last-minute critical media attention, on our key issue: that developers of luxury towers evict poor and working-class Angelenos every day,\" Stewart responded. A leader of one tenant group, the Eviction Defense Network, agreed, calling the tactic \"forceful\". Stewart further speculated that the sheriff might have been acting at the behest of opponents of Measure S, since they had used the same political consulting firm.<ref name=\"LAT eviction notice mailer story\" /> Later the CPLA refused to retract the mailer, calling it [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|protected political speech]], and expressing doubt that anyone could seriously have assumed it was an actual eviction notice.<ref name=\"LAT eviction notice follow-up story\">{{cite news|last=Reyes|first=Emily Alpert|title=Measure S campaign bucks Sheriff's Dept. demands on 'eviction' mailers|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-eviction-mailer-reaction-20170227-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 27, 2017|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Vote==\n\nSince the mayoral race, as well as most of the council contests, was not seriously contested, Measure S was the most closely followed vote on the night of March 7, due to the amount spent by both sides on advertising and messaging.<ref name=\"LA Weekly result article\">{{cite news|last=Aron|first=Hillel|title=L.A.

A post-election analysis by the ''Times'', with an accompanying showed only isolated areas of support, with no neighborhood supporting the initiative outright. Many of these precincts were small, some with fewer than 10 votes cast, leading the newspaper not to publish totals or margins for privacy reasons. These areas were small portions of [[Downtown Los Angeles|downtown]], [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]], [[Fairfax, Los Angeles|Fairfax]], [[Koreatown, Los Angeles|Koreatown]], [[Valley Glen, Los Angeles|Valley Glen]] and the large southern area of [[Westchester, Los Angeles|Westchester]] mostly given over to [[Los Angeles International Airport]].<ref name=\"LAT interactive voting map\">{{cite map |last1=Fox|first1=Joe|last2=Pesce|first2=Anthony|title=This map shows how Measure S lost all across Los Angeles|date=March 10, 2017|url=http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-measure-s-results/|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFor precincts where there had been enough to display results, in those scattered areas where Measure S won its margin of victory was narrow, around 51\u201352%, often a difference of less than ten actual votes.

Many of these areas were on the [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|Westside]], where the billboards promoting the initiative had been most concentrated. Some precincts there recorded margins far above the city average against S, in the 70\u201380% range; in one between National Boulevard and the [[Santa Monica Freeway]] at the south boundary of [[Castle Heights, Los Angeles|Castle Heights]], the margin of defeat was 87%. Opposition was strongest in [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]]: 89% of the precinct that includes the [[UCLA]] campus voted no, and 92% of an off-campus area to the northwest voted against Measure S.<ref name=\"LAT interactive voting map\" />\n\n===Reaction===\n\nOpponents expressed relief. \"Defeating Measure S has spared our city from a future that would've meant fewer jobs, fewer funds for critical public services, fewer new homes for those who desperately need them, and even less affordable rents,\" according to Rusty Hicks of the county Federation of Labor. \"[P]eople understood the devastating impact [it] would have on our community if it passed,\" said Los Angeles Area [[Chamber of Commerce]] president Gary Toebben.<ref name=\"LAT election result\" />\n\nWeinstein, whose [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation|AHF]] had sponsored the measure, remained upbeat. \"This campaign will go down in the record books as one of the most successful campaigns that did not actually win the vote,\" he said.
