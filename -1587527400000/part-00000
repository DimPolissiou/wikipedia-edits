Today, the library also houses the largest collection of ancient [[papyri]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]], 300 [[medieval]] manuscripts, and thousands of rare and first-edition early European and American works. Some of the most famous library holdings are the ''Mark Twain Papers'', a collection of letters, journals, and nearly 600 manuscripts of unpublished works by [[Samuel L.

While each campus library is separate, they share (through the UC library system) facilities for storage, computerized indexing, digital libraries and management.  For example, each campus maintains its own computerized [[library catalog]] and simultaneously participates in the systemwide [[union catalog]], MELVYL.\n\nThe UC libraries also manage a digital library, the [[California Digital Library]] or CDL. They also hold special collections and electronic archives of research documents.  Special collections include historical archives on California history, federal depositories, law libraries, specialized collections for medical and scientific research, and a series of periodicals.\n\nA major concern of the library system is the rising cost of scientific journal subscriptions, and the costs of renting article databases.  The library is leading an effort to publish science research online in a persistently-available electronic format, primarily through a digital repository called the eScholarship repository.\n\nThe physical collections are scattered across the UC campuses. Their collections and stand-alone library buildings are listed below.\n\nIn the 1980s, to relieve overcrowding in existing on-campus library buildings, the UC system constructed two regional library facilities: the Northern Regional Library Facility at UC Berkeley's Richmond Field Station (opened 1982), and the Southern Regional Library Facility on the western edge of the UCLA campus (opened 1987).  As of 2007, Northern Regional Library Facility is home to 4.7 million volumes, while SRLF is home to 5.7 million.  Each facility receives items from all UC campuses in its respective region of the state, and has climate controls and high-density stacks. Items are shelved two deep and are arranged in a sequence that results in efficient use of space (but is not quite as intuitive as traditional library indexing systems).  As a result, casual browsing is prohibited, and the shelves are accessible only by library clerks trained to retrieve and put back items properly.  Users must page materials to an on-site reading room or to a library at their home campus.\n\n==List of collections by campus==\n[[Image:UCB-University-Library.jpg|thumb|[[Doe Memorial Library]], Berkeley]]\n\n===Berkeley (18 university libraries and 11 affiliated libraries\u2014including Law)===\n*[[University of California, Berkeley Library System]]\n*[[Doe Memorial Library]] (Main Collections and Main Stacks)\n*[[Moffitt Library]] (Undergraduate)\n*[[Bancroft Library]] (Special Collections)\n*Hargrove Music Library\n\n===Davis (11 major libraries\u2014including Law and Medical)===\n*[[Peter J.

In addition, all campuses allow any California resident to apply for a library card and thus gain limited borrowing privileges for libraries on that campus, although there is typically a charge for these cards.\n\nMaterials may be borrowed between the UC campus libraries or from the regional library facilities through [[interlibrary loan]]; it is generally possible for a student or other university associate to order a nonfragile, unreserved item and have it within a few days. Books may take between a day to a week to be delivered between campuses.\n\n==Librarians Association of the University of California==\n\nThe Librarians Association of the University of California (LAUC) is the statewide organization of librarians employed at least half-time in the UC Library system. Each campus also supports its own division. Librarians are academic appointees but not faculty. LAUC's objectives are to: advise the University on professional and governance matters, to make recommendations concerning UC librarians\u2019 rights, privileges, and obligations, and to promote full utilization of UC librarians\u2019 professional abilities. LAUC also awards research grants to its members to support librarian research and professional development.\n\n==See also==\n* [[California Digital Library]] \u2014 the digital library branch of the UC Libraries\n* [[Melvyl]] \u2014 the catalog of the UC Libraries\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/ The University of California Libraries]\n*[http://melvyl.cdlib.org/ The Melvyl Catalog]\n*[http://www.cdlib.org the California Digital Library]\n*[http://repositories.cdlib.org/escholarship/ the eScholarship repository]\n*[https://lauc.ucop.edu/ Librarians Association of the University of California]\n\n{{University of California}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:University and college academic libraries in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=July 2017}}\nThe [[University of California]] operates the largest [[academic library]] system in the world.

Special collections include historical archives on California history, federal depositories, law libraries, specialized collections for medical and scientific research, and a series of periodicals.\n\nA major concern of the library system is the rising cost of scientific journal subscriptions, and the costs of renting article databases.  The library is leading an effort to publish science research online in a persistently-available electronic format, primarily through a digital repository called the eScholarship repository.\n\nThe physical collections are scattered across the UC campuses. Their collections and stand-alone library buildings are listed below.\n\nIn the 1980s, to relieve overcrowding in existing on-campus library buildings, the UC system constructed two regional library facilities: the Northern Regional Library Facility at UC Berkeley's Richmond Field Station (opened 1982), and the Southern Regional Library Facility on the western edge of the UCLA campus (opened 1987).  As of 2007, Northern Regional Library Facility is home to 4.7 million volumes, while SRLF is home to 5.7 million.  Each facility receives items from all UC campuses in its respective region of the state, and has climate controls and high-density stacks. Items are shelved two deep and are arranged in a sequence that results in efficient use of space (but is not quite as intuitive as traditional library indexing systems).  As a result, casual browsing is prohibited, and the shelves are accessible only by library clerks trained to retrieve and put back items properly.  Users must page materials to an on-site reading room or to a library at their home campus.\n\n==List of collections by campus==\n[[Image:UCB-University-Library.jpg|thumb|[[Doe Memorial Library]], Berkeley]]\n\n===Berkeley (18 university libraries and 11 affiliated libraries\u2014including Law)===\n*[[University of California, Berkeley Library System]]\n*[[Doe Memorial Library]] (Main Collections and Main Stacks)\n*[[Moffitt Library]] (Undergraduate)\n*[[Bancroft Library]] (Special Collections)\n*Hargrove Music Library\n\n===Davis (11 major libraries\u2014including Law and Medical)===\n*[[Peter J.

In addition, all campuses allow any California resident to apply for a library card and thus gain limited borrowing privileges for libraries on that campus, although there is typically a charge for these cards.\n\nMaterials may be borrowed between the UC campus libraries or from the regional library facilities through [[interlibrary loan]]; it is generally possible for a student or other university associate to order a nonfragile, unreserved item and have it within a few days. Books may take between a day to a week to be delivered between campuses.\n\n==Librarians Association of the University of California==\n\nThe Librarians Association of the University of California (LAUC) is the statewide organization of librarians employed at least half-time in the UC Library system. Each campus also supports its own division. Librarians are academic appointees but not faculty. LAUC's objectives are to: advise the University on professional and governance matters, to make recommendations concerning UC librarians\u2019 rights, privileges, and obligations, and to promote full utilization of UC librarians\u2019 professional abilities. LAUC also awards research grants to its members to support librarian research and professional development.\n\n==See also==\n* [[California Digital Library]] \u2014 the digital library branch of the UC Libraries\n* [[Melvyl]] \u2014 the catalog of the UC Libraries\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/ The University of California Libraries]\n*[http://melvyl.cdlib.org/ The Melvyl Catalog]\n*[http://www.cdlib.org the California Digital Library]\n*[http://repositories.cdlib.org/escholarship/ the eScholarship repository]\n*[https://lauc.ucop.edu/ Librarians Association of the University of California]\n\n{{University of California}}\n\n[[Category:University and college academic libraries in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California_Libraries"}

The station is built along alongside [[Bayfront Avenue]]. Even though this station was named after the [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]], it is not the closest MRT station to the bay, with the [[Bayfront MRT station|Bayfront]] and [[Downtown MRT station|Downtown]] stations being closer than Marina Bay station.\n\nMarina Bay station was one of the last stations to be completed in the early phases of the MRT network, opening on 4 November 1989. It was the terminus of the North South line until the line's extension to [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier station]] in 2014. The station became an interchange station with the Circle line (CCL) upon the completion of the two-station branch extension to the station from [[Promenade MRT station|Promenade station]] in January 2012. The station will become a triple-line interchange when Stage 3 of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]] (TEL) opens in 2021.\n\n==History==\n===North South Line===\n[[File:Marina Bay MRT Station platform 20161204.jpg|thumb|left|North South line platforms.]]\nThe civil Contract 310 for the construction of the {{convert|900|m|miles}} cut-and-cover tunnels as well as Marina Bay MRT station was awarded to Gammon-Antara Koh joint venture at a value of [[Singapore dollar|S$]]96.16 million.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Soon Neo|first=Lim|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19860408-1.2.13.13?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=Marina%20Bay%20MRT&KA=Marina%20Bay%20MRT&DF=01%2F04%2F1985&DT=30%2F04%2F1990&NPT=&L=English&CTA=Article&QT=marina,bay,mrt&oref=article|title=Joint venture wins last big MRT deal|date=8 April 1986|work=The Business Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The construction of the tunnel to the station was rather challenging at the time, as the tunnel goes underwater through the Telok Ayer Basin and the station and tunnels were to be built in soft soil. Due to the soft marine clay, open excavation was not possible. Divers had to cut the {{convert|20|m|ft}} trenches, where the MRT tunnels were to be laid, in zero visibility in very muddy water. A concrete base for the tunnels was then set up with the water pumped out for the tunnels and the station to be built on. The tunnels would then be covered with another layer of concrete before the seabed is refilled.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dhaliwal|first=Rav|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19861027-1.2.25.13?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=Marina%20Bay%20MRT&KA=Marina%20Bay%20MRT&DF=01%2F04%2F1985&DT=30%2F04%2F1990&NPT=&L=English&CTA=Article&QT=marina,bay,mrt&oref=article|title=Divers to help build MRT tunnels|date=27 October 1986|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2020-04-21|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880312-1.2.81.8?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=Marina%20Bay%20MRT&KA=Marina%20Bay%20MRT&DF=01%2F04%2F1985&DT=30%2F04%2F1990&NPT=&L=English&CTA=Article&QT=marina,bay,mrt&oref=article-related|title=Underground and UNDERWATER|date=12 March 1988|work=The Straits Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/beritaharian19861017-1.2.17?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=Marina%20Bay%20MRT&KA=Marina%20Bay%20MRT&DF=01%2F04%2F1985&DT=30%2F04%2F1990&NPT=&L=&CTA=Article&QT=marina,bay,mrt&oref=article|title=Gali tanah dari bawah air untuk terowong|date=17 October 1986|work=Berita Harian|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> During the construction, a World War 2-era bomb was found at the work site.

Marina Bay station is also located in the public park, to be similar to Central Linear Park. The design aims to integrate the station into the park through the landscaping. The translucent canopy acts as a skylight to allow natural light penetrating into the underground hall. To further minimise the visual impact of the station to the surrounding park landscape, the lift, escalators, lightweight canopy and the reflective pool were visible from the street level, giving users full view of the park from the station entrance, similar to [[Bras Basah MRT station|Bras Basah]]. In addition, while the platforms at basement 1 are accessible only from the ticket concourse at basement 2, it is the first underground station to do the reverse, starting from the platforms at B1 and ending at the concourse at B2.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/getting_around/public_transport/rail_network/circle_line.html|title=LTA {{!}} Getting Around {{!}} Public Transport {{!}} Rail Network {{!}} Circle Line|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mot.gov.sg/news-centre/highlights/detail/circle-line-and-tuas-west-extension-updates|title=MOT Singapore \u2013 Gain new perspectives on land, sea & air transport|website=www.mot.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n===Art-in-Transit===\nThe station showcases two artworks as part of the Art-in-Transit programme for the station.

The station is built along alongside [[Bayfront Avenue]].

It was the terminus of the North South line until the line's extension to [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier station]] in 2014. The station became an interchange station with the Circle line (CCL) upon the completion of the two-station branch extension to the station from [[Promenade MRT station|Promenade station]] in January 2012.

[[Darren Rovell]] notes his history of Gatorade, ''First in Thirst'', \"the doctors realized that they probably shouldn't use the 'Aid' suffix, since that would mean that if the drink were ever marketed, they would have to prove that it had a clear medicinal use and perform clinical tests on thousands of people.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Rovell|first=Darren|title=First in Thirst: How Gatorade Turned the Science of Sweat Into a Cultural Phenomenon|date=September 2, 2005|publisher=AMACOM|isbn=0814410952|pages=24}}</ref> Gatorade co-inventor [[Dana Shires]] explained, \"We were told that you couldn't use that because the Food and Drug Administration prohibited that.

This tradition was popularized in the mid-1980s when [[Harry Carson]] and [[Jim Burt (American football)|Jim Burt]], of the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], doused head coach [[Bill Parcells]] during the 1985 season.

Yet, founding president [[Charles Duncan McIver]] spoke adamantly of the \"Library we are to have,\" and he personally donated many of his books to begin the school's first reference collection. Other faculty members followed suit, donating or lending books from their personal libraries in order to create a collection for student use. The school's book collection continued to grow, and, in 1896, [[Annie Florence Petty]] was hired as State Normal's first librarian.<ref>Myrtie Scarboro, \"Among Ourselves\" State Normal Magazine, IV (March 1900), 64.</ref> On October 2, 1905, the library at the State Normal and Industrial College (now The University of North Carolina at Greensboro) moved from a small room in the Main building (now the Foust building) to the newly constructed Carnegie Library (now the Forney Building). Recognizing the ever-growing need for more library space, College President Charles D. McIver contacted Andrew Carnegie, a well-known philanthropist and strong supporter of libraries, and asked for the funds needed to construct the building. Remarkably, he agreed to fund the entire project, which totaled $18,868 at its completion.\n\nUnfortunately, tragedy struck the library on September 15, 1932, when it mysteriously caught fire.  The final damage to the building and its contents, including the books, was estimated to be approximately $98,000 (or $1.6 million today). Afterwards, Mr. Charles H. Stone, the college Librarian, began the arduous task of rebuilding the damaged library collection. Books and materials that could be salvaged and saved were transported to the Students' Building while materials in the stacks were left in place, but were not accessible to students.\n\nThe Carnegie Library was rebuilt and remained the primary library on campus until June 1950 when the more than 134,000 books were moved to a new, larger library building across the street, later named in honor of former Chancellor Walter Clinton Jackson.    This older portion of the library still stands and houses much of the library administration and the special collections and university Archives. In 1964 the library became a federal document depository; it still retains the status as a selective depository for U.S. government documents, as well as a full depository for State documents. A nine-story tower addition was built to the main building in the 1970s, making it a landmark on campus.<ref>Trelease, Allen W. (2004) Making North Carolina Literate.

The Libraries house over one million printed volumes and provide access to more than 60,000 journals, more than 400,000 electronic books, and more than 360 electronic databases. The Digital Projects Team has created numerous digital collections, totaling more than 300,000 digital files, from the holdings of the University Libraries and other area institutions.\n\nThe Library Catalog of UNCG currently contains holdings for materials in the Walter Clinton Jackson Library, the Harold Schiffman Music Library, the Multicultural Resource Center, and the Teaching Resource Center. the holdings of Special Collections, Rare Books, and University Archives are increasingly available via the online catalog.\n\nThe Reference Collection is located in the ROI Department on the first floor of the Library's main wing. The collection consists of general and specialized encyclopedias, dictionaries, directories, and biographical sources. The Reference Collection also includes government reference sources, indexes and abstracts, telephone directories, and a map collection containing more than 12,000 items. Items do not circulate. The ROI Department's Subject Guides provide access to online and print resources on a variety of topics.\n\nThe Government Documents web pages provide extensive links to local, state, and national government information. The Government Documents collection is a part of the ROI Department.  Service is at the main Reference Desk on the 1st floor.  The collection includes both Federal and North Carolina documents.  The Library Catalog contains records of the Library's collection of Federal documents published after 1976 and NC State documents published after 1987.\n\nThe Harold Schiffman Music Library is located on the main level of the [[UNCG School of Music, Theatre and Dance|School of Music, Theatre and Dance]] building (corner of W Market and McIver Streets) and supports the educational, research, and service goals of the University by providing music resources, information, and services required by students, faculty, staff and community members. The collection consists of sound recordings, video recordings, scores, books and serials about music. Faculty, staff, and students are welcome to come to the Harold Schiffman Music Library to listen to and view sound and video materials and to check out books and scores.\n\nThe Martha Blakeney Hodges Special Collections and University Archives (SCUA) is located on the second floor of the Library's main wing.

Students, faculty and staff may reserve group spaces, many of which are equipped with technology, through a reservation system on the Libraries' home page.  Over 200 computers provide students with access to information resources as well as a wide variety of software.  \nIn addition to circulating books both the Jackson and Schiffman Libraries check out films, CDs and technology including laptops, iPads, video cameras, voice recorders and calculators.  The Check Out Desk in Jackson Library, maintained by the Access Services and Delivery Department (ASD), is staffed whenever the building is opened, including 24/5 service during the academic year.  ASD also offers reserves,  on-campus delivery of materials to faculty and Interlibrary Loan for all UNCG users.  \nThe Research, Outreach and Instruction (ROI) Department and the Schiffman Music Library provide research assistance to UNCG students, faculty and staff and members of the community in-house and also through on-line chat, email and telephone.  \nAn extensive information literacy program reaches students from the first-year through graduate work.  Librarians provide classroom instruction through the UNCG curriculum and develop a wide variety of online tutorials.    Distance students are reached through both synchronous and asynchronous instruction.\n\nA Libraries' liaison is assigned to each UNCG academic program.  Liaisons work closely with faculty to develop the print and electronic resources for their discipline.   They also help faculty develop effective information literacy assignments so that students gain these important skills.  Liaisons also provide in-depth research consultations for students and faculty.  \nThe Libraries maintain extensive LibGuides, online research guides, to provide easy access to resources in academic disciplines and other subject areas.  LibGuides are also developed for specific classes.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{University of North Carolina at Greensboro}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]\n[[Category:Libraries in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Skyscrapers in Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:University and college academic libraries in the United States]]\n[[Category:Skyscrapers in North Carolina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox library\n| name               = Walter Clinton Jackson Library\n| logo               = \n| image              = UNCG Jackson Library.JPG\n| caption            = Front entrance to Jackson Library\n| country            = {{USA}}\n| type               = \n| scope              = \n| established        = \n| ref_legal_mandate  = \n| location           = [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]],<br>[[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[North Carolina]]\n| coordinates        = \n| branch_of          = UNCG Libraries\n| num_branches       = \n| items_collected    = \n| collection_size    = \n| criteria           = \n| legal_deposit      = \n| req_to_access      = \n| annual_circulation = \n| pop_served         = \n| members            = \n| budget             = \n| director           = \n| num_employees      = \n| website            = {{URL|http://library.uncg.edu/}}\n| references         = \n}}\n\nThe [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] University Libraries system has two branches on campus, both located in Greensboro, NC. These include the '''Walter Clinton Jackson Library''' and the '''Harold Schiffman Music Library'''.  Affiliated campus libraries include the Teaching Resource Center and SELF Design Studio in the School of Education, the Interior Architecture Library in the Gatewood Studio Arts Building, and the Intercultural Resource Center located in the Elliot University Center. During the fall and spring semesters, Jackson Library provides a 24/5 study space for UNCG students, faculty and staff with UNCG ID from 12 am Monday \u2013 7:00 am Friday.<ref name=\"University Libraries homepage\">[http://library.uncg.edu University Libraries homepage]</ref> Dr. Martin Halbert is the current Dean of the libraries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsandfeatures.uncg.edu/halbert-dean-university-libraries/|title=Dr. Martin Halbert named dean of University Libraries|website=newsandfeatures.uncg.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nWhen State Normal and Industrial School (now UNCG) first opened its doors in October 1892, it did not have a library or library books. Yet, founding president [[Charles Duncan McIver]] spoke adamantly of the \"Library we are to have,\" and he personally donated many of his books to begin the school's first reference collection. Other faculty members followed suit, donating or lending books from their personal libraries in order to create a collection for student use. The school's book collection continued to grow, and, in 1896, [[Annie Florence Petty]] was hired as State Normal's first librarian.<ref>Myrtie Scarboro, \"Among Ourselves\" State Normal Magazine, IV (March 1900), 64.</ref> On October 2, 1905, the library at the State Normal and Industrial College (now The University of North Carolina at Greensboro) moved from a small room in the Main building (now the Foust building) to the newly constructed Carnegie Library (now the Forney Building). Recognizing the ever-growing need for more library space, College President Charles D. McIver contacted Andrew Carnegie, a well-known philanthropist and strong supporter of libraries, and asked for the funds needed to construct the building. Remarkably, he agreed to fund the entire project, which totaled $18,868 at its completion.\n\nUnfortunately, tragedy struck the library on September 15, 1932, when it mysteriously caught fire.  The final damage to the building and its contents, including the books, was estimated to be approximately $98,000 (or $1.6 million today). Afterwards, Mr. Charles H. Stone, the college Librarian, began the arduous task of rebuilding the damaged library collection. Books and materials that could be salvaged and saved were transported to the Students' Building while materials in the stacks were left in place, but were not accessible to students.\n\nThe Carnegie Library was rebuilt and remained the primary library on campus until June 1950 when the more than 134,000 books were moved to a new, larger library building across the street, later named in honor of former Chancellor Walter Clinton Jackson.    This older portion of the library still stands and houses much of the library administration and the special collections and university Archives. In 1964 the library became a federal document depository; it still retains the status as a selective depository for U.S. government documents, as well as a full depository for State documents. A nine-story tower addition was built to the main building in the 1970s, making it a landmark on campus.<ref>Trelease, Allen W. (2004) Making North Carolina Literate.

The Libraries house over one million printed volumes and provide access to more than 60,000 journals, more than 400,000 electronic books, and more than 360 electronic databases. The Digital Projects Team has created numerous digital collections, totaling more than 300,000 digital files, from the holdings of the University Libraries and other area institutions.\n\nThe Library Catalog of UNCG currently contains holdings for materials in the Walter Clinton Jackson Library, the Harold Schiffman Music Library, the Multicultural Resource Center, and the Teaching Resource Center. the holdings of Special Collections, Rare Books, and University Archives are increasingly available via the online catalog.\n\nThe Reference Collection is located in the ROI Department on the first floor of the Library's main wing. The collection consists of general and specialized encyclopedias, dictionaries, directories, and biographical sources. The Reference Collection also includes government reference sources, indexes and abstracts, telephone directories, and a map collection containing more than 12,000 items. Items do not circulate. The ROI Department's Subject Guides provide access to online and print resources on a variety of topics.\n\nThe Government Documents web pages provide extensive links to local, state, and national government information. The Government Documents collection is a part of the ROI Department.  Service is at the main Reference Desk on the 1st floor.  The collection includes both Federal and North Carolina documents.  The Library Catalog contains records of the Library's collection of Federal documents published after 1976 and NC State documents published after 1987.\n\nThe Harold Schiffman Music Library is located on the main level of the [[UNCG School of Music, Theatre and Dance|School of Music, Theatre and Dance]] building (corner of W Market and McIver Streets) and supports the educational, research, and service goals of the University by providing music resources, information, and services required by students, faculty, staff and community members. The collection consists of sound recordings, video recordings, scores, books and serials about music. Faculty, staff, and students are welcome to come to the Harold Schiffman Music Library to listen to and view sound and video materials and to check out books and scores.\n\nThe Martha Blakeney Hodges Special Collections and University Archives (SCUA) is located on the second floor of the Library's main wing.
