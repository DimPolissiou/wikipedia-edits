It is located 46&nbsp;km east of [[Piatra Neam\u021b]], in [[Neam\u021b County]] at the confluence of the [[Siret]] and [[Moldova river]]s.\n\nIts name was taken from [[Moldavia]]n [[Voivode]] [[Roman I of Moldavia]]. From here prince Roman has realized the centralization of Moldavia, Roman city being capital of Lower Country of Moldavia ({{lang-ro|Tara de Jos}}).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roman statuie roman i.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The statue of Roman I of Moldavia]]\nThe earliest mention of the city is in the [[Novgorod Chronicle]] (dated between 1387 and 1392). Five years later, the name appeared on a donation deed. The city is mentioned in a Moldavian document, signed by Moldavia's Voivode Roman I, on March 30. The document is one of the first of documents of the then-young state of Moldavia, being the first which holds a fully legible version of the Moldavia seal, bearing the aurochs, the moon, the star, and the flower, still in use on [[coat of arms of Moldova]].\n\nRoman became a diocesan see in September 14, 1408, when Voivode Roman I's son, [[Alexandru cel Bun]], established an orthodox bishopric in the city. The representatives of the Catholic population of Roman, shepherded by the Bishop of [[Baia]], attended the [[Council of Constance]] in 1412. \n\nLater on in the late 15th century, [[Stephen III of Moldavia|\u0218tefan cel Mare]] built a new stone fortress on the left bank of the Siret river, to replace the old earthen one. Several documents from 1458, 1465 and 1488 during \u015etefan's reign mention the Cathedral of Saint [[Parascheva of the Balkans|Paraskeva]] (Paraschiva) in Roman. In 1467, the fortress resisted the siege of the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] army under King [[Matthias Corvinus]], before the [[battle of Baia]]. In 1476, an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army, led by [[Mohamed II]], besieged the new fortress again, with the Moldavians retreating after the [[Battle of Valea Alb\u0103]].\n\n[[Petru Rare\u0219]] ordered the construction of a new [[episcopal see]] on the same spot in 1542. The old fortress was apparently destroyed by [[Dumitra\u0219cu Cantacuzino]], following Ottoman command, together with all other Moldavian fortresses. One of the last mentions of it dates back to 1561&ndash;1563 during the reign of [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid]]. The catholic community had its rights restored around the same time, in 1562, as Ioan Belusiu\u0219, an agent of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], wrote his master from Roman, after the severe limitations under [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]]. In 1623, the Catholic community was described by the [[Franciscan]] missionary Andreas Bogoslavici in a letter sent to [[Rome]], as Hungarian that understood and used [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. The Catholics appear to have a church dedicated to [[Saint Peter]].\n\nIn 1569, Lady [[Ruxandra L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] built an Orthodox church dedicated to the Holy Virgin (''Precista Mare'') on the same spot the [[eponym]] church is placed today. In 1595, the church ''Sfin\u021bii Voievozi'' was built. The current Armenian Orthodox Church was built in 1610.\n\nSome demographic data from 1641, recorded by the [[Vicar]] of [[Sofia]], who was passing through Roman, shows there were apparently 1,500 Eastern Orthodox, 450 [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Orthodox]] and 30 Hungarian Catholics.\n\nA major personality of the city was orthodox bishop [[Dosoftei]] who translated the [[Psalter]] into Romanian in 1665&ndash;1671.\nIn December 1691, [[Miron Costin]], one of the first historians and writers in Romanian, was decapitated here on the orders of Prince [[Constantin Cantemir]] ([[Dimitrie Cantemir]]'s father). Costin was in custody, being carried from [[B\u0103rbo\u0219i]] to [[Ia\u0219i]], where he hoped to prove his innocence; a few days earlier, the chronicler's brother had been killed in Ia\u0219i, being believed to have attempted to obtain the throne for himself.\n\nThe first hospital in Roman was built in 1798 on the place where the Municipal Hospital ''Precista Mare'' is located today. Talmud Torah, one of the first Jewish schools in [[Principality of Moldova]], was inaugurated in 1817, an important event in itself as Moldova did not grant citizenship to Jews.\n[[File:RO NT Roman railway station.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Roman railway station]]\n[[File:RO NT Roman Roman Voda gymnasium.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Roman Vod\u0103 College building]]\nRoman became a railway hub in the 19th century, when the second railway in Romania was opened in December 1869, from Roman to [[Suceava]] ([[Suceava North railway station|I\u021bcani]]). One year later, on December 27, 1870, The Bucharest-Gala\u0163i-Roman railway was also opened, linking Roman to the capital via [[M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]], [[Tecuci]], [[Gala\u021bi]], [[Br\u0103ila]] and [[Buz\u0103u]]. Right after the inauguration, this railway was closed due to technical problems, but it was reestablished on September 13, 1872. At the same time, after a reluctant government gave its long-waited approval, the first high school of the city, ''Roman-Vod\u0103'', was opened on September 30 in the building that is still in use today as that of School No. 1.\n\nIn the communist era, the city lost the county capital status, being included, in 1950-52 and 1956-68, in [[Bac\u0103u Region]], in 1952-56 in [[Ia\u0219i Region]], and then, in 1968, in [[Neam\u021b County]]. It also became the target of industrialization: in 1957, the steel tubes factory started production. Roman became an important industrial center in Romania.\n\nAfter the fall of communism, most of the heavy industry, relying strongly on state subsidies, went bankrupt and Roman's economy struggled. The steel tubes factory was privatized, and it is now owned by the [[Mittal Steel Company N.V.]], and the economy started to recover.\n\n==Geography and demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |18128\n|1930 |28823\n|1948 |23701\n|1956 |27948\n|1966 |39012\n|1977 |51132\n|1992 |80328\n|2002 |69483\n|2011 |50713\n}}\n\nRoman is located in north-eastern Romania, in [[Neam\u021b County]], in the historic region of [[Moldavia]], at the mouth of the [[Moldova River]], a tributary to the [[Siret River|Siret]].

It surprised him when an unauthorised edition appeared in 1642, since the work included several unorthodox religious speculations. An authorised text appeared in 1643, with some of the more controversial views removed. The expurgation did not end the controversy: in 1645, [[Alexander Ross (writer)|Alexander Ross]] attacked ''Religio Medici'' in his ''Medicus Medicatus'' ''(The Doctor, Doctored)'' and, in common with much Protestant literature, the book was placed upon the Papal ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' in the same year.<ref>J.

A sceptical work that debunks a number of legends circulating at the time in a methodical and witty manner, it displays the [[Francis Bacon|Baconian]] side of Browne&mdash;the side that was unafraid of what at the time was still called \"[[the new learning]]\".  The book is significant in the [[history of science]] because it promoted an awareness of up-to-date scientific journalism.\n\nBrowne's last publication during his lifetime were two philosophical Discourses which are closely related to each other in concept. The first, ''[[Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial|Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial, or a Brief Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns lately found in Norfolk]]'' (1658) inspired by the discovery of some [[Bronze Age]] burials in earthenware vessels found in [[Norfolk]], resulted in a literary meditation upon death, the [[funerary]] customs of the world and the ephemerality of fame. The other discourse in the [[diptych]] is antithetical in style, subject-matter and imagery. ''[[The Garden of Cyrus|The Garden of Cyrus, or The Quincuncial Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients, Artificially, Naturally, and Mystically Considered]]'' (1658) features the [[quincunx]] which is used by Browne to demonstrate evidence of [[Platonic realism|the Platonic forms]] in art and nature.<ref>Frank Huntley, Sir Thomas Browne : A biographical and Critical Study  Ann Arbor University of Michigan Press, 1962</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n=== Later life and knighthood ===\n[[File:Sir Thomas Browne's House, Norwich.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration of Sir Thomas Browne's house in Norwich]]\nIn ''Religio Medici'', Browne confirmed his belief, in accordance with the vast majority of seventeenth century European society, in the existence of [[angel]]s and [[witchcraft]].

The courtier [[John Evelyn]], who had occasionally corresponded with Browne, took good use of the royal visit to call upon \"the learned doctor\" of European fame and wrote of his visit, \"His whole house and garden is a paradise and Cabinet of rarities and that of the best collection, amongst Medails, books, Plants, natural things\".<ref>The Diary of John Evelyn ed.

With the dust of his alchemical body he converts lead into gold\". The origin of the invented word ''spagyrici'' are from the Greek of: ''Spao'' to tear open, + ''ageiro'' to collect, a signature neologism coined by [[Paracelsus]] to define his medicine-oriented alchemy; the origins of [[iatrochemistry]], being first advanced by him.\n\nBrowne's coffin-plate verse, along with the collected works of Paracelsus and several followers of the Swiss physician listed in his library, are evidence that although sometimes highly critical of Paracelsus, nevertheless, like the 'Luther of Medicine', he believed in [[palingenesis]], [[physiognomy]], [[alchemy]], [[astrology]] and the [[kabbalah]].<ref>Manchester Guardian 19 October 1905</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne]] was held in the care of his eldest son Edward until 1708.

The freshness and ingenuity of his mind invested everything he touched with interest; while on more important subjects his style, if frequently ornate and Latinate, often rises to the highest pitch of stately eloquence.  His [[paradox]]ical place in the [[history of ideas]], as equally, a devout Christian, a promoter of the new [[induction (philosophy)|inductive]] science and adherent of ancient [[esoteric]] learning,  have greatly contributed to his ambiguity in the history of ideas. For these reasons, one literary critic succinctly assessed him as \"an instance of scientific reason lit up by mysticism in the [[Church of England]]\".<ref>Sencourt R., ''Outflying Philosophy: A Literary Study of the Religious Element in the Poems and Letters of John Donne and in the Works of Sir Thomas Browne.'', Ardent Media, 1925, p. 126</ref> However, the complexity of Browne's labyrinthine thought processes, his highly stylised language, along with his many allusions to  Biblical, Classical and contemporary learning, along with esoteric authors, are each contributing factors for why he remains obscure, little-read and thus, misunderstood.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/sir_thomas_browne.html | title=The physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne}}</ref>\n\nBrowne appears at No. 69 in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''{{'}}s list of top cited sources.

A sceptical work that debunks a number of legends circulating at the time in a methodical and witty manner, it displays the [[Francis Bacon|Baconian]] side of Browne&mdash;the side that was unafraid of what at the time was still called \"[[the new learning]]\".  The book is significant in the [[history of science]] because it promoted an awareness of up-to-date scientific journalism.\n\nBrowne's last publication during his lifetime were two philosophical Discourses which are closely related to each other in concept. The first, ''[[Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial|Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial, or a Brief Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns lately found in Norfolk]]'' (1658) inspired by the discovery of some [[Bronze Age]] burials in earthenware vessels found in [[Norfolk]], resulted in a literary meditation upon death, the [[funerary]] customs of the world and the ephemerality of fame. The other discourse in the [[diptych]] is antithetical in style, subject-matter and imagery. ''[[The Garden of Cyrus|The Garden of Cyrus, or The Quincuncial Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients, Artificially, Naturally, and Mystically Considered]]'' (1658) features the [[quincunx]] which is used by Browne to demonstrate evidence of [[Platonic realism|the Platonic forms]] in art and nature.<ref>Frank Huntley, Sir Thomas Browne : A biographical and Critical Study  Ann Arbor University of Michigan Press, 1962</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n=== Later life and knighthood ===\n[[File:Sir Thomas Browne's House, Norwich.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration of Sir Thomas Browne's house in Norwich]]\nIn ''Religio Medici'', Browne confirmed his belief, in accordance with the vast majority of seventeenth century European society, in the existence of [[angel]]s and [[witchcraft]].

The courtier [[John Evelyn]], who had occasionally corresponded with Browne, took good use of the royal visit to call upon \"the learned doctor\" of European fame and wrote of his visit, \"His whole house and garden is a paradise and Cabinet of rarities and that of the best collection, amongst Medails, books, Plants, natural things\".<ref>The Diary of John Evelyn ed.

With the dust of his alchemical body he converts lead into gold\". The origin of the invented word ''spagyrici'' are from the Greek of: ''Spao'' to tear open, + ''ageiro'' to collect, a signature neologism coined by [[Paracelsus]] to define his medicine-oriented alchemy; the origins of [[iatrochemistry]], being first advanced by him.\n\nBrowne's coffin-plate verse, along with the collected works of Paracelsus and several followers of the Swiss physician listed in his library, are evidence that although sometimes highly critical of Paracelsus, nevertheless, like the 'Luther of Medicine', he believed in [[palingenesis]], [[physiognomy]], [[alchemy]], [[astrology]] and the [[kabbalah]].<ref>Manchester Guardian 19 October 1905</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne]] was held in the care of his eldest son Edward until 1708.

The freshness and ingenuity of his mind invested everything he touched with interest; while on more important subjects his style, if frequently ornate and Latinate, often rises to the highest pitch of stately eloquence.  His [[paradox]]ical place in the [[history of ideas]], as equally, a devout Christian, a promoter of the new [[induction (philosophy)|inductive]] science and adherent of ancient [[esoteric]] learning,  have greatly contributed to his ambiguity in the history of ideas. For these reasons, one literary critic succinctly assessed him as \"an instance of scientific reason lit up by mysticism in the [[Church of England]]\".<ref>Sencourt R., ''Outflying Philosophy: A Literary Study of the Religious Element in the Poems and Letters of John Donne and in the Works of Sir Thomas Browne.'', Ardent Media, 1925, p. 126</ref> However, the complexity of Browne's labyrinthine thought processes, his highly stylised language, along with his many allusions to  Biblical, Classical and contemporary learning, along with esoteric authors, are each contributing factors for why he remains obscure, little-read and thus, misunderstood.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/sir_thomas_browne.html | title=The physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne}}</ref>\n\nBrowne appears at No. 69 in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''{{'}}s list of top cited sources.

''Richelieu'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] in 1935 and was [[ship launching|launched]] in 1939, just before the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe. As war with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] became increasingly likely, work on the ship was rushed to prepare her for [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] in April 1940.\n\nCompleted just days before the Germans won the [[Battle of France]] in June, ''Richelieu'' fled to [[Dakar]] in [[French West Africa]] to keep her under French control. There, she came under repeated British attacks that had been intended to either compel the battleship to join the [[Free French Naval Forces]] or sink her; these included during [[Operation Catapult]] in July 1940 and the [[Battle of Dakar]] in September. Damaged in both attacks, the ship was slowly repaired before eventually being turned over to Free French control after the [[Operation Torch|Allied invasion of North Africa]] in November 1942. After being sent to the United States for repairs and an extensive modernization, the ship served with the British [[Home Fleet]] in early 1944 before being deployed to the [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Eastern Fleet]] for operations against the Japanese in the [[Indian Ocean]]. These included several bombardment operations and in May 1945 she was present during the [[Battle of the Malacca Strait]], though she was too far away to engage the Japanese ships before they were sunk.\n\n''Richelieu'' was part of the force that liberated [[Singapore]] following the [[Japanese surrender]] in September, and she thereafter operated in [[French Indochina]] as part of the initial effort to restore French colonial rule. Recalled to France in December 1945, she was repaired and modernized slightly in 1946. The ship saw relatively limited peacetime training in the immediate postwar years and in 1952, she was removed from active service for use as a gunnery [[training ship]]. In 1956, she was placed in [[reserve fleet|reserve]] and was thereafter used as a stationary training vessel and [[barracks ship]] until 1967, when the French Navy decided to discard her. Sold for [[scrap]] in 1968, she was [[ship breaking|broken up]] in Italy from 1968 to 1969.\n\n== Design==\n{{main|Richelieu-class battleship}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu-1.jpg|left|thumb|Recognition drawing of ''Richelieu'' in her original configuration]]\n\nWhen in 1934 [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] announced that it would begin building two {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship|1}}s armed with {{cvt|380|mm}} guns, the [[French Navy]] immediately began preparations to counter them. The small {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|1}}s that had been ordered provided the template for the next French battleship design, but it needed to be scaled up to match the new Italian vessels, both in terms of offensive and defensive characteristics. The design staff considered 380 and {{cvt|406|mm|0}} guns, but the latter could not be incorporated in a design that remained within the {{cvt|35000|LT|MT|-1|lk=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and was quickly discarded. The ''Dunkerque''s carried their armament in two quadruple [[gun turret]]s arrayed in a [[superfire|superfiring pair]] forward of the [[superstructure]], and the designers experimented with other arrangements, including combinations of triple and twin turrets, but the need to minimize the length of the armor belt (and thus its weight) necessitated the ''Dunkerque'' layout.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=94\u201397}}\n\n''Richelieu'' displaced {{convert|37250|LT|MT|abbr=on}} [[Standard displacement|standard]] and {{convert|44698|MT|LT|order=flip}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|247.85|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33.08|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. She was powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbines]] and six oil-fired Sural [[water-tube boiler]]s, which developed a total of {{convert|155000|shp|lk=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|32|kn|lk=in}}. At a cruising speed of {{convert|15|kn}}, the ship could steam for {{convert|9500|nmi|lk=in}}. Her crew numbered 1,569&nbsp;officers and men. The ship carried four [[Loire 130]] [[seaplane]]s on the [[quarterdeck]], and the aircraft facilities consisted of a steam [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] and a crane to handle the floatplanes.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=260}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=99\u2013101}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[380 mm/45 Mod\u00e8le 1935 gun|380 mm/45 Mod\u00e8le (Mle) 1935 guns]] arranged in two quadruple gun turrets,{{efn|/45 refers to the length of the gun in terms of [[caliber (artillery)|calibers]]; a /45 gun is 45 times long as it is in bore diameter.}} both of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward of the superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of nine [[Canon de 152 mm Mod\u00e8le 1930|{{convert|152|mm|abbr=on|0}} /55 Mle 1930 guns]] mounted in three triple turrets, arranged on the rear superstructure. Heavy [[anti-aircraft]] (AA) defense consisted of twelve {{cvt|100|mm}} /45 Mle 1930 anti-aircraft guns in twin turrets. Close range anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of eight [[Canon de 37 mm Mod\u00e8le 1925|{{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] guns in twin mounts and twenty [[Hotchkiss M1929 machine gun|{{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] machine guns in four quadruple and two twin mounts. The ship's [[belt armor]] was {{convert|330|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships, and the main battery turrets were protected by {{convert|430|mm|abbr=on}} of armor plate on the faces. The main armored deck was {{convert|170|mm|abbr=on}} thick, and the [[conning tower]] had {{convert|340|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=260}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=99}}\n\n== Service ==\n\n===Construction===\nThe contract for ''Richelieu'' was awarded to the [[Arsenal de Brest]] on 31 August 1935, and the [[keel]] for the new ship was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 22 October in the No. 4 dock that had recently built {{ship|French battleship|Dunkerque||2}}. The [[slipway]] was not long enough to accommodate the entire length of the new battleship, and so the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] had to be built in pieces. The main section of the hull, which amounted to {{cvt|197|m}}, was built on the slipway, while a {{cvt|43|m}} length of the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and an {{cvt|8|m}} length of her [[stern]] were built elsewhere and attached after the rest of the ship was [[ship launching|launched]] on 17 January 1939. The French decision to lay down ''Richelieu'' in 1935 put the country in violation of the Washington Treaty, which was to expire on 31 December 1936, as the combined tonnage of the two ''Dunkerque''s and ''Richelieu'' exceeded the {{cvt|70000|LT|MT}} that had been allotted to France during the moratorium on new battleship construction. France used the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]], which Britain had unilaterally signed with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in June 1935 to dismiss British objections to the new ship, though they nevertheless slowed construction of ''Richelieu'' to ease British concerns. Work was also slowed by [[Strike action|strikes]] in the shipyards for better pay and working conditions.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=260}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=98, 122}}\n\nBy the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, the hull had been assembled; the start of the war led the naval command to decide to slow work on other, less complete vessels to focus efforts on ''Richelieu'' and her [[sister ship]] {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1940|2}}. The ship began initial testing on 15 October while still [[fitting-out]] in an effort to rush the ship into service; the same day, the ship's first commander, [[Ship-of-the-line captain|''Capitaine de vaisseau'']] (''CV''\u2014Ship-of-the-line captain) Marzin came aboard. Engine testing began on 14 January 1940, and a week later her main battery was completed when the last barrel was installed. Further engine testing was carried out between 31 March and 7 April; during this period, she was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 1 April. Formal [[sea trial|acceptance trials]] began on 14 April. Repair work was conducted in [[Brest, France|Brest]] from 19 to 27 May, and fire control equipment for the main and secondary batteries were installed. ''Richelieu'' conducted full power trials on 13 June, reaching {{convert|32.63|kn}} from {{cvt|179000|shp}}, exceeding her design performance. Test firings of the guns were conducted on 13 and 14 June. Work on the ship was completed on 15 June 1940, days before France surrendered to Germany after the [[Battle of France]].{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\n===World War II===\n====Under Vichy control: 1940\u20131942====\nWith German troops advancing across France by mid-June, the Navy decided to evacuate ''Richelieu'' to [[Dakar]] in [[French West Africa]]; while earlier plans had been to send the fleet to British ports to continue the war, when the possibility of a negotiated armistice arose, the government decided that the fleet would be a useful bargaining chip. As a result, vessels should be preserved under French control, away from German occupation. At 06:45, the ship took on a load of ammunition and fuel, though she received only 198&nbsp;quarter charges of propellant for her main battery, which amounted to powder sufficient for 49&nbsp;shots. Material that had not yet been installed was also hastily loaded onto the ship, to be fitted once ''Richelieu'' reached the safety of Dakar. She also took aboard gold reserves from the [[Bank of France]] and 250&nbsp;cadets from the ''[[\u00c9cole Navale]]'' (Naval Academy). There was insufficient time to allow the full complement to assemble and board the ship, and at 04:00 the next morning, ''Richelieu'' got underway while German troops approached Brest. ''Richelieu'' steamed in company with the [[destroyer]]s {{ship|French destroyer|Fougueux||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Frondeur||2}} while German aircraft made several ineffective attacks against the ships. The battleship's anti-aircraft guns returned fire without success. Initially cruising at a speed of {{cvt|22|kn}}, boiler trouble forced the ships to decrease speed to {{cvt|18|kn}}. The motors for her [[rudder]] also repeatedly broke down on the voyage, though the crew was able to repair them. While cruising off [[Casablanca]], [[French Morocco]] at 17:00 on 20 June, the torpedo boats were detached to refuel, their place being taken by the new destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Fleuret|1938|2}}. The two vessels then proceeded on to Dakar, where they arrived at 17:44 on 23 June.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=124\u2013125}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=29}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' in Dakar in 1940]]\n\nOn arriving in Dakar, an uneasy situation confronted ''Richelieu'' while armistice negotiations were still underway. The commander of French naval forces in the region, ''[[Contre-amiral]]'' (''CA''\u2014Rear Admiral) Plan\u00e7on and the [[governor-general]] of French West Africa, [[:fr:L\u00e9on Cayla|L\u00e9on Cayla]], were inclined to remain in the war against Germany. Also, significant British naval units were in the area, including the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} moored in Dakar and the British South Atlantic Squadron, which was nearby. At the same time, ''Richelieu'' had used half of her fuel to escape Brest, and she could perform little sustained firing of her main or secondary guns. Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]], the [[Chief of Staff of the French Navy]], sent a telegraph on the night of 23\u201324 June to warn Marzin that the British might attack the vessel to neutralize it in the event of a French surrender, and ordered him to begin preparations to [[scuttling|scuttle]] the ship if the need arose. Meanwhile, on 23 June, the British heavy cruiser {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|2}} departed [[Freetown]] to observe ''Richelieu''{{'}}s activities in Dakar.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=29}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=125}}\n\nOn 25 June, Marzin received word that the French government had signed the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|Armistice with Germany]]. Darlan instructed him that the ship was to remain under French control, and if that proved to be impossible, he was to scuttle the ship or attempt to escape to the then-neutral United States. Marzin decided that, given the threat of British warships in the area, the best course of action was to try to escape to Casablanca and join the French fleet there, and so at 14:30 ''Richelieu'' got underway in company with ''Fleuret''. ''Hermes'' raised anchor as well and began to follow ''Richelieu'' with her [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s on her [[flight deck]], but the coastal artillery trained their guns on the ship, convincing ''Hermes''{{'}} commander to return to port. ''Dorsetshire'' nevertheless shadowed ''Richelieu'' while she was at sea. The next morning, Darlan, who feared that Marzin was trying to defect to the [[Free French forces]], ordered him to return to Dakar. Marzin complied and turned the ships back to port, but while on the way, he received amended orders instructing him to wait some {{cvt|120|nmi}} north of [[Cape Verde]] to escort the 1st Division of Armed Merchant Cruisers to Dakar, as they were carrying another load of gold reserves from the Bank of France. ''Richelieu'' failed to make contact at the prescribed rendezvous point, and since she had not embarked any of her floatplanes before fleeing Brest, she could not conduct an aerial search. Marzin instead returned to Dakar on 28 June; the convoy arrived, having been significantly delayed, on 4 July.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=29}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nAfter returning to port, work began to prepare the ship for action as quickly as possible. Marzin ordered that a stockpile of 330&nbsp;mm propellant charges that had been stocked for the battleship {{ship|French battleship|Strasbourg||2}} before France's surrender to be converted into charges that were usable by ''Richelieu''. The secondary guns were readied for action ten days later, but they lacked a director capable of tracking aerial targets, so they could be used against surface ships only. Under the terms of the armistice, ''Richelieu'' was to be returned to Toulon, where she would be demobilized, though the Germans later decided against permitting the move, as they feared the British would try to seize the ship during the passage through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]; the British, meanwhile, were under the mistaken impression that the Germans sought to seize the French fleet for their own use. This led to [[Operation Catapult]], a series of attacks on French warships to neutralize vessels that would not defect to the Free French.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=72, 126}}\n\n=====British attack on 8 July 1940 and repairs=====\n\n[[File:HMS Hermes June 1940.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Hermes'' (centre) and ''Dorsetshire'' (background) off Dakar during the operation against ''Richelieu'']]\n\nThe component of Catapult that targeted ''Richelieu'' consisted of the carrier ''Hermes'', which joined the cruisers {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}} and ''Dorsetshire'' off Dakar. On 4 July, the day after the British had [[attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|attacked Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]], Plan\u00e7on ordered the [[submarine]]s {{ship|French submarine|Le Glorieux||2}} and {{ship|French submarine|Le H\u00e9ros||2}} to attack ''Dorsetshire'' while it cruised off the port. He also instructed the coastal batteries to open fire if she closed to within {{cvt|15|km}}, though ''Dorsetshire'' remained at a distance. Marzin moved ''Richelieu'' to a position near the island of [[Gor\u00e9e]], pointed south so that the ship's main battery could aim at any vessels that approached Dakar. The British had intended to send [[Force H]] to Dakar after the attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, but the need to return to destroy ''Dunkerque'' forced the British to resort to ''Hermes''; on 7 July, the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Milford|L51|6}} was sent to contact Plan\u00e7on and issue the ultimatum to either surrender his ship to British control or be sunk.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=126}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=32}}\n\nMarzin prepared his ship to sortie the next morning; he intended to use the eight rounds loaded in his main guns to attack ''Hermes''. Other forces in Dakar were put on alert and ''Le H\u00e9ros'' again sortied to assist in the attack. While the French preparations were ongoing, the British sent a motorboat from ''Milford'' to drop four [[depth charge]]s under ''Richelieu''{{'}}s stern to disable her screws, though this attempt failed. At 04:15, a group of Swordfish launched from ''Hermes'' as ''Richelieu'' was about to get underway. One of their torpedoes struck the ship aft on the [[starboard]] side and tore a hole that was {{cvt|9.3|by|8.5|m}} between the propeller shafts. The resulting shock disabled many of the ship's systems. Two of her fire control directors were knocked off their tracks, the starboard propeller shafts were bent, and the blast caused significant flooding. Damage control teams pumped fuel out of the bunkers to counteract the loss of buoyancy aft and the ship was towed into port for repairs. [[Anti-torpedo net]]s were set up around the vessel, which had taken on some {{cvt|2400|t|LT}} of water and at low tide rested on the harbor bottom.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=32}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=127}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nLater that afternoon, [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]] came alongside and began pumping oil out of the ship's bunkers to reduce her draft, but water continued to leak into the hull through the cable tunnels. Pumps attached to the ship helped to control the flooding, but the hoses repeatedly pulled loose as ''Richelieu'' rose and fell with the waves. To further complicate the effort to repair the ship, Dakar lacked a dry dock sufficient to accommodate ''Richelieu''; the battleship could not simply be drained and plated over. Instead, damaged [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] had to be patched and pumped out individually; by 28 August, some {{cvt|1300|t|LT}} of water remained aboard the ship. Heavy use of the pumps caused frequent breakdowns, which further slowed work. In his report on the attack and subsequent repairs, Marin criticized faulty design and construction practices that hindered damage control efforts, including insufficient pumping equipment, poor quality control for the welding of bulkheads, and a failure to ensure that critical components like the turret trunks were watertight.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=128, 137}}\n\nWhile work to control and reverse the flooding was ongoing, other repairs were necessary to return the ship to operational status. The fire-control directors needed to be re-seated in their tracks, wiring that had been damaged by flooding or leaking fuel oil had to be replaced, and several of the electrical generators, which had been badly shaken by the blast, needed to be rebuilt. Given the limited ability to repair the damage to the ship, Marzin focused efforts on ensuring that the main and secondary batteries could be effectively used, even if the ship could only be employed as a static [[floating battery]] against an expected second attack from British forces. ''[[Amiral]]'' (Admiral) [[Jean de Laborde]] flew to Dakar to conduct an inspection and help to organize the defenses. As part of these preparations, both Plan\u00e7on and Cayla, who were suspected of being pro-British, were removed from their posts, with Plan\u00e7on's place taken by ''CA'' Platon and then ''CA'' Landriau.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nWorkers in the local shipyard scavenged metal from other ships in the harbor to fabricate an {{cvt|11.5|m}} square patch to cover the torpedo hole, which was planned to be installed by 10 September. This would allow the rear [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]] for the 152&nbsp;mm and 37&nbsp;mm guns to be drained. At the same time, the shipyard began building a steel [[cofferdam]] around the ship that was to have been completed by late October, which would allow the rest of the hull to be pumped dry. With the hull pumped out, permanent repairs were to have been completed by January 1941. While this work was being carried out, the crew cleaned and painted the ship and continued to work on readying the armament. A total of 150 complete charges for the main battery were created by remanufacturing the stockpile intended for ''Strasbourg''. Parts of the crew were dispersed for other tasks: 106 were sent to man the armed merchant cruisers in the harbor, whose reservist crews had to be demobilized, and the 64-man crew of the forward gun turret were sent to man the coastal battery at [[Cap Manuel]]. After another 132&nbsp;reservists from ''Richelieu'' were demobilized, a total of 1,039&nbsp;officers and men were left aboard the ship. The 100-, 37-, and 13.2&nbsp;mm guns were kept manned continuously given the threat of further British air attacks.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\n=====Battle of Dakar=====\n[[File:HMS Barham FL1472.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Barham|04|6}}, ''Richelieu''{{'}}s primary opponent during the battle]]\n{{main|Battle of Dakar}}\n\nWhile repairs were being carried out in August, the British began preparations for another attack, code-named Operation Menace. British [[Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] sought to use a contingent of Free French forces led by [[Charles de Gaulle]] to invade the colony and seize the ship for use against Germany. By late August, a [[convoy]] had been assembled with five ships carrying weapons and supplies got underway, later rendezvousing with a second convoy of six [[troop ship]]s carrying some 2,400&nbsp;Free French soldiers and 4,270&nbsp;British soldiers. The naval support force consisted of the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} and the battleships {{HMS|Barham|04|2}} and {{HMS|Resolution|09|2}}, along with four cruisers and numerous other warships. The plan called for de Gaulle to use his French forces to attempt to secure the colony, only calling on British support if the Vichy forces resisted him. At the same time, several French colonies in Africa defected to Free France, prompting the Vichy government to secure authorization from the [[German Armistice Commission]] to send several [[light cruiser]]s and destroyers to reinforce their holdings in Africa, designated Force Y. Owing to the risk of encountering British vessels on the passage, the destroyers were temporarily left in Casablanca while the three cruisers, carrying supplies and additional men to crew the coastal batteries, raced south at high speed. They reached Dakar on 14 September, and after disembarking the men and supplies, continued on south to [[French Equatorial Africa]] (in what is now present-day Gabon).{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=139\u2013141}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}\n\nThe British believed that the arrival of Force Y indicated that the French were aware of Operation Menace, but de Gaulle decided to proceed with the attack regardless. While Force Y steamed south, two of the three cruisers were intercepted by British cruisers and forced to fall back to Dakar, arriving there again on 20 September, by which time the destroyers had arrived. On 22 September, the liner {{SS|Banfora}} was due to arrive with a load of 380&nbsp;mm shells, and as a result, French search aircraft were arrayed to the north to cover the liner's approach; they were completely surprised by the arrival of the Anglo-Free French force on the morning of 23 September. A small party of Free French troops sent to rally the port to de Gaulle was repulsed with machine-gun fire and ''Richelieu''{{'}}s 100&nbsp;mm guns fired warning shots toward the Free French [[aviso]] {{ship|French aviso|Savorgnan de Brazza||2}} shortly after 07:00. On the approach of the sloops {{ship|French sloop|Commandant Domin\u00e9||2}} and {{ship|French sloop|Commandant Duboc||2}} at 08:10, ''Richelieu'' again fired warning shots from her 100&nbsp;mm guns. The British warships approached the port and came under fire from the coastal batteries, leading the Anglo-Free French commanders, de Gaulle and Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]] to conclude that they would have to directly attack the port if the operation was to succeed.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=141}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=109\u2013114}}\n\n''Barham'' and ''Resolution'' opened fire on ''Richelieu'' at 11:05, but poor visibility hampered the British shooting and they checked fire after twenty minutes, having inflicted only splinter damage to the cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Montcalm|1935|2}} and the destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Le Malin||2}}. The French coastal batteries hit several of the cruisers and destroyers, but ''Richelieu'' was moored facing north, which prevented her from taking part in the initial duel. Following the British withdrawal, Marzin used [[tugboat]]s to turn the ship far enough to enable her to bring her main battery to bear. The defenses of Dakar now alerted, the Free French then attempted to land further east at [[Rufisque]], but the landing there was repulsed as well. The British and Free French withdrew to regroup for another attack the next day. Between 06:25 and 08:00 on 24 September, the British launched three strikes with Swordfish and [[Blackburn Skua]] bombers. These attacks scored no hits on ''Richelieu'' owing to poor visibility, though they made several near-misses that inflicted no damage. In return, ''Richelieu''{{'}}s gunners claimed three of the six aircraft that were shot down, and damaged another. An hour and a half later, the British battleships and two [[heavy cruiser]]s approached and took ''Richelieu'' under fire with their 380&nbsp;mm main batteries.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=141\u2013142}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=137\u2013139}}\n\n''Richelieu'' returned fire at 09:40, but her No. 7 gun was destroyed by a shell that detonated in the barrel and the No. 8 gun was also badly damaged. This was first traced to the use of the remanufactured propellant from ''Strasbourg'', but during a later inquiry in 1941, it was determined that the explosions were caused by a flaw in the design of the shell base.{{sfn|Dumas|pp=77\u201378}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=143, 149}} Guns Nos. 5 and 6 remained in action but they failed to score any hits. At 09:57, one of ''Richelieu''{{'}}s secondary guns hit ''Barham'', though the British ships inflicted little damage in return, apart from minor splinter damage before breaking off at 10:07. During this period, the French counted some 160 shells that hit near the ship, but they did little damage. The French then laid smoke screens to obscure ''Richelieu'' before the British returned to the action at 12:53, initially targeting a destroyer before bombarding the port for the next half an hour. ''Richelieu'' was not struck in the barrage, during which at 12:56, she used guns 5 and 6 to engage the British cruisers, quickly straddling one of them and convincing them to disengage. She fired four 380&nbsp;mm shells at ''Barham'' at 13:11\u201313:12 but failed to hit with any, though both British battleships had been hit several times by the coastal batteries. After disengaging for the day, de Gaulle decided to abandon the operation, but Cunningham convinced him to allow a final attempt the next morning. In the meantime, Marzin decided to transfer the crews from turret 2 to turret 1, which also required moving the shells and propellant between magazines.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=143\u2013145}}{{sfn|Williams|p=140}}\n\nAs the British approached on the morning of 25 September, Marzin decided to engage ''Barham'' with his main battery and ''Resolution'' with his 152&nbsp;mm guns. While the British were approaching their bombardment positions, ''Richelieu'' shot down one of the reconnaissance planes shortly before 07:00. She opened fire at 09:04 with her main battery, firing two shots that fell short, and the coastal guns and Force Y cruisers followed suit shortly thereafter. While the British battleships were turning to unmask their rear guns, the submarine {{ship|French submarine|B\u00e9v\u00e9ziers|1935|2}} torpedoed and badly damaged ''Resolution''. ''Barham'' avoided the torpedoes and opened fire, quickly straddling ''Richelieu'' and at 09:15, she scored a hit [[amidships]] that penetrated above the side armor, though it caused no casualties. In return, ''Richelieu'' hit ''Barham'' in the bow, but it did little damage. At 09:25, the British disengaged to cover ''Resolution''{{'}}s withdrawal. After the British were gone, the gun crew attempted to clear the shells that had been loaded in guns 5 and 6 and the shell in No. 5 also exploded, leaving No. 6 the only operable gun in the turret. In total, French warships in the harbor lost 100&nbsp;dead and 182&nbsp;wounded, while another 84 were killed and 197 wounded among the civilian population.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=147}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=152\u2013154}}\n\nBeginning on 29 September, the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}} and escorting destroyers were detached from Force H to patrol off Dakar, as the British believed ''Richelieu'' would be transferred to [[metropolitan France]] for repairs. The British ships remained in the area until 1 October when it became clear that the ship would not be moved.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=43}}\n\n=====Repairs and defection to Free France=====\n[[File:Richelieu-3.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' at Dakar in 1941]]\n\nRepair work resumed immediately. The hit from ''Barham'' did little serious damage to the ship, but it nevertheless caused extensive deformation of interior bulkheads, the armor deck was forced down where the shell hit it, and the uptakes from the boilers were damaged. Wiring in the area was also cut by fragments and needed to be replaced. On 10 October, the workers attempted to attach the patch that had been manufactured, but it did not work; it did not create a watertight seal, which meant the compartments could not be pumped out. The patch was abandoned in the hopes that the cofferdam, then nearing completion, would work. The cofferdam was modeled to conform to the hull and was built with an interior void that could be used as a [[ballast tank]] so it could be floated in position and sunk in place. The cofferdam was ready by late December, which allowed the hull to be pumped dry and then sealed with welded plates and cement; the hull was finally sealed by 28 February 1941. Further repairs were hampered by the German Armistice Commission, which attempted to slow progress to prevent the ship from returning to full operational status. They blocked the shipment of new guns or a new propeller shaft, and severely constrained the transfer of other equipment. During this period, on 27 February, ''CV'' Deramond replaced Marzin as the ship's commander.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=125, 147\u2013149}}\n\nAs repairs were carried out, the ship saw little activity through late 1942 apart from engaging unidentified aircraft on 28 July and 29 September 1941 and 26 February and 12 May 1942.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=150}} During this period, in April 1941, the ship received the first [[radar]] set installed on a French battleship. And in July, her Loire seaplanes finally arrived; tests with the catapults were conducted in October.{{sfn|Dumas|pp=34, 50}} On 10 April 1942, the ship conducted a test firing with gun No. 6 to demonstrate that the shell design problem had been corrected; all six shells were fired without incident. On 8 November, American and British forces landed in French North Africa (code-named [[Operation Torch]]), which prompted the Germans to invade the rest of Vichy France, which in turn led Darlan to defect to the Allies with the rest of the fleet.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=150}}\n\nThe [[United States Navy]] sent a group to evaluate the ships under Darlan's control to determine which should be modernized in the United States. The only French battleship still in service, ''Richelieu'' was an obvious candidate. The US Navy had not initially been interested in repairing ''Richelieu''; while the Germans and Italians retained a number of powerful battleships, the United States had recently commissioned or would soon complete eight fast battleships, more than sufficient to cover US requirements for the [[Pacific War]] and to send to Europe to reinforce the [[Royal Navy]]. In addition, repairing and modernizing a ship the size of ''Richelieu'' would require significant resources that could be used for other purposes. But pressure from Britain and the Free French convinced the Navy to agree to the project. For France, she was the only surviving modern battleship and thus a major symbol of national prestige, while the British had long sought to acquire the vessel to stiffen the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], which at that time had just two new battleships to oppose their three Italian counterparts.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=150, 181}}\n\n[[File:French battleship Richelieu in New York.jpg|thumb|''Richelieu'' in the United States for repairs]]\n\nShe ran sea trials from 25 to 29 January 1943 to evaluate the state of her engines, which had not been used since July 1940. Her aircraft facilities and anti-aircraft armament were removed during the evaluation period, as they would be replaced by US equipment. On 30 January, she departed Dakar with ''Montcalm'', bound for New York City, where both vessels would be modernized. ''Richelieu'' steamed at a speed of {{cvt|14|kn}} and her rudder had to be held to seven degrees to account for the hull deformation. The ships arrived on 11 February and on the 18th, ''Richelieu'' was taken into Dock No. 5 at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] to begin the modernization.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=150}}{{sfn|Dumas|pp=37, 50}}\n\n====Free-French career: 1943\u20131945====\n=====Refit in New York City=====\nPolitical tensions between the United States and France played a major role in determining how much ''Richelieu'' would be modernized. The US Navy refused to transfer the latest radar equipment on the basis that it was too sensitive to be released. As a result, much of the improvement was limited to the installation of a new anti-aircraft battery of the latest US weapons and auxiliary equipment in addition to a thorough overhaul and permanent repairs to the torpedo damage. Three shifts of workers, totaling some 2,000&nbsp;men, worked on the ship twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, for five months to rush the ship back into service. The modifications to the ship increased her displacement by about {{cvt|3000|t|LT}}. While the ship was being modernized, ''CV'' Lambert replaced Deramont as the ship's commander on 29 April.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=125, 181\u2013182, 186}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu Ney York.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' arrives in New York with her damaged turret. The uppermost fire control director on the fore tower had to be dismantled for her to pass under the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to the [[New York Navy Yard]]]]\n\nThe ship's armament required extensive repairs and modifications to bring ''Richelieu'' up to modern standards. First, three of the eight main battery guns had to be replaced, which required removing the turret roof. Since the gun cradles were undamaged, the guns were simply replaced by barrels taken from ''Jean Bart'', which had been recovered at Casablanca during Operation Torch. The shell handling equipment of both the primary and secondary guns was thoroughly overhauled, with wiring being replaced and the shell and propellant lifts being rebuilt\u2014the latter had never been made to function correctly while the ship was in Dakar. Ammunition for the primary and secondary guns was now a problem, as the source, factories in France, was occupied by German forces. Drawings of the plans for the 380&nbsp;mm shells were prepared in Dakar and forwarded to the United States, where a contract to produce 930&nbsp;shells was ordered from [[Crucible Industries|Crucible Steel]]. American 6-inch/47 Mk&nbsp;16 shells were used as a starting point to supply the 152&nbsp;mm guns, as they were the same caliber and required relatively minor modifications for use in the French weapons.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nHer 100&nbsp;mm guns were retained, but her light anti-aircraft battery now consisted of fifty-six [[Bofors 40 mm gun|{{cvt|40|mm}} Bofors guns]] in quadruple mounts, all placed with their own Mk&nbsp;51 gun director. These were arranged with two abreast the superfiring turret, two on either side of the forward tower, another two per side of the aft tower, and the remaining four on the [[quarterdeck]], where the aircraft catapults had been. These guns were supplemented with fifty [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{cvt|20|mm}} Oerlikon cannons]], all in individual or twin mounts. Nine were placed on the [[forecastle]] aft of the [[Breakwater (ship)|breakwater]], four were mounted on the superfiring turret, nine were placed on the former aircraft hangar, with the rest dispersed around the superstructure, including on the towers and the shelter deck.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186\u2013188}}\n\n''Richelieu''{{'}}s tower foremast was heavily reconfigured; the upper main battery director (which had never been operational) had been removed to allow the ship to clear the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], was left off. In its place, the [[radome]] for the SF surface search radar was installed, along with the mattress antenna for the SA-2 [[air search radar]]; these were short-range sets that had been designed for small craft, the SA-2 intended for [[PT boat]]s. Most of the command spaces in the tower were converted for other uses. The fire control systems for the main battery had to be replaced and those for the secondary guns were repaired with new wiring and telephones. The ship's original [[Hermann Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe|Ansch\u00fctz]] [[gyrocompass]]es were replaced with [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] models. The ship's propulsion system was thoroughly overhauled: the turbines were thoroughly repaired and the boilers were re-tubed. Much of the wiring throughout the ship was replaced, and a [[degaussing]] cable was installed.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186, 188\u2013189}}\n\nTo repair the hull, the concrete was broken up and removed, the sections that had been most badly damaged by the torpedo were stripped of all fittings, and deformed bulkheads and plating were cut out. After more than two and a half years without being dry-docked in a tropical port, the hull needed maintenance beyond simply repairing the torpedo damage, though given the conditions to which it had been subjected, it was in fairly good condition. It was sandblasted and those sections of plating that exhibited pitting had new plates welded over top. The starboard propeller shafts also required repairs: the mounting brackets were straightened, but the inboard shaft was too badly damaged and had to be replaced. [[Bethlehem Steel]] fabricated a replacement that was installed in June. The bottom row of [[porthole]]s were closed off, as the increase in displacement pushed them closer to the waterline.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=182}}\n\nBeginning in late August and continuing into mid-September, ''Richelieu'' began firing trials in the [[Chesapeake Bay]]; firing the main battery forward on 29 August revealed the need for a blast screen to protect the forecastle 20&nbsp;mm guns, as the test accidentally destroyed two of the guns and their ammunition lockers. With her normal displacement now at {{cvt|43600|t|LT}} and her hull slightly bowed (possibly caused by the torpedo hit), ''Richelieu'' began machinery trials in late September. On 25 September, the ship reached her new top speed of {{cvt|31.5|kn}}, cruising at that speed for thirty minutes, despite the deformation of her hull and the significant increase in displacement. The following day, she steamed for six hours at {{cvt|26.5|kn}}, for two hours at {{cvt|28.9|kn}}, and finally for fifty minutes at {{cvt|30.2|kn}}.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186, 188}}\n\nAs completed, the ship's displacement had grown to {{cvt|43957|t|LT}} normally and {{cvt|47728|t|LT}} fully loaded; draft correspondingly increased to {{cvt|9.22|m}} and {{cvt|10.68|m|0}}, respectively. Compared to her original wartime crew of 1,569&nbsp;officers and men, ''Richelieu'' was now to be manned by a total of 1,930, amounting to 86&nbsp;officers, 287&nbsp;[[petty officer]]s, and 1,557&nbsp;men. The major increase in complement was largely the result of the additional anti-aircraft guns and radar systems. The ship conducted further trials into October, and on the 14th the ship was finally ready to get underway for European waters.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=189}}\n\n=====In European waters=====\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A20935-colourised.jpg|left|thumb|Anti-aircraft gunners aboard ''Richelieu'' during target practice with the British fleet]]\n\nEscorted by the destroyers {{USS|Tarbell}} and {{USS|Ellet||2}}, ''Richelieu'' departed the US on 14 October, nominally bound for [[Gibraltar]]. The destroyers departed while underway, allowing ''Richelieu'' to keep up a speed of {{convert|24|kn}} in heavy seas. The ship stopped in the [[Azores]], Portugal, where she met the French destroyers {{ship|French destroyer|Le Fantasque||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Le Terrible||2}} and the British destroyer {{HMS|Active|H14|2}}, which was limited to a speed of {{cvt|20|kn}}; ''Active'' quickly left the group, which proceeded not to Gibraltar, but to [[Mers El K\u00e9bir]]. There, she replenished supplies; it had been intended to deploy the ship with the Mediterranean Fleet, but Italy had surrendered in September, removing the threat posed by the Italian ''Littorio''-class battleships. ''Richelieu'' was instead sent north to join the [[Home Fleet]], which included the four surviving {{sclass-|King George V|battleship|1||1939}}s. When ''Richelieu'' departed the Mediterranean, Cunningham, now the commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, recommended to the Admiralty that she be fitted with gunnery radars. The ship was escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Musketeer|G86|6}} and {{HMS|Scourge|G01|6}}, and on arrival in [[Scapa Flow]], Admiral [[Bruce Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of North Cape|Bruce Fraser]], the Home Fleet commander, inspected the battleship on 24 November. Work began immediately on installing a Type&nbsp;284 gunnery radar while the ship began an intensive period of training to acclimate the ship's crew to operating with British units.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=190}}\n\nThe ship saw little activity over the winter of 1943\u20131944 until February 1944, when she took part in [[Operation Posthorn]]. ''Richelieu'', the battleship {{HMS|Anson|79|2}}, and the carrier {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} departed Scapa Flow on 10 February for a raid on German shipping off occupied Norway. The objective was to lure the German heavy cruisers in the area so that the two battleships could destroy them. The carrier aircraft achieved little, sinking a single [[Cargo ship|freighter]] of 3,000&nbsp;tons and damaging a [[repair ship]] while trading one of the [[Supermarine Seafire]] [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] for a German [[Bf 109]] fighter. The fleet returned to port on the 12th, and ''Richelieu'' thereafter went to [[Rosyth]] for ten days to rest the crew. A repeat sweep was to have taken place at the end of the month, but two of the escorting destroyers collided while leaving Scapa Flow, leading to a postponement that became permanent as a result of bad weather. In March, the Allies determined that five battleships to counter the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} (which had been damaged in September 1943) was excessive. As a result, ''Richelieu'' was detached for other operations. The Allied command initially considered employing her to support the [[invasion of Normandy]], but as she was only supplied with armor-piercing shells, she was instead sent to reinforce the British [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Eastern Fleet]], along with a group of [[escort aircraft carrier]]s.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=190\u2013191}}{{sfn|Rohwer|pp=307, 313}}\n\nThe ship accordingly steamed to [[Greenock]] to take on fuel and ammunition, before cruising south to the Mediterranean with an escort of three British destroyers. She stopped in [[Algiers]] on 26 March to take on additional supplies; there, she was visited by General [[Henri Giraud]] and Admiral [[Andr\u00e9 Lemonnier]]. ''Richelieu'' thereafter departed for the [[Suez Canal]], steaming at a speed of {{cvt|25|kn}}; while underway, she began to experience significant boiler problems. The boiler blowers were not providing sufficient oxygen, so the boilers were not fully burning the fuel. As a result, the boiler tubes quickly became fouled and caused overheating. ''Richelieu'' stopped in [[Aden]] for repairs to the boiler tubes, but the problem was not corrected.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=192}}\n\n=====First deployment with the British Eastern Fleet=====\n[[File:Renown-9.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' (top left) with the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} (center) and the battleship {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} (top right) during [[Operation Transom]] on 12 May 1944]]\n\nOn entering the [[Indian Ocean]], ''Richelieu'' picked up an escort consisting of the destroyers {{HMS|Rotherham||2}}, {{HMS|Racehorse|H11|2}}, and {{HMS|Quadrant||2}}. The four ships arrived in [[Trincomalee]], [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] on 10 April, where they joined an Allied fleet that included the carriers {{HMS|Illustrious|87|2}} and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}, the battleships {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} and {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|2}}, and numerous cruisers and destroyers, commanded by Admiral [[James Somerville]]. On 16 April, the Eastern Fleet got underway for [[Operation Cockpit]], a diversionary raid to distract the Japanese while American forces [[Battle of Hollandia|landed at Hollandia]] in [[New Guinea]]. Somerville divided his fleet into two squadrons; ''Richelieu'' served in Force 69, the main element, with ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Valiant'', while ''Renown'' operated with the two carriers. The plan for Operation Cockpit called for carrier strikes on the port of [[Sabang, Indonesia|Sabang]], [[Netherlands East Indies]]. The fleet arrived in position early on 19 April, and after the carrier aircraft struck the port, Japanese bombers counter-attacked and ''Richelieu'' engaged the aircraft with her 100&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm batteries.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=192\u2013193}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=319}}\n\nThe next major operation conducted by the Eastern Fleet, [[Operation Transom]], was timed to coincide with American operations in the Central Pacific to keep the attention of the Japanese fleet based in [[Singapore]] focused away from the American fleet. For this operation, the target was the major base at [[Surabaya]], which also had significant oil refinery facilities. The Eastern Fleet got underway on 7 May and stopped to refuel on 15 May before arriving two days later. The strike proceeded uneventfully for ''Richelieu'' and on 18 May the American contingent detached to rejoin the main American fleet in the Pacific while the Eastern Fleet returned to Trincomalee, arriving on 27 May. Two days later, ''Richelieu'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', and six destroyers steamed to [[Colombo]] to rest their crews. While there, ''Richelieu'' was visited by Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]], Supreme Allied Commander of the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|South-East Asia Theatre]]. On 31 May, ''CV'' Merveilleux du Vignaux replaced Marzin as the ship's commander.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=193\u2013194, 199}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=204\u2013205}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=323}}\n\nSomerville planned another raid for mid-June: [[Operation Pedal]], a carrier attack on the harbor of [[Port Blair]] in the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Andaman Islands]]. The purpose of the attack was to again distract the Japanese fleet units in Singapore while American forces embarked on [[Operation Forager]], the invasion of the [[Marianas Islands]]. For the Anglo-French operation, Somerville took only the fast ships, including ''Richelieu'', ''Renown'', and ''Illustrious'' with their accompanying cruiser and destroyer screens. These ships, designated Force 60, sortied on 19 June and two days later, ''Illustrious''{{'}} aircraft struck Japanese targets in the port. The ships arrived back in Trincomalee on 23 June. [[Operation Crimson]] followed in July, and given the lack of a response from the Japanese fleet to the earlier raids, Somerville decided to use his battleships and battlecruiser to bombard Sabang and [[Sumatra]]. ''Richelieu'' and the other ships conducted shooting practice on 7, 14\u201315, and 17 July in preparation for the raid. The plan called for ''Richelieu'', ''Valiant'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', and ''Renown'', supported by cruisers, to shell the port at longer range while the Dutch cruiser {{ship|HNMS|Tromp|1937|2}} led a group of destroyers in a close-range attack. ''Illustrious'', joined by the carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}}, which had recently arrived, provided air cover to the fleet.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=194}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=206\u2013207, 209\u2013214}}{{sfn|Rohwer|pp=334, 344}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu from Saratoga May 1944.jpg|thumb|''Richelieu'' on 18 May 1944 after the conclusion of Operation Transom, taken from USS ''Saratoga'']]\n\nThe Eastern Fleet departed on 22 July and reached the target on the morning of 25 July; the carriers launched their [[combat air patrol]]s and the surface combatants steamed to approach their targets. ''Richelieu'' was the last vessel in the line, astern of ''Renown''. ''Queen Elizabeth'', the leading battleship, opened fire at 06:54 at a range of {{cvt|6000|m}}. The other ships quickly followed suit and [[F4U Corsair]] fighters circled overhead to spot for the ships' guns. ''Richelieu'' fired four-gun salvos, with two guns per turret, and she scored hits with the second salvo, demolishing several buildings and damaging the [[power station]]. Her secondary turrets neutralized a Japanese coastal artillery battery that had been engaging ''Tromp''. At 07:15, the ships ceased firing, and in the brief bombardment, ''Richelieu'' had fired 81&nbsp;main battery shells\u2014this amounted to a [[rate of fire]] of a salvo every 50&nbsp;seconds, nearly twice as fast as the British ships. Japanese aircraft attacked the fleet as it withdrew, but they were kept at bay by the carriers' fighters and heavy anti-aircraft fire from the ships. The fleet arrived back in Trincomalee on 27 July.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\nBy this time, ''Richelieu'' was beginning to suffer from reduced speed, the result of continued boiler trouble and [[biofouling]] of her hull. Admiral [[Laurence E. Power]], who had replaced Somerville as the fleet commander, detached ''Richelieu'' for a refit. The British had initially offered the floating dry-dock ''AFD-28'', but Merveilleux du Vignaux believed that the dry-dock would not be able to accommodate a vessel the size of his ship (he proved to be correct when on 8 August, ''AFD-28'' nearly [[capsize]]d with ''Valiant'' aboard). ''Richelieu'' left on 6 September, bound for Algiers with three escorting destroyers. ''Le Terrible'' and ''Le Fantasque'' took over escort duties after ''Richelieu'' passed through the Suez Canal, and on 23 September the three ships arrived in Algiers. ''Richelieu'' then steamed north to Toulon on 1 October where she was visited again by Lemonnier, but the shipyard there was in ruins, so she moved to Casablanca on 10 October to be refitted. In addition to the hull cleaning and boiler repairs, she had new fire control and search radars installed, including a US SG-1 search radar, British Type-281B air search radar, and Type-285P fire control radars, in addition to other equipment, including an FV1 [[Radio jamming|jammer]] and [[high-frequency direction finding]] gear.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=195}}{{sfn|Lepotier|p=217}}\n\n=====Second deployment with the British Eastern Fleet=====\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A23486.jpg|thumb|Seen from the deck of {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} are ''Valiant'' (center-right) and ''Richelieu'' (right background)]]\n\nOn 23 January 1945, ''Richelieu'' left Casablanca for Gibraltar, arriving there two days later to have her hull cleaned and repainted. The French sought to deploy an independent task force consisting of ''Richelieu'', the four light cruisers still in service, and four destroyers, with a view toward reestablishing French control in [[Indochina]]. But the United States opposed the move and refused to allocate the necessary aircraft carriers and support ships that would have been necessary for another independent fleet, and so ''Richelieu'' could only be sent, alone, back to the Eastern Fleet. The ship conducted trials in February that revealed the problem with her boilers had finally been corrected and she thereafter got underway for Trincomalee, arriving on 20 March. By this time, the modern elements of the Eastern Fleet had been detached to form the [[British Pacific Fleet]], with the Eastern Fleet being renamed the East Indies Fleet. This unit, still under Power's command, consisted of ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Renown'', nine cruisers, ten [[escort carrier]]s, and twenty destroyers. Japanese naval strength at Singapore had also significantly decreased to just four heavy cruisers and several destroyers.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=196}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=195\u2013217}}\n\nFor the next few weeks, ''Richelieu'' was occupied with shooting drills with her primary and secondary batteries and tests for the anti-aircraft radars and command systems. Now assigned to Force 63 of the East Indies Fleet, ''Richelieu'' sortied on 8 April to take part in [[Operation Sunfish]], another bombardment of Sabang while aircraft scouted possible landing beaches near the city of [[Padang]] on the coast of Sumatra. The ships allocated for the operation consisted of ''Richelieu'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', two heavy cruisers, two escort carriers, and five destroyers. Early on 11 April, the two battleships, one of the cruisers, and three destroyers bombarded the island while the other vessels conducted the reconnaissance operation. ''Richelieu'' fired seven salvos with her main battery and used her secondary guns to once again silence the coastal battery on the island. Japanese aircraft launched a poorly-coordinated attack on the battleships but they failed to score any hits. After further carrier operations around Padang, the fleet returned to port on 20 April.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=197}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=408}}\n\nThe next major operation followed a week later. Operation Bishop, a strike against Japanese airfields in the [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]] and [[Andaman Islands]], was to cover British Army landings at [[Rangoon]] in Burma. The plan called for the East Indies Fleet to be divided into multiple groups, each with escorting cruisers and destroyers: four of the escort carriers were to directly support the landings, ''Richelieu'' and ''Queen Elizabeth'' each formed independent surface action groups, and another pair of escort carriers provided air protection for the surface groups. The fleet got underway on 27 April and reached [[Car Nicobar]] two days later. ''Richelieu'' bombarded the airfields at a range of {{cvt|23600|m}}, firing a total of 80&nbsp;main and 45&nbsp;secondary shells. She incurred minor damage to her bow 20&nbsp;mm guns from the blast effects of firing the main battery nearly directly forward. The fleet then proceeded to the Andamans, and at 17:30, ''Richelieu'' opened fire at Port Blair; poor visibility hampered her shooting, and she ceased fire at 18:07, by now having expended the main battery ammunition that had been allotted for the bombardment. She nevertheless returned on 2 May to shell the harbor with her secondary guns, firing 120&nbsp;rounds and inflicting significant damage to the harbor facilities. The fleet steamed north to Rangoon to support the landings, but it was discovered that the Japanese had already withdrawn, allowing the fleet to return to Trincomalee on 8 May.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=198\u2013199}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=412}}\n\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A23483 cropped.jpg|thumb|''Richelieu'' astern of ''Valiant'' during [[Operation Bishop (1945)|Operation Bishop]]]]\n\nA decrypted Japanese radio signal revealed that the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Haguro||2}} and the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Kamikaze|1922|2}} were to steam from Singapore to Port Blair to evacuate the garrison there on the night of 12\u201313 May while another transport vessel would pick up the troops at Car Nicobar. On 9 May, a pair of British submarines spotted ''Haguro'' was it passed through the [[Malacca Strait]], so the East Indies Fleet launched [[Operation Dukedom]] to intercept the Japanese ships. ''Richelieu'' steamed with the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Cumberland|57|6}} as Group 3 of Force 61. Aware that Allied ships were at sea, ''Haguro'' and ''Kamikaze'' turned back, though they were spotted by aircraft from the escort carriers and then sunk by destroyers of the [[26th Destroyer Flotilla]] before ''Richelieu'' and ''Cumberland'' could arrive. Japanese aircraft attacked the fleet as it withdrew back to Trincomalee but were, once again, poorly coordinated and they failed to damage the ships. ''Richelieu'' arrived in port on 18 May.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=199}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=417}}\n\nOn arrival, the ship took on additional ammunition and fuel, and over the coming weeks, she underwent repairs to her boilers and took part in shooting practice. The bombardments carried out earlier in the year had revealed excessive dispersion of the main battery shells, particularly if both guns on one side of the turret were fired at the same time. The crew at that time was unable to determine the cause of the problem, though tests with the remanufactured ''Strasbourg'' charges reduced the problem. On 3 June, the destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Le Triomphant||2}} arrived with spare equipment for ''Richelieu'', which was sent to [[Durban]] for another refit. Her hull again needed to be scraped and her boilers required a re-tubing. The ship had to stop in [[Diego-Suarez|Diego Suarez]] on the way to disembark non-white crewmen at the request of the racist government of [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]; though this caused resentment among the crew, the French nevertheless complied. ''Richelieu'' arrived on 18 July and work lasted from 31 July to 10 August. Thirteen of the ship's 20&nbsp;mm guns were replaced with four 40&nbsp;mm guns, as the lighter weapons had proved to be ineffective against [[kamikaze]]s. The ship conducted training and trials of South Africa before departing for Diego Suarez, ultimately arriving back in Trincomalee on 18 August, by which time [[surrender of Japan|Japan had surrendered]].{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=199\u2013200}}{{sfn|Sarnet & Le Vaillant|pp=325, 329}}\n\n=== Postwar era===\nImmediately after the surrender of Japan, French and British forces began their attempts to reassert control in their Japanese-occupied colonies. On 7 September, ''Richelieu'' got underway in company with the British battleship {{HMS|Nelson|28|2}} to take part in [[Operation Zipper]], the amphibious landing on Sumatra. Two days later, ''Richelieu'' detonated a magnetic mine, though she suffered only minor damage; the force of the blast pushed in some hull plates by {{cvt|10|to|12|cm}} and inflicted minor shock damage to the lighting system, but the vessel remained with the fleet. After landing the troops with no opposition, ''Richelieu'' moved to Singapore on 11 September to participate in [[Operation Tiderace]], the liberation of the city, the following day. She returned to Trincomalee on 16 September before getting underway again on 27 September, bound for Indochina. She steamed with ''Le Triomphant'' as escorts for the transport ships {{SS|Queen Emma||2}} and {{SS|Princess Beatrix||2}}, which carried French soldiers to restore colonial rule in Indochina. French rule was opposed by the [[Viet Minh]], and on arrival ''Richelieu'' was used to support the forces ashore in a variety of capacities: she served as a staging area, hospital, artillery support, and troop transport. She also contributed a landing party to the forces fighting to reassert French control.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=200\u2013201}}{{sfn|Sarnet & Le Vaillant|pp=330\u2013334}}{{sfn|Rohwer|pp=429, 432}}\n\n''Richelieu'', ''Le Triomphant'', and ''Le Fantasque'' took part in [[Operation Mapor]] at [[Nha Trang]] from 20 to 26 November, providing heavy fire support to soldiers fighting in the area. By this time, a French squadron consisting of the aircraft carrier {{ship|French aircraft carrier|B\u00e9arn||2}} and the cruisers {{ship|French cruiser|Gloire|1935|2}}, {{ship|French cruiser|Suffren||2}}, and {{ship|French cruiser|\u00c9mile Bertin||2}} had arrived in mid-October, allowing ''Richelieu'' to be returned to France. Before leaving, ''Richelieu'' sent her four single 40&nbsp;mm guns and most of her 20&nbsp;mm guns ashore, along with a considerable stockpile of ammunition for the guns and 152&nbsp;mm shells. She departed on 29 December and arrived in Toulon on 11 February 1946, thereafter taking part in the transport effort to send French soldiers back from France to North Africa. With that completed, she steamed north to [[Cherbourg]], arriving to be dry-docked on 16 March. Repairs lasted until 20 July, and consisted of replacing the starboard propeller, correcting the hull damage from the mine in September 1945, and thoroughly overhauling her boilers.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=200\u2013201}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=432}}\n\nWith the repairs completed, ''Richelieu'' sailed to Britain to carry the crew for the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Colossus|R15|6}}, which was to be loaned to the French for five years, serving as ''Arromanches''. ''Richelieu'' thereafter began a training cruise that included stops in Casablanca, Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, and Dakar. Later that year, she visited Portugal in company with ''Arromanches''. She returned to Brest for modifications to the secondary battery from February to March 1947. The ship thereafter formed the core of a battle group that included three ex-German destroyers, based in Cherbourg. The group, along with a carrier group centered on ''Arromanches'' and cruiser group, both based in Toulon, were combined to form the ''Force d'Intervention'', with ''Richelieu'' as the flagship of ''[[Vice Amiral]]'' (Vice Admiral) [[Robert Jaujard]]. The unit embarked on a training cruise to Africa in May and June, beginning with the three groups assembling in Casablanca on 8 May. ''Richelieu'' arrived back in Cherbourg on 13 June and began a period of maintenance and training of new crew members. Another training cruise to North Africa followed late in 1947, and while there she conducted shooting practice to try to determine the cause of the excessive shell dispersion. The subsequent installation of 60-millisecond delays to the firing circuits of the outer guns in the turrets created enough space between the shells that they did not disrupt each other in flight, significantly improving the issue.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=201\u2013204}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=285\u2013289}}{{sfn|Dumas|pp=43, 74}}\n\nThe ''Force d'Intervention'' was reactivated for another cruise in early 1948; the three constituent groups rendezvoused at Toulon and then conducted training exercises off North Africa. While in Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, the ship was slightly damaged while being moored in the port. Following the conclusion of the maneuvers, the force was disbanded and ''Richelieu'' steamed north to Brest, arriving on 29 May. The ship was in need of a thorough refit, and she was dry-docked in Cherbourg from August to September to survey the work that would be needed to be done. Jaujard left the ship and her crew was reduced to 750&nbsp;men. Since the French naval budget was in a very limited state owing to the wrecked French economy in the immediate postwar years, ''Richelieu''{{'}}s refit was postponed to allow the funds to be used to complete ''Jean Bart'' instead. ''Richelieu'' was accordingly placed in reserve on 1 April 1949. The refit eventually began on 1 January 1950 and lasted until 24 October 1951, and it included a thorough overhaul of her propulsion machinery, replacement of her worn main and secondary battery guns, and repairs to her anti-aircraft battery, along with other modifications.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n[[File:Canon Richelieu Brest.jpg|thumb|One of the two remaining 380 mm guns of ''Richelieu'', by the Penfeld river in [[Brest, France|Brest]]]]\n\nDuring the refit, it was decided that the ship's anti-aircraft battery was too dated to allow the ship to operate in the era of jet aircraft; coupled with the need to update the ship's radar and electronics and install more capable command spaces, the costs would have been prohibitively high for the French Navy. Instead of fully modernizing the vessel, the navy decided to employ ''Richelieu'' as a [[training ship]] in the gunnery school in February 1951. After completing the refit, the ship underwent trials in November that involved firing nine rounds per gun from the main battery; this would be the last time ''Richelieu'' fired the 380&nbsp;mm guns. Beginning in May 1952, the ship was based in Toulon as the flagship of ''CA'' Champion, and she spent the next few years conducting shooting practice with the secondary and smaller weapons to train the fleet's gunners. Another refit followed from October 1953 to February 1954. This involved replacing the British gunnery radar with a French-built set.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=205\u2013206}}\n\nFor the first and last time of either of their careers, ''Richelieu'' and ''Jean Bart'' cruised together on 30 January 1956. The ship's career as a sea-going gunnery ship ended in February, when she was [[:wikt:laid up|laid up]] in Brest. To prepare ''Richelieu'' for [[reserve fleet|reserve]], dehumidifiers were installed in the secondary turrets to inhibit rust and the 100&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm quad mounts were covered. The single 40&nbsp;mm guns and all of the 20&nbsp;mm guns still aboard the vessel were removed. She was thereafter used as a stationary school ship for reserve officers and as a [[barracks ship|floating barracks]] until 30 September 1967, when she was struck from the [[naval register]]. Renamed ''Q432'', she was condemned on 16 January 1968 and sold to the Genoa-based [[ship breaker]] Cantieri Navali Santa Maria in September. Before departing Brest, her 380&nbsp;mm guns were removed and two were later preserved, one in Brest and the other in Ruelle. ''Richelieu'' was then towed to [[La Spezia]], where she was broken up for [[scrap]] over the course of the following year.{{sfn|Jordan &

Built as a response to the Italian {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship|4}}, the ''Richelieu''s were based on their immediate predecessors of the {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|4}} with the same unconventional arrangement that grouped their [[main battery]] forward in two quadruple [[gun turret]]s. They were scaled up to accommodate a much more powerful [[main battery]] of eight [[380 mm/45 Mod\u00e8le 1935 gun|{{cvt|380|mm}} guns]] (compared to the {{cvt|330|mm}} guns of the ''Dunkerque''s), with increased armor to protect them from guns of the same caliber. ''Richelieu'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] in 1935 and was [[ship launching|launched]] in 1939, just before the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe. As war with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] became increasingly likely, work on the ship was rushed to prepare her for [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] in April 1940.\n\nCompleted just days before the Germans won the [[Battle of France]] in June, ''Richelieu'' fled to [[Dakar]] in [[French West Africa]] to keep her under French control. There, she came under repeated British attacks that had been intended to either compel the battleship to join the [[Free French Naval Forces]] or sink her; these included during [[Operation Catapult]] in July 1940 and the [[Battle of Dakar]] in September. Damaged in both attacks, the ship was slowly repaired before eventually being turned over to Free French control after the [[Operation Torch|Allied invasion of North Africa]] in November 1942. After being sent to the United States for repairs and an extensive modernization, the ship served with the British [[Home Fleet]] in early 1944 before being deployed to the [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Eastern Fleet]] for operations against the Japanese in the [[Indian Ocean]]. These included several bombardment operations and in May 1945 she was present during the [[Battle of the Malacca Strait]], though she was too far away to engage the Japanese ships before they were sunk.\n\n''Richelieu'' was part of the force that liberated [[Singapore]] following the [[Japanese surrender]] in September, and she thereafter operated in [[French Indochina]] as part of the initial effort to restore French colonial rule. Recalled to France in December 1945, she was repaired and modernized slightly in 1946. The ship saw relatively limited peacetime training in the immediate postwar years and in 1952, she was removed from active service for use as a gunnery [[training ship]]. In 1956, she was placed in [[reserve fleet|reserve]] and was thereafter used as a stationary training vessel and [[barracks ship]] until 1967, when the French Navy decided to discard her. Sold for [[scrap]] in 1968, she was [[ship breaking|broken up]] in Italy from 1968 to 1969.\n\n== Design==\n{{main|Richelieu-class battleship}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu-1.jpg|left|thumb|Recognition drawing of ''Richelieu'' in her original configuration]]\n\nWhen in 1934 [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] announced that it would begin building two {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship|1}}s armed with {{cvt|380|mm}} guns, the [[French Navy]] immediately began preparations to counter them. The small {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|1}}s that had been ordered provided the template for the next French battleship design, but it needed to be scaled up to match the new Italian vessels, both in terms of offensive and defensive characteristics. The design staff considered 380 and {{cvt|406|mm|0}} guns, but the latter could not be incorporated in a design that remained within the {{cvt|35000|LT|MT|-1|lk=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and was quickly discarded. The ''Dunkerque''s carried their armament in two quadruple [[gun turret]]s arrayed in a [[superfire|superfiring pair]] forward of the [[superstructure]], and the designers experimented with other arrangements, including combinations of triple and twin turrets, but the need to minimize the length of the armor belt (and thus its weight) necessitated the ''Dunkerque'' layout.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=94\u201397}}\n\n''Richelieu'' displaced {{convert|37250|LT|MT|abbr=on}} [[Standard displacement|standard]] and {{convert|44698|MT|LT|order=flip}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|247.85|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33.08|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. She was powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbines]] and six oil-fired Sural [[water-tube boiler]]s, which developed a total of {{convert|155000|shp|lk=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|32|kn|lk=in}}. At a cruising speed of {{convert|15|kn}}, the ship could steam for {{convert|9500|nmi|lk=in}}. Her crew numbered 1,569&nbsp;officers and men. The ship carried four [[Loire 130]] [[seaplane]]s on the [[quarterdeck]], and the aircraft facilities consisted of a steam [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] and a crane to handle the floatplanes.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=260}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=99\u2013101}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[380 mm/45 Mod\u00e8le 1935 gun|380 mm/45 Mod\u00e8le (Mle) 1935 guns]] arranged in two quadruple gun turrets,{{efn|/45 refers to the length of the gun in terms of [[caliber (artillery)|calibers]]; a /45 gun is 45 times long as it is in bore diameter.}} both of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward of the superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of nine [[Canon de 152 mm Mod\u00e8le 1930|{{convert|152|mm|abbr=on|0}} /55 Mle 1930 guns]] mounted in three triple turrets, arranged on the rear superstructure. Heavy [[anti-aircraft]] (AA) defense consisted of twelve {{cvt|100|mm}} /45 Mle 1930 anti-aircraft guns in twin turrets. Close range anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of eight [[Canon de 37 mm Mod\u00e8le 1925|{{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] guns in twin mounts and twenty [[Hotchkiss M1929 machine gun|{{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] machine guns in four quadruple and two twin mounts. The ship's [[belt armor]] was {{convert|330|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships, and the main battery turrets were protected by {{convert|430|mm|abbr=on}} of armor plate on the faces. The main armored deck was {{convert|170|mm|abbr=on}} thick, and the [[conning tower]] had {{convert|340|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=260}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=99}}\n\n== Service ==\n\n===Construction===\nThe contract for ''Richelieu'' was awarded to the [[Arsenal de Brest]] on 31 August 1935, and the [[keel]] for the new ship was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 22 October in the No. 4 dock that had recently built {{ship|French battleship|Dunkerque||2}}. The [[slipway]] was not long enough to accommodate the entire length of the new battleship, and so the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] had to be built in pieces. The main section of the hull, which amounted to {{cvt|197|m}}, was built on the slipway, while a {{cvt|43|m}} length of the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and an {{cvt|8|m}} length of her [[stern]] were built elsewhere and attached after the rest of the ship was [[ship launching|launched]] on 17 January 1939. The French decision to lay down ''Richelieu'' in 1935 put the country in violation of the Washington Treaty, which was to expire on 31 December 1936, as the combined tonnage of the two ''Dunkerque''s and ''Richelieu'' exceeded the {{cvt|70000|LT|MT}} that had been allotted to France during the moratorium on new battleship construction. France used the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]], which Britain had unilaterally signed with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in June 1935 to dismiss British objections to the new ship, though they nevertheless slowed construction of ''Richelieu'' to ease British concerns. Work was also slowed by [[Strike action|strikes]] in the shipyards for better pay and working conditions.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=260}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=98, 122}}\n\nBy the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, the hull had been assembled; the start of the war led the naval command to decide to slow work on other, less complete vessels to focus efforts on ''Richelieu'' and her [[sister ship]] {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1940|2}}. The ship began initial testing on 15 October while still [[fitting-out]] in an effort to rush the ship into service; the same day, the ship's first commander, [[Ship-of-the-line captain|''Capitaine de vaisseau'']] (''CV''\u2014Ship-of-the-line captain) Marzin came aboard. Engine testing began on 14 January 1940, and a week later her main battery was completed when the last barrel was installed. Further engine testing was carried out between 31 March and 7 April; during this period, she was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 1 April. Formal [[sea trial|acceptance trials]] began on 14 April. Repair work was conducted in [[Brest, France|Brest]] from 19 to 27 May, and fire control equipment for the main and secondary batteries were installed. ''Richelieu'' conducted full power trials on 13 June, reaching {{convert|32.63|kn}} from {{cvt|179000|shp}}, exceeding her design performance. Test firings of the guns were conducted on 13 and 14 June. Work on the ship was completed on 15 June 1940, days before France surrendered to Germany after the [[Battle of France]].{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\n===World War II===\n====Under Vichy control: 1940\u20131942====\nWith German troops advancing across France by mid-June, the Navy decided to evacuate ''Richelieu'' to [[Dakar]] in [[French West Africa]]; while earlier plans had been to send the fleet to British ports to continue the war, when the possibility of a negotiated armistice arose, the government decided that the fleet would be a useful bargaining chip. As a result, vessels should be preserved under French control, away from German occupation. At 06:45, the ship took on a load of ammunition and fuel, though she received only 198&nbsp;quarter charges of propellant for her main battery, which amounted to powder sufficient for 49&nbsp;shots. Material that had not yet been installed was also hastily loaded onto the ship, to be fitted once ''Richelieu'' reached the safety of Dakar. She also took aboard gold reserves from the [[Bank of France]] and 250&nbsp;cadets from the ''[[\u00c9cole Navale]]'' (Naval Academy). There was insufficient time to allow the full complement to assemble and board the ship, and at 04:00 the next morning, ''Richelieu'' got underway while German troops approached Brest. ''Richelieu'' steamed in company with the [[destroyer]]s {{ship|French destroyer|Fougueux||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Frondeur||2}} while German aircraft made several ineffective attacks against the ships. The battleship's anti-aircraft guns returned fire without success. Initially cruising at a speed of {{cvt|22|kn}}, boiler trouble forced the ships to decrease speed to {{cvt|18|kn}}. The motors for her [[rudder]] also repeatedly broke down on the voyage, though the crew was able to repair them. While cruising off [[Casablanca]], [[French Morocco]] at 17:00 on 20 June, the torpedo boats were detached to refuel, their place being taken by the new destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Fleuret|1938|2}}. The two vessels then proceeded on to Dakar, where they arrived at 17:44 on 23 June.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=124\u2013125}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=29}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' in Dakar in 1940]]\n\nOn arriving in Dakar, an uneasy situation confronted ''Richelieu'' while armistice negotiations were still underway. The commander of French naval forces in the region, ''[[Contre-amiral]]'' (''CA''\u2014Rear Admiral) Plan\u00e7on and the [[governor-general]] of French West Africa, [[:fr:L\u00e9on Cayla|L\u00e9on Cayla]], were inclined to remain in the war against Germany. Also, significant British naval units were in the area, including the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} moored in Dakar and the British South Atlantic Squadron, which was nearby. At the same time, ''Richelieu'' had used half of her fuel to escape Brest, and she could perform little sustained firing of her main or secondary guns. Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]], the [[Chief of Staff of the French Navy]], sent a telegraph on the night of 23\u201324 June to warn Marzin that the British might attack the vessel to neutralize it in the event of a French surrender, and ordered him to begin preparations to [[scuttling|scuttle]] the ship if the need arose. Meanwhile, on 23 June, the British heavy cruiser {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|2}} departed [[Freetown]] to observe ''Richelieu''{{'}}s activities in Dakar.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=29}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=125}}\n\nOn 25 June, Marzin received word that the French government had signed the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|Armistice with Germany]]. Darlan instructed him that the ship was to remain under French control, and if that proved to be impossible, he was to scuttle the ship or attempt to escape to the then-neutral United States. Marzin decided that, given the threat of British warships in the area, the best course of action was to try to escape to Casablanca and join the French fleet there, and so at 14:30 ''Richelieu'' got underway in company with ''Fleuret''. ''Hermes'' raised anchor as well and began to follow ''Richelieu'' with her [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s on her [[flight deck]], but the coastal artillery trained their guns on the ship, convincing ''Hermes''{{'}} commander to return to port. ''Dorsetshire'' nevertheless shadowed ''Richelieu'' while she was at sea. The next morning, Darlan, who feared that Marzin was trying to defect to the [[Free French forces]], ordered him to return to Dakar. Marzin complied and turned the ships back to port, but while on the way, he received amended orders instructing him to wait some {{cvt|120|nmi}} north of [[Cape Verde]] to escort the 1st Division of Armed Merchant Cruisers to Dakar, as they were carrying another load of gold reserves from the Bank of France. ''Richelieu'' failed to make contact at the prescribed rendezvous point, and since she had not embarked any of her floatplanes before fleeing Brest, she could not conduct an aerial search. Marzin instead returned to Dakar on 28 June; the convoy arrived, having been significantly delayed, on 4 July.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=29}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nAfter returning to port, work began to prepare the ship for action as quickly as possible. Marzin ordered that a stockpile of 330&nbsp;mm propellant charges that had been stocked for the battleship {{ship|French battleship|Strasbourg||2}} before France's surrender to be converted into charges that were usable by ''Richelieu''. The secondary guns were readied for action ten days later, but they lacked a director capable of tracking aerial targets, so they could be used against surface ships only. Under the terms of the armistice, ''Richelieu'' was to be returned to Toulon, where she would be demobilized, though the Germans later decided against permitting the move, as they feared the British would try to seize the ship during the passage through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]; the British, meanwhile, were under the mistaken impression that the Germans sought to seize the French fleet for their own use. This led to [[Operation Catapult]], a series of attacks on French warships to neutralize vessels that would not defect to the Free French.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=72, 126}}\n\n=====British attack on 8 July 1940 and repairs=====\n\n[[File:HMS Hermes June 1940.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Hermes'' (center) and ''Dorsetshire'' (background) off Dakar during the operation against ''Richelieu'']]\n\nThe component of Catapult that targeted ''Richelieu'' consisted of the carrier ''Hermes'', which joined the cruisers {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}} and ''Dorsetshire'' off Dakar. On 4 July, the day after the British had [[attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|attacked Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]], Plan\u00e7on ordered the [[submarine]]s {{ship|French submarine|Le Glorieux||2}} and {{ship|French submarine|Le H\u00e9ros||2}} to attack ''Dorsetshire'' while it cruised off the port. He also instructed the coastal batteries to open fire if she closed to within {{cvt|15|km}}, though ''Dorsetshire'' remained at a distance. Marzin moved ''Richelieu'' to a position near the island of [[Gor\u00e9e]], pointed south so that the ship's main battery could aim at any vessels that approached Dakar. The British had intended to send [[Force H]] to Dakar after the attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, but the need to return to destroy ''Dunkerque'' forced the British to resort to ''Hermes''; on 7 July, the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Milford|L51|6}} was sent to contact Plan\u00e7on and issue the ultimatum to either surrender his ship to British control or be sunk.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=126}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=32}}\n\nMarzin prepared his ship to sortie the next morning; he intended to use the eight rounds loaded in his main guns to attack ''Hermes''. Other forces in Dakar were put on alert and ''Le H\u00e9ros'' again sortied to assist in the attack. While the French preparations were ongoing, the British sent a motorboat from ''Milford'' to drop four [[depth charge]]s under ''Richelieu''{{'}}s stern to disable her screws, though this attempt failed. At 04:15, a group of Swordfish launched from ''Hermes'' as ''Richelieu'' was about to get underway. One of their torpedoes struck the ship aft on the [[starboard]] side and tore a hole that was {{cvt|9.3|by|8.5|m}} between the propeller shafts. The resulting shock disabled many of the ship's systems. Two of her fire control directors were knocked off their tracks, the starboard propeller shafts were bent, and the blast caused significant flooding. Damage control teams pumped fuel out of the bunkers to counteract the loss of buoyancy aft and the ship was towed into port for repairs. [[Anti-torpedo net]]s were set up around the vessel, which had taken on some {{cvt|2400|t|LT}} of water and at low tide rested on the harbor bottom.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=32}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=127}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nLater that afternoon, [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]] came alongside and began pumping oil out of the ship's bunkers to reduce her draft, but water continued to leak into the hull through the cable tunnels. Pumps attached to the ship helped to control the flooding, but the hoses repeatedly pulled loose as ''Richelieu'' rose and fell with the waves. To further complicate the effort to repair the ship, Dakar lacked a dry dock sufficient to accommodate ''Richelieu''; the battleship could not simply be drained and plated over. Instead, damaged [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] had to be patched and pumped out individually; by 28 August, some {{cvt|1300|t|LT}} of water remained aboard the ship. Heavy use of the pumps caused frequent breakdowns, which further slowed work. In his report on the attack and subsequent repairs, Marin criticized faulty design and construction practices that hindered damage control efforts, including insufficient pumping equipment, poor quality control for the welding of bulkheads, and a failure to ensure that critical components like the turret trunks were watertight.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=128, 137}}\n\nWhile work to control and reverse the flooding was ongoing, other repairs were necessary to return the ship to operational status. The fire-control directors needed to be re-seated in their tracks, wiring that had been damaged by flooding or leaking fuel oil had to be replaced, and several of the electrical generators, which had been badly shaken by the blast, needed to be rebuilt. Given the limited ability to repair the damage to the ship, Marzin focused efforts on ensuring that the main and secondary batteries could be effectively used, even if the ship could only be employed as a static [[floating battery]] against an expected second attack from British forces. ''[[Amiral]]'' (Admiral) [[Jean de Laborde]] flew to Dakar to conduct an inspection and help to organize the defenses. As part of these preparations, both Plan\u00e7on and Cayla, who were suspected of being pro-British, were removed from their posts, with Plan\u00e7on's place taken by ''CA'' Platon and then ''CA'' Landriau.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nWorkers in the local shipyard scavenged metal from other ships in the harbor to fabricate an {{cvt|11.5|m}} square patch to cover the torpedo hole, which was planned to be installed by 10 September. This would allow the rear [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]] for the 152&nbsp;mm and 37&nbsp;mm guns to be drained. At the same time, the shipyard began building a steel [[cofferdam]] around the ship that was to have been completed by late October, which would allow the rest of the hull to be pumped dry. With the hull pumped out, permanent repairs were to have been completed by January 1941. While this work was being carried out, the crew cleaned and painted the ship and continued to work on readying the armament. A total of 150 complete charges for the main battery were created by remanufacturing the stockpile intended for ''Strasbourg''. Parts of the crew were dispersed for other tasks: 106 were sent to man the armed merchant cruisers in the harbor, whose reservist crews had to be demobilized, and the 64-man crew of the forward gun turret were sent to man the coastal battery at [[Cap Manuel]]. After another 132&nbsp;reservists from ''Richelieu'' were demobilized, a total of 1,039&nbsp;officers and men were left aboard the ship. The 100-, 37-, and 13.2&nbsp;mm guns were kept manned continuously given the threat of further British air attacks.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\n=====Battle of Dakar=====\n[[File:HMS Barham FL1472.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Barham|04|6}}, ''Richelieu''{{'}}s primary opponent during the battle]]\n{{main|Battle of Dakar}}\n\nWhile repairs were being carried out in August, the British began preparations for another attack, code-named Operation Menace. British [[Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] sought to use a contingent of Free French forces led by [[Charles de Gaulle]] to invade the colony and seize the ship for use against Germany. By late August, a [[convoy]] had been assembled with five ships carrying weapons and supplies got underway, later rendezvousing with a second convoy of six [[troop ship]]s carrying some 2,400&nbsp;Free French soldiers and 4,270&nbsp;British soldiers. The naval support force consisted of the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} and the battleships {{HMS|Barham|04|2}} and {{HMS|Resolution|09|2}}, along with four cruisers and numerous other warships. The plan called for de Gaulle to use his French forces to attempt to secure the colony, only calling on British support if the Vichy forces resisted him. At the same time, several French colonies in Africa defected to Free France, prompting the Vichy government to secure authorization from the [[German Armistice Commission]] to send several [[light cruiser]]s and destroyers to reinforce their holdings in Africa, designated Force Y. Owing to the risk of encountering British vessels on the passage, the destroyers were temporarily left in Casablanca while the three cruisers, carrying supplies and additional men to crew the coastal batteries, raced south at high speed. They reached Dakar on 14 September, and after disembarking the men and supplies, continued on south to [[French Equatorial Africa]] (in what is now present-day Gabon).{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=139\u2013141}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}\n\nThe British believed that the arrival of Force Y indicated that the French were aware of Operation Menace, but de Gaulle decided to proceed with the attack regardless. While Force Y steamed south, two of the three cruisers were intercepted by British cruisers and forced to fall back to Dakar, arriving there again on 20 September, by which time the destroyers had arrived. On 22 September, the liner {{SS|Banfora}} was due to arrive with a load of 380&nbsp;mm shells, and as a result, French search aircraft were arrayed to the north to cover the liner's approach; they were completely surprised by the arrival of the Anglo-Free French force on the morning of 23 September. A small party of Free French troops sent to rally the port to de Gaulle was repulsed with machine-gun fire and ''Richelieu''{{'}}s 100&nbsp;mm guns fired warning shots toward the Free French [[aviso]] {{ship|French aviso|Savorgnan de Brazza||2}} shortly after 07:00. On the approach of the sloops {{ship|French sloop|Commandant Domin\u00e9||2}} and {{ship|French sloop|Commandant Duboc||2}} at 08:10, ''Richelieu'' again fired warning shots from her 100&nbsp;mm guns. The British warships approached the port and came under fire from the coastal batteries, leading the Anglo-Free French commanders, de Gaulle and Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]] to conclude that they would have to directly attack the port if the operation was to succeed.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=141}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=109\u2013114}}\n\n''Barham'' and ''Resolution'' opened fire on ''Richelieu'' at 11:05, but poor visibility hampered the British shooting and they checked fire after twenty minutes, having inflicted only splinter damage to the cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Montcalm|1935|2}} and the destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Le Malin||2}}. The French coastal batteries hit several of the cruisers and destroyers, but ''Richelieu'' was moored facing north, which prevented her from taking part in the initial duel. Following the British withdrawal, Marzin used [[tugboat]]s to turn the ship far enough to enable her to bring her main battery to bear. The defenses of Dakar now alerted, the Free French then attempted to land further east at [[Rufisque]], but the landing there was repulsed as well. The British and Free French withdrew to regroup for another attack the next day. Between 06:25 and 08:00 on 24 September, the British launched three strikes with Swordfish and [[Blackburn Skua]] bombers. These attacks scored no hits on ''Richelieu'' owing to poor visibility, though they made several near-misses that inflicted no damage. In return, ''Richelieu''{{'}}s gunners claimed three of the six aircraft that were shot down, and damaged another. An hour and a half later, the British battleships and two [[heavy cruiser]]s approached and took ''Richelieu'' under fire with their 380&nbsp;mm main batteries.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=141\u2013142}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=137\u2013139}}\n\n''Richelieu'' returned fire at 09:40, but her No. 7 gun was destroyed by a shell that detonated in the barrel and the No. 8 gun was also badly damaged. This was first traced to the use of the remanufactured propellant from ''Strasbourg'', but during a later inquiry in 1941, it was determined that the explosions were caused by a flaw in the design of the shell base.{{sfn|Dumas|pp=77\u201378}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=143, 149}} Guns Nos. 5 and 6 remained in action but they failed to score any hits. At 09:57, one of ''Richelieu''{{'}}s secondary guns hit ''Barham'', though the British ships inflicted little damage in return, apart from minor splinter damage before breaking off at 10:07. During this period, the French counted some 160 shells that hit near the ship, but they did little damage. The French then laid smoke screens to obscure ''Richelieu'' before the British returned to the action at 12:53, initially targeting a destroyer before bombarding the port for the next half an hour. ''Richelieu'' was not struck in the barrage, during which at 12:56, she used guns 5 and 6 to engage the British cruisers, quickly straddling one of them and convincing them to disengage. She fired four 380&nbsp;mm shells at ''Barham'' at 13:11\u201313:12 but failed to hit with any, though both British battleships had been hit several times by the coastal batteries. After disengaging for the day, de Gaulle decided to abandon the operation, but Cunningham convinced him to allow a final attempt the next morning. In the meantime, Marzin decided to transfer the crews from turret 2 to turret 1, which also required moving the shells and propellant between magazines.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=143\u2013145}}{{sfn|Williams|p=140}}\n\nAs the British approached on the morning of 25 September, Marzin decided to engage ''Barham'' with his main battery and ''Resolution'' with his 152&nbsp;mm guns. While the British were approaching their bombardment positions, ''Richelieu'' shot down one of the reconnaissance planes shortly before 07:00. She opened fire at 09:04 with her main battery, firing two shots that fell short, and the coastal guns and Force Y cruisers followed suit shortly thereafter. While the British battleships were turning to unmask their rear guns, the submarine {{ship|French submarine|B\u00e9v\u00e9ziers|1935|2}} torpedoed and badly damaged ''Resolution''. ''Barham'' avoided the torpedoes and opened fire, quickly straddling ''Richelieu'' and at 09:15, she scored a hit [[amidships]] that penetrated above the side armor, though it caused no casualties. In return, ''Richelieu'' hit ''Barham'' in the bow, but it did little damage. At 09:25, the British disengaged to cover ''Resolution''{{'}}s withdrawal. After the British were gone, the gun crew attempted to clear the shells that had been loaded in guns 5 and 6 and the shell in No. 5 also exploded, leaving No. 6 the only operable gun in the turret. In total, French warships in the harbor lost 100&nbsp;dead and 182&nbsp;wounded, while another 84 were killed and 197 wounded among the civilian population.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=147}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=152\u2013154}}\n\nBeginning on 29 September, the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}} and escorting destroyers were detached from Force H to patrol off Dakar, as the British believed ''Richelieu'' would be transferred to [[metropolitan France]] for repairs. The British ships remained in the area until 1 October when it became clear that the ship would not be moved.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=43}}\n\n=====Repairs and defection to Free France=====\n[[File:Richelieu-3.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' at Dakar in 1941]]\n\nRepair work resumed immediately. The hit from ''Barham'' did little serious damage to the ship, but it nevertheless caused extensive deformation of interior bulkheads, the armor deck was forced down where the shell hit it, and the uptakes from the boilers were damaged. Wiring in the area was also cut by fragments and needed to be replaced. On 10 October, the workers attempted to attach the patch that had been manufactured, but it did not work; it did not create a watertight seal, which meant the compartments could not be pumped out. The patch was abandoned in the hopes that the cofferdam, then nearing completion, would work. The cofferdam was modeled to conform to the hull and was built with an interior void that could be used as a [[ballast tank]] so it could be floated in position and sunk in place. The cofferdam was ready by late December, which allowed the hull to be pumped dry and then sealed with welded plates and cement; the hull was finally sealed by 28 February 1941. Further repairs were hampered by the German Armistice Commission, which attempted to slow progress to prevent the ship from returning to full operational status. They blocked the shipment of new guns or a new propeller shaft, and severely constrained the transfer of other equipment. During this period, on 27 February, ''CV'' Deramond replaced Marzin as the ship's commander.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=125, 147\u2013149}}\n\nAs repairs were carried out, the ship saw little activity through late 1942 apart from engaging unidentified aircraft on 28 July and 29 September 1941 and 26 February and 12 May 1942.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=150}} During this period, in April 1941, the ship received the first [[radar]] set installed on a French battleship. And in July, her Loire seaplanes finally arrived; tests with the catapults were conducted in October.{{sfn|Dumas|pp=34, 50}} On 10 April 1942, the ship conducted a test firing with gun No. 6 to demonstrate that the shell design problem had been corrected; all six shells were fired without incident. On 8 November, American and British forces landed in French North Africa (code-named [[Operation Torch]]), which prompted the Germans to invade the rest of Vichy France, which in turn led Darlan to defect to the Allies with the rest of the fleet.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=150}}\n\nThe [[United States Navy]] sent a group to evaluate the ships under Darlan's control to determine which should be modernized in the United States. The only French battleship still in service, ''Richelieu'' was an obvious candidate. The US Navy had not initially been interested in repairing ''Richelieu''; while the Germans and Italians retained a number of powerful battleships, the United States had recently commissioned or would soon complete eight fast battleships, more than sufficient to cover US requirements for the [[Pacific War]] and to send to Europe to reinforce the [[Royal Navy]]. In addition, repairing and modernizing a ship the size of ''Richelieu'' would require significant resources that could be used for other purposes. But pressure from Britain and the Free French convinced the Navy to agree to the project. For France, she was the only surviving modern battleship and thus a major symbol of national prestige, while the British had long sought to acquire the vessel to stiffen the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], which at that time had just two new battleships to oppose their three Italian counterparts.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=150, 181}}\n\n[[File:French battleship Richelieu in New York.jpg|thumb|''Richelieu'' in the United States for repairs]]\n\nShe ran sea trials from 25 to 29 January 1943 to evaluate the state of her engines, which had not been used since July 1940. Her aircraft facilities and anti-aircraft armament were removed during the evaluation period, as they would be replaced by US equipment. On 30 January, she departed Dakar with ''Montcalm'', bound for New York City, where both vessels would be modernized. ''Richelieu'' steamed at a speed of {{cvt|14|kn}} and her rudder had to be held to seven degrees to account for the hull deformation. The ships arrived on 11 February and on the 18th, ''Richelieu'' was taken into Dock No. 5 at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] to begin the modernization.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=150}}{{sfn|Dumas|pp=37, 50}}\n\n====Free-French career: 1943\u20131945====\n=====Refit in New York City=====\nPolitical tensions between the United States and France played a major role in determining how much ''Richelieu'' would be modernized. The US Navy refused to transfer the latest radar equipment on the basis that it was too sensitive to be released. As a result, much of the improvement was limited to the installation of a new anti-aircraft battery of the latest US weapons and auxiliary equipment in addition to a thorough overhaul and permanent repairs to the torpedo damage. Three shifts of workers, totaling some 2,000&nbsp;men, worked on the ship twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, for five months to rush the ship back into service. The modifications to the ship increased her displacement by about {{cvt|3000|t|LT}}. While the ship was being modernized, ''CV'' Lambert replaced Deramont as the ship's commander on 29 April.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=125, 181\u2013182, 186}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu Ney York.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' arrives in New York with her damaged turret. The uppermost fire control director on the fore tower had to be dismantled for her to pass under the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to the [[New York Navy Yard]]]]\n\nThe ship's armament required extensive repairs and modifications to bring ''Richelieu'' up to modern standards. First, three of the eight main battery guns had to be replaced, which required removing the turret roof. Since the gun cradles were undamaged, the guns were simply replaced by barrels taken from ''Jean Bart'', which had been recovered at Casablanca during Operation Torch. The shell handling equipment of both the primary and secondary guns was thoroughly overhauled, with wiring being replaced and the shell and propellant lifts being rebuilt\u2014the latter had never been made to function correctly while the ship was in Dakar. Ammunition for the primary and secondary guns was now a problem, as the source, factories in France, was occupied by German forces. Drawings of the plans for the 380&nbsp;mm shells were prepared in Dakar and forwarded to the United States, where a contract to produce 930&nbsp;shells was ordered from [[Crucible Industries|Crucible Steel]]. American 6-inch/47 Mk&nbsp;16 shells were used as a starting point to supply the 152&nbsp;mm guns, as they were the same caliber and required relatively minor modifications for use in the French weapons.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nHer 100&nbsp;mm guns were retained, but her light anti-aircraft battery now consisted of fifty-six [[Bofors 40 mm gun|{{cvt|40|mm}} Bofors guns]] in quadruple mounts, all placed with their own Mk&nbsp;51 gun director. These were arranged with two abreast the superfiring turret, two on either side of the forward tower, another two per side of the aft tower, and the remaining four on the [[quarterdeck]], where the aircraft catapults had been. These guns were supplemented with fifty [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{cvt|20|mm}} Oerlikon cannons]], all in individual or twin mounts. Nine were placed on the [[forecastle]] aft of the [[Breakwater (ship)|breakwater]], four were mounted on the superfiring turret, nine were placed on the former aircraft hangar, with the rest dispersed around the superstructure, including on the towers and the shelter deck.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186\u2013188}}\n\n''Richelieu''{{'}}s tower foremast was heavily reconfigured; the upper main battery director (which had never been operational) had been removed to allow the ship to clear the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], was left off. In its place, the [[radome]] for the SF surface search radar was installed, along with the mattress antenna for the SA-2 [[air search radar]]; these were short-range sets that had been designed for small craft, the SA-2 intended for [[PT boat]]s. Most of the command spaces in the tower were converted for other uses. The fire control systems for the main battery had to be replaced and those for the secondary guns were repaired with new wiring and telephones. The ship's original [[Hermann Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe|Ansch\u00fctz]] [[gyrocompass]]es were replaced with [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] models. The ship's propulsion system was thoroughly overhauled: the turbines were thoroughly repaired and the boilers were re-tubed. Much of the wiring throughout the ship was replaced, and a [[degaussing]] cable was installed.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186, 188\u2013189}}\n\nTo repair the hull, the concrete was broken up and removed, the sections that had been most badly damaged by the torpedo were stripped of all fittings, and deformed bulkheads and plating were cut out. After more than two and a half years without being dry-docked in a tropical port, the hull needed maintenance beyond simply repairing the torpedo damage, though given the conditions to which it had been subjected, it was in fairly good condition. It was sandblasted and those sections of plating that exhibited pitting had new plates welded over top. The starboard propeller shafts also required repairs: the mounting brackets were straightened, but the inboard shaft was too badly damaged and had to be replaced. [[Bethlehem Steel]] fabricated a replacement that was installed in June. The bottom row of [[porthole]]s were closed off, as the increase in displacement pushed them closer to the waterline.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=182}}\n\nBeginning in late August and continuing into mid-September, ''Richelieu'' began firing trials in the [[Chesapeake Bay]]; firing the main battery forward on 29 August revealed the need for a blast screen to protect the forecastle 20&nbsp;mm guns, as the test accidentally destroyed two of the guns and their ammunition lockers. With her normal displacement now at {{cvt|43600|t|LT}} and her hull slightly bowed (possibly caused by the torpedo hit), ''Richelieu'' began machinery trials in late September. On 25 September, the ship reached her new top speed of {{cvt|31.5|kn}}, cruising at that speed for thirty minutes, despite the deformation of her hull and the significant increase in displacement. The following day, she steamed for six hours at {{cvt|26.5|kn}}, for two hours at {{cvt|28.9|kn}}, and finally for fifty minutes at {{cvt|30.2|kn}}.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186, 188}}\n\nAs completed, the ship's displacement had grown to {{cvt|43957|t|LT}} normally and {{cvt|47728|t|LT}} fully loaded; draft correspondingly increased to {{cvt|9.22|m}} and {{cvt|10.68|m|0}}, respectively. Compared to her original wartime crew of 1,569&nbsp;officers and men, ''Richelieu'' was now to be manned by a total of 1,930, amounting to 86&nbsp;officers, 287&nbsp;[[petty officer]]s, and 1,557&nbsp;men. The major increase in complement was largely the result of the additional anti-aircraft guns and radar systems. The ship conducted further trials into October, and on the 14th the ship was finally ready to get underway for European waters.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=189}}\n\n=====In European waters=====\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A20935-colourised.jpg|left|thumb|Anti-aircraft gunners aboard ''Richelieu'' during target practice with the British fleet]]\n\nEscorted by the destroyers {{USS|Tarbell}} and {{USS|Ellet||2}}, ''Richelieu'' departed the US on 14 October, nominally bound for [[Gibraltar]]. The destroyers departed while underway, allowing ''Richelieu'' to keep up a speed of {{convert|24|kn}} in heavy seas. The ship stopped in the [[Azores]], Portugal, where she met the French destroyers {{ship|French destroyer|Le Fantasque||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Le Terrible||2}} and the British destroyer {{HMS|Active|H14|2}}, which was limited to a speed of {{cvt|20|kn}}; ''Active'' quickly left the group, which proceeded not to Gibraltar, but to [[Mers El K\u00e9bir]]. There, she replenished supplies; it had been intended to deploy the ship with the Mediterranean Fleet, but Italy had surrendered in September, removing the threat posed by the Italian ''Littorio''-class battleships. ''Richelieu'' was instead sent north to join the [[Home Fleet]], which included the four surviving {{sclass-|King George V|battleship|1||1939}}s. When ''Richelieu'' departed the Mediterranean, Cunningham, now the commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, recommended to the Admiralty that she be fitted with gunnery radars. The ship was escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Musketeer|G86|6}} and {{HMS|Scourge|G01|6}}, and on arrival in [[Scapa Flow]], Admiral [[Bruce Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of North Cape|Bruce Fraser]], the Home Fleet commander, inspected the battleship on 24 November. Work began immediately on installing a Type&nbsp;284 gunnery radar while the ship began an intensive period of training to acclimate the ship's crew to operating with British units.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=190}}\n\nThe ship saw little activity over the winter of 1943\u20131944 until February 1944, when she took part in [[Operation Posthorn]]. ''Richelieu'', the battleship {{HMS|Anson|79|2}}, and the carrier {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} departed Scapa Flow on 10 February for a raid on German shipping off occupied Norway. The objective was to lure the German heavy cruisers in the area so that the two battleships could destroy them. The carrier aircraft achieved little, sinking a single [[Cargo ship|freighter]] of 3,000&nbsp;tons and damaging a [[repair ship]] while trading one of the [[Supermarine Seafire]] [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] for a German [[Bf 109]] fighter. The fleet returned to port on the 12th, and ''Richelieu'' thereafter went to [[Rosyth]] for ten days to rest the crew. A repeat sweep was to have taken place at the end of the month, but two of the escorting destroyers collided while leaving Scapa Flow, leading to a postponement that became permanent as a result of bad weather. In March, the Allies determined that five battleships to counter the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} (which had been damaged in September 1943) was excessive. As a result, ''Richelieu'' was detached for other operations. The Allied command initially considered employing her to support the [[invasion of Normandy]], but as she was only supplied with armor-piercing shells, she was instead sent to reinforce the British [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Eastern Fleet]], along with a group of [[escort aircraft carrier]]s.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=190\u2013191}}{{sfn|Rohwer|pp=307, 313}}\n\nThe ship accordingly steamed to [[Greenock]] to take on fuel and ammunition, before cruising south to the Mediterranean with an escort of three British destroyers. She stopped in [[Algiers]] on 26 March to take on additional supplies; there, she was visited by General [[Henri Giraud]] and Admiral [[Andr\u00e9 Lemonnier]]. ''Richelieu'' thereafter departed for the [[Suez Canal]], steaming at a speed of {{cvt|25|kn}}; while underway, she began to experience significant boiler problems. The boiler blowers were not providing sufficient oxygen, so the boilers were not fully burning the fuel. As a result, the boiler tubes quickly became fouled and caused overheating. ''Richelieu'' stopped in [[Aden]] for repairs to the boiler tubes, but the problem was not corrected.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=192}}\n\n=====First deployment with the British Eastern Fleet=====\n[[File:Renown-9.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' (top left) with the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} (center) and the battleship {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} (top right) during [[Operation Transom]] on 12 May 1944]]\n\nOn entering the [[Indian Ocean]], ''Richelieu'' picked up an escort consisting of the destroyers {{HMS|Rotherham||2}}, {{HMS|Racehorse|H11|2}}, and {{HMS|Quadrant||2}}. The four ships arrived in [[Trincomalee]], [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] on 10 April, where they joined an Allied fleet that included the carriers {{HMS|Illustrious|87|2}} and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}, the battleships {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} and {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|2}}, and numerous cruisers and destroyers, commanded by Admiral [[James Somerville]]. On 16 April, the Eastern Fleet got underway for [[Operation Cockpit]], a diversionary raid to distract the Japanese while American forces [[Battle of Hollandia|landed at Hollandia]] in [[New Guinea]]. Somerville divided his fleet into two squadrons; ''Richelieu'' served in Force 69, the main element, with ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Valiant'', while ''Renown'' operated with the two carriers. The plan for Operation Cockpit called for carrier strikes on the port of [[Sabang, Indonesia|Sabang]], [[Netherlands East Indies]]. The fleet arrived in position early on 19 April, and after the carrier aircraft struck the port, Japanese bombers counter-attacked and ''Richelieu'' engaged the aircraft with her 100&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm batteries.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=192\u2013193}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=319}}\n\nThe next major operation conducted by the Eastern Fleet, [[Operation Transom]], was timed to coincide with American operations in the Central Pacific to keep the attention of the Japanese fleet based in [[Singapore]] focused away from the American fleet. For this operation, the target was the major base at [[Surabaya]], which also had significant oil refinery facilities. The Eastern Fleet got underway on 7 May and stopped to refuel on 15 May before arriving two days later. The strike proceeded uneventfully for ''Richelieu'' and on 18 May the American contingent detached to rejoin the main American fleet in the Pacific while the Eastern Fleet returned to Trincomalee, arriving on 27 May. Two days later, ''Richelieu'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', and six destroyers steamed to [[Colombo]] to rest their crews. While there, ''Richelieu'' was visited by Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]], Supreme Allied Commander of the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|South-East Asia Theatre]]. On 31 May, ''CV'' Merveilleux du Vignaux replaced Marzin as the ship's commander.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=193\u2013194, 199}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=204\u2013205}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=323}}\n\nSomerville planned another raid for mid-June: [[Operation Pedal]], a carrier attack on the harbor of [[Port Blair]] in the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Andaman Islands]]. The purpose of the attack was to again distract the Japanese fleet units in Singapore while American forces embarked on [[Operation Forager]], the invasion of the [[Marianas Islands]]. For the Anglo-French operation, Somerville took only the fast ships, including ''Richelieu'', ''Renown'', and ''Illustrious'' with their accompanying cruiser and destroyer screens. These ships, designated Force 60, sortied on 19 June and two days later, ''Illustrious''{{'}} aircraft struck Japanese targets in the port. The ships arrived back in Trincomalee on 23 June. [[Operation Crimson]] followed in July, and given the lack of a response from the Japanese fleet to the earlier raids, Somerville decided to use his battleships and battlecruiser to bombard Sabang and [[Sumatra]]. ''Richelieu'' and the other ships conducted shooting practice on 7, 14\u201315, and 17 July in preparation for the raid. The plan called for ''Richelieu'', ''Valiant'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', and ''Renown'', supported by cruisers, to shell the port at longer range while the Dutch cruiser {{ship|HNMS|Tromp|1937|2}} led a group of destroyers in a close-range attack. ''Illustrious'', joined by the carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}}, which had recently arrived, provided air cover to the fleet.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=194}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=206\u2013207, 209\u2013214}}{{sfn|Rohwer|pp=334, 344}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu from Saratoga May 1944.jpg|thumb|''Richelieu'' on 18 May 1944 after the conclusion of Operation Transom, taken from USS ''Saratoga'']]\n\nThe Eastern Fleet departed on 22 July and reached the target on the morning of 25 July; the carriers launched their [[combat air patrol]]s and the surface combatants steamed to approach their targets. ''Richelieu'' was the last vessel in the line, astern of ''Renown''. ''Queen Elizabeth'', the leading battleship, opened fire at 06:54 at a range of {{cvt|6000|m}}. The other ships quickly followed suit and [[F4U Corsair]] fighters circled overhead to spot for the ships' guns. ''Richelieu'' fired four-gun salvos, with two guns per turret, and she scored hits with the second salvo, demolishing several buildings and damaging the [[power station]]. Her secondary turrets neutralized a Japanese coastal artillery battery that had been engaging ''Tromp''. At 07:15, the ships ceased firing, and in the brief bombardment, ''Richelieu'' had fired 81&nbsp;main battery shells\u2014this amounted to a [[rate of fire]] of a salvo every 50&nbsp;seconds, nearly twice as fast as the British ships. Japanese aircraft attacked the fleet as it withdrew, but they were kept at bay by the carriers' fighters and heavy anti-aircraft fire from the ships. The fleet arrived back in Trincomalee on 27 July.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\nBy this time, ''Richelieu'' was beginning to suffer from reduced speed, the result of continued boiler trouble and [[biofouling]] of her hull. Admiral [[Laurence E. Power]], who had replaced Somerville as the fleet commander, detached ''Richelieu'' for a refit. The British had initially offered the floating dry-dock ''AFD-28'', but Merveilleux du Vignaux believed that the dry-dock would not be able to accommodate a vessel the size of his ship (he proved to be correct when on 8 August, ''AFD-28'' nearly [[capsize]]d with ''Valiant'' aboard). ''Richelieu'' left on 6 September, bound for Algiers with three escorting destroyers. ''Le Terrible'' and ''Le Fantasque'' took over escort duties after ''Richelieu'' passed through the Suez Canal, and on 23 September the three ships arrived in Algiers. ''Richelieu'' then steamed north to Toulon on 1 October where she was visited again by Lemonnier, but the shipyard there was in ruins, so she moved to Casablanca on 10 October to be refitted. In addition to the hull cleaning and boiler repairs, she had new fire control and search radars installed, including a US SG-1 search radar, British Type-281B air search radar, and Type-285P fire control radars, in addition to other equipment, including an FV1 [[Radio jamming|jammer]] and [[high-frequency direction finding]] gear.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=195}}{{sfn|Lepotier|p=217}}\n\n=====Second deployment with the British Eastern Fleet=====\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A23486.jpg|thumb|Seen from the deck of {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} are ''Valiant'' (center-right) and ''Richelieu'' (right background)]]\n\nOn 23 January 1945, ''Richelieu'' left Casablanca for Gibraltar, arriving there two days later to have her hull cleaned and repainted. The French sought to deploy an independent task force consisting of ''Richelieu'', the four light cruisers still in service, and four destroyers, with a view toward reestablishing French control in [[Indochina]]. But the United States opposed the move and refused to allocate the necessary aircraft carriers and support ships that would have been necessary for another independent fleet, and so ''Richelieu'' could only be sent, alone, back to the Eastern Fleet. The ship conducted trials in February that revealed the problem with her boilers had finally been corrected and she thereafter got underway for Trincomalee, arriving on 20 March. By this time, the modern elements of the Eastern Fleet had been detached to form the [[British Pacific Fleet]], with the Eastern Fleet being renamed the East Indies Fleet. This unit, still under Power's command, consisted of ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Renown'', nine cruisers, ten [[escort carrier]]s, and twenty destroyers. Japanese naval strength at Singapore had also significantly decreased to just four heavy cruisers and several destroyers.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=196}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=195\u2013217}}\n\nFor the next few weeks, ''Richelieu'' was occupied with shooting drills with her primary and secondary batteries and tests for the anti-aircraft radars and command systems. Now assigned to Force 63 of the East Indies Fleet, ''Richelieu'' sortied on 8 April to take part in [[Operation Sunfish]], another bombardment of Sabang while aircraft scouted possible landing beaches near the city of [[Padang]] on the coast of Sumatra. The ships allocated for the operation consisted of ''Richelieu'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', two heavy cruisers, two escort carriers, and five destroyers. Early on 11 April, the two battleships, one of the cruisers, and three destroyers bombarded the island while the other vessels conducted the reconnaissance operation. ''Richelieu'' fired seven salvos with her main battery and used her secondary guns to once again silence the coastal battery on the island. Japanese aircraft launched a poorly-coordinated attack on the battleships but they failed to score any hits. After further carrier operations around Padang, the fleet returned to port on 20 April.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=197}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=408}}\n\nThe next major operation followed a week later. Operation Bishop, a strike against Japanese airfields in the [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]] and [[Andaman Islands]], was to cover British Army landings at [[Rangoon]] in Burma. The plan called for the East Indies Fleet to be divided into multiple groups, each with escorting cruisers and destroyers: four of the escort carriers were to directly support the landings, ''Richelieu'' and ''Queen Elizabeth'' each formed independent surface action groups, and another pair of escort carriers provided air protection for the surface groups. The fleet got underway on 27 April and reached [[Car Nicobar]] two days later. ''Richelieu'' bombarded the airfields at a range of {{cvt|23600|m}}, firing a total of 80&nbsp;main and 45&nbsp;secondary shells. She incurred minor damage to her bow 20&nbsp;mm guns from the blast effects of firing the main battery nearly directly forward. The fleet then proceeded to the Andamans, and at 17:30, ''Richelieu'' opened fire at Port Blair; poor visibility hampered her shooting, and she ceased fire at 18:07, by now having expended the main battery ammunition that had been allotted for the bombardment. She nevertheless returned on 2 May to shell the harbor with her secondary guns, firing 120&nbsp;rounds and inflicting significant damage to the harbor facilities. The fleet steamed north to Rangoon to support the landings, but it was discovered that the Japanese had already withdrawn, allowing the fleet to return to Trincomalee on 8 May.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=198\u2013199}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=412}}\n\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A23483 cropped.jpg|thumb|''Richelieu'' astern of ''Valiant'' during [[Operation Bishop (1945)|Operation Bishop]]]]\n\nA decrypted Japanese radio signal revealed that the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Haguro||2}} and the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Kamikaze|1922|2}} were to steam from Singapore to Port Blair to evacuate the garrison there on the night of 12\u201313 May while another transport vessel would pick up the troops at Car Nicobar. On 9 May, a pair of British submarines spotted ''Haguro'' was it passed through the [[Malacca Strait]], so the East Indies Fleet launched [[Operation Dukedom]] to intercept the Japanese ships. ''Richelieu'' steamed with the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Cumberland|57|6}} as Group 3 of Force 61. Aware that Allied ships were at sea, ''Haguro'' and ''Kamikaze'' turned back, though they were spotted by aircraft from the escort carriers and then sunk by destroyers of the [[26th Destroyer Flotilla]] before ''Richelieu'' and ''Cumberland'' could arrive. Japanese aircraft attacked the fleet as it withdrew back to Trincomalee but were, once again, poorly coordinated and they failed to damage the ships. ''Richelieu'' arrived in port on 18 May.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=199}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=417}}\n\nOn arrival, the ship took on additional ammunition and fuel, and over the coming weeks, she underwent repairs to her boilers and took part in shooting practice. The bombardments carried out earlier in the year had revealed excessive dispersion of the main battery shells, particularly if both guns on one side of the turret were fired at the same time. The crew at that time was unable to determine the cause of the problem, though tests with the remanufactured ''Strasbourg'' charges reduced the problem. On 3 June, the destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Le Triomphant||2}} arrived with spare equipment for ''Richelieu'', which was sent to [[Durban]] for another refit. Her hull again needed to be scraped and her boilers required a re-tubing. The ship had to stop in [[Diego-Suarez|Diego Suarez]] on the way to disembark non-white crewmen at the request of the racist government of [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]; though this caused resentment among the crew, the French nevertheless complied. ''Richelieu'' arrived on 18 July and work lasted from 31 July to 10 August. Thirteen of the ship's 20&nbsp;mm guns were replaced with four 40&nbsp;mm guns, as the lighter weapons had proved to be ineffective against [[kamikaze]]s. The ship conducted training and trials of South Africa before departing for Diego Suarez, ultimately arriving back in Trincomalee on 18 August, by which time [[surrender of Japan|Japan had surrendered]].{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=199\u2013200}}{{sfn|Sarnet & Le Vaillant|pp=325, 329}}\n\n=== Postwar era===\nImmediately after the surrender of Japan, French and British forces began their attempts to reassert control in their Japanese-occupied colonies. On 7 September, ''Richelieu'' got underway in company with the British battleship {{HMS|Nelson|28|2}} to take part in [[Operation Zipper]], the amphibious landing on Sumatra. Two days later, ''Richelieu'' detonated a magnetic mine, though she suffered only minor damage; the force of the blast pushed in some hull plates by {{cvt|10|to|12|cm}} and inflicted minor shock damage to the lighting system, but the vessel remained with the fleet. After landing the troops with no opposition, ''Richelieu'' moved to Singapore on 11 September to participate in [[Operation Tiderace]], the liberation of the city, the following day. She returned to Trincomalee on 16 September before getting underway again on 27 September, bound for Indochina. She steamed with ''Le Triomphant'' as escorts for the transport ships {{SS|Queen Emma||2}} and {{SS|Princess Beatrix||2}}, which carried French soldiers to restore colonial rule in Indochina. French rule was opposed by the [[Viet Minh]], and on arrival ''Richelieu'' was used to support the forces ashore in a variety of capacities: she served as a staging area, hospital, artillery support, and troop transport. She also contributed a landing party to the forces fighting to reassert French control.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=200\u2013201}}{{sfn|Sarnet & Le Vaillant|pp=330\u2013334}}{{sfn|Rohwer|pp=429, 432}}\n\n''Richelieu'', ''Le Triomphant'', and ''Le Fantasque'' took part in [[Operation Mapor]] at [[Nha Trang]] from 20 to 26 November, providing heavy fire support to soldiers fighting in the area. By this time, a French squadron consisting of the aircraft carrier {{ship|French aircraft carrier|B\u00e9arn||2}} and the cruisers {{ship|French cruiser|Gloire|1935|2}}, {{ship|French cruiser|Suffren||2}}, and {{ship|French cruiser|\u00c9mile Bertin||2}} had arrived in mid-October, allowing ''Richelieu'' to be returned to France. Before leaving, ''Richelieu'' sent her four single 40&nbsp;mm guns and most of her 20&nbsp;mm guns ashore, along with a considerable stockpile of ammunition for the guns and 152&nbsp;mm shells. She departed on 29 December and arrived in Toulon on 11 February 1946, thereafter taking part in the transport effort to send French soldiers back from France to North Africa. With that completed, she steamed north to [[Cherbourg]], arriving to be dry-docked on 16 March. Repairs lasted until 20 July, and consisted of replacing the starboard propeller, correcting the hull damage from the mine in September 1945, and thoroughly overhauling her boilers.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=200\u2013201}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=432}}\n\nWith the repairs completed, ''Richelieu'' sailed to Britain to carry the crew for the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Colossus|R15|6}}, which was to be loaned to the French for five years, serving as ''Arromanches''. ''Richelieu'' thereafter began a training cruise that included stops in Casablanca, Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, and Dakar. Later that year, she visited Portugal in company with ''Arromanches''. She returned to Brest for modifications to the secondary battery from February to March 1947. The ship thereafter formed the core of a battle group that included three ex-German destroyers, based in Cherbourg. The group, along with a carrier group centered on ''Arromanches'' and cruiser group, both based in Toulon, were combined to form the ''Force d'Intervention'', with ''Richelieu'' as the flagship of ''[[Vice Amiral]]'' (Vice Admiral) [[Robert Jaujard]]. The unit embarked on a training cruise to Africa in May and June, beginning with the three groups assembling in Casablanca on 8 May. ''Richelieu'' arrived back in Cherbourg on 13 June and began a period of maintenance and training of new crew members. Another training cruise to North Africa followed late in 1947, and while there she conducted shooting practice to try to determine the cause of the excessive shell dispersion. The subsequent installation of 60-millisecond delays to the firing circuits of the outer guns in the turrets created enough space between the shells that they did not disrupt each other in flight, significantly improving the issue.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=201\u2013204}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=285\u2013289}}{{sfn|Dumas|pp=43, 74}}\n\nThe ''Force d'Intervention'' was reactivated for another cruise in early 1948; the three constituent groups rendezvoused at Toulon and then conducted training exercises off North Africa. While in Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, the ship was slightly damaged while being moored in the port. Following the conclusion of the maneuvers, the force was disbanded and ''Richelieu'' steamed north to Brest, arriving on 29 May. The ship was in need of a thorough refit, and she was dry-docked in Cherbourg from August to September to survey the work that would be needed to be done. Jaujard left the ship and her crew was reduced to 750&nbsp;men. Since the French naval budget was in a very limited state owing to the wrecked French economy in the immediate postwar years, ''Richelieu''{{'}}s refit was postponed to allow the funds to be used to complete ''Jean Bart'' instead. ''Richelieu'' was accordingly placed in reserve on 1 April 1949. The refit eventually began on 1 January 1950 and lasted until 24 October 1951, and it included a thorough overhaul of her propulsion machinery, replacement of her worn main and secondary battery guns, and repairs to her anti-aircraft battery, along with other modifications.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n[[File:Canon Richelieu Brest.jpg|thumb|One of the two remaining 380 mm guns of ''Richelieu'', by the Penfeld river in [[Brest, France|Brest]]]]\n\nDuring the refit, it was decided that the ship's anti-aircraft battery was too dated to allow the ship to operate in the era of jet aircraft; coupled with the need to update the ship's radar and electronics and install more capable command spaces, the costs would have been prohibitively high for the French Navy. Instead of fully modernizing the vessel, the navy decided to employ ''Richelieu'' as a [[training ship]] in the gunnery school in February 1951. After completing the refit, the ship underwent trials in November that involved firing nine rounds per gun from the main battery; this would be the last time ''Richelieu'' fired the 380&nbsp;mm guns. Beginning in May 1952, the ship was based in Toulon as the flagship of ''CA'' Champion, and she spent the next few years conducting shooting practice with the secondary and smaller weapons to train the fleet's gunners. Another refit followed from October 1953 to February 1954. This involved replacing the British gunnery radar with a French-built set.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=205\u2013206}}\n\nFor the first and last time of either of their careers, ''Richelieu'' and ''Jean Bart'' cruised together on 30 January 1956. The ship's career as a sea-going gunnery ship ended in February, when she was [[:wikt:laid up|laid up]] in Brest. To prepare ''Richelieu'' for [[reserve fleet|reserve]], dehumidifiers were installed in the secondary turrets to inhibit rust and the 100&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm quad mounts were covered. The single 40&nbsp;mm guns and all of the 20&nbsp;mm guns still aboard the vessel were removed. She was thereafter used as a stationary school ship for reserve officers and as a [[barracks ship|floating barracks]] until 30 September 1967, when she was struck from the [[naval register]]. Renamed ''Q432'', she was condemned on 16 January 1968 and sold to the Genoa-based [[ship breaker]] Cantieri Navali Santa Maria in September.

Many [[speedcubing|speedcubers]] continue to practice it and similar puzzles; they also compete for the fastest times in various categories. Since 2003, the [[World Cube Association]], the Rubik's Cube's international governing body, has organised competitions worldwide and recognises world records.\n\n==Conception and development==\n===Similar precursors===\n[[File:Patent US3655201.png|thumb|Diagram from Nichols' patent showing a cube held together with magnets]]\n\nIn March 1970, [[Larry D. Nichols]] invented a 2\u00d72\u00d72 \"Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups\" and filed a Canadian patent application for it. Nichols's cube was held together by magnets. Nichols was granted {{US patent|3655201}} on 11 April 1972, two years before Rubik invented his Cube.\n\nOn 9 April 1970, Frank Fox applied to patent an \"amusement device\", a type of [[sliding puzzle]] on a spherical surface with \"at least two 3\u00d73 arrays\" intended to be used for the game of [[noughts and crosses]].

Magic Cube was held together with interlocking plastic pieces that prevented the puzzle being easily pulled apart, unlike the magnets in Nichols's design. With Ern\u0151 Rubik's permission, businessman Tibor Laczi took a Cube to Germany's [[Nuremberg]] Toy Fair in February 1979 in an attempt to popularise it.<ref name=\"holper\">{{Cite book|last=Holper|first=Paul|title=Inventing Millions|year=2006|pages=64\u20135|publisher=Orient|isbn=8122204589}}</ref> It was noticed by Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer and they signed a deal with [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal Toys]] in September 1979 to release the Magic Cube worldwide.<ref name=\"holper\"/> Ideal wanted at least a recognisable name to trademark; of course, that arrangement put Rubik in the spotlight because the Magic Cube was renamed after its inventor in 1980.

A lighter Cube was produced, and Ideal decided to rename it. \"[[Gordian Knot|The Gordian Knot]]\" and \"Inca Gold\" were considered, but the company finally decided on \"Rubik's Cube\", and the first batch was exported from Hungary in May 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.rubiks.com/about/|title=About |publisher=Rubiks |date=25 January 2019 |accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Subsequent history==\n{{See also|Rubik's Cube in popular culture}}\n\n===1980s Cube craze===\nAfter the first batches of Rubik's Cubes were released in May 1980, initial sales were modest, but Ideal began a television advertising campaign in the middle of the year which it supplemented with newspaper adverts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/30/business/advertising-ideal-toy-s-son-of-rubik-cube.html|last=Dougherty|first=Philip H.|title=Advertising Ideal Toy's Son of Rubik Cube|date=30 July 1981|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> At the end of 1980 Rubik's Cube won a [[Spiel des Jahres|German Game of the Year]] special award,<ref name=\"carlisle\">{{Cite book|last=Carlisle|first=Rodney P.|title=Encyclopedia of Play in Today's Society|year=2009|page=612|publisher=SAGE|isbn=1452266107}}</ref> and won similar awards for best toy in the UK, France, and the US.<ref name=\"europa\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.create2009.europa.eu/ambassadors/profiles/erno_rubik.html|title=Interview with Ern\u0151 Rubik|publisher=Europa|access-date=26 October 2016}}</ref> By 1981 Rubik's Cube had become a craze, and it is estimated that in the period from 1980 to 1983 around 200 million Rubik's Cubes were sold worldwide.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Singmaster|first1=David|author-link1=David Singmaster|chapter=The Utility of Recreational Mathematics|editor1-last=Guy|editor1-first=Richard K.|editor2-last=Woodrow|editor2-first=Robert E.|title=The Lighter Side of Mathematics: Proceedings of the Eug\u00e8ne Strens Memorial Conference on Recreational Mathematics and Its History|year=1994|page=[https://archive.org/details/lightersideofmat0000unse/page/340 340]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=088385516X|url=https://archive.org/details/lightersideofmat0000unse/page/340}} Singmaster [http://www.cube20.org/cubelovers/CL28/046.txt estimates] the numbers sold were between 100 and 300 million.

The puzzle consists of twenty-six unique miniature cubes, also called \"cubies\" or \"cubelets\". Each of these includes a concealed inward extension that interlocks with the other cubes while permitting them to move to different locations. However, the centre cube of each of the six faces is merely a single square fa\u00e7ade; all six are affixed to the core mechanism. These provide structure for the other pieces to fit into and rotate around. So there are twenty-one pieces: a single core piece consisting of three intersecting axes holding the six centre squares in place but letting them rotate, and twenty smaller plastic pieces which fit into it to form the assembled puzzle.\n\nEach of the six centre pieces pivots on a screw (fastener) held by the centre piece, a \"3D cross\". A spring between each screw head and its corresponding piece tensions the piece inward, so that collectively, the whole assembly remains compact, but can still be easily manipulated. The screw can be tightened or loosened to change the \"feel\" of the Cube. Newer official Rubik's brand cubes have rivets instead of screws and cannot be adjusted.\n\nThe Cube can be taken apart without much difficulty, typically by rotating the top layer by 45\u00b0 and then prying one of its edge cubes away from the other two layers. Consequently, it is a simple process to \"solve\" a Cube by taking it apart and reassembling it in a solved state.\n\nThere are six central pieces which show one coloured face, twelve edge pieces which show two coloured faces, and eight corner pieces which show three coloured faces. Each piece shows a unique colour combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, if red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting an outer third of the Cube by increments of 90 degrees, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares. However, Cubes with alternative colour arrangements also exist; for example, with the yellow face opposite the green, the blue face opposite the white, and red and orange remaining opposite each other.\n\n[[Douglas Hofstadter]], in the July 1982 issue of ''Scientific American'', pointed out that Cubes could be coloured in such a way as to emphasise the corners or edges, rather than the faces as the standard colouring does; but neither of these alternative colourings has ever become popular.<ref name=\"hofstadter\"/>\n\n==Mathematics==\nThe puzzle was originally advertised as having \"over 3,000,000,000 (three [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]) combinations but only one solution\".<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTkhA3RO5fU|title=Rubik's Cube Commercial 1981|last=TELEVISIONARCHIVES|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=10 October 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>  Depending on how combinations are counted, the actual number can be significantly higher.\n\n===Permutations===\n[[File:Rubik's cube colors.svg|thumb|The current colour scheme of a Rubik's Cube]]\nThe original (3\u00d73\u00d73) Rubik's Cube has eight corners and twelve edges. There are [[factorial|8!]] (40,320) ways to arrange the corner cubes. Each corner has three possible orientations, although only seven (of eight) can be oriented independently; the orientation of the eighth (final) corner depends on the preceding seven, giving 3<sup>7</sup> (2,187) possibilities. There are 12!/2 (239,500,800) ways to arrange the edges, restricted from 12! because edges must be in an [[even permutation]] exactly when the corners are. (When arrangements of centres are also permitted, as described below, the rule is that the combined arrangement of corners, edges, and centres must be an even permutation.) Eleven edges can be flipped independently, with the flip of the twelfth depending on the preceding ones, giving 2<sup>11</sup> (2,048) possibilities.<ref>Martin Sch\u00f6nert ''[http://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Examples/rubik.html \"Analyzing Rubik's Cube with GAP\"]'': the [[permutation group]] of Rubik's Cube is examined with [[GAP computer algebra system]]</ref>\n:<math> {8! \\times 3^7 \\times (12!/2) \\times 2^{11}} = 43,252,003,274,489,856,000</math>\n\nwhich is approximately 43 [[quintillion]].<ref name=\"Vaughen\">[http://faculty.mc3.edu/cvaughen/rubikscube/cube_counting.ppt Counting the Permutations of the Rubik's Cube], Scott Vaughen.

If one considers permutations reached through disassembly of the cube, the number becomes twelve times larger:\n:<math> {8! \\times 3^8 \\times 12! \\times 2^{12}} = 519,024,039,293,878,272,000.</math>\n\nwhich is approximately 519 quintillion<ref name=\"Vaughen\"/> possible arrangements of the pieces that make up the Cube, but only one in twelve of these are actually solvable. This is because there is no sequence of moves that will swap a single pair of pieces or rotate a single corner or edge cube. Thus there are twelve possible sets of reachable configurations, sometimes called \"universes\" or \"[[orbit (group theory)|orbits]]\", into which the Cube can be placed by dismantling and reassembling it.\n\nThe preceding numbers assume the center faces are in a fixed position.  If one considers turning the whole cube to be a different permutation, then each of the preceding numbers should be multiplied by 24.  A chosen color can be on one of six sides, and then one of the adjacent colors can be in one of four positions; this determines the positions of all remaining colors.\n\n===Centre faces===\nThe original Rubik's Cube had no orientation markings on the centre faces (although some carried the words \"Rubik's Cube\" on the centre square of the white face), and therefore solving it does not require any attention to orienting those faces correctly. However, with marker pens, one could, for example, mark the central squares of an unscrambled Cube with four coloured marks on each edge, each corresponding to the colour of the adjacent face; a cube marked in this way is referred to as a \"supercube\". Some Cubes have also been produced commercially with markings on all of the squares, such as the [[Lo Shu Square|Lo Shu]] [[magic square]] or [[playing card]] [[suit (cards)|suits]]. Cubes have also been produced where the nine stickers on a face are used to make a single larger picture, and centre orientation matters on these as well. Thus one can nominally solve a Cube yet have the markings on the centres rotated; it then becomes an additional test to solve the centres as well.\n\nMarking the Rubik's Cube's centres increases its difficulty because this expands the set of distinguishable possible configurations. There are 4<sup>6</sup>/2 (2,048) ways to orient the centres since an even permutation of the corners implies an even number of quarter turns of centres as well. In particular, when the Cube is unscrambled apart from the orientations of the central squares, there will always be an even number of centre squares requiring a quarter turn. Thus orientations of centres increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (4.3\u00d710<sup>19</sup>) to 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9\u00d710<sup>22</sup>).<ref>''Scientific American'', p28, '''vol 246''', 1982 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vDo7AAAAMAAJ&q=orientations+of+face+centers+matter&dq=orientations+of+face+centers+matter&lr=&pgis=1 retrieved online] 29 January 2009.</ref>\n\nWhen turning a cube over is considered to be a change in permutation then we must also count arrangements of the centre faces. Nominally there are 6! ways to arrange the six centre faces of the cube, but only 24 of these are achievable without disassembly of the cube. When the orientations of centres are also counted, as above, this increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9\u00d710<sup>22</sup>) to 2,125,922,464,947,725,402,112,000 (2.1\u00d710<sup>24</sup>).\n\n===Algorithms===\nIn Rubik's cubers' parlance, a memorised sequence of moves that has a desired effect on the cube is called an algorithm. This terminology is derived from the mathematical use of ''[[algorithm]]'', meaning a list of well-defined instructions for performing a task from a given initial state, through well-defined successive states, to a desired end-state. Each method of solving the Rubik's Cube employs its own set of algorithms, together with descriptions of what effect the algorithm has, and when it can be used to bring the cube closer to being solved.\n\nMany algorithms are designed to transform only a small part of the cube without interfering with other parts that have already been solved so that they can be applied repeatedly to different parts of the cube until the whole is solved. For example, there are well-known algorithms for cycling three corners without changing the rest of the puzzle or flipping the orientation of a pair of edges while leaving the others intact.\n\nSome algorithms do have a certain desired effect on the cube (for example, swapping two corners) but may also have the side-effect of changing other parts of the cube (such as permuting some edges). Such algorithms are often simpler than the ones without side-effects and are employed early on in the solution when most of the puzzle has not yet been solved and the side-effects are not important. Most are long and difficult to memorise. Towards the end of the solution, the more specific (and usually more complicated) algorithms are used instead.\n\n===Relevance and application of mathematical group theory===\nRubik's Cube lends itself to the application of [[Rubik's Cube group|mathematical group theory]], which has been helpful for deducing certain algorithms \u2013 in particular, those which have a ''[[commutator]]'' structure, namely ''XYX''<sup>\u22121</sup>''Y''<sup>\u22121</sup> (where ''X'' and ''Y'' are specific moves or move-sequences and ''X''<sup>\u22121</sup> and ''Y''<sup>\u22121</sup> are their respective inverses), or a ''[[Conjugation (group theory)|conjugate]]'' structure, namely ''XYX''<sup>\u22121</sup>, often referred to by speedcubers colloquially as a \"setup move\".<ref name=\"Singmaster\"/> In addition, the fact that there are well-defined [[subgroup]]s within the [[Rubik's Cube group]] enables the puzzle to be learned and mastered by moving up through various self-contained \"levels of difficulty\". For example, one such \"level\" could involve solving cubes which have been scrambled using only 180-degree turns. These subgroups are the principle underlying the computer cubing methods by [[Morwen Thistlethwaite#Thistlethwaite's algorithm|Thistlethwaite]] and [[Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube#Kociemba's algorithm|Kociemba]], which solve the cube by further reducing it to another subgroup.\n\n==Solutions==\n===Move notation===\nMany 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube enthusiasts use a notation developed by [[David Singmaster]] to denote a sequence of moves, referred to as \"Singmaster notation\".<ref name=\"advgroup\">{{Cite book |author=Joyner, David |title=Adventures in group theory: Rubik's Cube, Merlin's machine, and Other Mathematical Toys |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2002 |page=[https://archive.org/details/adventuresingrou0000joyn/page/7 7] |isbn=0-8018-6947-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/adventuresingrou0000joyn/page/7 }}</ref> Its relative nature allows [[algorithms]] to be written in such a way that they can be applied regardless of which side is designated the top or how the colours are organised on a particular cube.\n* ''F'' (Front): the side currently facing the solver\n* ''B'' (Back): the side opposite the front\n* ''U'' (Up): the side above or on top of the front side\n* ''D'' (Down): the side opposite the top, underneath the Cube\n* ''L'' (Left): the side directly to the left of the front\n* ''R'' (Right): the side directly to the right of the front\n* ''\u0192'' (Front two layers): the side facing the solver and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''b'' (Back two layers): the side opposite the front and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''u'' (Up two layers): the top side and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''d'' (Down two layers): the bottom layer and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''l'' (Left two layers): the side to the left of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''r'' (Right two layers): the side to the right of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''x'' (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on ''R''\n* ''y'' (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on ''U''\n* ''z'' (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on ''F''\n\nWhen a [[Prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] (&nbsp;\u2032&nbsp;) follows a letter, it denotes an anticlockwise face turn; while a letter without a prime symbol denotes a clockwise turn. These directions are as one is looking at the specified face.  A letter followed by a&nbsp;2 (occasionally a superscript&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>) denotes two turns, or a 180-degree turn. ''R'' is right side clockwise, but ''R\u2032'' is right side anticlockwise. The letters ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are used to indicate that the entire Cube should be turned about one of its axes, corresponding to R, U, and F turns respectively. When ''x'', ''y'', or ''z'' are primed, it is an indication that the cube must be rotated in the opposite direction. When they are squared, the cube must be rotated 180 degrees. <!-- Which axis (x, y, z) is which? user Nikevich -->\n\nThe most common deviation from Singmaster notation, and in fact the current official standard, is to use \"w\", for \"wide\", instead of lowercase letters to represent moves of two layers; thus, a move of ''Rw'' is equivalent to one of ''r''.<ref name=wcarules>{{cite web|title=World Cube Association Competition Regulations|url=http://worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor methods using middle-layer turns (particularly corners-first methods), there is a generally accepted \"MES\" extension to the notation where letters ''M'', ''E'', and ''S'' denote middle layer turns. It was used e.g. in Marc Waterman's Algorithm.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Treep |first1=Anneke |last2=Waterman |first2=Marc |title=Marc Waterman's Algorithm, Part 2 |series=Cubism For Fun 15 |year=1987 |publisher=Nederlandse Kubus Club |page=10}}</ref>\n* ''M'' (Middle): the layer between L and R, turn direction as L (top-down)\n* ''E'' (Equator): the layer between U and D, turn direction as D (left-right)\n* ''S'' (Standing): the layer between F and B, turn direction as F\n\nThe 4\u00d74\u00d74 and larger cubes use an extended notation to refer to the additional middle layers. Generally speaking, uppercase letters (''F B U D L R'') refer to the outermost portions of the cube (called faces). Lowercase letters (''f b u d l r'') refer to the inner portions of the cube (called slices). An asterisk (L*), a number in front of it (2L), or two layers in parentheses (Ll), means to turn the two layers at the same time (both the inner and the outer left faces) For example: (''Rr'')<nowiki>'</nowiki>&nbsp;''l''2&nbsp;''f''<nowiki>'</nowiki> means to turn the two rightmost layers anticlockwise, then the left inner layer twice, and then the inner front layer anticlockwise. By extension, for cubes of 6\u00d76\u00d76 and larger, moves of three layers are notated by the number 3, for example, 3L.\n\nAn alternative notation, Wolstenholme notation,<ref>http://www.topaccolades.com/notation/rubikscube.htm Wolstenholme notation</ref> is designed to make memorising sequences of moves easier for novices.  This notation uses the same letters for faces except it replaces U with T (top), so that all are consonants.  The key difference is the use of the vowels O, A, and I for cl'''o'''ckwise, '''a'''nticlockwise, and tw'''i'''ce (180-degree) turns, which results in word-like sequences such as LOTA RATO LATA ROTI (equivalent to LU\u2032R\u2032UL\u2032U\u2032RU2 in Singmaster notation). Addition of a C implies rotation of the entire cube, so ROC is the clockwise rotation of the cube around its right face. Middle layer moves are denoted by adding an M to corresponding face move, so RIM means a 180-degree turn of the middle layer adjacent to the R face.\n\nAnother notation appeared in the 1981 book ''[[The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube]]''. Singmaster notation was not widely known at the time of publication. The faces were named Top (T), Bottom (B), Left (L), Right (R), Front (F), and Posterior (P), with + for clockwise, \u2013 for anticlockwise, and 2 for 180-degree turns.\n\nAnother notation appeared in the 1982 \"The Ideal Solution\" book for Rubik's Revenge. Horizontal planes were noted as tables, with table 1 or T1 starting at the top. Vertical front to back planes were noted as books, with book 1 or B1 starting from the left. Vertical left to right planes were noted as windows, with window 1 or W1 starting at the front. Using the front face as a reference view, table moves were left or right, book moves were up or down, and window moves were clockwise or anticlockwise.\n\n===Optimal solutions===\n{{Main|Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube}}\n[[File:1982 expedition to Tartu \u00dclikool 350 (23).jpg|thumb|[[Mountaineering|Mountaineer]] solving Rubik's Cube during 1982 expedition in [[Pamir Mountains]] to peak [[Tartu \u00dclikool 350]]]]\n\nAlthough there are a significant number of possible permutations for the Rubik's Cube, a number of solutions have been developed which allow solving the cube in well under 100 moves.\n\nMany general solutions for the Rubik's Cube have been discovered independently.

This method is called [[CFOP]] standing for \"cross, F2L, OLL, PLL\".  It is similar to the layer-by-layer method but employs the use of a large number of algorithms, especially for orienting and permuting the last layer. The cross is done first, followed by first layer corners and second layer edges simultaneously, with each corner paired up with a second-layer edge piece, thus completing the first two layers (F2L). This is then followed by [[Orientation (geometry)|orienting]] the last layer, then [[permutation|permuting]] the last layer (OLL and PLL respectively). [[Fridrich method|Fridrich's solution]] requires learning roughly 120 algorithms but allows the Cube to be solved in only 55 moves on average.\n\nA now well-known method was developed by [[Lars Petrus]]. In this method, a 2\u00d72\u00d72 section is solved first, followed by a 2\u00d72\u00d73, and then the incorrect edges are solved using a three-move algorithm, which eliminates the need for a possible 32-move algorithm later. The principle behind this is that in layer-by-layer, one must constantly break and fix the completed layer(s); the 2\u00d72\u00d72 and 2\u00d72\u00d73 sections allow three or two layers (respectively) to be turned without ruining progress. One of the advantages of this method is that it tends to give solutions in fewer moves. For this reason, the method is also popular for fewest move competitions.<ref name=larspatrus>{{cite web|url=https://lar5.com/cube/ |title=Rubik's Cube Solution - Petrus Method |publisher=lar5.com |accessdate=8 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Roux Method, developed by [[Gilles Roux]], is similar to the Petrus method in that it relies on block building rather than layers, but derives from corners-first methods. In Roux, a 3\u00d72\u00d71 block is solved, followed by another 3\u00d72\u00d71 on the opposite side. Next, the corners of the top layer are solved. The cube can then be solved using only moves of the U layer and M slice.<ref name=rouxmeth>{{cite web|url=http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html |title=Introduction |publisher=Grrroux.free.fr |accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Beginners' methods===\nMost beginner solution methods involve solving the cube one layer at a time, using algorithms that preserve what has already been solved.

Their recorded time for this event includes both the time spent memorizing the cube and the time spent manipulating it.\n\nIn Multiple Blindfolded, all of the cubes are memorised, and then all of the cubes are solved once blindfolded; thus, the main challenge is memorising many&nbsp;\u2013 often ten or more&nbsp;\u2013 separate cubes. The event is scored not by time but by the number of points achieved after the one hour time limit has elapsed. The number of points achieved is equal to the number of cubes solved correctly, minus the number of cubes unsolved after the end of the attempt, where a greater number of points is better. If multiple competitors achieve the same number of points, rankings are assessed based on the total time of the attempt, with a shorter time being better.\n\nIn Fewest Moves solving, the contestant is given one hour to find a solution and must write it down.\n\n===Records===\n\n====Competition records====\n\n* Single time: The world record time for solving a 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube is 3.47 seconds, held by Du Yusheng (\u675c\u5b87\u751f) of China, on 24 November 2018 at Wuhu Open 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/e.php?i=333|title=World Cube Association - Official Results|last=Team|first=WCA Website|website=www.worldcubeassociation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}</ref>\n* Average time: The world record average of the middle three of five solve times (which excludes the fastest and slowest) is 5.53 seconds, set by [[Feliks Zemdegs]] of Australia at Odd Day at Sydney 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=333&regionId=&years=&show=100+Results&average=Average|title=World Cube Association \u2013 Official Results|first=WCA Website|last=Team|website=worldcubeassociation.org|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n* One-handed solving: The world record fastest one-handed solve is 6.82 seconds, set by [[Max Park]] of the United States on 12 October 2019 at Bay Area Speedcubin' 20 2019.

Sliding a finger across its faces causes its patterns of coloured lights to rotate the same way they would on a mechanical cube. The TouchCube also has buttons for hints and self-solving, and it includes a charging stand. The TouchCube was introduced at the [[American International Toy Fair]] in New York on 15 February 2009.<ref name=\"reutersny\">{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUKN1546558020090216?sp=true |title=NY Toy Fair opens with new Rubik's Cube, Lego deals|accessdate=23 March 2009 | agency=Reuters | date=16 February 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"ny1elec\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ny1.com/Content/Top_Stories/93988/toy-fair-kicks-off-at-javits-center/Default.aspx|title=Toy Fair Kicks Off at Javits Center|accessdate=23 March 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422104222/http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/93988/toy-fair-kicks-off-at-javits-center/Default.aspx|archivedate=22 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe Cube has inspired an entire category of similar puzzles, commonly referred to as ''[[Combination puzzles|twisty puzzles]]'', which includes the cubes of different sizes mentioned above as well as various other geometric shapes. Some such shapes include the [[tetrahedron]] ([[Pyraminx]]), the [[octahedron]] ([[Skewb Diamond]]), the [[dodecahedron]] ([[Megaminx]]), and the [[icosahedron]] ([[Dogic]]). There are also puzzles that change shape such as [[Rubik's Snake]] and the [[Square One (puzzle)|Square One]].\n\nIn 2011, [[Guinness World Records]] awarded the \"largest order Rubiks magic cube\" to a 17\u00d717\u00d717 cube, made by [[Oskar van Deventer]].<ref name=\"largestguinness\">{{cite web |title=Largest Order Rubiks / Magic Cube |work=Guinness World Records |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/11000/largest-order-rubiks-magic-cube |accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=van Deventer|first=Oskar|title=Over the Top \u2013 17x17x17|url=http://www.shapeways.com/model/64058/over-the-top-17x17x17.html}}</ref> On 2 December 2017, [[Gr\u00e9goire Pfennig]] announced that he had broken this record, with a 33\u00d733\u00d733 cube, and that his claim had been submitted to Guinness for verification.<ref name=\"cube33\"/> On 8 April 2018, Gr\u00e9goire Pfennig announced another world record, the 2x2x50 cube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIP3lmQHXg|title=World Record 2x2x50 Rubik's Cube !!! :D|last=Greg's Puzzles|date=8 April 2018|accessdate=13 April 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> Whether this is a replacement for the 33x33x33 record, or an additional record, remains to be seen.\n\n[[File:Rubiks Platonic Solids.jpg|thumb|All five platonic solids represented by twisty puzzles]]\n\nSome puzzles have also been created in the shape of the [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]], such as [[Alexander's Star]] (a [[great dodecahedron]]). Gr\u00e9goire Pfennig has also created at least one puzzle in the shape of a [[small stellated dodecahedron]].\n\n===Custom-built puzzles===\n[[File:Novelty Keychain Rubiks Cube.JPG|thumb|Novelty keychain]]\n\nPuzzles have been built resembling the Rubik's Cube or based on its inner workings. For example, a cuboid is a puzzle based on the Rubik's Cube, but with different functional dimensions, such as 2\u00d72\u00d74, 2\u00d73\u00d74, and 3\u00d73\u00d75.<ref>Martin, W. Eric. \"Gamebits: Rubik's Cube... Cubed\". ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]''. Issue 199 (Vol. 28 No. 3). p. 4. April 2004.</ref> Many cuboids are based on 4\u00d74\u00d74 or 5\u00d75\u00d75 mechanisms, via building plastic extensions or by directly modifying the mechanism itself.\n\nSome custom puzzles are not derived from any existing mechanism, such as the Gigaminx v1.5-v2, Bevel Cube, SuperX, Toru, Rua, and 1\u00d72\u00d73. These puzzles usually have a set of masters 3D printed, which then are copied using moulding and casting techniques to create the final puzzle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nOther Rubik's Cube modifications include cubes that have been extended or truncated to form a new shape. An example of this is the Trabjer's Octahedron, which can be built by truncating and extending portions of a regular 3\u00d73\u00d73. Most shape mods can be adapted to higher-order cubes. In the case of [[Tony Fisher (puzzle designer)|Tony Fisher's]] Rhombic Dodecahedron, there are 3\u00d73\u00d73, 4\u00d74\u00d74, 5\u00d75\u00d75, and 6\u00d76\u00d76 versions of the puzzle.\n\n=== Rubik's Cube software ===\n[[Puzzle]]s like the Rubik's Cube can be simulated by [[computer software]], which provides functions such as recording of player metrics, storing scrambled Cube positions, conducting online competitions, analysing of move sequences, and converting between different move [[notation]]s. Software can also simulate very large puzzles that are impractical to build, such as 100\u00d7100\u00d7100 and 1,000\u00d71,000\u00d71,000 cubes, as well as virtual puzzles that cannot be physically built, such as 4- and 5-dimensional analogues of the cube.<ref>{{cite web|author=Melinda Green |url=http://www.superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm |title=Magic Cube 4D |publisher=Superliminal.com |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gravitation3d.com/magiccube5d |title=Magic Cube 5D |publisher=Gravitation3d.com |accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"185px\">\nFile:4-cube 4^4.png|Magic Cube 4D, a [[Tesseract|4\u00d74\u00d74\u00d74]] virtual puzzle\nFile:5D Rubik's Cube.png|Magic Cube 5D, a 3\u00d73\u00d73\u00d73\u00d73 virtual puzzle\nFile:4d cube.png|high-dimensional Octagon Magic Cube Puzzle simulated phone application\nFile:4-cube 2^4 highlighted.png|4D virtual 2x2x2x2 sequential move puzzle\n</gallery>\n\n===Chrome Cube Lab===\nGoogle has released the Chrome Cube Lab in association with<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Calvin|last2=Goldstine|first2=Susan|date=September 2014|title=Review: Beyond Rubik's Cube Exhibit|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=45|pages=254\u2013256|doi=10.4169/college.math.j.45.4.254|jstor=10.4169/college.math.j.45.4.254}}</ref> [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]].

For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to have only one colour. Similar puzzles have now been produced with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and stickers, not all of them by Rubik.\n\nAlthough the Rubik's Cube reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1980s, it is still widely known and used. Many [[speedcubing|speedcubers]] continue to practice it and similar puzzles; they also compete for the fastest times in various categories. Since 2003, the [[World Cube Association]], the Rubik's Cube's international governing body, has organised competitions worldwide and recognises world records.\n\n==Conception and development==\n===Similar precursors===\n[[File:Patent US3655201.png|thumb|Diagram from Nichols' patent showing a cube held together with magnets]]\n\nIn March 1970, [[Larry D. Nichols]] invented a 2\u00d72\u00d72 \"Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups\" and filed a Canadian patent application for it. Nichols's cube was held together by magnets. Nichols was granted {{US patent|3655201}} on 11 April 1972, two years before Rubik invented his Cube.\n\nOn 9 April 1970, Frank Fox applied to patent an \"amusement device\", a type of [[sliding puzzle]] on a spherical surface with \"at least two 3\u00d73 arrays\" intended to be used for the game of [[noughts and crosses]].

Magic Cube was held together with interlocking plastic pieces that prevented the puzzle being easily pulled apart, unlike the magnets in Nichols's design. With Ern\u0151 Rubik's permission, businessman Tibor Laczi took a Cube to Germany's [[Nuremberg]] Toy Fair in February 1979 in an attempt to popularise it.<ref name=\"holper\">{{Cite book|last=Holper|first=Paul|title=Inventing Millions|year=2006|pages=64\u20135|publisher=Orient|isbn=8122204589}}</ref> It was noticed by Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer and they signed a deal with [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal Toys]] in September 1979 to release the Magic Cube worldwide.<ref name=\"holper\"/> Ideal wanted at least a recognisable name to trademark; of course, that arrangement put Rubik in the spotlight because the Magic Cube was renamed after its inventor in 1980.

The puzzle consists of twenty-six unique miniature cubes, also called \"cubies\" or \"cubelets\". Each of these includes a concealed inward extension that interlocks with the other cubes while permitting them to move to different locations. However, the centre cube of each of the six faces is merely a single square fa\u00e7ade; all six are affixed to the core mechanism. These provide structure for the other pieces to fit into and rotate around. So there are twenty-one pieces: a single core piece consisting of three intersecting axes holding the six centre squares in place but letting them rotate, and twenty smaller plastic pieces which fit into it to form the assembled puzzle.\n\nEach of the six centre pieces pivots on a screw (fastener) held by the centre piece, a \"3D cross\". A spring between each screw head and its corresponding piece tensions the piece inward, so that collectively, the whole assembly remains compact, but can still be easily manipulated. The screw can be tightened or loosened to change the \"feel\" of the Cube. Newer official Rubik's brand cubes have rivets instead of screws and cannot be adjusted.\n\nThe Cube can be taken apart without much difficulty, typically by rotating the top layer by 45\u00b0 and then prying one of its edge cubes away from the other two layers. Consequently, it is a simple process to \"solve\" a Cube by taking it apart and reassembling it in a solved state.\n\nThere are six central pieces which show one coloured face, twelve edge pieces which show two coloured faces, and eight corner pieces which show three coloured faces. Each piece shows a unique colour combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, if red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting an outer third of the Cube by increments of 90 degrees, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares. However, Cubes with alternative colour arrangements also exist; for example, with the yellow face opposite the green, the blue face opposite the white, and red and orange remaining opposite each other.\n\n[[Douglas Hofstadter]], in the July 1982 issue of ''Scientific American'', pointed out that Cubes could be coloured in such a way as to emphasise the corners or edges, rather than the faces as the standard colouring does; but neither of these alternative colourings has ever become popular.<ref name=\"hofstadter\"/>\n\n==Mathematics==\nThe puzzle was originally advertised as having \"over 3,000,000,000 (three [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]) combinations but only one solution\".<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTkhA3RO5fU|title=Rubik's Cube Commercial 1981|last=TELEVISIONARCHIVES|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=10 October 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>  Depending on how combinations are counted, the actual number can be significantly higher.\n\n===Permutations===\n[[File:Rubik's cube colors.svg|thumb|The current colour scheme of a Rubik's Cube]]\nThe original (3\u00d73\u00d73) Rubik's Cube has eight corners and twelve edges. There are [[factorial|8!]] (40,320) ways to arrange the corner cubes. Each corner has three possible orientations, although only seven (of eight) can be oriented independently; the orientation of the eighth (final) corner depends on the preceding seven, giving 3<sup>7</sup> (2,187) possibilities. There are 12!/2 (239,500,800) ways to arrange the edges, restricted from 12! because edges must be in an [[even permutation]] exactly when the corners are. (When arrangements of centres are also permitted, as described below, the rule is that the combined arrangement of corners, edges, and centres must be an even permutation.) Eleven edges can be flipped independently, with the flip of the twelfth depending on the preceding ones, giving 2<sup>11</sup> (2,048) possibilities.<ref>Martin Sch\u00f6nert ''[http://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Examples/rubik.html \"Analyzing Rubik's Cube with GAP\"]'': the [[permutation group]] of Rubik's Cube is examined with [[GAP computer algebra system]]</ref>\n:<math> {8! \\times 3^7 \\times (12!/2) \\times 2^{11}} = 43,252,003,274,489,856,000</math>\n\nwhich is approximately 43 [[quintillion]].<ref name=\"Vaughen\">[http://faculty.mc3.edu/cvaughen/rubikscube/cube_counting.ppt Counting the Permutations of the Rubik's Cube], Scott Vaughen.

If one considers permutations reached through disassembly of the cube, the number becomes twelve times larger:\n:<math> {8! \\times 3^8 \\times 12! \\times 2^{12}} = 519,024,039,293,878,272,000.</math>\n\nwhich is approximately 519 quintillion<ref name=\"Vaughen\"/> possible arrangements of the pieces that make up the Cube, but only one in twelve of these are actually solvable. This is because there is no sequence of moves that will swap a single pair of pieces or rotate a single corner or edge cube. Thus there are twelve possible sets of reachable configurations, sometimes called \"universes\" or \"[[orbit (group theory)|orbits]]\", into which the Cube can be placed by dismantling and reassembling it.\n\nThe preceding numbers assume the center faces are in a fixed position.  If one considers turning the whole cube to be a different permutation, then each of the preceding numbers should be multiplied by 24.  A chosen color can be on one of six sides, and then one of the adjacent colors can be in one of four positions; this determines the positions of all remaining colors.\n\n===Centre faces===\nThe original Rubik's Cube had no orientation markings on the centre faces (although some carried the words \"Rubik's Cube\" on the centre square of the white face), and therefore solving it does not require any attention to orienting those faces correctly. However, with marker pens, one could, for example, mark the central squares of an unscrambled Cube with four coloured marks on each edge, each corresponding to the colour of the adjacent face; a cube marked in this way is referred to as a \"supercube\". Some Cubes have also been produced commercially with markings on all of the squares, such as the [[Lo Shu Square|Lo Shu]] [[magic square]] or [[playing card]] [[suit (cards)|suits]]. Cubes have also been produced where the nine stickers on a face are used to make a single larger picture, and centre orientation matters on these as well. Thus one can nominally solve a Cube yet have the markings on the centres rotated; it then becomes an additional test to solve the centres as well.\n\nMarking the Rubik's Cube's centres increases its difficulty because this expands the set of distinguishable possible configurations. There are 4<sup>6</sup>/2 (2,048) ways to orient the centres since an even permutation of the corners implies an even number of quarter turns of centres as well. In particular, when the Cube is unscrambled apart from the orientations of the central squares, there will always be an even number of centre squares requiring a quarter turn. Thus orientations of centres increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (4.3\u00d710<sup>19</sup>) to 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9\u00d710<sup>22</sup>).<ref>''Scientific American'', p28, '''vol 246''', 1982 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vDo7AAAAMAAJ&q=orientations+of+face+centers+matter&dq=orientations+of+face+centers+matter&lr=&pgis=1 retrieved online] 29 January 2009.</ref>\n\nWhen turning a cube over is considered to be a change in permutation then we must also count arrangements of the centre faces. Nominally there are 6! ways to arrange the six centre faces of the cube, but only 24 of these are achievable without disassembly of the cube. When the orientations of centres are also counted, as above, this increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9\u00d710<sup>22</sup>) to 2,125,922,464,947,725,402,112,000 (2.1\u00d710<sup>24</sup>).\n\n===Algorithms===\nIn Rubik's cubers' parlance, a memorised sequence of moves that has a desired effect on the cube is called an algorithm. This terminology is derived from the mathematical use of ''[[algorithm]]'', meaning a list of well-defined instructions for performing a task from a given initial state, through well-defined successive states, to a desired end-state. Each method of solving the Rubik's Cube employs its own set of algorithms, together with descriptions of what effect the algorithm has, and when it can be used to bring the cube closer to being solved.\n\nMany algorithms are designed to transform only a small part of the cube without interfering with other parts that have already been solved so that they can be applied repeatedly to different parts of the cube until the whole is solved. For example, there are well-known algorithms for cycling three corners without changing the rest of the puzzle or flipping the orientation of a pair of edges while leaving the others intact.\n\nSome algorithms do have a certain desired effect on the cube (for example, swapping two corners) but may also have the side-effect of changing other parts of the cube (such as permuting some edges). Such algorithms are often simpler than the ones without side-effects and are employed early on in the solution when most of the puzzle has not yet been solved and the side-effects are not important. Most are long and difficult to memorise. Towards the end of the solution, the more specific (and usually more complicated) algorithms are used instead.\n\n===Relevance and application of mathematical group theory===\nRubik's Cube lends itself to the application of [[Rubik's Cube group|mathematical group theory]], which has been helpful for deducing certain algorithms \u2013 in particular, those which have a ''[[commutator]]'' structure, namely ''XYX''<sup>\u22121</sup>''Y''<sup>\u22121</sup> (where ''X'' and ''Y'' are specific moves or move-sequences and ''X''<sup>\u22121</sup> and ''Y''<sup>\u22121</sup> are their respective inverses), or a ''[[Conjugation (group theory)|conjugate]]'' structure, namely ''XYX''<sup>\u22121</sup>, often referred to by speedcubers colloquially as a \"setup move\".<ref name=\"Singmaster\"/> In addition, the fact that there are well-defined [[subgroup]]s within the [[Rubik's Cube group]] enables the puzzle to be learned and mastered by moving up through various self-contained \"levels of difficulty\". For example, one such \"level\" could involve solving cubes which have been scrambled using only 180-degree turns. These subgroups are the principle underlying the computer cubing methods by [[Morwen Thistlethwaite#Thistlethwaite's algorithm|Thistlethwaite]] and [[Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube#Kociemba's algorithm|Kociemba]], which solve the cube by further reducing it to another subgroup.\n\n==Solutions==\n===Move notation===\nMany 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube enthusiasts use a notation developed by [[David Singmaster]] to denote a sequence of moves, referred to as \"Singmaster notation\".<ref name=\"advgroup\">{{Cite book |author=Joyner, David |title=Adventures in group theory: Rubik's Cube, Merlin's machine, and Other Mathematical Toys |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2002 |page=[https://archive.org/details/adventuresingrou0000joyn/page/7 7] |isbn=0-8018-6947-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/adventuresingrou0000joyn/page/7 }}</ref> Its relative nature allows [[algorithms]] to be written in such a way that they can be applied regardless of which side is designated the top or how the colours are organised on a particular cube.\n* ''F'' (Front): the side currently facing the solver\n* ''B'' (Back): the side opposite the front\n* ''U'' (Up): the side above or on top of the front side\n* ''D'' (Down): the side opposite the top, underneath the Cube\n* ''L'' (Left): the side directly to the left of the front\n* ''R'' (Right): the side directly to the right of the front\n* ''\u0192'' (Front two layers): the side facing the solver and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''b'' (Back two layers): the side opposite the front and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''u'' (Up two layers): the top side and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''d'' (Down two layers): the bottom layer and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''l'' (Left two layers): the side to the left of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''r'' (Right two layers): the side to the right of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''x'' (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on ''R''\n* ''y'' (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on ''U''\n* ''z'' (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on ''F''\n\nWhen a [[Prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] (&nbsp;\u2032&nbsp;) follows a letter, it denotes an anticlockwise face turn; while a letter without a prime symbol denotes a clockwise turn. These directions are as one is looking at the specified face.  A letter followed by a&nbsp;2 (occasionally a superscript&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>) denotes two turns, or a 180-degree turn. ''R'' is right side clockwise, but ''R\u2032'' is right side anticlockwise. The letters ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are used to indicate that the entire Cube should be turned about one of its axes, corresponding to R, U, and F turns respectively. When ''x'', ''y'', or ''z'' are primed, it is an indication that the cube must be rotated in the opposite direction. When they are squared, the cube must be rotated 180 degrees. <!-- Which axis (x, y, z) is which? user Nikevich -->\n\nThe most common deviation from Singmaster notation, and in fact the current official standard, is to use \"w\", for \"wide\", instead of lowercase letters to represent moves of two layers; thus, a move of ''Rw'' is equivalent to one of ''r''.<ref name=wcarules>{{cite web|title=World Cube Association Competition Regulations|url=http://worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor methods using middle-layer turns (particularly corners-first methods), there is a generally accepted \"MES\" extension to the notation where letters ''M'', ''E'', and ''S'' denote middle layer turns. It was used e.g. in Marc Waterman's Algorithm.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Treep |first1=Anneke |last2=Waterman |first2=Marc |title=Marc Waterman's Algorithm, Part 2 |series=Cubism For Fun 15 |year=1987 |publisher=Nederlandse Kubus Club |page=10}}</ref>\n* ''M'' (Middle): the layer between L and R, turn direction as L (top-down)\n* ''E'' (Equator): the layer between U and D, turn direction as D (left-right)\n* ''S'' (Standing): the layer between F and B, turn direction as F\n\nThe 4\u00d74\u00d74 and larger cubes use an extended notation to refer to the additional middle layers. Generally speaking, uppercase letters (''F B U D L R'') refer to the outermost portions of the cube (called faces). Lowercase letters (''f b u d l r'') refer to the inner portions of the cube (called slices). An asterisk (L*), a number in front of it (2L), or two layers in parentheses (Ll), means to turn the two layers at the same time (both the inner and the outer left faces) For example: (''Rr'')<nowiki>'</nowiki>&nbsp;''l''2&nbsp;''f''<nowiki>'</nowiki> means to turn the two rightmost layers anticlockwise, then the left inner layer twice, and then the inner front layer anticlockwise. By extension, for cubes of 6\u00d76\u00d76 and larger, moves of three layers are notated by the number 3, for example, 3L.\n\nAn alternative notation, Wolstenholme notation,<ref>http://www.topaccolades.com/notation/rubikscube.htm Wolstenholme notation</ref> is designed to make memorising sequences of moves easier for novices.  This notation uses the same letters for faces except it replaces U with T (top), so that all are consonants.  The key difference is the use of the vowels O, A, and I for cl'''o'''ckwise, '''a'''nticlockwise, and tw'''i'''ce (180-degree) turns, which results in word-like sequences such as LOTA RATO LATA ROTI (equivalent to LU\u2032R\u2032UL\u2032U\u2032RU2 in Singmaster notation). Addition of a C implies rotation of the entire cube, so ROC is the clockwise rotation of the cube around its right face. Middle layer moves are denoted by adding an M to corresponding face move, so RIM means a 180-degree turn of the middle layer adjacent to the R face.\n\nAnother notation appeared in the 1981 book ''[[The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube]]''. Singmaster notation was not widely known at the time of publication. The faces were named Top (T), Bottom (B), Left (L), Right (R), Front (F), and Posterior (P), with + for clockwise, \u2013 for anticlockwise, and 2 for 180-degree turns.\n\nAnother notation appeared in the 1982 \"The Ideal Solution\" book for Rubik's Revenge. Horizontal planes were noted as tables, with table 1 or T1 starting at the top. Vertical front to back planes were noted as books, with book 1 or B1 starting from the left. Vertical left to right planes were noted as windows, with window 1 or W1 starting at the front. Using the front face as a reference view, table moves were left or right, book moves were up or down, and window moves were clockwise or anticlockwise.\n\n===Optimal solutions===\n{{Main|Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube}}\n[[File:1982 expedition to Tartu \u00dclikool 350 (23).jpg|thumb|[[Mountaineering|Mountaineer]] solving Rubik's Cube during 1982 expedition in [[Pamir Mountains]] to peak [[Tartu \u00dclikool 350]]]]\n\nAlthough there are a significant number of possible permutations for the Rubik's Cube, a number of solutions have been developed which allow solving the cube in well under 100 moves.\n\nMany general solutions for the Rubik's Cube have been discovered independently.

After sufficient practice, solving the Cube layer by layer can be done in under one minute. Other general solutions include \"corners first\" methods or combinations of several other methods. In 1982, David Singmaster and Alexander Frey hypothesised that the number of moves needed to solve the Rubik's Cube, given an ideal algorithm, might be in \"the low twenties\".<ref>{{cite book|title= Handbook of Cubik Math|last= Frey, Jr.|first= Alexander H.|author2= Singmaster, David|year= 1982|publisher= Enslow Publishers|location= Hillside, N.J|isbn= 0-89490-058-7|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/handbookofcubikm0000frey}}</ref> In 2007, Daniel Kunkle and Gene Cooperman used computer search methods to demonstrate that any 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube configuration can be solved in 26 moves or fewer.<ref name=D.Kunkle>{{cite conference\n | first = D.\n | last = Kunkle\n | author2 = Cooperman, C.\n | title = Twenty-Six Moves Suffice for Rubik's Cube\n | booktitle = Proceedings of the International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC '07)\n | year = 2007\n | publisher = ACM Press\n | url = http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gene/papers/rubik.pdf\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference\n | last = KFC\n | title = Rubik's cube proof cut to 25 moves\n | year = 2008\n | url = http://arxivblog.com/?p=332\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://blog.sciencenews.org/mathtrek/2007/08/cracking_the_cube.html\n|title=Cracking the Cube\n|author=Julie J.

This method is called [[CFOP]] standing for \"cross, F2L, OLL, PLL\".  It is similar to the layer-by-layer method but employs the use of a large number of algorithms, especially for orienting and permuting the last layer. The cross is done first, followed by first layer corners and second layer edges simultaneously, with each corner paired up with a second-layer edge piece, thus completing the first two layers (F2L). This is then followed by [[Orientation (geometry)|orienting]] the last layer, then [[permutation|permuting]] the last layer (OLL and PLL respectively). [[Fridrich Method|Fridrich's solution]] requires learning roughly 120 algorithms but allows the Cube to be solved in only 55 moves on average.\n\nA now well-known method was developed by [[Lars Petrus]]. In this method, a 2\u00d72\u00d72 section is solved first, followed by a 2\u00d72\u00d73, and then the incorrect edges are solved using a three-move algorithm, which eliminates the need for a possible 32-move algorithm later. The principle behind this is that in layer-by-layer, one must constantly break and fix the completed layer(s); the 2\u00d72\u00d72 and 2\u00d72\u00d73 sections allow three or two layers (respectively) to be turned without ruining progress. One of the advantages of this method is that it tends to give solutions in fewer moves. For this reason, the method is also popular for fewest move competitions.<ref name=larspatrus>{{cite web|url=https://lar5.com/cube/ |title=Rubik's Cube Solution - Petrus Method |publisher=lar5.com |accessdate=8 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Roux Method, developed by [[Gilles Roux]], is similar to the Petrus method in that it relies on block building rather than layers, but derives from corners-first methods. In Roux, a 3\u00d72\u00d71 block is solved, followed by another 3\u00d72\u00d71 on the opposite side. Next, the corners of the top layer are solved. The cube can then be solved using only moves of the U layer and M slice.<ref name=rouxmeth>{{cite web|url=http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html |title=Introduction |publisher=Grrroux.free.fr |accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Beginners' methods===\nMost beginner solution methods involve solving the cube one layer at a time, using algorithms that preserve what has already been solved.

The mechanical products include the Rubik's Magic, 360, and Twist. Also, electronics like the Rubik's Revolution and Slide were also inspired by the original.  One of the newest 3\u00d73\u00d73 Cube variants is the Rubik's TouchCube. Sliding a finger across its faces causes its patterns of coloured lights to rotate the same way they would on a mechanical cube. The TouchCube also has buttons for hints and self-solving, and it includes a charging stand. The TouchCube was introduced at the [[American International Toy Fair]] in New York on 15 February 2009.<ref name=\"reutersny\">{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUKN1546558020090216?sp=true |title=NY Toy Fair opens with new Rubik's Cube, Lego deals|accessdate=23 March 2009 | agency=Reuters | date=16 February 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"ny1elec\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ny1.com/Content/Top_Stories/93988/toy-fair-kicks-off-at-javits-center/Default.aspx|title=Toy Fair Kicks Off at Javits Center|accessdate=23 March 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422104222/http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/93988/toy-fair-kicks-off-at-javits-center/Default.aspx|archivedate=22 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe Cube has inspired an entire category of similar puzzles, commonly referred to as ''[[Combination puzzles|twisty puzzles]]'', which includes the cubes of different sizes mentioned above as well as various other geometric shapes. Some such shapes include the [[tetrahedron]] ([[Pyraminx]]), the [[octahedron]] ([[Skewb Diamond]]), the [[dodecahedron]] ([[Megaminx]]), and the [[icosahedron]] ([[Dogic]]). There are also puzzles that change shape such as [[Rubik's Snake]] and the [[Square One (puzzle)|Square One]].\n\nIn 2011, [[Guinness World Records]] awarded the \"largest order Rubiks magic cube\" to a 17\u00d717\u00d717 cube, made by [[Oskar van Deventer]].<ref name=\"largestguinness\">{{cite web |title=Largest Order Rubiks / Magic Cube |work=Guinness World Records |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/11000/largest-order-rubiks-magic-cube |accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=van Deventer|first=Oskar|title=Over the Top \u2013 17x17x17|url=http://www.shapeways.com/model/64058/over-the-top-17x17x17.html}}</ref> On 2 December 2017, [[Gr\u00e9goire Pfennig]] announced that he had broken this record, with a 33\u00d733\u00d733 cube, and that his claim had been submitted to Guinness for verification.<ref name=\"cube33\"/> On 8 April 2018, Gr\u00e9goire Pfennig announced another world record, the 2x2x50 cube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIP3lmQHXg|title=World Record 2x2x50 Rubik's Cube !!! :D|last=Greg's Puzzles|date=8 April 2018|accessdate=13 April 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> Whether this is a replacement for the 33x33x33 record, or an additional record, remains to be seen.\n\n[[File:Rubiks Platonic Solids.jpg|thumb|All five platonic solids represented by twisty puzzles]]\n\nSome puzzles have also been created in the shape of the [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]], such as [[Alexander's Star]] (a [[great dodecahedron]]). Gr\u00e9goire Pfennig has also created at least one puzzle in the shape of a [[small stellated dodecahedron]].\n\n===Custom-built puzzles===\n[[File:Novelty Keychain Rubiks Cube.JPG|thumb|Novelty keychain]]\n\nPuzzles have been built resembling the Rubik's Cube or based on its inner workings. For example, a cuboid is a puzzle based on the Rubik's Cube, but with different functional dimensions, such as 2\u00d72\u00d74, 2\u00d73\u00d74, and 3\u00d73\u00d75.<ref>Martin, W. Eric. \"Gamebits: Rubik's Cube... Cubed\". ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]''. Issue 199 (Vol. 28 No. 3). p. 4. April 2004.</ref> Many cuboids are based on 4\u00d74\u00d74 or 5\u00d75\u00d75 mechanisms, via building plastic extensions or by directly modifying the mechanism itself.\n\nSome custom puzzles are not derived from any existing mechanism, such as the Gigaminx v1.5-v2, Bevel Cube, SuperX, Toru, Rua, and 1\u00d72\u00d73. These puzzles usually have a set of masters 3D printed, which then are copied using moulding and casting techniques to create the final puzzle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nOther Rubik's Cube modifications include cubes that have been extended or truncated to form a new shape. An example of this is the Trabjer's Octahedron, which can be built by truncating and extending portions of a regular 3\u00d73\u00d73. Most shape mods can be adapted to higher-order cubes. In the case of [[Tony Fisher (puzzle designer)|Tony Fisher's]] Rhombic Dodecahedron, there are 3\u00d73\u00d73, 4\u00d74\u00d74, 5\u00d75\u00d75, and 6\u00d76\u00d76 versions of the puzzle.\n\n=== Rubik's Cube software ===\n[[Puzzle]]s like the Rubik's Cube can be simulated by [[computer software]], which provides functions such as recording of player metrics, storing scrambled Cube positions, conducting online competitions, analysing of move sequences, and converting between different move [[notation]]s.

Its traditional [[campus]], located in the center of Athens on [[Patision Avenue]], features a suite of magnificent neo-[[classical architecture|classical]] buildings by architect Lysandros Kaftantzoglou (1811\u20131885). A new campus, the [[Zografou]] Campus, was built in the 1980s.<ref name=\"NTUA History\" />\n\nNTUA is divided into nine academic schools, eight being for the [[engineering]] disciplines, including [[architecture]], and one for applied [[sciences]] (mathematics and physics). Undergraduate studies have a duration of five years. Admission to NTUA is highly selective and can only be accomplished through achieving exceptional grades in the annual [[Panhellenic Examinations|Panhellenic Exams]]. It is a widely spread perception that the vast majority of each year's Panhellenic Exams top students interested in the sciences and technology opts to attend NTUA. The university comprises about 700 of academic staff, 140 scientific assistants and 260 administrative and technical staff. It also has about 8,500 undergraduates and about 1,500 postgraduate students.<ref name=\"NTUA Schools\" /> Eight of the NTUA's Schools are housed at the Zografou Campus, while the School of Architecture is based at the Patision Complex.\n\n==History==\nNTUA was established by [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|royal]] decree on December 31, 1836 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|(OS)]], January 21, 1837 (NS), under the name  \"Royal School of Arts\" (\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03a4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd).<ref name=\"Ntua History Greek\" /> It began functioning as a part-time vocational school (only Sundays and holidays) to train craftsmen, builders and master craftsmen to cover the needs of the [[History of modern Greece|new Greek state]]. In 1840, due to its increasing popularity and the changing socio-economic conditions in the new state, NTUA was upgraded to a daily technical school which worked along with the Sunday school. The courses were expanded and the institution was housed in its own building in [[Pireos Street]].<ref name=\"Ntua History Greek\" />\n\n===The restructuring===\nIn 1843 a major restructuring was made. Three departments were created:\n\n* ''Part-Time Vocational School''\n* ''Daily School''\n* A new ''Higher School of Fine Arts''\n\nThe new department's object was fine arts and engineering. The new department, which was later renamed ''School of Industrial and Fine Arts'', rapidly evolved towards a major higher education institution. Tradition has it that ''arts'' referred to both technical professions and fine arts. Even today, the school maintains a school of architecture that is closely related to the School of Fine Arts, which later evolved to become a separate school.\n\nThe name ''Polytechnnic'' came in 1862, with the introduction of several new technical courses. This restructuring continued steadily until 1873. At the time, the school became overwhelmed by the plethora of students wanting to learn high technical skills, and this led to its moving to a new campus.\n\n===The relocation===\n[[File:NTUA - Patision Complex.jpg|right|thumb|340px|The historical Patision Street campus in a postcard of 1900.]]\n[[File:NTUA Averof Building Main Facade.jpg|thumb|240px|The main facade of the Averof building today.]]\n\nIn 1873 it moved to its new campus in [[Patision Street]] and was known as ''Metsovion Polytechnion'' (Metsovian Polytechnic) after the birthplace of its benefactors who financed the construction of this campus. At the time, the campus in Patision Street was even partially incomplete, but the high demand by students made it urgent to rellocate.\n\nIn 1887, the institution was partitioned into three schools of technical orientation, the schools of Structural Engineering, Architecture and Mechanical Engineering, all four-year degrees at the time. This is when the institute was recognized as a technical education facility by the state, which was a crucial step for its development, as it became accompanied to the country's needs as it developed.\n\nIn 1914, new schools were created and was officially named ''Ethnicon Metsovion Polytechnion'' (National Metsovian Polytechnic) went under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Works. This is when new technical schools started to be formed, a procedure was completed three years later, in 1917 when the NTUA changed form: By special law, the old ''School of Industrial Arts'' was now separated into the Higher Schools of ''Civil Engineering'', ''Mechanical&nbsp;&amp; Electrical Engineering'', ''Chemical Engineering'', ''Surveying Engineering'' and ''Architecture''. Later, the schools of ''Naval Engineering'', and ''Mining and Metallurgical Engineering'' were formed, and the school of ''Mechanical&nbsp;&amp; Electrical Engineering'' was split up into two separate schools, ''Mechanical Engineering'' and ''Electrical and Computer Engineering'', which is almost the form of schools maintained until now.\n\nIn 1923, the NTUA alumni formed the core of the [[Technical Chamber of Greece]], the professional organization that serves as the official technical adviser of the [[Greek state]] and is responsible for awarding professional licenses to all practicing engineers in Greece.<ref name=\"NTUA History\" />\n\nIn 1930, the [[Athens School of Fine Arts]] was established, acquiring its independence from the NTUA, as a school exclusively focused in the teaching the fine arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asfa.gr/greek/ASKT/info/info01.htm|date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=2010-09-20|title=\u0391\u03bd\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7 \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd \u03a4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd&nbsp;\u2013 \u038a\u03b4\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c2}}</ref> This allowed the two schools to develop separately as a technical and an arts school respectively.\n\nIn 1941 to 1944, the National Technical University of Athens played an important role in the country's political life with the Greek students participating in the [[Greek Resistance|National Resistance]] under the German occupation. During the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation of Greece]], NTUA, in addition to its function as an academic institution, became one of the most active [[Greek Resistance#Resistance in the cities|resistance]] centers in Athens.\n\n===The uprising===\n{{main|Athens Polytechnic uprising}}\nThe most important event of NTUA's history is the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] on November 17, 1973, which was the first step to overthrow [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Greece's military dictatorship]].\nOn 14, 15 and 16 of November 1973, the students were barricaded inside the institute, and started broadcasting a pirate radio transmission, calling the people of Athens to rebel. In the evening of November 17 however, an AMX-30 class military tank broke the main gate and charged inside, after receiving orders from the dictators. About 23 people were killed in the following events and the uprising ended. The junta however, was irreparably damaged by the popular outcry. The junta fell in 1974, after the Turkish invasion in Cyprus and since then, November 17 is celebrated as a day of freedom and democracy. All schools and universities of the country remain closed on that day.<ref name=\"NTUA History\" />\n\n==Emblem==\nThe emblem of the National Technical University of Athens is

It constitutes also one of the most important creations of European [[Neoclassicism]], directly influenced in its design by the monuments of the Athenian [[Acropolis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europanostra.org/awards/69/|title=Europa Nostra - The conservation project of the Averof Building|accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref> Its construction began in 1862 and ended in 1878. After its completion, the building was in continuous use for more than 125 years during which it suffered from several additions and alterations. The main building has housed at times the [[National Gallery (Athens)|National Gallery]] and various exhibitions of [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]]'s archaeological findings and relics of the 1821 [[Greek revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.ntua.gr/page/28|title=NTUA Architecture School - The Averof Building|accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe Averof building reached a deteriorating state and was eventually in great need of restoration and modernization in order to continue operating as an educational establishment. The aim of the conservation project, namely for the Averof to be used again as an educational building, was successfully achieved after the building became operative in the beginning of 2010 and won the grand prize of [[Europa Nostra]] in 2012.\n\n\n===Zografou Campus===\n[[File:Attica 06-13 Hills of Hymettus 15 view.jpg|right|thumb|260px|View of the Zografou campus from Kalogeros hill]]\nThe main campus is located in the [[Zografou]] area of [[Athens]], housing all the schools of NTUA except architecture, which remains in its traditional location on the [[Patision Avenue]] for historical reasons.

Right next to it is the Mining and Metallurgical Engineering School. The Civil Engineering School and the Rural and Surveying Engineering School are both housed on the south-west near the Zografou Gate. Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Naval Engineering, and the new Electrical Engineering School are all housed near the middle of the campus, while the old electrical engineering buildings remain on the north-east.\n\n====Transportation====\nThere are in-campus roads making all buildings accessible by bicycle and car. There are also various internal buses that allow for transportation within the facilities, driving around the perimeter of the campus and through eight different bus stops. The campus is accessible through three main gates: the [[Katechaki Avenue|Katechaki]] and Kokkinopoulou Gates on the north, and the Zografou Gate on the west. There are 2,000 dedicated parking spots scattered throughout the campus, most nearby all major buildings. The campus resides near the [[Katehaki station|metro station of Katechaki]], which makes it accessible within minutes from any area of Athens. Furthermore, six different buses are available for transportation from various city locations to the campus: the 608 from [[Galatsi]], 230 from [[Acropolis]], 242 from the Katechaki Metro station and 140 from [[Glifada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntua.gr/visit.html|accessdate=2010-09-21|publisher=NTUA|title=Transportation at NTUA|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716094615/http://www.ntua.gr/visit.html|archivedate=2011-07-16}}</ref>\n\n====Central Library====\n[[File:Ntua library.jpg|thumb|Central Library of National Technical University of Athens]]\nOn the campus lies the NTUA Central [[Library]], which has operated since 1914, and was the first library in [[Greece]] with a complete index.

Its traditional [[campus]], located in the center of Athens on [[Patision Avenue]], features a suite of magnificent neo-[[classical architecture|classical]] buildings by architect Lysandros Kaftantzoglou (1811\u20131885). A new campus, the [[Zografou]] Campus, was built in the 1980s.<ref name=\"NTUA History\" />\n\nNTUA is divided into nine academic schools, eight being for the [[engineering]] disciplines, including [[architecture]], and one for applied [[sciences]] (mathematics and physics). Undergraduate studies have a duration of five years. Admission to NTUA is highly selective and can only be accomplished through achieving exceptional grades in the annual [[Panhellenic Examinations|Panhellenic Exams]]. It is a widely spread perception that the vast majority of each year's Panhellenic Exams top students interested in the sciences and technology opts to attend NTUA. The university comprises about 700 of academic staff, 140 scientific assistants and 260 administrative and technical staff. It also has about 8,500 undergraduates and about 1,500 postgraduate students.<ref name=\"NTUA Schools\" /> Eight of the NTUA's Schools are housed at the Zografou Campus, while the School of Architecture is based at the Patision Complex.\n\n==History==\nNTUA was established by [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|royal]] decree on December 31, 1836 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|(OS)]], January 21, 1837 (NS), under the name  \"Royal School of Arts\" (\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03a4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd).<ref name=\"Ntua History Greek\" /> It began functioning as a part-time vocational school (only Sundays and holidays) to train craftsmen, builders and master craftsmen to cover the needs of the [[History of modern Greece|new Greek state]]. In 1840, due to its increasing popularity and the changing socio-economic conditions in the new state, NTUA was upgraded to a daily technical school which worked along with the Sunday school. The courses were expanded and the institution was housed in its own building in [[Pireos Street]].<ref name=\"Ntua History Greek\" />\n\n===The restructuring===\nIn 1843 a major restructuring was made. Three departments were created:\n\n* ''Part-Time Vocational School''\n* ''Daily School''\n* A new ''Higher School of Fine Arts''\n\nThe new department's object was fine arts and engineering. The new department, which was later renamed ''School of Industrial and Fine Arts'', rapidly evolved towards a major higher education institution. Tradition has it that ''arts'' referred to both technical professions and fine arts. Even today, the school maintains a school of architecture that is closely related to the School of Fine Arts, which later evolved to become a separate school.\n\nThe name ''Polytechnnic'' came in 1862, with the introduction of several new technical courses. This restructuring continued steadily until 1873. At the time, the school became overwhelmed by the plethora of students wanting to learn high technical skills, and this led to its moving to a new campus.\n\n===The relocation===\n[[File:NTUA - Patision Complex.jpg|right|thumb|340px|The historical Patision Street campus in a postcard of 1900.]]\n[[File:NTUA Averof Building Main Facade.jpg|thumb|240px|The main facade of the Averof building today.]]\n\nIn 1873 it moved to its new campus in [[Patision Street]] and was known as ''Metsovion Polytechnion'' (Metsovian Polytechnic) after the birthplace of its benefactors who financed the construction of this campus. At the time, the campus in Patision Street was even partially incomplete, but the high demand by students made it urgent to rellocate.\n\nIn 1887, the institution was partitioned into three schools of technical orientation, the schools of Structural Engineering, Architecture and Mechanical Engineering, all four-year degrees at the time. This is when the institute was recognized as a technical education facility by the state, which was a crucial step for its development, as it became accompanied to the country's needs as it developed.\n\nIn 1914, new schools were created and was officially named ''Ethnicon Metsovion Polytechnion'' (National Metsovian Polytechnic) went under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Works. This is when new technical schools started to be formed, a procedure was completed three years later, in 1917 when the NTUA changed form: By special law, the old ''School of Industrial Arts'' was now separated into the Higher Schools of ''Civil Engineering'', ''Mechanical&nbsp;&amp; Electrical Engineering'', ''Chemical Engineering'', ''Surveying Engineering'' and ''Architecture''. Later, the schools of ''Naval Engineering'', and ''Mining and Metallurgical Engineering'' were formed, and the school of ''Mechanical&nbsp;&amp; Electrical Engineering'' was split up into two separate schools, ''Mechanical Engineering'' and ''Electrical and Computer Engineering'', which is almost the form of schools maintained until now.\n\nIn 1923, the NTUA alumni formed the core of the [[Technical Chamber of Greece]], the professional organization that serves as the official technical adviser of the [[Greek state]] and is responsible for awarding professional licenses to all practicing engineers in Greece.<ref name=\"NTUA History\" />\n\nIn 1930, the [[Athens School of Fine Arts]] was established, acquiring its independence from the NTUA, as a school exclusively focused in the teaching the fine arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asfa.gr/greek/ASKT/info/info01.htm|date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=2010-09-20|title=\u0391\u03bd\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7 \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd \u03a4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd&nbsp;\u2013 \u038a\u03b4\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c2}}</ref> This allowed the two schools to develop separately as a technical and an arts school respectively.\n\nIn 1941 to 1944, the National Technical University of Athens played an important role in the country's political life with the Greek students participating in the [[Greek Resistance|National Resistance]] under the German occupation. During the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation of Greece]], NTUA, in addition to its function as an academic institution, became one of the most active [[Greek Resistance#Resistance in the cities|resistance]] centers in Athens.\n\n===The uprising===\n{{main|Athens Polytechnic uprising}}\nThe most important event of NTUA's history is the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] on November 17, 1973, which was the first step to overthrow [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Greece's military dictatorship]].\nOn 14, 15 and 16 of November 1973, the students were barricaded inside the institute, and started broadcasting a pirate radio transmission, calling the people of Athens to rebel. In the evening of November 17 however, an AMX-30 class military tank broke the main gate and charged inside, after receiving orders from the dictators. About 23 people were killed in the following events and the uprising ended. The junta however, was irreparably damaged by the popular outcry. The junta fell in 1974, after the Turkish invasion in Cyprus and since then, November 17 is celebrated as a day of freedom and democracy. All schools and universities of the country remain closed on that day.<ref name=\"NTUA History\" />\n\n==Emblem==\nThe emblem of the National Technical University of Athens is

The diploma thesis has to be related to one of the courses of the faculty. The student has at his or her disposal at least a full academic semester to prepare the thesis. Upon completion of the thesis, the student must take part in an oral examination that can take place either in June, October or February, after the final examinations, provided that the student has passed all courses prescribed by the curriculum.\n\nAn important part of the studies in NTUA are the summer \"training\" projects which take place in Industrial and Production Units, in the period between the end of the spring semester and the beginning of the fall semester. They constitute an elective course for the Faculties of Civil Engineering, Survey Engineering (Surveying and Geodesy Camp) and Mining and Metallurgy Engineering (Mining Camp) and are partially subsidized by the European Union.\n\n====Postgraduate studies====\nThere are currently 20<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntua.gr/el/school/postgraduate-studies|script-title=el:\u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03ad\u03c2|last=George|website=www.ntua.gr|language=el-gr|access-date=2018-07-01}}</ref> departmental or inter-departmental postgraduate courses, coordinated by NTUA Departments, leading to the respective Post Graduate Specialization Diploma, with a minimum duration of 17 months, including one in Business Administration<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://athensmba.ntua.gr/|title=Athens MBA|website=http://athensmba.ntua.gr/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725161742/http://athensmba.ntua.gr/|archive-date=2010-07-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> (in collaboration with the Athens University of Economics and Business).

It constitutes also one of the most important creations of European [[Neoclassicism]], directly influenced in its design by the monuments of the Athenian [[Acropolis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europanostra.org/awards/69/|title=Europa Nostra - The conservation project of the Averof Building|accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref> Its construction began in 1862 and ended in 1878. After its completion, the building was in continuous use for more than 125 years during which it suffered from several additions and alterations. The main building has housed at times the [[National Gallery (Athens)|National Gallery]] and various exhibitions of [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]]'s archaeological findings and relics of the 1821 [[Greek revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.ntua.gr/page/28|title=NTUA Architecture School - The Averof Building|accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe Averof building reached a deteriorating state and was eventually in great need of restoration and modernization in order to continue operating as an educational establishment. The aim of the conservation project, namely for the Averof to be used again as an educational building, was successfully achieved after the building became operative in the beginning of 2010 and won the grand prize of [[Europa Nostra]] in 2012.\n\n\n===Zografou Campus===\n[[File:Attica 06-13 Hills of Hymettus 15 view.jpg|right|thumb|260px|View of the Zografou campus from Kalogeros hill]]\nThe main campus is located in the [[Zografou]] area of [[Athens]], housing all the schools of NTUA except architecture, which remains in its traditional location on the [[Patision Avenue]] for historical reasons.
