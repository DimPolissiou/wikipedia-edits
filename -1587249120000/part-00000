His father, [[Cumhall]], a warrior in Conn's service, was a suitor of [[Muirne]], daughter of the druid [[Tadg mac Nuadat]], but Tadg refused his suit, so Cumhall abducted her. Conn went to war against him, and Cumhall was killed by [[Goll mac Morna]] in the Battle of Cnucha. But Muirne was already pregnant, and Tadg rejected her, ordering her to be burned. She fled to Conn, and Conn put her under the protection of Cumhall's brother-in-law Fiacal mac Conchinn. It was in Fiacal's house that she gave birth to a son, Deimne, who was later renamed Fionn.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/f01.html \"The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha\"], [[Tom Peete Cross]] & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co, 1936, pp. 357\u2013359</ref> When he was ten, Fionn came to Tara put himself into Conn's service. He learned that every year at [[Samhain]], the monster [[Aillen]] would put everyone at Tara to sleep with his music, and burn down the palace with his fiery breath.

Connla fell in love with a fairy woman from [[Mag Mell]], and went with her to her otherworld home in her crystal boat, leaving Art alone.

She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her [[currach]], but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother. She told Conn that the famine would end if he would put B\u00e9 Chuille away, but he refused. B\u00e9 Chuille was later banished from Tara as the result of a series of challenges she and Art made each other over a game of ''[[fidchell]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/art.html \"The Adventures of Art son of Conn\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 491\u2013502</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nConn was eventually killed by [[Tipraite T\u00edrech]], king of the [[Ulaid]], on Tuesday 20 October according to [[Ruaidhr\u00ed \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh]] in his 'Ogygia: seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia' (1685).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/ogygiaorchronolo02oflaiala/page/214/mode/2up/search/conn+]</ref> The ''Lebor Gab\u00e1la'',<ref>[https://archive.org/details/leborgablare00macauoft/page/332/mode/2up]</ref> Baile in Sc\u00e1il,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lecturesonmanusc00ocuruoft/page/620/mode/2up]</ref> Gilla C\u00f3em\u00e1in's poem \"Annalad annall uile\"<ref>[http://elverdissen.dyndns.org/~nodus/618-POEMS.pdf]</ref> and the ''Annals''<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Gb0_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=%22T%C3%BAath+Amrois%22&source=bl&ots=PWyXzakIhg&sig=ACfU3U05_iImxpyz0e1xT69Ju-4suVrh-g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJ85yT0_DoAhX1tHEKHWffDt0Q6AEwA3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22T%C3%BAath%20Amrois%22&f=false]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/annalsoftigernac00stokuoft/page/8/mode/2up]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LY9nAAAAMAAJ&q=%22tuath+ambrois%22&dq=%22tuath+ambrois%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiq_e695PDoAhUOTBUIHed5DhwQ6AEIQjAD]</ref> say Tipraite defeated him in battle in T\u00faath Amrois.

Aonghus flees to Conn, who gives him an army with which to reclaim his kingdom, but Mug Nuadat defeats this and a further nine attempts by Conn to drive him out of Munster, forcing Conn to divide Ireland with him. When hostilities break out again, Conn and Mug Nuadat's armies gather for battle at Mag Leana, but Conn kills Mug Nuadat in his bed in an early morning attack.<ref>[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text050.html 1.40]</ref>\n\nAccording to a medieval source, the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] was born in Conn's time. His father, [[Cumhall]], a warrior in Conn's service, was a suitor of [[Muirne]], daughter of the druid [[Tadg mac Nuadat]], but Tadg refused his suit, so Cumhall abducted her. Conn went to war against him, and Cumhall was killed by [[Goll mac Morna]] in the Battle of Cnucha. But Muirne was already pregnant, and Tadg rejected her, ordering her to be burned. She fled to Conn, and Conn put her under the protection of Cumhall's brother-in-law Fiacal mac Conchinn. It was in Fiacal's house that she gave birth to a son, Deimne, who was later renamed Fionn.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/f01.html \"The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha\"], [[Tom Peete Cross]] & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co, 1936, pp. 357\u2013359</ref> When he was ten, Fionn came to Tara put himself into Conn's service. He learned that every year at [[Samhain]], the monster [[Aillen]] would put everyone at Tara to sleep with his music, and burn down the palace with his fiery breath. Fionn killed Aillen, having kept himself awake by pressing the head of his spear to his forehead, and warded off Aillen's flame with his magical cloak, and Conn made him head of the ''[[fianna]]'' in place of Goll.<ref>Standish James O'Grady (trans.), ''[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/colloquy_ogrady.pdf The Colloquy with the Ancients]'', In Parentheses Publications, pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\n===Family===\nConn had two sons, [[Connla the Ruddy|Connla]] and [[Art mac Cuinn|Art]]. Connla fell in love with a fairy woman from [[Mag Mell]], and went with her to her otherworld home in her crystal boat, leaving Art alone. After that Art was known as ''\u00d3enfer'' \u2013 the \"lone\" or \"solitary\".<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/connla.html \"The Adventures of Connla the Fair\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 488\u2013490</ref> Connla's tale is told in the ''[[Echtra Condla]]''.\n\nAfter Conn's wife [[Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota]] <ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095745694 \"Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota on Oxford Index\"] </ref>, daughter of Cathair M\u00f3r, died, another fairy woman, [[B\u00e9 Chuille]], was banished by the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] to Ireland. She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her [[currach]], but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother. She told Conn that the famine would end if he would put B\u00e9 Chuille away, but he refused. B\u00e9 Chuille was later banished from Tara as the result of a series of challenges she and Art made each other over a game of ''[[fidchell]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/art.html \"The Adventures of Art son of Conn\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 491\u2013502</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nConn was eventually killed by [[Tipraite T\u00edrech]], king of the [[Ulaid]].

The ''Lebor Gab\u00e1la'' synchronises Conn's reign with that of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] (161\u2013180). The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' dates his reign to 116\u2013136, that of the ''Annals of the Four Masters'' to 122\u2013157.\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Cathair M\u00f3r]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of High Kings of Ireland|High King of Ireland]]|years=[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn|LGE]] 2nd century AD<br>[[Geoffrey Keating|FFE]] AD 116\u2013136<br>[[Annals of the Four Masters|AFM]] AD 122\u2013157}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Conaire C\u00f3em]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | TTM |TTM=[[Tuathal Techtmar]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | FRM | | CAM |FRM=[[Fedlimid Rechtmar]]|CAM=[[Cathair M\u00f3r]]|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | |!|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | CON |y| ETH |CON='''Conn C\u00e9tchathach'''|ETH=[[Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota]]|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|^|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|.}}\n{{familytree | | MLD |~| AMC |y| ACH | | CNL | | MML |y| SDB |y| AAL | | SAR |V| CNC |MLD=[[Medb Lethderg]]|AMC=[[Art mac Cuinn]]|ACH=[[Achtan]]|CNL=Connla|MML=Macnia mac Lugdach|SAR=Saruit|AAL=[[Ailill Aulom]]|SDB=[[Sadb ingen Chuinn|Sadb]]|CNC=[[Conaire C\u00f3em]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | |:|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | CMA | | | | | | | | | | LMC | | EOM | | | | | | |:|CMA=[[Cormac mac Airt]]|LMC=[[Lugaid mac Con]]|EOM=[[\u00c9ogan M\u00f3r]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |:| | | | | | | |:|}}\n{{familytree | | |F|~|~|~|V|~|A|~|V|~|~|~|V|~|~|~|7| | | | | |:| | | | | | | |:|}}\n{{familytree | | CNN | | UIN | | DLR | | UIM | | AIR | | | | EOG | | | | | | DLR | |CNN=''[[Connachta]]''|UIN=''[[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]]''|DLR=''[[*]]''|UIM=''[[U\u00ed Maine]]''|AIR=''[[Airg\u00edalla]]''|EOG=''[[Connacht Elanesse]]''}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Explanatory notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{Connachta}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conn Of The Hundred Battles}}\n[[Category:Cycles of the Kings]]\n[[Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Fenian Cycle]]\n", "name_user": "Cormac1cormac1", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDeath", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conn_of_the_Hundred_Battles"}

Fish and Roses integrated fish farming and hydroponics into the school's curriculum.  Mark Weber, the project originator, and Ted Howard, Sr., the principal wanted to see the project used as the focus of a new math and science based school.  A separate building was built with funding from Boeing and Costco to house the project but within a few years the building was razed to make room for the new gym and school remodel.\n\nIn 2003, under a Gates Foundation grant, the district separated Cleveland into four small academies - the Infotech Academy, which had started up in a small way in 2000 before the grant; the Arts and Humanities Academy; the Health, Environment and Life Academy (HEAL); and the Global Studies Academy. By 2009 Cleveland retained the Global Studies and HEAL academies, but overall academic improvement remained elusive. 56.7% of students graduated in 2009, on time or otherwise.\n\nIn 2008, Cleveland was one of two high schools included in the Southeast Initiative, a plan to increase expenditures for three years at schools that parents had fled under the school choice plan. The Seattle Times School Guide reported that Cleveland's 2008 on-time graduation rate had been 44%. Cleveland's enrollment remained low at 695 students in 2008-2009, 94% of them from minority ethnic groups. Few of Cleveland's students chose it as their first choice.\n\nStarting in fall 2010, Cleveland will become a citywide Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) high school, divided into a Life Sciences and Global Health academy and an Engineering and Computer Science academy. Only 21% of Cleveland's 10th graders passed the [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] math test in 2009 and 16% passed the science test, up from 12% and 6.9% in 2008. Cleveland's 2010-2011 11th and 12th graders will not be accepted into STEM, but will continue to attend Cleveland in a general studies program until the transition is complete. The school's 2009-2010 9th graders will be enrolled in STEM as 10th graders. A new incoming 9th grade class from throughout the city will be the model for all future STEM cohorts. Future high schoolers from Cleveland's own neighborhood, if they do not enroll in STEM, will be sent to nearby high schools. STEM enrollment at Cleveland is open to any student who will be in the 9th or 10th grade in fall 2010, with no prerequisites. Cleveland's school day will be half an hour longer than in other Seattle high schools.\n\nBy the time school opened in September 2010, the name of the engineering academy became the School of Engineering and Design. Computer Science was not dropped but is an elective course open to students in 9-12. Juniors and seniors will be allowed to take freshman and sophomore STEM courses if they wish.\n\n=}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Cleveland High School (Seattle)}}\n\n* Cleveland High School Alumni Association website<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clevelandalumsea.org/|title=Home|website=Cleveland High School Alumni Association|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n*[http://www.seattleschools.org/schools/cleveland/ Cleveland High School website]\n\n{{WIAA Sea-King District 2|A|3A}}\n{{Seattle Schools}}\n\n[[Category:High schools in King County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Seattle Public Schools]]\n[[Category:Public high schools in Washington (state)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox school\n|name           = Cleveland High School\n|image          = Seattle - Cleveland High School 01A.jpg\n|imagesize      = \n|image caption  = \n|motto          = \n|established    = 1927\n|fundingtype    = [[Public school (government funded)|Public]]\n|schooltype     = [[High school#United States|high school]]\n|district       = [[Seattle School District]]\n|grades         = [[ninth grade|9]]-[[twelfth grade|12]]\n|principal      = George Breland\n|address        = 5511 15th Avenue South\n|city           = [[Seattle]]\n|state          = [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]\n|zipcode        = 98108\n|country        = USA\n|coordinates    = {{coord|47|33|09|N|122|18|51|W|format=dms|display=inline,title|type:landmark_region:US-WA}}\n|campus type    = \n|campus size    = {{convert|5.1|acre|m2}}\n|enrollment     = 858 (2016-17)<ref name=\"2016-2017 Report\">{{cite web|title=School Report for the 2016\u20132017 School Year|url=https://www.seattleschools.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_543/File/District/Departments/REA/school_reports/current/Cleveland.PDF|publisher=Seattle Public Schools|accessdate=4 July 2018}}</ref> \n|faculty        = 49\n|mascot         = [[Eagle]]\n|mascot image   =\n|rival          = [[Franklin High School (Seattle)|Franklin High School]] \n|colors         = [[Red]] [[Black]] and [[white]] {{color box|red}} {{color box|white}} {{color box|black}}\n|homepage       = [http://www.seattleschools.org/schools/cleveland/ Cleveland High School]\n{{Designation list\n| embed = yes\n| designation1 = Seattle Landmark \n| designation1_date = 1981<ref name=\"Seattle list\">{{cite web|title=Landmarks and Designation|publisher=City of Seattle|url=http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/preservation/landmarks_listing.htm|accessdate=2013-03-04}}</ref>\n| designation1_number =}}\n}}\n\n'''Cleveland High School''', also known as '''Grover Cleveland High School''', is a [[public high school|public secondary school]] located in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

Fish and Roses integrated fish farming and hydroponics into the school's curriculum.  Mark Weber, the project originator, and Ted Howard, Sr., the principal wanted to see the project used as the focus of a new math and science based school.  A separate building was built with funding from Boeing and Costco to house the project but within a few years the building was razed to make room for the new gym and school remodel.\n\nIn 2003, under a Gates Foundation grant, the district separated Cleveland into four small academies - the Infotech Academy, which had started up in a small way in 2000 before the grant; the Arts and Humanities Academy; the Health, Environment and Life Academy (HEAL); and the Global Studies Academy. By 2009 Cleveland retained the Global Studies and HEAL academies, but overall academic improvement remained elusive. 56.7% of students graduated in 2009, on time or otherwise.\n\nIn 2008, Cleveland was one of two high schools included in the Southeast Initiative, a plan to increase expenditures for three years at schools that parents had fled under the school choice plan. The Seattle Times School Guide reported that Cleveland's 2008 on-time graduation rate had been 44%. Cleveland's enrollment remained low at 695 students in 2008-2009, 94% of them from minority ethnic groups. Few of Cleveland's students chose it as their first choice.\n\nStarting in fall 2010, Cleveland will become a citywide Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) high school, divided into a Life Sciences and Global Health academy and an Engineering and Computer Science academy. Only 21% of Cleveland's 10th graders passed the [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] math test in 2009 and 16% passed the science test, up from 12% and 6.9% in 2008. Cleveland's 2010-2011 11th and 12th graders will not be accepted into STEM, but will continue to attend Cleveland in a general studies program until the transition is complete. The school's 2009-2010 9th graders will be enrolled in STEM as 10th graders. A new incoming 9th grade class from throughout the city will be the model for all future STEM cohorts. Future high schoolers from Cleveland's own neighborhood, if they do not enroll in STEM, will be sent to nearby high schools. STEM enrollment at Cleveland is open to any student who will be in the 9th or 10th grade in fall 2010, with no prerequisites. Cleveland's school day will be half an hour longer than in other Seattle high schools.\n\nBy the time school opened in September 2010, the name of the engineering academy became the School of Engineering and Design. Computer Science was not dropped but is an elective course open to students in 9-12. Juniors and seniors will be allowed to take freshman and sophomore STEM courses if they wish.\n\n=}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Cleveland High School (Seattle)}}\n*[http://www.seattleschools.org/schools/cleveland/ Cleveland High School website]\n\n{{WIAA Sea-King District 2|A|3A}}\n{{Seattle Schools}}\n\n[[Category:High schools in King County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Seattle Public Schools]]\n[[Category:Public high schools in Washington (state)]]\n", "name_user": "Allengs99", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:added alumni association link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_High_School_(Seattle)"}

Forced to abandon Ormuz in January 1508, he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of Socotra, returned to Ormuz, and then headed to India.\n\n====Arrest at Cannanore, 1509====\nAfonso arrived at [[Kannur|Cannanore]] on the [[Malabarian Coast|Malabar coast]] in December 1508, where he opened before the viceroy, Dom Francisco de Almeida, the sealed letter which he had received from the King, and which named as governor to succeed Almeida.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/><ref>Afonso, like many others since then, took office as governor: when appointing the Viceroy Francisco de Almeida, the King promised not to appoint another in his lifetime, a vote of confidence in contradiction with the short term of three years he gave him, that may be due to the great fears about the sharing of power that this position represented.</ref><ref>In the first months of 1508, the son of D.

Afonso avoided confrontation, which could have led to civil war, and moved to [[Kochi, India]], to await further instruction from the King, maintaining his entourage himself. He was described by [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda]] as patiently enduring open opposition from the group that had gathered around Almeida, with whom he kept formal contact. Increasingly isolated, he wrote to [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]], who arrived in India with a new fleet, but was ignored as Sequeira joined the Viceroy. At the same time, Afonso refused approaches from opponents of the Viceroy, who encouraged him to seize power.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda|title=Historia do Descobrimento e Conquista da India pelos Portugueses|url=https://archive.org/details/historiadodesco08castgoog|year=1833|publisher=Typographia Rollandiana}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 1509, Almeida fought the naval [[Battle of Diu]] against a joint fleet of [[Burji dynasty|Mamluks]], [[Ottomans]], the [[Zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], and the [[Mahmud Begada|Sultan of Gujarat]], regarding it as personal revenge for the death of his son. His victory was decisive: the Ottomans and Mamluks abandoned the Indian Ocean, easing the way for Portuguese rule there for the next century. In August, after a petition from Afonso's former officers with the support of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira claiming him unfit for governance, Afonso was sent in custody to [[St. Angelo Fort]] in [[Kannur|Cannanore]].{{sfn|Stephens|1897|pp=61\u201362}}<ref>{{cite book|author=R.

The attack was unsuccessful, as Marshal Fernando Coutinho ventured into the inner city against instructions, fascinated by its richness, and was ambushed. During the rescue, Afonso was shot in the chest and had to retreat, barely escaping with his life. Coutinho was killed during the escape.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/>\n\nSoon after the failed attack, Afonso assembled a fleet of 23 ships and 1200 men. Contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate]] fleet in the Red Sea or return to Hormuz. However, he had been informed by [[Timoji]] (a privateer in the service of the Hindu [[Vijayanagara Empire]]) that it would be easier to fight them in [[Goa]], where they had sheltered after the Battle of Diu,<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\">Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry, Charles J. Borges, \"Goa-Kanara Portuguese relations, 1498\u20131763\" pp. 34\u201336</ref> and also of the illness of the Sultan [[Yusuf Adil Shah]], and war between the [[Deccan sultanates]].<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\"/> So he relied on surprise in the capture of Goa from the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]]. He thus completed another mission, for Portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal \"guest\" of Kochi and had been coveting Goa as the best trading port in the region.\n\nA first assault took place in Goa from 4 March to 20 May 1510. After initial occupation, feeling unable to hold the city given the poor condition of its fortifications, the cooling of Hindu residents' support and insubordination among his ranks following an attack by [[Ismail Adil Shah]], Afonso refused a truce offered by the Sultan and abandoned the city in August. His fleet was scattered, and a palace revolt in Kochi hindered his recovery, so he headed to [[Fort Anjediva]]. New ships arrived from Portugal, which were intended for the nobleman Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos at Malacca, who had been given a rival command of the region.\n\nThree months later, on 25 November Afonso reappeared at Goa with a renovated fleet. Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos was compelled to accompany him with the reinforcements for Malacca<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> and about 300 Malabari reinforcements from Cannanore. In less than a day, they took Goa from Ismail Adil Shah and his Ottoman allies, who surrendered on 10 December. It is estimated that 6000 of the 9000 Muslim defenders of the city died, either in the fierce battle in the streets or by drowning while trying to escape.<ref>Kerr, Robert (1824)</ref> Afonso regained the support of the Hindu population, although he frustrated the initial expectations of Timoji, who aspired to become governor. Afonso rewarded him by appointing him chief \"[[Aguazil]]\" of the city, an administrator and representative of the Hindu and Muslim people, as a knowledgeable interpreter of the local customs.<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\"/> He then made an agreement to lower the yearly tribute.\n[[File:Coining of money for D'Albuquerque at Goa, 1510.jpg|thumb|Coining of money for d'Albuquerque at Goa (1510)]]\nIn Goa, Afonso established the first Portuguese [[Mint (coin)|mint]] in the East, after Timoja's merchants had complained of the scarcity of currency, taking it as an opportunity to solidify the territorial conquest.<ref>{{cite book|title=Goa Through the Ages: An economic history|year=1990|isbn=978-81-7022-226-2|pages=220\u2013221}}</ref> The new [[Portuguese Indian rupia|coin]], based on the existing local coins, showed a cross on the obverse and an [[armillary sphere]] (or \"esfera\"), King Manuel's badge, on the reverse.

So it was to do Our Lord\u2019s service that we were brought here; by taking Malacca, we would close the Straits so that never again would the Moslems be able to bring their spices by this route.... I am very sure that, if this Malacca trade is taken out of their hands, Cairo and Mecca will be completely lost.''\" (The Commentaries of the Great Afonso de Albuquerque)\n[[File:A famosa.jpg|thumb|The surviving gate of the [[A Famosa]] Portuguese fortress in [[Malacca]]]]\nIn February 1511, through a friendly Hindu merchant, Nina Chatu, Afonso received a letter from Rui de Ara\u00fajo, one of the nineteen Portuguese held at Malacca since 1509. It urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their release, and gave details of the fortifications. Afonso showed it to Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, as an argument to advance in a joint fleet. In April 1511, after fortifying Goa, he gathered a force of about 900 Portuguese, 200 Hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships.<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp23\">{{cite book|last=Ricklefs|first=M.C.|title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300 (2nd Ed.)|year=1991|publisher=MacMillan|location=London|isbn=0-333-57689-6|page=23}}</ref> He then sailed to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] against orders and despite the protest of Diogo Mendes, who claimed command of the expedition. Afonso eventually centralized the Portuguese government in the Indian Ocean. After the Malaccan conquest he wrote a letter to the King to explain his disagreement with Diogo Mendes, suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the Portuguese in India.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Under his command was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who had participated in the failed embassy of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1509.\n\nAfter a false start towards the Red Sea, they sailed to the Strait of Malacca. It was the richest city that the Portuguese tried to take, and a focal point in the trade network where Malay traders met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic, among others, described by [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] as of invaluable richness. Despite its wealth, it was mostly a wooden-built city, with few masonry buildings but was defended by a mercenary force estimated at 20,000 men and more than 2000 pieces of artillery. Its greatest weakness was the unpopularity of the government of [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]], who favoured Muslims, arousing dissatisfaction amongst other merchants.\n\nAfonso made a bold approach to the city, his ships decorated with banners, firing cannon volleys. He declared himself lord of all the navigation, demanded the Sultan release the prisoners and pay for damages, and demanded consent to build a fortified trading post. The Sultan eventually freed the prisoners, but was unimpressed by the small Portuguese contingent. Afonso then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings as a demonstration. The city being divided by the Malacca River, the connecting bridge was a strategic point, so at dawn on 25 July the Portuguese landed and fought a tough battle, facing poisoned arrows, taking the bridge in the evening. After fruitlessly waiting for the Sultan's reaction, they returned to the ships and prepared a [[Junk (ship)|junk]] (offered by Chinese merchants), filling it with men, artillery and sandbags. Commanded by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]], it sailed upriver at high tide to the bridge. The day after, all had landed. After a fierce fight during which the Sultan appeared with an army of [[war elephant]]s, the defenders were dispersed and the Sultan fled.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Afonso waited for the reaction of the Sultan. Merchants approached, asking for Portuguese protection. They were given banners to mark their premises, a sign that they would not be looted. On 15 August, the Portuguese attacked again, but the Sultan had fled the city. Under strict orders, they looted the city, but respected the banners.<ref name=\"Bosworth2007\">{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Clifford Edmund|title=Historic cities of the Islamic world|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&pg=PA317|accessdate=23 August 2011|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-15388-2|page=317}}</ref>\nAfonso prepared Malacca's defenses against a Malay counterattack,<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp23\"/> building a fortress, assigning his men to shifts and using stones from the mosque and the cemetery. Despite the delays caused by heat and malaria, it was completed in November 1511, its surviving door now known as \"[[A Famosa]]\" ('the famous'). It was possibly then that Afonso had a large stone engraved with the names of the participants in the conquest. To quell disagreements over the order of the names, he had it set facing the wall, with the single inscription ''Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes'' (Latin for \"The stone the builders rejected\", from [[David]]'s prophecy, Psalm 118:22\u201323) on the front.<ref>{{cite book|author=Afonso de Albuquerque|title=Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque: capit\u00e3o geral que foi das Indias Orientaes em tempo do muito poderoso rey D.

In ships from [[Portuguese Malacca]], Rafael sailed to Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) in 1513, and again from 1515 to 1516 to trade with Chinese merchants. These ventures, along with those of [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] and [[Fern\u00e3o Pires de Andrade]], were the first direct European diplomatic and commercial ties with China. However, after the death of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]] on 19 April 1521, conservative factions at court seeking to limit eunuch influence rejected the new Portuguese embassy, fought sea battles with the Portuguese around [[Tuen Mun]], and Tom\u00e9 was forced to write letters to Malacca stating that he and other ambassadors would not be released from prison in China until the Portuguese relinquished their control of Malacca and returned it to the deposed [[Sultan of Malacca]] (who was previously a Ming tributary vassal).<ref>Mote, Frederick W. and Denis Twitchett.

During Afonso's absence from Malacca, Portuguese who opposed the taking of Goa had waived its possession, even writing to the King that it would be best to let it go. Held up by the monsoon and with few forces available, Afonso had to wait for the arrival of reinforcement fleets headed by his nephew D. Garcia de Noronha, and Jorge de Mello Pereira.\n\nWhile at Cochin, Albuquerque started a school. In a private letter to King Manuel I, he states that he had found a chest full of books with which to teach the children of married Portuguese settlers (''casados'') and Christian converts to read and write which, according to Albuquerque, there were about a hundred in his time, \"all very sharp and easily learn what they are taught\".<ref>Afonso de Albuquerque ''Cartas para El-Rei D. Manuel I'' edited by Ant\u00f3nio Bai\u00e3o (1942). Letter of 1 April 1512</ref>\n\nOn 10 September 1512, Afonso sailed from Cochin to Goa with fourteen ships carrying 1,700 soldiers. Determined to recapture the fortress, he ordered trenches dug and a wall breached. But on the day of the planned final assault, Rasul Khan surrendered. Afonso demanded the fort be handed over with its artillery, ammunition and horses, and the deserters to be given up. Some had joined Rasul Khan when the Portuguese were forced to flee Goa in May 1510, others during the recent siege. Rasul Khan consented, on condition that their lives be spared. Afonso agreed and he left Goa. He did spare the lives of the deserters, but had them horribly mutilated. One such renegade was [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes (soldier)|Fern\u00e3o Lopes]], bound for Portugal in custody, who escaped at the island of Saint Helena and led a 'Robinson Crusoe' life for many years. After such measures the town became the most prosperous Portuguese settlement in India.\n\n===Campaign in the Red Sea, 1513===\nIn December 1512 an envoy from [[Ethiopia]] arrived at Goa. [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Mateus]] was sent by the regent queen [[Eleni of Ethiopia|Eleni]], following the arrival of the Portuguese from Socotra in 1507, as an ambassador for the king of Portugal in search of a coalition to help face growing Muslim influence. He was received in Goa with great honour by Afonso, as a long-sought \"[[Prester John]]\" envoy. His arrival was announced by King Manuel to [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513. Although Mateus faced the distrust of Afonso's rivals, who tried to prove he was some impostor or Muslim spy, Afonso sent him to Portugal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Millet Rogers|title=The Quest for Eastern Christians|url=https://archive.org/details/questforeasternc0000roge|url-access=registration|year=1962|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-0275-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/questforeasternc0000roge/page/n102 1]}}</ref> The King is described as having wept with joy at their report.\n\nIn February 1513, while Mateus was in Portugal, Afonso sailed to the Red Sea with a force of about 1000 Portuguese and 400 Malabaris.

After half a day of fierce battle Afonso was forced to retreat. He cruised the Red Sea inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], with the first European fleet to have sailed this route.

As naval trade faltered and vassals defected, with no foreseeable solutions to the conflict with the Portuguese, the court of the Zamorin fell to in-fighting. The ruling Zamorin was assassinated and replaced by a rival, under the instigation of Albuquerque. Thus, peace talks could commence. the Portuguese were allowed to build a fortress in Calicut itself, and acquired rights to obtain as much pepper and ginger as they wished, at stipulated prices, and half the customs of Calicut as yearly tribute.<ref>Elaine Sanceau (1936).

At that time, Portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas. In 1511 under a policy which Afonso promulgated, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or \"married men\") who ventured overseas and married local women. With Afonso's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished. He appointed local people for positions in the Portuguese administration and did not interfere with local traditions (except \"[[Sati (practice)|sati]]\", the practice of immolating widows, which he banned).\n\nIn March 1514 King Manuel sent to [[Pope Leo X]] a huge and exotic embassy led by [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]], who toured the streets of Rome in an extravagant procession of animals from the colonies and wealth from the Indies. His reputation reached its peak, laying foundations of the Portuguese Empire in the East.\n\nIn early 1514, Afonso sent ambassadors to [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat's Sultan]] [[Muzaffar Shah II]], ruler of [[Cambay]], to seek permission to build a fort on [[Diu, India]]. The mission returned without an agreement, but [[diplomatic gift]]s were exchanged, including an [[Indian rhinoceros]].<ref>Bedini, p. 112</ref> Afonso sent the gift, named ''ganda'', and its Indian keeper, Ocem, to King Manuel.<ref name=\"lambe\">[http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html Hist\u00f3ria do famoso rhinocerus de Albrecht D\u00fcrer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218155010/http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html |date=18 February 2009 }}, Projecto Lambe-Lambe {{in lang|pt}}.</ref> In late 1515, Manuel sent it as a gift, the famous [[D\u00fcrer's Rhinoceros]] to Pope Leo X.

The [[shah]]'s ambassador to Bijapur invited Afonso to send back an envoy to Persia. Miguel Ferreira was sent via Ormuz to [[Tabriz]], where he had several interviews with the shah about common goals on defeating the Mamluk sultan.\n\nAt the same time, Albuquerque decided to conclude the effective conquest of Hormuz. He had learned that after the Portuguese retreat in 1507, a young king was reigning under the influence of a powerful Persian [[vizier]], Reis Hamed, whom the king greatly feared. At Ormuz in March 1515, Afonso met the king and asked the vizier to be present. He then had him immediately stabbed and killed by his entourage, thus \"freeing\" the dominated king, so the island in the Persian Gulf yielded to him without resistance and remained a vassal state of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Ormuz itself would not be Persian territory for another century, until a British-Persian alliance finally expelled the Portuguese in 1622.<ref name=\"intlhistory.blogspot.com.au\">\" target=\"_blank\"http://intlhistory.blogspot.com.au/2012/07/alfonso-de-albuquerque-history-figure.html</ref> At Ormuz, Afonso met with Miguel Ferreira, returning with rich presents and an ambassador, carrying a letter from the Persian potentate Shah Ismael, inviting Afonso to become a leading lord in Persia.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Holland Rose |author2=Ernest Alfred Benians |author3=Arthur Percival Newton |title=The Cambridge History of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y-08AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA12|year=1928|publisher=CUP Archive|page=12}}</ref> There he remained, engaging in diplomatic efforts, receiving envoys and overseeing the construction of the new fortress, while becoming increasingly ill.

At this time, his political enemies at the Portuguese court were planning his downfall. They had lost no opportunity in stirring up the jealousy of King Manuel against him, insinuating that Afonso intended to usurp power in Portuguese India.<ref name=\"Albuquerque\">Albuquerque, Br\u00e1s de (1774).

Hearing rumours that the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultan of Egypt]] was preparing a magnificent army at Suez to prevent the conquest of Ormuz, he repented of having replaced Afonso, and in March 1516 urgently wrote to Albergaria to return the command of all operations to Afonso and provide him with resources to face the Egyptian threat. He organized a new Portuguese navy in Asia, with orders that Afonso (if he was still in India), be made commander-in-chief against the Sultan of Cairo's armies. Manuel would afterwards learn that Afonso had died many months earlier, and that his reversed decision had been delivered many months too late.<ref name=\"Early\"/><ref name=\"Albuquerque\"/>\n\nAfter 51 years, in 1566, his body was moved to Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a church in Lisbon,<ref>''Bibliotheca Lusitana'', Diogo Barbosa Machado, Tomo I, p. 23</ref> which was ruined and rebuilt after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755 Great Lisbon earthquake]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Monument to Afonso de Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|upright|Albuquerque Monument on [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square]] in Lisbon (1902)]]\nKing Manuel I of Portugal was belatedly convinced of Afonso's loyalty, and endeavoured to atone for his lack of confidence in Afonso by heaping honours upon his son, [[Br\u00e1s de Albuquerque]] (1500\u20131580),<ref>Stier, Hans Erich (1942) ''Die Welt als Geschichte: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Universalgeschichte''.

In 1557 his son published a collection of his letters under the title ''Commentarios do Grande Affonso d'Alboquerque''<ref>Forbes, Jack D.

There Afonso was described as \"a man of middle stature, with a long face, fresh complexion, the nose somewhat large. He was a prudent man, and a Latin scholar, and spoke in elegant phrases; his conversation and writings showed his excellent education. He was of ready words, very authoritative in his commands, very circumspect in his dealings with the Moors, and greatly feared yet greatly loved by all, a quality rarely found united in one captain. He was very valiant and favoured by fortune.\"<ref>Albuquerque, Br\u00e1s, ''Commentaries'', vol VI, p. 198</ref>\n\nIn 1572, Afonso's feats were described in ''[[The Lusiads]]'', the Portuguese main [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es|Lu\u00eds Vaz de Cam\u00f5es]] (Canto X, strophes 40\u201349). The poet praises his achievements, but has the [[muses]] frown upon the harsh rule of his men, of whom Cam\u00f5es was almost a contemporary fellow. In 1934, Afonso was celebrated by [[Fernando Pessoa]] in ''Mensagem'', a symbolist epic. In the first part of this work, called \"Bras\u00e3o\" (Coat-of-Arms), he relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields in the Portuguese coat-of-arms, Afonso being one of the wings of the [[griffin]] headed by Henry the Navigator, the other wing being King John II.\n\nA [[Alphonso (mango)|variety of mango]] that he used to bring on his journeys to India has been named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alphonso mangoes|work=Savani Farms|url=http://www.savanifarms.com/|accessdate=14 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nNumerous homages have been paid to Afonso; he is featured in the [[Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos]] monument; there is a [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square|square carrying his name]] in the Portuguese capital of [[Lisbon]], which also features a bronze statue; two Portuguese Navy ships have been named in his honour: the sloop [[Afonso de Albuquerque (1884)|NRP ''Afonso de Albuquerque'' (1884)]] and the warship [[NRP Afonso de Albuquerque|NRP ''Afonso de Albuquerque'']], the latter belonging to a sloop class named Albuquerque.\n\n===Global legacy===\n[[File:Portuguese discoveries and explorationsV2en.png|thumb|upright=2|[[Portuguese discoveries]] and explorations: first arrival places and dates; main Portuguese [[spice trade]] routes in the [[Indian Ocean]] (blue)]]\nThe fabled [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] were on the imagination of Europe since ancient times.

Francisco de Almeida, [[Louren\u00e7o de Almeida]], died in dramatic circumstances at the [[Battle of Chaul]] and there are reports that the viceroy, an enlightened and incorruptible ruler, turned vindictive and cruel.</ref>\nThe viceroy, supported by the officers who had abandoned Afonso at Ormuz, had a matching royal order, but declined to yield, protesting that his term ended only in January and stating his intention to avenge his son's death by fighting the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] fleet of [[Mirocem]], refusing Afonso's offer to fight him himself. Afonso avoided confrontation, which could have led to civil war, and moved to [[Kochi, India]], to await further instruction from the King, maintaining his entourage himself. He was described by [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda]] as patiently enduring open opposition from the group that had gathered around Almeida, with whom he kept formal contact. Increasingly isolated, he wrote to [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]], who arrived in India with a new fleet, but was ignored as Sequeira joined the Viceroy. At the same time, Afonso refused approaches from opponents of the Viceroy, who encouraged him to seize power.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda|title=Historia do Descobrimento e Conquista da India pelos Portugueses|url=https://archive.org/details/historiadodesco08castgoog|year=1833|publisher=Typographia Rollandiana}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 1509, Almeida fought the naval [[Battle of Diu]] against a joint fleet of [[Burji dynasty|Mamluks]], [[Ottomans]], the [[Zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], and the [[Mahmud Begada|Sultan of Gujarat]], regarding it as personal revenge for the death of his son. His victory was decisive: the Ottomans and Mamluks abandoned the Indian Ocean, easing the way for Portuguese rule there for the next century. In August, after a petition from Afonso's former officers with the support of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira claiming him unfit for governance, Afonso was sent in custody to [[St. Angelo Fort]] in [[Kannur|Cannanore]].{{sfn|Stephens|1897|pp=61\u201362}}<ref>{{cite book|author=R.

He was succeeded by Duarte de Lemos, but left for Cochin and then for Portugal, leaving his fleet to Afonso.\n\n===Conquest of Goa, 1510===\n{{Main|Portuguese Conquest of Goa (1510)}}\n[[File:\"Plan de Goa\", in Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages,1750.jpg|thumb|Illustration depicts the aftermath of the [[Portuguese conquest of Goa]], from the forces of [[Yusuf Adil Shah]].]]\nIn January 1510, obeying the orders from the King and aware of the absence of [[Zamorin]], Afonso advanced on Calicut. The attack was unsuccessful, as Marshal Fernando Coutinho ventured into the inner city against instructions, fascinated by its richness, and was ambushed. During the rescue, Afonso was shot in the chest and had to retreat, barely escaping with his life. Coutinho was killed during the escape.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/>\n\nSoon after the failed attack, Afonso assembled a fleet of 23 ships and 1200 men. Contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate]] fleet in the Red Sea or return to Hormuz. However, he had been informed by [[Timoji]] (a privateer in the service of the Hindu [[Vijayanagara Empire]]) that it would be easier to fight them in [[Goa]], where they had sheltered after the Battle of Diu,<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\">Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry, Charles J. Borges, \"Goa-Kanara Portuguese relations, 1498\u20131763\" pp. 34\u201336</ref> and also of the illness of the Sultan [[Yusuf Adil Shah]], and war between the [[Deccan sultanates]].<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\"/> So he relied on surprise in the capture of Goa from the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]]. He thus completed another mission, for Portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal \"guest\" of Kochi and had been coveting Goa as the best trading port in the region.\n\nA first assault took place in Goa from 4 March to 20 May 1510. After initial occupation, feeling unable to hold the city given the poor condition of its fortifications, the cooling of Hindu residents' support and insubordination among his ranks following an attack by [[Ismail Adil Shah]], Afonso refused a truce offered by the Sultan and abandoned the city in August. His fleet was scattered, and a palace revolt in Kochi hindered his recovery, so he headed to [[Fort Anjediva]]. New ships arrived from Portugal, which were intended for the nobleman Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos at Malacca, who had been given a rival command of the region.\n\nThree months later, on 25 November Afonso reappeared at Goa with a renovated fleet. Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos was compelled to accompany him with the reinforcements for Malacca<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> and about 300 Malabari reinforcements from Cannanore. In less than a day, they took Goa from Ismail Adil Shah and his Ottoman allies, who surrendered on 10 December. It is estimated that 6000 of the 9000 Muslim defenders of the city died, either in the fierce battle in the streets or by drowning while trying to escape.<ref>Kerr, Robert (1824)</ref> Afonso regained the support of the Hindu population, although he frustrated the initial expectations of Timoji, who aspired to become governor. Afonso rewarded him by appointing him chief \"[[Aguazil]]\" of the city, an administrator and representative of the Hindu and Muslim people, as a knowledgeable interpreter of the local customs.<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\"/> He then made an agreement to lower the yearly tribute.\n[[File:Coining of money for D'Albuquerque at Goa, 1510.jpg|thumb|Coining of money for d'Albuquerque at Goa (1510)]]\nIn Goa, Afonso established the first Portuguese [[Mint (coin)|mint]] in the East, after Timoja's merchants had complained of the scarcity of currency, taking it as an opportunity to solidify the territorial conquest.<ref>{{cite book|title=Goa Through the Ages: An economic history|year=1990|isbn=978-81-7022-226-2|pages=220\u2013221}}</ref> The new [[Portuguese Indian rupia|coin]], based on the existing local coins, showed a cross on the obverse and an [[armillary sphere]] (or \"esfera\"), King Manuel's badge, on the reverse.

So it was to do Our Lord\u2019s service that we were brought here; by taking Malacca, we would close the Straits so that never again would the Moslems be able to bring their spices by this route.... I am very sure that, if this Malacca trade is taken out of their hands, Cairo and Mecca will be completely lost.''\" (The Commentaries of the Great Afonso de Albuquerque)\n[[File:A famosa.jpg|thumb|The surviving gate of the [[A Famosa]] Portuguese fortress in [[Malacca]]]]\nIn February 1511, through a friendly Hindu merchant, Nina Chatu, Afonso received a letter from Rui de Ara\u00fajo, one of the nineteen Portuguese held at Malacca since 1509. It urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their release, and gave details of the fortifications. Afonso showed it to Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, as an argument to advance in a joint fleet. In April 1511, after fortifying Goa, he gathered a force of about 900 Portuguese, 200 Hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships.<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp23\">{{cite book|last=Ricklefs|first=M.C.|title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300 (2nd Ed.)|year=1991|publisher=MacMillan|location=London|isbn=0-333-57689-6|page=23}}</ref> He then sailed to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] against orders and despite the protest of Diogo Mendes, who claimed command of the expedition. Afonso eventually centralized the Portuguese government in the Indian Ocean. After the Malaccan conquest he wrote a letter to the King to explain his disagreement with Diogo Mendes, suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the Portuguese in India.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Under his command was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who had participated in the failed embassy of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1509.\n\nAfter a false start towards the Red Sea, they sailed to the Strait of Malacca. It was the richest city that the Portuguese tried to take, and a focal point in the trade network where Malay traders met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic, among others, described by [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] as of invaluable richness. Despite its wealth, it was mostly a wooden-built city, with few masonry buildings but was defended by a mercenary force estimated at 20,000 men and more than 2000 pieces of artillery. Its greatest weakness was the unpopularity of the government of [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]], who favoured Muslims, arousing dissatisfaction amongst other merchants.\n\nAfonso made a bold approach to the city, his ships decorated with banners, firing cannon volleys. He declared himself lord of all the navigation, demanded the Sultan release the prisoners and pay for damages, and demanded consent to build a fortified trading post. The Sultan eventually freed the prisoners, but was unimpressed by the small Portuguese contingent. Afonso then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings as a demonstration. The city being divided by the Malacca River, the connecting bridge was a strategic point, so at dawn on 25 July the Portuguese landed and fought a tough battle, facing poisoned arrows, taking the bridge in the evening. After fruitlessly waiting for the Sultan's reaction, they returned to the ships and prepared a [[Junk (ship)|junk]] (offered by Chinese merchants), filling it with men, artillery and sandbags. Commanded by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]], it sailed upriver at high tide to the bridge. The day after, all had landed. After a fierce fight during which the Sultan appeared with an army of [[war elephant]]s, the defenders were dispersed and the Sultan fled.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Afonso waited for the reaction of the Sultan. Merchants approached, asking for Portuguese protection. They were given banners to mark their premises, a sign that they would not be looted. On 15 August, the Portuguese attacked again, but the Sultan had fled the city. Under strict orders, they looted the city, but respected the banners.<ref name=\"Bosworth2007\">{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Clifford Edmund|title=Historic cities of the Islamic world|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&pg=PA317|accessdate=23 August 2011|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-15388-2|page=317}}</ref>\nAfonso prepared Malacca's defenses against a Malay counterattack,<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp23\"/> building a fortress, assigning his men to shifts and using stones from the mosque and the cemetery. Despite the delays caused by heat and malaria, it was completed in November 1511, its surviving door now known as \"[[A Famosa]]\" ('the famous'). It was possibly then that Afonso had a large stone engraved with the names of the participants in the conquest. To quell disagreements over the order of the names, he had it set facing the wall, with the single inscription ''Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes'' (Latin for \"The stone the builders rejected\", from [[David]]'s prophecy, Psalm 118:22\u201323) on the front.<ref>{{cite book|author=Afonso de Albuquerque|title=Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque: capit\u00e3o geral que foi das Indias Orientaes em tempo do muito poderoso rey D.

Soon after, Afonso sent [[Rafael Perestrello]] to southern China, seeking trade relations with the [[Ming dynasty]]. In ships from [[Portuguese Malacca]], Rafael sailed to Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) in 1513, and again from 1515 to 1516 to trade with Chinese merchants. These ventures, along with those of [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] and [[Fern\u00e3o Pires de Andrade]], were the first direct European diplomatic and commercial ties with China. However, after the death of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]] on 19 April 1521, conservative factions at court seeking to limit eunuch influence rejected the new Portuguese embassy, fought sea battles with the Portuguese around [[Tuen Mun]], and Tom\u00e9 was forced to write letters to Malacca stating that he and other ambassadors would not be released from prison in China until the Portuguese relinquished their control of Malacca and returned it to the deposed [[Sultan of Malacca]] (who was previously a Ming tributary vassal).<ref>Mote, Frederick W. and Denis Twitchett.

During Afonso's absence from Malacca, Portuguese who opposed the taking of Goa had waived its possession, even writing to the King that it would be best to let it go. Held up by the monsoon and with few forces available, Afonso had to wait for the arrival of reinforcement fleets headed by his nephew D. Garcia de Noronha, and Jorge de Mello Pereira.\n\nWhile at Cochin, Albuquerque started a school. In a private letter to King Manuel I, he states that he had found a chest full of books with which to teach the children of married Portuguese settlers (''casados'') and Christian converts to read and write which, according to Albuquerque, there were about a hundred in his time, \"all very sharp and easily learn what they are taught\".<ref>Afonso de Albuquerque ''Cartas para El-Rei D. Manuel I'' edited by Ant\u00f3nio Bai\u00e3o (1942). Letter of 1 April 1512</ref>\n\nOn 10 September 1512, Afonso sailed from Cochin to Goa with fourteen ships carrying 1,700 soldiers. Determined to recapture the fortress, he ordered trenches dug and a wall breached. But on the day of the planned final assault, Rasul Khan surrendered. Afonso demanded the fort be handed over with its artillery, ammunition and horses, and the deserters to be given up. Some had joined Rasul Khan when the Portuguese were forced to flee Goa in May 1510, others during the recent siege. Rasul Khan consented, on condition that their lives be spared. Afonso agreed and he left Goa. He did spare the lives of the deserters, but had them horribly mutilated. One such renegade was [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes (soldier)|Fern\u00e3o Lopes]], bound for Portugal in custody, who escaped at the island of Saint Helena and led a 'Robinson Crusoe' life for many years. After such measures the town became the most prosperous Portuguese settlement in India.\n\n===Campaign in the Red Sea, 1513===\nIn December 1512 an envoy from [[Ethiopia]] arrived at Goa. [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Mateus]] was sent by the regent queen [[Eleni of Ethiopia|Eleni]], following the arrival of the Portuguese from Socotra in 1507, as an ambassador for the king of Portugal in search of a coalition to help face growing Muslim influence. He was received in Goa with great honour by Afonso, as a long-sought \"[[Prester John]]\" envoy. His arrival was announced by King Manuel to [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513. Although Mateus faced the distrust of Afonso's rivals, who tried to prove he was some impostor or Muslim spy, Afonso sent him to Portugal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Millet Rogers|title=The Quest for Eastern Christians|url=https://archive.org/details/questforeasternc0000roge|url-access=registration|year=1962|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-0275-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/questforeasternc0000roge/page/n102 1]}}</ref> The King is described as having wept with joy at their report.\n\nIn February 1513, while Mateus was in Portugal, Afonso sailed to the Red Sea with a force of about 1000 Portuguese and 400 Malabaris.

After half a day of fierce battle Afonso was forced to retreat. He cruised the Red Sea inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], with the first European fleet to have sailed this route.

As naval trade faltered and vassals defected, with no foreseeable solutions to the conflict with the Portuguese, the court of the Zamorin fell to in-fighting. The ruling Zamorin was assassinated and replaced by a rival, under the instigation of Albuquerque. Thus, peace talks could commence. the Portuguese were allowed to build a fortress in Calicut itself, and acquired rights to obtain as much pepper and ginger as they wished, at stipulated prices, and half the customs of Calicut as yearly tribute.<ref>Elaine Sanceau (1936).

At that time, Portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas. In 1511 under a policy which Afonso promulgated, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or \"married men\") who ventured overseas and married local women. With Afonso's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished. He appointed local people for positions in the Portuguese administration and did not interfere with local traditions (except \"[[Sati (practice)|sati]]\", the practice of immolating widows, which he banned).\n\nIn March 1514 King Manuel sent to [[Pope Leo X]] a huge and exotic embassy led by [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]], who toured the streets of Rome in an extravagant procession of animals from the colonies and wealth from the Indies. His reputation reached its peak, laying foundations of the Portuguese Empire in the East.\n\nIn early 1514, Afonso sent ambassadors to [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat's Sultan]] [[Muzaffar Shah II]], ruler of [[Cambay]], to seek permission to build a fort on [[Diu, India]]. The mission returned without an agreement, but [[diplomatic gift]]s were exchanged, including an [[Indian rhinoceros]].<ref>Bedini, p. 112</ref> Afonso sent the gift, named ''ganda'', and its Indian keeper, Ocem, to King Manuel.<ref name=\"lambe\">[http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html Hist\u00f3ria do famoso rhinocerus de Albrecht D\u00fcrer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218155010/http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html |date=18 February 2009 }}, Projecto Lambe-Lambe {{in lang|pt}}.</ref> In late 1515, Manuel sent it as a gift, the famous [[D\u00fcrer's Rhinoceros]] to Pope Leo X.

The [[shah]]'s ambassador to Bijapur invited Afonso to send back an envoy to Persia. Miguel Ferreira was sent via Ormuz to [[Tabriz]], where he had several interviews with the shah about common goals on defeating the Mamluk sultan.\n\nAt the same time, Albuquerque decided to conclude the effective conquest of Hormuz. He had learned that after the Portuguese retreat in 1507, a young king was reigning under the influence of a powerful Persian [[vizier]], Reis Hamed, whom the king greatly feared. At Ormuz in March 1515, Afonso met the king and asked the vizier to be present. He then had him immediately stabbed and killed by his entourage, thus \"freeing\" the dominated king, so the island in the Persian Gulf yielded to him without resistance and remained a vassal state of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Ormuz itself would not be Persian territory for another century, until a British-Persian alliance finally expelled the Portuguese in 1622.<ref name=\"intlhistory.blogspot.com.au\">\" target=\"_blank\"http://intlhistory.blogspot.com.au/2012/07/alfonso-de-albuquerque-history-figure.html</ref> At Ormuz, Afonso met with Miguel Ferreira, returning with rich presents and an ambassador, carrying a letter from the Persian potentate Shah Ismael, inviting Afonso to become a leading lord in Persia.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Holland Rose |author2=Ernest Alfred Benians |author3=Arthur Percival Newton |title=The Cambridge History of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y-08AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA12|year=1928|publisher=CUP Archive|page=12}}</ref> There he remained, engaging in diplomatic efforts, receiving envoys and overseeing the construction of the new fortress, while becoming increasingly ill.

At this time, his political enemies at the Portuguese court were planning his downfall. They had lost no opportunity in stirring up the jealousy of King Manuel against him, insinuating that Afonso intended to usurp power in Portuguese India.<ref name=\"Albuquerque\">Albuquerque, Br\u00e1s de (1774).

Hearing rumours that the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultan of Egypt]] was preparing a magnificent army at Suez to prevent the conquest of Ormuz, he repented of having replaced Afonso, and in March 1516 urgently wrote to Albergaria to return the command of all operations to Afonso and provide him with resources to face the Egyptian threat. He organized a new Portuguese navy in Asia, with orders that Afonso (if he was still in India), be made commander-in-chief against the Sultan of Cairo's armies. Manuel would afterwards learn that Afonso had died many months earlier, and that his reversed decision had been delivered many months too late.<ref name=\"Early\"/><ref name=\"Albuquerque\"/>\n\nAfter 51 years, in 1566, his body was moved to Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a church in Lisbon,<ref>''Bibliotheca Lusitana'', Diogo Barbosa Machado, Tomo I, p. 23</ref> which was ruined and rebuilt after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755 Great Lisbon earthquake]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Monument to Afonso de Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|upright|Albuquerque Monument on [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square]] in Lisbon (1902)]]\nKing Manuel I of Portugal was belatedly convinced of Afonso's loyalty, and endeavoured to atone for his lack of confidence in Afonso by heaping honours upon his son, [[Br\u00e1s de Albuquerque]] (1500\u20131580),<ref>Stier, Hans Erich (1942) ''Die Welt als Geschichte: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Universalgeschichte''.

In 1557 his son published a collection of his letters under the title ''Commentarios do Grande Affonso d'Alboquerque''<ref>Forbes, Jack D.

There Afonso was described as \"a man of middle stature, with a long face, fresh complexion, the nose somewhat large. He was a prudent man, and a Latin scholar, and spoke in elegant phrases; his conversation and writings showed his excellent education. He was of ready words, very authoritative in his commands, very circumspect in his dealings with the Moors, and greatly feared yet greatly loved by all, a quality rarely found united in one captain. He was very valiant and favoured by fortune.\"<ref>Albuquerque, Br\u00e1s, ''Commentaries'', vol VI, p. 198</ref>\n\nIn 1572, Afonso's feats were described in ''[[The Lusiads]]'', the Portuguese main [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es|Lu\u00eds Vaz de Cam\u00f5es]] (Canto X, strophes 40\u201349). The poet praises his achievements, but has the [[muses]] frown upon the harsh rule of his men, of whom Cam\u00f5es was almost a contemporary fellow. In 1934, Afonso was celebrated by [[Fernando Pessoa]] in ''Mensagem'', a symbolist epic. In the first part of this work, called \"Bras\u00e3o\" (Coat-of-Arms), he relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields in the Portuguese coat-of-arms, Afonso being one of the wings of the [[griffin]] headed by Henry the Navigator, the other wing being King John II.\n\nA [[Alphonso (mango)|variety of mango]] that he used to bring on his journeys to India has been named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alphonso mangoes|work=Savani Farms|url=http://www.savanifarms.com/|accessdate=14 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nNumerous homages have been paid to Afonso; he is featured in the [[Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos]] monument; there is a [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square|square carrying his name]] in the Portuguese capital of [[Lisbon]], which also features a bronze statue; two Portuguese Navy ships have been named in his honour: the sloop [[Afonso de Albuquerque (1884)|NRP ''Afonso de Albuquerque'' (1884)]] and the warship [[NRP Afonso de Albuquerque|NRP ''Afonso de Albuquerque'']], the latter belonging to a sloop class named Albuquerque.\n\n===Global legacy===\n[[File:Portuguese discoveries and explorationsV2en.png|thumb|upright=2|[[Portuguese discoveries]] and explorations: first arrival places and dates; main Portuguese [[spice trade]] routes in the [[Indian Ocean]] (blue)]]\nThe fabled [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] were on the imagination of Europe since ancient times.

For example, if a variable {{var|x}} is to be read by process A, and process B has to write to the same variable {{var|x}} at the same time, process A might get either the old or new value of {{var|x}}.\n\n'''Process A:''' <syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n// Process A\n .\n .\n b = x + 5;               // instruction executes at time = Tx\n .\n</syntaxhighlight>'''Process B:''' <syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n// Process B\n.\n.\nx = 3 + z;               // instruction executes at time = Tx\n.\n\n</syntaxhighlight>\n[[File:Critical section fg.jpg|thumb|Fig 1: Flow graph depicting need for critical section]]\nIn cases like these, a critical section is important. In the above case, if A needs to read the updated value of {{var|x}}, executing Process A and Process B at the same time may not give required results. To prevent this, variable {{var|x}} is protected by a critical section. First, B gets the access to the section. Once B finishes writing the value, A gets the access to the critical section and variable {{var|x}} can be read.\n\nBy carefully controlling which variables are modified inside and outside the critical section, concurrent access to the shared variable are prevented. A critical section is typically used when a multi-threaded program must update multiple related variables without a separate thread making conflicting changes to that data. In a related situation, a critical section may be used to ensure that a shared resource, for example, a printer, can only be accessed by one process at a time.\n\n== Implementation of critical sections ==\nThe implementation of critical sections vary among different operating systems.[[File:Locks and critical sections.jpg|thumb|381x381px|Fig 2: Locks and critical sections in multiple threads]]\nA critical section will usually terminate in finite time,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=GNU/Linux Application Programming (2nd ed.).

In uni processor systems, this can be done by disabling interrupts on entry into the critical section, avoiding system calls that can cause a [[context switch]] while inside the section, and restoring interrupts to their previous state on exit. Any thread of execution entering any critical section anywhere in the system will, with this implementation, prevent any other thread, including an interrupt, from being granted processing time on the CPU\u2014and therefore from entering any other critical section or, indeed, any code whatsoever\u2014until the original thread leaves its critical section.\n\nThis brute-force approach can be improved upon by using [[Semaphore (programming)|Semaphore]]s. To enter a critical section, a thread must obtain a semaphore, which it releases on leaving the section. Other threads are prevented from entering the critical section at the same time as the original thread, but are free to gain control of the CPU and execute other code, including other critical sections that are protected by different semaphores. Semaphore locking also has a time limit to prevent a deadlock condition in which a lock is acquired by a single process for an infinite time stalling the other processes which need to use the shared resource protected by the critical session.\n\n==Uses of critical sections ==\n\n=== Kernel-level critical sections ===\nTypically, critical sections prevent thread and [[process migration]] between processors and the [[Preemption (computing)|preemption]] of processes and threads by interrupts and other processes and threads.\n\nCritical sections often allow nesting. Nesting allows multiple critical sections to be entered and exited at little cost.\n\nIf the [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]] interrupts the current process or thread in a critical section, the scheduler will either allow the currently executing process or thread to run to completion of the critical section, or it will schedule the process or thread for another complete quantum. The scheduler will not migrate the process or thread to another processor, and it will not schedule another process or thread to run while the current process or thread is in a critical section.\n\nSimilarly, if an [[interrupt]] occurs in a critical section, the interrupt information is recorded for future processing, and execution is returned to the process or thread in the critical section.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=November 2011|title=RESEARCH PAPER ON SOFTWARE SOLUTION OF CRITICAL SECTION PROBLEM|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268031056|journal=International Journal of Advance Technology & Engineering Research (IJATER)|volume=1}}</ref> Once the critical section is exited, and in some cases the scheduled quantum completed, the pending interrupt will be executed. The concept of scheduling quantum applies to \"[[Round-robin scheduling|round-robin]]\" and similar [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling policies]].\n\nSince critical sections may [[Execution (computers)|execute]] only on the processor on which they are entered, synchronization is only required within the executing processor. This allows critical sections to be entered and exited at almost zero cost. No inter-processor synchronization is required. Only instruction stream synchronization<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dubois, Scheurich|first=Michel, Christoph|title=Synchronization, Coherence, and Event Ordering in Multiprocessors|url=https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1749330|journal=Survey and Tutorial Series|year=1988|volume=21|issue=2|pages=9\u201321|doi=10.1109/2.15}}</ref> is needed. Most processors provide the required amount of synchronization by the simple act of interrupting the current execution state. This allows critical sections in most cases to be nothing more than a per processor count of critical sections entered.\n\nPerformance enhancements include executing pending interrupts at the exit of all critical sections and allowing the scheduler to run at the exit of all critical sections. Furthermore, pending interrupts may be transferred to other processors for execution.\n\nCritical sections should not be used as a long-lasting locking primitive. Critical sections should be kept short enough so that it can be entered, executed, and exited without any interrupts occurring from the [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] and the scheduler.\n\nKernel-level critical sections are the base of the [[software lockout]] issue.\n\n=== Critical sections in data structures ===\nIn parallel programming, the code is divided into threads. The [[Read\u2013write conflict|read-write conflicting]] variables are split between threads and each thread has a copy of them. Data structures like [[linked list|linked lists]], [[Tree (data structure)|trees]], [[hash table]]s etc. have data variables that are linked and cannot be split between threads and hence implementing parallelism is very difficult.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Parallel Multicore Architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|date=17 November 2015|publisher=|isbn=9781482211184|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> To improve the efficiency of implementing data structures multiple operations like insertion, deletion, search need to be executed in parallel. While performing these operations, there may be scenarios where the same element is being searched by one thread and is being deleted by another. In such cases, the output may be [[Erroneous program|erroneous]]. The thread searching the element may have a hit, whereas the other thread may delete it just after that time. These scenarios will cause issues in the program running by providing false data. To prevent this, one method is that the entire data-structure can be kept under critical section so that only one operation is handled at a time. Another method is locking the node in use under critical section, so that other operations do not use the same node. Using critical section, thus, ensures that the code provides expected outputs.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Critical sections in computer networking ===\nCritical sections are also needed in [[Computer network|computer networking.]] When the data arrives at [[network socket]]s, it may not arrive in an ordered format. Let's say program \u2018X\u2019 running on the machine needs to collect the data from the socket, rearrange it and check if anything is missing. While this program works on the data, no other program should access the same socket for that particular data. Hence, the data of the socket is protected by a critical section so that program \u2018X\u2019 can use it exclusively.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lock (computer science)]]\n* [[Mutual exclusion]]\n* [[Lamport's bakery algorithm]]\n* [[Dekker's algorithm]]\n* [[Eisenberg & McGuire algorithm]]\n* [[Szyma\u0144ski's algorithm]]\n* [[Peterson's algorithm]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682530.aspx Critical Section documentation] on the [[MSDN Library]] web page\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110620203242/http://www.futurechips.org/tips-for-power-coders/parallel-programming-understanding-impact-critical-sections.html Tutorial on Critical Sections]\n*[https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/806-6867/sync-12/index.html Code examples for Mutex]\n*[https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/806-6867/sync-27385/index.html Tutorial on Semaphores]\n*[https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/managing-lock-contention-large-and-small-critical-sections Lock contention in Critical Sections]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Critical Section}}\n\n[[Category:Concurrency control]]\n[[Category:Programming constructs]]\n", "text_old": "In [[concurrent programming]], concurrent accesses to shared resources can lead to unexpected or erroneous behavior, so parts of the program where the shared resource is accessed need to be protected in ways that avoid the concurrent access.

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season. The Duffer Brothers have said that ''Stranger Things'' is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n''Stranger Things'' is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], during the early 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the [[United States Department of Energy]], but secretly does experiments into the [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]], including those that involve human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], \"the Upside Down\".

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title.

Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software.

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season.

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film ''[[Red Dawn]]'' came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series,<ref name=\"rs\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://frightfind.com/stranger-things-netflix-homage/ |title=Stranger Things is an Homage to the Greats |accessdate=July 26, 2016 |website=FrightFind |date=July 26, 2016}}</ref> crafting it in the realm of [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction|horror]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/22/stranger-things-and-the-get-down-reviews |title=On Television: \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down\" |first=Emily |last=Nassbaum |date=August 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 14, 2017 |website=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref> Other influences cited by the Duffer Brothers include: [[Stephen King]] novels; films produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Wes Craven]],<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/duffer-brothers-talk-stranger-things-916180 |title=The Duffer Brothers Talk 'Stranger Things' Influences, 'It' Dreams and Netflix Phase 2 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref name=\"screenertv\">{{cite web |url=http://screenertv.com/movies/stranger-things-stephen-king-steven-spielberg-cinematic-influences/ |title=The cinematic influences behind Netflix's 'Stranger Things' |date=July 18, 2016 |work=ScreenerTV}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/07/13/how-netflixs-stranger-things-channels-steven-spielberg-john-carpenter-and-stephen-king/ |title=How Netflix's ''Stranger Things'' Channels Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter and Stephen King |first=Sarene |last=Leeds |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 13, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> and [[Guillermo del Toro]];<ref name=\"daily beast\" /> films such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"screenertv\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/stranger-things-all-the-hidden-and-not-so-hidden-references-in-p/stand-by-me/ |title=Stranger Things: all the hidden (and not-so-hidden) movie, TV and book references |website=The Telegraph |date=August 6, 2016 |accessdate=January 1, 2017}}</ref> Japanese [[anime]] such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' and ''[[Elfen Lied]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> and several [[video game]]s including ''[[Silent Hill]]'', ''[[Souls (series)|Dark Souls]]'' and ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yes, Stranger Things' Upside Down was totally inspired by Silent Hill |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/yes-stranger-things-upside-down-was-totally-inspired-by-silent-hill/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Tilly |first=Chris |title=How Silent Hill, Dark Souls and The Last of Us Influenced Stranger Things |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/08/26/how-silent-hill-dark-souls-and-the-last-of-us-influenced-stranger-things |work=[[IGN]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> The Duffer Brothers also believe that they may have brought influences from other works unintentionally, including ''[[Beyond the Black Rainbow]]'' and ''[[D.A.R.Y.L.]]'', discovered by reviewing fan feedback on the series.<ref name=\"hwr montauk\" /> Several websites and publications have found other pop culture references in the series, particularly references to 1980s pop culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/stranger-things-21-80s-relics-weve-spotted-so-far-photos/ |title=''Stranger Things'': 21 '80s Relics We've Spotted So Far |first=Meriah |last=Doty |website=[[TheWrap]] |date=July 21, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/07/stranger-things-film-reference-glossary.html |title=A ''Stranger Things'' Glossary: Every Major Film Reference in the Show, From A\u2013Z |last=Tobias |first=Scott |website=[[Vulture.com]] |date=July 18, 2016 |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://boomhowdy.com/filmtv/stranger-things-influences/ |title=Strange Influences: Our Favorite Movie References From ''Stranger Things'' |first=Tyree |last=Kimber |website=Boomhowdy.com |date=July 26, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/18481-netflix-stranger-things-80s-pop-culture-references-spielberg |title=Every '80s Pop Culture References in ''Stranger Things'' |first=Sean |last=Hutchinson |website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |date=July 19, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith Netflix as the platform, the Duffer Brothers were not limited to a typical 22-episode format, opting for the eight-episode approach.

movie rating]].

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of [[R/GA]], led by creative director Michelle Doughtey.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/stranger-things-titles-came-perfectly-retro/ |title=How the Stranger Things Titles Came Out So Perfectly Retro |first=Sean Patrick |last=Ferrell |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 11, 2017 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired series, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', which the producers had suggested to the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/stranger-things/ |title=Stranger Things (2016) |first=Will |last=Perkins |date=August 9, 2016 |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |website=[[Art of the Title]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Stranger Things}}\nThe ''Stranger Things'' original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band [[Survive (band)|Survive]].<!-- based on wp guidelines, do not change to S U R V I V E --><ref name=\"billboard music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7488050/survive-stranger-things-soundtrack-interview |title=''Stranger Things'' Co-Composer Shares the Story Behind 2016's Most Unlikely Musical Sensation |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=August 29, 2016 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref> It makes extensive use of [[synthesizer]]s in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Vangelis]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Fabio Frizzi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/06/stranger-things-playlist/ |title=Stranger Things: 10 eerie electronic gems to hear if you loved the Netflix show |website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the series to Netflix.<ref name=\"billboard music\" /><ref name=\"rs music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/stranger-things-survive-talk-their-creepy-nostalgic-score-w431789 |title='Stranger Things': Meet the Band Behind Show's Creepy, Nostalgic Score |first=Christopher |last=Weingarten |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', where Survive features on the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruttadaro |first1=Andrew |title=How the Duffer Brothers Picked the Perfect Music for 'Stranger Things' |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/08/stranger-things-music-duffer-brothers-interview |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music;
