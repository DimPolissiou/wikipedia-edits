Within this range are the Great V\u00e1pennej and \u010certova Valley. It was proclaimed in 1953 to encompass 109 ha. A new decree in 1988 amended the boundaries. Today it covers 333.31 ha. It was established to protect the [[karst]] phenomena, preserve the forests of the Little Carpathians, and protect endangered species.<ref>http://www.solosnica.sk/o-obci/z-historie-obce/</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first time Solo\u0161nica was mentioned was in 1367. The beginning of its existence is closely connected with an internal colonization at the beginning of the 14th century. Solo\u0161nica had several different names throughout the centuries, some of which are Zeleskut, Pratunprun (1367), Zyleskut (1371), Solossnicza (1773) or Sz\u00e9lesk\u00fat from the Hungarian language, where ''sz\u00e9les'' stands for ''broad'' and ''k\u00fat'' means ''well'' (presumably a watering place for grazing cattle). The German name ''Breitenbrunn'' (not to be confused with [[Breitenbrunn, Austria]]) also corresponds with the similar translation of the parts of this compound word referring to its name (''breit'' means ''broad'' and ''brunn'' means ''well'' or ''spring''). The Hungarian form of the name had the most important impact on forming the Slovak version. The word ''so\u013e'' referring to the ''salt'' connected to the suffix ''-nica'' created the complete Slovak version of the name for the village. There is even a particular area within the village called Slanisko, the word stem of which word is obviously \"salt or salty\".\n\nSolo\u0161nica belonged to the earls from [[Sv\u00e4t\u00fd Jur]] and [[Pezinok]], earldom of Ser\u00e9dy inhabiting Plaveck\u00fd Castle, earldom of Balass and later on to the earldom of Plavec (there were several families and their generations that were changed throughout the years as its owners). From the 17th century on, Plaveck\u00fd Castle and the nearby villages had been registered in the ownership of the P\u00e1lfys.\n\nAccording to the charter named \"Colonia sub montem Rachsturm\" from 1478, there was a settlement called \"H\u00f3lint\" located under the hill called \"Ro\u0161turm\" within the area of Solo\u0161nica. This settlement was occupied by forest workers of German origin called \"holchokari. There were about 20 houses made of wood. The settlement went through a little bit of decadence and decline after 1781 when the [[Patent of Toleration]] was declared. This document did not allow establishment of an [[Evangelicalism|evangelic]] chapel that would be used for praying and worship in places where there were not at least a hundred evangelic families. Therefore, the majority of the population of this settlement moved either to Solo\u0161nica or to Pezinok. There are many of their descendants living in Solo\u0161nica even today.\n\nIn 1828 there were 205 houses and the population of Solo\u0161nica was 1484. These people were primarily engaged in agriculture, weaving, furriery, and [[calcination]]s which continued until 1950. The production and manufacture of wooden tools was also very popular among people back then and thus has continued into the present.\n\n===Natural disasters===\nSolo\u0161nica has gone through and already witnessed several disasters. In 1857 a huge and disastrous fire broke out. In about half an hour, most of the houses already caught fire because their roofs were made from straw. 12 people died as a result of this terrible fire. There were only six houses and the church left afterwards. In 1861 during the celebrations devoted to the [[Holy Ghost]] there was a strong storm with heavy rain which resulted in the level of the Solo\u0161nica Stream rising and flooding a substantial part of the village.\n\nLots of inhabitants of Solo\u0161nica had a very hard time and suffered a lot during the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866. The Prussian troops were marching from [[Moravia]] towards [[Trnava]] and there were numerous fights going on. A great number of the dead were not buried which resulted in [[cholera]] being spread gradually all around [[Z\u00e1horie]]. About 149 people died in Solo\u0161nica as a result of being infected with cholera from August 29 to November 14, 1866.\n\nIn the spring of 1909, there was a severe landslide in the land area called \"Na Jam\u00e1ch\" and \"N\u00ed\u017einy\". Another landslide also occurred in 1936.\n\n===World War I===\nWorld War I brought along plenty of hardship, suffering, and famine, as well as poverty for the local people. Around 180 men were gradually drafted from Solo\u0161nica and they fought on the [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|Serbian front]]. Some of them were reported missing and 43 men died while fighting on the front. In order to commemorate this significant event, a memorial was built in 1931 by the village with the help of the money collected among its inhabitants.<ref>http://www.solosnica.sk/o-obci/z-historie-obce/</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\nThere are two important historic landmarks located in the village:\n\n*'''All Saints Church'''\nDates back to the 14th century when it is considered to have originated. The new church was built on the foundations of the old one in 1699. It was dedicated to [[All Saints' Day]]. It was built in the [[baroque]] style. The church has been reconstructed and undergone various changes until now. The painting comes from the years between 1880-1890. \n*'''The sawmill left after Mr. Alexander Nottn\u00fd from 1880'''\nIn 1720 there was a mill in the village, in the 18th century there was a papermill widely used, in the 19th century a distillery was built and the manorial grange was established.<ref>http://www.solosnica.sk/o-obci/z-historie-obce</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Solosnicky potok.jpg|Stream Solo\u0161n\u00edck\u00fd potok\nFile:Haviaren.jpg|Cave Haviare\u0148\nFile:Rostun 02.jpg|Mount V\u00e1penn\u00e1\n</gallery>\n\n==Surrounding municipalities==\n{|\n|\n* [[Senica]]\n* [[Jablonica]]\n* [[Cerov\u00e1]]\n* [[Prievaly]]\n||\n|\n* [[Plaveck\u00fd Peter]]\n* [[Plaveck\u00fd Mikul\u00e1\u0161]]\n* [[Roho\u017en\u00edk, Malacky District|Roho\u017en\u00edk]]\n* [[Malacky]]\n||\n|\n* [[Kuchy\u0148a]]\n* [[Pernek]]\n\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[\u010cerven\u00fd Kame\u0148 Castle]]\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category-inline|Solo\u0161nica}}\n*[http://www.Solosnica.sk Solosnica.sk Home Page] {{in lang|sk}}\n*[http://www.statistics.sk/mosmis/eng/run.html Slovakia Urban and Municipal Statistics] {{in lang|sk}}\n*[http://www.solosnica.sk/o-obci/z-historie-obce History of Solosnica]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Malacky District}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Solosnica}}\n[[Category:Geography of Bratislava Region]]\n[[Category:Villages and municipalities in Malacky District]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Solo\u0161nica\n| native_name             = \n| other_name              = \n| settlement_type         = Municipality\n<!-- images, nickname, motto -->\n| image_skyline           = solosnica church 01.jpg\n| image_caption           = All Saints Catholic Church\n| image_flag              = Solosnica Flag.svg\n| image_shield            = Solosnica_coa.jpg\n| motto                   = \n| nickname                = \n| etymology               = \n<!-- location -->\n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = Slovakia\n| subdivision_type1       = \n| subdivision_name1       = \n| subdivision_type2       = Region\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Bratislava Region|Bratislava]]\n| subdivision_type3       = District\n| subdivision_name3       = [[Malacky District|Malacky]]\n| subdivision_type4       = \n| subdivision_name4       = \n<!-- maps and coordinates -->\n| image_map               = \n| map_caption             = \n| pushpin_map             = Slovakia Bratislava Region#Slovakia\n| pushpin_relief          = 1\n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location of Solo\u0161nica in the [[Bratislava Region]]\n| pushpin_label_position  = top\n| coordinates             = {{coord|48|27|43|N|17|14|8|E|display=inline,title}}\n| coordinates_footnotes   = \n<!-- government type, leaders -->\n| leader_title            = Mayor\n| leader_name             = [[Anna \u010cerm\u00e1kov\u00e1]]\n<!-- established -->\n| established_title       = First mentioned\n| established_date        = 1367\n<!-- area -->\n| area_footnotes          = \n| area_total_km2          = 41.91\n| area_total_sq_mi        = \n| area_land_sq_mi         = \n| area_water_sq_mi        = \n<!-- elevation -->\n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = 291\n| elevation_ft            = \n<!-- population -->\n| population_as_of        = 2008\n| population_footnotes    = \n| population_total        = 1559\n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_density_sq_mi=\n| population_demonym      = \n<!-- time zone(s) -->\n| timezone1               = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| utc_offset1             = +1\n| timezone1_DST           = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset1_DST         = +2\n<!-- postal codes, area code -->\n| postal_code_type        = Postal code\n| postal_code             = 906 37\n| area_code_type          =  \n| area_code               = 421-34\n| geocode                 = \n| iso_code                = \n<!-- website, footnotes -->\n| website                 = [http://www.solosnica.sk/]\n| footnotes               = \n}}\n\n'''Solo\u0161nica''' ({{lang-de|Breitenbrunn|links=no}}); is a village and [[municipality]] in western [[Slovakia]] in [[Malacky District]] in the [[Bratislava Region]].\n\n==Profile==\n[[Image:Zaruby from plavecke podhradie.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Little Carpathians around the [[Plaveck\u00fd hrad Castle]]]]\nSolo\u0161nica lies at the foot of the northwestern side of the Mal\u00e9 Karpaty ([[Little Carpathians]])Mountains at an altitude of 291 m above sea level.

The first name mentioned was ''Vicus Beda''. Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] expanded the settlement to a road castle around 330, the central part of which forms the town centre today. Bitburg is first documented only after the end of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman Empire]] around 715 as ''castrum bedense''. It subsequently became part of [[Franconia]].\n\nThe first mention of Bitburg in historic annals occurred in connection with the signing in 1239 of the Trier-Luxembourg Treaty between Archbishop Theoderich II of Trier and Countess Ermesinde II of Luxemburg, under which the town came under the archbishopric's protection. Bitburg received a town charter in 1262 from [[Henry V, Count of Luxembourg|Count Henry V of Luxembourg]].\n\nIn 1443, Bitburg came under the sway of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], then in 1506 was acquired by the [[Austrian Netherlands]], which controlled most of modern Belgium. In 1794 the city came under [[France|French]] administration, and in 1798 became part of the newly created ''[[D\u00e9partement des For\u00eats]]''. This led to a short lived economic upturn, and Bitburg received among other things a court and a land registry.\n\nIn 1815, under agreements at the [[Congress of Vienna]] following the final defeat of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], Bitburg was transferred to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], where until 1822 it belonged administratively to the province of Lower Rhine, and afterwards to the Rhine province. With the unification of Germany under Prussian dominance in 1871, Bitburg became part of the German Empire, and after World War I the [[Weimar Republic]] of Germany.\n[[File:Matzen Kriegerdenkmal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to soldiers of two world wars]]\nIn the interwar years, Bitburg, like most of the [[Eifel]] region, was impoverished and comparatively backward. Economic growth began after the [[Nazi Seizure of Power]] and the Nazi regime's introduction of employment-boosting public works projects, including infrastructure for war, particularly the [[Westwall]]; new armed forces barracks; and the development of the [[Kyll]] Valley railway. It is said that the building now used as the post office at Bitburg Annex (what is left of Bitburg Air Base) was the headquarters for [[Adolf Hitler]] when he was in the city.\n\nIn late December 1944, Bitburg was 85 percent destroyed by Allied bombing attacks, and later officially designated by the U.S. military as a \"dead city.\" Subsequently, the town was occupied by [[Luxembourg]] soldiers, who were replaced by French forces in 1955. \n\nIn 1952 a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]) base was opened at Bitburg by the U.S. Air Force. At the end of the 1980s, French troops were withdrawn and NATO took over the former French barracks. After the [[Gulf War|First Gulf War]] most of the USAF forces were moved to the larger [[Spangdahlem Air Base]], about 12 km east of Bitburg. In 1994, NATO turned the Bitburg Air Base over to the city, which devoted it to public works projects. The [[Kyll]] Valley railway was abandoned in the early 21st century, and part of it was converted into a bicycle path (''Radweg'').\n\nIn 1985, Bitburg came to international attention due to a ceremonial visit by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] to the nearby Kolmesh\u00f6he Military Cemetery \u2013 which among its 2,000 graves included those of 49 members of the [[Waffen-SS]] (see [[Bitburg controversy]]). Punk band the [[Ramones]] wrote the song [[Bonzo Goes to Bitburg]] in response to Ronald Reagan's trip.

According to the alleged victims, Craig would claim to be selling a used [[MacBook]] through his Twitter account. After accepting an online payment on average between [[USD|US$]]600 and $800 for the product from at least 16 individuals, Craig was reported to have discontinued communication with the buyers, and no MacBooks were ever distributed. He initially denied the accusations and claimed that his Twitter had been hacked and he had no involvement.<ref name=\"meb-breaking-story\"/> However, the following week it was announced that Craig had dropped off his current tour in Emarosa with Chiodos to enter [[drug detoxification|detox]] in order to treat his ongoing battles with [[heroin addiction]]. Rise Records and the Artery Foundation assumed financial responsibility for the internet scam and intend to reimburse anyone who had been victimized. [[Tilian Pearson]], formerly of [[Tides of Man]], substituted for Craig during his absence from [[Emarosa]].<ref name=\"altpress-rehab\"/> A public apology was issued after his detox treatment was completed on March 8, 2011.<ref name=\"altpress-apology\"/>\n\nIn October 2011, Craig was jailed for two counts of possession of narcotics, two counts of possession of drug paraphernalia, and one count of [[failure to appear]] on a felony charge with bail set at US$15,000. As a result of this incident, Dance Gavin Dance cancelled their upcoming tour and went on hiatus.<ref name=\"altpress-narcoticscharges\"/><ref name=\"noisecreep-arrested\"/> Craig was released from jail a few weeks later and was scheduled to enter a court-ordered rehabilitation facility. His follow-up hearing was scheduled for April 30, 2012.<ref name=\"altpress-jailrelease\"/> Dance Gavin Dance went on with their tour as planned but without Craig. He completed a 30-day court-ordered detox and was released March 30, 2012. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nOn April 2, 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2014/04/02/news/jonny-craig-slaves-etc-fends-off-new-drug-use-accusations |title=Jonny Craig (Slaves, Etc.)

Craig addressed the issue in a now-deleted video where he took a drug test on screen. He is quoted saying, \"just woke up to a nice surprise from the ex. So I'm headed right down to the office to prove to you guys without a doubt I'm not using and that those videos are old.

The [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Pechenegs]] settled the area in 12th century following attacks of the [[Cumans]]. [[Transylvanian Saxons]] settled the area in 1206 and called the region \"[[N\u00f6snerland]]\".{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} A large part of settlers were fugitives, convicts and poor people looking for lands and opportunities.<ref>K.

The town is given the right to be surrounded by defensive walls in 1409. In 1465, the city's fortifications had 18 defensive towers and [[bastion]]s defended by the local [[guild]]s. It was also defended by a ''Kirchenburg'', or fortified church. The town was badly damaged by fire five times between 1836 and 1850.<ref>[[Leslie S. Klinger]], ''The New Annotated Dracula'', W. W.

The Jews of Bistri\u021ba, as elsewhere in Hungary, were subjected to restrictions, and Jewish men of military age were drafted for [[Labour service (Hungary)|forced labor service]]. In May 1944, the Jewish population was forced into the [[Bistri\u021ba ghetto]], set up at Stamboli Farm, about two miles from the city. The ghetto consisted of a number of barracks and pigsties. At its peak, the ghetto held close to 6,000 Jews, including those brought in from the neighboring communities in [[Beszterce-Nasz\u00f3d]] County. Among these were the Jews of [[Borg\u00f3beszterce]], [[Borg\u00f3prund]], [[Galacfalva]], [[Kisilva]], [[Marosborg\u00f3]], [[Nagyilva]], [[Nagysaj\u00f3]], [[Nasz\u00f3d]], [[\u00d3radna]], and [[Romoly]].

It was significantly renovated after the 2008 fire which damaged the tower.\n* The Minorite Monastery, situated in the eastern side of the old town, close to the location of the former defensive walls, is one of the oldest buildings in Bistri\u021ba. Built between 1270 and 1280, the building has undergone several repairs and alterations, the first one being recorded in 1494. After 1541, when the Minorite order left the town, it served as a barn and wine cellar. In 1724, the Catholic Church returned to Bistri\u021ba and the church was reopened. In 1895, the [[Romanian Greek Catholic Church]] purchased the building for 35,000 florins. The church was turned into an Orthodox church in 1948, when the communist government dissolved the Romanian Greek Catholic Church and transferred its properties to the Romanian Orthodox Church, and was decorated in [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Neo-Byzantine]] style in 1978\u20131980.\n* The Bistri\u021ba-N\u0103s\u0103ud County Museum, located in a former [[barracks]], contains [[Thracians|Thracian]], [[Celts|Celt]]ic, and German artifacts.\n* The buildings of the city's two leading high schools, [[Andrei Mure\u0219anu National College (Bistri\u021ba)|Andrei Mure\u0219anu National College]] and [[Liviu Rebreanu National College]].\n\n==Popular culture==\nIn [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]'', the character [[Jonathan Harker]] visits Bistri\u021ba (rendered as \"Bistritz\", the German name for the city, in the original text) and stays at the Golden Krone Hotel ({{lang-ro|Coroana de Aur}}); although no such hotel existed when the novel was written, a hotel of the same name has since been built.\n\nIn the [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[Shadow Hearts]]'', Bistri\u021ba (where it is spelled \"Biztritz\") was a major place and home to the role-playing character Keith Valentine.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe major cities directly linked by trains to this city are [[Bucharest]] via a night train, and [[Cluj-Napoca]] via several trains.

The town is given the right to be surrounded by defensive walls in 1409. In 1465, the city's fortifications had 18 defensive towers and [[bastion]]s defended by the local [[guild]]s. It was also defended by a ''Kirchenburg'', or fortified church. The town was badly damaged by fire five times between 1836 and 1850.<ref>[[Leslie S. Klinger]], ''The New Annotated Dracula'', W. W.

It was significantly renovated after the 2008 fire which damaged the tower.\n* The Minorite Monastery, situated in the eastern side of the old town, close to the location of the former defensive walls, is one of the oldest buildings in Bistri\u021ba. Built between 1270 and 1280, the building has undergone several repairs and alterations, the first one being recorded in 1494. After 1541, when the Minorite order left the town, it served as a barn and wine cellar. In 1724, the Catholic Church returned to Bistri\u021ba and the church was reopened. In 1895, the [[Romanian Greek Catholic Church]] purchased the building for 35,000 florins. The church was turned into an Orthodox church in 1948, when the communist government dissolved the Romanian Greek Catholic Church and transferred its properties to the Romanian Orthodox Church, and was decorated in [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Neo-Byzantine]] style in 1978-1980.\n* The Bistri\u021ba-N\u0103s\u0103ud County Museum, located in a former [[barracks]], contains [[Thracians|Thracian]], [[Celts|Celt]]ic, and German artifacts.\n* The buildings of the city's two leading high schools, [[Andrei Mure\u0219anu National College (Bistri\u021ba)|Andrei Mure\u0219anu National College]] and [[Liviu Rebreanu National College]].\n\n==Popular culture==\nIn [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]'', the character [[Jonathan Harker]] visits Bistri\u021ba (rendered as \"Bistritz\", the German name for the city, in the original text) and stays at the Golden Krone Hotel ({{lang-ro|Coroana de Aur}}); although no such hotel existed when the novel was written, a hotel of the same name has since been built.\n\nIn the [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[Shadow Hearts]]'', Bistri\u021ba (where it is spelled \"Biztritz\") was a major place and home to the role-playing character Keith Valentine.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe major cities directly linked by trains to this city are [[Bucharest]] via a night train, and [[Cluj-Napoca]] via several trains.

He first appeared in the series on 18 October 1994, and became ''EastEnders''{{'}} longest-serving pet, before being killed off on 15 August 2008. Although the character is male, he has been played primarily by three female dogs: Zenna, her daughter Chancer, and her granddaughter Kyte. A fourth dog briefly served as a replacement for Zenna in 1996, when she was given time off from the show to have a litter of puppies.\n\nWellard was briefly written out of the series under executive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]], but returned when Robinson was succeeded by [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]]. Wellard's owners for the majority of his duration in the soap were [[Robbie Jackson]] and [[Gus Smith]]. He was voted \"Best Pet\" at the 2008 [[Digital Spy Soap Awards]], and named the UK's favourite soap opera pet in a 2009 ''[[Inside Soap]]'' poll. Wellard was a fan favourite, and although a storyline that saw him threatened with euthanasia for biting local caf\u00e9 owner [[Ian Beale]] was poorly received by critics, his death drew generally favourable reviews.\n\n==Storylines==\nIn November 1994, [[Walford]] resident [[Robbie Jackson]] ([[Dean Gaffney]]) takes in a dog he assumes to be a stray, naming him Wellard. The dog's owner, Mr Hammond, locates him and demands him back, but Wellard later returns to [[Albert Square]] of his own accord. Robbie realises he has been mistreated and has run away. Mr Hammond admits to neglecting Wellard, and allows Robbie to keep him. Wellard fathers puppies with [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) and [[Nigel Bates]]'s ([[Paul Bradley (British actor)|Paul Bradley]]) [[greyhound]], Frieda; however, the puppies are [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. When Robbie begins a relationship with a woman allergic to dogs, she gives him the ultimatum of choosing between her and Wellard: Robbie chooses Wellard. Several years later, when Robbie is due to leave Walford to live in [[India]], Wellard is run over, delaying Robbie's departure. He is cared for by Robbie's sister [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), who gives him to her friend [[Gus Smith|Gus]] ([[Mohammed George]]) after Robbie's departure. When Gus is involved in a minibus crash, Wellard is able to save his owner by leading him to a spot from where he can call the emergency services.\n\nWellard is reported to the police when he bites local caf\u00e9 owner [[Ian Beale]] on the buttocks. He is taken away, with the possibility that he will be [[animal euthanasia|euthanised]], but Gus and [[Deano Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) launch a campaign to save him, under the moniker \"Walford One Owed Freedom\" (WOOF). When Wellard is put on trial, Ian's partner [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) presents character witness statements for the dog, written by Ian's children, [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]) and [[Peter Beale|Peter]] ([[Thomas Law]]). Wellard is found guilty, but as a result of the statements, Gus is allowed to take him home as long as he keeps him on a lead at all times. When Gus leaves Walford to travel with his girlfriend [[List of EastEnders characters (2008)#Others|Keisha]] (Suzie McGrath), he leaves Wellard with his friend [[Mickey Miller]] ([[Joe Swash]]). Mickey sells Wellard to [[Vinnie Monks]] ([[Bobby Davro]]), who intends to give him to his girlfriend [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]). When it transpires Shirley does not want him, Vinnie gives Wellard to the [[Branning family|Jackson family]]. [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) feeds Wellard a chocolate, causing him to suffer from [[theobromine poisoning]]. He has to be euthanised, is [[cremation|cremated]], and has his ashes scattered on the local allotment.<ref name=\"Mirror\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2008/08/05/eastenders-dog-wellard-to-be-killed-off-115875-20684626/|title=EastEnders dog Wellard to be killed off |last=Wallis|first=Sarah|date=5 August 2008|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/entertainment/newsid_7542000/7542361.stm|title= End for EastEnders dog Wellard|date=5 August 2008|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nWellard's name is a [[portmanteau]] of \"well hard\", meaning \"very tough\".<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7475039.stm|title=Soap dog Wellard to be killed off|date=26 June 2008|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref> The character was originally played by a Belgian Shepherd (Tervuren) named Zenna, who was cast at the age of one.

He first appeared in the series on 18 October 1994, and became ''EastEnders''{{'}} longest-serving pet, before being killed off on 15 August 2008. Although the character is male, he has been played primarily by three female dogs: Zenna, her daughter Chancer, and her granddaughter Kyte. A fourth dog briefly served as a replacement for Zenna in 1996, when she was given time off from the show to have a litter of puppies.\n\nWellard was briefly written out of the series under executive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]], but returned when Robinson was succeeded by [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]]. Wellard's owners for the majority of his duration in the soap were [[Robbie Jackson]] and [[Gus Smith]]. He was voted \"Best Pet\" at the 2008 [[Digital Spy Soap Awards]], and named the UK's favourite soap opera pet in a 2009 ''[[Inside Soap]]'' poll. Wellard was a fan favourite, and although a storyline that saw him threatened with euthanasia for biting local caf\u00e9 owner [[Ian Beale]] was poorly received by critics, his death drew generally favourable reviews.\n\n==Storylines==\nIn November 1994, [[Walford]] resident [[Robbie Jackson]] ([[Dean Gaffney]]) takes in a dog he assumes to be a stray, naming him Wellard. The dog's owner, Mr Hammond, locates him and demands him back, but Wellard later returns to [[Albert Square]] of his own accord. Robbie realises he has been mistreated and has run away. Mr Hammond admits to neglecting Wellard, and allows Robbie to keep him. Wellard fathers puppies with [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) and [[Nigel Bates]]'s ([[Paul Bradley (British actor)|Paul Bradley]]) [[greyhound]], Frieda; however, the puppies are [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. When Robbie begins a relationship with a woman allergic to dogs, she gives him the ultimatum of choosing between her and Wellard: Robbie chooses Wellard. Several years later, when Robbie is due to leave Walford to live in [[India]], Wellard is run over, delaying Robbie's departure. He is cared for by Robbie's sister [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), who gives him to her friend [[Gus Smith|Gus]] ([[Mohammed George]]) after Robbie's departure. When Gus is involved in a minibus crash, Wellard is able to save his owner by leading him to a spot from where he can call the emergency services.\n\nWellard is reported to the police when he bites local caf\u00e9 owner [[Ian Beale]] on the buttocks. He is taken away, with the possibility that he will be [[animal euthanasia|euthanised]], but Gus and [[Deano Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) launch a campaign to save him, under the moniker \"Walford One Owed Freedom\" (WOOF). When Wellard is put on trial, Ian's partner [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) presents character witness statements for the dog, written by Ian's children, [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]) and [[Peter Beale|Peter]] ([[Thomas Law]]). Wellard is found guilty, but as a result of the statements, Gus is allowed to take him home as long as he keeps him on a lead at all times. When Gus leaves Walford to travel with his girlfriend [[List of EastEnders characters (2008)#Others|Keisha]] (Suzie McGrath), he leaves Wellard with his friend [[Mickey Miller]] ([[Joe Swash]]). Mickey sells Wellard to [[Vinnie Monks]] ([[Bobby Davro]]), who intends to give him to his girlfriend [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]). When it transpires Shirley does not want him, Vinnie gives Wellard to the [[Branning family|Jackson family]]. [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) feeds Wellard a chocolate, causing him to suffer from [[theobromine poisoning]]. He has to be euthanised, is [[cremation|cremated]], and has his ashes scattered on the local allotment.<ref name=\"Mirror\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2008/08/05/eastenders-dog-wellard-to-be-killed-off-115875-20684626/|title=EastEnders dog Wellard to be killed off |last=Wallis|first=Sarah|date=5 August 2008|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/entertainment/newsid_7542000/7542361.stm|title= End for EastEnders dog Wellard|date=5 August 2008|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nWellard's name is a [[portmanteau]] of \"well hard\", meaning \"very tough\".<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7475039.stm|title=Soap dog Wellard to be killed off|date=26 June 2008|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref> The character was originally played by a Belgian Shepherd (Tervuren) named Zenna, who was cast at the age of one.

The [[United States Public Health Service]] (USPHS) was named the supervisory agency; it was answerable to the [[Surgeon General of the United States|surgeon general of the United States]], [[Thomas Parran, Jr.]] The USPHS established a division to administer the CNC program and Parran appointed [[Lucile Petry Leone|Lucile Petry]], a [[registered nurse]] (RN), as its director.\n\nThe program was open to all women between the ages of 17 and 35 who were in good health and had graduated from an accredited [[School|high-school]]. The recruiting target was the high-school graduate but [[college]] women were also recruited. Nearly every type of media source advertised for the CNC. All state nursing schools in the U.S. were eligible to participate in the program; they were, however, required to be accredited by the accrediting agency in their state and be connected with a hospital that had been approved by the [[American College of Surgeons]]. The participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional 36-month nursing program into 30 months and were obligated to provide the students with clinical experiences of [[medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]], and [[obstetrics]].\n\nThe cadets came from locations across the nation and from all backgrounds. The CNC was the largest of the federal nurse-training programs; it allowed young women to serve their country in uniform while being protected by law against discrimination. Of the 1,300 schools of nursing in the country, 1,125 participated in the program. The CNC operated from 1943 until 1948; during this period 179,294 student nurses enrolled in the program and 124,065 of them graduated from participating nursing schools. The [[American Hospital Association]] credited the cadet student nurses with helping to prevent the collapse of civilian nursing in the U.S. during the war.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe U.S. experienced a shortage of nurses long before its entry into World War II; this shortage worsened with the prewar buildup of the military and industrial upturn that this caused.<ref>Robinson p. 27</ref> Professional nursing groups were unprepared to deal with the problem. On 10 July 1940, however, the situation changed when Isabel M. Stewart, professor of nursing at [[Columbia University]] and a member of the [[National League for Nursing]], wrote to its president: \"I believe we should have a committee or board that is representative of the nursing profession as a whole and it should be at work now&nbsp;...\".<ref> U.S. Public Health Service p. 2</ref>  Within three weeks, on 29 July 1940, representatives of the national nursing community gathered in New York City under the umbrella of the [[American Nurses Association]], where they formed the Nursing Council on National Defense.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 3</ref> In its first order of business, the council concentrated on surveying nursing resources and securing federal funding to expand nursing educational opportunities.<ref name=\"Robinson p. 29\">Robinson p. 29</ref>\n\nThe survey results indicated 100,000 nurses were eligible for the military service and that most nursing schools were ill-equipped to enlarge their instructional or housing facilities.<ref>Robinson p. 30</ref> The council submitted its federal aid request for [[Fiscal Year|fiscal year]] 1 July 1941 to 30 June 1942 to the [[U.S. Commissioner of Education|U.S. commissioner of education]], who approved it and moved it on to the [[Bureau of the Budget]].<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 8</ref> The Congress enacted and funded the Nurse Training Program, which assisted in the education of 12,000 students at 309 nursing schools. Through the program, 3,800 inactive nurses received refresher courses and 4,800 graduate nurses received postgraduate training. By the end of the fiscal year, 47,500 students were enrolled in nursing schools but this did not meet the country's demands. Nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep pace with the country\u2019s civilian and military needs. \n<ref>Robinson p. 34</ref>\n\nDuring 1942, the [[Office of War Information]] tried to mobilize interest in the nursing profession using prime-time radio advertisements: saturating broadcasts with interviews, dramatic sketches, and spot announcements urging young women to join the nursing profession. While these efforts were helpful, they did not meet expectations.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 12</ref> The supporters of the nurse training programs recommended doubling federal aid for basic nursing education in the fiscal year ending 30 June 1943. Representative [[Frances P. Bolton]] of Ohio, a longtime advocate of nursing, supported the proposed increase in federal aid, advising the Congress that further aid requests for the nurse training programs were likely.<ref>Robinson p. 35</ref>\n\n==Creation of the program==\n[[File:Lucile Petry Leone.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The female head of the Cadet Nurse Corps seated in civilian clothing|Lucile Petry (RN) was the director of the Cadet Nurse Corps from 1943 to 1948]]\n\nBolton took the initiative and introduced H.R. 2326, a [[Bill (law)|bill]] to create and fund a training program for nurses, on 29 March 1943. The Senate added an amendment that prohibited discrimination based upon race, color, or creed. At the bill's legislative hearings, hospital groups explained how distressed nursing care in civilian hospitals had become. Support for the bill also came in the form of letters and telegrams. The bill passed both houses of the Congress by unanimous vote on 15 June 1943 and became Public Law 74 on 1 July 1943; with the title of Nurse Training Act of 1943 but commonly referred to as the Bolton act. It provided for the training of nurses for the armed forces, government and civilian hospitals, health agencies, and war industries through grants to the institutions providing the training.<ref>Perry and Robinson p. 5</ref>{{#tag:ref| In ''G. I. Nightingales'', Barbara Tomblin describes how the CNC became a new program: \"The decision to create a new program rather than to reinstitute the old Army School of Nursing was a sharp break with Army Nurse Corps tradition. However, the Congress and the Army felt it would be more efficient and economical to use existing civilian nursing schools and facilities than to create a military structure to provide more graduate nurses&nbsp;...&#32;\".<ref>Tomblin p. 190</ref>|group=Note}} It also contained a provision requiring that those trained under the act would comprise a uniformed body,<ref>Robinson p. 41</ref> although they were not a part of any U.S. military service.<ref>Szecsy p. 10</ref>\n\nThe Division of Nurse Education was established in the USPHS to supervise the program; it was answerable to the surgeon general of the United States, [[Thomas Parran Jr.]] He appointed [[Lucile Petry Leone|Lucile Petry]], a [[registered nurse]] (RN), as the director.<ref name=\"Perry and Robinson p. 7\">Perry and Robinson p. 7</ref> The [[Federal Security Agency|federal security administrator]] was required to appoint an advisory committee to assist in guiding the nurse-training programs. The committee consisted of people in the nursing and related fields, who were drawn from various parts of the country.{{#tag:ref|Advisory committee:\n*Isabel M.

As required, they were approved by the surgeon general and published in the ''[[Federal Register]]''.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p.&nbsp;21</ref>\n\nThe surgeon general then sent a telegram outlining the program to 1,300 nursing schools in the United States and Puerto Rico. This was followed up with applications and instructions sent by mail. [[Hawaii]]'s two nursing schools were not eligible for the program because they were in a war zone and [[Alaska]] had no nursing schools at the time.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service pp. 23\u201324</ref>\nThe regulations required interested nursing schools to:\n*be state accredited; \n*be connected with a hospital approved by the [[American College of Surgeons]] or a hospital of equal standards; \n*maintain adequate instructional facilities and personnel; \n*provide adequate clinical experience in four basic services\u2014medicine, surgery, [[pediatrics]], and [[obstetrics]]; \n*provide maintenance and a [[stipend]] of $30.00 for all senior cadet nurses, or arrange for their requested transfer to federal or other hospitals (a student nurse became a senior cadet in the last six months before graduation);\n* provide satisfactory living facilities and an adequate health service for students; \n*provide for an accelerated program; and \n*restrict its hours of practice.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 23</ref>  \nThe standards of the National League for Nursing were adopted to evaluate the participating schools.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service pp. 23\u201324</ref> After issuing these regulations, the surgeon general said; \"The schools of nursing are free to select students, to plan curricula, and to formulate policies consistent with the Act and the traditions of the institution concerned.

Marriage was permissible subject to individual nursing school guidelines. Successful applicants were eligible for a government subsidy that paid for tuition, books, uniforms, and a stipend. In exchange, student cadets were required to pledge{{#tag:ref|The CNC pledge: \n:\"I am solemnly aware of the obligations I assume toward my country and toward my chosen profession, I will follow faithfully the teachings of my instructors and the guidance of the physicians with whom I work.

Of the 1,300 nursing schools in the country, 1,125 participated.\nFor this program, the traditional 36-month nurse training was accelerated to 30 months. Senior nursing students were required to work for a six-month period in a hospital or in another health agency. In return, the federal government would pay the schools for the related tuition and fees of the students.<ref>Robinson pp. 41\u201342</ref>\n\nThe committee was also responsible for naming the new program. The Victory Nurse Corps and the Student War Nursing Reserve were considered but both were rejected in favor of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps (CNC).<ref>Perry and Robinson p. 6</ref>\n\n==Housing==\nIn its 1940 survey, the Nursing Council on National Defense reported that most of the nursing schools in the U.S. were ill-equipped to enlarge their housing and classroom facilities.<ref name=\"Robinson p. 29\"/> In the following two fiscal years, federal aid was provided to nursing schools for nurse training but it did not provide any aid for housing facilities.<ref name=\"U.S. Public Health Service p. 10\">U.S. Public Health Service p. 10</ref> Even with the passage of the Nurse Training Act of 1943, the problem remained. Some schools were able to rent or purchase additional buildings; those that could not requested assistance from the federal government. Without funds for physical facilities, the USPHS arranged with the Federal Works Agency to allow nursing schools to share in some of the construction funds provided under the National Defense Act of 1940. The two federal agencies agreed the need for housing and other facilities in nursing schools would be based on school participation in the CNC program. The Federal Works Agency would decide where, how, and to whom the aid would be granted.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 52</ref>\n\nUnder the agreement, the schools of nursing that could not otherwise accommodate classes would receive a share of the federal aid for housing. It would include aid for living quarters, library space, classrooms, and demonstration rooms. The amount allocated for construction projects was $25,657.785. The Federal Works Agency projects started in September 1943 and ended in November 1944; during this period, about 400 applications consisting of 160 for training facilities, 172 for construction, and 68 for the purchase, lease, or renovation of existing buildings, were cleared. Nursing schools in all but nine states were helped by the federal aid; the arrangement called for the nursing schools to share in the cost of the projects. Of the $25,657.785 spent on the nursing school projects, federal aid paid $17,397.002 (about 67.8 percent) and the nursing schools paid $8,260.783 (about 32.2 percent).<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 53</ref>\n\n== Recruitment ==\nThe USPHS recruiting campaign was aimed at reaching the maximum number of potential applicants in the shortest period of time.<ref name=\"U.S. Public Health Service p. 26\">U.S. Public Health Service p. 26</ref> The primary target was the high-school graduate but [[college]] women were also recruited.<ref name=\"U.S. Public Health Service p. 31\">U.S. Public Health Service p. 31</ref> The selling point was free education in a proud profession while providing an essential service to the country.<ref name=\"U.S. Public Health Service p. 30\" /> Appeals to join the CNC reached more than 7,000,000 newspaper and magazine readers, and millions of radio listeners and movie patrons around the country.

There was one uniform for winter and another for summer. The winter uniform was a gray, woolen, single-breasted jacket suit, a [[Gore (fabrics)|gored]] skirt, and a gray, [[velour]] overcoat. A gray Montgomery beret, similar to the one worn by the British officer, General [[Bernard Montgomery]], was worn with both of the uniforms.

The students became senior cadets in their last six months before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital, where they provided the equivalent services to those of a graduate nurse. During their first nine months of training, cadets were protected by regulation from working on the hospital wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes; senior cadets were free of classes. All state boards of nursing modified their regulations to agree with the accelerated program.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service pp. 40\u201341</ref>\n\nThe quality and standards of the educational systems in which cadets would be trained varied considerably. In 1943, nursing schools, hospital administrators, and government officials assured the U.S. Congress the federally subsidized training of nurses would conform to the minimum standards.<ref name=PHSp46>U.S. Public Health Service p. 46</ref> With his rule-making powers, the surgeon general issued these regulations:<blockquote>\n*The school had to be accredited by the appropriate accrediting agency for schools of nursing in the state or territory; \n*An institution offering a degree in nursing had to be accredited by the appropriate accrediting agency for universities and colleges.\n*The school had to be connected with a hospital that had been approved by the American College of Surgeons, or that maintained standards of nursing equivalent to those required by the college. In a central school of nursing, the major hospital clinical unit had to meet these standards.\n*The school had to require for admission not less than graduation from an accredited high-school; \n*The school had to maintain an educational staff adequate to provide satisfactory instruction and supervision; \n*Its curriculum had to include all those units of instruction necessary to conform with accepted practices in basic nursing education.  \n*The school had to provide adequate clinical experience in the four basic services \u2013 medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and obstetrics; \n*The school had to provide well-balanced weekly schedules of organized instruction, experience and study; \n*The school had to provide adequate and well-equipped class rooms, laboratories, libraries, and other necessary facilities for carrying out the program, and satisfactory living facilities and health service for students.\n*In evaluating the adequacy of the school facilities to meet the various requirements specified, the standards of the National League of Nursing Education were to be used as a guide.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service pp. 46\u201347</ref> </blockquote>\n\nCongressional hearings on appropriations stressed all schools should be allowed to take part in the program.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 47</ref> When the standards were applied against the existing conditions, they did not seem practical for some schools to achieve. Some accommodations were made for smaller schools by lowering the standards for them. They would be judged by criteria that included the qualifications and number of instructional personnel, their clinical facilities, the curricula, the weekly schedule of hours, and the health and guidance programs. Such schools produced a small percentage of the cadet force.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 48</ref> While monitoring the standards of the 1,125 approved schools of nursing, the consultants of the Division of Nurse Education traveled thousands of miles, wrote countless letters, and provided direct and specific support services. The consultants were assigned to an area and each school was well-known to them.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 51</ref>\n\nThe CNC program began on 1 July 1943 and ended with the last group of graduating students on 31 December 1948<ref>Szecsy p. 16</ref>and included three enrollment periods; the first term was in 1943, the second in 1944, and the third and final term was in 1945. During this time, 179,294 students enrolled in the program<ref>Roinson p. 68</ref> and 124,065 of them graduated from the participating nursing schools<ref>Robinson p. 227</ref> and became registered nurses.<ref>Szecsy p. 20</ref> The main cause of the withdrawals was homesickness; some married students withdrew to be with their husbands when they were released from the military; others when the hostilities ceased; some failed in their studies; others left for health reasons; and some left because of the stress of a nursing career.<ref name=\"U.S. Public Health Service p. 38\"/>\n\nThe CNC was the largest of the federal nurse training programs.<ref name=\"Perry and Robinson p. 196\">Perry and Robinson p. 196</ref> The federal government spent $160,326,237 on the Nurse Training Act of 1943 for administration, uniforms, maintenance, tuition, fees, and stipends.

The [[United States Public Health Service]] (USPHS) was named the supervisory agency; it was answerable to the [[Surgeon General of the United States|surgeon general of the United States]], [[Thomas Parran, Jr.]] The USPHS established a division to administer the CNC program and Parran appointed [[Lucile Petry Leone|Lucile Petry]], a [[registered nurse]] (RN), as its director.\n\nThe program was open to all women between the ages of 17 and 35 who were in good health and had graduated from an accredited [[School|high-school]]. The recruiting target was the high-school graduate but [[college]] women were also recruited. Nearly every type of media source advertised for the CNC. All state nursing schools in the U.S. were eligible to participate in the program; they were, however, required to be accredited by the accrediting agency in their state and be connected with a hospital that had been approved by the [[American College of Surgeons]]. The participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional 36-month nursing program into 30 months and were obligated to provide the students with clinical experiences of [[medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]], and [[obstetrics]].\n\nThe cadets came from locations across the nation and from all backgrounds. The CNC was the largest of the federal nurse-training programs; it allowed young women to serve their country in uniform while being protected by law against discrimination. Of the 1,300 schools of nursing in the country, 1,125 participated in the program. The CNC operated from 1943 until 1948; during this period 179,294 student nurses enrolled in the program and 124,065 of them graduated from participating nursing schools. The [[American Hospital Association]] credited the cadet student nurses with helping to prevent the collapse of civilian nursing in the U.S. during the war.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe U.S. experienced a shortage of nurses long before its entry into World War II; this shortage worsened with the prewar buildup of the military and industrial upturn that this caused.<ref>Robinson p. 27</ref> Professional nursing groups were unprepared to deal with the problem. On 10 July 1940, however, the situation changed when Isabel M. Stewart, professor of nursing at [[Columbia University]] and a member of the [[National League for Nursing]], wrote to its president: \"I believe we should have a committee or board that is representative of the nursing profession as a whole and it should be at work now&nbsp;...\".<ref> U.S. Public Health Service p. 2</ref>  Within three weeks, on 29 July 1940, representatives of the national nursing community gathered in New York City under the umbrella of the [[American Nurses Association]], where they formed the Nursing Council on National Defense.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 3</ref> In its first order of business, the council concentrated on surveying nursing resources and securing federal funding to expand nursing educational opportunities.<ref name=\"Robinson p. 29\">Robinson p. 29</ref>\n\nThe survey results indicated 100,000 nurses were eligible for the military service and that most nursing schools were ill-equipped to enlarge their instructional or housing facilities.<ref>Robinson p. 30</ref> The council submitted its federal aid request for [[Fiscal Year|fiscal year]] 1 July 1941 to 30 June 1942 to the [[U.S. Commissioner of Education|U.S. commissioner of education]], who approved it and moved it on to the [[Bureau of the Budget]].<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 8</ref> The Congress enacted and funded the Nurse Training Program, which assisted in the education of 12,000 students at 309 nursing schools. Through the program, 3,800 inactive nurses received refresher courses and 4,800 graduate nurses received postgraduate training. By the end of the fiscal year, 47,500 students were enrolled in nursing schools but this did not meet the country's demands. Nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep pace with the country\u2019s civilian and military needs. \n<ref>Robinson p. 34</ref>\n\nDuring 1942, the [[Office of War Information]] tried to mobilize interest in the nursing profession using prime-time radio advertisements: saturating broadcasts with interviews, dramatic sketches, and spot announcements urging young women to join the nursing profession. While these efforts were helpful, they did not meet expectations.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 12</ref> The supporters of the nurse training programs recommended doubling federal aid for basic nursing education in the fiscal year ending 30 June 1943. Representative [[Frances P. Bolton]] of Ohio, a longtime advocate of nursing, supported the proposed increase in federal aid, advising the Congress that further aid requests for the nurse training programs were likely.<ref>Robinson p. 35</ref>\n\n==Creation of the program==\n[[File:Lucile Petry Leone.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The female head of the Cadet Nurse Corps seated in civilian clothing|Lucile Petry (RN) was the director of the Cadet Nurse Corps from 1943 to 1948]]\n\nBolton took the initiative and introduced H.R. 2326, a [[Bill (law)|bill]] to create and fund a training program for nurses, on 29 March 1943. The Senate added an amendment that prohibited discrimination based upon race, color, or creed. At the bill's legislative hearings, hospital groups explained how distressed nursing care in civilian hospitals had become. Support for the bill also came in the form of letters and telegrams. The bill passed both houses of the Congress by unanimous vote on 15 June 1943 and became Public Law 74 on 1 July 1943; with the title of Nurse Training Act of 1943 but commonly referred to as the Bolton act. It provided for the training of nurses for the armed forces, government and civilian hospitals, health agencies, and war industries through grants to the institutions providing the training.<ref>Perry and Robinson p. 5</ref>{{#tag:ref| In ''G. I. Nightingales'', Barbara Tomblin describes how the CNC became a new program: \"The decision to create a new program rather than to reinstitute the old Army School of Nursing was a sharp break with Army Nurse Corps tradition.

Marriage was permissible subject to individual nursing school guidelines. Successful applicants were eligible for a government subsidy that paid for tuition, books, uniforms, and a stipend.

Of the 1,300 nursing schools in the country, 1,125 participated.\nFor this program, the traditional 36-month nurse training was accelerated to 30 months. Senior nursing students were required to work for a six-month period in a hospital or in another health agency. In return, the federal government would pay the schools for the related tuition and fees of the students.<ref>Robinson pp. 41\u201342</ref>\n\nThe committee was also responsible for naming the new program. The Victory Nurse Corps and the Student War Nursing Reserve were considered but both were rejected in favor of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps (CNC).<ref>Perry and Robinson p. 6</ref>\n\n==Housing==\nIn its 1940 survey, the Nursing Council on National Defense reported that most of the nursing schools in the U.S. were ill-equipped to enlarge their housing and classroom facilities.<ref name=\"Robinson p. 29\"/> In the following two fiscal years, federal aid was provided to nursing schools for nurse training but it did not provide any aid for housing facilities.<ref name=\"U.S. Public Health Service p. 10\">U.S. Public Health Service p. 10</ref> Even with the passage of the Nurse Training Act of 1943, the problem remained. Some schools were able to rent or purchase additional buildings; those that could not requested assistance from the federal government. Without funds for physical facilities, the USPHS arranged with the Federal Works Agency to allow nursing schools to share in some of the construction funds provided under the National Defense Act of 1940. The two federal agencies agreed the need for housing and other facilities in nursing schools would be based on school participation in the CNC program. The Federal Works Agency would decide where, how, and to whom the aid would be granted.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 52</ref>\n\nUnder the agreement, the schools of nursing that could not otherwise accommodate classes would receive a share of the federal aid for housing. It would include aid for living quarters, library space, classrooms, and demonstration rooms. The amount allocated for construction projects was $25,657.785. The Federal Works Agency projects started in September 1943 and ended in November 1944; during this period, about 400 applications consisting of 160 for training facilities, 172 for construction, and 68 for the purchase, lease, or renovation of existing buildings, were cleared. Nursing schools in all but nine states were helped by the federal aid; the arrangement called for the nursing schools to share in the cost of the projects. Of the $25,657.785 spent on the nursing school projects, federal aid paid $17,397.002 (about 67.8 percent) and the nursing schools paid $8,260.783 (about 32.2 percent).<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 53</ref>\n\n== Recruitment ==\nThe USPHS recruiting campaign was aimed at reaching the maximum number of potential applicants in the shortest period of time.<ref name=\"U.S. Public Health Service p. 26\">U.S. Public Health Service p. 26</ref> The primary target was the high-school graduate but [[college]] women were also recruited.<ref name=\"U.S. Public Health Service p. 31\">U.S. Public Health Service p. 31</ref> The selling point was free education in a proud profession while providing an essential service to the country.<ref name=\"U.S. Public Health Service p. 30\" /> Appeals to join the CNC reached more than 7,000,000 newspaper and magazine readers, and millions of radio listeners and movie patrons around the country.

There was one uniform for winter and another for summer. The winter uniform was a gray, woolen, single-breasted jacket suit, a [[Gore (fabrics)|gored]] skirt, and a gray, [[velour]] overcoat. A gray Montgomery beret, similar to the one worn by the British officer, General [[Bernard Montgomery]], was worn with both of the uniforms.

The students became senior cadets in their last six months before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital, where they provided the full-time equivalent services to those of a graduate nurse. During their first nine months of training, cadets were protected by regulation from working on the hospital wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes; senior cadets were free of classes. All state boards of nursing modified their regulations to agree with the accelerated program.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service pp. 40\u201341</ref>\n\nThe quality and standards of the educational systems in which cadets would be trained varied considerably. In 1943, nursing schools, hospital administrators, and government officials assured the U.S. Congress the federally subsidized training of nurses would conform to the minimum standards.<ref name=PHSp46>U.S. Public Health Service p. 46</ref> With his rule-making powers, the surgeon general issued these regulations:<blockquote>\n*The school had to be accredited by the appropriate accrediting agency for schools of nursing in the state or territory; \n*An institution offering a degree in nursing had to be accredited by the appropriate accrediting agency for universities and colleges.\n*The school had to be connected with a hospital that had been approved by the American College of Surgeons, or that maintained standards of nursing equivalent to those required by the college. In a central school of nursing, the major hospital clinical unit had to meet these standards.\n*The school had to require for admission not less than graduation from an accredited high-school; \n*The school had to maintain an educational staff adequate to provide satisfactory instruction and supervision; \n*Its curriculum had to include all those units of instruction necessary to conform with accepted practices in basic nursing education.  \n*The school had to provide adequate clinical experience in the four basic services \u2013 medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and obstetrics; \n*The school had to provide well-balanced weekly schedules of organized instruction, experience and study; \n*The school had to provide adequate and well-equipped class rooms, laboratories, libraries, and other necessary facilities for carrying out the program, and satisfactory living facilities and health service for students.\n*In evaluating the adequacy of the school facilities to meet the various requirements specified, the standards of the National League of Nursing Education were to be used as a guide.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service pp. 46\u201347</ref> </blockquote>\n\nCongressional hearings on appropriations stressed all schools should be allowed to take part in the program.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 47</ref> When the standards were applied against the existing conditions, they did not seem practical for some schools to achieve. Some accommodations were made for smaller schools by lowering the standards for them. They would be judged by criteria that included the qualifications and number of instructional personnel, their clinical facilities, the curricula, the weekly schedule of hours, and the health and guidance programs. Such schools produced a small percentage of the cadet force.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 48</ref> While monitoring the standards of the 1,125 approved schools of nursing, the consultants of the Division of Nurse Education traveled thousands of miles, wrote countless letters, and provided direct and specific support services. The consultants were assigned to an area and each school was well-known to them.<ref>U.S. Public Health Service p. 51</ref>\n\nThe CNC program began on 1 July 1943 and ended with the last group of graduating students on 31 December 1948<ref>Szecsy p. 16</ref>and included three enrollment periods; the first term was in 1943, the second in 1944, and the third and final term was in 1945. During this time, 179,294 students enrolled in the program<ref>Roinson p. 68</ref> and 124,065 of them graduated from the participating nursing schools<ref>Robinson p. 227</ref> and became registered nurses.<ref>Szecsy p. 20</ref> The main cause of the withdrawals was homesickness; some married students withdrew to be with their husbands when they were released from the military; others when the hostilities ceased; some failed in their studies; others left for health reasons; and some left because of the stress of a nursing career.<ref name=\"U.S. Public Health Service p. 38\"/>\n\nThe CNC was the largest of the federal nurse training programs.<ref name=\"Perry and Robinson p. 196\">Perry and Robinson p. 196</ref> The federal government spent $160,326,237 on the Nurse Training Act of 1943 for administration, uniforms, maintenance, tuition, fees, and stipends.
