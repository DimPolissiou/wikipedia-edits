He was initially a wing spiker in junior high school and is currently a middle blocker. He inherits the number 10 from his idol, the former Karasuno ace known as the Little Giant. His play style makes him an excellent decoy, and though he wishes to become the team's ace, he grows to learn the importance of the decoy role and embraces it. Hinata is extremely cheerful, boisterous, and optimistic. In spite of his small size, clumsiness, and poor fundamentals, his extraordinary stamina, reflexes, and jumping ability earn him a spot as a regular. He is able to play exceptionally well when partnered with Kageyama as his setter. Hinata is passionately devoted to the sport and practices tirelessly, which leads to explosive growth as a player.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tobio Kageyama|\u5f71\u5c71 \u98db\u96c4|Kageyama Tobio}} he has the fattest ass on earth.\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kaito Ishikawa]]<ref name=\"haikyuucast1\" />|Scott Gibbs<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: Tatsunari Kimura (2015-2017),<ref name=\"ann 2015-07-15\"/> Tatsuya Kageyama (2017-2018),<ref name=\"ann 2018-04-23\">{{cite news | first=Rafael Antonio | last=Pineda | url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-04-23/haikyu-stage-play-performance-schedules-visual-title-revealed/.130725 | title=Haikyu!!

He is the team's setter and was notoriously known as the \"King of the Court\" in junior high. While prodigiously talented, Kageyama's arrogant demeanor and inability to cooperate with teammates caused them to abandon him in the middle of a match, which deeply affected him and earned his nickname. He originally tried to enroll at Shiratorizawa but was not accepted. At Karasuno, he forms an unlikely duo with Hinata and begins to learn the importance of teamwork in volleyball. Kageyama is regarded by many to be a genius, with exceptional accuracy and instincts, and is one of the team's pillars. Nevertheless, he has poor social skills and difficulty expressing himself, often engaging in shouting matches with Hinata.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Daichi Sawamura|\u6fa4\u6751 \u5927\u5730|Sawamura Daichi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]]<ref name=haikyuucast2>{{cite web|title=Satoshi Hino, Miyu Irino, Yuu Hayashi Join Haikyuu Anime Cast|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-11-13/satoshi-hino-miyu-irino-yuu-hayashi-join-haikyu-anime-cast|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>|Justin Doran<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: Keita Tanaka (2015, 2018),<ref name=\"ann 2015-07-15\"/><ref name=\"ann 2017-11-27\">{{cite news | first=Rafael Antonio | last=Pineda | url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-11-27/haikyu-5th-stage-play-new-cast-visual-debut-dates-revealed/.124542 | title=Haikyu!! 5th Stage Play's New Cast, Visual, Debut Dates Revealed | work=[[Anime News Network]] | date=2017-11-27 | accessdate=2019-07-15 }}</ref> Kentaro Akisawa (2016-2017),<ref name=\"ann 2017-11-27\"/> Sho Higano (2019-present)<ref name=\"oricon 2019-07-14\"/>\n:Sawamura is the captain of the volleyball club and a third-year student at Karasuno High School. He is a wing spiker, and very dependable at receiving. He helps stabilize the team with his kindness and resilience, but is also more than capable of intimidating his teammates into behaving when they get on his nerves. He usually prefers to let his fellow players work out their issues themselves rather than step in as the captain.\n\n;{{Nihongo|K\u014dshi Sugawara|\u83c5\u539f \u5b5d\u652f|Sugawara K\u014dshi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Miyu Irino]]<ref name=\"haikyuucast2\" />|[[Adam Gibbs]]<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: [[Hiroki Ino]] (2015-2017),<ref name=\"ann 2015-07-15\"/> Naoki Tanaka (2018),<ref name=\"ann 2017-11-27\"/> Ryu Ichinose (2019-present)<ref name=\"oricon 2019-07-14\"/>\n:Sugawara is the vice captain of the volleyball club and a third-year student at Karasuno High School. Originally the team's regular setter, his position is taken over by Kageyama. In spite of this, Sugawara remains supportive and determined to play as much as he can in his final year of high school. He is cheerful, soft-spoken, and empathetic - Coach Ukai notes that he has the full trust of his teammates. Sugawara is often able to devise new tactics and ideas, as well as sense if a fellow player is off their game.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Ry\u016bnosuke Tanaka|\u7530\u4e2d \u9f8d\u4e4b\u4ecb|Tanaka Ry\u016bnosuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Hayashi]]<ref name=\"haikyuucast2\" />|Greg Cote<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: [[Kouhei Shiota]] (2015-2018),<ref name=\"ann 2015-07-15\"/> Ko Kanegae (2019-present)<ref name=\"oricon 2019-07-14\"/>\n:Tanaka is a second-year student at Karasuno High School and a wing spiker.

He's considered the team's ace and powerhouse. His long hair, tall stature, and impressive strength often intimidate others at first, while some onlookers even suggest he is full-grown man who was held back. Despite this, he is timid and sometimes struggles with self-doubt, often referred to as having a \"glass heart\". Unlike the other third-years, he does not plan to go to university.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Y\u016b Nishinoya|\u897f\u8c37 \u5915|Nishinoya Y\u016b}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Nobuhiko Okamoto]]<ref name=\"haikyuucast3\" />|[[Greg Ayres]]<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: [[Shohei Hashimoto]] (2015-2017),<ref name=\"ann 2015-07-15\"/> Yuto Fuchino (2017-2018),<ref name=\"ann 2018-04-23\"/> Yuma Kitazawa (2019-present)<ref name=\"oricon 2019-07-14\"/>\n:Nishinoya is a second-year student at Karasuno High School and the team's libero. He is called \"Karasuno's Guardian Deity\" because of his skill, having won the \"Best Libero\" award while he was still in middle school. Like Hinata, he is short (the shortest player on the team, in fact) and energetic, but has greater maturity. Nishinoya is considered the backbone of the team, as his specialties are receives and block recovery. He has a close friendship with Asahi, refusing to play unless the latter returned to his role as the team's ace. Like Tanaka, he adores Shimizu, and mentions that one of the main reasons he enrolled at Karasuno in the first place was because he liked the girls' uniforms.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chikara Ennoshita|\u7e01\u4e0b \u529b|Ennoshita Chikara}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Toshiki Masuda]]<ref name=haikyuucast4>{{cite web|title=Hiroshi Kamiya, Kaori Nazuka, Daisuke Namikawa Joins Haikyuu!!

Prior to the main storyline, he was one of many students who dropped out of the volleyball team due to high standards and extreme practice sessions of Coach Ukai Sr. Eventually, due to his love for volleyball, he returns to the team to find that the coach had retired again.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hisashi Kinoshita|\u6728\u4e0b \u4e45\u5fd7|Kinoshita Hisashi}}\n:{{Voiced by|Nobuyori Sagara|[[Blake Shepard]]<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>}}\n:Played by: Sean Osada (2019-present)<ref name=\"oricon 2019-07-14\"/>\n:Kinoshita is a second-year student at Karasuno High School and a wing spiker.

He is initially antagonistic towards Hinata and Kageyama, mocking their various shortcomings. Despite his flippant and sometimes outright negative attitude, Tsukishima is a very analytical and smart blocker, as well as Karasuno's tallest player. Tsukishima is the only team member to question his own devotion to the sport, due in part to past personal experiences.

She also designs posters to ask for donations for the team, being helped and influenced by her mother, who is a designer.\n\n==Rival schools==\n\n===Aoba Johsai High School===\nDetermined to be a strong school, especially after the inclusion of Oikawa. Their play style focuses on strategies and quick on the spot decisions, making them very difficult to score against. Each player of Aoba Johsai has been said to have the ability to become an ace player.\n;{{Nihongo|T\u014dru Oikawa|\u53ca\u5ddd \u5fb9|Oikawa T\u014dru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Daisuke Namikawa]]<ref name=\"haikyuucast4\" />|[[Chris Patton]]<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Oikawa is the setter and third-year captain of the Aoba Johsai High School volleyball club and is widely regarded as the ace setter, introduced as a main antagonist in manga and anime [[Haikyuu!!]]. He was also Kageyama's senior when they both attended Kitagawa Daiichi Middle School. He is called \"The Great King\" by Hinata.\n:Despite his flirtatious nature and childishness, Oikawa is an excellent, well-rounded player and is extremely serious about volleyball. He's known to have a \"disgusting personality\" amongst both opponents and his own teammates because of his smug attitude. Oikawa also frequently makes cheerful remarks, but follows them up with serious or intimidating afterthoughts. Despite his flirtatious and blas\u00e9 exterior, Oikawa is extremely intelligent and cunning, to the point of his own teammates stating they wouldn't want to be friends with him because he figures out everyone's weaknesses.\n:He works extremely hard, as is evident by his vigorous practices and injuries caused by overworking in training before. His own teammates have pointed out his rigorous schedule. In addition, Oikawa spends time watching past games of his rivals, observing their movements ahead of time and strategizing how to defeat them. His intelligence and game sense are also unparalleled, as shown when he points out his opponents' weaknesses in a short period of time. He is also capable of rising his teammates' performance by passing them the perfect tosses, no matter their habits or his relationships towards them. \n:In his free time, he coaches his nephew and other children at Lil Tykes Volleyball Classroom. He and the third years as well as the entire team shares a very close bond. Despite being exasperated by Oikawa's antics, the team deeply respects him. He and Iwaizumi are childhood best friends and have played volleyball together for a long time. They are completely in sync with each other's thoughts both on and out of court. When combined, Iwaizumi and Oikawa's first names (Hajime and T\u014dru respectively) form  \"\u4e00\u5fb9\" meaning \"obstinate\" or \"dauntless\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Issei Matsukawa|\u677e\u5ddd \u4e00\u9759|Matsukawa Issei}} \n:{{voiced by|Isamu Y\u016bsen|Paul Locklear<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Matsukawa is one of the middle blockers and a third-year student.

He shares a very close bond with the 3rd years, especially Hanamaki. The two are shown to be swapping jerseys in more than one occasion. He is almost always with Hanamaki. He enjoys Oikawa's endless jokes towards Iwaizumi, spectating their banter along with Hanamaki, or occasionally chiming in with their own teasing remarks.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Takahiro Hanamaki|\u82b1\u5dfb \u8cb4\u5927|Hanamaki Takahiro}}\n:{{voiced by|T\u014dru Sakurai|Jack Ivy<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Hanamaki is a wing spiker and a third-year student. Hanamaki is usually calm and collected. He is observant and perceptive, able to read the game situation quite well, and doesn't talk much during games. Despite this, he does have a sense of humour, especially with the third years, and generally gets along pretty well with the other team members. He is seen flashing the peace sign when Oikawa compliments him. He shares a very close bond with the 3rd years, especially Matsukawa. These two are shown to be swapping jerseys in more than one occasion.

He acts supportively to all, including Kageyama, and calls Oikawa out for his childish antics. He often resorts to violence with Oikawa whenever he teases or provokes him, but this does not change the fact that he cares immensely for him, as shown when he makes an effort to stop Oikawa from either working too hard or losing confidence. Iwaizumi's firm-yet-caring attitude has led some members of the Aoba J\u014dsai team to look up to and respect him.

He seems to enjoy being challenged, due to the fact that he smiled when Nishinoya used the same move as him when he set from the back row. It is shown that he can be very gentle and supportive when he tries to cheer up Ky\u014dtani after he misses a point, regardless of Ky\u014dtani's lack of proximity with the rest of the team. Before he became the libero, it was mentioned that he was actually a setter, however it is unknown if he ever played as a setter at Aoba J\u014dsai High.\n\n;{{nihongo|Shigeru Yahaba|\u77e2\u5dfe \u79c0|Yahaba Shigeru}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kengo Kawanishi]]|Jeremy Gee<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Yahaba is a second-year and a setter.

He was Kageyama's former teammate at Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High. He is also known as \"Turnip Head.\" Being the one who raised his voice against Kageyama during middle school, he feels both guilty and rivalry towards him. He keeps questioning Hinata about Kageyama's welfare, although when he meets Kageyama, he only challenges him.\n\n;{{nihongo|Akira Kunimi|\u56fd\u898b \u82f1|Kunimi Akira}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Atsushi Tamaru]]|[[Mark Laskowski|Mark X.

He is also known as \"Curtain Hair.\" He has a lazy personality, due to which he usually tends to be lax and not play to his utmost strength. Kageyama did not like this, and used to shout at him to play with his full strength at middle school, whereas Oikawa does the opposite. By conserving his strength throughout the game by being lax, he starts playing with full power during the later half of the games, when everyone else is exhausted, giving him higher chances of scoring and making him reliable.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kentar\u014d Ky\u014dtani|\u4eac\u8c37 \u8ce2\u592a\u90ce|Ky\u014dtani Kentar\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Shunsuke Takeuchi]]|Michael Wronski<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\">{{cite web|title=HAIKYU!!

His play style is reckless, since he likes hitting the ball with everything he's got, without looking at whether he might be blocked. This also makes him a double edged sword. His personality is rough, since he displays absolutely no team work, and doesn't even care about respecting his seniors, reprimanding them when anything is off. He stopped coming to practice because of this, but then returns after the first tournament, thinking that the third years might have retired by them. Despite his rough personality, he is a strong player. His middle school team is known to have been strong only during the years he was in it. He also has great body control and great dexterity, being able to spike with either hand.\n:Though he only listens to Iwaizumi, having been beaten by him in various games, Oikawa is the only one who can actually put him to good use in the game. Eventually, he starts becoming one with the team.\n\n===Nekoma High===\nThe word 'neko' means 'cat' in Japanese. Thus, when there used to be rivalry between Nekoma and Karasuno, it was often referred to as the \"trashcan showdown\" or \"Cat Vs. Crow\".

He is also childhood friends with Kenma. He is called as 'scheming captain', as he is great with strategy, and also likes to tease people. Very different from his childhood friend, Kenma, who is very serious and silent, Kuroo is quite playful and sly. He is deemed to be talented middle blocker by coach Ukai Jr. During practice matches, he gives a lot of tips and advice to Tsukishima (particularly) about blocking, as he wants to fulfill his coach's dream of battling it out with Karasuno at the Nationals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kai Nobuyuki|\u6d77 \u4fe1\u884c|Kai Nobuyuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takanori Hoshino]]|Joel McCray<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Kai is a third-year student at Nekoma High and is the vice-captain and wing spiker for the volleyball team.

Like Tanaka, he has a tendency to lash out, and also has bad luck when it comes to girls.

He too is a fan of Shimizu.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kenma Kozume|\u5b64\u722a \u7814\u78e8|Kozume Kenma}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Kaji]]<ref name=\"nekomacast\" />|[[Clint Bickham]]<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: Takato Nagata (2016-present)<ref name=\"ann 2018-04-23\"/>\n:Kenma is a second-year student at Nekoma High and a setter for the volleyball team. He is an introvert, choosing to play video games instead of playing outside and doesn't interact well with people. But he is very skilled at volleyball, since he is very observant due to him being nervous around people, and has the ability to come up with excellent strategies to counter the opposite team. He is childhood friends with Kuroo. He also became good friends with Hinata after meeting by coincidence when the both of them happen to get lost. Their encounter had taken place before they'd met officially for a practice game between their schools. He is considered the 'backbone', 'brain', and 'heart' for the Nekoma team, and all of his teammates are very protective of him and admire him greatly. It is shown that he texts Hinata often, revealing that even though they have opposite personalities, they are still good friends with each other.\n\n;{{nihongo|Sh\u014dhei Fukunaga|\u798f\u6c38 \u62db\u5e73|Fukunaga Sh\u014dhei}}\n:{{voiced by|Sh\u014dta Ch\u014dnan|Matthew Carter<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Fukunaga is a second-year student at Nekoma and a wing spiker for the volleyball team.

Like Hinata, he has an excitable and positive personality. He is the first player who was able to stop Hinata and Kageyama's weird quick strike fully. His positive attitude shows most when he praises Hinata for being able to come up with a new shot in the middle of the game, after the weird quick was stopped. He becomes good friends with Hinata, even though they were playing as rivals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Lev Haiba|\u7070\u7fbd \u30ea\u30a8\u30fc\u30d5|Haiba Ri\u0113bu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mark Ishii]]|Mike Yager<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>}}\n:Lev is a first-year at Nekoma and a middle blocker.

He becomes the captain once Moniwa retires. He and Kamasaki always argue and don't get along. Since he was pretty laid back before he became captain, taking care of their new hyped up setter, Koganegawa reminds him of how he used to cause problems for his seniors. He is usually seen together with Aone, while taking breaks in between matches, and also at school, being the same class. He has a special enmity with Karasuno, since he wasn't able to stop the last score against them at their last match.\n\n;{{nihongo|Takanobu Aone|\u9752\u6839 \u9ad8\u4f38|Aone Takanobu}}\n:{{voiced by|Hiroki Matsukawa|Mike Haimoto<ref name=\":0\" />}}\n:Aone is a second year student at Dateko and a middle blocker. He has a scary face, but is actually very kind. He doesn't speak much, only talking when he really needs to. Before the match with Karasuno, he used to have a habit of pointing out the ace of the opposite team, as soon as he met them. He establishes a bond with Hinata after he loses 2-0 against Karasuno, recognizing his ability of acting as an efficient decoy, even with his small body. He even feels offended for Hinata when Futakuchi calls Hinata useless without Kageyama and later also advises Koganegawa that it is not always the tall and strong that are difficult to defeat.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yutaka Obara|\u5c0f\u539f \u8c4a|Obara Yutaka}}\n:{{voiced by|Isamu Yusen|Jason Duga}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Obara is second year student at Dateko and a wing spiker for the volleyball team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kousuke Sakunami|\u4f5c\u4e26 \u6d69\u8f14|Sakunami Kousuke}}\n:{{voiced by|Mao \u014cnishi|Joel McCray}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Sakunami is a first year student at Dateko and libero for the volleyball team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kanji Koganegawa |\u9ec4\u91d1\u5ddd\u8cab\u81f3|Koganegawa Kanji}}\n:{{voiced by|Masayuki Shouji|Mason Butler}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Haikyu!!

Even though he is exceptionally tall for a setter, which is his primary strength, he is very new to setting, as seen when he sets a ball to Futakuchi with a 'frigging' high angle, and also when he sets the ball towards Aone, the ball ends up caught by their coach instead. He has an extremely energetic personality and believes that a player should give everything they have in a game.

He causes trouble for his team with his extreme mood swings, but also forms their main strength, as he is never bothered by how strong the opposite team is. Takeda also notes that Bokuto is a \"weird\" player who can lift the spirit of both his teammates and rivals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Keiji Akaashi|\u8d64\u8466 \u4eac\u6cbb|Akaashi Keiji}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]|Jeremy Gee}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Akaashi is a second year student at Fukurodani Academy.

Their play style centers around the powerful \"left cannon\", i.e., around the ace wing spiker. Coach Ukai Jr has commented that the Shiratori team's power is more of an addition of each player's strength, as compared to other teams' multiplication, since each player only plays to his own skills.\n;{{nihongo|Wakatoshi Ushijima|\u725b\u5cf6\u82e5\u5229|Ushijima Wakatoshi}}\n:{{voiced by|Ry\u014dta Takeuchi|Joe Daniels}}<ref name=\"Shiratorizawa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-07-14/3rd-haikyu-anime-casts-shiratorizawa-gakuen-volleyball-club/.104311|title=3rd Haikyu!!

Hinata is extremely cheerful, boisterous, and optimistic. In spite of his small size, clumsiness, and poor fundamentals, his extraordinary stamina, reflexes, and jumping ability earn him a spot as a regular.

He originally tried to enroll at Shiratorizawa but was not accepted. At Karasuno, he forms an unlikely duo with Hinata and begins to learn the importance of teamwork in volleyball.

He was also Kageyama's senior when they both attended Kitagawa Daiichi Middle School. He is called \"The Great King\" by Hinata.\n:Despite his flirtatious nature and childishness, Oikawa is an excellent, well-rounded player and is extremely serious about volleyball. He's known to have a \"disgusting personality\" amongst both opponents and his own teammates because of his smug attitude. Oikawa also frequently makes cheerful remarks, but follows them up with serious or intimidating afterthoughts. Despite his flirtatious and blas\u00e9 exterior, Oikawa is extremely intelligent and cunning, to the point of his own teammates stating they wouldn't want to be friends with him because he figures out everyone's weaknesses.\n:He works extremely hard, as is evident by his vigorous practices and injuries caused by overworking in training before. His own teammates have pointed out his rigorous schedule. In addition, Oikawa spends time watching past games of his rivals, observing their movements ahead of time and strategizing how to defeat them. His intelligence and game sense are also unparalleled, as shown when he points out his opponents' weaknesses in a short period of time. He is also capable of rising his teammates' performance by passing them the perfect tosses, no matter their habits or his relationships towards them. \n:In his free time, he coaches his nephew and other children at Lil Tykes Volleyball Classroom. He and the third years as well as the entire team shares a very close bond. Despite being exasperated by Oikawa's antics, the team deeply respects him. He and Iwaizumi are childhood best friends and have played volleyball together for a long time. They are completely in sync with each other's thoughts both on and out of court. When combined, Iwaizumi and Oikawa's first names (Hajime and T\u014dru respectively) form  \"\u4e00\u5fb9\" meaning \"obstinate\" or \"dauntless\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Issei Matsukawa|\u677e\u5ddd \u4e00\u9759|Matsukawa Issei}} \n:{{voiced by|Isamu Y\u016bsen|Paul Locklear<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Matsukawa is one of the middle blockers and a third-year student. He is cool headed and although serious looking, Matsukawa is shown to sometimes carry a joking air, such as calling out his food orders in the middle of a match. He shares a very close bond with the 3rd years, especially Hanamaki. The two are shown to be swapping jerseys in more than one occasion. He is almost always with Hanamaki. He enjoys Oikawa's endless jokes towards Iwaizumi, spectating their banter along with Hanamaki, or occasionally chiming in with their own teasing remarks.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Takahiro Hanamaki|\u82b1\u5dfb \u8cb4\u5927|Hanamaki Takahiro}}\n:{{voiced by|T\u014dru Sakurai|Jack Ivy<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Hanamaki is a wing spiker and a third-year student. Hanamaki is usually calm and collected. He is observant and perceptive, able to read the game situation quite well, and doesn't talk much during games. Despite this, he does have a sense of humour, especially with the third years, and generally gets along pretty well with the other team members. He is seen flashing the peace sign when Oikawa compliments him. He shares a very close bond with the 3rd years, especially Matsukawa. These two are shown to be swapping jerseys in more than one occasion. He is almost always with Matsukawa.\n\n;{{nihongo|Hajime Iwaizumi|\u5ca9\u6cc9 \u4e00|Iwaizumi Hajime}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Hiroyuki Yoshino]]|Benjamin McLaughlin<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Iwaizumi is the ace and third-year vice-captain of the team, as well as one of the wing spikers and Oikawa's childhood friend and \"pillar.\" Iwaizumi is a stubborn but reliable teammate, often filling in Oikawa's spot as a morale booster if needed. He acts supportively to all, including Kageyama, and calls Oikawa out for his childish antics. He often resorts to violence with Oikawa whenever he teases or provokes him, but this does not change the fact that he cares immensely for him, as shown when he makes an effort to stop Oikawa from either working too hard or losing confidence. Iwaizumi's firm-yet-caring attitude has led some members of the Aoba J\u014dsai team to look up to and respect him. When combined, Iwaizumi and Oikawa's first names (Hajime and T\u014dru respectively) form  \"\u4e00\u5fb9\" meaning \"obstinate\" or \"dauntless\".\n\n;{{nihongo|Shinji Watari|\u6e21 \u89aa\u6cbb|Watari Shinji}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Arthur Lounsbery]]|Blake Jackson<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Watari is a second-year student and the team's libero. He seems to enjoy being challenged, due to the fact that he smiled when Nishinoya used the same move as him when he set from the back row. It is shown that he can be very gentle and supportive when he tries to cheer up Ky\u014dtani after he misses a point, regardless of Ky\u014dtani's lack of proximity with the rest of the team. Before he became the libero, it was mentioned that he was actually a setter, however it is unknown if he ever played as a setter at Aoba J\u014dsai High.\n\n;{{nihongo|Shigeru Yahaba|\u77e2\u5dfe \u79c0|Yahaba Shigeru}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kengo Kawanishi]]|Jeremy Gee<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Yahaba is a second-year and a setter. He is a show off by nature. He doesn't like Kyotani, since he had stopped coming to practice, but was still chosen as a regular. He is the only person in the team who scolds Kyotani to his face, asking him to play for the team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Y\u016btar\u014d Kindaichi|\u91d1\u7530\u4e00 \u52c7\u592a\u90ce|Kindaichi Y\u016btar\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Makoto Furukawa]]|[[David Matranga]]<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Kindaichi is a first-year and a middle blocker. He was Kageyama's former teammate at Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High. He is also known as \"Turnip Head.\" Being the one who raised his voice against Kageyama during middle school, he feels both guilty and rivalry towards him. He keeps questioning Hinata about Kageyama's welfare, although when he meets Kageyama, he only challenges him.\n\n;{{nihongo|Akira Kunimi|\u56fd\u898b \u82f1|Kunimi Akira}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Atsushi Tamaru]]|[[Mark Laskowski|Mark X.

He is also known as \"Curtain Hair.\" He has a lazy personality, due to which he usually tends to be lax and not play to his utmost strength. Kageyama did not like this, and used to shout at him to play with his full strength at middle school, whereas Oikawa does the opposite. By conserving his strength throughout the game by being lax, he starts playing with full power during the later half of the games, when everyone else is exhausted, giving him higher chances of scoring and making him reliable.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kentar\u014d Ky\u014dtani|\u4eac\u8c37 \u8ce2\u592a\u90ce|Ky\u014dtani Kentar\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Shunsuke Takeuchi]]|Michael Wronski<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\">{{cite web|title=HAIKYU!!

His play style is reckless, since he likes hitting the ball with everything he's got, without looking at whether he might be blocked. This also makes him a double edged sword. His personality is rough, since he displays absolutely no team work, and doesn't even care about respecting his seniors, reprimanding them when anything is off. He stopped coming to practice because of this, but then returns after the first tournament, thinking that the third years might have retired by them. Despite his rough personality, he is a strong player. His middle school team is known to have been strong only during the years he was in it. He also has great body control and great dexterity, being able to spike with either hand.\n:Though he only listens to Iwaizumi, having been beaten by him in various games, Oikawa is the only one who can actually put him to good use in the game. Eventually, he starts becoming one with the team.\n\n===Nekoma High===\nThe word 'neko' means 'cat' in Japanese. Thus, when there used to be rivalry between Nekoma and Karasuno, it was often referred to as the \"trashcan showdown\" or \"Cat Vs. Crow\". Their team basically builds its play with strong receivers, never letting the ball drop and strategies developed by its smart setter.\n;{{nihongo|Kuroo Tetsur\u014d|\u9ed2\u5c3e \u9244\u6717|Kuroo Tetsur\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Y\u016bichi Nakamura]]<ref name=nekomacast>{{cite web|title=Yuichi Nakamura, Yuki Kaji and Shinnosuke Tachibana Join Hakyuu!!

He is also childhood friends with Kenma. He is called as 'scheming captain', as he is great with strategy, and also likes to tease people. Very different from his childhood friend, Kenma, who is very serious and silent, Kuroo is quite playful and sly. He is deemed to be talented middle blocker by coach Ukai Jr. During practice matches, he gives a lot of tips and advice to Tsukishima (particularly) about blocking, as he wants to fulfill his coach's dream of battling it out with Karasuno at the Nationals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kai Nobuyuki|\u6d77 \u4fe1\u884c|Kai Nobuyuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takanori Hoshino]]|Joel McCray<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Kai is a third-year student at Nekoma High and is the vice-captain and wing spiker for the volleyball team.

Like Tanaka, he has a tendency to lash out, and also has bad luck when it comes to girls. He and Kenma would often have arguments, since he believes in putting in all his power and going all out, but Kenma doesn't like to spend his energy. He too is a fan of Shimizu.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kenma Kozume|\u5b64\u722a \u7814\u78e8|Kozume Kenma}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Kaji]]<ref name=\"nekomacast\" />|[[Clint Bickham]]<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: Takato Nagata (2016-present)<ref name=\"ann 2018-04-23\"/>\n:Kenma is a second-year student at Nekoma High and a setter for the volleyball team. He is an introvert, choosing to play video games instead of playing outside and doesn't interact well with people. But he is very skilled at volleyball, since he is very observant due to him being nervous around people, and has the ability to come up with excellent strategies to counter the opposite team. He is childhood friends with Kuroo. He also became good friends with Hinata after meeting by coincidence when the both of them happen to get lost. Their encounter had taken place before they'd met officially for a practice game between their schools. He is considered the 'backbone', 'brain', and 'heart' for the Nekoma team, and all of his teammates are very protective of him and admire him greatly. It is shown that he texts Hinata often, revealing that even though they have opposite personalities, they are still good friends with each other.\n\n;{{nihongo|Sh\u014dhei Fukunaga|\u798f\u6c38 \u62db\u5e73|Fukunaga Sh\u014dhei}}\n:{{voiced by|Sh\u014dta Ch\u014dnan|Matthew Carter<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Fukunaga is a second-year student at Nekoma and a wing spiker for the volleyball team.

Like Hinata, he has an excitable and positive personality. He is the first player who was able to stop Hinata and Kageyama's weird quick strike fully. His positive attitude shows most when he praises Hinata for being able to come up with a new shot in the middle of the game, after the weird quick was stopped. He becomes good friends with Hinata, even though they were playing as rivals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Lev Haiba|\u7070\u7fbd \u30ea\u30a8\u30fc\u30d5|Haiba Ri\u0113bu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mark Ishii]]|Mike Yager<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>}}\n:Lev is a first-year at Nekoma and a middle blocker.

He becomes the captain once Moniwa retires. He and Kamasaki always argue and don't get along. Since he was pretty laid back before he became captain, taking care of their new hyped up setter, Koganegawa reminds him of how he used to cause problems for his seniors. He is usually seen together with Aone, while taking breaks in between matches, and also at school, being the same class. He has a special enmity with Karasuno, since he wasn't able to stop the last score against them at their last match.\n\n;{{nihongo|Takanobu Aone|\u9752\u6839 \u9ad8\u4f38|Aone Takanobu}}\n:{{voiced by|Hiroki Matsukawa|Mike Haimoto<ref name=\":0\" />}}\n:Aone is a second year student at Dateko and a middle blocker. He has a scary face, but is actually very kind. He doesn't speak much, only talking when he really needs to. Before the match with Karasuno, he used to have a habit of pointing out the ace of the opposite team, as soon as he met them. He establishes a bond with Hinata after he loses 2-0 against Karasuno, recognizing his ability of acting as an efficient decoy, even with his small body. He even feels offended for Hinata when Futakuchi calls Hinata useless without Kageyama and later also advises Koganegawa that it is not always the tall and strong that are difficult to defeat.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yutaka Obara|\u5c0f\u539f \u8c4a|Obara Yutaka}}\n:{{voiced by|Isamu Yusen|Jason Duga}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Obara is second year student at Dateko and a wing spiker for the volleyball team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kousuke Sakunami|\u4f5c\u4e26 \u6d69\u8f14|Sakunami Kousuke}}\n:{{voiced by|Mao \u014cnishi|Joel McCray}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Sakunami is a first year student at Dateko and libero for the volleyball team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kanji Koganegawa |\u9ec4\u91d1\u5ddd\u8cab\u81f3|Koganegawa Kanji}}\n:{{voiced by|Masayuki Shouji|Mason Butler}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Haikyu!!

Even though he is exceptionally tall for a setter, which is his primary strength, he is very new to setting, as seen when he sets a ball to Futakuchi with a 'frigging' high angle, and also when he sets the ball towards Aone, the ball ends up caught by their coach instead.

He causes trouble for his team with his extreme mood swings, but also forms their main strength, as he is never bothered by how strong the opposite team is. Takeda also notes that Bokuto is a \"weird\" player who can lift the spirit of both his teammates and rivals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Keiji Akaashi|\u8d64\u8466 \u4eac\u6cbb|Akaashi Keiji}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]|Jeremy Gee}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Akaashi is a second year student at Fukurodani Academy.

Their play style centers around the powerful \"left cannon\", i.e., around the ace wing spiker.
