H. Almaas''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|l|m|\u0259|s}} {{respell|AHL|m\u0259ss}}) is the pen name of '''A. Hameed Ali''' (born 1944), a [[Kuwaiti American]] author and spiritual teacher who writes about and teaches an approach to spiritual development informed by modern psychology and therapy which he calls the [[Diamond Approach]]. \"''Almaas''\" is the [[Arabic]] word for \"diamond\". \n\nAlmaas is originally from [[Kuwait]]. He is the spiritual head of the Ridhwan School. He may be described, among other things, as an [[Integral theory (philosophy)|Integral theorist]], [[mystic]], [[spiritual teacher]] and an exponent of the [[perennial philosophy]].\n\nAlmaas' books were originally published by the Ridhwan School, under the Diamond Books publishing title, but are now published by [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]].\n\nThe Diamond Approach is a contemporary spiritual path integrating the teachings and practices of the ancient wisdom traditions with modern [[depth psychology]] ([[object relations theory]] in particular). The Diamond Approach is derived from the experiences of Almaas, along with Karen Johnson and Faisal Muqaddam (who split off early on to develop his own approach). They were among the first students of [[Claudio Naranjo]], an early pioneer of the integration of spiritual and therapeutic work.\n\nThe curriculum of the work draws upon the founders' backgrounds in [[Sufism]], [[Platonism]], [[Buddhism]] and the [[Fourth Way]]. Teachers of the Diamond Approach focus on the students' specific perception of their own immediate work issues.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Who_can_teach \"Q: Who can teach the Diamond Approach?\"</ref> Presentation of a canonical body of knowledge and practice is introduced over time as required.\n\n== Life ==\nA. Hameed Ali was born in [[Kuwait]] in 1944. He was a victim of [[polio]] at 18 months old and now walks with a crutch as a result.<ref>{{cite news\n | author=[[Tony Schwartz (author)|Schwartz, Tony]]\n | title = Uncovering The Essential Self\n | work = New Age Journal\n | date = May 1995\n | url =https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/uncovering-essential-self\n | accessdate = 16 April 2020\n}}</ref> At the age of 18, he moved to the United States to study at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Ali was working on his PhD in physics when he reached a turning point in his life that led him more and more into inquiring into the psychological and spiritual aspects of human nature. His interest in the truth of human nature and the true nature of reality resulted in the creation and unfoldment of the Diamond Approach.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=A. Hameed Ali|url=https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/founders|website=diamondapproach.org}</ref>\n\n== Diamond Approach ==\nThe Diamond Approach is a spiritual teaching that utilizes a distinctive form of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. Its aim is absolute freedom that can be described as living realization, a dynamic enlightenment where transcendent truth lives personally in the world. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization.<ref>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=The Diamond Approach \u2013 Hameed Ali (A. H. Almaas)|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/|website=ahalmaas.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Ridhwan Foundation is the nonprofit spiritual organization established to support and preserve the integrity of the Diamond Approach teaching. The Ridhwan Foundation is legally recognized as a church and the role of a teacher is equivalent to that of a minister. People are ordained as spiritual teachers of the Ridhwan Foundation, which is the name given to its ministers.\n\n=== Spiritual practice as a phenomenology of being ===\nThe Diamond Approach is described as a \"response to an important need that is being felt in many quarters, a need for a spiritually informed psychology, or conversely, for a psychologically grounded spirituality. This perspective does not separate psychological and spiritual experience, and hence sees no dichotomy between depth psychology and spiritual work... This body of knowledge is not an integration or synthesis of modern depth psychology and traditional spiritual understanding. The inclination to think in terms of integration of the two is due to the prevailing belief in the dichotomy between the fields of psychology and spirituality, a dichotomy in which the Diamond Mind understanding does not participate.\" (Almaas)<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''The Void: Inner Spaciousness and Ego Structure'', Shambhala Publications, Boston MA, 1986.</ref>\n\nThe Diamond Approach, according to its followers, can be called a Phenomenology of Being that offers a precise description of the various aspects and dimensions of Spirit or Being and is also a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] psychotherapy which seeks to heal the wounds of the soul by reconnecting it to Spirit.\n\n=== Principal ideas ===\n\n==== Structure of reality ====\nIn the Diamond Approach, reality is seen as consisting of three elements: God/Being/Spirit, Soul/Self and World/Cosmos.\n\n''Being'' is understood as the inner source and true nature of reality, which is the focus of the great spiritual traditions of both East and West, and is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'', ''[[Shunyata]]'', ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Tao]]''. Being is understood as consisting of five co-emergent \"boundless dimensions\": Divine Love, Pure Presence, Nonconceptual Awareness, The Logos, and The Absolute.\n\n''Soul'' is understood to be the individual consciousness that connects the world with Being, an idea found in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. It is believed in the Diamond Approach that the soul can be experienced as a living presence that contains the thoughts, feelings and sensations usually called our \"self\".\n\n''World'' is understood as the outer manifestation of reality, the multitude of physical forms that all people are familiar with.\n\n==== Essence and the essential aspects ====\nWhile most spiritual paths conceive of Being as universal, the Diamond Approach also pays a great deal of attention to a more individual way of experiencing Being, called Essence. The concept of Essence is similar to the Hindu idea of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. While Being is the true nature of all of reality, Essence is the portion of it that forms the true and personal nature of the soul. It is experienced as a substantial fluid Presence which can differentiate into various qualities or aspects, such as compassion, strength, will, joy, peace, love, value, humanness, personalness, identity, and space.<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''Essence'' Weiser Books, Boston MA, 1986.</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm Essence & Spiritual Presence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707032123/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm |date=7 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==== Theory of holes ====\nAs our soul develops it is faced with a double challenge: it must learn to function in the World, while also remaining connected to Spirit. For various reasons, some innate and others environmental, we slowly become alienated from our Essence through the development of fixed patterns of perception and behaviour known as the personality or ego. Each of these patterns or ego structures disconnects us from a specific Essential Aspect. In other words, it is built around the \"Hole\" of this aspect. By exploring its structure, both cognitively and experientially, one eventually confronts the Hole and by going through it the lost aspect is retrieved.<ref>Ch. 2 \u2013 \"The Theory of Holes.\" Almaas, A. H. ''Diamond Heart Book 1'', Shambhala, 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe Diamond Approach uses methods which its founders learned from Claudio Naranjo. Almaas' scientific background (he studied physics at Berkeley<ref name=bio />) helps explain the emphasis on rigorous (self) inquiry. Several contexts for participation are provided, including regular one-on-one sessions with a trained teacher, seminars and participation in various formats of organized ongoing groups.<ref>[https://www.diamondapproach.org/ways-to-engage Ways to Engage with The Diamond Approach]</ref>\n\n==== Presence ====\nThe practice referred to as \"presence\" is based on two methods, learning to sense one's body (especially one's arms and legs) in an ongoing manner and regularly focusing one's attention on a point in the belly called the \"kath center\" (known in Chinese philosophy as the ''[[dantian]]'' and in Japanese culture as the [[Hara_(tanden)|hara]]). These methods help a person to become more grounded in the body and in physical reality and also, in time, to develop the ability to experience oneself as the presence of Essence.\n\n==== Inquiry ====\nThe Diamond Approach centers on practice of investigation of the self, experience and perception.  \"Inquiry\" answers the question posed by [[Socrates]]: \"How does one set up as the object of one's investigation, that about which one knows nothing?\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  One starts by wanting to find out, living a question, while recognizing preconceptions, preconditions and expectations as to the nature of what one may learn and instead attending to one's immediate or present experience. While not explicitly acknowledged as such, inquiry in effect combines (as a descriptive mechanism only, as the inquiry process is beyond mere language) the practice of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s \"transcendental phenomenological reduction, or epoch\u00e9\", with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychodynamic exploration. An important feature of inquiry is that a person learns to be aware of both the content of experience (emotions, thoughts, sensations) and the attitudes and reactions towards it. In this way the subject-object dichotomy is transcended and one learns to relate to oneself without having to create inner splits. Open-ended inquiry is both a path to, and the state of, a realized person and in time is understood to be a self-revelation of the mysteries of Being.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThe main motivation for embarking on the spiritual journey in this approach is love for the Truth. \"Truth\" refers to seeing things as they really are, which ultimately comes down to recognizing Being as the true nature of everything. Love for the truth therefore combines the traditional [[bhakti]] and [[jnana]] perspectives on spirituality.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Goal_of_DA \u2013 \"Q: What is the goal of the Diamond Approach?\"</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm Truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725054112/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Critiques ==\nThe fees associated with the retreats and other methodologies that are part of the structure of the school have been criticized.<ref name=\"dailyCamera\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_12960184 |title=New path: Ridhwan teaches new way of looking at the world |date= 17 April 2009 | work=[[Daily Camera]]|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> However, the fees are relatively low compared to other spiritual schools and retreats.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Furthermore, the founder and lead teacher, Hameed Ali, regularly points out that the Diamond Approach is only one path to truth and cannot in itself be all-encompassing.  Students are permitted and even encouraged to question the practices of the school and to explore whether the school is a good fit for them personally.\n\nIn addition to the fees associated with the retreats, participants become provisional members of the Ridhwan Foundation (legally a church). After an unspecified designated period of time, they are asked to confirm membership by paying the appropriate membership fees to the foundation. These membership fees are $160/year for students involved in the group teachings and $60/year for provisional members.\n\nThe work of Almaas has received praise from spiritual teachers and explorers such as [[John Welwood]], [[Brant Cortright]], [[Gabor Mat\u00e9]], [[Jack Kornfield]] and [[Ken Wilber]].<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (372-373)</ref> Wilber, while tentatively supportive of the Diamond Approach, disputes some details. For example, he does not agree that infants have essential experiences, maintaining that the infant exists purely in the physical, material world \u2013 \"instinctual, vital, impulsive, narcissistic, egocentric; living for food, its God is all mouth.\"<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (362\u2013363)</ref> Almaas has responded that Wilber's critique demonstrates a misinterpretation based on Wilber's own linear, four-stage categorization of spiritual development. Almaas' perspective is that infants experience a type of true nature/Spirit, but one that is very distinct from, and less integrated than, the experiences of essentially realized adults.<ref>Appendix D in Almaas, A. H. ''The Inner Journey Home'', Shambhala: Boston, 2004.</ref>\n\n== Ridhwan School ==\nThe Ridhwan School is a loosely-knit affiliation of ongoing spiritual groups founded in 1976 by Almaas. The school is dedicated to the teaching of the Diamond Approach. It is principally based in [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boulder, Colorado]] with other groups throughout North America and in parts of Europe and Australia.   Almaas is the spiritual head of the school and individual groups are taught by qualified Ridhwan teachers. The name of the school derives from the Arabic word for \"contentment\":\n\n<blockquote>\"Ridhwan is a kind of contentment which arises when you're liberated. Your personality becomes contented when you're free. Your personality itself is free from its suffering and conflict.\"<ref>''Diamond Heart, Book 2'', pg. 11 \u2013 [https://www.diamondapproach.org/glossary/refinery_phrases/ridhwan Book Excerpts about Ridhwan]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe school rejects \"quick fixes\" and graduation, and the students are engaged in learning and therapy for an indefinite period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=CSGB&d_place=CSGB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F34BBA41766BD2A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Treating the Soul for Life: School rejects 'quick fixes' |date= 23 October 1992 | work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]]|accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Elixir of Enlightenment'', 1984, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|978-0-87728-613-4}}\n*''Essence: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1986, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|0-87728-627-2}}\n*''Essence with The Elixir of Enlightenment: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1998, [[Weiser Books]], {{ISBN|1-57863-044-4}}\n*''Facets of Unity: The Enneagram of Holy Ideas'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-14-4}}\n*''Luminous Night's Journey: An Autobiographical Fragment'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-08-3}}\n*''The Inner Journey Home: Soul's Realization of the Unity of Reality'', 2004, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-1-59030-109-8}}\n*''The Power of Divine Eros''.

He may be described, among other things, as an [[Integral theory (philosophy)|Integral theorist]], [[mystic]], [[spiritual teacher]] and an exponent of the [[perennial philosophy]].\n\nAlmaas' books were originally published by the Ridhwan School, under the Diamond Books publishing title, but are now published by [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]].\n\nThe Diamond Approach is a contemporary spiritual path integrating the teachings and practices of the ancient wisdom traditions with modern [[depth psychology]] ([[object relations theory]] in particular). The Diamond Approach is derived from the experiences of Almaas, along with Karen Johnson and Faisal Muqaddam (who split off early on to develop his own approach). They were among the first students of [[Claudio Naranjo]], an early pioneer of the integration of spiritual and therapeutic work.\n\nThe curriculum of the work draws upon the founders' backgrounds in [[Sufism]], [[Platonism]], [[Buddhism]] and the [[Fourth Way]]. Teachers of the Diamond Approach focus on the students' specific perception of their own immediate work issues.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Who_can_teach \"Q: Who can teach the Diamond Approach?\"</ref> Presentation of a canonical body of knowledge and practice is introduced over time as required.\n\n== Life ==\nA. Hameed Ali was born in [[Kuwait]] in 1944. He was a victim of [[polio]] at 18 months old and now walks with a crutch as a result.<ref>{{cite news\n | author=[[Tony Schwartz (author)|Schwartz, Tony]]\n | title = Uncovering The Essential Self\n | work = New Age Journal\n | date = May 1995\n | url =https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/uncovering-essential-self\n | accessdate = 16 April 2020\n}}</ref> At the age of 18, he moved to the United States to study at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Ali was working on his PhD in physics when he reached a turning point in his life that led him more and more into inquiring into the psychological and spiritual aspects of human nature. His interest in the truth of human nature and the true nature of reality resulted in the creation and unfoldment of the Diamond Approach.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=A. Hameed Ali|url=https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/founders|website=diamondapproach.org}</ref>\n\n== Diamond Approach ==\nThe Diamond Approach is a spiritual teaching that utilizes a distinctive form of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. Its aim is absolute freedom that can be described as living realization, a dynamic enlightenment where transcendent truth lives personally in the world. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization.<ref>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=The Diamond Approach \u2013 Hameed Ali (A. H. Almaas)|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/|website=ahalmaas.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Ridhwan Foundation is the nonprofit spiritual organization established to support and preserve the integrity of the Diamond Approach teaching. The Ridhwan Foundation is legally recognized as a church and the role of a teacher is equivalent to that of a minister. People are ordained as spiritual teachers of the Ridhwan Foundation, which is the name given to its ministers.\n\n=== Spiritual practice as a phenomenology of being ===\nThe Diamond Approach is described as a \"response to an important need that is being felt in many quarters, a need for a spiritually informed psychology, or conversely, for a psychologically grounded spirituality. This perspective does not separate psychological and spiritual experience, and hence sees no dichotomy between depth psychology and spiritual work... This body of knowledge is not an integration or synthesis of modern depth psychology and traditional spiritual understanding. The inclination to think in terms of integration of the two is due to the prevailing belief in the dichotomy between the fields of psychology and spirituality, a dichotomy in which the Diamond Mind understanding does not participate.\" (Almaas)<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''The Void: Inner Spaciousness and Ego Structure'', Shambhala Publications, Boston MA, 1986.</ref>\n\nThe Diamond Approach, according to its followers, can be called a Phenomenology of Being that offers a precise description of the various aspects and dimensions of Spirit or Being and is also a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] psychotherapy which seeks to heal the wounds of the soul by reconnecting it to Spirit.\n\n=== Principal ideas ===\n\n==== Structure of reality ====\nIn the Diamond Approach, reality is seen as consisting of three elements: God/Being/Spirit, Soul/Self and World/Cosmos.\n\n''Being'' is understood as the inner source and true nature of reality, which is the focus of the great spiritual traditions of both East and West, and is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'', ''[[Shunyata]]'', ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Tao]]''. Being is understood as consisting of five co-emergent \"boundless dimensions\": Divine Love, Pure Presence, Nonconceptual Awareness, The Logos, and The Absolute.\n\n''Soul'' is understood to be the individual consciousness that connects the world with Being, an idea found in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. It is believed in the Diamond Approach that the soul can be experienced as a living presence that contains the thoughts, feelings and sensations usually called our \"self\".\n\n''World'' is understood as the outer manifestation of reality, the multitude of physical forms that all people are familiar with.\n\n==== Essence and the essential aspects ====\nWhile most spiritual paths conceive of Being as universal, the Diamond Approach also pays a great deal of attention to a more individual way of experiencing Being, called Essence. The concept of Essence is similar to the Hindu idea of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. While Being is the true nature of all of reality, Essence is the portion of it that forms the true and personal nature of the soul. It is experienced as a substantial fluid Presence which can differentiate into various qualities or aspects, such as compassion, strength, will, joy, peace, love, value, humanness, personalness, identity, and space.<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''Essence'' Weiser Books, Boston MA, 1986.</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm Essence & Spiritual Presence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707032123/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm |date=7 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==== Theory of holes ====\nAs our soul develops it is faced with a double challenge: it must learn to function in the World, while also remaining connected to Spirit. For various reasons, some innate and others environmental, we slowly become alienated from our Essence through the development of fixed patterns of perception and behaviour known as the personality or ego. Each of these patterns or ego structures disconnects us from a specific Essential Aspect. In other words, it is built around the \"Hole\" of this aspect. By exploring its structure, both cognitively and experientially, one eventually confronts the Hole and by going through it the lost aspect is retrieved.<ref>Ch. 2 \u2013 \"The Theory of Holes.\" Almaas, A. H. ''Diamond Heart Book 1'', Shambhala, 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe Diamond Approach uses methods which its founders learned from Claudio Naranjo. Almaas' scientific background (he studied physics at Berkeley<ref name=bio />) helps explain the emphasis on rigorous (self) inquiry. Several contexts for participation are provided, including regular one-on-one sessions with a trained teacher, seminars and participation in various formats of organized ongoing groups.<ref>[https://www.diamondapproach.org/ways-to-engage Ways to Engage with The Diamond Approach]</ref>\n\n==== Presence ====\nThe practice referred to as \"presence\" is based on two methods, learning to sense one's body (especially one's arms and legs) in an ongoing manner and regularly focusing one's attention on a point in the belly called the \"kath center\" (known in Chinese philosophy as the ''[[dantian]]'' and in Japanese culture as the [[Hara_(tanden)|hara]]). These methods help a person to become more grounded in the body and in physical reality and also, in time, to develop the ability to experience oneself as the presence of Essence.\n\n==== Inquiry ====\nThe Diamond Approach centers on practice of investigation of the self, experience and perception.  \"Inquiry\" answers the question posed by [[Socrates]]: \"How does one set up as the object of one's investigation, that about which one knows nothing?\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  One starts by wanting to find out, living a question, while recognizing preconceptions, preconditions and expectations as to the nature of what one may learn and instead attending to one's immediate or present experience. While not explicitly acknowledged as such, inquiry in effect combines (as a descriptive mechanism only, as the inquiry process is beyond mere language) the practice of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s \"transcendental phenomenological reduction, or epoch\u00e9\", with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychodynamic exploration. An important feature of inquiry is that a person learns to be aware of both the content of experience (emotions, thoughts, sensations) and the attitudes and reactions towards it. In this way the subject-object dichotomy is transcended and one learns to relate to oneself without having to create inner splits. Open-ended inquiry is both a path to, and the state of, a realized person and in time is understood to be a self-revelation of the mysteries of Being.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThe main motivation for embarking on the spiritual journey in this approach is love for the Truth. \"Truth\" refers to seeing things as they really are, which ultimately comes down to recognizing Being as the true nature of everything. Love for the truth therefore combines the traditional [[bhakti]] and [[jnana]] perspectives on spirituality.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Goal_of_DA \u2013 \"Q: What is the goal of the Diamond Approach?\"</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm Truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725054112/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Critiques ==\nThe fees associated with the retreats and other methodologies that are part of the structure of the school have been criticized.<ref name=\"dailyCamera\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_12960184 |title=New path: Ridhwan teaches new way of looking at the world |date= 17 April 2009 | work=[[Daily Camera]]|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> However, the fees are relatively low compared to other spiritual schools and retreats.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Furthermore, the founder and lead teacher, Hameed Ali, regularly points out that the Diamond Approach is only one path to truth and cannot in itself be all-encompassing.  Students are permitted and even encouraged to question the practices of the school and to explore whether the school is a good fit for them personally.\n\nIn addition to the fees associated with the retreats, participants become provisional members of the Ridhwan Foundation (legally a church). After an unspecified designated period of time, they are asked to confirm membership by paying the appropriate membership fees to the foundation. These membership fees are $160/year for students involved in the group teachings and $60/year for provisional members.\n\nThe work of Almaas has received praise from spiritual teachers and explorers such as [[John Welwood]], [[Brant Cortright]], [[Gabor Mat\u00e9]], [[Jack Kornfield]] and [[Ken Wilber]].<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (372-373)</ref> Wilber, while tentatively supportive of the Diamond Approach, disputes some details. For example, he does not agree that infants have essential experiences, maintaining that the infant exists purely in the physical, material world \u2013 \"instinctual, vital, impulsive, narcissistic, egocentric; living for food, its God is all mouth.\"<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (362\u2013363)</ref> Almaas has responded that Wilber's critique demonstrates a misinterpretation based on Wilber's own linear, four-stage categorization of spiritual development. Almaas' perspective is that infants experience a type of true nature/Spirit, but one that is very distinct from, and less integrated than, the experiences of essentially realized adults.<ref>Appendix D in Almaas, A. H. ''The Inner Journey Home'', Shambhala: Boston, 2004.</ref>\n\n== Ridhwan School ==\nThe Ridhwan School is a loosely-knit affiliation of ongoing spiritual groups founded in 1976 by Almaas. The school is dedicated to the teaching of the Diamond Approach. It is principally based in [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boulder, Colorado]] with other groups throughout North America and in parts of Europe and Australia.   Almaas is the spiritual head of the school and individual groups are taught by qualified Ridhwan teachers. The name of the school derives from the Arabic word for \"contentment\":\n\n<blockquote>\"Ridhwan is a kind of contentment which arises when you're liberated. Your personality becomes contented when you're free. Your personality itself is free from its suffering and conflict.\"<ref>''Diamond Heart, Book 2'', pg. 11 \u2013 https://www.diamondapproach.org/glossary/refinery_phrases/ridhwan \u2013 \"Book Excerpts about Ridhwan\"</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe school rejects \"quick fixes\" and graduation, and the students are engaged in learning and therapy for an indefinite period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=CSGB&d_place=CSGB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F34BBA41766BD2A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Treating the Soul for Life: School rejects 'quick fixes' |date= 23 October 1992 | work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]]|accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Elixir of Enlightenment'', 1984, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|978-0-87728-613-4}}\n*''Essence: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1986, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|0-87728-627-2}}\n*''Essence with The Elixir of Enlightenment: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1998, [[Weiser Books]], {{ISBN|1-57863-044-4}}\n*''Facets of Unity: The Enneagram of Holy Ideas'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-14-4}}\n*''Luminous Night's Journey: An Autobiographical Fragment'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-08-3}}\n*''The Inner Journey Home: Soul's Realization of the Unity of Reality'', 2004, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-1-59030-109-8}}\n*''The Power of Divine Eros''.

In its core, the Sun fuses 500 million [[metric ton]]s of hydrogen each second.]]\n[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|400 px|The [[nuclear binding energy]] curve. The formation of nuclei with masses up to [[iron-56]] releases energy, as illustrated above. ]]\n{{nuclear physics}}\n'''Nuclear fusion''' is is \na [[nuclear reaction|reaction]] in which two or more [[atomic nuclei]] are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles ([[neutrons]] or [[protons]]). The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of [[energy]]. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic \"[[Nuclear binding energy|binding energy]]\" between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Fusion is the process that powers active or \"[[main sequence]]\" [[star]]s, or other [[Absolute magnitude|high magnitude]] stars.\n\nA fusion process that produces nuclei lighter than [[iron-56]] or [[nickel-62]] will generally release energy. These elements have relatively small mass per nucleon and large [[binding energy]] per [[nucleon]]. Fusion nuclei lighter than these releases energy (an [[exothermic]] process), while fusion of heavier nuclei results in energy retained by the product nucleons, and the resulting reaction is [[endothermic]]. The opposite is true for the reverse process, [[nuclear fission]]. This means that the lighter elements, such as hydrogen and [[helium fusion|helium]], are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as [[Uranium 235|uranium]], [[thorium]] and [[Plutonium 239|plutonium]], are more fissionable. The extreme [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] event of a [[supernova]] can produce enough energy to fuse nuclei into elements heavier than iron.\n\nIn 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] suggested hydrogen-helium fusion could be the primary source of stellar energy. [[Quantum tunneling]] was discovered by [[Friedrich Hund]] in 1929, and shortly afterwards [[Robert d'Escourt Atkinson|Robert Atkinson]] and [[Fritz Houtermans]] used the measured masses of light elements to show that large amounts of energy could be released by fusing small nuclei. Building on the early experiments in [[nuclear transmutation]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]], laboratory fusion of [[Isotopes of hydrogen|hydrogen isotopes]] was accomplished by [[Mark Oliphant]] in 1932. In the remainder of that decade, the theory of the main cycle of nuclear fusion in stars was worked out by [[Hans Bethe]].  Research into fusion for military purposes began in the early 1940s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]].  Fusion was accomplished in 1951 with the [[Greenhouse Item]] nuclear test.  Nuclear fusion on a large scale in an explosion was first carried out on 1 November 1952, in the [[Ivy Mike]] [[hydrogen bomb]] test.\n\nResearch into developing many controlled fusion inside [[fusion reactors]] has been ongoing since the 1940s, but the technology is will still in its development phase.\n\n==Process==\n[[File:Deuterium-tritium fusion.svg|thumb|Fusion of [[deuterium]] with [[tritium]] creating [[helium-4]], freeing a [[neutron]], and releasing 17.59 [[Electronvolt|MeV]] as kinetic energy of the products while a corresponding amount of mass disappears, in agreement with ''kinetic E'' = \u0394''mc''<sup>2</sup>, where ''\u0394''m is the decrease in the total rest mass of particles.<ref name=Shultis>\n{{cite book\n |author1=Shultis, J.K.  |author2=Faw, R.E. \n  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002\n |title=Fundamentals of nuclear science and engineering\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO4Lmw8XoEMC&pg=PA151\n |page=151\n |publisher=[[CRC Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-8247-0834-4\n}}</ref>]]\nThe release of energy with the fusion of light elements is due to the interplay of two opposing forces: the [[nuclear force]], which combines together protons and neutrons, and the [[Coulomb force]], which causes protons to repel each other. Protons are positively charged and repel each other by the Coulomb force, but they can nonetheless stick together, demonstrating the existence of another, short-range, force referred to as nuclear attraction.<ref>[http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 Physics Flexbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228011150/http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 |date=28 December 2011 }}. Ck12.org. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.</ref> Light nuclei (or nuclei smaller than iron and nickel) are sufficiently small and proton-poor allowing the nuclear force to overcome repulsion. This is because the nucleus is sufficiently small that all nucleons feel the short-range attractive force at least as strongly as they feel the infinite-range Coulomb repulsion. Building up nuclei from lighter nuclei by fusion releases the extra energy from the net attraction of particles. [[iron peak|For larger nuclei]], however, no energy is released, since the nuclear force is short-range and cannot continue to act across  longer nuclear length scales. Thus, energy is not released with the fusion of such nuclei; instead, energy is required as input for such processes.\n\nFusion powers [[star]]s and produces virtually all elements in a process called [[nucleosynthesis]]. The Sun is a main-sequence star, and, as such, generates its energy by nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. In its core, the Sun fuses 620 million metric tons of hydrogen and makes 606 million metric tons of helium each second.<!-- Meant generally; please do not insert info about [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] and other types of specific nucleosynthesis here. --> The fusion of lighter elements in stars releases energy and the mass that always accompanies it. For example, in the fusion of two hydrogen nuclei to form helium, 0.7% of the mass is carried away in the form of kinetic energy of an [[alpha particle]] or other forms of energy, such as electromagnetic radiation.<ref name=\"bulletin1950\">{{cite journal |last=Bethe |first=Hans A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mg4AAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA99 |title=The Hydrogen Bomb |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=April 1950 |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=99\u2013104, 125\u2013|doi=10.1080/00963402.1950.11461231 |bibcode=1950BuAtS...6d..99B }}</ref>\n\nIt takes considerable energy to force nuclei to fuse, even those of the lightest element, [[hydrogen]]. When accelerated to high enough speeds, nuclei can overcome this electrostatic repulsion and be brought close enough such that the attractive [[nuclear force]] is greater than the repulsive Coulomb force. The [[strong force]] grows rapidly once the nuclei are close enough, and the fusing nucleons can essentially \"fall\" into each other and the result is fusion and net energy produced. The fusion of lighter nuclei, which creates a heavier nucleus and often a [[free neutron]] or proton, generally releases more energy than it takes to force the nuclei together; this is an [[exothermic reaction|exothermic process]] that can produce self-sustaining reactions.\n\nEnergy{{anchor|energy}} released in most [[nuclear reaction]]s is much larger than in [[chemical reaction]]s, because the [[binding energy]] that holds a nucleus together is greater than the energy that holds [[electron]]s to a nucleus. For example, the [[ionization energy]] gained by adding an electron to a hydrogen nucleus is {{val|13.6|ul=eV}}\u2014less than one-millionth of the {{val|17.6|ul=MeV}} released in the [[deuterium]]\u2013[[tritium]] (D\u2013T) reaction shown in the adjacent diagram. Fusion reactions have an [[energy density]] many times greater than [[nuclear fission]]; the reactions produce far greater energy per unit of mass even though ''individual'' fission reactions are generally much more energetic than ''individual'' fusion ones, which are themselves millions of times more energetic than chemical reactions. Only [[Direct energy conversion|direct conversion]] of [[Mass-energy equivalence|mass into energy]], such as that caused by the [[annihilation|annihilatory]] collision of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], is more energetic per unit of mass than nuclear fusion. (The complete conversion of one [[gram]] of matter would release 9\u00d710<sup>13</sup> joules of energy.)\n\nResearch into using [[fusion power|fusion]] for the production of electricity has been pursued for over 60 years. Successful accomplishment of controlled fusion has been stymied by scientific and technological difficulties; nonetheless, important progress has been made. At present, controlled fusion reactions have been unable to produce break-even (self-sustaining) controlled fusion.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Progress in Fusion\n |url=http://www.iter.org/sci/beyonditer\n |publisher=[[ITER]]\n |accessdate=2010-02-15\n}}</ref> The two most advanced approaches for it are magnetic confinement (toroid designs) and inertial confinement (laser designs).\n\nWorkable designs for a toroidal reactor that theoretically will deliver ten times more fusion energy than the amount needed to heat plasma to the required temperatures are in development (see [[ITER]]).

In the 20th century, it was recognized that the energy released from nuclear fusion reactions accounted for the longevity of stellar heat and light. The fusion of nuclei in a star, starting from its initial hydrogen and helium abundance, provides that energy and synthesizes new nuclei as a byproduct of the fusion process.  Different reaction chains are involved, depending on the mass of the star (and therefore the pressure and temperature in its core).\n\nAround 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in [[star]]s, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.<ref name=eddington>{{cite journal |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |first=A. S. |last=Eddington |journal=The Scientific Monthly |volume=11 |issue=4  |pages=297\u2013303 |date=October 1920 |doi=10.1126/science.52.1341.233 |jstor=6491|pmid=17747682 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1429642 }}</ref><ref name=eddington2>{{cite journal|bibcode=1916MNRAS..77...16E|title=On the radiative equilibrium of the stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=77|pages=16\u201335|last1=Eddington|first1=A. S.|year=1916|doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16|doi-access=free}}</ref> At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to [[Mass\u2013energy_equivalence|Einstein's equation]] ''E = mc<sup>2</sup>''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered. Eddington's paper, based on knowledge at the time, reasoned that:\n\n:# The leading theory of stellar energy, the [[contraction hypothesis]], should cause stars' rotation to visibly speed up due to [[conservation of angular momentum]]. But observations of [[Cepheid]] variable stars showed this was not happening.\n:# The only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy; Einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy. \n:# [[Francis William Aston|Francis Aston]] had also recently shown that the mass of a [[helium]] atom was about 0.8% less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would, combined, form a helium atom, suggesting that if such a combination could happen, it would release considerable energy as a byproduct.\n:# If a star contained just 5% of fusible hydrogen, it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy. (We now know that most 'ordinary' stars contain far more than 5% hydrogen)\n:# Further elements might also be fused, and other scientists had speculated that stars were the \"crucible\" in which light elements combined to create heavy elements, but without more accurate measurements of their [[atomic mass]]es nothing more could be said at the time.\n\nAll of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.\n\nThe primary source of solar energy, and similar size stars, is the fusion of hydrogen to form helium (the [[proton-proton chain]] reaction), which occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14 million kelvin. The net result is the fusion of four [[proton]]s into one [[alpha particle]], with the release of two [[positron]]s and two [[neutrino]]s (which changes two of the protons into neutrons), and energy. In heavier stars, the [[CNO cycle]] and other processes are more important. As a star uses up a substantial fraction of its hydrogen, it begins to synthesize heavier elements. The heaviest elements are synthesized by fusion that occurs as a more massive star undergoes a violent [[supernova]] at the end of its life, a process known as [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].\n\n==Requirements==\n\nA substantial energy barrier of electrostatic forces must be overcome before fusion can occur. At large distances, two naked nuclei repel one another because of the repulsive [[electrostatic force]] between their [[electric charge|positively charged]] protons. If two nuclei can be brought close enough together, however, the electrostatic repulsion can be overcome by the quantum effect in which nuclei can [[quantum tunnelling#Nuclear fusion in stars|tunnel]] through coulomb forces.\n\nWhen a [[nucleon]] such as a [[proton]] or [[neutron]] is added to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it to all the other nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but primarily to its immediate neighbours due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the [[nuclear force]] generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It is important to keep in mind that nucleons are [[Quantum physics|quantum objects]]. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.\n\nThe electrostatic force, on the other hand, is an [[inverse square law|inverse-square force]], so a proton added to a nucleus will feel an electrostatic repulsion from ''all'' the other protons in the nucleus. The electrostatic energy per nucleon due to the electrostatic force thus increases without limit as nuclei atomic number grows.\n\n[[File:Nuclear fusion forces diagram.svg|left|350px|thumb|The [[electrostatic force]] between the positively charged nuclei is repulsive, but when the separation is small enough, the quantum effect will tunnel through the wall.  Therefore, the prerequisite for fusion is that the two nuclei be brought close enough together for a long enough time for quantum tunnelling to act.]]\n\nThe net result of the opposing electrostatic and strong nuclear forces is that the binding energy per nucleon generally increases with increasing size, up to the elements [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and then decreases for heavier nuclei. Eventually, the [[binding energy]] becomes negative and very heavy nuclei (all with more than 208 nucleons, corresponding to a diameter of about 6 nucleons) are not stable. The four most tightly bound nuclei, in decreasing order of [[binding energy]] per nucleon, are {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|62}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|58}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|56}}, and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|60}}.<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin2.html#c1 The Most Tightly Bound Nuclei]. Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-17.</ref> Even though the [[isotopes of nickel|nickel isotope]], {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}}, is more stable, the [[isotopes of iron|iron isotope]] {{SimpleNuclide2|Iron|56}} is an [[order of magnitude]] more common. This is due to the fact that there is no easy way for stars to create {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}} through the alpha process.\n\nAn exception to this general trend is the [[helium-4]] nucleus, whose binding energy is higher than that of [[lithium]], the next heaviest element. This is because protons and neutrons are [[fermion]]s, which according to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] cannot exist in the same nucleus in exactly the same state. Each proton or neutron's energy state in a nucleus can accommodate both a spin up particle and a spin down particle. Helium-4 has an anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons (it is a [[doubly magic]] nucleus), so all four of its nucleons can be in the ground state. Any additional nucleons would have to go into higher energy states.  Indeed, the helium-4 nucleus is so tightly bound that it is commonly treated as a single quantum mechanical particle in nuclear physics, namely, the [[alpha particle]].\n\nThe situation is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come close enough for long enough so the strong [[nuclear force]] can take over (by way of tunneling) is the repulsive electrostatic force overcome. Consequently, even when the final energy state is lower, there is a large energy barrier that must first be overcome. It is called the [[Coulomb barrier]].\n\nThe Coulomb barrier is smallest for isotopes of hydrogen, as their nuclei contain only a single positive charge. A [[diproton]] is not stable, so neutrons must also be involved, ideally in such a way that a helium nucleus, with its extremely tight binding, is one of the products.\n\nUsing [[Tritium#Deuterium|deuterium\u2013tritium]] fuel, the resulting energy barrier is about 0.1&nbsp;MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an [[electron]] from [[hydrogen]] is 13.6&nbsp;eV, about 7500 times less energy. The (intermediate) result of the fusion is an unstable <sup>5</sup>He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with 14.1&nbsp;MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining <sup>4</sup>He nucleus is 3.5&nbsp;MeV, so the total energy liberated is 17.6&nbsp;MeV. This is many times more than what was needed to overcome the energy barrier.\n\n[[File:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The DT rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvin) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]\n\nThe reaction [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] (\u03c3) is a measure of the probability of a fusion reaction as a function of the relative velocity of the two reactant nuclei. If the reactants have a distribution of velocities, e.g. a thermal distribution, then it is useful to perform an average over the distributions of the product of cross section and velocity. This average is called the 'reactivity', denoted <\u03c3v>. The reaction rate (fusions per volume per time) is <\u03c3v> times the product of the reactant number densities:\n\n:<math>f = n_1 n_2 \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle.</math>\n\nIf a species of nuclei is reacting with a nucleus like itself, such as the DD reaction, then the product <math>n_1n_2</math> must be replaced by <math>n^2/2</math>.\n\n<math>\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle</math> increases from virtually zero at room temperatures up to meaningful magnitudes at temperatures of [[1 E-15 J|10]]\u2013[[1 E-14 J|100]]&nbsp;keV. At these temperatures, well above typical [[ion]]ization energies (13.6&nbsp;eV in the hydrogen case), the fusion reactants exist in a [[Plasma physics|plasma]] state.\n\nThe significance of <math>\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle</math> as a function of temperature in a device with a particular energy [[confinement time]] is found by considering the [[Lawson criterion]].  This is an extremely challenging barrier to overcome on Earth, which explains why fusion research has taken many years to reach the current advanced technical state.<ref name=lawson>[http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/5763/20130323/lawson-criteria-make-fusion-power-viable-iter.htm What Is The Lawson Criteria, Or How to Make Fusion Power Viable<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Artificial fusion ==\n{{main article|Fusion power}}\n\n=== Thermonuclear fusion ===\n{{main article|Thermonuclear fusion}}\nIf matter is sufficiently heated (hence being [[plasma physics|plasma]]) and confined, fusion reactions may occur due to collisions with extreme thermal kinetic energies of the particles.

Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and can be done in an efficient manner\u2014requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes. The key problem with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube [[neutron generator]]s are particularly relevant to this discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves. \n\nTo overcome the problem of bremsstrahlung radiation in Beam-target fusion, a combinatorial approach has been suggested by Tri-Alpha and Helion energy companies, this method is based on interpenetration of two oppositely directed plasmoids.<ref>J.

It also makes helium {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Helium|4}} the most common product because of its extraordinarily tight binding, although {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Helium|3}} and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Hydrogen|3}} also show up.\n;Involve low atomic number (''Z'') nuclei: This is because the electrostatic repulsion that must be overcome before the nuclei are close enough to fuse is directly related to the number of protons it contains - its atomic number.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=This implies a relationship between atomic number (Z) and activation energy (in addition to its relation to binding energy), which isn't established/cited here.}}\n;Have two reactants: At anything less than stellar densities, three body collisions are too improbable. In inertial confinement, both stellar densities and temperatures are exceeded to compensate for the shortcomings of the third parameter of the Lawson criterion, ICF's very short confinement time.\n;Have two or more products: This allows simultaneous conservation of energy and momentum without relying on the electromagnetic force.\n;Conserve both protons and neutrons: The cross sections for the weak interaction are too small.\n\nFew reactions meet these criteria. The following are those with the largest cross sections:<ref>{{cite book\n |author1=M. Kikuchi, K. Lackner  |author2=M. Q.

In most reactions with three products, the distribution of energy varies. For reactions that can result in more than one set of products, the branching ratios are given.\n\nSome reaction candidates can be eliminated at once. The D-<sup>6</sup>Li reaction has no advantage compared to [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Boron|11}} because it is roughly as difficult to burn but produces substantially more neutrons through {{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}} side reactions. There is also a [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Lithium|7}} reaction, but the cross section is far too low, except possibly when ''T''<sub>i</sub> > 1 MeV, but at such high temperatures an endothermic, direct neutron-producing reaction also becomes very significant. Finally there is also a [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} reaction, which is not only difficult to burn, but {{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} can be easily induced to split into two alpha particles and a neutron.\n\nIn addition to the fusion reactions, the following reactions with neutrons are important in order to \"breed\" tritium in \"dry\" fusion bombs and some proposed fusion reactors:\n<!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.10 by [[User:SkyLined]]\n{{Nuclide2|neutron}} + {{Nuclide2|lithium|6}} -> T + He + 4.784 MeV\nn + {{Nuclide2|lithium|7}} -> T + He + n \u2013 2.467 MeV\n\n-->:{| border=\"0\"\n|- style=\"height:2em;\"\n|[[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]]&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|6}}&nbsp;||\u2192&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + 4.784 MeV\n|- style=\"height:2em;\"\n|[[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]]&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|7}}&nbsp;||\u2192&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + [[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]] \u2013 2.467 MeV\n|}\n\nThe latter of the two equations was unknown when the U.S. conducted the [[Castle Bravo]] fusion bomb test in 1954. Being just the second fusion bomb ever tested (and the first to use lithium), the designers of the Castle Bravo \"Shrimp\" had understood the usefulness of <sup>6</sup>Li in tritium production, but had failed to recognize that <sup>7</sup>Li fission would greatly increase the yield of the bomb. While <sup>7</sup>Li has a small neutron cross-section for low neutron energies, it has a higher cross section above 5 MeV.<ref name=cross_section>[http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/atomic_and_nuclear_physics/4_7/4_7_4c.html Subsection 4.7.4c].

Retrieved on 2012-12-19.</ref>  The 15 Mt yield was 150% greater than the predicted 6 Mt and caused unexpected exposure to fallout.\n\nTo evaluate the usefulness of these reactions, in addition to the reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to know something about the [[nuclear cross section]]. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product ''nT''\u03c4 required for [[Fusion energy gain factor#Ignition|ignition]] is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> (see [[Lawson criterion]]). (A plasma is \"ignited\" if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                              !!

For instance, a reactor fueled with {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} creates some {{nuclide|deuterium}}, which is then possible to use in the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction if the energies are \"right\". An elegant idea is to combine the reactions (8) and (9). The {{nuclide|helium|3}} from reaction (8) can react with {{nuclide|lithium|6}} in reaction (9) before completely thermalizing. This produces an energetic proton, which in turn undergoes reaction (8) before thermalizing. Detailed analysis shows that this idea would not work well,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} but it is a good example of a case where the usual assumption of a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] plasma is not appropriate.\n\n===Neutronicity, confinement requirement, and power density===\n\nAny of the reactions above can in principle be the basis of [[fusion power]] production. In addition to the temperature and cross section discussed above, we must consider the total energy of the fusion products ''E''<sub>fus</sub>, the energy of the charged fusion products ''E''<sub>ch</sub>, and the atomic number ''Z'' of the non-hydrogenic reactant.\n\nSpecification of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction entails some difficulties, though. To begin with, one must average over the two branches (2i) and (2ii). More difficult is to decide how to treat the {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} products. {{nuclide|tritium}} burns so well in a deuterium plasma that it is almost impossible to extract from the plasma. The {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction is optimized at a much higher temperature, so the burnup at the optimum {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} temperature may be low. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume the {{nuclide|tritium}} but not the {{nuclide|helium|3}} gets burned up and adds its energy to the net reaction, which means the total reaction would be the sum of (2i), (2ii), and (1):\n\n:5 {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} \u2192 {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + 2 [[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]] + {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}} + [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]],  ''E''<sub>fus</sub> = 4.03+17.6+3.27 = 24.9&nbsp;MeV, ''E''<sub>ch</sub> = 4.03+3.5+0.82 = 8.35&nbsp;MeV.\n\nFor calculating the power of a reactor (in which the reaction rate is determined by the D-D step), we count the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} fusion energy ''per D-D reaction'' as ''E''<sub>fus</sub> = (4.03&nbsp;MeV + 17.6&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% + (3.27&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% = 12.5&nbsp;MeV and the energy in charged particles as ''E''<sub>ch</sub> = (4.03&nbsp;MeV + 3.5&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% + (0.82&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% = 4.2&nbsp;MeV. (Note: if the tritium ion reacts with a deuteron while it still has a large kinetic energy, then the kinetic energy of the helium-4 produced may be quite different from 3.5 MeV,<ref>A momentum and energy balance shows that if the tritium has an energy of E<sub>T</sub> (and using relative masses of 1, 3, and 4 for the neutron, tritium, and helium) then the energy of the helium can be anything from [(12E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>\u2212(5\u00d717.6MeV+2\u00d7E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>/25 to [(12E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>+(5\u00d717.6MeV+2\u00d7E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>/25. For E<sub>T</sub>=1.01&nbsp;MeV this gives a range from 1.44&nbsp;MeV to 6.73&nbsp;MeV.</ref> so this calculation of energy in charged particles is only an approximation of the average.) The amount of energy per deuteron consumed is 2/5 of this, or 5.0&nbsp;MeV (a [[specific energy]] of about 225 million [[Megajoule|MJ]] per kilogram of deuterium).\n\nAnother unique aspect of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction is that there is only one reactant, which must be taken into account when calculating the reaction rate.\n\nWith this choice, we tabulate parameters for four of the most important reactions\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                           !!''Z''!!''E''<sub>fus</sub> [MeV]!!''E''<sub>ch</sub> [MeV]!!neutronicity\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|tritium}}                  ||  1  || 17.6 || 3.5 || 0.80\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}}                ||  1  || 12.5 || 4.2 || 0.66\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}                   ||  2  || 18.3 ||18.3 || \u22480.05\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|boron|11}}              ||  5  || 8.7  || 8.7 || \u22480.001\n|}\n\nThe last column is the '''[[aneutronic fusion|neutronicity]]''' of the reaction, the fraction of the fusion energy released as neutrons. This is an important indicator of the magnitude of the problems associated with neutrons like radiation damage, biological shielding, remote handling, and safety. For the first two reactions it is calculated as (''E''<sub>fus</sub>-''E''<sub>ch</sub>)/''E''<sub>fus</sub>. For the last two reactions, where this calculation would give zero, the values quoted are rough estimates based on side reactions that produce neutrons in a plasma in thermal equilibrium.\n\nOf course, the reactants should also be mixed in the optimal proportions. This is the case when each reactant ion plus its associated electrons accounts for half the pressure. Assuming that the total pressure is fixed, this means that particle density of the non-hydrogenic ion is smaller than that of the hydrogenic ion by a factor 2/(''Z''+1). Therefore, the rate for these reactions is reduced by the same factor, on top of any differences in the values of <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup>. On the other hand, because the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction has only one reactant, its rate is twice as high as when the fuel is divided between two different hydrogenic species, thus creating a more efficient reaction.\n\nThus there is a \"penalty\" of (2/(Z+1)) for non-hydrogenic fuels arising from the fact that they require more electrons, which take up pressure without participating in the fusion reaction. (It is usually a good assumption that the electron temperature will be nearly equal to the ion temperature. Some authors, however discuss the possibility that the electrons could be maintained substantially colder than the ions. In such a case, known as a \"hot ion mode\", the \"penalty\" would not apply.) There is at the same time a \"bonus\" of a factor 2 for {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} because each ion can react with any of the other ions, not just a fraction of them.\n\nWe can now compare these reactions in the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                     !!<\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup>!!penalty/bonus !!inverse reactivity!!Lawson criterion!!power density (W/m<sup>3</sup>/kPa<sup>2</sup>)!!inverse ratio of power density\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|tritium}}    || 1.24\u00d710<sup>\u221224</sup> ||  1  ||    1 ||   1 || 34     ||    1\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}}  || 1.28\u00d710<sup>\u221226</sup> ||  2  ||   48 ||  30 ||  0.5   ||   68\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}     || 2.24\u00d710<sup>\u221226</sup> || 2/3 ||   83 ||  16 ||  0.43  ||   80\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|lithium|6}}        || 1.46\u00d710<sup>\u221227</sup> || 1/2 || 1700 ||     || 0.005 || 6800\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|boron|11}}        || 3.01\u00d710<sup>\u221227</sup> || 1/3 || 1240 || 500 || 0.014 || 2500\n|}\n\nThe maximum value of <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> is taken from a previous table. The \"penalty/bonus\" factor is that related to a non-hydrogenic reactant or a single-species reaction. The values in the column \"inverse reactivity\" are found by dividing 1.24{{e|-24}} by the product of the second and third columns. It indicates the factor by which the other reactions occur more slowly than the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction under comparable conditions. The column \"[[Lawson criterion]]\" weights these results with ''E''<sub>ch</sub> and gives an indication of how much more difficult it is to achieve ignition with these reactions, relative to the difficulty for the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction. The next-to-last column is labeled \"power density\" and weights the practical reactivity by ''E''<sub>fus</sub>. The final column indicates how much lower the fusion power density of the other reactions is compared to the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction and can be considered a measure of the economic potential.\n\n===Bremsstrahlung losses in quasineutral, isotropic plasmas===\nThe ions undergoing fusion in many systems will essentially never occur alone but will be mixed with [[electron]]s that in aggregate neutralize the ions' bulk [[electrical charge]] and form a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The electrons will generally have a temperature comparable to or greater than that of the ions, so they will collide with the ions and emit [[x-ray]] radiation of 10\u201330 keV energy, a process known as [[Bremsstrahlung]].\n\nThe huge size of the Sun and stars means that the x-rays produced in this process will not escape and will deposit their energy back into the plasma. They are said to be [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] to x-rays. But any terrestrial fusion reactor will be [[Optical depth|optically thin]] for x-rays of this energy range. X-rays are difficult to reflect but they are effectively absorbed (and converted into heat) in less than mm thickness of stainless steel (which is part of a reactor's shield). This means the bremsstrahlung process is carrying energy out of the plasma, cooling it.\n \nThe ratio of fusion power produced to x-ray radiation lost to walls is an important figure of merit. This ratio is generally maximized at a much higher temperature than that which maximizes the power density (see the previous subsection). The following table shows estimates of the optimum temperature and the power ratio at that temperature for several reactions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                    !!''T''<sub>i</sub> (keV)!!''P''<sub>fusion</sub>/''P''<sub>Bremsstrahlung</sub>\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|tritium}}   ||   50 || 140\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} ||  500 ||   2.9\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}    ||  100 ||   5.3\n|-\n|{{nuclide|helium|3}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}       || 1000 ||   0.72\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|lithium|6}}      ||  800 ||   0.21\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|boron|11}}       ||  300 ||   0.57\n|}\n\nThe actual ratios of fusion to Bremsstrahlung power will likely be significantly lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that the energy of the fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves ''must'' remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and ''will'' remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.\n\nThe temperatures maximizing the fusion power compared to the Bremsstrahlung are in every case higher than the temperature that maximizes the power density and minimizes the required value of the [[Lawson criterion|fusion triple product]]. This will not change the optimum operating point for {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} very much because the Bremsstrahlung fraction is low, but it will push the other fuels into regimes where the power density relative to {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} is even lower and the required confinement even more difficult to achieve. For {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} and {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, Bremsstrahlung losses will be a serious, possibly prohibitive problem. For {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|6}} and [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|boron|11}} the Bremsstrahlung losses appear to make a fusion reactor using these fuels with a quasineutral, isotropic plasma impossible.

Estimating the radius of an atomic nuclei as about one femtometer, the energy needed for fusion of two hydrogen is:\n\n<math>E_{\\text{thresh}}= \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z_1 Z_2}{r} \\xrightarrow{\\text{2 protons}} \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{1 \\text{ fm}} \\approx 1.4 \\text{ MeV}</math>\n\nThis would imply that for the core of the sun, which has a [[Boltzmann distribution]] with a temperature of around 1.4 keV, the probability hydrogen would reach the threshold is <math>10^{-290}</math>, that is, fusion would never occur. However, fusion in the sun does occur due to quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Parameterization of cross section ===\nThe probability that fusion occurs is greatly increased compared to the classical picture, thanks to the smearing of the effective radius as the [[Matter wave|DeBroglie wavelength]] as well as [[quantum tunnelling]] through the potential barrier. To determine the rate of fusion reactions, the value of most interest is the [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]], which describes the probability that particle will fuse by giving a characteristic area of interaction.  An estimation of the fusion cross sectional area is often broken into three pieces:\n\n:<math>\\sigma \\approx \\sigma_{geometry} \\times T \\times R</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\sigma_{geometry} </math> is the geometric cross section, {{mvar|T}} is the barrier transparency and {{mvar|R}} is the reaction characteristics of the reaction. \n\n<math>\\sigma_{geometry} </math> is of the order of the square of the de-Broglie wavelength <math>\\sigma_{geometry} \\approx \\lambda^2 = \\bigg( \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_r v} \\bigg)^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} </math> where <math>m_r </math> is the reduced mass of the system and <math>\\epsilon  </math> is the center of mass energy of the system. \n\n{{mvar|T}} can be approximated by the Gamow transparency, which has the form: <math>T \\approx e^ {- \\sqrt{\\epsilon_G /\\epsilon} } </math> where <math>\\epsilon_G = ( \\pi \\alpha Z_1 Z_2)^2 \\times 2 m_r c^2 </math> is the [[Gamow factor]] and comes from estimating the quantum tunneling probability through the potential barrier. \n\n{{mvar|R}} contains all the nuclear physics of the specific reaction and takes very different values depending on the nature of the interaction. However, for most reactions, the variation of <math>R(\\epsilon)</math> is small compared to the variation from the Gamow factor and so is approximated by a function called the [[S-factor|Astrophysical S-factor]], <math>S(\\epsilon)</math>, which is weakly varying in energy. Putting these dependencies together, one approximation for the fusion cross section as a function of energy takes the form:\n\n:<math>\\sigma(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{S(\\epsilon)}{\\epsilon} e^{ -  \\epsilon_G / \\sqrt{\\epsilon}}</math>\n\nMore detailed forms of the cross section can be derived through nuclear physics based models and [[R-matrix]] theory.\n\n=== Formulas of fusion cross sections ===\nThe Naval Research Lab's plasma physics formulary<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/online_pubs/NRL_FORMULARY_13.pdf|title=NRL PLASMA FORMULARY|last=Huba|first=J.|date=2003|website=MIT Catalog|access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref> gives the total cross section in [[Barn_(unit)|barns]] as a function of the energy (in keV) of the incident particle towards a target ion at rest fit by the formula:\n\n<math>\\sigma^{NRL}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{A_5 + \\big( (A_4 - A_3 \\epsilon)^2 + 1) \\big)^{-1} A_2}{ \\epsilon (e^{A_1 \\epsilon^{-1/2} }-1)}</math> with the following coefficient values:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+NRL Formulary Cross Section Coefficients\n!\n!DT(1)\n!DD(2i)\n!DD(2ii)\n!DHe<sup>3</sup>(3)\n!TT(4)\n!THe<sup>3</sup>(6)\n|-\n|A1\n|45.95\n|46.097\n|47.88\n|89.27\n|38.39\n|123.1\n|-\n|A2\n|50200\n|372\n|482\n|25900\n|448\n|11250\n|-\n|A3\n|1.368e-2\n|4.36e-4\n|3.08e-4\n|3.98e-3\n|1.02e-3\n|0\n|-\n|A4\n|1.076\n|1.22\n|1.177\n|1.297\n|2.09\n|0\n|-\n|A5\n|409\n|0\n|0\n|647\n|0\n|0\n|}\nBosch-Hale<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Improved formulas for fusion cross-sections and thermal reactivities|journal=Nuclear Fusion|volume=32|issue=4|pages=611\u2013631|last=Bosch|first=H.

In its core, the Sun fuses 500 million [[metric ton]]s of hydrogen each second.]]\n[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|400 px|The [[nuclear binding energy]] curve. The formation of nuclei with masses up to [[iron-56]] releases energy, as illustrated above. ]]\n{{nuclear physics}}\n'''Nuclear fusion''' is a [[nuclear reaction|reaction]] in which two or more [[atomic nuclei]] are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles ([[neutrons]] or [[protons]]). The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of [[energy]]. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic \"[[Nuclear binding energy|binding energy]]\" between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Fusion is the process that powers active or \"[[main sequence]]\" [[star]]s, or other [[Absolute magnitude|high magnitude]] stars.\n\nA fusion process that produces nuclei lighter than [[iron-56]] or [[nickel-62]] will generally release energy. These elements have relatively small mass per nucleon and large [[binding energy]] per [[nucleon]]. Fusion nuclei lighter than these releases energy (an [[exothermic]] process), while fusion of heavier nuclei results in energy retained by the product nucleons, and the resulting reaction is [[endothermic]]. The opposite is true for the reverse process, [[nuclear fission]]. This means that the lighter elements, such as hydrogen and [[helium fusion|helium]], are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as [[Uranium 235|uranium]], [[thorium]] and [[Plutonium 239|plutonium]], are more fissionable. The extreme [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] event of a [[supernova]] can produce enough energy to fuse nuclei into elements heavier than iron.\n\nIn 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] suggested hydrogen-helium fusion could be the primary source of stellar energy. [[Quantum tunneling]] was discovered by [[Friedrich Hund]] in 1929, and shortly afterwards [[Robert d'Escourt Atkinson|Robert Atkinson]] and [[Fritz Houtermans]] used the measured masses of light elements to show that large amounts of energy could be released by fusing small nuclei. Building on the early experiments in [[nuclear transmutation]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]], laboratory fusion of [[Isotopes of hydrogen|hydrogen isotopes]] was accomplished by [[Mark Oliphant]] in 1932. In the remainder of that decade, the theory of the main cycle of nuclear fusion in stars was worked out by [[Hans Bethe]].  Research into fusion for military purposes began in the early 1940s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]].  Fusion was accomplished in 1951 with the [[Greenhouse Item]] nuclear test.  Nuclear fusion on a large scale in an explosion was first carried out on 1 November 1952, in the [[Ivy Mike]] [[hydrogen bomb]] test.\n\nResearch into developing controlled fusion inside [[fusion reactors]] has been ongoing since the 1940s, but the technology is still in its development phase.\n\n==Process==\n[[File:Deuterium-tritium fusion.svg|thumb|Fusion of [[deuterium]] with [[tritium]] creating [[helium-4]], freeing a [[neutron]], and releasing 17.59 [[Electronvolt|MeV]] as kinetic energy of the products while a corresponding amount of mass disappears, in agreement with ''kinetic E'' = \u0394''mc''<sup>2</sup>, where ''\u0394''m is the decrease in the total rest mass of particles.<ref name=Shultis>\n{{cite book\n |author1=Shultis, J.K.  |author2=Faw, R.E. \n  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002\n |title=Fundamentals of nuclear science and engineering\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO4Lmw8XoEMC&pg=PA151\n |page=151\n |publisher=[[CRC Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-8247-0834-4\n}}</ref>]]\nThe release of energy with the fusion of light elements is due to the interplay of two opposing forces: the [[nuclear force]], which combines together protons and neutrons, and the [[Coulomb force]], which causes protons to repel each other. Protons are positively charged and repel each other by the Coulomb force, but they can nonetheless stick together, demonstrating the existence of another, short-range, force referred to as nuclear attraction.<ref>[http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 Physics Flexbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228011150/http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 |date=28 December 2011 }}. Ck12.org. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.</ref> Light nuclei (or nuclei smaller than iron and nickel) are sufficiently small and proton-poor allowing the nuclear force to overcome repulsion. This is because the nucleus is sufficiently small that all nucleons feel the short-range attractive force at least as strongly as they feel the infinite-range Coulomb repulsion. Building up nuclei from lighter nuclei by fusion releases the extra energy from the net attraction of particles. [[iron peak|For larger nuclei]], however, no energy is released, since the nuclear force is short-range and cannot continue to act across  longer nuclear length scales. Thus, energy is not released with the fusion of such nuclei; instead, energy is required as input for such processes.\n\nFusion powers [[star]]s and produces virtually all elements in a process called [[nucleosynthesis]]. The Sun is a main-sequence star, and, as such, generates its energy by nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. In its core, the Sun fuses 620 million metric tons of hydrogen and makes 606 million metric tons of helium each second.<!-- Meant generally; please do not insert info about [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] and other types of specific nucleosynthesis here. --> The fusion of lighter elements in stars releases energy and the mass that always accompanies it.

When accelerated to high enough speeds, nuclei can overcome this electrostatic repulsion and be brought close enough such that the attractive [[nuclear force]] is greater than the repulsive Coulomb force. The [[strong force]] grows rapidly once the nuclei are close enough, and the fusing nucleons can essentially \"fall\" into each other and the result is fusion and net energy produced. The fusion of lighter nuclei, which creates a heavier nucleus and often a [[free neutron]] or proton, generally releases more energy than it takes to force the nuclei together; this is an [[exothermic reaction|exothermic process]] that can produce self-sustaining reactions.\n\nEnergy{{anchor|energy}} released in most [[nuclear reaction]]s is much larger than in [[chemical reaction]]s, because the [[binding energy]] that holds a nucleus together is greater than the energy that holds [[electron]]s to a nucleus. For example, the [[ionization energy]] gained by adding an electron to a hydrogen nucleus is {{val|13.6|ul=eV}}\u2014less than one-millionth of the {{val|17.6|ul=MeV}} released in the [[deuterium]]\u2013[[tritium]] (D\u2013T) reaction shown in the adjacent diagram. Fusion reactions have an [[energy density]] many times greater than [[nuclear fission]]; the reactions produce far greater energy per unit of mass even though ''individual'' fission reactions are generally much more energetic than ''individual'' fusion ones, which are themselves millions of times more energetic than chemical reactions. Only [[Direct energy conversion|direct conversion]] of [[Mass-energy equivalence|mass into energy]], such as that caused by the [[annihilation|annihilatory]] collision of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], is more energetic per unit of mass than nuclear fusion. (The complete conversion of one [[gram]] of matter would release 9\u00d710<sup>13</sup> joules of energy.)\n\nResearch into using [[fusion power|fusion]] for the production of electricity has been pursued for over 60 years. Successful accomplishment of controlled fusion has been stymied by scientific and technological difficulties; nonetheless, important progress has been made.

In the 20th century, it was recognized that the energy released from nuclear fusion reactions accounted for the longevity of stellar heat and light. The fusion of nuclei in a star, starting from its initial hydrogen and helium abundance, provides that energy and synthesizes new nuclei as a byproduct of the fusion process.  Different reaction chains are involved, depending on the mass of the star (and therefore the pressure and temperature in its core).\n\nAround 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in [[star]]s, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.<ref name=eddington>{{cite journal |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |first=A. S. |last=Eddington |journal=The Scientific Monthly |volume=11 |issue=4  |pages=297\u2013303 |date=October 1920 |doi=10.1126/science.52.1341.233 |jstor=6491|pmid=17747682 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1429642 }}</ref><ref name=eddington2>{{cite journal|bibcode=1916MNRAS..77...16E|title=On the radiative equilibrium of the stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=77|pages=16\u201335|last1=Eddington|first1=A. S.|year=1916|doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16|doi-access=free}}</ref> At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to [[Mass\u2013energy_equivalence|Einstein's equation]] ''E = mc<sup>2</sup>''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered. Eddington's paper, based on knowledge at the time, reasoned that:\n\n:# The leading theory of stellar energy, the [[contraction hypothesis]], should cause stars' rotation to visibly speed up due to [[conservation of angular momentum]]. But observations of [[Cepheid]] variable stars showed this was not happening.\n:# The only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy; Einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy. \n:# [[Francis William Aston|Francis Aston]] had also recently shown that the mass of a [[helium]] atom was about 0.8% less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would, combined, form a helium atom, suggesting that if such a combination could happen, it would release considerable energy as a byproduct.\n:# If a star contained just 5% of fusible hydrogen, it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy. (We now know that most 'ordinary' stars contain far more than 5% hydrogen)\n:# Further elements might also be fused, and other scientists had speculated that stars were the \"crucible\" in which light elements combined to create heavy elements, but without more accurate measurements of their [[atomic mass]]es nothing more could be said at the time.\n\nAll of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.\n\nThe primary source of solar energy, and similar size stars, is the fusion of hydrogen to form helium (the [[proton-proton chain]] reaction), which occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14 million kelvin. The net result is the fusion of four [[proton]]s into one [[alpha particle]], with the release of two [[positron]]s and two [[neutrino]]s (which changes two of the protons into neutrons), and energy. In heavier stars, the [[CNO cycle]] and other processes are more important. As a star uses up a substantial fraction of its hydrogen, it begins to synthesize heavier elements. The heaviest elements are synthesized by fusion that occurs as a more massive star undergoes a violent [[supernova]] at the end of its life, a process known as [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].\n\n==Requirements==\n\nA substantial energy barrier of electrostatic forces must be overcome before fusion can occur. At large distances, two naked nuclei repel one another because of the repulsive [[electrostatic force]] between their [[electric charge|positively charged]] protons. If two nuclei can be brought close enough together, however, the electrostatic repulsion can be overcome by the quantum effect in which nuclei can [[quantum tunnelling#Nuclear fusion in stars|tunnel]] through coulomb forces.\n\nWhen a [[nucleon]] such as a [[proton]] or [[neutron]] is added to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it to all the other nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but primarily to its immediate neighbours due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the [[nuclear force]] generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It is important to keep in mind that nucleons are [[Quantum physics|quantum objects]]. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.\n\nThe electrostatic force, on the other hand, is an [[inverse square law|inverse-square force]], so a proton added to a nucleus will feel an electrostatic repulsion from ''all'' the other protons in the nucleus. The electrostatic energy per nucleon due to the electrostatic force thus increases without limit as nuclei atomic number grows.\n\n[[File:Nuclear fusion forces diagram.svg|left|350px|thumb|The [[electrostatic force]] between the positively charged nuclei is repulsive, but when the separation is small enough, the quantum effect will tunnel through the wall.  Therefore, the prerequisite for fusion is that the two nuclei be brought close enough together for a long enough time for quantum tunnelling to act.]]\n\nThe net result of the opposing electrostatic and strong nuclear forces is that the binding energy per nucleon generally increases with increasing size, up to the elements [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and then decreases for heavier nuclei. Eventually, the [[binding energy]] becomes negative and very heavy nuclei (all with more than 208 nucleons, corresponding to a diameter of about 6 nucleons) are not stable. The four most tightly bound nuclei, in decreasing order of [[binding energy]] per nucleon, are {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|62}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|58}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|56}}, and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|60}}.<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin2.html#c1 The Most Tightly Bound Nuclei]. Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-17.</ref> Even though the [[isotopes of nickel|nickel isotope]], {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}}, is more stable, the [[isotopes of iron|iron isotope]] {{SimpleNuclide2|Iron|56}} is an [[order of magnitude]] more common. This is due to the fact that there is no easy way for stars to create {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}} through the alpha process.\n\nAn exception to this general trend is the [[helium-4]] nucleus, whose binding energy is higher than that of [[lithium]], the next heaviest element. This is because protons and neutrons are [[fermion]]s, which according to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] cannot exist in the same nucleus in exactly the same state. Each proton or neutron's energy state in a nucleus can accommodate both a spin up particle and a spin down particle. Helium-4 has an anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons (it is a [[doubly magic]] nucleus), so all four of its nucleons can be in the ground state. Any additional nucleons would have to go into higher energy states.  Indeed, the helium-4 nucleus is so tightly bound that it is commonly treated as a single quantum mechanical particle in nuclear physics, namely, the [[alpha particle]].\n\nThe situation is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come close enough for long enough so the strong [[nuclear force]] can take over (by way of tunneling) is the repulsive electrostatic force overcome. Consequently, even when the final energy state is lower, there is a large energy barrier that must first be overcome. It is called the [[Coulomb barrier]].\n\nThe Coulomb barrier is smallest for isotopes of hydrogen, as their nuclei contain only a single positive charge. A [[diproton]] is not stable, so neutrons must also be involved, ideally in such a way that a helium nucleus, with its extremely tight binding, is one of the products.\n\nUsing [[Tritium#Deuterium|deuterium\u2013tritium]] fuel, the resulting energy barrier is about 0.1&nbsp;MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an [[electron]] from [[hydrogen]] is 13.6&nbsp;eV, about 7500 times less energy. The (intermediate) result of the fusion is an unstable <sup>5</sup>He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with 14.1&nbsp;MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining <sup>4</sup>He nucleus is 3.5&nbsp;MeV, so the total energy liberated is 17.6&nbsp;MeV. This is many times more than what was needed to overcome the energy barrier.\n\n[[File:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The DT rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvin) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]\n\nThe reaction [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] (\u03c3) is a measure of the probability of a fusion reaction as a function of the relative velocity of the two reactant nuclei. If the reactants have a distribution of velocities, e.g. a thermal distribution, then it is useful to perform an average over the distributions of the product of cross section and velocity. This average is called the 'reactivity', denoted <\u03c3v>. The reaction rate (fusions per volume per time) is <\u03c3v> times the product of the reactant number densities:\n\n:<math>f = n_1 n_2 \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle.</math>\n\nIf a species of nuclei is reacting with a nucleus like itself, such as the DD reaction, then the product <math>n_1n_2</math> must be replaced by <math>n^2/2</math>.\n\n<math>\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle</math> increases from virtually zero at room temperatures up to meaningful magnitudes at temperatures of [[1 E-15 J|10]]\u2013[[1 E-14 J|100]]&nbsp;keV. At these temperatures, well above typical [[ion]]ization energies (13.6&nbsp;eV in the hydrogen case), the fusion reactants exist in a [[Plasma physics|plasma]] state.\n\nThe significance of <math>\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle</math> as a function of temperature in a device with a particular energy [[confinement time]] is found by considering the [[Lawson criterion]].  This is an extremely challenging barrier to overcome on Earth, which explains why fusion research has taken many years to reach the current advanced technical state.<ref name=lawson>[http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/5763/20130323/lawson-criteria-make-fusion-power-viable-iter.htm What Is The Lawson Criteria, Or How to Make Fusion Power Viable<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Artificial fusion ==\n{{main article|Fusion power}}\n\n=== Thermonuclear fusion ===\n{{main article|Thermonuclear fusion}}\nIf matter is sufficiently heated (hence being [[plasma physics|plasma]]) and confined, fusion reactions may occur due to collisions with extreme thermal kinetic energies of the particles.

Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and can be done in an efficient manner\u2014requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes. The key problem with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube [[neutron generator]]s are particularly relevant to this discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves. \n\nTo overcome the problem of bremsstrahlung radiation in Beam-target fusion, a combinatorial approach has been suggested by Tri-Alpha and Helion energy companies, this method is based on interpenetration of two oppositely directed plasmoids.<ref>J.

Because nuclear reaction rates depend on density as well as temperature and most fusion schemes operate at relatively low densities, those methods are strongly dependent on higher temperatures. The fusion rate as a function of temperature (exp(\u2212''E''/''kT'')), leads to the need to achieve temperatures in terrestrial reactors 10\u2013100 times higher temperatures than in stellar interiors: ''T'' \u2248 0.1\u20131.0\u00d710<sup>9</sup> K.\n\n===Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions===\n{{main article|Fusion power#Fuels}}\nIn artificial fusion, the primary fuel is not constrained to be protons and higher temperatures can be used, so reactions with larger cross-sections are chosen. Another concern is the production of neutrons, which activate the reactor structure radiologically, but also have the advantages of allowing volumetric extraction of the fusion energy and [[tritium]] breeding. Reactions that release no neutrons are referred to as [[Aneutronic fusion|''aneutronic'']].\n\nTo be a useful energy source, a fusion reaction must satisfy several criteria. It must:\n\n;Be [[exothermic]]: This limits the reactants to the low ''Z'' (number of protons) side of the [[Nuclear binding energy#Nuclear binding energy curve|curve of binding energy]]. It also makes helium {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Helium|4}} the most common product because of its extraordinarily tight binding, although {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Helium|3}} and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Hydrogen|3}} also show up.\n;Involve low atomic number (''Z'') nuclei: This is because the electrostatic repulsion that must be overcome before the nuclei are close enough to fuse is directly related to the number of protons it contains - its atomic number.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=This implies a relationship between atomic number (Z) and activation energy (in addition to its relation to binding energy), which isn't established/cited here.}}\n;Have two reactants: At anything less than stellar densities, three body collisions are too improbable. In inertial confinement, both stellar densities and temperatures are exceeded to compensate for the shortcomings of the third parameter of the Lawson criterion, ICF's very short confinement time.\n;Have two or more products: This allows simultaneous conservation of energy and momentum without relying on the electromagnetic force.\n;Conserve both protons and neutrons: The cross sections for the weak interaction are too small.\n\nFew reactions meet these criteria. The following are those with the largest cross sections:<ref>{{cite book\n |author1=M. Kikuchi, K. Lackner  |author2=M. Q.

In most reactions with three products, the distribution of energy varies. For reactions that can result in more than one set of products, the branching ratios are given.\n\nSome reaction candidates can be eliminated at once. The D-<sup>6</sup>Li reaction has no advantage compared to [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Boron|11}} because it is roughly as difficult to burn but produces substantially more neutrons through {{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}} side reactions. There is also a [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Lithium|7}} reaction, but the cross section is far too low, except possibly when ''T''<sub>i</sub> > 1 MeV, but at such high temperatures an endothermic, direct neutron-producing reaction also becomes very significant. Finally there is also a [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} reaction, which is not only difficult to burn, but {{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} can be easily induced to split into two alpha particles and a neutron.\n\nIn addition to the fusion reactions, the following reactions with neutrons are important in order to \"breed\" tritium in \"dry\" fusion bombs and some proposed fusion reactors:\n<!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.10 by [[User:SkyLined]]\n{{Nuclide2|neutron}} + {{Nuclide2|lithium|6}} -> T + He + 4.784 MeV\nn + {{Nuclide2|lithium|7}} -> T + He + n \u2013 2.467 MeV\n\n-->:{| border=\"0\"\n|- style=\"height:2em;\"\n|[[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]]&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|6}}&nbsp;||\u2192&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + 4.784 MeV\n|- style=\"height:2em;\"\n|[[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]]&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|7}}&nbsp;||\u2192&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + [[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]] \u2013 2.467 MeV\n|}\n\nThe latter of the two equations was unknown when the U.S. conducted the [[Castle Bravo]] fusion bomb test in 1954. Being just the second fusion bomb ever tested (and the first to use lithium), the designers of the Castle Bravo \"Shrimp\" had understood the usefulness of <sup>6</sup>Li in tritium production, but had failed to recognize that <sup>7</sup>Li fission would greatly increase the yield of the bomb. While <sup>7</sup>Li has a small neutron cross-section for low neutron energies, it has a higher cross section above 5 MeV.<ref name=cross_section>[http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/atomic_and_nuclear_physics/4_7/4_7_4c.html Subsection 4.7.4c].

Retrieved on 2012-12-19.</ref>  The 15 Mt yield was 150% greater than the predicted 6 Mt and caused unexpected exposure to fallout.\n\nTo evaluate the usefulness of these reactions, in addition to the reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to know something about the [[nuclear cross section]]. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product ''nT''\u03c4 required for [[Fusion energy gain factor#Ignition|ignition]] is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> (see [[Lawson criterion]]). (A plasma is \"ignited\" if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                              !!

For instance, a reactor fueled with {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} creates some {{nuclide|deuterium}}, which is then possible to use in the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction if the energies are \"right\". An elegant idea is to combine the reactions (8) and (9). The {{nuclide|helium|3}} from reaction (8) can react with {{nuclide|lithium|6}} in reaction (9) before completely thermalizing. This produces an energetic proton, which in turn undergoes reaction (8) before thermalizing. Detailed analysis shows that this idea would not work well,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} but it is a good example of a case where the usual assumption of a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] plasma is not appropriate.\n\n===Neutronicity, confinement requirement, and power density===\n\nAny of the reactions above can in principle be the basis of [[fusion power]] production. In addition to the temperature and cross section discussed above, we must consider the total energy of the fusion products ''E''<sub>fus</sub>, the energy of the charged fusion products ''E''<sub>ch</sub>, and the atomic number ''Z'' of the non-hydrogenic reactant.\n\nSpecification of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction entails some difficulties, though. To begin with, one must average over the two branches (2i) and (2ii). More difficult is to decide how to treat the {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} products. {{nuclide|tritium}} burns so well in a deuterium plasma that it is almost impossible to extract from the plasma. The {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction is optimized at a much higher temperature, so the burnup at the optimum {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} temperature may be low. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume the {{nuclide|tritium}} but not the {{nuclide|helium|3}} gets burned up and adds its energy to the net reaction, which means the total reaction would be the sum of (2i), (2ii), and (1):\n\n:5 {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} \u2192 {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + 2 [[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]] + {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}} + [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]],  ''E''<sub>fus</sub> = 4.03+17.6+3.27 = 24.9&nbsp;MeV, ''E''<sub>ch</sub> = 4.03+3.5+0.82 = 8.35&nbsp;MeV.\n\nFor calculating the power of a reactor (in which the reaction rate is determined by the D-D step), we count the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} fusion energy ''per D-D reaction'' as ''E''<sub>fus</sub> = (4.03&nbsp;MeV + 17.6&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% + (3.27&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% = 12.5&nbsp;MeV and the energy in charged particles as ''E''<sub>ch</sub> = (4.03&nbsp;MeV + 3.5&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% + (0.82&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% = 4.2&nbsp;MeV. (Note: if the tritium ion reacts with a deuteron while it still has a large kinetic energy, then the kinetic energy of the helium-4 produced may be quite different from 3.5 MeV,<ref>A momentum and energy balance shows that if the tritium has an energy of E<sub>T</sub> (and using relative masses of 1, 3, and 4 for the neutron, tritium, and helium) then the energy of the helium can be anything from [(12E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>\u2212(5\u00d717.6MeV+2\u00d7E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>/25 to [(12E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>+(5\u00d717.6MeV+2\u00d7E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>/25. For E<sub>T</sub>=1.01&nbsp;MeV this gives a range from 1.44&nbsp;MeV to 6.73&nbsp;MeV.</ref> so this calculation of energy in charged particles is only an approximation of the average.) The amount of energy per deuteron consumed is 2/5 of this, or 5.0&nbsp;MeV (a [[specific energy]] of about 225 million [[Megajoule|MJ]] per kilogram of deuterium).\n\nAnother unique aspect of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction is that there is only one reactant, which must be taken into account when calculating the reaction rate.\n\nWith this choice, we tabulate parameters for four of the most important reactions\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                           !!''Z''!!''E''<sub>fus</sub> [MeV]!!''E''<sub>ch</sub> [MeV]!!neutronicity\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|tritium}}                  ||  1  || 17.6 || 3.5 || 0.80\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}}                ||  1  || 12.5 || 4.2 || 0.66\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}                   ||  2  || 18.3 ||18.3 || \u22480.05\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|boron|11}}              ||  5  || 8.7  || 8.7 || \u22480.001\n|}\n\nThe last column is the '''[[aneutronic fusion|neutronicity]]''' of the reaction, the fraction of the fusion energy released as neutrons. This is an important indicator of the magnitude of the problems associated with neutrons like radiation damage, biological shielding, remote handling, and safety. For the first two reactions it is calculated as (''E''<sub>fus</sub>-''E''<sub>ch</sub>)/''E''<sub>fus</sub>. For the last two reactions, where this calculation would give zero, the values quoted are rough estimates based on side reactions that produce neutrons in a plasma in thermal equilibrium.\n\nOf course, the reactants should also be mixed in the optimal proportions. This is the case when each reactant ion plus its associated electrons accounts for half the pressure. Assuming that the total pressure is fixed, this means that particle density of the non-hydrogenic ion is smaller than that of the hydrogenic ion by a factor 2/(''Z''+1). Therefore, the rate for these reactions is reduced by the same factor, on top of any differences in the values of <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup>. On the other hand, because the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction has only one reactant, its rate is twice as high as when the fuel is divided between two different hydrogenic species, thus creating a more efficient reaction.\n\nThus there is a \"penalty\" of (2/(Z+1)) for non-hydrogenic fuels arising from the fact that they require more electrons, which take up pressure without participating in the fusion reaction. (It is usually a good assumption that the electron temperature will be nearly equal to the ion temperature. Some authors, however discuss the possibility that the electrons could be maintained substantially colder than the ions. In such a case, known as a \"hot ion mode\", the \"penalty\" would not apply.) There is at the same time a \"bonus\" of a factor 2 for {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} because each ion can react with any of the other ions, not just a fraction of them.\n\nWe can now compare these reactions in the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                     !!<\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup>!!penalty/bonus !!inverse reactivity!!Lawson criterion!!power density (W/m<sup>3</sup>/kPa<sup>2</sup>)!!inverse ratio of power density\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|tritium}}    || 1.24\u00d710<sup>\u221224</sup> ||  1  ||    1 ||   1 || 34     ||    1\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}}  || 1.28\u00d710<sup>\u221226</sup> ||  2  ||   48 ||  30 ||  0.5   ||   68\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}     || 2.24\u00d710<sup>\u221226</sup> || 2/3 ||   83 ||  16 ||  0.43  ||   80\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|lithium|6}}        || 1.46\u00d710<sup>\u221227</sup> || 1/2 || 1700 ||     || 0.005 || 6800\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|boron|11}}        || 3.01\u00d710<sup>\u221227</sup> || 1/3 || 1240 || 500 || 0.014 || 2500\n|}\n\nThe maximum value of <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> is taken from a previous table.

It indicates the factor by which the other reactions occur more slowly than the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction under comparable conditions. The column \"[[Lawson criterion]]\" weights these results with ''E''<sub>ch</sub> and gives an indication of how much more difficult it is to achieve ignition with these reactions, relative to the difficulty for the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction. The next-to-last column is labeled \"power density\" and weights the practical reactivity by ''E''<sub>fus</sub>. The final column indicates how much lower the fusion power density of the other reactions is compared to the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction and can be considered a measure of the economic potential.\n\n===Bremsstrahlung losses in quasineutral, isotropic plasmas===\nThe ions undergoing fusion in many systems will essentially never occur alone but will be mixed with [[electron]]s that in aggregate neutralize the ions' bulk [[electrical charge]] and form a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The electrons will generally have a temperature comparable to or greater than that of the ions, so they will collide with the ions and emit [[x-ray]] radiation of 10\u201330 keV energy, a process known as [[Bremsstrahlung]].\n\nThe huge size of the Sun and stars means that the x-rays produced in this process will not escape and will deposit their energy back into the plasma. They are said to be [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] to x-rays. But any terrestrial fusion reactor will be [[Optical depth|optically thin]] for x-rays of this energy range. X-rays are difficult to reflect but they are effectively absorbed (and converted into heat) in less than mm thickness of stainless steel (which is part of a reactor's shield). This means the bremsstrahlung process is carrying energy out of the plasma, cooling it.\n \nThe ratio of fusion power produced to x-ray radiation lost to walls is an important figure of merit. This ratio is generally maximized at a much higher temperature than that which maximizes the power density (see the previous subsection). The following table shows estimates of the optimum temperature and the power ratio at that temperature for several reactions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                    !!''T''<sub>i</sub> (keV)!!''P''<sub>fusion</sub>/''P''<sub>Bremsstrahlung</sub>\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|tritium}}   ||   50 || 140\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} ||  500 ||   2.9\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}    ||  100 ||   5.3\n|-\n|{{nuclide|helium|3}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}       || 1000 ||   0.72\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|lithium|6}}      ||  800 ||   0.21\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|boron|11}}       ||  300 ||   0.57\n|}\n\nThe actual ratios of fusion to Bremsstrahlung power will likely be significantly lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that the energy of the fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves ''must'' remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and ''will'' remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.\n\nThe temperatures maximizing the fusion power compared to the Bremsstrahlung are in every case higher than the temperature that maximizes the power density and minimizes the required value of the [[Lawson criterion|fusion triple product]]. This will not change the optimum operating point for {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} very much because the Bremsstrahlung fraction is low, but it will push the other fuels into regimes where the power density relative to {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} is even lower and the required confinement even more difficult to achieve. For {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} and {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, Bremsstrahlung losses will be a serious, possibly prohibitive problem. For {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|6}} and [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|boron|11}} the Bremsstrahlung losses appear to make a fusion reactor using these fuels with a quasineutral, isotropic plasma impossible. Some ways out of this dilemma are considered\u2014and rejected\u2014in ''fundamental limitations on plasma fusion systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fundamental Limitations on Plasma Fusion Systems not in Thermodynamic Equilibrium|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International|volume= 56-07 |issue=Section B|page= 3820|author=Rider, Todd Harrison|bibcode=1995PhDT........45R|year=1995}}</ref><ref>Rostoker, Norman; Binderbauer, Michl and Qerushi,\nArtan.

Estimating the radius of an atomic nuclei as about one femtometer, the energy needed for fusion of two hydrogen is:\n\n<math>E_{\\text{thresh}}= \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z_1 Z_2}{r} \\xrightarrow{\\text{2 protons}} \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{1 \\text{ fm}} \\approx 1.4 \\text{ MeV}</math>\n\nThis would imply that for the core of the sun, which has a [[Boltzmann distribution]] with a temperature of around 1.4 keV, the probability hydrogen would reach the threshold is <math>10^{-290}</math>, that is, fusion would never occur. However, fusion in the sun does occur due to quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Parameterization of cross section ===\nThe probability that fusion occurs is greatly increased compared to the classical picture, thanks to the smearing of the effective radius as the [[Matter wave|DeBroglie wavelength]] as well as [[quantum tunnelling]] through the potential barrier. To determine the rate of fusion reactions, the value of most interest is the [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]], which describes the probability that particle will fuse by giving a characteristic area of interaction.  An estimation of the fusion cross sectional area is often broken into three pieces:\n\n:<math>\\sigma \\approx \\sigma_{geometry} \\times T \\times R</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\sigma_{geometry} </math> is the geometric cross section, {{mvar|T}} is the barrier transparency and {{mvar|R}} is the reaction characteristics of the reaction. \n\n<math>\\sigma_{geometry} </math> is of the order of the square of the de-Broglie wavelength <math>\\sigma_{geometry} \\approx \\lambda^2 = \\bigg( \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_r v} \\bigg)^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} </math> where <math>m_r </math> is the reduced mass of the system and <math>\\epsilon  </math> is the center of mass energy of the system. \n\n{{mvar|T}} can be approximated by the Gamow transparency, which has the form: <math>T \\approx e^ {- \\sqrt{\\epsilon_G /\\epsilon} } </math> where <math>\\epsilon_G = ( \\pi \\alpha Z_1 Z_2)^2 \\times 2 m_r c^2 </math> is the [[Gamow factor]] and comes from estimating the quantum tunneling probability through the potential barrier. \n\n{{mvar|R}} contains all the nuclear physics of the specific reaction and takes very different values depending on the nature of the interaction. However, for most reactions, the variation of <math>R(\\epsilon)</math> is small compared to the variation from the Gamow factor and so is approximated by a function called the [[S-factor|Astrophysical S-factor]], <math>S(\\epsilon)</math>, which is weakly varying in energy. Putting these dependencies together, one approximation for the fusion cross section as a function of energy takes the form:\n\n:<math>\\sigma(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{S(\\epsilon)}{\\epsilon} e^{ -  \\epsilon_G / \\sqrt{\\epsilon}}</math>\n\nMore detailed forms of the cross section can be derived through nuclear physics based models and [[R-matrix]] theory.\n\n=== Formulas of fusion cross sections ===\nThe Naval Research Lab's plasma physics formulary<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/online_pubs/NRL_FORMULARY_13.pdf|title=NRL PLASMA FORMULARY|last=Huba|first=J.|date=2003|website=MIT Catalog|access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref> gives the total cross section in [[Barn_(unit)|barns]] as a function of the energy (in keV) of the incident particle towards a target ion at rest fit by the formula:\n\n<math>\\sigma^{NRL}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{A_5 + \\big( (A_4 - A_3 \\epsilon)^2 + 1) \\big)^{-1} A_2}{ \\epsilon (e^{A_1 \\epsilon^{-1/2} }-1)}</math> with the following coefficient values:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+NRL Formulary Cross Section Coefficients\n!\n!DT(1)\n!DD(2i)\n!DD(2ii)\n!DHe<sup>3</sup>(3)\n!TT(4)\n!THe<sup>3</sup>(6)\n|-\n|A1\n|45.95\n|46.097\n|47.88\n|89.27\n|38.39\n|123.1\n|-\n|A2\n|50200\n|372\n|482\n|25900\n|448\n|11250\n|-\n|A3\n|1.368e-2\n|4.36e-4\n|3.08e-4\n|3.98e-3\n|1.02e-3\n|0\n|-\n|A4\n|1.076\n|1.22\n|1.177\n|1.297\n|2.09\n|0\n|-\n|A5\n|409\n|0\n|0\n|647\n|0\n|0\n|}\nBosch-Hale<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Improved formulas for fusion cross-sections and thermal reactivities|journal=Nuclear Fusion|volume=32|issue=4|pages=611\u2013631|last=Bosch|first=H.
