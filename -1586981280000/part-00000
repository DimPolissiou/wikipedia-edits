Peirce]], she was alive when Osman was enthroned as sultan in 1618 after the deposition of incompetent [[Mustafa I]]; Peirce believes that she was not living in the palace during his son's reign nor did she act as ''[[valide sultan]]'', as privy purse registers listed no ''valide sultan'' during Osman's reign.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} Also from the middle of 1620, Osman's governess, the ''daye hatun'', began to receive an extraordinary large stipend, one thousand aspers a day rather than her usual two hundred aspers, an indication that she was now the official stand-in for the Valide Sultan.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} Mahfiruz may have fallen out of favour, judging by her absence in the palace and burial in Ey\u00fcb rather than with her husband, and never have recovered her status as a royal consort.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} Venetian ambassador Contarini reported the beating of a woman who had irritated [[K\u00f6sem Sultan|K\u00f6sem]], ordered by the sultan, in 1612, which may be identified to Mahfiruz.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} She may have been a rival of K\u00f6sem, who made efforts to keep [[Mustafa I|Mustafa]] safe from execution, and saw an obstacle in Mahfiruz.{{why|date=February 2016}}{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} She was buried in the large sanctuary of [[Ey\u00fcp]], [[Istanbul]].{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}}\n\n<gallery>\nLevni.

They compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]]. The team plays its home games at the [[American Airlines Center]], which it shares with the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Dallas Stars]].\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the Mavericks were a perennial playoff team, led by [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Stars]] [[Rolando Blackman]] and [[Mark Aguirre]]. The team struggled during the 1990s, entering into a period of rebuilding. In 1998, the franchise's fortunes would change drastically with the acquisition of [[Dirk Nowitzki]], who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history, leading the team to its first NBA championship in [[2011 NBA Finals|2011]].\n\nAs of the 2017 season, the Mavericks have sold out 707 consecutive games since December 15, 2002, the longest currently running sellout streak in North American major league sports.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.star-telegram.com/sports/nba/dallas-mavericks/article118601658.html|title=Poor start to season could put Dallas Mavericks\u2019 sellout streak in jeopardy|newspaper=Star-Telegram|accessdate=August 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince their [[1980\u201381 Dallas Mavericks season|inaugural 1980\u201381 season]], the Mavericks have won three division titles ([[1986\u201387 NBA season|1987]], [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2007]], [[2009\u201310 NBA season|2010]]), two conference championships ([[2006 NBA Finals|2006]], [[2011 NBA Finals|2011]]), and one [[NBA championship]] ([[2011 NBA Finals|2011]]).\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{Main|History of the Dallas Mavericks}}\n{{See also|List of Dallas Mavericks seasons}}\n\n===1978\u20131981: Birth of the Mavericks===\nIn 1978, Californian businessman Garn Eckardt met [[Dallas]] lawyer Doug Adkins, and mentioned he was trying to raise capital to move an NBA team to the city. Asking for a possible partner, Adkins recommended him one of his clients, [[Home Interiors and Gifts]] owner [[Don Carter (businessman)|Don Carter]]. Negotiations with Eckardt fell through, but Carter remained interested in the enterprise as a gift to his wife Linda, who played basketball while at [[Duncanville High School]]. At the same time, [[Buffalo Braves]] president and general manager [[Norm Sonju]] developed an interest in bringing the NBA to Dallas as he studied possible new locations for the ailing franchise. While the Braves went to California as the [[San Diego Clippers]], Sonju eventually returned to Texas, and was introduced to Carter by mayor [[Robert Folsom]], one of the owners and team president of the last professional basketball team in the city, the Dallas Chaparrals of the [[American Basketball Association]], which moved to [[San Antonio]] in 1973 to become the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. Sonju and Carter tried purchasing both the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] and the [[Kansas City Kings]], but disagreement on relocation stalled the negotiations, leading them to instead aim for an [[expansion team]].\n\nThe league was initially reluctant to expand to Dallas, given Texas had both the Spurs and [[Houston Rockets]], and the [[1978\u201379 NBA season]] was proving unprofitable (18 out of the 22 teams lost money) and unpopular (television ratings fell 26 percent). Still, during the [[1979 NBA All-Star Game]] weekend, [[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA commissioner]] [[Larry O'Brien]] announced the league would add two new teams in the [[1980\u201381 NBA season|1980\u201381 season]], with teams in Dallas and [[Minneapolis]]. Once the Minnesota team backed out (it would not be until 1989 that Minneapolis would get another NBA team when the [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Timberwolves]] started play), only Dallas remained, and through negotiations with general counselor and future commissioner [[David Stern]], the expansion fee was settled on the $12.5&nbsp;million.

Vandeweghe was traded to the [[Denver Nuggets]], along with a first-round pick, in 1981, in exchange for two future first-round picks that eventually materialized into [[Rolando Blackman]] in [[1981 NBA draft|1981]] and [[Sam Perkins]] in [[1984 NBA draft|1984]].\n\n[[File:Don Carter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mavs' founder [[Don Carter (businessman)|Don Carter]]]]\nIn the Mavericks' debut game, taking place in the brand-new [[Reunion Arena]], the Mavericks defeated the Spurs, 103\u201392. But the Mavs started the season with a 6\u201340 record on their way to finishing 15\u201367. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to play a very important role in the early years of their franchise. Journeyman 6&nbsp;ft 3 in guard [[Brad Davis (basketball)|Brad Davis]], who played for the [[Anchorage Northern Knights]] of the [[Continental Basketball Association]], was tracked down and signed by the Mavs in December. At the time, there was absolutely no reason to expect that Davis would be any better than the expansion-level talent the Mavs had.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} But he started the Mavs' final 26 games, led the team in assists, and his career soared. He spent the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually his number 15 jersey was retired. The Mavericks also marked the first NBA team to have a profitable debut season, with an average of 7,789 spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-10/sports/sp-2289_1_texas-football/2|title=In Texas, Winning Is the Name of the Game|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1981 NBA Draft brought three players who would become vital parts of the team. The Mavs selected 6'6\" forward [[Mark Aguirre]] with the first pick, 6'6\" guard [[Rolando Blackman]] 9th, and 6'7\" forward [[Jay Vincent]] 24th. By the end of his seven-year Mavs career, Aguirre would average 24.6 points per game. Blackman contributed 19.2 points over his 11-year career in Dallas. But it was Jay Vincent who made the biggest difference for the Mavs in their second season, leading the team in scoring with 21.4 points per game and earning NBA All-Rookie Team honors. The Mavericks improved to 28\u201354, getting out of the Midwest Division cellar as they finished above the [[Utah Jazz]].\n\n===1982\u20131990: Playoff contention===\nIn [[1982\u201383 NBA season|1982\u201383]], the Mavericks were serious contenders for the first time.  At the [[1983 NBA All-Star Game|All-Star break]], they were 25\u201324 and had won 12 of their last 15 games.  They could not sustain that momentum and finished seven games behind the Denver Nuggets for the sixth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. But the Mavs' 38\u201344 record was a 10-game improvement from the previous season.\n\nMark Aguirre led the 1982\u201383 Mavericks with 24.4 points per game, finishing sixth in the NBA. [[Jay Vincent]] and [[Rolando Blackman]] contributed 18.7 and 17.7 points per game, respectively. Brad Davis was 10th in the NBA in assists with 7.2 per game, and shot .845 from the free-throw line, 6th in the league. [[Derek Harper]] was drafted by the Mavs with the 11th pick of the [[1983 NBA draft]]. The 6&nbsp;ft 4 in guard would spend the next decade with the organization, averaging 15 points and 6.1 assists. The Mavericks' in [[1983\u201384 NBA season|1983\u201384]] posted a winning record for the first time in franchise history, finishing 43\u201339 and second in the Midwest Division. The Mavs also earned the first playoff berth in franchise history. Mark Aguirre was named the team's first NBA All-Star, as he finished with an average of 29.5 points per game\u2014second in the league to Utah's [[Adrian Dantley]].\n\nDallas finished with the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, and in their first playoff trip, they defeated the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in five games. The fifth and deciding game of that series was played at [[Moody Coliseum]], as Reunion Arena, then the home court for the Mavericks, was hosting a tennis tournament. The [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[1983\u201384 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] were next for the Mavs, and the young club fell short, losing four games to one. But a trade the Mavericks made in their inaugural season of 1980 paid off for them in 1984, because they owned [[Cleveland Cavaliers|Cleveland]]'s first-round pick, which ended up being the fourth pick overall. The Mavs used it to select forward-center [[Sam Perkins]], a former [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heel]] with a surprising range from the three-point line who would average 14.4 points and 8.0 rebounds in six seasons with Dallas.\n\nAbout this time, the [[Dallas Cowboys]], once one of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s elite teams, began a slow decline that eventually saw them fall to 1\u201315 in [[1989 Dallas Cowboys season|1989]]. The Mavs were hitting their stride at about the same time and replaced the Cowboys as the Metroplex' team. The [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1984\u201385]] team finished a game better than the previous year at 44\u201338. Mark Aguirre led the team in scoring again with 25.7 ppg, [[Sam Perkins]] made the All-Rookie team, and Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the [[1985 NBA All-Star Game]]. The Mavs returned to the [[1985 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1985]], but were not as successful as they had been the previous year. They won Game 1 in double-overtime against the [[1984\u201385 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in their first-round playoff series, but lost the next three games in a row, ending their season.\n\nDallas had the eighth pick in the [[1985 NBA draft]]\u2014again due to a trade with the Cavaliers\u2014and drafted German-born forward [[Detlef Schrempf]] out of [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]]. He would show flashes of brilliance in his three-plus seasons with the team, but it was not until he was traded to the [[Indiana Pacers]] that he displayed his full potential. The Mavericks also traded center [[Kurt Nimphius]] to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] for center [[James Donaldson (basketball)|James Donaldson]], who would play for the Mavericks until halfway through the [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392 season]]. This allowed the Mavericks to have the steady hand at the center that had been lacking throughout the franchise's first five years. In 1988, James Donaldson was the only All-Star center in Dallas Maverick history.\n\n[[Rolando Blackman]] represented the Mavericks in the [[1986 NBA All-Star Game]], hosted by Dallas at Reunion Arena. The 1985\u201386 Mavericks were second in scoring at 115.3 points per game, gaining them their third-straight playoff appearance. They defeated [[1985\u201386 Utah Jazz season|Utah]] three games to one in the first round. In the conference semi-finals, they ran into the [[1985\u201386 Los Angeles Lakers season|Lakers]] again, and L.A. defeated Dallas in six games. But four of those games were decided by four points or less, and Dallas won half of those, leaving Mavericks fans room to hope that they could finally top the Lakers in the following season. The Mavs drafted [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]] center [[Roy Tarpley]] with the seventh overall pick, who would go on to become a very talented\u2014but troubled\u2014member of the roster.\n\nThe [[1986\u201387 NBA season|1986\u201387]] Mavericks team had their most successful regular-season to date, going 55\u201327 and winning their first Midwest Division title. But despite the great expectations surrounding the team, they self-destructed in the playoffs. After hammering the [[1986\u201387 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle SuperSonics]] by 22 points in Game 1, the bottom dropped out for the Mavs, as they lost Games 2 and 3 in close fashion before succumbing in Game 4 in [[Seattle]]. Following the unexpected early playoff exit, Motta, who had been with the team since its inception, shockingly resigned as head coach. [[John MacLeod (basketball)|John MacLeod]], who had led the [[Phoenix Suns]] to nine playoff berths in 11 seasons including an NBA Finals run in 1976, was hired as his replacement.\n\nThe [[1987\u201388 NBA season]] saw the Mavericks dip just a little bit in the regular season\u2014finishing 53\u201329 and losing their Midwest Division title to the [[Denver Nuggets]]\u2014but it was another successful year for the team. [[Mark Aguirre]] and [[James Donaldson (basketball)|James Donaldson]] both played in the [[1988 NBA All-Star Game]], the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and [[Rolando Blackman]] scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and [[Roy Tarpley]] won the [[NBA Sixth Man Award]] with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the [[Houston Rockets]] in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion [[1987\u201388 Los Angeles Lakers season|Lakers]] between them and their first-ever trip to the [[1988 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle, but in the end, the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship.\n\nDespite all the changes, the Mavs remained in contention. However, their season effectively ended when James Donaldson went down with a ruptured [[patella]] tendon on March 10, 1989, and missed the rest of the season as a result. The Mavericks were left undermanned, demoralized and disheartened as they finished with a 38\u201344 record. It was their first losing season since 1982\u201383\u2014which was also the last time they missed the playoffs.\n[[File:Lipofsky Mark Aguirre.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Mark Aguirre was traded to the Detroit Pistons in 1989.]]\nThe Mavericks returned to the [[1990 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]] with a 47\u201335 record, but it was another season of off-court chaos. On November 15, only six games into the Mavs' season, Tarpley was arrested for [[driving while intoxicated]] and resisting arrest. The team started 5\u20136 and MacLeod was fired, replaced by assistant coach [[Richie Adubato]]. The Mavs finished the season with four straight victories to surge into the playoffs but went down rather meekly to the [[1989\u201390 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in three games. It would be the team's last winning season and playoff appearance until 2001.\n\n===1990\u20131998: Rebuilding===\n====1990\u20131994====\nThe team endured numerous changes in 1990, losing Sam Perkins to the Lakers via free agency and suffering injuries to practically their entire [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391]] starting lineup. The players they managed to acquire\u2014[[Rodney McCray (basketball)|Rodney McCray]], [[Fat Lever]] and [[Alex English]]\u2014were all in the twilight of their careers. On November 9 it was announced that Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own which ended his season. The Mavericks' season only got worse from there, and they finished with a record of 28\u201354, falling behind even the second-year [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] and [[Orlando Magic]]. In March 1991, Tarpley was charged with suspicion of [[driving while intoxicated]] and was suspended again by the NBA.\n \t\t\nIt got even worse in [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392]]. Before the season even began, Tarpley violated the league's substance abuse policy for the third time and was banned from the NBA for life. The former Sixth Man Award winner's fall from grace was complete. The few talented players the Mavericks had remaining to them were lost to injury. Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season\u2014hardly worth the cost of losing two first-round draft picks. The team finished with a 22\u201360 record.\n\nIn [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]], the rebuilding began in earnest, with the Mavs trading [[Rolando Blackman]]\u2014who by that point had surpassed Mark Aguirre as the team's all-time leading scorer\u2014to the [[New York Knicks]] for a first-round draft pick. Blackman had made four All-Star Game appearances in his Mavericks career. [[Herb Williams]] joined the Knicks as a free agent. Fat Lever underwent more surgery and missed the entire 1992\u201393 season. Derek Harper was the team's sole bright spot, leading the team with 18.3 points per game.\n\nThe Mavericks selected [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] guard [[Jim Jackson (basketball)|Jim Jackson]] with the fourth overall pick of the [[1992 NBA draft]], but he and owner Donald Carter could not come to terms on a contract for half of his rookie season. Jackson only played 28 games in [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]], a season that was also ruined by trades, a coaching change and injuries. The Mavericks started 2\u201327 and fired Adubato on January 13, replacing him with [[Gar Heard]]. The Mavericks came dangerously close to setting the all-time worst record in NBA history (at the time, 9\u201373 by the [[1972\u201373 NBA season|1972\u201373]] [[1972\u201373 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]]). But when Jackson was signed on March 3, the Mavs rallied, closing the season with a 7\u201314 mark, including two straight wins to end the season and finish 11\u201371, which was the second-worst record in NBA history.\n \t\t\nDallas selected [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] forward [[Jamal Mashburn]] with the fourth overall pick of the [[1993 NBA draft]] and hired [[Quinn Buckner]] as coach.  Part of the problem was that Buckner decided from the start to be a disciplinarian on the model of his college coach, [[Bobby Knight]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} The mostly young roster did not respond very well to Buckner's stern coaching style and started 1\u201323. By the end of January, they were 3\u201340, and it was once again possible that they could tie the 1973 Sixers for the all-time worst record in the league. But 5\u20139 records in February and April, coupled with Buckner loosening the reins a little bit, helped the Mavs finish 13\u201369. It was still by far the worst record in the league, but the Mavericks again avoided setting an all-time futility record. They did, however, tie the NBA's ''single-season'' record for consecutive losses at [[List of National Basketball Association longest losing streaks|20 games]] (since broken).\n \t\t\nBuckner was fired after garnering the worst full-season record for a rookie head coach\u2014a record that only lasted four years, until [[Bill Hanzlik]] broke it with the [[Denver Nuggets]]. The Mavericks brought back Dick Motta, who had led the franchise to some of its most successful seasons. The Mavericks also wound up with the number two pick in the [[1994 NBA draft]], and picked up [[California Golden Bears men's basketball|Cal]] point guard [[Jason Kidd]], giving them a solid tandem of Jackson, Mashburn and Kidd which would become known as \"The Three Js\".\n\n====1994\u20131996: Arrival of Jason Kidd====\nThe addition of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with new life in [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395]]. Kidd averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists in his rookie season, and led the league in triple-doubles. [[Roy Tarpley]] was allowed to return to the league after three years and helped with 12.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. The tandem of Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn combined as the league's highest-scoring pair of teammates. On separate occasions, Mashburn and Jackson scored 50 points in a game that season. Mashburn contributed 24.1 points per game, fifth in the NBA; Jackson averaged 25.7 points but suffered a severe ankle sprain in February which caused him to miss the remainder of the regular season. Second-year forward [[Popeye Jones]] had a great year as well, as he averaged 10.6 rebounds and led the NBA in offensive rebounds.\n \t\t\nThe Mavericks' improvement was dramatic. They jumped to 36\u201346, 10th in the Western Conference and only five games behind the [[1994\u201395 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] for the eighth and final playoff spot. It was the biggest one-year improvement in the team's history and the highest in the NBA that season. Many{{Who|date=December 2014}} expected the Mavericks' improvement to continue with the franchise's first foray into the NBA Playoffs since 1990. But despite a 4\u20130 start, the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]] was a disappointment in about every conceivable way.{{According to whom|date=December 2014}} For the second time in his career, Roy Tarpley was given a lifelong ban from the NBA for repeated violations of the anti-drug policy\u2014he never played in the NBA again. Jamal Mashburn had season-ending surgery to repair his sore right knee only 18 games into the Mavericks' schedule.\n \t\t\nThe team's two remaining stars, Jason Kidd and Jim Jackson, bickered throughout the season, though neither of them had any trouble establishing his individual stardom. Jackson led the team in scoring with 19.6 ppg, made 121 three-pointers and was the only Mav to start in all 82 games. Kidd became the first Maverick to be elected a starter in the NBA All-Star Game and finished second in the league in assists and fourth in steals while averaging 16.6 ppg. [[George McCloud]], who averaged 9.6 ppg in his previous year, blew away his career-high scoring average as the Mavs resorted to the outside shot time and again due to their lack of an inside scoring threat. McCloud averaged 18.9 ppg and made 257 three-pointers, equaling the second-highest individual season total in league history.\n\nOverall, the Mavericks connected on 735 of their 2,039 three-point attempts, both new league records. The Mavs finished 26\u201356, fifth in the Midwest Division and 33 games out of first place. At season's end, Motta was relieved of his head coaching responsibilities and replaced by former Bulls assistant coach [[Jim Cleamons]]. And Don Carter, the only owner the Mavericks had ever had, sold the team to a group of investors led by [[H. Ross Perot, Jr.]]\n\n====1996\u20131998====\nThe [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]] was a year of transition for the Mavericks, as they basically re-designed their entire team; 27 different players saw action for that Dallas team, setting an all-time NBA record. By the time the season was over, only rookie forward [[Samaki Walker]] remained from the opening-day roster. The first big move came in December, as Jason Kidd, [[Loren Meyer]] and [[Tony Dumas]] were traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for guards [[Michael Finley]] and [[Sam Cassell]] and forward [[A. C. Green]]. By far the most important of these acquisitions{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} was Finley who, after his first half-season in Dallas, went on to average over or near 20 ppg for at least the next seven years of his Mavericks career. He made two visits to the NBA All-Star Game and played in each of the Mavs' games until the 2004\u201305 season.\n \t\t\n[[Don Nelson]] was hired as Dallas' general manager on February 7. Within a week of his hiring, the Mavs had released [[Fred Roberts]] and [[Oliver Miller]] and traded Jamal Mashburn to the [[Miami Heat]] for forwards [[Kurt Thomas (basketball)|Kurt Thomas]] and [[Martin M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp]] and guard [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107|Sasha Danilovi\u0107]]. Thomas did not play in 1996\u201397, and only ended up playing in five games as a Maverick before signing as a free agent with the [[New York Knicks]]. Danilovi\u0107 played in 13 games for the Mavs before opting out of his contract and signing with Bucker Bologna of the Italian League, and M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp played in 73 games for the Mavericks over the next two years before leaving the NBA.\n \t\t\n[[Chris Gatling]] was the Mavericks' sole representative in the NBA All-Star Game, but he did not last much longer in Dallas. In one of the largest two-team trades in NBA history, the Mavericks traded Gatling, Jim Jackson, Sam Cassell, George McCloud and [[Eric Montross]] to the [[New Jersey Nets]] for 7&nbsp;ft 6 in center [[Shawn Bradley]], forward [[Ed O'Bannon]] and guards [[Khalid Reeves]] and [[Robert Pack (basketball)|Robert Pack]]. Nelson claimed the trades were necessary because the situation in the locker room was unacceptable. However, whereas Cassell went on to become a consistent floor leader and Jackson, Gatling and McCloud all continued to be solid contributors to their teams for several more years, only Bradley lasted any sort of time in Dallas and would spend part of the next eight years putting up modest contributions for the Mavs and giving them solid numbers in terms of blocked shots.\n\nUndrafted rookie guard [[Erick Strickland]] averaged 10.6 ppg. He, along with Finley and Bradley, was expected to be the core of this new Mavericks team. The constant changes made it impossible to establish any sort of team chemistry in 1996\u201397, and the Mavericks finished 24\u201358. But they had acquired some of the pieces that would help them start to turn things around in years to come. In 1997\u201398, despite a poor record of 20\u201362, Dallas had a knack for giving some of the NBA's elite teams a hard time, as they beat the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], [[New York Knicks]], [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[Chicago Bulls]]. Against the Bulls, Dallas went on a 17\u20132 run to force overtime, where they won 104\u201397.  Midway through that season, Nelson fired Cleamons and named himself head coach.\n\n===1998\u20132019: The Dirk Nowitzki era===\n====1998\u20132001: New beginnings====\n[[File:Dirk Nowitzki 2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Dirk Nowitzki was acquired by the Mavericks from the Milwaukee Bucks in 1998 and would become the face of the franchise in later years.]]\nIn the [[1998\u201399 NBA lockout|lockout-shortened]] [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399]] season, the Mavericks finished with a lowly 19\u201331 record, but Michael Finley and [[Gary Trent]] put up solid numbers and led their team to their first winning home record (15\u201310) since 1989\u201390. Notable were the acquisitions of power forward [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and point guard [[Steve Nash]], two seemingly unspectacular moves which would make a great impact in the future. In the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|following season]] the [[1999\u20132000 Dallas Mavericks season|team]] finally \"clicked\" and started to win on a consistent basis. Led by Finley, the Mavericks earned their first 40-win season since 1989\u201390. He was greatly helped by Nowitzki, who finally \"arrived\" in the NBA and established himself as a potent offensive threat.\n\nOn January 14, 2000, Ross Perot's group sold the Dallas Mavericks to Internet entrepreneur and season ticket-holder [[Mark Cuban]] for $285&nbsp;million. Cuban immediately set out to revitalize the Mavericks and increase the team's popularity in Dallas and nationwide. His controversial moves (he allowed [[Dennis Rodman]] to live in his house for a week before temporarily signing him) and outspoken personality quickly made him a fan favorite in Dallas and garnered the team lots of press in the national media. He has also been fined millions of dollars for violating NBA rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/dallas/nba/story/_/id/10315836/mark-cuban-wish-granted-one-last-fine-david-stern-retires|title=Mark Cuban's wish granted with one last fine before David Stern retires|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n \t\t\nIn [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]], the Mavericks improved further and finished with a 53\u201329 record, fueled by an offensive triangle of Nowitzki, Finley and Nash. The Mavs made a trade minutes before the trade deadline that sent [[Hubert Davis]], [[Christian Laettner]], [[Courtney Alexander]], [[Loy Vaught]], and [[Etan Thomas]] to the [[Washington Wizards]] for [[Juwan Howard]], [[Calvin Booth]] and [[Obinna Ekezie]]. This move brought in fresh blood that secured the club's first playoff visit in 11 years. Also, [[Wang Zhizhi]] became the first Chinese player to play in the NBA, signing with the Mavs in January, along with the Eduardo N\u00e1jera, bringing Dallas an international cast that included Canada's Nash and Germany's Nowitzki. In the [[2001 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], the Mavericks won in the first round against the [[Utah Jazz]], advancing to the second round for the first time since 1988. Even though they were eliminated by the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in five games, it marked a sense of optimism for Dallas in seriously contending for an NBA title. This was also the last season in the old [[Reunion Arena]] before making the move to the modern [[American Airlines Center]].\n[[File:Victory Plaza 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Mavericks began playing at the [[American Airlines Center]] in 2001.]]\n\n====2001\u20132005: Run and Gun Nellie Ball====\nThe [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]] was a great season for the Mavericks, with a 57\u201325 record and many sellout crowds in the [[American Airlines Center]]. This season also saw a change in logo and colors, changing from the cowboy hat logo and green to a new horse logo. In addition, the team gained sleeker uniforms. Another blockbuster trade sent [[Juwan Howard]], [[Tim Hardaway]] and [[Donnell Harvey]] to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for [[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Nick Van Exel]], [[Tariq Abdul-Wahad]] and [[Avery Johnson]], the Mavericks also made several attempts to sign the [[Utah Jazz]]'s star [[Karl Malone]]. The Mavericks swept the [[Kevin Garnett]]-led [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] [[2002 NBA Playoffs|in the playoffs]] but lost again in the second round, this time to the [[Chris Webber]]-led [[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]].\n\nBut it was only in the next season that the Mavericks finally broke through. They started the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]] with a 14\u20130 record, which was one win shy of tying the NBA record set by the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394]] [[1993\u201394 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]] (15\u20130). The Mavericks finished with a 60\u201322 record in the regular season, astonishing fans and critics with their sparkling offense. Since acquiring the  \"Big Three\" of Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash, the Mavericks were a Western Conference power in waiting<ref>{{cite news|title=Worst to First|url=http://www.nba.com/features/mavericks_timeline_030408.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=April 9, 2003|accessdate=June 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618031126/http://www.nba.com/features/mavericks_timeline_030408.html|archive-date=June 18, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> and finally led the team to the Conference Finals against the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. However, with the series tied 1\u20131, Dirk Nowitzki, the team's leading scorer, suffered a knee injury in game three that kept him out the rest of the series. This further worsened the Mavs' front-court depth problems (both of their backup centers were injured for the entire series) and the Spurs took the series in 6 games.\n\nIn [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]], two blockbuster trades were announced. The Mavericks acquired [[Antawn Jamison]], [[Danny Fortson]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch]] and [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]] from [[Golden State Warriors|Golden State]] in exchange for Nick Van Exel, [[Evan Eschmeyer]], Popeye Jones, [[Avery Johnson]] and [[Antoine Rigaudeau]]. Another high-profile trade sent Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills and Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch to Boston for [[Antoine Walker]] and [[Tony Delk]]. Although the team struggled with chemistry, the Mavericks easily qualified for the playoffs. With the trio Nowitzki-Finley-Nash and [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year]] Jamison, the Mavericks continued their reputation as the best offensive team in the NBA. Notable were two rookies, [[Josh Howard]] and [[Marquis Daniels]], who made an immediate impact. However, the Mavericks were eliminated quickly [[2004 NBA Playoffs|in the playoffs]], losing in the first round to the [[Chris Webber]]-led [[Sacramento Kings]], a team which clearly played better defense. The Mavericks management had to re-evaluate their strategy.\n\nThe [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] saw trades which (among others) brought in burly center [[Erick Dampier]], combo guard [[Jason Terry]], speedy rookie point guard [[Devin Harris]], scoring machine [[Jerry Stackhouse]], and defensive stalwart [[Alan Henderson]]. Although the loss of All-Star Steve Nash via free agency visibly hurt the Mavericks' offense, the new acquisitions strengthened the team defense. The run-and-gun style of former times changed into a more balanced style of play. At the All-Star break, the Mavericks acquired [[Keith Van Horn]] for Calvin Booth and Henderson, the latter resigning only days later. Nowitzki added his third consecutive Euroscar during this season as well. On March 19, longtime coach Don Nelson resigned and his assistant Avery Johnson succeeded him. Under Johnson's tutelage, the defense of the Mavericks became stronger and they easily qualified for [[2005 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] with an impressive 58\u201324 record. The Mavericks defeated the [[Houston Rockets]] in Round 1 of the playoffs in 7 games but then lost to the [[Phoenix Suns]] 4\u20132, led by former Maverick star [[Steve Nash]].\n\n====2005\u20132006: First Finals appearance====\n{{Main|2005\u201306 Dallas Mavericks season}}\nPrior to the [[2005 NBA draft]], the Mavericks had traded all their picks away and were left empty-handed. On August 15, 2005, veteran guard Michael Finley was waived under the new \"Allan Houston Rule\".<ref>[http://www.dallasbasketball.com/morestories.asp?id=3286&NAV=1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920153034/http://www.dallasbasketball.com/morestories.asp?id=3286&NAV=1|date=September 20, 2014}}</ref> Under that rule, the [[Orlando Magic]] waived [[Doug Christie (basketball)|Doug Christie]], who then signed with the Mavericks. On August 19, the Mavericks held a press conference announcing they had re-signed [[Darrell Armstrong]], and introduced Christie, [[DeSagana Diop]], [[Rawle Marshall]], and [[Josh Powell]] as new Mavericks. Christie's playing time was very limited amid a surgically repaired ankle still hampering his play. He was waived on November 25, 2005. At the end of calendar 2005, Nowitzki achieved a rare double by winning both the Euroscar and [[Mr. Europa]], a second prestigious award for the top European player. He additionally was named the inaugural [[FIBA Europe Player of the Year Award|FIBA Europe Player of the Year]].\n\nUp until the very end of the season, the Mavericks were toe-to-toe with the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for the crown of the Southwest Division as well as the #1 spot in the Western Conference. However, they fell short of the title and had to settle for a fourth seed. Nonetheless, they once again achieved a 60\u201322 record, with [[Avery Johnson]] winning [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|NBA Coach of the Year]] honors. [[2006 NBA Playoffs|In the playoffs]], they swept the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], leading to a titanic series against their state rivals and the reigning NBA champions the San Antonio Spurs. Five out of the seven games were decided in the last minute, including a Game 7 that had to go into overtime, with the Mavs prevailing under the guidance of [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and an incredibly deep bench. The Mavericks were able to advance to the Conference Finals against former teammate [[Steve Nash]] and the [[Phoenix Suns]]. The Mavs' defense and depth enabled them to take the series, as they defeated the [[Phoenix Suns]] in game 6 of the Western Conference Finals on June 3, 2006, in the [[US Airways Center]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and the Mavs advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history.\n\n{{Main|2006 NBA Finals}}\nIn the NBA Finals, the Mavericks faced the [[2005\u201306 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], held home-court advantage and scored two convincing wins. After game 2, Dallas city officials had already planned the victory parade. However, in Game 3, the Mavs blew a late double-digit lead, courtesy of Heat guard [[Dwyane Wade]]. He carried the Heat to the win, with Nowitzki missing a potentially game-tying free throw in the last seconds. After getting blown out in Game 4, the Mavericks suffered another loss in Game 5 when Wade scored the game-tying basket in the last possession of regular time, putting the Heat ahead with last-second free throws in overtime. The [[tragic flaw|tragic figure]] was [[Josh Howard]], who missed a pair of clutch free throws in overtime and mistakenly called an early timeout, so the Mavs had to bring in the ball at backcourt rather than half-court for the last possession. In Game 6, the Mavericks took an early double-digit lead, but again, Wade poured in 36 points, helped by [[Alonzo Mourning]]'s five blocked shots, and the Mavericks lost their fourth game and the title after a string of botched three-pointers. Many Mavericks fans were stunned by the defeat. Mavericks owner [[Mark Cuban]] was fined a total of $250,000 for \"several acts of misconduct\" during the series, and Nowitzki was fined $5,000 for kicking a ball into the stands after Game 5.  Nowitzki was also caught by TV cameras attacking a stationary bicycle in the hallway outside of the Mavericks locker room. [[Jerry Stackhouse]] was suspended for Game 5 after fouling [[Shaquille O'Neal]] on a breakaway dunk attempt.  The latter marked the third time a Mavericks player was suspended in the 2006 playoffs.\n\nThe Mavericks became only the third team in NBA history (the first since 1977) to lose in the Finals after taking a 2\u20130 lead. In Game 3, the Mavs held a 13-point lead with under seven minutes remaining but were outscored 22\u20137 in the momentum-changing 98\u201396 defeat. The Heat's performance in the last seven minutes represented the team's greatest postseason comeback in team history.<ref>{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Brad|title=NBA.com: A Total Turnaround|url=http://www.nba.com/finals2006/heat_060620.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=June 20, 2006|accessdate=August 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017120059/http://www.nba.com/finals2006/heat_060620.html|archive-date=October 17, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====2006\u20132007: Nowitzki wins MVP====\nAfter an end to their playoff run in 2006, the Mavericks sought retribution in the new season. After a 0\u20134 start, the Mavericks went on a historic run and posted a 52\u20135 record over their next 57 games. They finished the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|regular season]] with a record of 67\u201315, good enough to be tied for 6th place all-time, first in the league and the number 1 seed in the [[2007 NBA Playoffs|Western Conference playoffs]]. [[Dirk Nowitzki]] had a dominant season, further cementing his place as one of the game's elite players; he won his fifth consecutive Euroscar during the season and was named the NBA MVP at its end. [[Josh Howard]] was named to the all-star team.\n\nHowever, the first-place Mavericks were defeated in six games by the 8th-seeded [[2006\u201307 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]]; this outcome was regarded by some as one of the biggest upsets in NBA history, while others did not consider it an upset at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/playoffs2007/news/billrussell_postseason.html#070501|title=NBA.com: NBA.com Blog: Bill Russell|accessdate=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/658m3e5kU?url=http://www.nba.com/playoffs2007/news/billrussell_postseason.html#070501|archive-date=February 2, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Mavs were exposed defensively, and the Warriors systematically dismantled the Mavericks by exploiting match-ups and preying on Dirk Nowitzki's weaknesses. On the year, the Mavericks went 67\u201312 against the rest of the league and 0\u20133 against Golden State. The Warriors were coached by [[Don Nelson]], the immediate past manager and coach of the Mavericks until he stepped down at the end of the 2005\u201306 season, and he had been appointed head coach of the Warriors in the 2006\u201307 mid-season.\n\nNowitzki's winning of regular season MVP honors and his team's first-round exit created an awkward dilemma regarding the MVP trophy ceremony.  Traditionally, the MVP award is given to the winner in a ceremony between the first and second rounds of the playoffs.  But it has been believed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2866994|title=Mavs' Nowitzki will receive MVP trophy next week|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> that the league opted to put some distance between the MVP presentation and the Mavericks' elimination against the Warriors. By the time Nowitzki collected his MVP award, nearly two weeks had elapsed since the Mavs were ousted in the playoffs.\n\n====2007\u20132008: The return of Jason Kidd====\n{{Main|2007\u201308 Dallas Mavericks season}}\n[[File: Jason Kidd drives Feb 24 2008.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Kidd drives to the basket during a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.]]\nThe Mavericks dealt [[Devin Harris]], two first-round picks and others to the [[New Jersey Nets]] for veteran all-star [[Jason Kidd]] and other role players, Cuban also tried to sign the free agent [[Kevin Garnett]] unsuccessfully. The Mavericks were 3\u201311 against winning teams since the trade and lost Nowitzki for a little over a week due to a high ankle sprain injury. He returned April 2 in a crucial game against the [[2008\u201309 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] in a 111\u201386 Mavericks victory and helped defeat the [[2008\u201309 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in a 105\u201398 win on April 6. This win in Phoenix was especially significant because the Mavs had been nearly unable to defeat a contending team on the road the entire season. Continuing their playoff push, Dirk hit a crucial three-pointer with 0.9 seconds left, defeating the [[2008\u201309 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]] 97\u201394 on April 10. This victory guaranteed them a playoff spot and their 8th consecutive 50-win season. The Mavericks ended the season with a record of 51\u201331. In the first round of the playoffs, the Mavericks were eliminated once again, by the New Orleans Hornets 4\u20131 on the road, 99\u201394.\n\nJust one day after a disappointing season ended, Avery Johnson was dismissed as Head Coach of the Dallas Mavericks.

But a run of 5\u20131 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. [[Dirk Nowitzki]] also entered the postseason with a streak of twenty-five consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in the first game of the quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, [[2008\u201309 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nThe Mavericks surprised many people by winning Game 1, 105\u201397 in San Antonio.<ref>The Examiner, April 19, 2009, Home teams lose 3 of 4 in Playoff openers, www.examiner.com/article/home-teams-lose-3-of-4-playoff-openers</ref> The Spurs quickly won game two in a rout. As the series shifted to Dallas, who had only lost one game there after the All-Star Break, won both Games 3 and 4. San Antonio was just trying to win Game 5 to extend the series, but they could not do it as the Mavericks closed out the series with a 13-point-victory, 106\u201393. With the Victory, the Mavericks advanced to the Conference semi-finals for the first time since 2006.\n\nIn the semi-finals, they faced the two-seeded [[2008\u201309 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]], who were fresh off a 4\u20131 series win against the [[2008\u201309 New Orleans Hornets season|New Orleans Hornets]], including a 58-point win in New Orleans. The Mavericks stayed close with the Nuggets in the first three-quarters of Games 1 and 2, but it was the fourth quarter when [[Carmelo Anthony]] and the Nuggets woke up, as they took the first two games by double-digit figures. Game 3 in Dallas was close the whole way, and Dallas led by five points with less than a minute to go. But Carmelo Anthony hit a three-pointer to give the Nuggets a 106\u2013105 victory. The play generated quite a bit of controversy because Maverick guard Antoine Wright clearly fouled Anthony, but since there was no replay used in the NBA in 2009 the Mavericks suffered a game 3 loss. It was later announced by the league that the referees made the wrong call,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2009/news/story?id=4155285|title=NBA admits referees' error cost the Dallas Mavericks in the final seconds|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> but despite that, the Mavericks still faced a 3\u20130 deficit in the series.\n\nNowitzki's 44 points in Game 4 saved the Mavericks season, sending the series back to Denver for a Game 5, with the series in Denver's favor, 3\u20131. Game 5 would prove to be the final game for the Mavericks of the 2009 season, as they would be ousted by a score of 124\u2013110. The elimination led to an off-season facing many questions about the future construction of the team.\n\nAfter a disappointing loss to the Nuggets in the playoffs, the Mavericks entered the off-season with many questions about the future construction of the team. They began by re-signing [[Jason Kidd]] to a three-year contract extension, which took care of their pending point guard issue. The Mavericks also made a move to compound their age problem, by trading for former All-Star small forward [[Shawn Marion]]. In a three-team deal with the Grizzlies and Raptors, the Mavericks sent swing-man Antoine Wright along with defensive stalwart Devean George to Toronto, while aging guard Jerry Stackhouse landed in Memphis. Dallas also acquired burly center [[Nathan Jawai]] and power forward [[Kris Humphries]]. Many analysts viewed this as a beneficial trade for the Mavericks, given that it countered their age issues while also providing them with more depth on the bench.<ref>Kelly Dwyer, \"What grabbing Shawn Marion means to Dallas\", Ball Don't Lie, Yahoo! Sports, July 7, 2009, https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/What-grabbing-Shawn-Marion-means-to-Dallas?urn=nba,175211</ref> The Mavericks also added veteran forwards [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]], [[Drew Gooden]], and [[Quinton Ross]].\n\n[[File:Jason Terry.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jason Terry spent eight years with the Mavericks, playing both of the teams' NBA Finals.]]\nThese moves proved successful, because after dropping the season opener to the [[2009\u201310 Washington Wizards season|Wizards]], the Mavericks went on to beat many contenders such as the [[2009\u201310 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]], [[2009\u201310 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]], [[2009\u201310 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]], and the [[2009\u201310 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]].\n\nA day before the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a deal. The trade sent [[Josh Howard]], [[James Singleton (basketball)|James Singleton]], and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in exchange for [[Caron Butler]], [[Brendan Haywood]], and [[Deshawn Stevenson]]. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Some NBA analysts felt that this was a good move, because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast, with many believing that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through.<ref>Marc Stein, \"Butler to Mavs, Wiz get Howard\", ESPN, February 14, 2010, http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nba/news/story?id=4912262</ref><ref>Christopher Reina, \"Grading The Deal: Mavs Become Title Contenders With Butler, Haywood\", RealGM Basketball, February 13, 2010, http://basketball.realgm.com/article/209154/Grading-The-Deal-Mavs-Become-Title-Contenders-With-Butler-Haywood</ref> The trade clearly worked, because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128\u201378. This was the third largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] 83\u201377. The Mavericks finished the season with a 55\u201327 record, good enough for the second seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks then entered the post-season with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could seriously contend for a title.\n\nDuring the playoffs though, this optimism proved to be short lived, because after winning game one 100\u201394, behind Nowitzki's 36-point performance, the Mavericks dropped the next three games to their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, before winning game five. Dallas would eventually lose against San Antonio in six games 97\u201387, leading to yet another off-season full of speculation, mostly centering on franchise player Dirk Nowitzki's pending free agent status.\n\n====2010\u20132011: Championship season====\n\n{{see also|2011 NBA Finals}}\n[[File:Mark Cuban at the Championship parade.jpg|thumb|right|Mavericks owner [[Mark Cuban]] holding the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]] during the championship parade.]]\nAfter yet another first round exit, the Mavericks began an unexpectedly early off-season. The first order of business for [[Mark Cuban]] and the Mavericks was to re-sign [[Dirk Nowitzki]], and they did so on July 4, 2010, when the Mavericks and Nowitzki agreed to a four-year deal worth $80&nbsp;million. On July 13, the Mavericks, after losing the opportunity to sign [[LeBron James]], [[Dwyane Wade]], or [[Amar'e Stoudemire]], acquired centers [[Tyson Chandler]] and [[Alexis Ajinca]] from the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] for center [[Erick Dampier]], forward [[Eduardo N\u00e1jera]] and guard [[Matt Carroll (basketball)|Matt Carroll]]. According to ''[[USA Today]]'', this trade was one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history; Chandler \"was the perfect fit during his first season with the Mavericks, anchoring their defense on the way to the franchise's first championship.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/02/16/most-one-sided-trades-nba-history-kobe-bryant-vlade-divac/80398520/|title=The most lopsided trades in NBA history|website=USA Today}}</ref>\n\nThe 2010\u201311 campaign saw the Mavericks fly out of the gate, winning 24 out of their first 29 games. However, on December 27, Dirk Nowitzki sustained a knee injury that derailed the Mavericks momentum, combined with the team's second-leading scorer [[Caron Butler]] suffering a season-ending knee injury himself only four nights later, raising questions of if the Mavericks could make it 11 straight 50-win seasons. The Mavericks then went on to drop seven of their next nine games, causing serious concern as to who would lead the offense in Nowitzki's absence. This however would prove to only be a temporary setback because Nowitzki only missed nine games, and admittedly rushed back to assist the Mavericks' reeling offense and consequently they quickly returned to their winning ways. The Mavericks re-invented their defensive reputation around the league during the 2010\u201311 campaign, mostly in part to off-season acquisition Tyson Chandler (who was later named to the All-Defensive Second Team).<ref>Jeff Caplan, \"Dirk: Chandler helps Mavs D\", ESPN Dallas, http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nba/news/story?id=5939497</ref> The Mavericks battled the San Antonio Spurs all season long for the division title, but instead settled for the 3rd seed, with a 57\u201325 record. However, due to the Mavericks bad reputation on struggling during the playoffs, many predicted them to be ousted in the first round against the six-seeded [[Portland Trail Blazers]].<ref>\"Expert Picks\", 2011 NBA Playoffs \u2013 First Round \u2013 Trailblazers vs. Mavericks \u2013 ESPN, http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2011/matchup/_/teams/trailblazers-mavericks</ref> Yahoo! Sports analyst [[Adrian Wojnarowski]] even went so far as to predict a sweep for the Trail Blazers.\n\nThe Mavs won games 1 and 2 on their home floor in convincing fashion. However, upon their arrival to the Rose Garden in Portland, problems began to arise. After dropping game three to Portland, the Mavericks blew a 23-point fourth-quarter lead in game four to allow Portland to tie the series at two games apiece. The whispers then began to re-surface that the Mavericks were going to allow another impressive regular season to go down the drain.<ref>Jason Quick, \"Trail Blazers-Mavericks: Game 5 will reveal psychological impact of dramatic Portland comeback\", Oregon Live, April 24, 2011, http://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/index.ssf/2011/04/trail_blazers-mavericks_game_5.html</ref> The Mavericks then responded, posting back-to-back wins to oust the Blazers in six games. They then met the two-time defending champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in the Western Conference Semi-finals. This series was the first time that [[Kobe Bryant]] had met Dirk Nowitzki in a playoff series and was expected to be extremely competitive; that however did not prove to be the case. The Mavericks shocked the NBA world by winning the first two games in Los Angeles, and took a two games to none lead heading back to Dallas. They then won a thrilling game three in Dallas, courtesy of 32 points from Nowitzki in a 98\u201392 victory. The Mavericks then provided the perfect \"exclamation point\",<ref>Robert Dougherty, \"Lakers Vs. Mavericks Game 4 Decisively Ends L.A. Dynasty\", Yahoo!

In that game, Jason Terry set an NBA playoff record with nine three-pointers with just one miss, ousting the Lakers in a four-game sweep. The Mavericks then met the upstart [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the Western Conference Finals. Dirk Nowitzki set the tone in the series in game one with a 48-point performance, with the Mavericks taking game 1 by a score of 121\u2013112. The Thunder then responded with 106\u2013100 victory in game 2. The Mavericks then won the next three games, including a 15-point comeback in game 4, to take the series in five games. The Mavericks claimed their second Western Conference Championship in franchise history, and met the team that defeated them in the 2006 NBA Finals, the [[Miami Heat]].\n\nThe Mavs entered the 2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miami's \"Big Three\" coming together during the course of the 2010\u201311 NBA Playoffs. After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92\u201384, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88\u201373, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0\u20132 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22\u20135 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88\u201386. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112\u2013103, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105\u201395 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \"soft\", and putting an end to the Mavericks' post-season futility.\n\n====2011\u20132013: Post-championship struggles and later absence from playoffs====\nThe 2011\u201312 season was shortened to 66 games due to a [[2011 NBA lockout|lockout]], which meant the Mavericks had to wait until [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|Christmas Day]] to raise their first championship banner. During the brief off-season, owner Mark Cuban decided to maintain financial flexibility by letting Tyson Chandler, DeShawn Stevenson, J. J. Barea and Caron Butler go. Chandler signed with the [[New York Knicks]], Stevenson joined the [[New Jersey Nets]], Barea went to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]], and Butler joined the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. Meanwhile, they acquired incumbent [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award|NBA Sixth Man of the Year]] [[Lamar Odom]] via a trade with the Lakers, while signing veterans [[Vince Carter]] and [[Delonte West]].\n\nThe Mavericks raised their championship banner prior to their Finals rematch with the Heat on Christmas Day, but in what would soon become a mirror image of the [[2006\u201307 Miami Heat season|2006\u201307 Heat]]'s eventual failed title defense, Miami blew them out in a 105\u201394 loss, marking Dallas's first regular-season loss to Miami in eight seasons. Things did not get better for Dallas after starting the season 0\u20133, losing to the Thunder in a playoff rematch on December 29. As the calendar turned to 2012, the Mavericks won 13 of 18 games in January, but they posted a 22\u201322 record the rest of the way, eventually finishing 7th with a 36\u201330 record, their lowest finish since the 2007\u201308 season. Nowitzki produced 21.6 points, 6 rebounds and 45.7% shooting, his lowest numbers since the 2000\u201301 season. Meanwhile, Odom proved to be a bad fit for the Mavericks, and they decided to sit him out for the final two months of the season.\n\nIn a rematch from the previous year, the Mavericks faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the [[2012 NBA Playoffs]]. Games 1 and 2 went down the wire, but the Mavericks fell short on both occasions as Kevin Durant made a game-winning jumper in Game 1, and with late-game free throws in Game 2. Back in Dallas for Game 3, the Mavericks suffered a 95\u201379 defeat to fall behind 0\u20133. In Game 4, the Mavericks led for much of the second half, but [[James Harden]]'s 15-point fourth quarter rallied the Thunder to a 103\u201397 win and eliminated the Mavericks from contention. It marked the first time Dallas was swept in a seven-game series, and they became the third defending champion to be swept in the first round after the aforementioned 2006\u201307 Heat and the 1956\u201357 Philadelphia Warriors.\n\nDuring the 2012 off-season, the Mavericks lost both Jason Kidd and Jason Terry to free agency. Kidd signed with the New York Knicks, while Terry joined the [[Boston Celtics]]. Brendan Haywood was later amnestied before moving to the [[Charlotte Bobcats]]. The Mavericks acquired [[Darren Collison]] from the [[Indiana Pacers]] and signed [[O. J. Mayo]] from the [[Memphis Grizzlies]]. Also joining the team were former All-Stars [[Chris Kaman]] and [[Elton Brand]].\n\nThe [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]] was a struggle for the Mavericks, as Nowitzki recovered from knee surgery and missed 29 games. In addition, Collison was inexperienced at the point, leading the Mavericks to sign veteran [[Derek Fisher]] for nine games,<ref>Sefko, Eddie, \"Mavericks to sign veteran point guard Derek Fisher on Thursday\", SportsDayDFW, Dallas Morning News, November 28, 2013 [http://mavsblog.dallasnews.com/2012/11/mavericks-to-sign-veteran-point-guard-derek-fisher-on-thursday.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031060220/http://mavsblog.dallasnews.com/2012/11/mavericks-to-sign-veteran-point-guard-derek-fisher-on-thursday.html/ |date=October 31, 2014 }}</ref> before settling on [[Mike James (basketball, born 1975)|Mike James]]. Mayo was the team's leading scorer for the first two months of the season before Nowitzki's return saw his averages dip. Kaman and Brand were also hounded by injuries. The Mavericks were 23\u201329 at the All-Star break, before making a late push for a playoff berth. Still, it did not save their season, and the Mavericks missed the playoffs for the first time since 2000.\n\n====2013\u20132016: Return to the playoffs====\nDuring the 2013 off-season, the Mavericks chose not to re-sign role players Collison, Brand, and Kaman. Mayo then declined to exercise his player option, and later signed with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. The Mavericks signed [[Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (basketball)|Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n]] from the [[Detroit Pistons]] and [[Monta Ellis]] from the Bucks. They also signed veteran [[Samuel Dalembert]].\n\nOn April 4, 2014, the Mavericks swept the season-series with the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time since the 1980\u201381 season with a 107\u201395 win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400490015|title=Dirk Nowitzki's 27 help Mavs beat 2nd L.A. team in as many nights|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Mavericks finished 49\u201333, one game ahead of Phoenix for the eighth and final playoff spot, which meant that they would once again have to face their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, who were the top seed in the Western Conference with a 62\u201320 record. In Game 1 in San Antonio, Dallas had an 81\u201371 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1, 85\u201390. However, the Mavs forced 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113\u201392, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108\u2013106 with 1.7 seconds left, but a buzzer-beater by [[Vince Carter]] gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2\u20131 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93\u201389 despite a late Dallas comeback after the Spurs at one point had a 20-point lead and later won Game 5 at home, 109\u2013103, giving them a 3\u20132 series lead. The Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111\u2013113. Game 7 was on the Spurs home court, and the Spurs beat the Mavericks 119\u201396, putting an end to the Mavericks' season.\n\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Mavericks made several moves, the first of which was trading for Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton from the New York Knicks, sending Calder\u00f3n, Dalembert, Shane Larkin, and Wayne Ellington as well as two-second-round draft picks, on June 26, 2014, right before the draft. Nowitzki also took a generous discount, re-signing for three years and $25&nbsp;million, which helped Dallas sign restricted free agent [[Chandler Parsons]] from the Houston Rockets to a three-year contract at $46&nbsp;million. Devin Harris was re-signed, for four years and $16&nbsp;million. Dallas brought in [[Richard Jefferson]], [[Al-Farouq Aminu]], [[Jameer Nelson]], [[Greg Smith (basketball, born 1991)|Greg Smith]] to build a deep bench. The Mavs' sixth man, Vince Carter, left in free agency to the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nOn November 13, 2014, the Mavericks recorded their largest  victory ever with a 123\u201370 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. The 53-point margin for Dallas surpassed its 50-point win over the New York Knicks in January 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20141113/PHIDAL/gameinfo.html|title=76ers at Mavericks|publisher=National Basketball Association|accessdate=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906114536/http://www.nba.com/games/20141113/PHIDAL/gameinfo.html|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Two days later, they scored 131 points to record their biggest point tally since 2009 in the win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20141115/MINDAL/gameinfo.html|title=Timberwolves at Mavericks|publisher=National Basketball Association|accessdate=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317214322/http://www.nba.com/games/20141115/MINDAL/gameinfo.html|archive-date=March 17, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn December 18, 2014, the Mavericks sent [[Jae Crowder]], Jameer Nelson, Brandan Wright, a 2015 first-round pick and a 2016 second-round pick to the [[Boston Celtics]] for [[Rajon Rondo]] and [[Dwight Powell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mavs.com/mavs-acquire-rajon-rondo-dwight-powell-from-celtics/|title=Mavs acquire four-time All-Star Rajon Rondo|work=mavs.com|date=December 18, 2014|accessdate=December 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219043216/http://www.mavs.com/mavs-acquire-rajon-rondo-dwight-powell-from-celtics/|archive-date=December 19, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn April 28, 2015, the Mavericks were knocked out of the first round by their in state rivals, the Houston Rockets, in a 4\u20131 series loss. After going down 3\u20130 in a Game 3 overtime, the Mavericks managed to win one on their homecourt before losing in Houston in the clinching game, 103\u201394. The Mavericks were the seventh seed in the playoffs and finished the season 50\u201332.\n\nOn April 25, 2016, the Mavericks were once again knocked out of the first round, this time by the Oklahoma City Thunder in a 4\u20131 series loss. After managing to win a game at OKC and tying the series 1\u20131, the Mavericks lost three straight to lose the series. This series was marked by physicality by both teams, including a Kevin Durant Flagrant 2 foul and several Mavericks playing very aggressive defense on Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.\n\n====2016\u20132019: Lottery return, Dirk's final years and Don\u010di\u0107 rookie season====\nThe Mavericks did not make the playoffs during the 2016\u201317 season, despite efforts from their newest additions, [[Seth Curry]], [[Harrison Barnes]], [[Nerlens Noel]], and [[Yogi Ferrell]]. They began the season going 3\u201315 through their first 18 games, and could not bounce back, finishing at a 33\u201349 record despite fighting towards a winning record, even reaching a 28\u201336 record partway through the season. This was the second time in 17 years they missed the playoffs, with the other being the 2012\u20132013 season. The season marked the first time the team finished with a losing record since the 1999\u20132000 season.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks received the ninth pick in the [[2017 NBA draft]] and used it to select point guard [[Dennis Smith Jr.]] out of [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|North Carolina State]]. They began the 2017\u201318 season 3\u201315 through their first eighteen games as in the year prior and concluded it on a 2\u201312 slump to finish with a 24\u201358 record despite a solid rookie season from Smith Jr., who averaged 15.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 5.2 assists over 69 games.

However, in the 1992\u201393 season, they went back to their original road uniform scheme from their expansion season, with minor alterations to the \"Dallas\" script, a design that the Mavericks used until 2001. From 1980 to 2001, the home white uniforms had \"Mavericks\" in blue, with green and white trim, with a few minor alterations to the \"Mavericks\" script during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportslogos.net/team.php?id=228 |title=Dallas Mavericks&nbsp;\u2013 Chris Creamer's Sports Logos Page |publisher=Sportslogos.net |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> The 1980s green road jerseys were revived in the 2004\u201305 season as part of the Mavericks' 25th anniversary.  However, while the lettering from the 1980s uniform was present, the number scheme resembled the 1993\u20132001 uniforms. The green uniforms would be revived again in the 2015\u201316 season, still with the 1990s number scheme.\n\n[[File:Dallas mavericks wordmark.gif|thumb|right|The Dallas Mavericks' wordmark logo.]]\nIn the [[2001\u201302 NBA season]], the Mavericks drastically updated their logos and uniforms, with a new [[Dallas Cowboys]]-inspired color scheme of midnight blue, royal blue and silver. The new uniforms consist of a \"Dallas\" script on both the home and road jerseys.  On the home jersey, \"Dallas\" is in midnight blue across the chest and the numbers are in royal blue with silver trim, while on the road jersey, \"Dallas\" is in white, with the numbers in silver and white trim.\n\nIn the [[2003\u201304 NBA season]], the Mavericks debuted their shiny silver alternate uniforms, with \"Mavericks\" in white and royal blue trim, with blue numerals. However, it proved to be unpopular with fans (thus derisively nicknamed the 'Trash Bags'), and it was scrapped after just one game (at [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] on October 28, 2003).\n\nIn the [[2004\u201305 NBA season]], the Mavericks introduced an alternate green uniform similar to their 1980s road uniforms. They were designed by rapper [[Sean Combs|Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs]], and featured \"Mavs\" in white on the front side of the jersey with blue trim, and the numbers in silver with white trim above the script on the left chest.\n\nOn September 21, 2009, the Mavericks unveiled a new alternate royal blue uniform with the same \"Mavs\" script, replacing the green uniform. The said uniform will also be used for the NBA's Noche Latina promotion, with the wordmark \"Los Mavs.\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Todd |url=http://mavsblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/09/mavericks-debut-a-new-alternate-jersey.html |title=Mavericks debut a new alternate jersey &#124; News for Dallas, Texas |work=The Dallas Morning News |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708222341/http://mavsblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/09/mavericks-debut-a-new-alternate-jersey.html |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn August 19, 2010, the Mavericks unveiled yet another change to their uniform set, with a new royal blue road uniform that displays the \"Dallas\" script in navy blue with silver numbers, both with white trim.

The uniform was selected among thousands of entries as part of a design-a-uniform contest the Mavericks initiated during the 2013\u201314 season, but was not worn until the 2015\u201316 season.\n\nWith the switch to [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] as the uniform supplier in 2017, the home and away uniform designations were eliminated. In its place are the \"Icon\" uniforms, \"Association\" uniforms, \"Statement\" uniforms and \"City\" uniforms. The Mavericks' white uniforms are part of the \"Association\" set, the royal blue uniforms are identified with the \"Icon\" set, and the navy blue uniforms are included in the \"Statement\" set.\n\nFor the \"City\" set, the Mavericks wore black uniforms with \"DAL\" and the numbers in royal blue with neon green trim (a nod to the original Mavericks' colors). This set was worn only during the 2017\u201318 season, after which a new \"City\" uniform would be designed. The new \"City\" uniform was unveiled in November 2018. The \"DAL\" across the chest was replaced with the team's secondary logo and the neon green trim was removed, with the numbers no longer having a trim color. The \"City\" uniform for the 2019\u201320 season featured a stylized \"MAVS\" wordmark inspired from [[graffiti]] paintings. The uniform base had a light blue/navy blue gradient and neon green trim.\n\nPrior to the 2019\u201320 season, the Mavericks drastically redesigned their navy \"Statement\" uniforms, eliminating the Dallas skyline and reverting to the full team name \"Mavericks\" in front. The uniform contains white lettering and white and royal blue side stripes.\n\n==Head coaches==\n{{Main|List of Dallas Mavericks head coaches}}\n[[File:Rick Carlisle.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Rick Carlisle]], head coach since 2008.]]\nThere have been nine&nbsp;[[head coach]]es for the Mavericks franchise.

First they came head to head in the [[2006 NBA Finals]], in which the two teams captured their first respective conference titles. The Mavericks came into the series 60\u201322 with a strong group of players while the Miami Heat came in with a respectable 52\u201330 record and sported an aging but still strong [[Shaquille O'Neal]] as well as an up-and-coming [[Dwyane Wade]]. Dallas was favored by many in the media to win the series. The Dallas Mavericks won the first two games but Miami went on to sweep the next four and win the NBA championship for the first time in team history.\n\nBoth teams saw success over the next few seasons and appeared in the playoffs multiple times, and would ultimately go on to have a rematch in the [[2011 NBA Finals]]. It was also the first time that either team had reached the Finals since 2006. This time, however, Miami was favored to win after a highly publicized event when Miami signed [[LeBron James]] and [[Chris Bosh]] to their roster. Dallas came in with a 57\u201325 record while the Heat came in 58\u201324. Miami won the first game 92\u201384, but Dallas went on to win four of the next five and upset the Heat to win the first title in franchise history.\n\n===San Antonio Spurs===\n{{main|Mavericks\u2013Spurs rivalry}}\n\nThe Mavericks-Spurs rivalry is relatively new but very fierce. It features two teams with Dallas roots\u2014the Spurs began their life in the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] as the Dallas Chaparrals and did not move to San Antonio until 1973. On October 11, 1980, the Mavs made their NBA debut by defeating the Spurs 103\u201392. The teams have met numerous times in the playoffs, with the Spurs defeating the Mavericks in 2001, 2003, 2010, and 2014, while the Mavericks defeated the Spurs in 2006 and 2009. The Spurs have won five championships and six conference titles, while the Mavericks have won one championship and two conference titles. The Spurs have won 15 division titles, while the Mavericks have won 3. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks have 3 60-win seasons. This is known as the \"I-35 rivalry\" because both cities lie on [[Interstate 35]].\n\nThe two teams met in the playoffs during the 2000\u20132001 season with the Spurs winning in five games. Little was made during this series, as the Spurs won their first NBA championship only two years before. The Mavericks, run by a trio of [[Steve Nash]], [[Michael Finley]], and [[Dirk Nowitzki]], had just defeated the [[Utah Jazz]] despite not having home court advantage and were only starting to meld into a title contender.\n\nThe two teams met again in 2003 in the Western Conference Finals. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks had 60-win seasons and reached the Western Conference Finals after defeating the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Sacramento Kings]], respectively. Despite having the best season of their history, the Mavericks fell in six games to the Spurs.\n\nThe rivalry took on a new meaning in 2005 when, near the end of the regular season, [[Don Nelson]] would resign as head coach of the Mavericks, apparently satisfied with the state of the team, and hand the coaching reins to former Spur [[Avery Johnson]], the [[point guard]] of the 1999 NBA champion Spurs team who hit the game-winning shot against the [[New York Knicks]]. Since Johnson was coached under Spurs' Head Coach [[Gregg Popovich]], he would be familiar with most, if not all, of Popovich's coaching style and philosophy. During the 2005 offseason, [[Michael Finley]], waived by the Mavericks under the amnesty clause, joined the Spurs in search for the elusive title.\n\nDuring the 2006 playoffs the two rivals met again. San Antonio won the first game at home 87\u201385. The Mavericks got revenge the next game, winning 113\u201391 and evening the series up at 1\u20131. The Mavericks then won a dramatic Game 3 by a single point, 104\u2013103. Though Manu Gin\u00f3bili could have made a game-winning basket with five seconds on the clock, he committed an error, allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly-contested Game 4 123\u2013118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]], who fouled Dirk on the play, had just given San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation, was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime. The Mavericks, meanwhile, were set to take control of the game and they did just that, winning 119\u2013111. The Mavericks went on to the Conference Finals where they defeated the Suns in six games, but succumbed to the champion Heat in the NBA Finals.\n\nDespite much anticipation of a renewed meeting in the 2007 Western Conference finals, the Mavericks lost to the Golden State Warriors in one of the greatest upsets in NBA history. The Spurs won the NBA finals after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10005744 |title=Dallas Mavericks Upset by Oakland Upstarts |publisher=NPR |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> The eighth seed Warriors, who made the playoffs on the last game of the NBA season, defeated the 67-win, first-seed Mavericks in six games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270503009 |title=ESPN&nbsp;\u2013 Dallas vs. Golden State Recap, May 3, 2007 |publisher=ESPN |date=May 3, 2007 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Spurs would ultimately go on to win the 2007 NBA Championship, establishing themselves as a true NBA dynasty.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=3281217&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 Sweep!

[[Joey Crawford]], the referee who ejected Duncan, allegedly asked Duncan to a fight which led to the longtime ref's season-ending suspension. As Duncan was heading into the locker room, [[American Airlines Center]] erupted into a huge cheer, applauding Duncan's ejection. The game saw chippy play, with [[Jerry Stackhouse]] and [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] getting into an altercation after a rebound.\n\nIn the 2009 NBA Playoffs, the Mavericks and Spurs squared off again in the first round.  The Spurs and Mavericks split the first two games in San Antonio, but Dallas defeated the Spurs in games 3 and 4, both in Dallas. The Mavericks then went on to close out the series and eliminated the Spurs at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.\n\nIn 2010, the Dallas Mavericks matched up against the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs. Although the Mavericks managed to obtain the number two seed, they were defeated by the Spurs in six games.\n\nDuring the 2011 playoffs, a role reversal of sorts occurred between the two rivals, when the top seeded Spurs were defeated by the eighth seeded [[Memphis Grizzlies]], the first time an eight seed defeated a one seed since the infamous Mavs-Warriors series of 2007.  In addition, the Mavericks defeated the LeBron James-led [[Miami Heat]] in the NBA Finals, similar again to how the 2007 Spurs defeated a LeBron James-led [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] team in the Finals.\n\nThe Mavericks were swept in the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]] by the Spurs for the first time since the [[1997\u20131998 NBA season|1998 season]], Tim Duncan's rookie season. In their last match up of the season, San Antonio escaped with a 92\u201391 victory over Dallas when a [[Vince Carter]] 3-point attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer. With the win the Spurs clinched a playoff spot for the 16th straight season, currently the longest streak in the NBA. San Antonio also reached 50 wins for the 14th straight season, the longest streak in NBA history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278687|title=Spurs edge Mavericks to sweep season series|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2013\u201314 season]], the Spurs once again swept the Mavs in the regular season, giving them nine straight victories. In addition, an overtime loss to the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] on April 16, 2014 ensured that the Mavericks would face the Spurs once again in the [[2014 NBA Playoffs]], where the Mavs would be the eighth seed and San Antonio the first. In Game 1 in San Antonio, the game was relatively close. Dallas managed to reach an 81\u201371 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1 at home, 85\u201390. However, the Mavs managed to force 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113\u201392, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] managed to hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108\u2013106 with 1.7 left, but a buzzer beater by [[Vince Carter]] gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2\u20131 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93\u201389 and later Game 5 at home 109\u2013103, giving them a 3\u20132 lead. Luckily, the Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111\u2013113. The Spurs won game 7 119\u201396, eliminating the Mavericks in the first round.\n\n===Phoenix Suns===\nDuring the 2004 off-season, former Dallas Mavericks point guard [[Steve Nash]] signed a free-agent deal with the 29\u201353 [[Phoenix Suns]] to help out their offense. The addition of Nash helped as Phoenix rolled to a 62\u201320 record and the best record in the NBA. The teams met in the Western Conference Semi-finals with Phoenix having the home-court advantage.\n\nPhoenix won Game One 127\u2013102 with a 40-point game by [[Amar'e Stoudemire]]. Steve Nash was also given his [[NBA MVP]] award during that game, a game in which he terrorized his former team. However, Mavericks star [[Dirk Nowitzki]] hit a game-winning turn-around jumper in Game 2 to beat Phoenix 108\u2013106 to send the series back to Dallas tied 1\u20131. Phoenix and Dallas split the two games in [[Dallas]] which saw both winners of games score 119 points. The series went back Phoenix then took care of Dallas 114\u2013108 in the [[America West Arena]] (now US Airways Center). Then, in Game Six, with Dallas facing elimination, Phoenix beat Dallas in a thriller which saw [[Steve Nash]] with a 39-point game, to go along with 12 assists. Phoenix then made it to the Western Conference Finals, where they eventually lost to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] who then went on to win the NBA Title that season.\n\nThe following year, a Suns team without Stoudemire (who was injured), [[Joe Johnson (basketball)|Joe Johnson]], and [[Quentin Richardson]], but with a core of new players led by [[Raja Bell]] (who clotheslined Lakers star [[Kobe Bryant]] in a first-round series game), [[Boris Diaw]] and [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]] to go along with Nash and fellow All-Star [[Shawn Marion]]. Phoenix had to play seven game series against the two Los Angeles teams, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] (who had a 3\u20131 lead against Phoenix) and the resurgent [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. They faced a Mavericks team who won 60 games, but were forced to be the fourth seed since the division winners got the top three seeds. On their way to the Western Conference Finals, Dallas swept the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], and beat in-state rival [[San Antonio Spurs]] in seven tense games. Phoenix won Game One 121\u2013118 after Diaw hit a game-winning shot in the dying seconds of the fourth quarter. Bell, though injured himself in Game One, missing Games Two and Three. After that, Dallas took control of the series, winning Games Two and Three by the scores of 105\u201398 and 95\u201388. Bell came back for Game Four and led Phoenix to a 106\u201386 blowout win. Dallas however, beat Phoenix 117\u2013101 in Game Five which included a 50-point performance from Dirk Nowitzki, and eliminated the Suns in Phoenix 102\u201393 in Game Six. Dallas would later on lose to the [[Miami Heat]] in six games, despite winning the first two games.\n\nOn March 14, 2007 in Dallas, Phoenix beat Dallas in a 129\u2013127 double overtime thriller. With the Mavericks up by 7 with a minute left in regulation, Dirk Nowitzki (a 90% free throw shooter) missed two free throws. Steve Nash fed off his mistakes and scored 10 straight points including the game-tying three-pointer with 3 seconds left to go. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-winning shot bounced off the rim and sent the game to overtime. [[Jason Terry]] sent the game into another overtime with a game-tying three-pointer of his own. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-tying shot in double overtime went in and out of the rim as Amar'e Stoudemire's 41 points were too much for Dallas to handle.\n\nOn April 10, 2013, the Mavericks 12-season playoff streak, since [[2000\u201301 Dallas Mavericks season|2001]], ended in a loss to the Suns 102\u201391.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278889|title=Mavs eliminated from playoff contention for first time since 2000|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn April 12, 2014 the Mavs handed the Suns one of three straight losses to keep them out of the playoffs, 101\u201398. The other losses from rival San Antonio and the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\n===Houston Rockets===\n{{main|Mavericks\u2013Rockets rivalry}}\n\nAn NBA intrastate rivalry, both in Texas linked by I-45, as well as both Dallas and Houston fans traditionally having a disdain for each other's city, the rivalry started when the Mavericks were the last Texas team to join the NBA. This is also known as the I-45 rivalry because they both lie on [[Interstate 45]]. In the Mavs' inaugural season in 1980\u201381, the Rockets won all six meetings including a 116\u201368 blowout win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198102040HOU.html|title=Dallas Mavericks at Houston Rockets Box Score, February 4, 1981|work=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> In the playoffs, the Mavericks defeated the Rockets in the 1988, and 2005 playoffs, the latter of which was plagued with allegations of game fixing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.chron.com/ultimaterockets/2008/06/donaghy-points-smoking-gun-at-rockets-series-misfires/|title=Donaghy points smoking gun at Rockets series, misfires|work=Ultimate Rockets|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> and the Rockets swept several season series with the Mavericks during the 1990s during the Rockets' championship years. On April 11, 1995 the Mavericks were able to get one of their most superb victories against the Houston reigning champion for 156\u2013147 scoring 23 points in the first overtime. Two years later, the Rockets and Mavericks have clashed in their first ever regular season's game played in [[Mexico City]] and won by the Rockets 108\u2013106. In recent years the rivalry has once again flourished with Dallas owner [[Mark Cuban]] and Rockets general manager [[Daryl Morey]] taking shots at each other on social media, as well as Houston fan favorite [[Chandler Parsons]] signing an offer sheet to leave the Rockets to sign with the rival Mavericks for $46&nbsp;million, while making negative statements about the city of Houston upon leaving,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://houston.cbslocal.com/2014/10/08/chandler-parsons-calls-houston-dirty/|title=Chandler Parsons Calls Houston \u2018Dirty\u2019|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> causing massive backlash among Rockets fans. Finally, longtime Mavericks' player [[Jason Terry]], who was a starter on the Mavs' 2011 championship team, joined the Rockets for the [[2014\u201315 NBA season|2015 season]], and both teams met in the first round of the [[2015 NBA Playoffs]], with the Rockets as the 2nd seed and Mavericks the 7th seed, and the Rockets got the best of them 4\u20131.\n\n===Los Angeles Lakers===\nThe rivalry between the Lakers and Mavericks began in the 1980s during the Lakers' [[Showtime (basketball)|Showtime era]]. In the [[1984 NBA Playoffs]], the Lakers won over the Mavericks in the Western Conference Semi-finals with the series 4\u20131. In 1986, they met again in the semi-finals and the Lakers won the series 4\u20132. In the [[1988 NBA Playoffs]], the Lakers, who were the defending champions, defeated the Mavericks in a seven-game series in the Western Conference Finals and eventually became the back-to-back champions after winning the [[1988 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. In 2011, the Mavericks met the two-time defending champions Lakers in the semi-finals and rejected their three-peat by sweeping them in four games and eventually won the [[2011 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. In Game 2 of the [[2011 NBA Playoffs]], [[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]] was ejected for hitting [[J. J. Barea]] and suspended for Game 3. In Game 4, [[Lamar Odom]] was ejected for pushing [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and then [[Andrew Bynum]] was ejected for elbowing [[J. J. Barea]]. Both players received flagrant foul 2. After the [[2011 NBA lockout]], Lamar Odom was sent to the Mavericks after he requested to leave the Lakers due to the vetoed Chris Paul trade. Andrew Bynum made a formal apology for what he did to Barea before the start of the following season.\n\n===Sacramento Kings===\nThe rivalry between the Kings and Mavericks could very well be traced to the similar styles of plays of [[Chris Webber]], [[Dirk Nowitzki]], [[Mike Bibby]], [[Steve Nash]], [[Peja Stojakovi\u0107]], and [[Michael Finley]] and the similar coaching styles of [[Rick Adelman]] and [[Don Nelson]]. In the [[2002 NBA Playoffs]] the Kings defeated the Mavericks four games to one in the semi-finals, in the [[2003 NBA Playoffs]] the table were turned and Mavericks defeated the Kings four games to three in the semi-finals. However, the tables were turned once more and in the [[2004 NBA Playoffs]] the Kings defeated the Mavericks once again four games to one in the quarterfinals. Since that time, free agency and trades would dull the rivalry and the teams have not met in the playoffs since.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n''List of the last five seasons completed by the Mavericks.

They compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]]. The team plays its home games at the [[American Airlines Center]], which it shares with the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Dallas Stars]].\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the Mavericks were a perennial playoff team, led by [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Stars]] [[Rolando Blackman]] and [[Mark Aguirre]]. The team struggled during the 1990s, entering into a period of rebuilding. In 1998, the franchise's fortunes would change drastically with the acquisition of [[Dirk Nowitzki]], who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history, leading the team to its first NBA championship in [[2011 NBA Finals|2011]].\n\nAs of the 2017 season, the Mavericks have sold out 707 consecutive games since December 15, 2002, the longest currently running sellout streak in North American major league sports.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.star-telegram.com/sports/nba/dallas-mavericks/article118601658.html|title=Poor start to season could put Dallas Mavericks\u2019 sellout streak in jeopardy|newspaper=Star-Telegram|accessdate=August 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince their [[1980\u201381 Dallas Mavericks season|inaugural 1980\u201381 season]], the Mavericks have won three division titles ([[1986\u201387 NBA season|1987]], [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2007]], [[2009\u201310 NBA season|2010]]), two conference championships ([[2006 NBA Finals|2006]], [[2011 NBA Finals|2011]]), and one [[NBA championship]] ([[2011 NBA Finals|2011]]).\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{Main|History of the Dallas Mavericks}}\n{{See also|List of Dallas Mavericks seasons}}\n\n===1978\u20131981: Birth of the Mavericks===\nIn 1978, Californian businessman Garn Eckardt met [[Dallas]] lawyer Doug Adkins, and mentioned he was trying to raise capital to move an NBA team to the city. Asking for a possible partner, Adkins recommended him one of his clients, [[Home Interiors and Gifts]] owner [[Don Carter (businessman)|Don Carter]]. Negotiations with Eckardt fell through, but Carter remained interested in the enterprise as a gift to his wife Linda, who played basketball while at [[Duncanville High School]]. At the same time, [[Buffalo Braves]] president and general manager [[Norm Sonju]] developed an interest in bringing the NBA to Dallas as he studied possible new locations for the ailing franchise. While the Braves went to California as the [[San Diego Clippers]], Sonju eventually returned to Texas, and was introduced to Carter by mayor [[Robert Folsom]], one of the owners and team president of the last professional basketball team in the city, the Dallas Chaparrals of the [[American Basketball Association]], which moved to [[San Antonio]] in 1973 to become the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. Sonju and Carter tried purchasing both the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] and the [[Kansas City Kings]], but disagreement on relocation stalled the negotiations, leading them to instead aim for an [[expansion team]].\n\nThe league was initially reluctant to expand to Dallas, given Texas had both the Spurs and [[Houston Rockets]], and the [[1978\u201379 NBA season]] was proving unprofitable (18 out of the 22 teams lost money) and unpopular (television ratings fell 26 percent). Still, during the [[1979 NBA All-Star Game]] weekend, [[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA commissioner]] [[Larry O'Brien]] announced the league would add two new teams in the [[1980\u201381 NBA season|1980\u201381 season]], with teams in Dallas and [[Minneapolis]]. Once the Minnesota team backed out (it would not be until 1989 that Minneapolis would get another NBA team when the [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Timberwolves]] started play), only Dallas remained, and through negotiations with general counselor and future commissioner [[David Stern]], the expansion fee was settled on the $12.5&nbsp;million. Carter would provide half the amount.<ref>{{cite web|last=Townsend|first=Brad|title=Archive: A look back at the birth of the Dallas Mavericks|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-mavericks/headlines/20130501-archive-a-look-back-at-the-birth-of-the-dallas-mavericks.ece|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=May 1, 2005|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-mavericks/headlines/20140130-david-stern-goes-way-back-with-mavericks-mark-cuban-praises-outgoing-commish-seriously.ece|title=David Stern goes way back with Mavericks; Mark Cuban praises outgoing commish (seriously)|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[1980 NBA All-Star Game]], league owners voted to admit the new team, with the team's name coming from the 1957\u20131962 TV western ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]''; the name was chosen by the fans with 4,600 postcards received, beating ''Wranglers'' and ''Express''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Behind The Name \u2013 Dallas Mavericks |url=http://www.nba.com/mavericks/history/behind_the_name_06.html|website=Mavs.com|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|date=December 31, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226045338/http://www.nba.com/mavericks/history/behind_the_name_06.html|archivedate=December 26, 2007|accessdate=August 16, 2015|url-status=unfit}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Scott|title=The Origins of All 30 NBA Team Names|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/23115/origins-all-30-nba-team-names|work=[[Mental Floss]]|date=October 27, 2009|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref> [[James Garner]], who played the namesake character, was a member of the ownership group.

Vandeweghe was traded to the [[Denver Nuggets]], along with a first-round pick, in 1981, in exchange for two future first-round picks that eventually materialized into [[Rolando Blackman]] in [[1981 NBA draft|1981]] and [[Sam Perkins]] in [[1984 NBA draft|1984]].\n\n[[File:Don Carter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mavs' founder [[Don Carter (businessman)|Don Carter]]]]\nIn the Mavericks' debut game, taking place in the brand-new [[Reunion Arena]], the Mavericks defeated the Spurs, 103\u201392. But the Mavs started the season with a 6\u201340 record on their way to finishing 15\u201367. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to play a very important role in the early years of their franchise. Journeyman 6&nbsp;ft 3 in guard [[Brad Davis (basketball)|Brad Davis]], who played for the [[Anchorage Northern Knights]] of the [[Continental Basketball Association]], was tracked down and signed by the Mavs in December. At the time, there was absolutely no reason to expect that Davis would be any better than the expansion-level talent the Mavs had.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} But he started the Mavs' final 26 games, led the team in assists, and his career soared. He spent the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually his number 15 jersey was retired. The Mavericks also marked the first NBA team to have a profitable debut season, with an average of 7,789 spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-10/sports/sp-2289_1_texas-football/2|title=In Texas, Winning Is the Name of the Game|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1981 NBA Draft brought three players who would become vital parts of the team. The Mavs selected 6'6\" forward [[Mark Aguirre]] with the first pick, 6'6\" guard [[Rolando Blackman]] 9th, and 6'7\" forward [[Jay Vincent]] 24th. By the end of his seven-year Mavs career, Aguirre would average 24.6 points per game. Blackman contributed 19.2 points over his 11-year career in Dallas. But it was Jay Vincent who made the biggest difference for the Mavs in their second season, leading the team in scoring with 21.4 points per game and earning NBA All-Rookie Team honors. The Mavericks improved to 28\u201354, getting out of the Midwest Division cellar as they finished above the [[Utah Jazz]].\n\n===1982\u20131990: Playoff contention===\nIn [[1982\u201383 NBA season|1982\u201383]], the Mavericks were serious contenders for the first time.  At the [[1983 NBA All-Star Game|All-Star break]], they were 25\u201324 and had won 12 of their last 15 games.  They could not sustain that momentum and finished seven games behind the Denver Nuggets for the sixth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. But the Mavs' 38\u201344 record was a 10-game improvement from the previous season.\n\nMark Aguirre led the 1982\u201383 Mavericks with 24.4 points per game, finishing sixth in the NBA. [[Jay Vincent]] and [[Rolando Blackman]] contributed 18.7 and 17.7 points per game, respectively. Brad Davis was 10th in the NBA in assists with 7.2 per game, and shot .845 from the free-throw line, 6th in the league. [[Derek Harper]] was drafted by the Mavs with the 11th pick of the [[1983 NBA draft]]. The 6&nbsp;ft 4 in guard would spend the next decade with the organization, averaging 15 points and 6.1 assists. The Mavericks' in [[1983\u201384 NBA season|1983\u201384]] posted a winning record for the first time in franchise history, finishing 43\u201339 and second in the Midwest Division. The Mavs also earned the first playoff berth in franchise history. Mark Aguirre was named the team's first NBA All-Star, as he finished with an average of 29.5 points per game\u2014second in the league to Utah's [[Adrian Dantley]].\n\nDallas finished with the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, and in their first playoff trip, they defeated the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in five games. The fifth and deciding game of that series was played at [[Moody Coliseum]], as Reunion Arena, then the home court for the Mavericks, was hosting a tennis tournament. The [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[1983\u201384 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] were next for the Mavs, and the young club fell short, losing four games to one. But a trade the Mavericks made in their inaugural season of 1980 paid off for them in 1984, because they owned [[Cleveland Cavaliers|Cleveland]]'s first-round pick, which ended up being the fourth pick overall. The Mavs used it to select forward-center [[Sam Perkins]], a former [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heel]] with a surprising range from the three-point line who would average 14.4 points and 8.0 rebounds in six seasons with Dallas.\n\nAbout this time, the [[Dallas Cowboys]], once one of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s elite teams, began a slow decline that eventually saw them fall to 1\u201315 in [[1989 Dallas Cowboys season|1989]]. The Mavs were hitting their stride at about the same time and replaced the Cowboys as the Metroplex' team. The [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1984\u201385]] team finished a game better than the previous year at 44\u201338. Mark Aguirre led the team in scoring again with 25.7 ppg, [[Sam Perkins]] made the All-Rookie team, and Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the [[1985 NBA All-Star Game]]. The Mavs returned to the [[1985 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1985]], but were not as successful as they had been the previous year. They won Game 1 in double-overtime against the [[1984\u201385 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in their first-round playoff series, but lost the next three games in a row, ending their season.\n\nDallas had the eighth pick in the [[1985 NBA draft]]\u2014again due to a trade with the Cavaliers\u2014and drafted German-born forward [[Detlef Schrempf]] out of [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]]. He would show flashes of brilliance in his three-plus seasons with the team, but it was not until he was traded to the [[Indiana Pacers]] that he displayed his full potential. The Mavericks also traded center [[Kurt Nimphius]] to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] for center [[James Donaldson (basketball)|James Donaldson]], who would play for the Mavericks until halfway through the [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392 season]]. This allowed the Mavericks to have the steady hand at the center that had been lacking throughout the franchise's first five years. In 1988, James Donaldson was the only All-Star center in Dallas Maverick history.\n\n[[Rolando Blackman]] represented the Mavericks in the [[1986 NBA All-Star Game]], hosted by Dallas at Reunion Arena. The 1985\u201386 Mavericks were second in scoring at 115.3 points per game, gaining them their third-straight playoff appearance. They defeated [[1985\u201386 Utah Jazz season|Utah]] three games to one in the first round. In the conference semi-finals, they ran into the [[1985\u201386 Los Angeles Lakers season|Lakers]] again, and L.A. defeated Dallas in six games. But four of those games were decided by four points or less, and Dallas won half of those, leaving Mavericks fans room to hope that they could finally top the Lakers in the following season. The Mavs drafted [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]] center [[Roy Tarpley]] with the seventh overall pick, who would go on to become a very talented\u2014but troubled\u2014member of the roster.\n\nThe [[1986\u201387 NBA season|1986\u201387]] Mavericks team had their most successful regular-season to date, going 55\u201327 and winning their first Midwest Division title. But despite the great expectations surrounding the team, they self-destructed in the playoffs. After hammering the [[1986\u201387 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle SuperSonics]] by 22 points in Game 1, the bottom dropped out for the Mavs, as they lost Games 2 and 3 in close fashion before succumbing in Game 4 in [[Seattle]]. Following the unexpected early playoff exit, Motta, who had been with the team since its inception, shockingly resigned as head coach. [[John MacLeod (basketball)|John MacLeod]], who had led the [[Phoenix Suns]] to nine playoff berths in 11 seasons including an NBA Finals run in 1976, was hired as his replacement.\n\nThe [[1987\u201388 NBA season]] saw the Mavericks dip just a little bit in the regular season\u2014finishing 53\u201329 and losing their Midwest Division title to the [[Denver Nuggets]]\u2014but it was another successful year for the team. [[Mark Aguirre]] and [[James Donaldson (basketball)|James Donaldson]] both played in the [[1988 NBA All-Star Game]], the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and [[Rolando Blackman]] scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and [[Roy Tarpley]] won the [[NBA Sixth Man Award]] with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the [[Houston Rockets]] in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion [[1987\u201388 Los Angeles Lakers season|Lakers]] between them and their first-ever trip to the [[1988 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle, but in the end, the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship.\n\nDespite all the changes, the Mavs remained in contention. However, their season effectively ended when James Donaldson went down with a ruptured [[patella]] tendon on March 10, 1989, and missed the rest of the season as a result. The Mavericks were left undermanned, demoralized and disheartened as they finished with a 38\u201344 record. It was their first losing season since 1982\u201383\u2014which was also the last time they missed the playoffs.\n[[File:Lipofsky Mark Aguirre.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Mark Aguirre was traded to the Detroit Pistons in 1989.]]\nThe Mavericks returned to the [[1990 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]] with a 47\u201335 record, but it was another season of off-court chaos. On November 15, only six games into the Mavs' season, Tarpley was arrested for [[driving while intoxicated]] and resisting arrest. The team started 5\u20136 and MacLeod was fired, replaced by assistant coach [[Richie Adubato]]. The Mavs finished the season with four straight victories to surge into the playoffs but went down rather meekly to the [[1989\u201390 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in three games. It would be the team's last winning season and playoff appearance until 2001.\n\n===1990\u20131998: Rebuilding===\n====1990\u20131994====\nThe team endured numerous changes in 1990, losing Sam Perkins to the Lakers via free agency and suffering injuries to practically their entire [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391]] starting lineup. The players they managed to acquire\u2014[[Rodney McCray (basketball)|Rodney McCray]], [[Fat Lever]] and [[Alex English]]\u2014were all in the twilight of their careers. On November 9 it was announced that Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own which ended his season. The Mavericks' season only got worse from there, and they finished with a record of 28\u201354, falling behind even the second-year [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] and [[Orlando Magic]]. In March 1991, Tarpley was charged with suspicion of [[driving while intoxicated]] and was suspended again by the NBA.\n \t\t\nIt got even worse in [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392]]. Before the season even began, Tarpley violated the league's substance abuse policy for the third time and was banned from the NBA for life. The former Sixth Man Award winner's fall from grace was complete. The few talented players the Mavericks had remaining to them were lost to injury. Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season\u2014hardly worth the cost of losing two first-round draft picks. The team finished with a 22\u201360 record.\n\nIn [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]], the rebuilding began in earnest, with the Mavs trading [[Rolando Blackman]]\u2014who by that point had surpassed Mark Aguirre as the team's all-time leading scorer\u2014to the [[New York Knicks]] for a first-round draft pick. Blackman had made four All-Star Game appearances in his Mavericks career. [[Herb Williams]] joined the Knicks as a free agent. Fat Lever underwent more surgery and missed the entire 1992\u201393 season. Derek Harper was the team's sole bright spot, leading the team with 18.3 points per game.\n\nThe Mavericks selected [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] guard [[Jim Jackson (basketball)|Jim Jackson]] with the fourth overall pick of the [[1992 NBA draft]], but he and owner Donald Carter could not come to terms on a contract for half of his rookie season. Jackson only played 28 games in [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]], a season that was also ruined by trades, a coaching change and injuries. The Mavericks started 2\u201327 and fired Adubato on January 13, replacing him with [[Gar Heard]]. The Mavericks came dangerously close to setting the all-time worst record in NBA history (at the time, 9\u201373 by the [[1972\u201373 NBA season|1972\u201373]] [[1972\u201373 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]]). But when Jackson was signed on March 3, the Mavs rallied, closing the season with a 7\u201314 mark, including two straight wins to end the season and finish 11\u201371, which was the second-worst record in NBA history.\n \t\t\nDallas selected [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] forward [[Jamal Mashburn]] with the fourth overall pick of the [[1993 NBA draft]] and hired [[Quinn Buckner]] as coach.  Part of the problem was that Buckner decided from the start to be a disciplinarian on the model of his college coach, [[Bobby Knight]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} The mostly young roster did not respond very well to Buckner's stern coaching style and started 1\u201323. By the end of January, they were 3\u201340, and it was once again possible that they could tie the 1973 Sixers for the all-time worst record in the league. But 5\u20139 records in February and April, coupled with Buckner loosening the reins a little bit, helped the Mavs finish 13\u201369. It was still by far the worst record in the league, but the Mavericks again avoided setting an all-time futility record. They did, however, tie the NBA's ''single-season'' record for consecutive losses at [[List of National Basketball Association longest losing streaks|20 games]] (since broken).\n \t\t\nBuckner was fired after garnering the worst full-season record for a rookie head coach\u2014a record that only lasted four years, until [[Bill Hanzlik]] broke it with the [[Denver Nuggets]]. The Mavericks brought back Dick Motta, who had led the franchise to some of its most successful seasons. The Mavericks also wound up with the number two pick in the [[1994 NBA draft]], and picked up [[California Golden Bears men's basketball|Cal]] point guard [[Jason Kidd]], giving them a solid tandem of Jackson, Mashburn and Kidd which would become known as \"The Three Js\".\n\n====1994\u20131996: Arrival of Jason Kidd====\nThe addition of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with new life in [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395]]. Kidd averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists in his rookie season, and led the league in triple-doubles. [[Roy Tarpley]] was allowed to return to the league after three years and helped with 12.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. The tandem of Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn combined as the league's highest-scoring pair of teammates. On separate occasions, Mashburn and Jackson scored 50 points in a game that season. Mashburn contributed 24.1 points per game, fifth in the NBA; Jackson averaged 25.7 points but suffered a severe ankle sprain in February which caused him to miss the remainder of the regular season. Second-year forward [[Popeye Jones]] had a great year as well, as he averaged 10.6 rebounds and led the NBA in offensive rebounds.\n \t\t\nThe Mavericks' improvement was dramatic. They jumped to 36\u201346, 10th in the Western Conference and only five games behind the [[1994\u201395 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] for the eighth and final playoff spot. It was the biggest one-year improvement in the team's history and the highest in the NBA that season. Many{{Who|date=December 2014}} expected the Mavericks' improvement to continue with the franchise's first foray into the NBA Playoffs since 1990. But despite a 4\u20130 start, the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]] was a disappointment in about every conceivable way.{{According to whom|date=December 2014}} For the second time in his career, Roy Tarpley was given a lifelong ban from the NBA for repeated violations of the anti-drug policy\u2014he never played in the NBA again. Jamal Mashburn had season-ending surgery to repair his sore right knee only 18 games into the Mavericks' schedule.\n \t\t\nThe team's two remaining stars, Jason Kidd and Jim Jackson, bickered throughout the season, though neither of them had any trouble establishing his individual stardom. Jackson led the team in scoring with 19.6 ppg, made 121 three-pointers and was the only Mav to start in all 82 games. Kidd became the first Maverick to be elected a starter in the NBA All-Star Game and finished second in the league in assists and fourth in steals while averaging 16.6 ppg. [[George McCloud]], who averaged 9.6 ppg in his previous year, blew away his career-high scoring average as the Mavs resorted to the outside shot time and again due to their lack of an inside scoring threat. McCloud averaged 18.9 ppg and made 257 three-pointers, equaling the second-highest individual season total in league history.\n\nOverall, the Mavericks connected on 735 of their 2,039 three-point attempts, both new league records. The Mavs finished 26\u201356, fifth in the Midwest Division and 33 games out of first place. At season's end, Motta was relieved of his head coaching responsibilities and replaced by former Bulls assistant coach [[Jim Cleamons]]. And Don Carter, the only owner the Mavericks had ever had, sold the team to a group of investors led by [[H. Ross Perot, Jr.]]\n\n====1996\u20131998====\nThe [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]] was a year of transition for the Mavericks, as they basically re-designed their entire team; 27 different players saw action for that Dallas team, setting an all-time NBA record. By the time the season was over, only rookie forward [[Samaki Walker]] remained from the opening-day roster. The first big move came in December, as Jason Kidd, [[Loren Meyer]] and [[Tony Dumas]] were traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for guards [[Michael Finley]] and [[Sam Cassell]] and forward [[A. C. Green]]. By far the most important of these acquisitions{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} was Finley who, after his first half-season in Dallas, went on to average over or near 20 ppg for at least the next seven years of his Mavericks career. He made two visits to the NBA All-Star Game and played in each of the Mavs' games until the 2004\u201305 season.\n \t\t\n[[Don Nelson]] was hired as Dallas' general manager on February 7. Within a week of his hiring, the Mavs had released [[Fred Roberts]] and [[Oliver Miller]] and traded Jamal Mashburn to the [[Miami Heat]] for forwards [[Kurt Thomas (basketball)|Kurt Thomas]] and [[Martin M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp]] and guard [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107|Sasha Danilovi\u0107]]. Thomas did not play in 1996\u201397, and only ended up playing in five games as a Maverick before signing as a free agent with the [[New York Knicks]]. Danilovi\u0107 played in 13 games for the Mavs before opting out of his contract and signing with Bucker Bologna of the Italian League, and M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp played in 73 games for the Mavericks over the next two years before leaving the NBA.\n \t\t\n[[Chris Gatling]] was the Mavericks' sole representative in the NBA All-Star Game, but he did not last much longer in Dallas. In one of the largest two-team trades in NBA history, the Mavericks traded Gatling, Jim Jackson, Sam Cassell, George McCloud and [[Eric Montross]] to the [[New Jersey Nets]] for 7&nbsp;ft 6 in center [[Shawn Bradley]], forward [[Ed O'Bannon]] and guards [[Khalid Reeves]] and [[Robert Pack (basketball)|Robert Pack]]. Nelson claimed the trades were necessary because the situation in the locker room was unacceptable. However, whereas Cassell went on to become a consistent floor leader and Jackson, Gatling and McCloud all continued to be solid contributors to their teams for several more years, only Bradley lasted any sort of time in Dallas and would spend part of the next eight years putting up modest contributions for the Mavs and giving them solid numbers in terms of blocked shots.\n\nUndrafted rookie guard [[Erick Strickland]] averaged 10.6 ppg. He, along with Finley and Bradley, was expected to be the core of this new Mavericks team. The constant changes made it impossible to establish any sort of team chemistry in 1996\u201397, and the Mavericks finished 24\u201358. But they had acquired some of the pieces that would help them start to turn things around in years to come. In 1997\u201398, despite a poor record of 20\u201362, Dallas had a knack for giving some of the NBA's elite teams a hard time, as they beat the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], [[New York Knicks]], [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[Chicago Bulls]]. Against the Bulls, Dallas went on a 17\u20132 run to force overtime, where they won 104\u201397.  Midway through that season, Nelson fired Cleamons and named himself head coach.\n\n===1998\u20132019: The Dirk Nowitzki era===\n====1998\u20132001: New beginnings====\n[[File:Dirk Nowitzki 2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Dirk Nowitzki was acquired by the Mavericks from the Milwaukee Bucks in 1998 and would become the face of the franchise in later years.]]\nIn the [[1998\u201399 NBA lockout|lockout-shortened]] [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399]] season, the Mavericks finished with a lowly 19\u201331 record, but Michael Finley and [[Gary Trent]] put up solid numbers and led their team to their first winning home record (15\u201310) since 1989\u201390. Notable were the acquisitions of power forward [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and point guard [[Steve Nash]], two seemingly unspectacular moves which would make a great impact in the future. In the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|following season]] the [[1999\u20132000 Dallas Mavericks season|team]] finally \"clicked\" and started to win on a consistent basis. Led by Finley, the Mavericks earned their first 40-win season since 1989\u201390. He was greatly helped by Nowitzki, who finally \"arrived\" in the NBA and established himself as a potent offensive threat.\n\nOn January 14, 2000, Ross Perot's group sold the Dallas Mavericks to Internet entrepreneur and season ticket-holder [[Mark Cuban]] for $285&nbsp;million. Cuban immediately set out to revitalize the Mavericks and increase the team's popularity in Dallas and nationwide. His controversial moves (he allowed [[Dennis Rodman]] to live in his house for a week before temporarily signing him) and outspoken personality quickly made him a fan favorite in Dallas and garnered the team lots of press in the national media. He has also been fined millions of dollars for violating NBA rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/dallas/nba/story/_/id/10315836/mark-cuban-wish-granted-one-last-fine-david-stern-retires|title=Mark Cuban's wish granted with one last fine before David Stern retires|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n \t\t\nIn [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]], the Mavericks improved further and finished with a 53\u201329 record, fueled by an offensive triangle of Nowitzki, Finley and Nash. The Mavs made a trade minutes before the trade deadline that sent [[Hubert Davis]], [[Christian Laettner]], [[Courtney Alexander]], [[Loy Vaught]], and [[Etan Thomas]] to the [[Washington Wizards]] for [[Juwan Howard]], [[Calvin Booth]] and [[Obinna Ekezie]]. This move brought in fresh blood that secured the club's first playoff visit in 11 years. Also, [[Wang Zhizhi]] became the first Chinese player to play in the NBA, signing with the Mavs in January, along with the Eduardo N\u00e1jera, bringing Dallas an international cast that included Canada's Nash and Germany's Nowitzki. In the [[2001 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], the Mavericks won in the first round against the [[Utah Jazz]], advancing to the second round for the first time since 1988. Even though they were eliminated by the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in five games, it marked a sense of optimism for Dallas in seriously contending for an NBA title. This was also the last season in the old [[Reunion Arena]] before making the move to the modern [[American Airlines Center]].\n[[File:Victory Plaza 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Mavericks began playing at the [[American Airlines Center]] in 2001.]]\n\n====2001\u20132005: Run and Gun Nellie Ball====\nThe [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]] was a great season for the Mavericks, with a 57\u201325 record and many sellout crowds in the [[American Airlines Center]]. This season also saw a change in logo and colors, changing from the cowboy hat logo and green to a new horse logo. In addition, the team gained sleeker uniforms. Another blockbuster trade sent [[Juwan Howard]], [[Tim Hardaway]] and [[Donnell Harvey]] to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for [[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Nick Van Exel]], [[Tariq Abdul-Wahad]] and [[Avery Johnson]], the Mavericks also made several attempts to sign the [[Utah Jazz]]'s star [[Karl Malone]]. The Mavericks swept the [[Kevin Garnett]]-led [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] [[2002 NBA Playoffs|in the playoffs]] but lost again in the second round, this time to the [[Chris Webber]]-led [[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]].\n\nBut it was only in the next season that the Mavericks finally broke through. They started the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]] with a 14\u20130 record, which was one win shy of tying the NBA record set by the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394]] [[1993\u201394 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]] (15\u20130). The Mavericks finished with a 60\u201322 record in the regular season, astonishing fans and critics with their sparkling offense. Since acquiring the  \"Big Three\" of Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash, the Mavericks were a Western Conference power in waiting<ref>{{cite news|title=Worst to First|url=http://www.nba.com/features/mavericks_timeline_030408.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=April 9, 2003|accessdate=June 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618031126/http://www.nba.com/features/mavericks_timeline_030408.html|archive-date=June 18, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> and finally led the team to the Conference Finals against the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. However, with the series tied 1\u20131, Dirk Nowitzki, the team's leading scorer, suffered a knee injury in game three that kept him out the rest of the series. This further worsened the Mavs' front-court depth problems (both of their backup centers were injured for the entire series) and the Spurs took the series in 6 games.\n\nIn [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]], two blockbuster trades were announced. The Mavericks acquired [[Antawn Jamison]], [[Danny Fortson]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch]] and [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]] from [[Golden State Warriors|Golden State]] in exchange for Nick Van Exel, [[Evan Eschmeyer]], Popeye Jones, [[Avery Johnson]] and [[Antoine Rigaudeau]]. Another high-profile trade sent Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills and Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch to Boston for [[Antoine Walker]] and [[Tony Delk]]. Although the team struggled with chemistry, the Mavericks easily qualified for the playoffs. With the trio Nowitzki-Finley-Nash and [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year]] Jamison, the Mavericks continued their reputation as the best offensive team in the NBA. Notable were two rookies, [[Josh Howard]] and [[Marquis Daniels]], who made an immediate impact. However, the Mavericks were eliminated quickly [[2004 NBA Playoffs|in the playoffs]], losing in the first round to the [[Chris Webber]]-led [[Sacramento Kings]], a team which clearly played better defense. The Mavericks management had to re-evaluate their strategy.\n\nThe [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] saw trades which (among others) brought in burly center [[Erick Dampier]], combo guard [[Jason Terry]], speedy rookie point guard [[Devin Harris]], scoring machine [[Jerry Stackhouse]], and defensive stalwart [[Alan Henderson]]. Although the loss of All-Star Steve Nash via free agency visibly hurt the Mavericks' offense, the new acquisitions strengthened the team defense. The run-and-gun style of former times changed into a more balanced style of play. At the All-Star break, the Mavericks acquired [[Keith Van Horn]] for Calvin Booth and Henderson, the latter resigning only days later. Nowitzki added his third consecutive Euroscar during this season as well. On March 19, longtime coach Don Nelson resigned and his assistant Avery Johnson succeeded him. Under Johnson's tutelage, the defense of the Mavericks became stronger and they easily qualified for [[2005 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] with an impressive 58\u201324 record. The Mavericks defeated the [[Houston Rockets]] in Round 1 of the playoffs in 7 games but then lost to the [[Phoenix Suns]] 4\u20132, led by former Maverick star [[Steve Nash]].\n\n====2005\u20132006: First Finals appearance====\n{{Main|2005\u201306 Dallas Mavericks season}}\nPrior to the [[2005 NBA draft]], the Mavericks had traded all their picks away and were left empty-handed. On August 15, 2005, veteran guard Michael Finley was waived under the new \"Allan Houston Rule\".<ref>[http://www.dallasbasketball.com/morestories.asp?id=3286&NAV=1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920153034/http://www.dallasbasketball.com/morestories.asp?id=3286&NAV=1|date=September 20, 2014}}</ref> Under that rule, the [[Orlando Magic]] waived [[Doug Christie (basketball)|Doug Christie]], who then signed with the Mavericks. On August 19, the Mavericks held a press conference announcing they had re-signed [[Darrell Armstrong]], and introduced Christie, [[DeSagana Diop]], [[Rawle Marshall]], and [[Josh Powell]] as new Mavericks. Christie's playing time was very limited amid a surgically repaired ankle still hampering his play. He was waived on November 25, 2005. At the end of calendar 2005, Nowitzki achieved a rare double by winning both the Euroscar and [[Mr. Europa]], a second prestigious award for the top European player. He additionally was named the inaugural [[FIBA Europe Player of the Year Award|FIBA Europe Player of the Year]].\n\nUp until the very end of the season, the Mavericks were toe-to-toe with the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for the crown of the Southwest Division as well as the #1 spot in the Western Conference. However, they fell short of the title and had to settle for a fourth seed. Nonetheless, they once again achieved a 60\u201322 record, with [[Avery Johnson]] winning [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|NBA Coach of the Year]] honors. [[2006 NBA Playoffs|In the playoffs]], they swept the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], leading to a titanic series against their state rivals and the reigning NBA champions the San Antonio Spurs. Five out of the seven games were decided in the last minute, including a Game 7 that had to go into overtime, with the Mavs prevailing under the guidance of [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and an incredibly deep bench. The Mavericks were able to advance to the Conference Finals against former teammate [[Steve Nash]] and the [[Phoenix Suns]]. The Mavs' defense and depth enabled them to take the series, as they defeated the [[Phoenix Suns]] in game 6 of the Western Conference Finals on June 3, 2006, in the [[US Airways Center]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and the Mavs advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history.\n\n{{Main|2006 NBA Finals}}\nIn the NBA Finals, the Mavericks faced the [[2005\u201306 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], held home-court advantage and scored two convincing wins. After game 2, Dallas city officials had already planned the victory parade. However, in Game 3, the Mavs blew a late double-digit lead, courtesy of Heat guard [[Dwyane Wade]]. He carried the Heat to the win, with Nowitzki missing a potentially game-tying free throw in the last seconds. After getting blown out in Game 4, the Mavericks suffered another loss in Game 5 when Wade scored the game-tying basket in the last possession of regular time, putting the Heat ahead with last-second free throws in overtime. The [[tragic flaw|tragic figure]] was [[Josh Howard]], who missed a pair of clutch free throws in overtime and mistakenly called an early timeout, so the Mavs had to bring in the ball at backcourt rather than half-court for the last possession. In Game 6, the Mavericks took an early double-digit lead, but again, Wade poured in 36 points, helped by [[Alonzo Mourning]]'s five blocked shots, and the Mavericks lost their fourth game and the title after a string of botched three-pointers. Many Mavericks fans were stunned by the defeat. Mavericks owner [[Mark Cuban]] was fined a total of $250,000 for \"several acts of misconduct\" during the series, and Nowitzki was fined $5,000 for kicking a ball into the stands after Game 5.  Nowitzki was also caught by TV cameras attacking a stationary bicycle in the hallway outside of the Mavericks locker room. [[Jerry Stackhouse]] was suspended for Game 5 after fouling [[Shaquille O'Neal]] on a breakaway dunk attempt.  The latter marked the third time a Mavericks player was suspended in the 2006 playoffs.\n\nThe Mavericks became only the third team in NBA history (the first since 1977) to lose in the Finals after taking a 2\u20130 lead. In Game 3, the Mavs held a 13-point lead with under seven minutes remaining but were outscored 22\u20137 in the momentum-changing 98\u201396 defeat. The Heat's performance in the last seven minutes represented the team's greatest postseason comeback in team history.<ref>{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Brad|title=NBA.com: A Total Turnaround|url=http://www.nba.com/finals2006/heat_060620.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=June 20, 2006|accessdate=August 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017120059/http://www.nba.com/finals2006/heat_060620.html|archive-date=October 17, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====2006\u20132007: Nowitzki wins MVP====\nAfter an end to their playoff run in 2006, the Mavericks sought retribution in the new season. After a 0\u20134 start, the Mavericks went on a historic run and posted a 52\u20135 record over their next 57 games. They finished the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|regular season]] with a record of 67\u201315, good enough to be tied for 6th place all-time, first in the league and the number 1 seed in the [[2007 NBA Playoffs|Western Conference playoffs]]. [[Dirk Nowitzki]] had a dominant season, further cementing his place as one of the game's elite players; he won his fifth consecutive Euroscar during the season and was named the NBA MVP at its end. [[Josh Howard]] was named to the all-star team.\n\nHowever, the first-place Mavericks were defeated in six games by the 8th-seeded [[2006\u201307 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]]; this outcome was regarded by some as one of the biggest upsets in NBA history, while others did not consider it an upset at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/playoffs2007/news/billrussell_postseason.html#070501|title=NBA.com: NBA.com Blog: Bill Russell|accessdate=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/658m3e5kU?url=http://www.nba.com/playoffs2007/news/billrussell_postseason.html#070501|archive-date=February 2, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Mavs were exposed defensively, and the Warriors systematically dismantled the Mavericks by exploiting match-ups and preying on Dirk Nowitzki's weaknesses. On the year, the Mavericks went 67\u201312 against the rest of the league and 0\u20133 against Golden State. The Warriors were coached by [[Don Nelson]], the immediate past manager and coach of the Mavericks until he stepped down at the end of the 2005\u201306 season, and he had been appointed head coach of the Warriors in the 2006\u201307 mid-season.\n\nNowitzki's winning of regular season MVP honors and his team's first-round exit created an awkward dilemma regarding the MVP trophy ceremony.  Traditionally, the MVP award is given to the winner in a ceremony between the first and second rounds of the playoffs.  But it has been believed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2866994|title=Mavs' Nowitzki will receive MVP trophy next week|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> that the league opted to put some distance between the MVP presentation and the Mavericks' elimination against the Warriors. By the time Nowitzki collected his MVP award, nearly two weeks had elapsed since the Mavs were ousted in the playoffs.\n\n====2007\u20132008: The return of Jason Kidd====\n{{Main|2007\u201308 Dallas Mavericks season}}\n[[File: Jason Kidd drives Feb 24 2008.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Kidd drives to the basket during a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.]]\nThe Mavericks dealt [[Devin Harris]], two first-round picks and others to the [[New Jersey Nets]] for veteran all-star [[Jason Kidd]] and other role players, Cuban also tried to sign the free agent [[Kevin Garnett]] unsuccessfully. The Mavericks were 3\u201311 against winning teams since the trade and lost Nowitzki for a little over a week due to a high ankle sprain injury. He returned April 2 in a crucial game against the [[2008\u201309 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] in a 111\u201386 Mavericks victory and helped defeat the [[2008\u201309 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in a 105\u201398 win on April 6. This win in Phoenix was especially significant because the Mavs had been nearly unable to defeat a contending team on the road the entire season. Continuing their playoff push, Dirk hit a crucial three-pointer with 0.9 seconds left, defeating the [[2008\u201309 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]] 97\u201394 on April 10. This victory guaranteed them a playoff spot and their 8th consecutive 50-win season. The Mavericks ended the season with a record of 51\u201331. In the first round of the playoffs, the Mavericks were eliminated once again, by the New Orleans Hornets 4\u20131 on the road, 99\u201394.\n\nJust one day after a disappointing season ended, Avery Johnson was dismissed as Head Coach of the Dallas Mavericks.

But a run of 5\u20131 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. [[Dirk Nowitzki]] also entered the postseason with a streak of twenty-five consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in the first game of the quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, [[2008\u201309 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nThe Mavericks surprised many people by winning Game 1, 105\u201397 in San Antonio.<ref>The Examiner, April 19, 2009, Home teams lose 3 of 4 in Playoff openers, www.examiner.com/article/home-teams-lose-3-of-4-playoff-openers</ref> The Spurs quickly won game two in a rout. As the series shifted to Dallas, who had only lost one game there after the All-Star Break, won both Games 3 and 4. San Antonio was just trying to win Game 5 to extend the series, but they could not do it as the Mavericks closed out the series with a 13-point-victory, 106\u201393. With the Victory, the Mavericks advanced to the Conference semi-finals for the first time since 2006.\n\nIn the semi-finals, they faced the two-seeded [[2008\u201309 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]], who were fresh off a 4\u20131 series win against the [[2008\u201309 New Orleans Hornets season|New Orleans Hornets]], including a 58-point win in New Orleans. The Mavericks stayed close with the Nuggets in the first three-quarters of Games 1 and 2, but it was the fourth quarter when [[Carmelo Anthony]] and the Nuggets woke up, as they took the first two games by double-digit figures. Game 3 in Dallas was close the whole way, and Dallas led by five points with less than a minute to go. But Carmelo Anthony hit a three-pointer to give the Nuggets a 106\u2013105 victory. The play generated quite a bit of controversy because Maverick guard Antoine Wright clearly fouled Anthony, but since there was no replay used in the NBA in 2009 the Mavericks suffered a game 3 loss. It was later announced by the league that the referees made the wrong call,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2009/news/story?id=4155285|title=NBA admits referees' error cost the Dallas Mavericks in the final seconds|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> but despite that, the Mavericks still faced a 3\u20130 deficit in the series.\n\nNowitzki's 44 points in Game 4 saved the Mavericks season, sending the series back to Denver for a Game 5, with the series in Denver's favor, 3\u20131. Game 5 would prove to be the final game for the Mavericks of the 2009 season, as they would be ousted by a score of 124\u2013110. The elimination led to an off-season facing many questions about the future construction of the team.\n\nAfter a disappointing loss to the Nuggets in the playoffs, the Mavericks entered the off-season with many questions about the future construction of the team. They began by re-signing [[Jason Kidd]] to a three-year contract extension, which took care of their pending point guard issue. The Mavericks also made a move to compound their age problem, by trading for former All-Star small forward [[Shawn Marion]]. In a three-team deal with the Grizzlies and Raptors, the Mavericks sent swing-man Antoine Wright along with defensive stalwart Devean George to Toronto, while aging guard Jerry Stackhouse landed in Memphis. Dallas also acquired burly center [[Nathan Jawai]] and power forward [[Kris Humphries]]. Many analysts viewed this as a beneficial trade for the Mavericks, given that it countered their age issues while also providing them with more depth on the bench.<ref>Kelly Dwyer, \"What grabbing Shawn Marion means to Dallas\", Ball Don't Lie, Yahoo! Sports, July 7, 2009, https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/What-grabbing-Shawn-Marion-means-to-Dallas?urn=nba,175211</ref> The Mavericks also added veteran forwards [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]], [[Drew Gooden]], and [[Quinton Ross]].\n\n[[File:Jason Terry.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jason Terry spent eight years with the Mavericks, playing both of the teams' NBA Finals.]]\nThese moves proved successful, because after dropping the season opener to the [[2009\u201310 Washington Wizards season|Wizards]], the Mavericks went on to beat many contenders such as the [[2009\u201310 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]], [[2009\u201310 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]], [[2009\u201310 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]], and the [[2009\u201310 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]].\n\nA day before the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a deal. The trade sent [[Josh Howard]], [[James Singleton (basketball)|James Singleton]], and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in exchange for [[Caron Butler]], [[Brendan Haywood]], and [[Deshawn Stevenson]]. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Some NBA analysts felt that this was a good move, because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast, with many believing that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through.<ref>Marc Stein, \"Butler to Mavs, Wiz get Howard\", ESPN, February 14, 2010, http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nba/news/story?id=4912262</ref><ref>Christopher Reina, \"Grading The Deal: Mavs Become Title Contenders With Butler, Haywood\", RealGM Basketball, February 13, 2010, http://basketball.realgm.com/article/209154/Grading-The-Deal-Mavs-Become-Title-Contenders-With-Butler-Haywood</ref> The trade clearly worked, because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128\u201378. This was the third largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] 83\u201377. The Mavericks finished the season with a 55\u201327 record, good enough for the second seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks then entered the post-season with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could seriously contend for a title.\n\nDuring the playoffs though, this optimism proved to be short lived, because after winning game one 100\u201394, behind Nowitzki's 36-point performance, the Mavericks dropped the next three games to their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, before winning game five. Dallas would eventually lose against San Antonio in six games 97\u201387, leading to yet another off-season full of speculation, mostly centering on franchise player Dirk Nowitzki's pending free agent status.\n\n====2010\u20132011: Championship season====\n\n{{see also|2011 NBA Finals}}\n[[File:Mark Cuban at the Championship parade.jpg|thumb|right|Mavericks owner [[Mark Cuban]] holding the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]] during the championship parade.]]\nAfter yet another first round exit, the Mavericks began an unexpectedly early off-season. The first order of business for [[Mark Cuban]] and the Mavericks was to re-sign [[Dirk Nowitzki]], and they did so on July 4, 2010, when the Mavericks and Nowitzki agreed to a four-year deal worth $80&nbsp;million. On July 13, the Mavericks, after losing the opportunity to sign [[LeBron James]], [[Dwyane Wade]], or [[Amar'e Stoudemire]], acquired centers [[Tyson Chandler]] and [[Alexis Ajinca]] from the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] for center [[Erick Dampier]], forward [[Eduardo N\u00e1jera]] and guard [[Matt Carroll (basketball)|Matt Carroll]]. According to ''[[USA Today]]'', this trade was one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history; Chandler \"was the perfect fit during his first season with the Mavericks, anchoring their defense on the way to the franchise's first championship.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/02/16/most-one-sided-trades-nba-history-kobe-bryant-vlade-divac/80398520/|title=The most lopsided trades in NBA history|website=USA Today}}</ref>\n\nThe 2010\u201311 campaign saw the Mavericks fly out of the gate, winning 24 out of their first 29 games. However, on December 27, Dirk Nowitzki sustained a knee injury that derailed the Mavericks momentum, combined with the team's second-leading scorer [[Caron Butler]] suffering a season-ending knee injury himself only four nights later, raising questions of if the Mavericks could make it 11 straight 50-win seasons. The Mavericks then went on to drop seven of their next nine games, causing serious concern as to who would lead the offense in Nowitzki's absence. This however would prove to only be a temporary setback because Nowitzki only missed nine games, and admittedly rushed back to assist the Mavericks' reeling offense and consequently they quickly returned to their winning ways. The Mavericks re-invented their defensive reputation around the league during the 2010\u201311 campaign, mostly in part to off-season acquisition Tyson Chandler (who was later named to the All-Defensive Second Team).<ref>Jeff Caplan, \"Dirk: Chandler helps Mavs D\", ESPN Dallas, http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nba/news/story?id=5939497</ref> The Mavericks battled the San Antonio Spurs all season long for the division title, but instead settled for the 3rd seed, with a 57\u201325 record. However, due to the Mavericks bad reputation on struggling during the playoffs, many predicted them to be ousted in the first round against the six-seeded [[Portland Trail Blazers]].<ref>\"Expert Picks\", 2011 NBA Playoffs \u2013 First Round \u2013 Trailblazers vs. Mavericks \u2013 ESPN, http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2011/matchup/_/teams/trailblazers-mavericks</ref> Yahoo! Sports analyst [[Adrian Wojnarowski]] even went so far as to predict a sweep for the Trail Blazers.\n\nThe Mavs won games 1 and 2 on their home floor in convincing fashion. However, upon their arrival to the Rose Garden in Portland, problems began to arise. After dropping game three to Portland, the Mavericks blew a 23-point fourth-quarter lead in game four to allow Portland to tie the series at two games apiece. The whispers then began to re-surface that the Mavericks were going to allow another impressive regular season to go down the drain.<ref>Jason Quick, \"Trail Blazers-Mavericks: Game 5 will reveal psychological impact of dramatic Portland comeback\", Oregon Live, April 24, 2011, http://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/index.ssf/2011/04/trail_blazers-mavericks_game_5.html</ref> The Mavericks then responded, posting back-to-back wins to oust the Blazers in six games. They then met the two-time defending champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in the Western Conference Semi-finals. This series was the first time that [[Kobe Bryant]] had met Dirk Nowitzki in a playoff series and was expected to be extremely competitive; that however did not prove to be the case. The Mavericks shocked the NBA world by winning the first two games in Los Angeles, and took a two games to none lead heading back to Dallas. They then won a thrilling game three in Dallas, courtesy of 32 points from Nowitzki in a 98\u201392 victory. The Mavericks then provided the perfect \"exclamation point\",<ref>Robert Dougherty, \"Lakers Vs. Mavericks Game 4 Decisively Ends L.A. Dynasty\", Yahoo!

In that game, Jason Terry set an NBA playoff record with nine three-pointers with just one miss, ousting the Lakers in a four-game sweep. The Mavericks then met the upstart [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the Western Conference Finals. Dirk Nowitzki set the tone in the series in game one with a 48-point performance, with the Mavericks taking game 1 by a score of 121\u2013112. The Thunder then responded with 106\u2013100 victory in game 2. The Mavericks then won the next three games, including a 15-point comeback in game 4, to take the series in five games. The Mavericks claimed their second Western Conference Championship in franchise history, and met the team that defeated them in the 2006 NBA Finals, the [[Miami Heat]].\n\nThe Mavs entered the 2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miami's \"Big Three\" coming together during the course of the 2010\u201311 NBA Playoffs. After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92\u201384, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88\u201373, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0\u20132 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22\u20135 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88\u201386. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112\u2013103, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105\u201395 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \"soft\", and putting an end to the Mavericks' post-season futility.\n\n====2011\u20132013: Post-championship struggles and later absence from playoffs====\nThe 2011\u201312 season was shortened to 66 games due to a [[2011 NBA lockout|lockout]], which meant the Mavericks had to wait until [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|Christmas Day]] to raise their first championship banner. During the brief off-season, owner Mark Cuban decided to maintain financial flexibility by letting Tyson Chandler, DeShawn Stevenson, J. J. Barea and Caron Butler go. Chandler signed with the [[New York Knicks]], Stevenson joined the [[New Jersey Nets]], Barea went to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]], and Butler joined the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. Meanwhile, they acquired incumbent [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award|NBA Sixth Man of the Year]] [[Lamar Odom]] via a trade with the Lakers, while signing veterans [[Vince Carter]] and [[Delonte West]].\n\nThe Mavericks raised their championship banner prior to their Finals rematch with the Heat on Christmas Day, but in what would soon become a mirror image of the [[2006\u201307 Miami Heat season|2006\u201307 Heat]]'s eventual failed title defense, Miami blew them out in a 105\u201394 loss, marking Dallas's first regular-season loss to Miami in eight seasons. Things did not get better for Dallas after starting the season 0\u20133, losing to the Thunder in a playoff rematch on December 29. As the calendar turned to 2012, the Mavericks won 13 of 18 games in January, but they posted a 22\u201322 record the rest of the way, eventually finishing 7th with a 36\u201330 record, their lowest finish since the 2007\u201308 season. Nowitzki produced 21.6 points, 6 rebounds and 45.7% shooting, his lowest numbers since the 2000\u201301 season. Meanwhile, Odom proved to be a bad fit for the Mavericks, and they decided to sit him out for the final two months of the season.\n\nIn a rematch from the previous year, the Mavericks faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the [[2012 NBA Playoffs]]. Games 1 and 2 went down the wire, but the Mavericks fell short on both occasions as Kevin Durant made a game-winning jumper in Game 1, and with late-game free throws in Game 2. Back in Dallas for Game 3, the Mavericks suffered a 95\u201379 defeat to fall behind 0\u20133. In Game 4, the Mavericks led for much of the second half, but [[James Harden]]'s 15-point fourth quarter rallied the Thunder to a 103\u201397 win and eliminated the Mavericks from contention. It marked the first time Dallas was swept in a seven-game series, and they became the third defending champion to be swept in the first round after the aforementioned 2006\u201307 Heat and the 1956\u201357 Philadelphia Warriors.\n\nDuring the 2012 off-season, the Mavericks lost both Jason Kidd and Jason Terry to free agency. Kidd signed with the New York Knicks, while Terry joined the [[Boston Celtics]]. Brendan Haywood was later amnestied before moving to the [[Charlotte Bobcats]]. The Mavericks acquired [[Darren Collison]] from the [[Indiana Pacers]] and signed [[O. J. Mayo]] from the [[Memphis Grizzlies]]. Also joining the team were former All-Stars [[Chris Kaman]] and [[Elton Brand]].\n\nThe [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]] was a struggle for the Mavericks, as Nowitzki recovered from knee surgery and missed 29 games. In addition, Collison was inexperienced at the point, leading the Mavericks to sign veteran [[Derek Fisher]] for nine games,<ref>Sefko, Eddie, \"Mavericks to sign veteran point guard Derek Fisher on Thursday\", SportsDayDFW, Dallas Morning News, November 28, 2013 [http://mavsblog.dallasnews.com/2012/11/mavericks-to-sign-veteran-point-guard-derek-fisher-on-thursday.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031060220/http://mavsblog.dallasnews.com/2012/11/mavericks-to-sign-veteran-point-guard-derek-fisher-on-thursday.html/ |date=October 31, 2014 }}</ref> before settling on [[Mike James (basketball, born 1975)|Mike James]]. Mayo was the team's leading scorer for the first two months of the season before Nowitzki's return saw his averages dip. Kaman and Brand were also hounded by injuries. The Mavericks were 23\u201329 at the All-Star break, before making a late push for a playoff berth. Still, it did not save their season, and the Mavericks missed the playoffs for the first time since 2000.\n\n====2013\u20132016: Return to the playoffs====\nDuring the 2013 off-season, the Mavericks chose not to re-sign role players Collison, Brand, and Kaman. Mayo then declined to exercise his player option, and later signed with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. The Mavericks signed [[Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (basketball)|Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n]] from the [[Detroit Pistons]] and [[Monta Ellis]] from the Bucks. They also signed veteran [[Samuel Dalembert]].\n\nOn April 4, 2014, the Mavericks swept the season-series with the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time since the 1980\u201381 season with a 107\u201395 win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400490015|title=Dirk Nowitzki's 27 help Mavs beat 2nd L.A. team in as many nights|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Mavericks finished 49\u201333, one game ahead of Phoenix for the eighth and final playoff spot, which meant that they would once again have to face their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, who were the top seed in the Western Conference with a 62\u201320 record. In Game 1 in San Antonio, Dallas had an 81\u201371 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1, 85\u201390. However, the Mavs forced 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113\u201392, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108\u2013106 with 1.7 seconds left, but a buzzer-beater by [[Vince Carter]] gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2\u20131 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93\u201389 despite a late Dallas comeback after the Spurs at one point had a 20-point lead and later won Game 5 at home, 109\u2013103, giving them a 3\u20132 series lead. The Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111\u2013113. Game 7 was on the Spurs home court, and the Spurs beat the Mavericks 119\u201396, putting an end to the Mavericks' season.\n\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Mavericks made several moves, the first of which was trading for Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton from the New York Knicks, sending Calder\u00f3n, Dalembert, Shane Larkin, and Wayne Ellington as well as two-second-round draft picks, on June 26, 2014, right before the draft. Nowitzki also took a generous discount, re-signing for three years and $25&nbsp;million, which helped Dallas sign restricted free agent [[Chandler Parsons]] from the Houston Rockets to a three-year contract at $46&nbsp;million. Devin Harris was re-signed, for four years and $16&nbsp;million. Dallas brought in [[Richard Jefferson]], [[Al-Farouq Aminu]], [[Jameer Nelson]], [[Greg Smith (basketball, born 1991)|Greg Smith]] to build a deep bench. The Mavs' sixth man, Vince Carter, left in free agency to the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nOn November 13, 2014, the Mavericks recorded their largest  victory ever with a 123\u201370 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. The 53-point margin for Dallas surpassed its 50-point win over the New York Knicks in January 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20141113/PHIDAL/gameinfo.html|title=76ers at Mavericks|publisher=National Basketball Association|accessdate=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906114536/http://www.nba.com/games/20141113/PHIDAL/gameinfo.html|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Two days later, they scored 131 points to record their biggest point tally since 2009 in the win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20141115/MINDAL/gameinfo.html|title=Timberwolves at Mavericks|publisher=National Basketball Association|accessdate=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317214322/http://www.nba.com/games/20141115/MINDAL/gameinfo.html|archive-date=March 17, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn December 18, 2014, the Mavericks sent [[Jae Crowder]], Jameer Nelson, Brandan Wright, a 2015 first-round pick and a 2016 second-round pick to the [[Boston Celtics]] for [[Rajon Rondo]] and [[Dwight Powell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mavs.com/mavs-acquire-rajon-rondo-dwight-powell-from-celtics/|title=Mavs acquire four-time All-Star Rajon Rondo|work=mavs.com|date=December 18, 2014|accessdate=December 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219043216/http://www.mavs.com/mavs-acquire-rajon-rondo-dwight-powell-from-celtics/|archive-date=December 19, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn April 28, 2015, the Mavericks were knocked out of the first round by their in state rivals, the Houston Rockets, in a 4\u20131 series loss. After going down 3\u20130 in a Game 3 overtime, the Mavericks managed to win one on their homecourt before losing in Houston in the clinching game, 103\u201394. The Mavericks were the seventh seed in the playoffs and finished the season 50\u201332.\n\nOn April 25, 2016, the Mavericks were once again knocked out of the first round, this time by the Oklahoma City Thunder in a 4\u20131 series loss. After managing to win a game at OKC and tying the series 1\u20131, the Mavericks lost three straight to lose the series. This series was marked by physicality by both teams, including a Kevin Durant Flagrant 2 foul and several Mavericks playing very aggressive defense on Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.\n\n====2016\u20132019: Lottery return, Dirk's final years and Don\u010di\u0107 rookie season====\nThe Mavericks did not make the playoffs during the 2016\u201317 season, despite efforts from their newest additions, [[Seth Curry]], [[Harrison Barnes]], [[Nerlens Noel]], and [[Yogi Ferrell]]. They began the season going 3\u201315 through their first 18 games, and could not bounce back, finishing at a 33\u201349 record despite fighting towards a winning record, even reaching a 28\u201336 record partway through the season. This was the second time in 17 years they missed the playoffs, with the other being the 2012\u20132013 season. The season marked the first time the team finished with a losing record since the 1999\u20132000 season.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks received the ninth pick in the [[2017 NBA draft]] and used it to select point guard [[Dennis Smith Jr.]] out of [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|North Carolina State]]. They began the 2017\u201318 season 3\u201315 through their first eighteen games as in the year prior and concluded it on a 2\u201312 slump to finish with a 24\u201358 record despite a solid rookie season from Smith Jr., who averaged 15.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 5.2 assists over 69 games.

However, in the 1992\u201393 season, they went back to their original road uniform scheme from their expansion season, with minor alterations to the \"Dallas\" script, a design that the Mavericks used until 2001. From 1980 to 2001, the home white uniforms had \"Mavericks\" in blue, with green and white trim, with a few minor alterations to the \"Mavericks\" script during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportslogos.net/team.php?id=228 |title=Dallas Mavericks&nbsp;\u2013 Chris Creamer's Sports Logos Page |publisher=Sportslogos.net |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> The 1980s green road jerseys were revived in the 2004\u201305 season as part of the Mavericks' 25th anniversary.  However, while the lettering from the 1980s uniform was present, the number scheme resembled the 1993\u20132001 uniforms. The green uniforms would be revived again in the 2015\u201316 season, still with the 1990s number scheme.\n\n[[File:Dallas mavericks wordmark.gif|thumb|right|The Dallas Mavericks' wordmark logo.]]\nIn the [[2001\u201302 NBA season]], the Mavericks drastically updated their logos and uniforms, with a new [[Dallas Cowboys]]-inspired color scheme of midnight blue, royal blue and silver. The new uniforms consist of a \"Dallas\" script on both the home and road jerseys.  On the home jersey, \"Dallas\" is in midnight blue across the chest and the numbers are in royal blue with silver trim, while on the road jersey, \"Dallas\" is in white, with the numbers in silver and white trim.\n\nIn the [[2003\u201304 NBA season]], the Mavericks debuted their shiny silver alternate uniforms, with \"Mavericks\" in white and royal blue trim, with blue numerals. However, it proved to be unpopular with fans (thus derisively nicknamed the 'Trash Bags'), and it was scrapped after just one game (at [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] on October 28, 2003).\n\nIn the [[2004\u201305 NBA season]], the Mavericks introduced an alternate green uniform similar to their 1980s road uniforms. They were designed by rapper [[Sean Combs|Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs]], and featured \"Mavs\" in white on the front side of the jersey with blue trim, and the numbers in silver with white trim above the script on the left chest.\n\nOn September 21, 2009, the Mavericks unveiled a new alternate royal blue uniform with the same \"Mavs\" script, replacing the green uniform. The said uniform will also be used for the NBA's Noche Latina promotion, with the wordmark \"Los Mavs.\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Todd |url=http://mavsblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/09/mavericks-debut-a-new-alternate-jersey.html |title=Mavericks debut a new alternate jersey &#124; News for Dallas, Texas |work=The Dallas Morning News |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708222341/http://mavsblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/09/mavericks-debut-a-new-alternate-jersey.html |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn August 19, 2010, the Mavericks unveiled yet another change to their uniform set, with a new royal blue road uniform that displays the \"Dallas\" script in navy blue with silver numbers, both with white trim.

The uniform was selected among thousands of entries as part of a design-a-uniform contest the Mavericks initiated during the 2013\u201314 season, but was not worn until the 2015\u201316 season.\n\nWith the switch to [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] as the uniform supplier in 2017, the home and away uniform designations were eliminated. In its place are the \"Icon\" uniforms, \"Association\" uniforms, \"Statement\" uniforms and \"City\" uniforms. The Mavericks' white uniforms are part of the \"Association\" set, the royal blue uniforms are identified with the \"Icon\" set, and the navy blue uniforms are included in the \"Statement\" set.\n\nFor the \"City\" set, the Mavericks wore black uniforms with \"DAL\" and the numbers in royal blue with neon green trim (a nod to the original Mavericks' colors). This set was worn only during the 2017\u201318 season, after which a new \"City\" uniform would be designed. The new \"City\" uniform was unveiled in November 2018. The \"DAL\" across the chest was replaced with the team's secondary logo and the neon green trim was removed, with the numbers no longer having a trim color. The \"City\" uniform for the 2019\u201320 season featured a stylized \"MAVS\" wordmark inspired from [[graffiti]] paintings. The uniform base had a light blue/navy blue gradient and neon green trim.\n\nPrior to the 2019\u201320 season, the Mavericks drastically redesigned their navy \"Statement\" uniforms, eliminating the Dallas skyline and reverting to the full team name \"Mavericks\" in front. The uniform contains white lettering and white and royal blue side stripes.\n\n==Head coaches==\n{{Main|List of Dallas Mavericks head coaches}}\n[[File:Rick Carlisle.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Rick Carlisle]], head coach since 2008.]]\nThere have been nine&nbsp;[[head coach]]es for the Mavericks franchise.

First they came head to head in the [[2006 NBA Finals]], in which the two teams captured their first respective conference titles. The Mavericks came into the series 60\u201322 with a strong group of players while the Miami Heat came in with a respectable 52\u201330 record and sported an aging but still strong [[Shaquille O'Neal]] as well as an up-and-coming [[Dwyane Wade]]. Dallas was favored by many in the media to win the series. The Dallas Mavericks won the first two games but Miami went on to sweep the next four and win the NBA championship for the first time in team history.\n\nBoth teams saw success over the next few seasons and appeared in the playoffs multiple times, and would ultimately go on to have a rematch in the [[2011 NBA Finals]]. It was also the first time that either team had reached the Finals since 2006. This time, however, Miami was favored to win after a highly publicized event when Miami signed [[LeBron James]] and [[Chris Bosh]] to their roster. Dallas came in with a 57\u201325 record while the Heat came in 58\u201324. Miami won the first game 92\u201384, but Dallas went on to win four of the next five and upset the Heat to win the first title in franchise history.\n\n===San Antonio Spurs===\n{{main|Mavericks\u2013Spurs rivalry}}\n\nThe Mavericks-Spurs rivalry is relatively new but very fierce. It features two teams with Dallas roots\u2014the Spurs began their life in the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] as the Dallas Chaparrals and did not move to San Antonio until 1973. On October 11, 1980, the Mavs made their NBA debut by defeating the Spurs 103\u201392. The teams have met numerous times in the playoffs, with the Spurs defeating the Mavericks in 2001, 2003, 2010, and 2014, while the Mavericks defeated the Spurs in 2006 and 2009. The Spurs have won five championships and six conference titles, while the Mavericks have won one championship and two conference titles. The Spurs have won 15 division titles, while the Mavericks have won 3. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks have 3 60-win seasons. This is known as the \"I-35 rivalry\" because both cities lie on [[Interstate 35]].\n\nThe two teams met in the playoffs during the 2000\u20132001 season with the Spurs winning in five games. Little was made during this series, as the Spurs won their first NBA championship only two years before. The Mavericks, run by a trio of [[Steve Nash]], [[Michael Finley]], and [[Dirk Nowitzki]], had just defeated the [[Utah Jazz]] despite not having home court advantage and were only starting to meld into a title contender.\n\nThe two teams met again in 2003 in the Western Conference Finals. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks had 60-win seasons and reached the Western Conference Finals after defeating the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Sacramento Kings]], respectively. Despite having the best season of their history, the Mavericks fell in six games to the Spurs.\n\nThe rivalry took on a new meaning in 2005 when, near the end of the regular season, [[Don Nelson]] would resign as head coach of the Mavericks, apparently satisfied with the state of the team, and hand the coaching reins to former Spur [[Avery Johnson]], the [[point guard]] of the 1999 NBA champion Spurs team who hit the game-winning shot against the [[New York Knicks]]. Since Johnson was coached under Spurs' Head Coach [[Gregg Popovich]], he would be familiar with most, if not all, of Popovich's coaching style and philosophy. During the 2005 offseason, [[Michael Finley]], waived by the Mavericks under the amnesty clause, joined the Spurs in search for the elusive title.\n\nDuring the 2006 playoffs the two rivals met again. San Antonio won the first game at home 87\u201385. The Mavericks got revenge the next game, winning 113\u201391 and evening the series up at 1\u20131. The Mavericks then won a dramatic Game 3 by a single point, 104\u2013103. Though Manu Gin\u00f3bili could have made a game-winning basket with five seconds on the clock, he committed an error, allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly-contested Game 4 123\u2013118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]], who fouled Dirk on the play, had just given San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation, was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime. The Mavericks, meanwhile, were set to take control of the game and they did just that, winning 119\u2013111. The Mavericks went on to the Conference Finals where they defeated the Suns in six games, but succumbed to the champion Heat in the NBA Finals.\n\nDespite much anticipation of a renewed meeting in the 2007 Western Conference finals, the Mavericks lost to the Golden State Warriors in one of the greatest upsets in NBA history. The Spurs won the NBA finals after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10005744 |title=Dallas Mavericks Upset by Oakland Upstarts |publisher=NPR |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> The eighth seed Warriors, who made the playoffs on the last game of the NBA season, defeated the 67-win, first-seed Mavericks in six games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270503009 |title=ESPN&nbsp;\u2013 Dallas vs. Golden State Recap, May 3, 2007 |publisher=ESPN |date=May 3, 2007 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Spurs would ultimately go on to win the 2007 NBA Championship, establishing themselves as a true NBA dynasty.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=3281217&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 Sweep!

[[Joey Crawford]], the referee who ejected Duncan, allegedly asked Duncan to a fight which led to the longtime ref's season-ending suspension. As Duncan was heading into the locker room, [[American Airlines Center]] erupted into a huge cheer, applauding Duncan's ejection. The game saw chippy play, with [[Jerry Stackhouse]] and [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] getting into an altercation after a rebound.\n\nIn the 2009 NBA Playoffs, the Mavericks and Spurs squared off again in the first round.  The Spurs and Mavericks split the first two games in San Antonio, but Dallas defeated the Spurs in games 3 and 4, both in Dallas. The Mavericks then went on to close out the series and eliminated the Spurs at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.\n\nIn 2010, the Dallas Mavericks matched up against the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs. Although the Mavericks managed to obtain the number two seed, they were defeated by the Spurs in six games.\n\nDuring the 2011 playoffs, a role reversal of sorts occurred between the two rivals, when the top seeded Spurs were defeated by the eighth seeded [[Memphis Grizzlies]], the first time an eight seed defeated a one seed since the infamous Mavs-Warriors series of 2007.  In addition, the Mavericks defeated the LeBron James-led [[Miami Heat]] in the NBA Finals, similar again to how the 2007 Spurs defeated a LeBron James-led [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] team in the Finals.\n\nThe Mavericks were swept in the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]] by the Spurs for the first time since the [[1997\u20131998 NBA season|1998 season]], Tim Duncan's rookie season. In their last match up of the season, San Antonio escaped with a 92\u201391 victory over Dallas when a [[Vince Carter]] 3-point attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer. With the win the Spurs clinched a playoff spot for the 16th straight season, currently the longest streak in the NBA. San Antonio also reached 50 wins for the 14th straight season, the longest streak in NBA history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278687|title=Spurs edge Mavericks to sweep season series|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2013\u201314 season]], the Spurs once again swept the Mavs in the regular season, giving them nine straight victories. In addition, an overtime loss to the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] on April 16, 2014 ensured that the Mavericks would face the Spurs once again in the [[2014 NBA Playoffs]], where the Mavs would be the eighth seed and San Antonio the first. In Game 1 in San Antonio, the game was relatively close. Dallas managed to reach an 81\u201371 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1 at home, 85\u201390. However, the Mavs managed to force 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113\u201392, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] managed to hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108\u2013106 with 1.7 left, but a buzzer beater by [[Vince Carter]] gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2\u20131 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93\u201389 and later Game 5 at home 109\u2013103, giving them a 3\u20132 lead. Luckily, the Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111\u2013113. The Spurs won game 7 119\u201396, eliminating the Mavericks in the first round.\n\n===Phoenix Suns===\nDuring the 2004 off-season, former Dallas Mavericks point guard [[Steve Nash]] signed a free-agent deal with the 29\u201353 [[Phoenix Suns]] to help out their offense. The addition of Nash helped as Phoenix rolled to a 62\u201320 record and the best record in the NBA. The teams met in the Western Conference Semi-finals with Phoenix having the home-court advantage.\n\nPhoenix won Game One 127\u2013102 with a 40-point game by [[Amar'e Stoudemire]]. Steve Nash was also given his [[NBA MVP]] award during that game, a game in which he terrorized his former team. However, Mavericks star [[Dirk Nowitzki]] hit a game-winning turn-around jumper in Game 2 to beat Phoenix 108\u2013106 to send the series back to Dallas tied 1\u20131. Phoenix and Dallas split the two games in [[Dallas]] which saw both winners of games score 119 points. The series went back Phoenix then took care of Dallas 114\u2013108 in the [[America West Arena]] (now US Airways Center). Then, in Game Six, with Dallas facing elimination, Phoenix beat Dallas in a thriller which saw [[Steve Nash]] with a 39-point game, to go along with 12 assists. Phoenix then made it to the Western Conference Finals, where they eventually lost to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] who then went on to win the NBA Title that season.\n\nThe following year, a Suns team without Stoudemire (who was injured), [[Joe Johnson (basketball)|Joe Johnson]], and [[Quentin Richardson]], but with a core of new players led by [[Raja Bell]] (who clotheslined Lakers star [[Kobe Bryant]] in a first-round series game), [[Boris Diaw]] and [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]] to go along with Nash and fellow All-Star [[Shawn Marion]]. Phoenix had to play seven game series against the two Los Angeles teams, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] (who had a 3\u20131 lead against Phoenix) and the resurgent [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. They faced a Mavericks team who won 60 games, but were forced to be the fourth seed since the division winners got the top three seeds. On their way to the Western Conference Finals, Dallas swept the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], and beat in-state rival [[San Antonio Spurs]] in seven tense games. Phoenix won Game One 121\u2013118 after Diaw hit a game-winning shot in the dying seconds of the fourth quarter. Bell, though injured himself in Game One, missing Games Two and Three. After that, Dallas took control of the series, winning Games Two and Three by the scores of 105\u201398 and 95\u201388. Bell came back for Game Four and led Phoenix to a 106\u201386 blowout win. Dallas however, beat Phoenix 117\u2013101 in Game Five which included a 50-point performance from Dirk Nowitzki, and eliminated the Suns in Phoenix 102\u201393 in Game Six. Dallas would later on lose to the [[Miami Heat]] in six games, despite winning the first two games.\n\nOn March 14, 2007 in Dallas, Phoenix beat Dallas in a 129\u2013127 double overtime thriller. With the Mavericks up by 7 with a minute left in regulation, Dirk Nowitzki (a 90% free throw shooter) missed two free throws. Steve Nash fed off his mistakes and scored 10 straight points including the game-tying three-pointer with 3 seconds left to go. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-winning shot bounced off the rim and sent the game to overtime. [[Jason Terry]] sent the game into another overtime with a game-tying three-pointer of his own. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-tying shot in double overtime went in and out of the rim as Amar'e Stoudemire's 41 points were too much for Dallas to handle.\n\nOn April 10, 2013, the Mavericks 12-season playoff streak, since [[2000\u201301 Dallas Mavericks season|2001]], ended in a loss to the Suns 102\u201391.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278889|title=Mavs eliminated from playoff contention for first time since 2000|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn April 12, 2014 the Mavs handed the Suns one of three straight losses to keep them out of the playoffs, 101\u201398. The other losses from rival San Antonio and the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\n===Houston Rockets===\n{{main|Mavericks\u2013Rockets rivalry}}\n\nAn NBA intrastate rivalry, both in Texas linked by I-45, as well as both Dallas and Houston fans traditionally having a disdain for each other's city, the rivalry started when the Mavericks were the last Texas team to join the NBA. This is also known as the I-45 rivalry because they both lie on [[Interstate 45]]. In the Mavs' inaugural season in 1980\u201381, the Rockets won all six meetings including a 116\u201368 blowout win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198102040HOU.html|title=Dallas Mavericks at Houston Rockets Box Score, February 4, 1981|work=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> In the playoffs, the Mavericks defeated the Rockets in the 1988, and 2005 playoffs, the latter of which was plagued with allegations of game fixing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.chron.com/ultimaterockets/2008/06/donaghy-points-smoking-gun-at-rockets-series-misfires/|title=Donaghy points smoking gun at Rockets series, misfires|work=Ultimate Rockets|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> and the Rockets swept several season series with the Mavericks during the 1990s during the Rockets' championship years. On April 11, 1995 the Mavericks were able to get one of their most superb victories against the Houston reigning champion for 156\u2013147 scoring 23 points in the first overtime. Two years later, the Rockets and Mavericks have clashed in their first ever regular season's game played in [[Mexico City]] and won by the Rockets 108\u2013106. In recent years the rivalry has once again flourished with Dallas owner [[Mark Cuban]] and Rockets general manager [[Daryl Morey]] taking shots at each other on social media, as well as Houston fan favorite [[Chandler Parsons]] signing an offer sheet to leave the Rockets to sign with the rival Mavericks for $46&nbsp;million, while making negative statements about the city of Houston upon leaving,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://houston.cbslocal.com/2014/10/08/chandler-parsons-calls-houston-dirty/|title=Chandler Parsons Calls Houston \u2018Dirty\u2019|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> causing massive backlash among Rockets fans. Finally, longtime Mavericks' player [[Jason Terry]], who was a starter on the Mavs' 2011 championship team, joined the Rockets for the [[2014\u201315 NBA season|2015 season]], and both teams met in the first round of the [[2015 NBA Playoffs]], with the Rockets as the 2nd seed and Mavericks the 7th seed, and the Rockets got the best of them 4\u20131.\n\n===Los Angeles Lakers===\nThe rivalry between the Lakers and Mavericks began in the 1980s during the Lakers' [[Showtime (basketball)|Showtime era]]. In the [[1984 NBA Playoffs]], the Lakers won over the Mavericks in the Western Conference Semi-finals with the series 4\u20131. In 1986, they met again in the semi-finals and the Lakers won the series 4\u20132. In the [[1988 NBA Playoffs]], the Lakers, who were the defending champions, defeated the Mavericks in a seven-game series in the Western Conference Finals and eventually became the back-to-back champions after winning the [[1988 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. In 2011, the Mavericks met the two-time defending champions Lakers in the semi-finals and rejected their three-peat by sweeping them in four games and eventually won the [[2011 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. In Game 2 of the [[2011 NBA Playoffs]], [[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]] was ejected for hitting [[J. J. Barea]] and suspended for Game 3. In Game 4, [[Lamar Odom]] was ejected for pushing [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and then [[Andrew Bynum]] was ejected for elbowing [[J. J. Barea]]. Both players received flagrant foul 2. After the [[2011 NBA lockout]], Lamar Odom was sent to the Mavericks after he requested to leave the Lakers due to the vetoed Chris Paul trade. Andrew Bynum made a formal apology for what he did to Barea before the start of the following season.\n\n===Sacramento Kings===\nThe rivalry between the Kings and Mavericks could very well be traced to the similar styles of plays of [[Chris Webber]], [[Dirk Nowitzki]], [[Mike Bibby]], [[Steve Nash]], [[Peja Stojakovi\u0107]], and [[Michael Finley]] and the similar coaching styles of [[Rick Adelman]] and [[Don Nelson]]. In the [[2002 NBA Playoffs]] the Kings defeated the Mavericks four games to one in the semi-finals, in the [[2003 NBA Playoffs]] the table were turned and Mavericks defeated the Kings four games to three in the semi-finals. However, the tables were turned once more and in the [[2004 NBA Playoffs]] the Kings defeated the Mavericks once again four games to one in the quarterfinals. Since that time, free agency and trades would dull the rivalry and the teams have not met in the playoffs since.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n''List of the last five seasons completed by the Mavericks.
