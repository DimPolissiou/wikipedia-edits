This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head -- which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth, which remain exposed to outside (\"ambient\") air.

(Iron lungs must move larger quantities of air for every breath, because they must change the pressure of the air in the entire vessel, not just inflate the lungs).\n* Electrical power failure can result in prompt patient death. (Most iron lungs and similar devices lack backup power supplies. Manual power is an option on some units, but require multiple attendants, working alternately, to provide direct, continuous physical pumping of the iron lung's pump or diaphragm.)\n* Physical hazard to people and things in the immediate vicinity, because of exposed moving parts (Not true of all iron lungs).\n\n==Invention and early use==\n\n===Initial development===\n[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|Iron lung from the 1950s in the [[Stadtmuseum G\u00fctersloh|G\u00fctersloh Town Museum]].

In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head -- which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth, which remain exposed to outside (\"ambient\") air. A pump (typically a mechanically-powered diaphragm) momentarily reduces the air pressure inside the iron lung, to a pressure lower than outside (ambient) air.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nThis causes the air within the iron lung, but outside the chest wall, to be at a lower pressure than the air inside the patient's lungs (thus, the term \"negative pressure\"), so the patient's lungs and chest expand to equalize their air pressure to the lower pressure of the interior of the iron lung.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nNow, the expanded lungs are at a lower pressure than the \"ambient\" air outside the iron lung.  As a result, outside (ambient) air forces its way in through the patient's exposed nose and mouth, into their airway, to fill the lower-pressure space inside the patient's lungs -- and the patient has thus \"taken a breath\" (\"inhaled\").<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nExhaling is stimulated by allowing the pressure inside the iron lung to return to normal, matching the outside (ambient) air pressure.  As a result, the patient's chest is no longer being expanded by negative pressure, and the natural elasticity of the patient's chest causes it to collapse, squeezing air from the patient's lungs, through the patient's airway, and out of their exposed mouth and nose -- and the patient has thus \"exhaled.\"<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nThe process continues cycling, repetitively, at a rate set by the person operating the iron lung's controls, to maintain continuous patient artificial respiration (artificial \"breathing\").<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\n===normal application===\nThe iron lung may assist normal patient respiration, or it may completely substitute for it, depending upon the patient's condition.

(Iron lungs must move larger quantities of air for every breath, because they must change the pressure of the air in the entire vessel, not just inflate the lungs).\n* Electrical power failure can result in prompt patient death. (Most iron lungs and similar devices lack backup power supplies. Manual power is an option on some units, but require multiple attendants, working alternately, to provide direct, continuous physical pumping of the iron lung's pump or diaphragm.)\n* Physical hazard to people and things in the immediate vicinity, because of exposed moving parts (Not true of all iron lungs).\n\n==Invention and early use==\n\n===Initial development===\n[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|Iron lung from the 1950s in the [[Stadtmuseum G\u00fctersloh|G\u00fctersloh Town Museum]].

Originally commissioned by the [[National Power Corporation]] (NAPOCOR), it is now operated and maintained by [[National Grid Corporation of the Philippines]] (NGCP). Prior to the completion of the line's cut-in connection to [[Meralco|Manila Electric Company]] (Meralco) Duhat substation in Duhat, [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]], [[Bulacan]] in November 16, 2009, it is a one-part power line. It originally had 504 steel poles (1\u201355, 58\u201398, 100\u2013263, 266\u2013496, 500\u2013511, and 515), 11 lattice towers (56, 57, 99, 264, 265, 497\u2013499, and 512\u2013514), and 12 portal towers totaling to 527 structures when the line was first commissioned. From 1994 to 2011, it had a length of 91 km (57 mi) and in March 2011, the length was reduced to 86.4 km (53.7 mi) due to the relocation of its [[San Simon, Pampanga|San Simon]]\u2013[[Pulilan]] segment.\n\nBefore the Lahar-Affected Relocation and Hermosa-Balintawak Relocation projects in 2003 and 2011, respectively, it consists of:\n* 32 steel poles (126-158; located at the western side of [[Jose Abad Santos Avenue]] (Olongapo-Gapan Road); retired except steel pole 127 which was used on a cut-in connection to Meralco Duhat Substation)\n* 3 portal towers (located between steel poles 139 and 140, and 144 and 145; retired)\n* 1 h-frame wood pole (used to replace steel pole 143 because it was washed out by [[lahar|lahars]] from [[Mt. Pinatubo]]; retired)\n* 84 steel poles and 2 lattice towers located along [[MacArthur Highway]] and [[Pulilan Regional Road]], respectively (228\u2013313; steel poles 228, 231, 232, 259, 260, 261, 266, 267, 271, 275, 276, 283, 301, and 302 and lattice towers 264 and 265 were reused. The other 70 steel poles (229, 230, 233\u2013258, 262, 263, 268\u2013270, 272\u2013274, 277\u2013282, 284\u2013300, and 303\u2013313) located in this segment, however, were retired.)\n\nAs of March 2011, the transmission line consists of:\n*483 steel poles (Hermosa\u2013Duhat segment: 1\u201355, 58\u201398, 100\u2013125, RHB-01\u2013RHB-30, 159\u2013254, 257\u2013265, 268\u2013289, 314\u2013429, and 3 steel poles used on its cut-in connection to Meralco Duhat substation in Duhat, Bocaue, Bulacan; Duhat\u2013Balintawak segment: 5 steel poles used on the line's cut-in connection to the said substation including original steel pole 127 along NLEX, 430\u2013496, 500\u2013511, and 515)\n*13 lattice towers (Hermosa\u2013Duhat segment: 56, 57, 99, 255, 256, 266, and 267; Duhat\u2013Balintawak segment: 497\u2013499, 512\u2013514)\n*9 portal towers\n*1 concrete pole (58A)\n \n===Hermosa\u2013Duhat===\nThe transmission line starts at Hermosa Substation and parallels with the [[Jose Abad Santos Avenue]] until San Fernando Exit of [[North Luzon Expressway]] (NLEX). Upon passing the [[Bataan]]\u2013[[Pampanga]] welcome arch, it enters Pampanga and continues straightforward. The line intersects with Hermosa\u2013Guagua in [[Lubao, Pampanga|Lubao]], Mexico\u2013Hermosa in Lubao, [[Guagua, Pampanga|Guagua]], [[Bacolor, Pampanga|Bacolor]], and [[San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], and Hermosa\u2013San Jose lines in Guagua while running parallel with the said avenue. Upon approaching Santa Barbara Bridge, it will utilize the eastern side of the avenue and after Villa del Sol in Magliman, San Fernando, the line again utilizes the western side of the road. It then passes through Lazatin and Dolores Flyovers and various establishments within San Fernando, and enters NLEX where it will run parallel into it until [[Smart Connect Interchange]].\n\nAfter entering NLEX, it intersects with Mexico\u2013Hermosa line for a fifth and final time. It continues on a straight route, intersects with Mexico\u2013Balintawak and Mexico\u2013Calumpit lines in [[Santo Tomas, Pampanga|Santo Tomas]], and passes through San Simon Exit (where the line formerly exited NLEX before the relocation of its San Simon\u2013Pulilan section in 2011) a few kilometers after intersecting these power lines. The line then continues on a straight direction, crosses into [[Pampanga River]] and [[Candaba Viaduct]], and enters [[Bulacan]] after passing a billboard located near steel pole 271. It will pass through Pulilan Exit (where it reentered NLEX from 1994 to 2011) and continues straightforward. The power line intersects with Hermosa\u2013San Jose in [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]] and Mexico\u2013Balintawak lines in [[Guiguinto]] for the second time, passes into Balagtas Interchange, Bigaa and Santa Maria Rivers, Bocaue Exit, Bocaue Toll Plaza, and Ciudad de Victoria Interchange. It turns left into Meralco Duhat Substation a few meters after passing Ciudad de Victoria interchange, where the line's Hermosa\u2013Duhat section ends.\n\n===Duhat\u2013Balintawak===\nThe line turns left upon entering NLEX and continues on a straight direction. A few meters after crossing Meycauayan River, it enters [[Metro Manila]]. It then utilize the western side of NLEX after steel pole 488, exits at Smart Connect Interchange, and passes through various establishments and institutions within [[Caloocan]] and [[Quezon City]] before the transmission line ends at Balintawak Substation, after crossing F. Carlos St.\n\n==Expansion and improvements==\nAs of 2019, the line has 382 painted structures (370 steel poles (89\u201398, 100\u2013125, RHB-1\u2013RHB-30, 178\u2013254, 257\u2013265, 268\u2013289, 314\u2013496, 500\u2013511, 515), 11 lattice towers (99, 255, 256, 266, 267, 497\u2013499, 512\u2013514), and 1 portal tower).\n\nThe [[National Transmission Corporation]] (TransCo) relocated its Santa Barbara Bridge\u2013Villa del Sol segment through the Lahar-Affected Transmission Line Relocation project, using 30 replacement steel poles.

Originally commissioned by the [[National Power Corporation]] (NAPOCOR), it is now operated and maintained by [[National Grid Corporation of the Philippines]] (NGCP). Prior to the completion of the line's cut-in connection to [[Meralco|Manila Electric Company]] (Meralco) Duhat substation in Duhat, [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]], [[Bulacan]] in November 16, 2009, it is a one-part power line. It originally had 504 steel poles (1\u201355, 58\u201398, 100\u2013263, 266\u2013496, 500\u2013511, and 515), 11 lattice towers (56, 57, 99, 264, 265, 497\u2013499, and 512\u2013514), and 12 portal towers totaling to 527 structures when the line was first commissioned. From 1994 to 2011, it had a length of 91 km (57 mi) and in March 2011, the length was reduced to 86.4 km (53.7 mi) due to the relocation of its [[San Simon, Pampanga|San Simon]]\u2013[[Pulilan]] segment.\n\nBefore the Lahar-Affected Relocation and Hermosa-Balintawak Relocation projects in 2003 and 2011, respectively, it consists of:\n* 32 steel poles (126-158; located at the western side of [[Jose Abad Santos Avenue]] (Olongapo-Gapan Road); retired except steel pole 127 which was used on a cut-in connection to Meralco Duhat Substation)\n* 3 portal towers (located between steel poles 139 and 140, and 144 and 145; retired)\n* 1 h-frame wood pole (used to replace steel pole 143 because it was washed out by [[lahar|lahars]] from [[Mt. Pinatubo]]; retired)\n* 84 steel poles and 2 lattice towers located along [[MacArthur Highway]] and [[Pulilan Regional Road]], respectively (228\u2013313; steel poles 228, 231, 232, 259, 260, 261, 266, 267, 271, 275, 276, 283, 301, and 302 and lattice towers 264 and 265 were reused. The other 70 steel poles (229, 230, 233\u2013258, 262, 263, 268\u2013270, 272\u2013274, 277\u2013282, 284\u2013300, and 303\u2013313) located in this segment, however, were retired.)\n\nAs of March 2011, the transmission line consists of:\n*483 steel poles (Hermosa\u2013Duhat segment: 1\u201355, 58\u201398, 100\u2013125, RHB-01\u2013RHB-30, 159\u2013254, 257\u2013265, 268\u2013289, 314\u2013429, and 3 steel poles used on its cut-in connection to Meralco Duhat substation in Duhat, Bocaue, Bulacan; Duhat\u2013Balintawak segment: 5 steel poles used on the line's cut-in connection to the said substation including original steel pole 127 along NLEX, 430\u2013496, 500\u2013511, and 515)\n*13 lattice towers (Hermosa\u2013Duhat segment: 56, 57, 99, 255, 256, 266, and 267; Duhat\u2013Balintawak segment: 497\u2013499, 512\u2013514)\n*9 portal towers\n*1 concrete pole (58A)\n \n===Hermosa\u2013Duhat===\nThe transmission line starts at Hermosa Substation and parallels with the [[Jose Abad Santos Avenue]] until San Fernando Exit of [[North Luzon Expressway]] (NLEX). Upon passing the [[Bataan]]\u2013[[Pampanga]] welcome arch, it enters Pampanga and continues straightforward. The line intersects with Hermosa\u2013Guagua in [[Lubao, Pampanga|Lubao]], Mexico\u2013Hermosa in Lubao, [[Guagua, Pampanga|Guagua]], [[Bacolor, Pampanga|Bacolor]], and [[San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], and Hermosa\u2013San Jose lines in Guagua while running parallel with the said avenue. Upon approaching Santa Barbara Bridge, it will utilize the eastern side of the avenue and after Villa del Sol in Magliman, San Fernando, the line again utilizes the western side of the road. It then passes through Lazatin and Dolores Flyovers and various establishments within San Fernando, and enters NLEX where it will run parallel into it until [[Smart Connect Interchange]].\n\nAfter entering NLEX, it intersects with Mexico\u2013Hermosa line for a fifth and final time. It continues on a straight route, intersects with Mexico\u2013Balintawak and Mexico\u2013Calumpit lines in [[Santo Tomas, Pampanga|Santo Tomas]], and passes through San Simon Exit (where the line formerly exited NLEX before the relocation of its San Simon\u2013Pulilan section in 2011) a few kilometers after intersecting these power lines. The line then continues on a straight direction, crosses into [[Pampanga River]] and [[Candaba Viaduct]], and enters [[Bulacan]] after passing a billboard located near steel pole 271. It will pass through Pulilan Exit (where it reentered NLEX from 1994 to 2011) and continues straightforward. The power line intersects with Hermosa\u2013San Jose in [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]] and Mexico\u2013Balintawak lines in [[Guiguinto]] for the second time, passes into Balagtas Interchange, Bigaa and Santa Maria Rivers, Bocaue Exit, Bocaue Toll Plaza, and Ciudad de Victoria Interchange. It turns left into Meralco Duhat Substation a few meters after passing Ciudad de Victoria interchange, where the line's Hermosa\u2013Duhat section ends.\n\n===Duhat\u2013Balintawak===\nThe line turns left upon entering NLEX and continues on a straight direction. A few meters after crossing Meycauayan River, it enters [[Metro Manila]]. It then utilize the western side of NLEX after steel pole 488, exits at Smart Connect Interchange, and passes through various establishments and institutions within [[Caloocan]] and [[Quezon City]] before the transmission line ends at Balintawak Substation, after crossing F. Carlos St.\n\n==Expansion and improvements==\nAs of 2019, the line has 382 painted structures (370 steel poles (89\u201398, 100\u2013125, RHB-1\u2013RHB-30, 178\u2013254, 257\u2013265, 268\u2013289, 314\u2013496, 500\u2013511, 515), 11 lattice towers (99, 255, 256, 266, 267, 497\u2013499, 512\u2013514), and 1 portal tower).\n\nThe [[National Transmission Corporation]] (TransCo) relocated its Santa Barbara Bridge\u2013Villa del Sol segment through the Lahar-Affected Transmission Line Relocation project, using 30 replacement steel poles. It was completed in April 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://beta.philstar.com/business/2003/04/24/203568/transco-completes-p258-m-project|title=Transco completes P 258 million project|last=|first=|date=|website=[[The Philippine Star|www.philstar.com]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, 3 steel poles were relocated due to the construction of Dulalia Overpass using 2 existing steel poles (473 and 475) and 1 replacement steel pole (474).\n\nThe cut-in connection to Meralco Duhat substation was constructed to avoid line overloading and maintain N-1 contingency. It was completed in November 16, 2009.\n\nIn 2010, 3 replacement and higher steel poles (381\u2013383) were used due to the construction of Plaridel Bypass Road, with NAPOCOR-era steel poles 381 and 382 were reused as part of Hermosa-San Jose line while pole 383 was retired.\n\nIn March 25, 2011, the Hermosa-Balintawak Transmission Line Relocation project was completed.

S. Ravikumar]]. It starred [[R. Sarathkumar|Sarath Kumar]], [[Meena Durairaj|Meena]] and [[Kushboo Sundar|Kushboo]] in the lead roles. The film became a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] among 1994 Deepavali releases and completed a 175-day run at the box office. It is considered to be one of the most popular Tamil films of the 1990s and in general. It became a trendsetter for many films in later years. The [[Goundamani]]-[[Senthil]] [[comic duo]] was one of the most popular aspects of the film.\n\nR. Sarathkumar earned both the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor]] and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor \u2013 Tamil]] for his performance in the film. The film was later remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Pedarayudu]]'', in [[Hindi]] as ''[[Bulandi (2000 film)|Bulandi]]'' and in [[Kannada]] as ''[[Simhadriya Simha]]'' (2000).\n\n==Plot==\nShanmugam ([[R. Sarathkumar|Sarath Kumar]]) is the village head, fondly called Nattamai. He is widely respected by everyone for his genuineness. He lives with his wife Lakshmi ([[Kushboo (actress)|Kushboo]]) and brother Pasupathi (R. Sarathkumar). Pasupathi is married to Meena ([[Meena Durairaj|Meena]]). There is a long-standing enmity between Nattamai and his paternal cousin ([[Ponnambalam (actor)|Ponnambalam]]). A flashback is shown where Ponnambalam's father kills Shanmugam's father ([[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]]), following which Ponnambalam's family is expelled from the village. Ponnambalam waits for the right time to attack Nattamai's family. Ponnambalam's mother ([[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]) is Nattamai's paternal aunt. A new teacher ([[Rani (Tamil actress)|Rani]]), comes to the village and everyone suspects an illegitimate relationship between her and Pasupathi. One day, the teacher gets killed along with a death note mentioning Pasupathi as the reason behind her death, following which Nattamai expels Pasupathi out of the village. The teacher was actually killed by Ponnambalam, with plans of trapping Pasupathi in the murder. Manorama overhears the truth but gets locked by Ponnambalam at her home. Ponnambalam tries to kill Nattamai but gets killed by Manorama. Finally, Manorama informs the truth to Nattamai, which shocks him. Nattamai dies at the spot due to the guilt of giving a wrong judgment, and Pasupathi becomes the next Nattamai.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]] as Nattamai's father [Periya Nattamai]\n* [[R.

S. Ravikumar]]. It starred [[R. Sarathkumar|Sarath Kumar]], [[Meena Durairaj|Meena]] and [[Kushboo Sundar|Kushboo]] in the lead roles. The film became a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] among 1994 Deepavali releases and completed a 175-day run at the box office. It is considered to be one of the most popular Tamil films of the 1990s and in general. It became a trendsetter for many films in later years. The [[Goundamani]]-[[Senthil]] [[comic duo]] was one of the most popular aspects of the film.\n\nR. Sarathkumar earned both the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor]] and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor \u2013 Tamil]] for his performance in the film. The film was later remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Pedarayudu]]'', in [[Hindi]] as ''[[Bulandi (2000 film)|Bulandi]]'' and in [[Kannada]] as ''[[Simhadriya Simha]]'' (2000).\n\n==Plot==\nShanmugam ([[R. Sarathkumar|Sarath Kumar]]) is the village head, fondly called Nattamai. He is widely respected by everyone for his genuineness. He lives with his wife Lakshmi ([[Kushboo (actress)|Kushboo]]) and brother Pasupathi (R. Sarathkumar). Pasupathi is married to Meena ([[Meena Durairaj|Meena]]). There is a long-standing enmity between Nattamai and his paternal cousin ([[Ponnambalam (actor)|Ponnambalam]]). A flashback is shown where Ponnambalam's father kills Shanmugam's father ([[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]]), following which Ponnambalam's family is expelled from the village. Ponnambalam waits for the right time to attack Nattamai's family. Ponnambalam's mother ([[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]) is Nattamai's paternal aunt. A new teacher ([[Rani (Tamil actress)|Rani]]), comes to the village and everyone suspects an illegitimate relationship between her and Pasupathi. One day, the teacher gets killed along with a death note mentioning Pasupathi as the reason behind her death, following which Nattamai expels Pasupathi out of the village. The teacher was actually killed by Ponnambalam, with plans of trapping Pasupathi in the murder. Manorama overhears the truth but gets locked by Ponnambalam at her home. Ponnambalam tries to kill Nattamai but gets killed by Manorama. Finally, Manorama informs the truth to Nattamai, which shocks him. Nattamai dies at the spot due to the guilt of giving a wrong judgment, and Pasupathi becomes the next Nattamai.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]] as Nattamai's father [Periya Nattamai]\n* [[R.

and [[mixed martial artist]], better known simply as {{nihongo|'''Syuri'''|\u6731\u91cc|Shuri}}.\n\nOriginally trained by [[Yoshihiro Tajiri|Tajiri]], she started her professional wrestling career in the [[Hustle (professional wrestling)|Hustle]] promotion, where she worked under the [[ring name]] KG (Karate Girl). She later also worked for Hustle's two follow-up promotions; [[Smash (professional wrestling)|Smash]], where she was the final [[Smash Diva Championship|Smash Diva Champion]], and [[Wrestling New Classic]] (WNC), where she was a two-time [[WNC Women's Championship|WNC Women's Champion]]. After WNC folded in June 2014, she remained affiliated with its sister promotion Reina Joshi Puroresu until March 2016, becoming a one-time Reina World Women's Champion and a one-time [[Reina World Tag Team Championship|Reina World Tag Team Champion]]. Through Reina's relationship with [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), Syuri has also worked in [[Mexico]], where she is a former [[CMLL World Women's Championship|CMLL World Women's Champion]] and [[CMLL-Reina International Championship|CMLL-Reina International Champion]].\n\nComing from a [[karate]] background, Kondo made her shoot boxing debut in 2009 and afterwards affiliated herself with the Krush promotion as a kickboxer. Over the next six years she amassed a record of 13 wins and one loss, while also becoming the inaugural Krush Women's Champion in March 2014.

The court held that such wide restrictions of basic rights may be adopted only under the Crisis Act by the Government as whole and not under Protection of Public Health Act by the Ministry of Health alone. Both the curfew and retail sale ban were originally adopted by Government Resolutions on 14 and 15 March respectively, however then they were replaced by Ministry of Health Protection Measures from 24 March onwards.

The court held that such wide restrictions of basic rights may be adopted only under the Crisis Act by the Government as whole and not under Protection of Public Health Act by the Ministry of Health alone. Both the curfew and retail sale ban were originally adopted by Government Resolutions on 14 and 15 March respectively, however then they were replaced by Ministry of Health Protection Measures from 24 March onwards.

Much of his more commercial work was in collaboration with [[Vesa-Matti Loiri]] (whose most popular character created by Pasanen was [[Uuno Turhapuro]]; first in TV sketches and then in a long-lasting series of motion pictures) and [[Simo Salminen]]. Pasanen's films and TV shows, often made fast and inexpensively in a conveyor-belt mode, usually didn't gain much recognition from the [[critics]] but were extremely popular among Finnish audiences from the 1960s onwards.\n\nHe was the owner of his own film production company, Filmituotanto Spede Pasanen Ky. He is noted as the main influence of many who make an attempt to break into the Finnish comedy scene. Spede also had a long, strained relationship with [[Suomen elokuvas\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6]], a government-financed film-funding organisation which continuously refused to fund his movies. Kut kuri\n\n==Radio career==\n[[File:Pasanen-Haarla-Alpola-1960.jpg|thumb|right|Pertti Pasanen (left) with Aune Haarla and Antero Alpola at Yleisradio's entertainment division in 1960.]]\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s Spede was a noted presence as a radio comedian. He applied to work at [[Yleisradio]] twice in 1956 and again in 1959 as an entertainment provider (ajanvietetoimittaja) and was hired on his second try. Spede's most popular program was ''Ruljanssiriihi'' which combined sketch-comedy and musical performances. The program eventually developed into the program ''Hupiklubi''. Spede and actor [[Leo Jokela]] also created the break-out character [[G. Pula-Aho]] (voiced by Jokela), a smart-talking, Helsinki slang using parrot who would insult Spede on Ruljanssiriihi.\n\nSpede's other programs included ''Tervah\u00f6yry Hyrskynmyrskyn suvisilla laineilla'', ''Hyv\u00e4\u00e4 iltaa \u2013 tulkaa mukaan'' and ''Kes\u00e4ter\u00e4ss\u00e4''.\n\n==Film career==\nAfter playing several supporting roles throughout the 1950s Spede made his first starring appearance in 1964's [[X-Paroni]] which he wrote and co-directed with his on-screen co-star [[Jaakko Pakkasvirta]]. The movie's success led to the creation of [[Milli Pilleri]] which also introduced moviegoers to [[Simo Salminen]] who became a fixture of Spede's acting troupe, often playing the side-kick to Spede's own characters. It was also the first movie Spede co-directed with [[Jukka Virtanen (director)|Jukka Virtanen]] and [[Ere Kokkonen]] who would alternate directing Spede's future motion pictures, while Spede focused more on writing and producing.\n\n1967's period-comedy [[Noin Seitsem\u00e4n Veljest\u00e4]] was a parody of [[Robin Hood]] which Spede had worked on since the 1950s and introduced [[Vesa-Matti Loiri]] as an adult actor (having made his on-screen debut years earlier as a child actor in [[Pojat (film)|Pojat]]). The success of these movies led to Spede producing and releasing three movies in 1969, [[N\u00e4k\u00f6radiomiehen ihmeelliset siekailut]], [[Leikkikalugangsteri]] as well as his first colour feature [[Pohjan T\u00e4hteet]]. N\u00e4k\u00f6radiomies performed well despite being a more serious movie but it and Pohjan T\u00e4hteet underperformed in comparison to the more typically comical Leikkikalugangsteri. Despite Pohjant\u00e4hteet winning a shared [[Jussi Award]] for Kari Sohlberg in the category of best cinematography<ref>{{cite web | title = IMDB - Jussi Awards 1970 | url= https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000380/1970 | publisher = Internet Movie Database| date = 4 May 2016}}</ref> (with Spede's own Leikkikalugangsteri and [[J\u00f6rn Donner]]'s Sixtynine 69), Pasanen did not produce another colour feature until the late 1970s.\n\nSpede continued to experience success with [[Speedy Gonzales \u2013 noin 7 veljeksen poika]] and the tragic comedy [[Jussi Pussi]] both released in 1970. Speedy Gonzales performed well, despite Vesa-Matti Loiri being absent due to a leg injury just prior to shooting (he instead received a writing credit). Spede had to finance most of his films during this period due to his poor relations with the Finnish Film Foundation.\n\nIn 1971, Spede released three motion-pictures, [[Kahdekses Veljes]] (his debut as a solo director) and [[Hirtt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6m\u00e4t]] (the sequel to Speedy Gonzales) both starring himself as well as [[Saatanan Radikaalit]], which was co-directed by its four starring actors Paavo Piironen, Heikki Nousiainen, Timo Nissi and Heikki Huopainen. Spede only produced this movie which was intended to give its four stars a chance to complete a motion-picture on their own. All three movies under-performed though which led to Spede taking a two-year hiatus from film-making during which he focused exclusively on his TV work. Regardless, Spede won the 1971 Producers' Jussi Award for all three movies.<ref>{{cite web | title = IMDB - Jussi Awards 1971 | url= https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000380/1971 | publisher = Internet Movie Database| date = 3 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, Spede released the first [[Uuno Turhapuro]] movie based on the popular skit-character by the same name. To save costs, Spede filmed and edited the movie entirely on video and had it transferred to film for theatrical distribution. Uuno became a hit and a further four Uuno films were finished during the 1970s. Spede resumed filming small budget comedies with 1974's [[Viu-Hah-Hah-Taja]], directed by [[Ere Kokkonen]] and mostly starring Spede's TV actors. Spede only appeared in a cameo and went uncredited as the film's writer. In 1979, he released [[Koeputkiaikuinen ja Simon enkelit]], his first colour feature since Pohjant\u00e4hteet. The movie was a surprise hit and led to a sequel [[Tup Akka Lakko]] being released the following year.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Uuno series peaked in popularity with 1984's [[Uuno Turhapuro armeijan leiviss\u00e4]] breaking the record of the most popular Finnish domestic film. Spede cranked out movies on an annual basis, using his stock actors and frequently utilizing the popular skit characters for movies such as [[Kliffaa Hei]], [[Pikkupojat]], [[Fakta Homma (film)|Fakta Homma]] and [[Onks Viljoo N\u00e4kyny]]. The last of these skit-comedy films is considered to be 1990s [[Rampe & Naukkis - Kaikkien aikojen superpari]], which was lampooned on the popular characters created by [[Pirkka-Pekka Petelius]] and [[Aake Kalliala]] for the TV show [[Pulttibois]].\n\nDuring the 1990s, Spede focused almost exclusively on producing rather than writing or directing films with TV work taking more and more of his time.\n\n==TV career==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nStarting from 1964, Spede began making live 15-minute sketch programming for [[Yleisradio]]. The show which alternated between the titles Spedevisio, Speden Saluuna as well as Spede Show established many of the tropes and core actors whom Spede would use in his films. Most of the early skit work is now lost due to live broadcasts not being routinely recorded. Spede appeared on TV continuously until 1976 when he started to focus primarily on film work.\n\nStarting from 1981, Spede once again put priority on TV work. First airing surviving black and white skits on the recently established independent Mainos-TV channel, Spede, Simo Salminen and Vesa-Matti Loiri began producing new skits. [[Hannele Lauri]] also joined as a regular cast-member. The new Spede Show continued to air until 1987 when Spede and Loiri had a mock-feud which led to the launch of Vesa-Matti Loiri's own TV sketch show, Vesku Show. Throughout the 1980s, Spede also produced other programs such as the comedy program ''Fakta Homma'' and the competition show ''[[Kymppitonni]]'' with host [[Riitta V\u00e4is\u00e4nen]].\n\nBy the 1990s, Spede was himself tired of sketch-work but produced [[Aake Kalliala]]'s and [[Pirkka-Pekka Petelius]]'s [[Pulttibois]] and [[Tsa Tsa Tsaa]] as well as the sporty competition show [[Speden Spelit]]. Pasanen also produced more drama-programming such as ''Hynttyyt Yhteen'', ''Blondi Tuli Taloon'', and ''Ihmeiden tekij\u00e4t'' (as well as its follow-up, ''Parhaat Vuodet''). Many of these shows became stables of MTV3 with many of them airing for several seasons. Spede also approved the production of the dramedy-series ''Kuumia Aaltoja'', which aired in 2003 (two years after his death).\n\n==Influences and comedy==\nSpede Pasanen named [[Bob Hope]] as one of his biggest comedy influences.\n\nSpede Pasanen is considered emblematic of [[Savonian people|Savonian]] ironic humor varying between the fullest extremes of understatement and hyperbole. As he himself explained: \"A Savonian never tells a thing exactly like it is.\" Spede's comedy denounced elitism and he explicitly sought to write and perform comedy for the largest possible audience. His early films in particular, featured elements uncommon to Finnish cinema such as fist-fights, car chases, other elaborate stunt-work as well as unconventional special effects. Many of his movies also featured unconventional settings (such as the medieval period or the wild west), though his later films focused almost entirely on poking fun at Finnish stereotypes.\n\nHis Uuno Turhapuro movies can be considered conventional [[farce]]s. An unemployed slacker will, with comically incredible luck, a father-in-law who is rich and connected but unlucky (mainly due to Uuno), and with slick charm, end up in roles of minister, general officer, or rich man, usually causing havoc in the father-in-law's businesses.\n\n==Other achievements==\nPasanen was also an inventor and jack-of-all-trades; he had over 50 [[patent]]s registered to his name, and many of his films include [[Rube Goldberg]]-style gadgets. Besides gadgets involved with industrial production, his inventions include:\n\n*The [[Ski jumping sling]]\n*A [[Boat ski]] (to alleviate *bumps* in aquaplaning boat)\n*A self-extinguishing, one-size-fits-all [[candlestick]].\n\nFor a period of time Pasanen was also obsessed with inventing a [[perpetual motion]] device. His crude drawings of it also appeared in his sketchs shows and films. Once he became convinced that perpetual motion is theoretically impossible, he openly ridiculed himself in the character of ''H\u00e4rski Hartikainen'' in one of the Uuno Turhapuro movies.\n\n==Personal life==\nSpede married Pirjo Vainim\u00e4ki, the leading lady of his first starring picture ''[[X-Paroni]]'', in 1965. Spede's first and only child, [[Pirre Pasanen]], was born later that year. The couple separated in the early 1980s and divorced later.\n\nA family private individual, Pasanen did not discuss his personal relationships in public. He had a long relationship with the 1976 [[Miss Europe]], [[Riitta V\u00e4is\u00e4nen]]. Pasanen valued loyalty and friendship, and even after separation, kept employing and financially supporting previous companions. During and after relationships, he vouchsafed confidentiality and privacy for all involved in his private life. His good relations with the media might have helped with this.\n\nPasanen's nickname \"Spede\" came from an earlier nickname \"Speedy\", referring to his prowess as an [[ice hockey]] player during his childhood.<ref>Toiviainen, Sakari: [http://www.kava.fi/elavan-kuvan-museo/arkiston-aarteet/memoriam/kotimaiset-henkilot/spede-pasanen Spede Pasanen].

Accessed on 10 September 2012.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn 7 September 2001 Pasanen was playing a round of golf at the Sarfvik golf course in Kirkkonummi, Finland. At the 9th hole he began to feel ill and was taken to the club house, where his condition rapidly deteriorated. Despite resuscitation by a doctor and a rapid response of emergency medical services Pasanen died. His death was attributed to advanced [[coronary artery disease]].<ref>[https://www.is.fi/viihde/art-2000001253015.html Speden dramaattiset viime hetket \u2013 \u201dPertti pelk\u00e4si l\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4reit\u00e4\u201d] Iltasanomat.fi 2016-09-03]</ref>\n\n==Notable collaborators==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ere Kokkonen]]\n* [[Jukka Virtanen (director)|Jukka Virtanen]]\n* [[Simo Salminen]]\n* [[Vesa-Matti Loiri]]\n* [[Leo Jokela]]\n* [[Riitta V\u00e4is\u00e4nen]] \n* [[Pentti Siimes]]\n* [[Olavi Ahonen]]\n* [[Juhani Kumpulainen]]\n* [[Hannele Lauri]]\n* [[Marita Nordberg]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n=== Writer, director or producer ===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[X-Paroni]]'' (directed with [[Jaakko Pakkasvirta]], 1964), in English ''The X-baron''\n* ''[[Millipilleri]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[P\u00e4hk\u00e4hullu Suomi]]'' (1967), in English ''The nutty Finland''\n* ''[[Noin seitsem\u00e4n veljest\u00e4]]'' (1968), in English ''About seven Brothers''\n* ''[[N\u00e4k\u00f6radiomiehen ihmeelliset siekailut]]'' (1969)\n* ''[[Leikkikalugangsteri]]'' (1969), in English ''The Toy Gangster''\n* ''[[Pohjan t\u00e4hteet]]'' (1969)\n* ''Jussi Pussi'' (1970)\n* ''[[Speedy Gonzales \u2013 noin 7 veljeksen poika]]'' (1970)\n* ''[[Saatanan radikaalit]]'' (1971) (Producer only)\n* ''Kahdeksas veljes'' (1971), in English ''The Eighth Brother''\n* ''[[Hirtt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6m\u00e4t]]'' (1971)\n* ''[[Uuno Turhapuro (film)|Uuno Turhapuro]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Viu-hah hah-taja]]'' (1974)\n* ''[[Professori Uuno D.G.

Starting his career on [[Yleisradio]] he later jumped camps to the competing [[MTV3]] network. However, his work on both has been extremely popular. Apart from starring in these series he was also the main producer for many of the popular shows on MTV3, such as the game-show ''Kymppitonni'' and the cult-hit show ''Pulttibois''.\n\n====Yle====\n* ''Spede Show'' (1964, 1971\u20131976, 1982 ja 1984-1987)\n* ''Speden saluuna'' (1965)\n* ''Spedevisio'' (1965\u20131967)\n* ''50 pient\u00e4 minuuttia'' (1967\u20131971)\n* ''Robin Hood ja h\u00e4nen iloiset vekkulinsa Sherwoodin pusikoissa'' (1974)\n\n====MTV3====\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''Kymppitonni'' (1985\u20132005)\n* ''Uuno Turhapuro armeijan leiviss\u00e4'' (1986) (the film as a TV series)\n* ''Vesku Show'' (1988\u20131991)\n* ''[[Spede Special]]'' (1988\u20131990)\n* ''[[Pulttibois]]'' (1989\u20131991)\n* ''[[Spedestroikka]]'' (1990)\n* ''Junnutonni'' (1991)\n* ''[[Speden sallitut leikit]]'' (1990\u20131992)\n* ''Speden tee-se-itse TV'' (1991\u20131992)\n* ''Hynttyyt yhteen'' (1991\u20131995)\n* ''[[Speden spelit]]'' (1992\u20132002)\n* ''Tsa Tsa Tsaa'' (1993\u20131994)\n* ''Blondi tuli taloon'' (1994\u20131995)\n* ''Uuno Turhapuro'' (TV series) (1996)\n* ''Ihmeidentekij\u00e4t'' (1996\u20131998)\n* ''Parhaat vuodet'' (2000\u20132002)\n* ''Kuumia aaltoja'' (2003)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Named after Spede Pasanen ==\n* SPEDE (Spacecraft Potential, Electron and Dust Experiment), an instrument attached to the [[SMART-1]] lunar probe.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* {{commons category-inline|Spede Pasanen}}\n* {{IMDb name|0664218}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pasanen, Spede}}\n[[Category:Spede Pasanen| ]]\n[[Category:1930 births]]\n[[Category:2001 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Kuopio]]\n[[Category:Finnish film producers]]\n[[Category:Finnish film directors]]\n[[Category:Finnish writers]]\n[[Category:Finnish-language writers]]\n[[Category:Finnish male actors]]\n[[Category:Finnish inventors]]\n[[Category:Finnish comedians]]\n[[Category:20th-century comedians]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=September 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name                      = Spede Pasanen\n| image                     = Pertti-Pasanen-1964b.jpg\n| caption                   = Spede Pasanen, 1964.\n| image_size                = \n| alt                       =\n| birth_name                = Pertti Olavi Pasanen\n| birth_date                = {{birth date|df=yes|1930|4|10}}\n| birth_place               = [[Kuopio]], Finland\n| death_date                = {{death date and age|df=yes|2001|9|7|1930|4|10}}\n| death_place               = [[Kirkkonummi]], Finland\n| death_cause               =\n| resting_place             =\n| residence                 =\n| nationality               =\n| ethnicity                 =\n| citizenship               =\n| other_names               =\n| known_for                 =\n| education                 =\n| alma_mater                =\n| notable works             =\n| occupation                = Film director and producer, comedian, inventor\n| years_active              =\n| home_town                 =\n| spouse                    =\n| partner                   =\n| children                  =\n| parents                   =\n| relations                 =\n| awards                    =\n| signature                 = \n| website                   =\n}}\n'''Pertti Olavi \"Spede\" Pasanen''' (10 April 1930 &ndash; 7 September 2001) was a Finnish film director and producer, comedian, humorist, inventor, TV personality and practitioner of gags.\n\nDuring his career he directed, wrote, produced or acted in about 50 [[film|movie]]s and participated in numerous TV productions, including the comedy ''Spede Show'' and the game-show ''Speden Spelit''. Much of his more commercial work was in collaboration with [[Vesa-Matti Loiri]] (whose most popular character created by Pasanen was [[Uuno Turhapuro]]; first in TV sketches and then in a long-lasting series of motion pictures) and [[Simo Salminen]]. Pasanen's films and TV shows, often made fast and inexpensively in a conveyor-belt mode, usually didn't gain much recognition from the [[critics]] but were extremely popular among Finnish audiences from the 1960s onwards.\n\nHe was the owner of his own film production company, Filmituotanto Spede Pasanen Ky. He is noted as the main influence of many who make an attempt to break into the Finnish comedy scene. Spede also had a long, strained relationship with [[Suomen elokuvas\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6]], a government-financed film-funding organisation which continuously refused to fund his movies.\n\n==Radio career==\n[[File:Pasanen-Haarla-Alpola-1960.jpg|thumb|right|Pertti Pasanen (left) with Aune Haarla and Antero Alpola at Yleisradio's entertainment division in 1960.]]\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s Spede was a noted presence as a radio comedian. He applied to work at [[Yleisradio]] twice in 1956 and again in 1959 as an entertainment provider (ajanvietetoimittaja) and was hired on his second try. Spede's most popular program was ''Ruljanssiriihi'' which combined sketch-comedy and musical performances. The program eventually developed into the program ''Hupiklubi''. Spede and actor [[Leo Jokela]] also created the break-out character [[G. Pula-Aho]] (voiced by Jokela), a smart-talking, Helsinki slang using parrot who would insult Spede on Ruljanssiriihi.\n\nSpede's other programs included ''Tervah\u00f6yry Hyrskynmyrskyn suvisilla laineilla'', ''Hyv\u00e4\u00e4 iltaa \u2013 tulkaa mukaan'' and ''Kes\u00e4ter\u00e4ss\u00e4''.\n\n==Film career==\nAfter playing several supporting roles throughout the 1950s Spede made his first starring appearance in 1964's [[X-Paroni]] which he wrote and co-directed with his on-screen co-star [[Jaakko Pakkasvirta]]. The movie's success led to the creation of [[Milli Pilleri]] which also introduced moviegoers to [[Simo Salminen]] who became a fixture of Spede's acting troupe, often playing the side-kick to Spede's own characters. It was also the first movie Spede co-directed with [[Jukka Virtanen (director)|Jukka Virtanen]] and [[Ere Kokkonen]] who would alternate directing Spede's future motion pictures, while Spede focused more on writing and producing.\n\n1967's period-comedy [[Noin Seitsem\u00e4n Veljest\u00e4]] was a parody of [[Robin Hood]] which Spede had worked on since the 1950s and introduced [[Vesa-Matti Loiri]] as an adult actor (having made his on-screen debut years earlier as a child actor in [[Pojat (film)|Pojat]]). The success of these movies led to Spede producing and releasing three movies in 1969, [[N\u00e4k\u00f6radiomiehen ihmeelliset siekailut]], [[Leikkikalugangsteri]] as well as his first colour feature [[Pohjan T\u00e4hteet]]. N\u00e4k\u00f6radiomies performed well despite being a more serious movie but it and Pohjan T\u00e4hteet underperformed in comparison to the more typically comical Leikkikalugangsteri. Despite Pohjant\u00e4hteet winning a shared [[Jussi Award]] for Kari Sohlberg in the category of best cinematography<ref>{{cite web | title = IMDB - Jussi Awards 1970 | url= https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000380/1970 | publisher = Internet Movie Database| date = 4 May 2016}}</ref> (with Spede's own Leikkikalugangsteri and [[J\u00f6rn Donner]]'s Sixtynine 69), Pasanen did not produce another colour feature until the late 1970s.\n\nSpede continued to experience success with [[Speedy Gonzales \u2013 noin 7 veljeksen poika]] and the tragic comedy [[Jussi Pussi]] both released in 1970. Speedy Gonzales performed well, despite Vesa-Matti Loiri being absent due to a leg injury just prior to shooting (he instead received a writing credit). Spede had to finance most of his films during this period due to his poor relations with the Finnish Film Foundation.\n\nIn 1971, Spede released three motion-pictures, [[Kahdekses Veljes]] (his debut as a solo director) and [[Hirtt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6m\u00e4t]] (the sequel to Speedy Gonzales) both starring himself as well as [[Saatanan Radikaalit]], which was co-directed by its four starring actors Paavo Piironen, Heikki Nousiainen, Timo Nissi and Heikki Huopainen. Spede only produced this movie which was intended to give its four stars a chance to complete a motion-picture on their own. All three movies under-performed though which led to Spede taking a two-year hiatus from film-making during which he focused exclusively on his TV work. Regardless, Spede won the 1971 Producers' Jussi Award for all three movies.<ref>{{cite web | title = IMDB - Jussi Awards 1971 | url= https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000380/1971 | publisher = Internet Movie Database| date = 3 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, Spede released the first [[Uuno Turhapuro]] movie based on the popular skit-character by the same name. To save costs, Spede filmed and edited the movie entirely on video and had it transferred to film for theatrical distribution. Uuno became a hit and a further four Uuno films were finished during the 1970s. Spede resumed filming small budget comedies with 1974's [[Viu-Hah-Hah-Taja]], directed by [[Ere Kokkonen]] and mostly starring Spede's TV actors. Spede only appeared in a cameo and went uncredited as the film's writer. In 1979, he released [[Koeputkiaikuinen ja Simon enkelit]], his first colour feature since Pohjant\u00e4hteet. The movie was a surprise hit and led to a sequel [[Tup Akka Lakko]] being released the following year.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Uuno series peaked in popularity with 1984's [[Uuno Turhapuro armeijan leiviss\u00e4]] breaking the record of the most popular Finnish domestic film. Spede cranked out movies on an annual basis, using his stock actors and frequently utilizing the popular skit characters for movies such as [[Kliffaa Hei]], [[Pikkupojat]], [[Fakta Homma (film)|Fakta Homma]] and [[Onks Viljoo N\u00e4kyny]]. The last of these skit-comedy films is considered to be 1990s [[Rampe & Naukkis - Kaikkien aikojen superpari]], which was lampooned on the popular characters created by [[Pirkka-Pekka Petelius]] and [[Aake Kalliala]] for the TV show [[Pulttibois]].\n\nDuring the 1990s, Spede focused almost exclusively on producing rather than writing or directing films with TV work taking more and more of his time.\n\n==TV career==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nStarting from 1964, Spede began making live 15-minute sketch programming for [[Yleisradio]]. The show which alternated between the titles Spedevisio, Speden Saluuna as well as Spede Show established many of the tropes and core actors whom Spede would use in his films. Most of the early skit work is now lost due to live broadcasts not being routinely recorded. Spede appeared on TV continuously until 1976 when he started to focus primarily on film work.\n\nStarting from 1981, Spede once again put priority on TV work. First airing surviving black and white skits on the recently established independent Mainos-TV channel, Spede, Simo Salminen and Vesa-Matti Loiri began producing new skits. [[Hannele Lauri]] also joined as a regular cast-member. The new Spede Show continued to air until 1987 when Spede and Loiri had a mock-feud which led to the launch of Vesa-Matti Loiri's own TV sketch show, Vesku Show. Throughout the 1980s, Spede also produced other programs such as the comedy program ''Fakta Homma'' and the competition show ''[[Kymppitonni]]'' with host [[Riitta V\u00e4is\u00e4nen]].\n\nBy the 1990s, Spede was himself tired of sketch-work but produced [[Aake Kalliala]]'s and [[Pirkka-Pekka Petelius]]'s [[Pulttibois]] and [[Tsa Tsa Tsaa]] as well as the sporty competition show [[Speden Spelit]]. Pasanen also produced more drama-programming such as ''Hynttyyt Yhteen'', ''Blondi Tuli Taloon'', and ''Ihmeiden tekij\u00e4t'' (as well as its follow-up, ''Parhaat Vuodet''). Many of these shows became stables of MTV3 with many of them airing for several seasons. Spede also approved the production of the dramedy-series ''Kuumia Aaltoja'', which aired in 2003 (two years after his death).\n\n==Influences and comedy==\nSpede Pasanen named [[Bob Hope]] as one of his biggest comedy influences.\n\nSpede Pasanen is considered emblematic of [[Savonian people|Savonian]] ironic humor varying between the fullest extremes of understatement and hyperbole. As he himself explained: \"A Savonian never tells a thing exactly like it is.\" Spede's comedy denounced elitism and he explicitly sought to write and perform comedy for the largest possible audience. His early films in particular, featured elements uncommon to Finnish cinema such as fist-fights, car chases, other elaborate stunt-work as well as unconventional special effects. Many of his movies also featured unconventional settings (such as the medieval period or the wild west), though his later films focused almost entirely on poking fun at Finnish stereotypes.\n\nHis Uuno Turhapuro movies can be considered conventional [[farce]]s. An unemployed slacker will, with comically incredible luck, a father-in-law who is rich and connected but unlucky (mainly due to Uuno), and with slick charm, end up in roles of minister, general officer, or rich man, usually causing havoc in the father-in-law's businesses.\n\n==Other achievements==\nPasanen was also an inventor and jack-of-all-trades; he had over 50 [[patent]]s registered to his name, and many of his films include [[Rube Goldberg]]-style gadgets. Besides gadgets involved with industrial production, his inventions include:\n\n*The [[Ski jumping sling]]\n*A [[Boat ski]] (to alleviate *bumps* in aquaplaning boat)\n*A self-extinguishing, one-size-fits-all [[candlestick]].\n\nFor a period of time Pasanen was also obsessed with inventing a [[perpetual motion]] device. His crude drawings of it also appeared in his sketchs shows and films. Once he became convinced that perpetual motion is theoretically impossible, he openly ridiculed himself in the character of ''H\u00e4rski Hartikainen'' in one of the Uuno Turhapuro movies.\n\n==Personal life==\nSpede married Pirjo Vainim\u00e4ki, the leading lady of his first starring picture ''[[X-Paroni]]'', in 1965. Spede's first and only child, [[Pirre Pasanen]], was born later that year. The couple separated in the early 1980s and divorced later.\n\nA family private individual, Pasanen did not discuss his personal relationships in public. He had a long relationship with the 1976 [[Miss Europe]], [[Riitta V\u00e4is\u00e4nen]]. Pasanen valued loyalty and friendship, and even after separation, kept employing and financially supporting previous companions. During and after relationships, he vouchsafed confidentiality and privacy for all involved in his private life. His good relations with the media might have helped with this.\n\nPasanen's nickname \"Spede\" came from an earlier nickname \"Speedy\", referring to his prowess as an [[ice hockey]] player during his childhood.<ref>Toiviainen, Sakari: [http://www.kava.fi/elavan-kuvan-museo/arkiston-aarteet/memoriam/kotimaiset-henkilot/spede-pasanen Spede Pasanen].

Accessed on 10 September 2012.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn 7 September 2001 Pasanen was playing a round of golf at the Sarfvik golf course in Kirkkonummi, Finland. At the 9th hole he began to feel ill and was taken to the club house, where his condition rapidly deteriorated. Despite resuscitation by a doctor and a rapid response of emergency medical services Pasanen died. His death was attributed to advanced [[coronary artery disease]].<ref>[https://www.is.fi/viihde/art-2000001253015.html Speden dramaattiset viime hetket \u2013 \u201dPertti pelk\u00e4si l\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4reit\u00e4\u201d] Iltasanomat.fi 2016-09-03]</ref>\n\n==Notable collaborators==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ere Kokkonen]]\n* [[Jukka Virtanen (director)|Jukka Virtanen]]\n* [[Simo Salminen]]\n* [[Vesa-Matti Loiri]]\n* [[Leo Jokela]]\n* [[Riitta V\u00e4is\u00e4nen]] \n* [[Pentti Siimes]]\n* [[Olavi Ahonen]]\n* [[Juhani Kumpulainen]]\n* [[Hannele Lauri]]\n* [[Marita Nordberg]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n=== Writer, director or producer ===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[X-Paroni]]'' (directed with [[Jaakko Pakkasvirta]], 1964), in English ''The X-baron''\n* ''[[Millipilleri]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[P\u00e4hk\u00e4hullu Suomi]]'' (1967), in English ''The nutty Finland''\n* ''[[Noin seitsem\u00e4n veljest\u00e4]]'' (1968), in English ''About seven Brothers''\n* ''[[N\u00e4k\u00f6radiomiehen ihmeelliset siekailut]]'' (1969)\n* ''[[Leikkikalugangsteri]]'' (1969), in English ''The Toy Gangster''\n* ''[[Pohjan t\u00e4hteet]]'' (1969)\n* ''Jussi Pussi'' (1970)\n* ''[[Speedy Gonzales \u2013 noin 7 veljeksen poika]]'' (1970)\n* ''[[Saatanan radikaalit]]'' (1971) (Producer only)\n* ''Kahdeksas veljes'' (1971), in English ''The Eighth Brother''\n* ''[[Hirtt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6m\u00e4t]]'' (1971)\n* ''[[Uuno Turhapuro (film)|Uuno Turhapuro]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Viu-hah hah-taja]]'' (1974)\n* ''[[Professori Uuno D.G.

It was partly formed for the first time as a standard [[Red Army]] rifle division a few months after the German invasion, but the formation process appears to have been abandoned and the unit was never assigned to the front. A second formation began in April 1942 and was completed on June 16, after which it was sent to the [[Kalinin Front]]. Assigned to [[43rd Army (Soviet Union)|43rd Army]], it remained in that Army until November 1944, and in that Front (renamed [[1st Baltic Front]]) until March 1945. It ended the war in [[Leningrad Front]], helping to contain the German forces trapped in the [[Courland Pocket]]. The division had compiled a solid record of service and won a unique battle honor by this time, and was disbanded shortly after hostilities ended.\n\n== 1st Formation ==\nThe 306th Rifle Division began forming in September 1941 in the [[Moscow Military District]]. Very little is known about this formation:{{quotation|\"Twenty other divisions were formed in September 1941 in various locations (table 5.21). Very few data have been found on the last seven divisions [including the 306th] formed in September. These divisions were never assigned to a frontline unit. They may have been used on the Turkish border, in Iran, or in the Far East.\"<ref>Walter S. Dunn, Jr., ''Stalin's Keys to Victory'', Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, pp. 81\u201382</ref>}}\n\n== 2nd Formation ==\nThe second 306th Rifle Division began forming in April 1942 in the Moscow Military District,<ref>Dunn, ''Stalin's Keys to Victory'', p. 111</ref> and had its first commander, Lt. Col. Andrei Grigorevich Frolenkov, assigned on June 16.<ref>Charles C. Sharp, ''\"Red Swarm\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X'', 1996, p. 115. Sharp states that an unknown rifle brigade was used as a cadre, while Dunn states that no cadre was used.</ref> The division's order of battle was as follows:\n* 935th Rifle Regiment\n* 938th Rifle Regiment\n* 992nd Rifle Regiment\n* 1043rd Artillery Regiment<ref>Sharp, ''\"Red Swarm\"'', p. 115</ref>\n* 429th Antitank Battalion\n* 342nd Sapper Battalion\n* 915th Signal Battalion\n* 210th Reconnaissance Company\n[[File:Soviet Major General Mikhail Ivanovich Kucheriavenko.jpg|thumb|Postwar portrait of Kucheryavenko]]\nThe division spent an unusually long time in the process of forming up. At the end of June it was assigned to 10th Reserve Army, and Col. Stepan Ivanovich Chernyak took command on July 8, a post he would hold until January 12, 1943. Instead of being shipped south along with the rest of what became the [[5th Shock Army]], it was moved in August to join 43rd Army, still in the [[Reserve of the Supreme High Command]]. In September, that Army was assigned to Kalinin Front. The 306th remained in that Army and Front for an unusually long time. During October 1942 the division, along with several others of its Army, was on notice to prepare to join in the planned second stage of [[Operation Mars]]; in the event this did not take place because the first stage was unsuccessful.<ref>David M. Glantz, ''After Stalingrad'', Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 51, 53, 473n.18</ref> Following two previous changes in command (including one brief stint by Col. Mikhail Ivanovich Kucheryavenko in March 1943) the divisional command passed to Col. Georgii Matveevich Kostik on March 27, 1943, and he would remain in this position until April 19, 1944. In September 1943, the 306th was assigned to the [[91st Rifle Corps]].<ref>Sharp, ''\"Red Swarm\"'', p. 115</ref>\n\n===Smolensk and Vitebsk Offensives===\nIn that same month the division was participating in the [[Battle of Smolensk (1943)|offensive to liberate Smolensk]]. On September 13 the 306th, and its corps-mate, the [[179th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|179th Rifle Division]], attacked the left flank of the German [[256th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|256th Infantry Division]] and made a small breakthrough at Bedenki. This was countered by the few local reserves available. The next day the 306th liberated the fortified village of [[Ribshevo]].<ref>Robert Forczyk, ''Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2019, Kindle ed.</ref> In recognition of this success, on September 15 the division was uniquely granted that name as an honorific:{{quotation|\"RIBSHEVO \u2013 ...306th Rifle Division (Colonel Kucheryavenko, Mikhail Ivanovich)... By order of the Supreme High Command of 19 September 1943 and a commendation in Moscow, the troops who participated in the battles for the liberation of Ribshevo are given a salute of 12 artillery salvoes from 124 guns.\"<ref>http://www.soldat.ru/spravka/freedom/1-ssr-5.html. Retrieved August 7, 2017.</ref>}}In early November, 43rd and [[39th Army (Soviet Union)|39th Armies]] were ordered to concentrate north of the Smolensk \u2013 [[Vitebsk]] railroad and highway in preparation for a new offensive against the latter city to begin on the 8th. 91st Corps was in first echelon on the right side of its Army's attack frontage. The two armies had about a five-fold superiority in infantry, in spite of their rifle divisions (including the 306th) being at about half their authorized strength. The assault made good initial progress; 43rd Army hit the junction of German [[14th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|14th]] and [[206th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|206th Infantry Divisions]] of [[VI Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|VI Army Corps]] south of Ianovichi, about 24&nbsp;km due east of Vitebsk, and tore a gaping hole through their defenses. On the following day the combined assault of both armies had produced a 10&nbsp;km-wide breach, and by evening the lead elements of the attackers had reached Poddube, just 10&nbsp;km from the inner defense lines of Vitebsk proper, and the defensive fronts of both German divisions were in shambles. However, enemy reserves managed to contain 43rd Army's advance at this point on November 11, and by the 17th the Soviet assault had expired in exhaustion.<ref>Glantz, ''Battle for Belorussia'', University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 141\u201343</ref>\n\nA further effort towards Vitebsk began on December 19. In this assault, the 306th was in second echelon of its Corps, behind 179th and 270th Rifle Divisions. By the end of the day the enemy had been driven back up to 3&nbsp;km on an 8&nbsp;km front, and the next day the division was committed into this breach, and made a further advance of up to 2&nbsp;km in heavy fighting, but German reserves again intervened, and although the Soviet forces managed to reach the road between Vitebsk and Surazh on a 10&nbsp;km sector before December 23, the offensive had to be once again shut down. Yet another assault began on that date. In this, 91st Corps acted in a supporting role to 39th and [[33rd Army (Soviet Union)|33rd Armies]] by once again attacking the 14th Infantry's positions. The 306th was in the first echelon alongside the 270th in a sector between Kovalie and Piatiletna, backed by the 179th, the remaining vehicles of two tank brigades, and a motorized infantry brigade. The attack penetrated to within 2&nbsp;km south of the Vitebsk-Surazh road, and along with advances on other sectors forced the German [[LIII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|LIII Army Corps]] to withdraw to new defenses even closer to Vitebsk.<ref>Glantz, ''Belorussia'', pp. 234\u201335, 291\u201393, 296\u201397</ref>\n\n===Operation Bagration===\nIn February 1944, the division was reassigned to [[1st Rifle Corps]], and it was in this Corps at the start of [[Vitebsk\u2013Orsha Offensive|Operation Bagration]]. Following a very heavy artillery barrage lasting 20 minutes at dawn on June 22, assault companies of the division, in concert with those of six other divisions, attacked the positions of the German [[252nd Infantry Division]] and [[Corps Detachment D]] on a 20&nbsp;km front, breaking through to the second defense line by noon. By evening an armored group supported by the 306th and two other rifle divisions had crossed the Obol River and were pushing southwest towards the [[Vitebsk]] \u2013 [[Polotsk]] rail line, having advanced 7&nbsp;km during the day. The following day the division assisted in the envelopment of Corps Detachment D's positions in Shumilino and forced a crossing of the [[Western Dvina River|Dvina River]] by evening. From here, 1st Rifle Corps was ordered westward, and reached [[Beshenkovichi]] by the end of June 25. By the 27th it had reached [[Lepel]], against scattered German resistance.<ref>Dunn, ''Soviet Blitzkrieg'', Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 95, 100, 102, 104, 106, 109</ref>\n\nAlong with its Army, in the following months the 306th advanced into the \"Baltic Gap\" between Army Groups North and Center, driving towards [[Riga]] and the Baltic coast and trapping the remains of Army Group North in the Courland Pocket.

It was partly formed for the first time as a standard [[Red Army]] rifle division a few months after the German invasion, but the formation process appears to have been abandoned and the unit was never assigned to the front. A second formation began in April 1942 and was completed on June 16, after which it was sent to the [[Kalinin Front]]. Assigned to [[43rd Army (Soviet Union)|43rd Army]], it remained in that Army until November 1944, and in that Front (renamed [[1st Baltic Front]]) until March 1945. It ended the war in [[Leningrad Front]], helping to contain the German forces trapped in the [[Courland Pocket]]. The division had compiled a solid record of service and won a unique battle honor by this time, and was disbanded shortly after hostilities ended.\n\n== 1st Formation ==\nThe 306th Rifle Division began forming in September 1941 in the [[Moscow Military District]]. Very little is known about this formation:{{quotation|\"Twenty other divisions were formed in September 1941 in various locations (table 5.21). Very few data have been found on the last seven divisions [including the 306th] formed in September. These divisions were never assigned to a frontline unit. They may have been used on the Turkish border, in Iran, or in the Far East.\"<ref>Walter S.

Col. Andrei Grigorevich Frolenkov, assigned on June 16.<ref>Charles C. Sharp, ''\"Red Swarm\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X'', 1996, p. 115.

At the end of June it was assigned to 10th Reserve Army, and Col. Stepan Ivanovich Chernyak took command on July 8, a post he would hold until January 12, 1943. Instead of being shipped south along with the rest of what became the [[5th Shock Army]], it was moved in August to join 43rd Army, still in the [[Reserve of the Supreme High Command]]. In September, that Army was assigned to Kalinin Front. The 306th remained in that Army and Front for an unusually long time. During October 1942 the division, along with several others of its Army, was on notice to prepare to join in the planned second stage of [[Operation Mars]]; in the event this did not take place because the first stage was unsuccessful.<ref>David M. Glantz, ''After Stalingrad'', Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 51, 53, 473n.18</ref> Following two previous changes in command (including one brief stint by Col. Mikhail Ivanovich Kucheryavenko in March 1943) the divisional command passed to Col. Georgii Matveevich Kostik on March 27, 1943, and he would remain in this position until April 19, 1944. In September 1943, the 306th was assigned to the [[91st Rifle Corps]].<ref>Sharp, ''\"Red Swarm\"'', p. 115</ref>\n\n===Smolensk and Vitebsk Offensives===\nIn that same month the division was participating in the [[Battle of Smolensk (1943)|offensive to liberate Smolensk]]. On September 13 the 306th, and its corps-mate, the [[179th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|179th Rifle Division]], attacked the left flank of the German [[256th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|256th Infantry Division]] and made a small breakthrough at Bedenki. This was countered by the few local reserves available. The next day the 306th liberated the fortified village of [[Ribshevo]].<ref>Robert Forczyk, ''Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2019, Kindle ed.</ref> In recognition of this success, on September 15 the division was uniquely granted that name as an honorific:{{quotation|\"RIBSHEVO \u2013 ...306th Rifle Division (Colonel Kucheryavenko, Mikhail Ivanovich)...

Retrieved August 7, 2017.</ref>}}In early November, 43rd and [[39th Army (Soviet Union)|39th Armies]] were ordered to concentrate north of the Smolensk \u2013 [[Vitebsk]] railroad and highway in preparation for a new offensive against the latter city to begin on the 8th. 91st Corps was in first echelon on the right side of its Army's attack frontage. The two armies had about a five-fold superiority in infantry, in spite of their rifle divisions (including the 306th) being at about half their authorized strength. The assault made good initial progress; 43rd Army hit the junction of German [[14th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|14th]] and [[206th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|206th Infantry Divisions]] of [[VI Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|VI Army Corps]] south of Ianovichi, about 24km due east of Vitebsk, and tore a gaping hole through their defenses. On the following day the combined assault of both armies had produced a 10km-wide breach, and by evening the lead elements of the attackers had reached Poddube, just 10km from the inner defense lines of Vitebsk proper, and the defensive fronts of both German divisions were in shambles. However, enemy reserves managed to contain 43rd Army's advance at this point on November 11, and by the 17th the Soviet assault had expired in exhaustion.<ref>Glantz, ''Battle for Belorussia'', University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 141\u201343</ref>\n\nA further effort towards Vitebsk began on December 19. In this assault, the 306th was in second echelon of its Corps, behind 179th and 270th Rifle Divisions. By the end of the day the enemy had been driven back up to 3km on an 8km front, and the next day the division was committed into this breach, and made a further advance of up to 2km in heavy fighting, but German reserves again intervened, and although the Soviet forces managed to reach the road between Vitebsk and Surazh on a 10km sector before December 23, the offensive had to be once again shut down. Yet another assault began on that date. In this, 91st Corps acted in a supporting role to 39th and [[33rd Army (Soviet Union)|33rd Armies]] by once again attacking the 14th Infantry's positions. The 306th was in the first echelon alongside the 270th in a sector between Kovalie and Piatiletna, backed by the 179th, the remaining vehicles of two tank brigades, and a motorized infantry brigade. The attack penetrated to within 2km south of the Vitebsk-Surazh road, and along with advances on other sectors forced the German [[LIII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|LIII Army Corps]] to withdraw to new defenses even closer to Vitebsk.<ref>Glantz, ''Belorussia'', pp. 234\u201335, 291\u201393, 296\u201397</ref>\n\n===Operation Bagration===\nIn February 1944, the division was reassigned to [[1st Rifle Corps]], and it was in this Corps at the start of [[Vitebsk\u2013Orsha Offensive|Operation Bagration]]. Following a very heavy artillery barrage lasting 20 minutes at dawn on June 22, assault companies of the division, in concert with those of six other divisions, attacked the positions of the German [[252nd Infantry Division]] and [[Corps Detachment D]] on a 20&nbsp;km front, breaking through to the second defense line by noon. By evening an armored group supported by the 306th and two other rifle divisions had crossed the Obol River and were pushing southwest towards the [[Vitebsk]] \u2013 [[Polotsk]] rail line, having advanced 7&nbsp;km during the day. The following day the division assisted in the envelopment of Corps Detachment D's positions in Shumilino and forced a crossing of the [[Western Dvina River|Dvina River]] by evening. From here, 1st Rifle Corps was ordered westward, and reached [[Beshenkovichi]] by the end of June 25.
