Ultimately, his cowardice causes Wilbur's own accidental death.<ref>\"Cheyenne\", ''[[The Restless Gun]]'', [[DVD]], Timeless Media Group.</ref> Earlier that year, he had played \"Sageman\", a wizened mystic, in the 1957 ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' episode \"Shoot for the Moon\".<ref>{{cite web|title=''Father Knows Best'' &ndash; Shoot for the Moon|work=[[TV Guide]]|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/father-knows-best/shoot-for-the-moon-19270/|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref> In the MGM Technicolor widescreen religious epic ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'', Dano in 1961 played the role of [[Simon Peter]].\n\nIn 1960, Dano guest starred on [[David McLean (actor)|David McLean]]'s NBC summer western series, ''[[Tate (TV series)|Tate]]''. That same year, he portrayed Lucas Frome in the episode \"Black Harvest\" on [[Don Durant]]'s [[CBS]] western, ''[[Johnny Ringo (TV series)|Johnny Ringo]]''. In 1962, he guest starred on the CBS [[anthology series]], ''[[The Lloyd Bridges Show]]''. Dano also appeared on ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' in five separate appearances from 1962\u201366 in a variety of character roles, one of the most memorable being \"Faraway MacPhail\". In 1962 Dano appeared as escaped convict Dan Molder on ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' in the episode titled \"The Brazen Bell.\" In the 1965\u20131966 season, he guest starred on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s western series ''[[The Legend of Jesse James (TV series)|The Legend of Jesse James]]''. He played an ex-con who became Northfork's pastor, and \"Honest Abe\" in 1961 episodes of ''[[The Rifleman]]'', an ABC Western series. He appeared on the series five times. Dano was also a frequent guest star on ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', with a total of thirteen appearances.  In season 1 (1955\u201356) of \"Gunsmoke,\" he acted in the title role of \"Obie Tater\" (No. 5 in the series) about a group of outlaws who try to force Obie, an old prospector, to give up his gold.

Disney personally selected Dano, because he felt the actor came closest to the historical descriptions of Lincoln's voice. ''Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln'' was moved to [[Disneyland]] in 1965, and Dano's vocals continued to be a part of the attraction until 2001. In 1971, his voice was also used for a revised Lincoln speech in the new \"Hall Of Presidents\" attraction at [[Magic Kingdom]] in Florida, which ran to 1993.

A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a [[head-mounted display]] with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates [[Auditory feedback|auditory]] and [[video feedback]], but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through [[haptic technology]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\"[[Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual]]\" has had the meaning of \"being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact\" since the mid-1400s.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> The term \"virtual\" has been used in the computer sense of \"not [[Reality|physically existing]] but made to appear by [[software]]\" since 1959.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\" />\n\nIn 1938, French avant-garde playwright [[Antonin Artaud]] described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the [[theatre]] as [[:fr:R\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle|\"la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle\"]] in a collection of essays, ''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et son double''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''[[The Theater and its Double]]'',<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\">[[Antonin Artaud]], ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).</ref> is the earliest published use of the term \"virtual reality\". The term \"[[artificial reality]]\", coined by [[Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger]], has been in use since the 1970s. The term \"virtual reality\" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by [[Damien Broderick]].\n\n==Forms and methods==\n{{Further|Immersion (virtual reality)|Reality\u2013virtuality continuum}}\n\nOne method by which virtual reality can be realized is [[simulation]]-based virtual reality. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver on board the impression of actually driving an actual vehicle by predicting vehicular motion caused by driver input and feeding back corresponding visual, motion and audio cues to the driver.\n\nWith [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar image]]-based virtual reality, people can join the virtual environment in the form of real video as well as an avatar. One can participate in the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] distributed virtual environment as form of either a conventional avatar or a real video. A user can select own type of participation based on the system capability.\n\nIn projector-based virtual reality, modeling of the real environment plays a vital role in various virtual reality applications, such as robot navigation, construction modeling,<ref name=\"Trend Analysis on Adoption of Virtu\"/> and airplane simulation. Image-based virtual reality systems have been gaining popularity in [[computer graphics]] and [[computer vision]] communities. In generating realistic models, it is essential to accurately register acquired 3D data; usually, a camera is used for modeling small [[Object (image processing)|objects]] at a short distance.\n\nDesktop-based virtual reality involves displaying a 3D [[virtual world]] on a regular [[Visual display unit|desktop display]] without use of any specialized [[positional tracking]] equipment. Many modern [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] video games can be used as an example, using various triggers, responsive characters, and other such interactive devices to make the user feel as though they are in a virtual world. A common criticism of this form of immersion is that there is no sense of [[peripheral vision]], limiting the user's ability to know what is happening around them.\n\n[[File:Engineers train in virtual environment to prepare for real missions 150616-Z-YF431-084.jpg|thumb|A [[Missouri National Guard]]sman looks into a VR training [[head-mounted display]] at [[Fort Leonard Wood]] in 2015]]\n\nA [[head-mounted display]] (HMD) more fully immerses the user in a virtual world. A [[virtual reality headset]] typically includes two small high resolution [[OLED]] or [[LCD]] monitors which provide separate images for each eye for [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] graphics rendering a 3D virtual world, a [[3D audio effect|binaural audio]] system, positional and rotational real-time [[Motion capture|head tracking]] for six degrees of movement. Options include [[Motion controller|motion controls]] with [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]] for physically interacting within the virtual world in an intuitive way with little to no abstraction and an [[omnidirectional treadmill]] for more freedom of physical movement allowing the user to perform locomotive motion in any direction.\n\n[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their real surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. AR systems layer virtual information over a camera [[live feed]] into a headset or [[smartglasses]] or through a [[mobile device]] giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.\n\n[[Mixed reality]] (MR) is the merging of the real world and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.\n\nA [[cyberspace]] is a networked virtual reality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace}}</ref>\n\n[[Simulated reality]] is a hypothetical virtual reality as truly immersive as the [[Real life|actual reality]], enabling an advanced [[lifelike experience]] or even [[Virternity|virtual eternity]]. It is most likely to be produced using a [[brain\u2013computer interface]] and [[quantum computer|quantum computing]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:View-Master with Reel.jpg|thumb|[[View-Master]], a stereoscopic visual simulator, was introduced in 1939|alt=]]\n\nThe exact origins of virtual reality are disputed, partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro | title=Seeing is Believing: The State of Virtual Reality | author=Matthew Schnipper | publisher= The Verge | access-date= 7 March 2017}}</ref> The development of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in Renaissance Europe created convincing depictions of spaces that did not exist, in what has been referred to as the \"multiplying of artificial worlds\".<ref name=\"Baltru\u0161aitis 1977\">{{cite book |last1=Baltru\u0161aitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N.

Antonin Artaud took the view that illusion was not distinct from reality, advocating that spectators at a play should suspend disbelief and regard the drama on stage as reality.<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\" /> The first references to the more modern concept of virtual reality came from [[science fiction]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[Morton Heilig]] wrote in the 1950s of an \"Experience Theatre\" that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the [[Sensorama]] in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a [[Machine|mechanical device]]. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the \"Telesphere Mask\" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as \"a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, [[Ivan Sutherland]], with the help of his students including [[Bob Sproull]], created what was widely considered to be the first head-mounted display system for use in immersive simulation applications.

Controllers typically use optical tracking systems (primarily [[infrared camera]]<nowiki/>s) for location and navigation, so that the user can move freely without wiring. Some input devices provide the user with [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] to the hands or other parts of the body, so that the human being can orientate himself in the three-dimensional world through haptics and sensor technology as a further sensory sensation and carry out realistic simulations. Additional haptic feedback can be obtained from omnidirectional treadmills (with which walking in virtual space is controlled by real walking movements) and vibration gloves and suits.\n\nVirtual reality cameras can be used to create [[VR photography]] using [[360-degree video|360-degree panorama videos]]. 360-degree camera shots can be mixed with virtual elements to merge reality and fiction through special effects.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} VR cameras are available in various formats, with varying numbers of lenses installed in the camera.\n\n== Applications ==\n{{Main|Applications of virtual reality}}\n\n[[File:Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin and Erisa Hines speak to members of the news media during a preview of the new Destination Mars (29712147171).jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11]] astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] previewing the ''Destination: Mars'' VR experience at the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] in 2016]]\n\nVirtual reality is most commonly used in entertainment applications such as video games and [[3D cinema]].

A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a [[head-mounted display]] with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates [[Auditory feedback|auditory]] and [[video feedback]], but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through [[haptic technology]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\"[[Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual]]\" has had the meaning of \"being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact\" since the mid-1400s.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> The term \"virtual\" has been used in the computer sense of \"not [[Reality|physically existing]] but made to appear by [[software]]\" since 1959.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\" />\n\nIn 1938, French avant-garde playwright [[Antonin Artaud]] described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the [[theatre]] as [[:fr:R\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle|\"la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle\"]] in a collection of essays, ''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et son double''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''[[The Theater and its Double]]'',<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\">[[Antonin Artaud]], ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).</ref> is the earliest published use of the term \"virtual reality\". The term \"[[artificial reality]]\", coined by [[Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger]], has been in use since the 1970s. The term \"virtual reality\" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by [[Damien Broderick]].\n\n==Forms and methods==\n{{Further|Immersion (virtual reality)|Reality\u2013virtuality continuum}}\n\nOne method by which virtual reality can be realized is [[simulation]]-based virtual reality. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver on board the impression of actually driving an actual vehicle by predicting vehicular motion caused by driver input and feeding back corresponding visual, motion and audio cues to the driver.\n\nWith [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar image]]-based virtual reality, people can join the virtual environment in the form of real video as well as an avatar. One can participate in the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] distributed virtual environment as form of either a conventional avatar or a real video. A user can select own type of participation based on the system capability.\n\nIn projector-based virtual reality, modeling of the real environment plays a vital role in various virtual reality applications, such as robot navigation, construction modeling,<ref name=\"Trend Analysis on Adoption of Virtu\"/> and airplane simulation. Image-based virtual reality systems have been gaining popularity in [[computer graphics]] and [[computer vision]] communities. In generating realistic models, it is essential to accurately register acquired 3D data; usually, a camera is used for modeling small [[Object (image processing)|objects]] at a short distance.\n\nDesktop-based virtual reality involves displaying a 3D [[virtual world]] on a regular [[Visual display unit|desktop display]] without use of any specialized [[positional tracking]] equipment. Many modern [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] video games can be used as an example, using various triggers, responsive characters, and other such interactive devices to make the user feel as though they are in a virtual world. A common criticism of this form of immersion is that there is no sense of [[peripheral vision]], limiting the user's ability to know what is happening around them.\n\n[[File:Engineers train in virtual environment to prepare for real missions 150616-Z-YF431-084.jpg|thumb|A [[Missouri National Guard]]sman looks into a VR training [[head-mounted display]] at [[Fort Leonard Wood]] in 2015]]\n\nA [[head-mounted display]] (HMD) more fully immerses the user in a virtual world. A [[virtual reality headset]] typically includes two small high resolution [[OLED]] or [[LCD]] monitors which provide separate images for each eye for [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] graphics rendering a 3D virtual world, a [[3D audio effect|binaural audio]] system, positional and rotational real-time [[Motion capture|head tracking]] for six degrees of movement. Options include [[Motion controller|motion controls]] with [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]] for physically interacting within the virtual world in an intuitive way with little to no abstraction and an [[omnidirectional treadmill]] for more freedom of physical movement allowing the user to perform locomotive motion in any direction.\n\n[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their real surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. AR systems layer virtual information over a camera [[live feed]] into a headset or [[smartglasses]] or through a [[mobile device]] giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.\n\n[[Mixed reality]] (MR) is the merging of the real world and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.\n\nA [[cyberspace]] is a networked virtual reality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace}}</ref>\n\n[[Simulated reality]] is a hypothetical virtual reality as truly immersive as the [[Real life|actual reality]], enabling an advanced [[lifelike experience]] or even [[Virternity|virtual eternity]]. It is most likely to be produced using a [[brain\u2013computer interface]] and [[quantum computer|quantum computing]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:View-Master with Reel.jpg|thumb|[[View-Master]], a stereoscopic visual simulator, was introduced in 1939|alt=]]\n\nThe exact origins of virtual reality are disputed, partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro | title=Seeing is Believing: The State of Virtual Reality | author=Matthew Schnipper | publisher= The Verge | access-date= 7 March 2017}}</ref> The development of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in Renaissance Europe created convincing depictions of spaces that did not exist, in what has been referred to as the \"multiplying of artificial worlds\".<ref name=\"Baltru\u0161aitis 1977\">{{cite book |last1=Baltru\u0161aitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N.

Antonin Artaud took the view that illusion was not distinct from reality, advocating that spectators at a play should suspend disbelief and regard the drama on stage as reality.<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\" /> The first references to the more modern concept of virtual reality came from [[science fiction]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[Morton Heilig]] wrote in the 1950s of an \"Experience Theatre\" that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the [[Sensorama]] in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a [[Machine|mechanical device]]. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the \"Telesphere Mask\" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as \"a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, [[Ivan Sutherland]], with the help of his students including [[Bob Sproull]], created what was widely considered to be the first head-mounted display system for use in immersive simulation applications. It was primitive both in terms of [[user interface]] and visual realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling. The graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple [[wire-frame model]] rooms. The formidable appearance of the device inspired its name, [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|The Sword of Damocles]].\n\n==== 1970\u20131990 ====\nThe virtual reality industry mainly provided VR devices for medical, flight simulation, automobile industry design, and military training purposes from 1970 to 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|title=National Center for Supercomputing Applications: History|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821054144/http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|archivedate=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nDavid Em became the first artist to produce navigable virtual worlds at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) from 1977 to 1984.<ref name=\"Creative Computing March 1982\">{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Ted|title=Report on Siggraph '81|journal=Creative Computing|date=March 1982}}</ref> The [[Aspen Movie Map]], a crude [[virtual tour]] in which users could wander the streets of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] in one of the three modes (summer, winter, and [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]]), was created at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1978.\n\n[[File:Virtual Reality Headset Prototype.jpg|thumb|[[Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]]'s 1985 VIEW headset]]\n\nIn 1979, [[Eric Howlett]] developed the Large Expanse, Extra Perspective (LEEP) optical system.

These include the [[3d mouse|3D mouse]], the [[wired glove]], [[motion controller]]s, and [[Optical tracking instruments|optical tracking]] sensors. Controllers typically use optical tracking systems (primarily [[infrared camera]]<nowiki/>s) for location and navigation, so that the user can move freely without wiring. Some input devices provide the user with [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] to the hands or other parts of the body, so that the human being can orientate himself in the three-dimensional world through haptics and sensor technology as a further sensory sensation and carry out realistic simulations. Additional haptic feedback can be obtained from omnidirectional treadmills (with which walking in virtual space is controlled by real walking movements) and vibration gloves and suits.\n\nVirtual reality cameras can be used to create [[VR photography]] using [[360-degree video|360-degree panorama videos]]. 360-degree camera shots can be mixed with virtual elements to merge reality and fiction through special effects.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} VR cameras are available in various formats, with varying numbers of lenses installed in the camera.\n\n== Applications ==\n{{Main|Applications of virtual reality}}\n\n[[File:Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin and Erisa Hines speak to members of the news media during a preview of the new Destination Mars (29712147171).jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11]] astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] previewing the ''Destination: Mars'' VR experience at the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] in 2016]]\n\nVirtual reality is most commonly used in entertainment applications such as video games and [[3D cinema]].

One in 4,000 people, or .025%, may experience these symptoms. Since these symptoms are more common among people under the age of 20, children are advised against using VR headsets. Other problems may occur in physical interactions with one's environment.

It is first necessary to make clear the meaning of the names; they are distinct, despite the persistently held opinion in onomastic (dictionaries) and popular thought. In Spain Ignacio and I\u00f1igo are at times used interchangeably just as if they were Jacobo and Jaime. With reference to the name I\u00f1igo, it is fitting to give some essential notions to eliminate ambiguities and help understand what follows. This name first appears on the Ascoli brome (dated November 18, 90 BC), in a list of Spanish knights belonging to a Turma salluitana or Saragossan. It speaks of Elandus Enneces f[ilius], and according to Men\u00e9ndez Pidal the final \u00abs\u00bb is the \u00abz\u00bb of Spanish patronymics, and could be nothing other than Elando I\u00f1iguez. It is an ancestral Hispanic name. Ignacio, on the other hand, is a Latin name. In classical Latin there is Egnatius with an initial E. It appears only twice with an initial I (Ignatius) in the sixty volumes of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum. This late Latin and Greek form prevailed. In the classical period Egnatius was used as a nomen (gentilitial name) and not as a praenomen (first name) or cognomen (surname), except in very rare cases. (...) The most important conclusion, perhaps unexpected, but not unknown, is that St. Ignatius did not change his name. That is to say, he did not intend to change it. What he did was to adopt for France and Italy a name which he believed was a simple variant of his own, and which was more acceptable among foreigners.... If he had remained in Spain, he would have, without doubt, remained I\u00f1igo.}}</ref>\n\n\u00cd\u00f1igo was the youngest of thirteen children.

Hospitals in those days were run by religious orders, and the reading material available to bedridden patients tended to be selected from scripture or devotional literature.

This work took Ludolph forty years to complete.</ref> This book would influence his whole life, inspiring him to devote himself to God and follow the example of [[Francis of Assisi]] and other great monks. It also inspired his method of meditation, since Ludolph proposes that the reader place himself mentally at the scene of the Gospel story, visualising the crib at the Nativity, etc. This type of meditation, known as Simple Contemplation, was the basis for the method that St. Ignatius would promote in his ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]''.<ref>Sr Mary Immaculate Bodenstedt, \"The Vita Christi of Ludolphus the Carthusian\", a Dissertation, Washington: Catholic University of America Press 1944 British Library Catalogue No. Ac2692.y/29.(16).</ref><ref>\"The Vita Christi\" by Charles Abbot Conway ''Analecta Cartusiana'' 34</ref><ref>\"Ludolph's Life of Christ\" by Father Henry James Coleridge in ''The Month'' Vol. 17 (New Series VI) July\u2013December 1872, pp. 337\u2013370</ref>\n\nAside from dreaming about imitating the saints in his readings, \u00cd\u00f1igo was still wandering off in his mind about what \"he would do in service to his king and in honor of the royal lady he was in love with\".

It is first necessary to make clear the meaning of the names; they are distinct, despite the persistently held opinion in onomastic (dictionaries) and popular thought. In Spain Ignacio and I\u00f1igo are at times used interchangeably just as if they were Jacobo and Jaime. With reference to the name I\u00f1igo, it is fitting to give some essential notions to eliminate ambiguities and help understand what follows. This name first appears on the Ascoli brome (dated November 18, 90 BC), in a list of Spanish knights belonging to a Turma salluitana or Saragossan. It speaks of Elandus Enneces f[ilius], and according to Men\u00e9ndez Pidal the final \u00abs\u00bb is the \u00abz\u00bb of Spanish patronymics, and could be nothing other than Elando I\u00f1iguez. It is an ancestral Hispanic name. Ignacio, on the other hand, is a Latin name. In classical Latin there is Egnatius with an initial E. It appears only twice with an initial I (Ignatius) in the sixty volumes of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum. This late Latin and Greek form prevailed. In the classical period Egnatius was used as a nomen (gentilitial name) and not as a praenomen (first name) or cognomen (surname), except in very rare cases. (...) The most important conclusion, perhaps unexpected, but not unknown, is that St. Ignatius did not change his name. That is to say, he did not intend to change it. What he did was to adopt for France and Italy a name which he believed was a simple variant of his own, and which was more acceptable among foreigners.... If he had remained in Spain, he would have, without doubt, remained I\u00f1igo.}}</ref>\n\n\u00cd\u00f1igo was the youngest of thirteen children.

It also inspired his method of meditation, since Ludolph proposes that the reader place himself mentally at the scene of the Gospel story, visualising the crib at the Nativity, etc. This type of meditation, known as Simple Contemplation, was the basis for the method that St. Ignatius would promote in his ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]''.<ref>Sr Mary Immaculate Bodenstedt, \"The Vita Christi of Ludolphus the Carthusian\", a Dissertation, Washington: Catholic University of America Press 1944 British Library Catalogue No. Ac2692.y/29.(16).</ref><ref>\"The Vita Christi\" by Charles Abbot Conway ''Analecta Cartusiana'' 34</ref><ref>\"Ludolph's Life of Christ\" by Father Henry James Coleridge in ''The Month'' Vol. 17 (New Series VI) July\u2013December 1872, pp. 337\u2013370</ref>\n\nAside from dreaming about imitating the saints in his readings, \u00cd\u00f1igo was still wandering off in his mind about what \"he would do in service to his king and in honor of the royal lady he was in love with\".

Besides the Olympic career of the Soling the boat is used for International and local [[regattas]] as well as for [[Sailing#Recreational sailing|recreational sailing]]. The Soling is managed by the [[International Soling Association]] under auspician of [[World Sailing|World Sailing/ISAF/IYRU]] since 1968.\n\nThe Soling is a strong boat designed for any wind and sea condition by [[Jan Herman Linge]] from [[Norway]] in 1964.<ref name=\"History1970\" /> The boats are [[One-Design#Sailing|one-design]] originating from an authorized single [[Molding (process)|plug and mould]] system and made of [[fiberglas]] This together with a strikt set of class rules makes competition possible on a \"[[level playing field]]\".<ref name=\"Classrules\" /> Solings last long. Those boats produced in the early days are still in competition today (more than 50 years after being built)! {{Quote\n|text=At the 2019 [[North American Championship]] the 5th place was taken by the German team sailing a refurbished Soling build in 1968.<ref name=\"NAC2019\"/>}}\n\nCharacteristic for the Soling is the droop-hiking technique.\n[[File:Silver Soling 2018 Vintage Yachting Games.jpg|thumb|left|Droop-hiking technique demonstrated by middleman.]]\n==History of the Soling <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /><ref name=\"WorldSailing\" />==\n{| {{Table}}\n! Year !! Status !! Description\n|-\n! 1961\n| [[World Sailing|IYRU]] seeks new classes as companion/complement for the Olympic classes\n| The search was for four classes:\n* A companion class for the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]]\n* A complementary class to the [[Star (keelboat)|Star]]\n* A complementary class to the [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] and [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]]\n* A [[catamaran]]\n|-\n! 1963\n| Announcement from [[World Sailing|The Class Policy Committee]] of the IYRU\n| After the announcement, [[Yachting (magazine)|Yachting]] started to gather design sketches for a three persons keelboat to be used in a presentation at the November IYRU meeting. Specs were not explicitly given however the boat should be a \"wholesome boat capable of being sailed from port to port in open water\". What IYRU wants is a nice compromise between maximum speed and maximum seaworthiness stated Yachting. The design of the Soling was made.\n|-\n! 1965\n| A prototype of the Soling was ready and tested\n| After [[Jan Herman Linge]] and [[Finn Ferner]] were satisfied with the prototype (in wood) it was transformed into an plug to create a mould for production in [[Fiberglass]]. At the IYRU November meeting trials for a new 3 persons keelboat were scheduled for 1966. During the winter of 1965/66 the first five fiberglass Soling's were built by Linge.\n|-\n! 1966\n| 1st Trials at [[Kiel]]\n| Spring was used to test the five Solings. The trials were set for Kiel specially to test and compare the entries in heavy weather. The most races were won by an wooden [[Etchells|Shillalah]]. After the trials two entries were recommended by the judges, The Shillalah and, however shorter than the specified minimum length, the Soling. In November the IYRU decided that further trials would be held in [[Travem\u00fcnde]] the following year.\n|-\n! 1967\n| 2nd Trials at [[Travem\u00fcnde]]\n| Some sixty boats were produced, sold and sailed in [[Scandinavia]] as a local class even before the trials took place. Trials were held with some new boats, an fiberglass Shillalah II and the Soling plus an [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]] and [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] for speed reference. After the trials the Soling alone was recommended to the IYRU. This passed through IYRY unanimously in November and the Soling became an International class. In 1974 Shillalah II also got the International class status. Licensed builders were attracted. The [[International Soling Association|International Soling Association (ISA)]] was established. The first president of the ISA became [[Eggert Benzon]] from Denmark.\n|-\n! 1968\n| Olympic class\n| The Olympic status for the Soling arrived after the [[Sailing at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]]. IYRU decided that the 5.5 Metre had to make place for the Soling in the [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]]. Meanwhile, over 300 Solings were built in [[Norway]], Denmark, the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and more countries would follow. The first [[Soling European Championship]] was held in [[Skovshoved]], [[Denmark]] and won by the team of [[Per Spelling]] from [[Norway]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. 75 sailors in 25 Solings did compete.\n|-\n! 1969 - 1972\n| Solings first Olympiad\n| In this period the first [[Soling World Championship]], 261 sailors in 87 Solings did compete, was won, off the coast of [[Copenhagen]], by the team of [[Paul Elvstr\u00f8m]], [[Niels Jensen]] and [[Poul Mik-Meyer]]. <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /> The team had put a lot of systems and hiking gear into their boat to make it sail faster. One of the techniques was the installation of a double bottom. This in combination with bailers made the boat self-bailing. This construction however was not legal. Before the first race of the Worlds holes had to be made into the raised floor to take away the unfair advantage. Later that year changes were made to the class rules so that racing floors/double bottoms, or as they are called officially \"Cockpit Soles\" became legal. The first winners of an [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Soling gold medal]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1972\" />, [[Buddy Melges]], [[William Allen (sailor)|Bill Allen]] and [[William Bentsen|Bill Bentsen]] <ref name=\"OS1972\" />from the [[United States]] made the boat \"Simple\" by putting a lot of the systems below deck and removing the [[winches]] and shroud tracks. Also the first [[Soling North American Championship|North American Championship]] was held on [[Lake Michigan]] in front of [[Milwaukee]]. 108 sailors in 38 Solings did compete. This event was won by the team of [[John Dane III]], [[Mark LeBlanc]] and [[John Cerise]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. At the 1972 November meeting of the IYRU the Soling was appointed as Olympic class for the 1976 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1973 - 1976\n| Solings 2nd Olympiad\n| Early 1972 [[Jack van Dyke]] from the [[United States]] became president of the ISA and he made sure that the Soling construction became under control. Then improvements were introduced one by one like hiking vests, mast steps rudders watertight compartments. The Soling became even more a one-design class. 1973 was crucial for the Soling in this respect. [[Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen]], [[Valdemar Bandolowski]] and [[Erik Hansen (sailor)|Erik Hansen]] from [[Denmark]] <ref name=\"OS1976\" />took the Gold medal during the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1976\" /> Over 2000 boats were build worldwide. Also due to the progression of the Soling the class was appointed as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1980 Olympics. \n|-\n! 1977 - 1980\n| Solings 3rd Olympiad\n| The Numbers of build Solings stayed high under the presidency of [[Geert Bakker]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. Due to the high level of National and local competition the Battle for Olympic selection became more and more intense. This meant that rules were implemented for World and continental championships to keep the large fleet events fair. The introduction of gate starts, and black flag procedures were lined out, tested and implemented. Ken Berkeley introduced [[match racing]] in the Soling. Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen, Valdemar Bandolowski and Erik Hansen <ref name=\"OS1980\" />, this time sailing under the flag of the IOC, became the [[Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympic Champions]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1980\" /> Unfortunately the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] were heavily hit by the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]]. The Soling was prolongated as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1984 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1981 - 1984\n| Solings 4th Olympiad\n| [[Ken Berkeley]], [[Australia]] took the role as ISA president in 1980. Most new boats were now built by Abbott Boats and Elvstr\u00f8m/Borresens Baadebyggeri with a few but fast exceptions from Bianchi & Cecchi and Bootswerft Leonard Mader. Major champions were held in North America, Europe and Australia. The level of competition remained very high. In 1983 [[Karl Heist]] from [[Germany]] became president of the ISA. The [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1984\" />, [[United States]] were won by the team of [[Robbie Haines]], [[Edward Trevelyan|Ed Trevelyan]] and [[Rod Davis (sailor)|Rod Davis]] <ref name=\"OS1984\" /> from the United States. This event was struck by the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott]]. Again, the Soling kept its Olympic status for the 1988 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1985 - 1988\n| Solings 5th Olympiad\n| [[Karl Heist]] had two major objectives for his presidency: First he wanted a large Soling event in Eastern Europe. He succeeded in this by having the 1985 [[Soling European Championship]] held in [[Balatonf\u00fcred]], [[Hungary]] and the 1986 Europeans in [[Warnem\u00fcnde]], [[East-Germany]]. The second objective, bringing the operational cost of the Soling down by reducing the number of sails during a championship, took more time. This rule was effectuated in March 1989. <ref name=\"AmendmentGuide1989\" /> This rule change reduced the number of mainsails from 2 to 1 and the number of large spinnakers also back from 2 to 1. Shroud tracks were re-introduced on Solings. The [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] were held in [[Busan]], [[Korea]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1988\" /> The Gold medals were won by the East Germany team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcmann]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]]. <ref name=\"OS1988\" /> The Soling status was prolonged as for the 1992 Olympics as the Fleet/Match racing class. In 1987 Sam Merrick became president of the ISA. In this period much was dune in order to make the Soling more unsinkable by [[Uli Strohschneider]] from [[Austria]].\n|-\n! 1989 - 1992\n| Solings 6th Olympiad\n| This period started with a failed World Championship. This was sailed in Balatonf\u00fcred, Hungary. On the first day there were heavy winds (up to 100km/h), specially during the starting procedure. Out of 73 starters 43 made it to the first mark and only 29 boats made it to the finish! Many masts broke. NO BOATS SUNK!!!! in these extreme conditions. The next days there was hardly any wind. Only 4 races were completed, five are needed to constitute a championship. <ref name=\"SolingSailing1989-2\" /> [[Sam Merrick]] was elected president in 1987. He made sure that although Match racing was introduced for the 1992 Olympics Fleet racing remained paramount so the Fleet/Match race was introduced at the [[Sailing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]]. Gold was won by the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Jesper Seier]] and [[Steen Secher]]. <ref name=\"OS1992\" /> This Fleet/Match race event was successful and so the Soling remained an Olympic class for another 4 years. Stuart Walker became president in 1991.\n|-\n! 1993 - 1996\n| Solings 7th Olympiad\n| The Soling made the choice to introduce the \"Pumping rule\" <ref name=\"ClassrulesC91\" /> as safety measure. This meant in general that the spinnaker [[Guy (sailing)|guy]] could be pumped unlimited. President [[Stuart H. Walker]] did a lot of work to keep the number of teams in the Match race phase of the Olympics to six thus keeping Fleet racing paramount. The [[Germany|German]] team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcman]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]] <ref name=\"OS1996\" /> won there second Gold medal in the Soling during the [[Sailing at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]]. The Olympic status was prolonged to 2000. \n|-\n! 1997 - 2000\n| Solings 8th Olympiad\n| [[Gy\u00f6rgy Wossala]], [[Hungary]] became ISA president in 1995. The 1997 Worlds in [[Rungsted]], [[Denmark]] did not produce enough races to constitute an valid championship due to weather conditions. Thunderstorms and large periods with no wind at all made it for the race organization impossible to get five race in. The sail plan of the Soling was modified on two points. The tolerances of the mini spinnaker were enlarged so that a more useful spinnaker could be created. Also, the top batten of the mainsail was lengthened so that profile of the top in the main could be better controlled and the lifetime of the sail was improved. Both improvements were initiated by [[Paul Davis (sailor)|Paul Davis]]. [[World Sailing|ISAF]] wanted to make Match racing more and more important at the Olympics. So for the [[Sailing at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] only 16 Solings were eligible to compete in the Fleet race phase and twelve of theme would move on to the Match race phase. The spectacular, popular and many times viewed finals <ref name=\"Youtube\" /> were between the teams of Germany and Denmark. Both teams did barely make it into the Match race phase (resp. 10 an 12 place in the Fleet race phase). Finally the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Henrik Blakskj\u00e6r]] and [[Thomas Jacobsen (sailor)|Thomas Jacobsen]] took the Gold medal. <ref name=\"OS2000\" /> During the ISAF 2000 mid-year it was decided that the Fleet/Match race event was prolonged for another four years. However, during the ISAF 2000 November meeting, the Soling was NOT re-elected as an Olympic class. There was no match racing on the Olympic agenda anymore till [[Sailing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]]. In 1999 [[Tony Claire]], [[Great Britain]] became president of the ISA.\n|-\n! 2001 - 2006\n| Post-Olympic \n| However, the publicity that was generated for the Olympic sailing event by the fleet/Match race event it disappeared from the Olympic agenda for 2004. And the Soling had to face the fact that many of her top sailors disappeared to other Olympic disciplines or quite sailing in general within a few months. Another setback of the class was that Tony Claire was severe injured during a horseback riding incident. [[Rose Hoeksema]], [[United States]] took over as president and did a good job of holding the International and National Soling sailors within the class as good as possible. Worlds and continental events were organized as usual and with sufficient participation. The third disaster struck in 2006 when the Abbott Boats ltd. [[Sarnia]], [[Canada]] went into flames. <ref name=\"Fire\" /> Borresens Baadebyggeri [[Denmark]] however started to build boats in a joint venture in [[Argentina]] to build Solings.\n|-\n! 2007 - 2015\n| Solid International Class\n| [[Johan Offermans]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] became president for an unprecedented number of 7 years! During his presidency he give much stimulants to pick up International travel again. Also, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the class were started. [[Jan Herman Linge]] Died at the age of 85 in [[Asker]], [[Norway]]. <ref name=\"LingeDies\" /> In 2014 [[Peter Hall (sailor)|Peter Hall]] took over the presidency. The 50th anniversary of the class was celebrated during the 2015 World Championship in [[Castiglione della Pescaia]], [[Italy]]. Over 135 competitors were present from 14 countries and three continents. <ref name=\"Worlds2015\" /> The first production Soling \"N 1\" was on display at the harbor site. Soling production was renewed at the [[Petticrows Boatyard]], [[United Kingdom]].\n|-\n!2016 - Now\n| Introduction on carbon spars\n| In 2017 [[Michael Dietzel]] was elected president of the ISA. In 2017 it became clear that there were no longer vendors of suitable aluminum Soling spars anymore word wide. [[Han van Veen]], The Netherlands, created and executed a plan to introduce Carbon spars for the Soling. The objective was that the new masts would be cheaper and not lighter or faster than the aluminum masts. The first masts were produced by [[Ceilidh]] <ref name=\"Carbon\" /> in The Netherlands and tested in 2018 they proved to be cheaper and equal to the original masts. The one-design of the Soling remain intact. The new mast were approved by [[World Sailing]] in 2019.

Besides the Olympic career of the Soling the boat is used for International and local [[regattas]] as well as for [[Sailing#Recreational sailing|recreational sailing]]. The Soling is managed by the [[International Soling Association]] under auspician of [[World Sailing|World Sailing/ISAF/IYRU]] since 1968.\n\nThe Soling is a strong boat designed for any wind and sea condition by [[Jan Herman Linge]] from [[Norway]] in 1964.<ref name=\"History1970\" /> The boats are [[One-Design#Sailing|one-design]] originating from an authorized single [[Molding (process)|plug and mould]] system and made of [[fiberglas]] This together with a strikt set of class rules makes competition possible on a \"[[level playing field]]\".<ref name=\"Classrules\" /> Solings last long. Those boats produced in the early days are still in competition today (more than 50 years after being built)! {{Quote\n|text=At the 2019 [[North American Championship]] the 5th place was taken by the German team sailing a refurbished Soling build in 1968.<ref name=\"NAC2019\"/>}}\n\nCharacteristic for the Soling is the droop-hiking technique.\n[[File:Silver Soling 2018 Vintage Yachting Games.jpg|thumb|left|Droop-hiking technique demonstrated by middleman.]]\n==History of the Soling <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /><ref name=\"WorldSailing\" />==\n{| {{Table}}\n! Year !! Status !! Description\n|-\n! 1961\n| [[World Sailing|IYRU]] seeks new classes as companion/complement for the Olympic classes\n| The search was for four classes:\n* A companion class for the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]]\n* A complementary class to the [[Star (keelboat)|Star]]\n* A complementary class to the [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] and [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]]\n* A [[catamaran]]\n|-\n! 1963\n| Announcement from [[World Sailing|The Class Policy Committee]] of the IYRU\n| After the announcement, [[Yachting (magazine)|Yachting]] started to gather design sketches for a three persons keelboat to be used in a presentation at the November IYRU meeting. Specs were not explicitly given however the boat should be a \"wholesome boat capable of being sailed from port to port in open water\". What IYRU wants is a nice compromise between maximum speed and maximum seaworthiness stated Yachting. The design of the Soling was made.\n|-\n! 1965\n| A prototype of the Soling was ready and tested\n| After [[Jan Herman Linge]] and [[Finn Ferner]] were satisfied with the prototype (in wood) it was transformed into an plug to create a mould for production in [[Fiberglass]]. At the IYRU November meeting trials for a new 3 persons keelboat were scheduled for 1966. During the winter of 1965/66 the first five fiberglass Soling's were built by Linge.\n|-\n! 1966\n| 1st Trials at [[Kiel]]\n| Spring was used to test the five Solings. The trials were set for Kiel specially to test and compare the entries in heavy weather. The most races were won by an wooden [[Etchells|Shillalah]]. After the trials two entries were recommended by the judges, The Shillalah and, however shorter than the specified minimum length, the Soling. In November the IYRU decided that further trials would be held in [[Travem\u00fcnde]] the following year.\n|-\n! 1967\n| 2nd Trials at [[Travem\u00fcnde]]\n| Some sixty boats were produced, sold and sailed in [[Scandinavia]] as a local class even before the trials took place. Trials were held with some new boats, an fiberglass Shillalah II and the Soling plus an [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]] and [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] for speed reference. After the trials the Soling alone was recommended to the IYRU. This passed through IYRY unanimously in November and the Soling became an International class. In 1974 Shillalah II also got the International class status. Licensed builders were attracted. The [[International Soling Association|International Soling Association (ISA)]] was established. The first president of the ISA became [[Eggert Benzon]] from Denmark.\n|-\n! 1968\n| Olympic class\n| The Olympic status for the Soling arrived after the [[Sailing at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]]. IYRU decided that the 5.5 Metre had to make place for the Soling in the [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]]. Meanwhile, over 300 Solings were built in [[Norway]], Denmark, the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and more countries would follow. The first [[Soling European Championship]] was held in [[Skovshoved]], [[Denmark]] and won by the team of [[Per Spelling]] from [[Norway]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. 75 sailors in 25 Solings did compete.\n|-\n! 1969 - 1972\n| Solings first Olympiad\n| In this period the first [[Soling World Championship]], 261 sailors in 87 Solings did compete, was won, off the coast of [[Copenhagen]], by the team of [[Paul Elvstr\u00f8m]], [[Niels Jensen]] and [[Poul Mik-Meyer]]. <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /> The team had put a lot of systems and hiking gear into their boat to make it sail faster. One of the techniques was the installation of a double bottom. This in combination with bailers made the boat self-bailing. This construction however was not legal. Before the first race of the Worlds holes had to be made into the raised floor to take away the unfair advantage. Later that year changes were made to the class rules so that racing floors/double bottoms, or as they are called officially \"Cockpit Soles\" became legal. The first winners of an [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Soling gold medal]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1972\" />, [[Buddy Melges]], [[William Allen (sailor)|Bill Allen]] and [[William Bentsen|Bill Bentsen]] <ref name=\"OS1972\" />from the [[United States]] made the boat \"Simple\" by putting a lot of the systems below deck and removing the [[winches]] and shroud tracks. Also the first [[Soling North American Championship|North American Championship]] was held on [[Lake Michigan]] in front of [[Milwaukee]]. 108 sailors in 38 Solings did compete. This event was won by the team of [[John Dane III]], [[Mark LeBlanc]] and [[John Cerise]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. At the 1972 November meeting of the IYRU the Soling was appointed as Olympic class for the 1976 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1973 - 1976\n| Solings 2nd Olympiad\n| Early 1972 [[Jack van Dyke]] from the [[United States]] became president of the ISA and he made sure that the Soling construction became under control. Then improvements were introduced one by one like hiking vests, mast steps rudders watertight compartments. The Soling became even more a one-design class. 1973 was crucial for the Soling in this respect. [[Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen]], [[Valdemar Bandolowski]] and [[Erik Hansen (sailor)|Erik Hansen]] from [[Denmark]] <ref name=\"OS1976\" />took the Gold medal during the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1976\" /> Over 2000 boats were build worldwide. Also due to the progression of the Soling the class was appointed as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1980 Olympics. \n|-\n! 1977 - 1980\n| Solings 3rd Olympiad\n| The Numbers of build Solings stayed high under the presidency of [[Geert Bakker]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. Due to the high level of National and local competition the Battle for Olympic selection became more and more intense. This meant that rules were implemented for World and continental championships to keep the large fleet events fair. The introduction of gate starts, and black flag procedures were lined out, tested and implemented. Ken Berkeley introduced [[match racing]] in the Soling. Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen, Valdemar Bandolowski and Erik Hansen <ref name=\"OS1980\" />, this time sailing under the flag of the IOC, became the [[Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympic Champions]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1980\" /> Unfortunately the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] were heavily hit by the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]]. The Soling was prolongated as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1984 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1981 - 1984\n| Solings 4th Olympiad\n| [[Ken Berkeley]], [[Australia]] took the role as ISA president in 1980. Most new boats were now built by Abbott Boats and Elvstr\u00f8m/Borresens Baadebyggeri with a few but fast exceptions from Bianchi & Cecchi and Bootswerft Leonard Mader. Major champions were held in North America, Europe and Australia. The level of competition remained very high. In 1983 [[Karl Heist]] from [[Germany]] became president of the ISA. The [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1984\" />, [[United States]] were won by the team of [[Robbie Haines]], [[Edward Trevelyan|Ed Trevelyan]] and [[Rod Davis (sailor)|Rod Davis]] <ref name=\"OS1984\" /> from the United States. This event was struck by the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott]]. Again, the Soling kept its Olympic status for the 1988 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1985 - 1988\n| Solings 5th Olympiad\n| [[Karl Heist]] had two major objectives for his presidency: First he wanted a large Soling event in Eastern Europe. He succeeded in this by having the 1985 [[Soling European Championship]] held in [[Balatonf\u00fcred]], [[Hungary]] and the 1986 Europeans in [[Warnem\u00fcnde]], [[East-Germany]]. The second objective, bringing the operational cost of the Soling down by reducing the number of sails during a championship, took more time. This rule was effectuated in March 1989. <ref name=\"AmendmentGuide1989\" /> This rule change reduced the number of mainsails from 2 to 1 and the number of large spinnakers also back from 2 to 1. Shroud tracks were re-introduced on Solings. The [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] were held in [[Busan]], [[Korea]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1988\" /> The Gold medals were won by the East Germany team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcmann]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]]. <ref name=\"OS1988\" /> The Soling status was prolonged as for the 1992 Olympics as the Fleet/Match racing class. In 1987 Sam Merrick became president of the ISA. In this period much was dune in order to make the Soling more unsinkable by [[Uli Strohschneider]] from [[Austria]].\n|-\n! 1989 - 1992\n| Solings 6th Olympiad\n| This period started with a failed World Championship. This was sailed in Balatonf\u00fcred, Hungary. On the first day there were heavy winds (up to 100km/h), specially during the starting procedure. Out of 73 starters 43 made it to the first mark and only 29 boats made it to the finish! Many masts broke. NO BOATS SUNK!!!! in these extreme conditions. The next days there was hardly any wind. Only 4 races were completed, five are needed to constitute a championship. <ref name=\"SolingSailing1989-2\" /> [[Sam Merrick]] was elected president in 1987. He made sure that although Match racing was introduced for the 1992 Olympics Fleet racing remained paramount so the Fleet/Match race was introduced at the [[Sailing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]]. Gold was won by the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Jesper Seier]] and [[Steen Secher]]. <ref name=\"OS1992\" /> This Fleet/Match race event was successful and so the Soling remained an Olympic class for another 4 years. Stuart Walker became president in 1991.\n|-\n! 1993 - 1996\n| Solings 7th Olympiad\n| The Soling made the choice to introduce the \"Pumping rule\" <ref name=\"ClassrulesC91\" /> as safety measure. This meant in general that the spinnaker [[Guy (sailing)|guy]] could be pumped unlimited. President [[Stuart H. Walker]] did a lot of work to keep the number of teams in the Match race phase of the Olympics to six thus keeping Fleet racing paramount. The [[Germany|German]] team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcman]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]] <ref name=\"OS1996\" /> won there second Gold medal in the Soling during the [[Sailing at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]]. The Olympic status was prolonged to 2000. \n|-\n! 1997 - 2000\n| Solings 8th Olympiad\n| [[Gy\u00f6rgy Wossala]], [[Hungary]] became ISA president in 1995. The 1997 Worlds in [[Rungsted]], [[Denmark]] did not produce enough races to constitute an valid championship due to weather conditions. Thunderstorms and large periods with no wind at all made it for the race organization impossible to get five race in. The sail plan of the Soling was modified on two points. The tolerances of the mini spinnaker were enlarged so that a more useful spinnaker could be created. Also, the top batten of the mainsail was lengthened so that profile of the top in the main could be better controlled and the lifetime of the sail was improved. Both improvements were initiated by [[Paul Davis (sailor)|Paul Davis]]. [[World Sailing|ISAF]] wanted to make Match racing more and more important at the Olympics. So for the [[Sailing at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] only 16 Solings were eligible to compete in the Fleet race phase and twelve of theme would move on to the Match race phase. The spectacular, popular and many times viewed finals <ref name=\"Youtube\" /> were between the teams of Germany and Denmark. Both teams did barely make it into the Match race phase (resp. 10 an 12 place in the Fleet race phase). Finally the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Henrik Blakskj\u00e6r]] and [[Thomas Jacobsen (sailor)|Thomas Jacobsen]] took the Gold medal. <ref name=\"OS2000\" /> During the ISAF 2000 mid-year it was decided that the Fleet/Match race event was prolonged for another four years. However, during the ISAF 2000 November meeting, the Soling was NOT re-elected as an Olympic class. There was no match racing on the Olympic agenda anymore till [[Sailing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]]. In 1999 [[Tony Claire]], [[Great Britain]] became president of the ISA.\n|-\n! 2001 - 2006\n| Post-Olympic \n| However, the publicity that was generated for the Olympic sailing event by the fleet/Match race event it disappeared from the Olympic agenda for 2004. And the Soling had to face the fact that many of her top sailors disappeared to other Olympic disciplines or quite sailing in general within a few months. Another setback of the class was that Tony Claire was severe injured during a horseback riding incident. [[Rose Hoeksema]], [[United States]] took over as president and did a good job of holding the International and National Soling sailors within the class as good as possible. Worlds and continental events were organized as usual and with sufficient participation. The third disaster struck in 2006 when the Abbott Boats ltd. [[Sarnia]], [[Canada]] went into flames. <ref name=\"Fire\" /> Borresens Baadebyggeri [[Denmark]] however started to build boats in a joint venture in [[Argentina]] to build Solings.\n|-\n! 2007 - 2015\n| Solid International Class\n| [[Johan Offermans]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] became president for an unprecedented number of 7 years! During his presidency he give much stimulants to pick up International travel again. Also, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the class were started. [[Jan Herman Linge]] Died at the age of 85 in [[Asker]], [[Norway]]. <ref name=\"LingeDies\" /> In 2014 [[Peter Hall (sailor)|Peter Hall]] took over the presidency. The 50th anniversary of the class was celebrated during the 2015 World Championship in [[Castiglione della Pescaia]], [[Italy]]. Over 135 competitors were present from 14 countries and three continents. <ref name=\"Worlds2015\" /> The first production Soling \"N 1\" was on display at the harbor site. Soling production was renewed at the [[Petticrows Boatyard]], [[United Kingdom]].\n|-\n!2016 - Now\n| Introduction on carbon spars\n| In 2017 [[Michael Dietzel]] was elected president of the ISA. In 2017 it became clear that there were no longer vendors of suitable aluminum Soling spars anymore word wide. [[Han van Veen]], The Netherlands, created and executed a plan to introduce Carbon spars for the Soling. The objective was that the new masts would be cheaper and not lighter or faster than the aluminum masts. The first masts were produced by [[Ceilidh]] <ref name=\"Carbon\" /> in The Netherlands and tested in 2018 they proved to be cheaper and equal to the original masts. The one-design of the Soling remain intact. The new mast were approved by [[World Sailing]] in 2019. In 2020 the Carbon boom and spinnaker pole were approved as well. <ref name=\"Classrules\" /><ref name=\"Boom\" /> In 2020 the [[Soling North American Championship]] in [[Annapolis]], [[United States]], the Friendship League Championship in [[Brazil]] and many other Soling regatta's word wide were postponed due to [[COVID-19]]. <ref name=\"COVID-19\" />\n|}\n\n==Solings Built==\nOver the years about 4500 Solings were built. About 3700 of them were registered. The growth in the late 1960s and early 1970s was high. Then it stabilized. Since 2000 hardly any boats were built. <ref name=\"Guide1970\" /><ref name=\"Guide1971\" /><ref name=\"Guide1972\" /><ref name=\"Guide1973\" /><ref name=\"Guide1974\" /><ref name=\"Guide1975\" /><ref name=\"Guide1976\" /><ref name=\"Guide1977\" /><ref name=\"Guide1978\" /><ref name=\"Guide1981\" /><ref name=\"Guide1984\" /><ref name=\"Guide1988\" /><ref name=\"Guide1992\" /><ref name=\"Guide1996\" />\n[[File:Solings Built 1965 - 2020.png|left|Soling Built between 1965 - 2020]]\n{{clear}}\nThe following 36 boat builders were over the years licensed to built Solings:\n{| {{Table}}\n! # !!

A ''filtration'' of a group <math>G</math>, is then a nested sequence <math>G_n</math> of [[normal subgroup]]s of <math>G</math> (that is, for any <math>n</math> we have <math>G_{n+1}\\subset G_n</math>). Note that this use of the word \"filtration\" corresponds to our \"descending filtration\".\n\nGiven a group <math>G</math> and a filtration <math>G_n</math>, there is a natural way to define a topology on <math>G</math>, said to be ''associated'' to the filtration. A basis for this topology is the set of all translates of subgroups appearing in the filtration, that is, a subset of <math>G</math> is defined to be open if it is a union of sets of the form <math>aG_n</math>, where <math>a\\in G</math> and <math>n</math> is a natural number.\n\nThe topology associated to a filtration on a group <math>G</math> makes <math>G</math> into a [[topological group]].\n\nThe topology associated to a filtration <math>G_n</math> on a group <math>G</math> is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] if and only if <math>\\bigcap G_n=\\{1\\}</math>.\n\nIf two filtrations <math>G_n</math> and <math>G'_n</math> are defined on a group <math>G</math>, then the identity map from <math>G</math> to <math>G</math>, where the first copy of <math>G</math> is given the <math>G_n</math>-topology and the second the <math>G'_n</math>-topology, is continuous if and only if for any <math>n</math> there is an <math>m</math> such that <math>G_m\\subset G'_n</math>, that is, if and only if the identity map is continuous at 1. In particular, the two filtrations define the same topology if and only if for any subgroup appearing in one there is a smaller or equal one appearing in the other.\n\n====Rings and modules: descending filtrations====\n\nGiven a ring <math>R</math> and an <math>R</math>-module <math>M</math>, a ''descending filtration'' of <math>M</math> is a decreasing sequence of submodules <math>M_n</math>. This is therefore a special case of the notion for groups, with the additional condition that the subgroups be submodules. The associated topology is defined as for groups.\n\nAn important special case is known as the <math>I</math>-adic topology (or <math>J</math>-adic, etc.). Let <math>R</math> be a commutative ring, and <math>I</math> an ideal of <math>R</math>.\n\nGiven an <math>R</math>-module <math>M</math>, the sequence <math>I^n M</math> of submodules of <math>M</math> forms a filtration of <math>M</math>. The ''<math>I</math>-adic topology'' on <math>M</math> is then the topology associated to this filtration. If <math>M</math> is just the ring <math>R</math> itself, we have defined the ''<math>I</math>-adic topology'' on <math>R</math>.\n\nWhen <math>R</math> is given the <math>I</math>-adic topology, <math>R</math> becomes a [[topological ring]]. If an <math>R</math>-module <math>M</math> is then given the <math>I</math>-adic topology, it becomes a [[topological module|topological <math>R</math>-module]], relative to the topology given on <math>R</math>.\n\n====Rings and modules: ascending filtrations====\n\nGiven a ring <math>R</math> and an <math>R</math>-module <math>M</math>, an ''ascending filtration'' of <math>M</math> is an increasing sequence of submodules <math>M_n</math>. In particular, if <math>R</math> is a field, then an ascending filtration of the <math>R</math>-vector space <math>M</math> is an increasing sequence of vector subspaces of <math>M</math>. [[Flag (linear algebra)|Flags]] are one important class of such filtrations.\n\n====Sets====\nA maximal filtration of a set is equivalent to an ordering (a [[permutation]]) of the set. For instance, the filtration <math>\\{0\\} \\subset \\{0,1\\} \\subset \\{0,1,2\\}</math> corresponds to the ordering <math>(0,1,2)</math>. From the point of view of the [[field with one element]], an ordering on a set corresponds to a maximal [[Flag (linear algebra)|flag]] (a filtration on a vector space), considering a set to be a vector space over the field with one element.\n\n===Measure theory===\n{{main article|Filtration (probability theory)}}\nIn [[measure theory]], in particular in [[martingale theory]] and the theory of [[stochastic process]]es, a filtration is an increasing [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] of [[sigma algebra|<math>\\sigma</math>-algebras]] on a [[measurable space]]. That is, given a measurable space <math>(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F})</math>, a filtration is a sequence of <math>\\sigma</math>-algebras <math>\\{ \\mathcal{F}_{t} \\}_{t \\geq 0}</math> with <math>\\mathcal{F}_{t} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}</math> where each <math>t</math> is a non-negative real number and\n\n:<math>t_{1} \\leq t_{2} \\implies \\mathcal{F}_{t_{1}} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_{t_{2}}.</math>\n\nThe exact range of the \"times\" ''<math>t</math>'' will usually depend on context: the set of values for <math>t</math> might be [[discrete set|discrete]] or continuous, [[bounded set|bounded]] or unbounded. For example,\n\n:<math>t \\in \\{ 0, 1, \\dots, N \\}, \\mathbb{N}_{0}, [0, T] \\mbox{ or } [0, + \\infty).</math>\n\nSimilarly, a '''filtered probability space''' (also known as a '''stochastic basis''') <math>\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right\\}_{t\\geq 0}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)</math>, is a [[probability space]] equipped with the filtration <math>\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\right\\}_{t\\geq 0}</math> of its <math>\\sigma</math>-algebra <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>. A filtered probability space is said to satisfy the ''usual conditions'' if it is [[complete measure|complete]] (i.e., <math>\\mathcal{F}_0</math> contains all <math>\\mathbb{P}</math>-[[null set]]s) and [[right-continuous]] (i.e. <math>\\mathcal{F}_t = \\mathcal{F}_{t+} := \\bigcap_{s > t} \\mathcal{F}_s</math> for all times <math>t</math>).<ref>{{cite web|title=Stochastic Processes: A very simple introduction|author=P\u00e9ter Medvegyev|date=January 2009|url=http://medvegyev.uni-corvinus.hu/St1.pdf|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Probabilities and Potential|author=Claude Dellacherie|publisher=Elsevier|year=1979|isbn=9780720407013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Filtrations and Adapted Processes|author=George Lowther|url=http://almostsure.wordpress.com/2009/11/08/filtrations-and-adapted-processes/|date=November 8, 2009|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt is also useful (in the case of an unbounded index set) to define <math>\\mathcal{F}_{\\infty}</math> as the <math>\\sigma</math>-algebra generated by the infinite union of the <math>\\mathcal{F}_{t}</math>'s, which is contained in <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}_{\\infty} = \\sigma\\left(\\bigcup_{t \\geq 0} \\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right) \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}.</math>\n\nA ''\u03c3''-algebra defines the set of events that can be measured, which in a [[probability]] context is equivalent to events that can be discriminated, or \"questions that can be answered at time <math>t</math>\". Therefore, a filtration is often used to represent the change in the set of events that can be measured, through gain or loss of [[information]]. A typical example is in [[mathematical finance]], where a filtration represents the information available up to and including each time <math>t</math>, and is more and more precise (the set of measurable events is staying the same or increasing) as more information from the evolution of the stock price becomes available.\n\n====Relation to stopping times: stopping time sigma-algebras====\n{{main article|\u03a3-Algebra of \u03c4-past}}\nLet <math>\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right\\}_{t\\geq 0}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)</math> be a filtered probability space.

A filtered probability space is said to satisfy the ''usual conditions'' if it is [[complete measure|complete]] (i.e., <math>\\mathcal{F}_0</math> contains all <math>\\mathbb{P}</math>-[[null set]]s) and [[right-continuous]] (i.e. <math>\\mathcal{F}_t = \\mathcal{F}_{t+} := \\bigcap_{s > t} \\mathcal{F}_s</math> for all times <math>t</math>).<ref>{{cite web|title=Stochastic Processes: A very simple introduction|author=P\u00e9ter Medvegyev|date=January 2009|url=http://medvegyev.uni-corvinus.hu/St1.pdf|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Probabilities and Potential|author=Claude Dellacherie|publisher=Elsevier|year=1979|isbn=9780720407013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Filtrations and Adapted Processes|author=George Lowther|url=http://almostsure.wordpress.com/2009/11/08/filtrations-and-adapted-processes/|date=November 8, 2009|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt is also useful (in the case of an unbounded index set) to define <math>\\mathcal{F}_{\\infty}</math> as the <math>\\sigma</math>-algebra generated by the infinite union of the <math>\\mathcal{F}_{t}</math>'s, which is contained in <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}_{\\infty} = \\sigma\\left(\\bigcup_{t \\geq 0} \\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right) \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}.</math>\n\nA ''\u03c3''-algebra defines the set of events that can be measured, which in a [[probability]] context is equivalent to events that can be discriminated, or \"questions that can be answered at time <math>t</math>\". Therefore, a filtration is often used to represent the change in the set of events that can be measured, through gain or loss of [[information]]. A typical example is in [[mathematical finance]], where a filtration represents the information available up to and including each time <math>t</math>, and is more and more precise (the set of measurable events is staying the same or increasing) as more information from the evolution of the stock price becomes available.\n\n====Relation to stopping times: stopping time sigma-algebras====\n{{main article|\u03a3-Algebra of \u03c4-past}}\nLet <math>\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right\\}_{t\\geq 0}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)</math> be a filtered probability space.
