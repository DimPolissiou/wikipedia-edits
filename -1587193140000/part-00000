This gas is called a ''[[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]'' (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>\u221222</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed. In this way, it is possible to study conditions akin to those in the early Universe at the age of 10\u201340 microseconds.\n\n[[QCD matter#Laboratory experiments|Discovery]] of this new QGP [[state of matter]] has been announced both at [[CERN]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Alison|year=2000|title=CERN claims first experimental creation of quark\u2013gluon plasma|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/35001196|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=403|issue=6770|pages=581|doi=10.1038/35001196|pmid=10688162|bibcode=2000Natur.403..581A|issn=0028-0836|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> and at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacak|first=Barbara|last2=Steinberg|first2=Peter|year=2010|title=Creating the perfect liquid in heavy-ion collisions|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=39\u201343|doi=10.1063/1.3431330|bibcode=2010PhT....63e..39J|issn=0031-9228}}</ref> At this time comprehensive experimental evidence about its properties is being assembled.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached. An even stronger signature of strangeness enhancement is the highly enhanced production of [[#Strangeness (and charm) hadronization|strange antibaryons]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|year=2015|orig-year=1980|title=Extreme states of nuclear matter - 1980: From: \"Workshop on Future Relativistic Heavy Ion Experiments\" held 7-10 October 1980 at: GSI, Darmstadt, Germany|journal=The European Physical Journal A|language=en|volume=51|issue=9|pages=115|doi=10.1140/epja/i2015-15115-y|bibcode=2015EPJA...51..115R|issn=1434-6001|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|year=2015|orig-year=1983|title=Strangeness and phase changes in hot hadronic matter - 1983: From: \"Sixth High Energy Heavy Ion Study\" held 28 June - 1 July 1983 at: LBNL, Berkeley, CA, USA|journal=The European Physical Journal A|language=en|volume=51|issue=9|pages=116|doi=10.1140/epja/i2015-15116-x|bibcode=2015EPJA...51..116R|issn=1434-6001|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Equilibrium of strangeness in quark-gluon plasma ==\n\nOne cannot assume that under all conditions the yield of strange quarks is in thermal equilibrium.

Suppression is expected when a otherwise absent quantum number, such as strangeness, is produced rarely. This situation was recognized by [[Rolf Hagedorn|Hagedorn]] in his early analysis of particle production and solved by [[Johann Rafelski|Rafelski]] and Danos.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|last2=Danos|first2=Michael|year=1980|title=The importance of the reaction volume in hadronic collisions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0370269380906012|journal=Physics Letters B|language=en|volume=97|issue=2|pages=279\u2013282|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(80)90601-2|via=}}</ref> In that work it was shown that even if just a few new pairs of strange particles were produced the effect disappears.

[[ALICE experiment|ALICE]] obtained this ratio for several collision systems in a wide range of [[hadronization]] volumes as described by total produced particle multiplicy.

Instead this confirms the  theoretical kinetic model proposed by Rafelski and [[Berndt M\u00fcller|Mueller]].<ref name=\":4\" /> The production of QGP in pp collisions was not expected by all but should not be a surprise: the [[onset of deconfinement]] is naturally a function of both energy and collision system size.

Onset of deconfinement in pp and other \"small\" system collisions is today an active research topic.\n\nBeyond strangeness the great advantage offered by LHC energy range is the abundant production of charm and bottom flavor. When QGP is formed these quarks are embedded in a high density of strangeness present. This should lead to copious production of exotic heavy particles, for example {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.

In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>\u221222</sup> s.

This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached.

This situation was recognized by [[Rolf Hagedorn|Hagedorn]] in his early analysis of particle production and solved by [[Johann Rafelski|Rafelski]] and Danos.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|last2=Danos|first2=Michael|year=1980|title=The importance of the reaction volume in hadronic collisions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0370269380906012|journal=Physics Letters B|language=en|volume=97|issue=2|pages=279\u2013282|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(80)90601-2|via=}}</ref> In that work it was shown that even if just a few new pairs of strange particles were produced the effect disappears. However, the matter was revived by Hamieh et al.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Hamieh|first=Salah|last2=Redlich|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Tounsi|first3=Ahmed|year=2000|title=Canonical description of strangeness enhancement from p\u2013A to Pb\u2013Pb collisions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0370269300007620|journal=Physics Letters B|language=en|volume=486|issue=1-2|pages=61\u201366|doi=10.1016/S0370-2693(00)00762-0|via=}}</ref> who argued that is possible that small sub-volumes in QGP are of relevance. This argument can be resolved by exploring specific sensitive experimental signatures for example the ratio of double strange particles of different type, such yield of <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) compared to <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>). [[ALICE experiment|ALICE]] obtained this ratio for several collision systems in a wide range of [[hadronization]] volumes as described by total produced particle multiplicy. The results seen in the figure show that this ratio assumes the expected value for a large range volumes (two orders of magnitude). At small particle volume or multiplicity the curve shows the expected reduction: The <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) must be smaller compared to  <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>) there since the number of produced strange pairs decreases and thus it easier to make <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>) compared to <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) which requires two pairs minimum to be made.  However, we also see an increase at very high volume - this is an effect at the level of one-two standard deviations. Similar results were already recognized before by Petran et al..<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petr\u00e1\u0148|first=Michal|last2=Rafelski|first2=Johann|year=2010|title=Multistrange particle production and the statistical hadronization model|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.82.011901|journal=Physical Review C|language=en|volume=82|issue=1|pages=011901|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.82.011901|issn=0556-2813|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnother highly praised [[ALICE experiment|ALICE]] result<ref name=\":0\" /> is the observation of same strangeness enhancement not only on AA  (nucleus-nucleus) but also in pA (proton-nucleus) and pp (proton-proton) collisions when the particle production yields are presented as a function of the multiplicity, which as noted corresponds to the available [[hadronization]] volume. ALICE results display a smooth volume dependence of total yield of all studied particles as function of volume, there is no additional \"canonical\" suppression.<ref name=\":5\" /> This is so since the yield of strange pairs in QGP  is sufficiently high and tracks well the expected abundance increase as the volume and lifespan of QGP increases. This increase is incompatible with the hypothesis that for all reaction volumes QGP is always in chemical (yield) equilibrium of strangeness. Instead this confirms the  theoretical kinetic model proposed by Rafelski and [[Berndt M\u00fcller|Mueller]].<ref name=\":4\" /> The production of QGP in pp collisions was not expected by all but should not be a surprise: the [[onset of deconfinement]] is naturally a function of both energy and collision system size. The fact that at extreme LHC energies we cross this boundary also in experiments with the smallest elementary collision systems, such as pp, confirms the unexpected strength of the processes leading to QGP formation. Onset of deconfinement in pp and other \"small\" system collisions is today an active research topic.\n\nBeyond strangeness the great advantage offered by LHC energy range is the abundant production of charm and bottom flavor. When QGP is formed these quarks are embedded in a high density of strangeness present. This should lead to copious production of exotic heavy particles, for example {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.  Other heavy flavor particles, some which have not even been discovered at this time are also likely to appear.<ref>\n{{cite journal|author=I. Kuznetsova|author2=J.

These results are presented as function of the variable called [[rapidity]] which characterizes the speed of the source. The peak of emission indicates that the additionally formed antimatter particles do not originate from the colliding nuclei themselves, but from a source that moves at a speed corresponding to one-half of the rapidity of the incident nucleus that is a common center of momentum frame of reference source formed when both nuclei collide, that is the hot quark\u2013gluon plasma fireball.\n==Horn in <math>K \\rightarrow \\pi </math> ratio and the onset of deconfinement==\n{{See also|Onset of deconfinement}}[[File:NA61-NA49_horn.png|thumb|280px|The ratio of mean multiplicities of positively charged [[kaon]]s and [[pion]]s as a function of collision energy in collisions of two [[lead]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and [[proton]]\u2013proton interactions.]]One of most interesting questions is if there is a threshold in reaction energy and/or volume size which needs to be exceeded in order to form a domain in which quarks can move freely.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gazdzicki|first=Marek|last2=Gorenstein|first2=Mark|last3=Seyboth|first3=Peter|year=2020|title=Brief history of the search for critical structures in heavy-ion collisions|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02255|journal=arXiv:2004.02255 [hep-ph, physics:nucl-ex, physics:nucl-th]|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> It is natural to expect that if such a threshold exists the particle yields/ratios we have shown above should indicate that.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Becattini|first=F.|year=2012|title=Strangeness and onset of deconfinement|journal=Physics of Atomic Nuclei|language=en|volume=75|issue=5|pages=646\u2013649|doi=10.1134/S106377881205002X|bibcode=2012PAN....75..646B|issn=1063-7788}}</ref> One of the most accessible signatures would be the relative [[Kaon]] yield ratio.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=N.K.

In both cases one describes the data within the statistical thermal production model, but considerable differences in detail differentiate the nature of the source of these particles. The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. There are as many as 10\u201315 different particles species which follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content. At yet higher LHC energies saturation of strangeness yield and binding to heavy flavor open new experimental opportunities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]]\n* [[Quark matter]]\n* [[Hadronization]]\n* [[Strangelet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{physics-footer}}\n{{Phase of matter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strangeness Production}}\n[[Category:Strangeness production| ]]\n[[Category:Strange quark|Production]]\n[[Category:Exotic matter]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Particle physics]]\n[[Category:Phases of matter]]\n[[Category:Plasma physics]]\n[[Category:Quantum chromodynamics]]\n", "name_user": "Bibliophilen", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo fixed.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangeness_production"}
