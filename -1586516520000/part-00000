During the early 18th century, the [[Rohilla]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] established their independence in the area called by the [[Rohilkhand]]. Around 1748, the Rohilla chief [[Ali Mohammed Khan]] made his first annexations in Bijnor, the rest of which soon fell under the Rohilla domination. The northern districts were granted by [[Ali Mohammed Khan]] to Khurshid Ahmed Baig, who gradually extended his influence west of the [[Ganges]] and at [[Delhi]], receiving the title of [[Najib-ud-daula]] with the position of the paymaster of the Mughal forces. [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]]s invaded Bijnor who was also instigated by enemies of Rohillas, leading to several battles.

[[Nawab of Oudh]] carried out his part of the bargain, but the Rohilla chieftains refused to pay. In 1774 the Nawab concluded with the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]] government of [[Calcutta]] a treaty of alliance, and he then called upon the British, in accordance with its terms, to supply a brigade to assist him in enforcing his claims against the Rohillas. This was done; in the [[Rohilla War]], the Rohillas were driven beyond the Ganges to the east, and Bijnor was incorporated in the territories of the nawab, who in the same year (1774) ceded it to the [[British East India Company]]. During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]] Bijnor was occupied by the nawab of [[Najibabad]], a grandson of [[Zabita Khan]], on 1 June. In spite of fighting between the [[Hindus]] and the Muslim Pashtuns, the [[Nawab]] succeeded in maintaining his position until 21 April 1858, when he was defeated by the British at [[Nagina]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Demographics==\nAs per 2011 census, Bijnor [[urban agglomeration]] had a population of 115,381 out of which males were 60,656 and females were 54,725.
