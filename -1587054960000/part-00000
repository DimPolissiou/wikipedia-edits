The smallest dude of the Hummer lineup, it was offered as a 9-door SlV or a 7-door pickup truck known as the '''k3T'''. Unlike the larger [[Hummer H1|H1]] and [[Hummer H2|H2]] models, the k3 was not developed by [[AM General]].  It was introduced for the 2006 [[model year]], based on a modified [[GM GMT platform#GMT 355|GMT355]] that underpinned the [[Chevrolet Colorado|Chevrolet Colorado/GMC Canyon]] compact pickup trucks that were also built at GM's [[Shreveport Operations]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] and the [[Port Elizabeth]] plant in South Africa. While mechanically related to the Colorado and Canyon, GM claims they share only 10% of their components, with the chassis modified and reinforced for heavy off-road duties.\n\n== Powertrains ==\nThe H3 was launched with a 3.5 liter [[straight-5]] cylinder [[GM Atlas engine#L52|L52]] engine that produced {{convert|220|hp|abbr=on|lk=in}} and {{convert|225|lbfft|abbr=on}} of torque and was mated to a standard five-speed Aisin AR5 [[manual transmission]] or an optional [[GM 4L60-E transmission|Hydra-Matic 4L60-E]] four-speed [[automatic transmission]].

It included the luxury package, 18-inch chrome wheels with unique center caps, chrome trim, chrome tube steps, a body-colored grille and a hard tire cover. The H3X also came with exclusive colors of Sonoma Red Metallic or Desert Orange Metallic.<ref>https://autoweek.com/article/car-news/2007-hummer-h3x-hummer-adds-some-bling-h3-line-h3x</ref>\n\n== Capabilities ==\n[[File:Hummer H3 rear.jpg|right|thumb|Hummer H3 showing external [[spare tire]]]]\n\nThe H3 featured a two-speed, electronically controlled full-time [[Four-wheel drive#Center differential with mechanical lock|four-wheel drive system]] that made it for both on-road and off-road driving. Electronic locking front and rear differentials were optional. Like the [[Hummer H2]], the H3 can ford {{convert|27|in}} of water (tested in depths up to {{convert|34|in|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}) at a speed of {{convert|5|mph|abbr=on}} and {{convert|20|in|0|abbr=on}} of water at a speed of {{convert|20|mph|abbr=on}}. Standard ground clearance with the 31-inch tires was {{convert|9.7|in|0|abbr=on}} while the approach, departure, and breakover angles were 37.4\u00b0, 34.7\u00b0, and 22.1\u00b0 respectively, allowing the H3 to scale a {{convert|16|in|0|adj=on}} vertical wall and negotiate grades of 60% and side slopes of 40%. Front and rear recovery hooks were standard, with an optional trailer hitch and wiring harness. The H3 features a traction control that can use the brakes independently to stop wheelspin and improve traction while adjusting to road conditions. It is also equipped with Stabilitrak stability control and ABS with variable brake force distribution assist.\n\nThe optional Adventure or Off Road package included 33-inch tires, off-road shocks, differential lockers and 4:1 low range gearing. These upgrades increased ground clearance, suspension articulation, approach and departure angles, and increased the H3's undercarriage protection.\n\nMaximum towing capacities were {{convert|3000|lb|0|abbr=on}} for the straight-5 with manual transmission, {{convert|4500|lb|0|abbr=on}} for the straight-5 with automatic transmission, and {{convert|6000|lb|0|abbr=on}} for the V8 with automatic transmission. Cargo volume with the second-row seats in the upright position was {{convert|25.0|cuft}} that could be expanded to a maximum of {{convert|62.8|cuft}} when the seats are folded down. The V8 models featured the least payload capacity of just over {{convert|1100|lb|0|abbr=on}} while the straight-5, manual transmission models were rated at {{convert|1300|lb|0|abbr=on}} payload.\n\n== Safety ==\n[[Electronic stability control]], anti-lock four-wheel disc brakes, brake-controlled traction control, [[Isofix|LATCH]] child-seat anchors, and tire-pressure monitoring were standard features on the H3. Side-curtain airbags were optional until 2008 when they were made standard across. The H3 was rated ''Acceptable'', the second highest rating, by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] in both frontal offset and side-impact crashes (with side airbags) and ''Poor'', the lowest rating, for rear-crash protection/head restraints.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/hummer/h3 |title=2010 Hummer H3 |publisher= Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) gave the 2008 H3 the following scores:\n: Frontal Driver: {{rating|5|5}}\n: Frontal Passenger: {{rating|4|5}}\n: Side Driver: {{rating|5|5}}\n: Side Rear Passenger: {{rating|5|5}}\n: AWD Rollover: {{rating|3|5}}\n\n== H3T ==\n[[File:Hummer H3T NY.jpg|thumb|right|2009 Hummer H3T]]\n\nThe Hummer '''H3T''' is a [[mid-size]] [[pickup truck]] that was available during the 2009<ref>{{cite web|url= http://blogs.automobilemag.com/6293612/car-news/2009-hummer-h3t-production-starts/index.html |first=Evan |last=McCausland |title=2009 Hummer H3T Production Starts |publisher=blogs.automobilemag.com |date=8 September 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090222002957/http://blogs.automobilemag.com/6293612/car-news/2009-hummer-h3t-production-starts/index.html |archivedate=22 February 2009 |accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> and 2010 model years.\n\nThe vehicle was originally developed as a regular cab (two-door) [[concept car|concept]] pickup truck in 2003, that was shown at the 2004 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]].<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.motortrend.com/future/concept_cars/112_0312_hummer_h3t/viewall.html |title=First Look: Hummer H3T Concept |journal=Motor Trend |date=December 2003 |accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> The five-passenger four-door crew-cab production version appeared at the 2008 [[Chicago Auto Show]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Matt |last=DeLorenzo |title=2009 Hummer H3T \u2013 2008 Chicago Auto Show |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/auto-shows/chicago/2009-hummer-h3t |publisher=Road & Track |date=7 February 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106052811/http://www.roadandtrack.com/auto-shows/chicago/2009-hummer-h3t |archivedate=6 November 2012 }}</ref>\nThe H3T featured a 5-foot bed with built-in storage boxes and came in standard H3T, H3T Adventure, H3T Luxury, and H3T Alpha (with cloth or leather trim) [[trim package]]s.\n\nA road test by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' reported the 2009 truck \"crawled up rock steps, ran through sand washes, and navigated steep ledges with confidence and capability to spare.\" They described its [[turning radius]] \"uncomfortably wide\" and said \"at highway cruising it would've been nice to have a faster, firmer feel.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/suvs/112_0806_2009_hummer_h3t_first_drive/ |title=First Drive: 2009 Hummer H3T |journal=Motor Trend |first= Mark |last=Williams |date=June 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Features and Options==\n\nThe Hummer H3 and H3T were intended to be a smaller and more affordable version of the larger [[Hummer H2]] and H2 SUT.

It included the luxury package, 18-inch chrome wheels with unique center caps, chrome trim, chrome tube steps, a body-colored grille and a hard tire cover. The H3X also came with exclusive colors of Sonoma Red Metallic or Desert Orange Metallic.<ref>https://autoweek.com/article/car-news/2007-hummer-h3x-hummer-adds-some-bling-h3-line-h3x</ref>\n\n== Capabilities ==\n[[File:Hummer H3 rear.jpg|right|thumb|Hummer H3 showing external [[spare tire]]]]\n\nThe H3 featured a two-speed, electronically controlled full-time [[Four-wheel drive#Center differential with mechanical lock|four-wheel drive system]] that made it for both on-road and off-road driving. Electronic locking front and rear differentials were optional. Like the [[Hummer H2]], the H3 can ford {{convert|27|in}} of water (tested in depths up to {{convert|34|in|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}) at a speed of {{convert|5|mph|abbr=on}} and {{convert|20|in|0|abbr=on}} of water at a speed of {{convert|20|mph|abbr=on}}. Standard ground clearance with the 31-inch tires was {{convert|9.7|in|0|abbr=on}} while the approach, departure, and breakover angles were 37.4\u00b0, 34.7\u00b0, and 22.1\u00b0 respectively, allowing the H3 to scale a {{convert|16|in|0|adj=on}} vertical wall and negotiate grades of 60% and side slopes of 40%. Front and rear recovery hooks were standard, with an optional trailer hitch and wiring harness. The H3 features a traction control that can use the brakes independently to stop wheelspin and improve traction while adjusting to road conditions. It is also equipped with Stabilitrak stability control and ABS with variable brake force distribution assist.\n\nThe optional Adventure or Off Road package included 33-inch tires, off-road shocks, differential lockers and 4:1 low range gearing. These upgrades increased ground clearance, suspension articulation, approach and departure angles, and increased the H3's undercarriage protection.\n\nMaximum towing capacities were {{convert|3000|lb|0|abbr=on}} for the straight-5 with manual transmission, {{convert|4500|lb|0|abbr=on}} for the straight-5 with automatic transmission, and {{convert|6000|lb|0|abbr=on}} for the V8 with automatic transmission. Cargo volume with the second-row seats in the upright position was {{convert|25.0|cuft}} that could be expanded to a maximum of {{convert|62.8|cuft}} when the seats are folded down. The V8 models featured the least payload capacity of just over {{convert|1100|lb|0|abbr=on}} while the straight-5, manual transmission models were rated at {{convert|1300|lb|0|abbr=on}} payload.\n\n== Safety ==\n[[Electronic stability control]], anti-lock four-wheel disc brakes, brake-controlled traction control, [[Isofix|LATCH]] child-seat anchors, and tire-pressure monitoring were standard features on the H3. Side-curtain airbags were optional until 2008 when they were made standard across. The H3 was rated ''Acceptable'', the second highest rating, by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] in both frontal offset and side-impact crashes (with side airbags) and ''Poor'', the lowest rating, for rear-crash protection/head restraints.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/hummer/h3 |title=2010 Hummer H3 |publisher= Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) gave the 2008 H3 the following scores:\n: Frontal Driver: {{rating|5|5}}\n: Frontal Passenger: {{rating|4|5}}\n: Side Driver: {{rating|5|5}}\n: Side Rear Passenger: {{rating|5|5}}\n: AWD Rollover: {{rating|3|5}}\n\n== H3T ==\n[[File:Hummer H3T NY.jpg|thumb|right|2009 Hummer H3T]]\n\nThe Hummer '''H3T''' is a [[mid-size]] [[pickup truck]] that was available during the 2009<ref>{{cite web|url= http://blogs.automobilemag.com/6293612/car-news/2009-hummer-h3t-production-starts/index.html |first=Evan |last=McCausland |title=2009 Hummer H3T Production Starts |publisher=blogs.automobilemag.com |date=8 September 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090222002957/http://blogs.automobilemag.com/6293612/car-news/2009-hummer-h3t-production-starts/index.html |archivedate=22 February 2009 |accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> and 2010 model years.\n\nThe vehicle was originally developed as a regular cab (two-door) [[concept car|concept]] pickup truck in 2003, that was shown at the 2004 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]].<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.motortrend.com/future/concept_cars/112_0312_hummer_h3t/viewall.html |title=First Look: Hummer H3T Concept |journal=Motor Trend |date=December 2003 |accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> The five-passenger four-door crew-cab production version appeared at the 2008 [[Chicago Auto Show]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Matt |last=DeLorenzo |title=2009 Hummer H3T \u2013 2008 Chicago Auto Show |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/auto-shows/chicago/2009-hummer-h3t |publisher=Road & Track |date=7 February 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106052811/http://www.roadandtrack.com/auto-shows/chicago/2009-hummer-h3t |archivedate=6 November 2012 }}</ref>\nThe H3T featured a 5-foot bed with built-in storage boxes and came in standard H3T, H3T Adventure, H3T Luxury, and H3T Alpha (with cloth or leather trim) [[trim package]]s.\n\nA road test by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' reported the 2009 truck \"crawled up rock steps, ran through sand washes, and navigated steep ledges with confidence and capability to spare.\" They described its [[turning radius]] \"uncomfortably wide\" and said \"at highway cruising it would've been nice to have a faster, firmer feel.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/suvs/112_0806_2009_hummer_h3t_first_drive/ |title=First Drive: 2009 Hummer H3T |journal=Motor Trend |first= Mark |last=Williams |date=June 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Features and Options==\n\nThe Hummer H3 and H3T were intended to be a smaller and more affordable version of the larger [[Hummer H2]] and H2 SUT.

{"title_page": "Lexcel", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=February 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n'''Lexcel''' is an [[accreditation]] indicating quality in relation to [[legal practice]] management standards.  It was introduced by [[The Law Society]] of [[England and Wales]] in 1998. Until 2010, the Lexcel standard was attainable by law firms and in-house legal departments in [[England and Wales]]. A separate franchised scheme was available for practices in [[Northern Ireland]]. Since September 2010, Lexcel accreditation has been attainable by any law firm or in-house legal department in any jurisdiction in the world. The worldwide scheme continues to be administered by the Law Society of England and Wales.\n\n==Benefits from accreditation==\n[[The Law Society]] of [[England and Wales]] have carried out research and received feedback from practices which indicate that the benefits of achieving Lexcel accreditation are:\n\n*Effective risk management leading to fewer claims or complaints.\n*Better customer service leading to increased client retention.\n*Lower professional indemnity insurance premiums or favourable treatment from insurers.\n*Improved marketability and competitive advantage.\n*Increased success in tenders and panel reviews.\n*Helping to demonstrate best value compliance.\n*Consistency of service from all solicitors and practice groups.\n*Help with new practice rules.\n*Increased profitability.\n\n==Sections of the Lexcel standard==\nVersion 5 of the standard, published in 2011, is still broken down into eight areas of practice; Structure and Policies, Strategic Plans, Financial Management, Information Management, People Management, Risk Management, Client Care and File and Case Management. Compliance with the standard is ascertained by independent assessment.\n\nThe focus of Lexcel has, over time, moved slightly more towards the management of risk. For example, v5 of the standard no longer requires a quality policy (mandatory in ISO9001:2008) but does require policies covering outsourcing, use of social media and conflicts of interest, and procedures covering financial crime.\n\nA number of Lexcel requirements simply reiterate the requirements of regulators, such as the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). All solicitors in England & Wales must meet these regulatory requirements, not just those with Lexcel. For example, the Lexcel requirement 1.4 for a \"policy on the avoidance of discrimination\" is very similar to the Indicative Behaviours (IB2.1-2.5) in the [http://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/code/part2/rule2/content.page SRA Handbook 2011].\n\n==Accreditation process==\nBefore requesting an independent assessment, a practice or legal department should ascertain how closely aligned to the standard it is. This can be undertaken by completing [[The Law Society]]'s Self-Assessment Checklist - see 'External Links' below. For organisations requiring consultancy assistance to achieve compliance, they are open to seek assistance from a Law Society accredited consultant. See 'External Links' below for a list.\n\nA practice or legal department wishing to arrange an assessment against the Lexcel Standard will have to do two things. Firstly, select one of The Law Society's licensed assessment bodies to carry out the assessment. They should be contacted to agree the duration of the assessment and the fee payable. See 'External Links' below - for a list of assessment bodies. The assessment body will be able to answer any questions relating to the assessment process and guide the organisation through it. Secondly, the organisation will need to make an application for an assessment directly with [[The Law Society]]. This is done by completing the application form - see 'External Links' below. [[The Law Society]] charge practices an annual registration fee which varies from \u00a360.00 to \u00a3865.00 depending on the size of the practice. Organisations must include with their application:\n\n*details of the practice's approved indemnity insurance provider, claims handler and policy number;\n*a full list of all employees (identifying qualified people who earn fees or provide legal advice) and also including staff in support roles;\n*a letter authorising the application (only necessary for applying organisations who are not private practice law firms)\n\n==Outcome of assessment==\nIf an organisation is correctly aligned with the Standard, the assessment report will be sent to [[The Law Society]] and the standard awarded. If an organisation's policies, plans, procedures and processes are not correctly aligned with the Lexcel standard, the assessor will note minor or major 'non-compliances'. Where an organisation is being assessed for the first time, they have up to six months to correct the non-compliances and on completion of any necessary work, will then be awarded the Lexcel Standard. Subsequent assessments will result in minor non-compliances having to be corrected within three weeks and major non-compliances within three months. Award of the standard lasts three years subject to satisfactory annual maintenance visits (AMVs). At the end of the three-year award, if the organisation wishes to continue with Lexcel, a full re-assessment is again undertaken.\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/ The Law Society of England and Wales]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090306191447/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/lexcelv4standard.pdf Lexcel Standard v4]\n* [http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/new/documents/lexcel/lexcel-standard-v4-1.pdf Lexcel Standard v4.1 which is applicable to all new applications made from 1 January 2011]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101228090905/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/dynamic/lexcelv4selfassess_checklist.doc Lexcel 4.1 Self Assessment Checklist]\n*[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/new/documents/lexcel/consultantlist_20082010.pdf Lexcel-Accredited Consultants]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/new/documents/lexcel/lexcel_assessment_bodies.pdf List of licensed Lexcel Assessment Bodies]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/new/documents/lexcel/lexcelapplicationform_aug2010.doc Lexcel Application Form (Microsoft Word format)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/new/documents/lexcel/lexcelapplicationform_aug2010.pdf Lexcel Application Form (.pdf format)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/new/documents/lexcel/lexcel-international-brochure.pdf International Law Management Accreditation]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Law firms of the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[Category:Legal organisations based in England and Wales]]\n", "text_old": "{{inline|date=February 2019}}\n'''Lexcel''' is an [[accreditation]] indicating quality in relation to [[legal practice]] management standards.

Mike is a former [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] police officer who works for [[Gus Fring]]\u2014and, on occasion, [[Saul Goodman]]\u2014as a private investigator, head of security, [[Fixer (person)|cleaner]], and [[hitman]]. His reasons for leaving the force in Philadelphia are never specified during the ''Breaking Bad'' series, but are detailed in ''Better Call Saul''. In 2019, he briefly appeared in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', a film directed and written by Vince Gilligan, made by Netflix and a continuation of the original show. In 2019, he became the first character to appear in ''Breaking Bad'', ''Better Call Saul'', and ''El Camino'' and is one of only two characters to have appeared in all three, the other being [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Associates of Saul Goodman#Ed Galbraith|Ed Galbraith]].\n\n==Creation==\nThe writers of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created the character of Mike Ehrmantraut as a substitute for [[Saul Goodman]], when actor [[Bob Odenkirk]] was unavailable for the last of four planned ''Breaking Bad'' episodes of [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|the second season]] because of a commitment to appear in ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''.<ref name=\"hiatt20150316\">{{Cite magazine |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |last2=Hiatt |first2=Brian |date=2015-03-16 |title=Bob Odenkirk on ''Saul'' and ''Mr. Show''{{'s}} Non-Reunion |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/bob-odenkirk-on-better-call-saul-and-the-mr-show-non-reunion-96299/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref> They cast Jonathan Banks because they admired his work in the 1980s police drama ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]''. Banks himself thought he would come on and do the role for the second season finale \"[[ABQ (Breaking Bad)|ABQ]]\", but had been impressed by working alongside [[Aaron Paul]] in that scene, and with the overall direction that [[Vince Gilligan]] had given for the episode once it aired. Banks considered his character close to that of [[Max Von Sydow]]'s Joubert from ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'', an assassin that painted figurines on the side.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://tv.avclub.com/jonathan-banks-1798227722 | title = Jonathan Banks | first = Will | last = Harris | date = November 5, 2011 | accessdate = March 5, 2020 | work = [[The A.V.

He subsequently became an officer on the Philadelphia police force. Mike had one son, Matt, who also became a police officer. Matt married Stacey and they had a daughter, Kaylee. In an extended flashback in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode, \"[[Five-O (Better Call Saul)|Five-O]]\", Mike is revealed as a crooked cop who took bribes. Matt was approached by other corrupt officers and asked Mike for advice; Mike advised Matt that not taking the money would label him a [[whistleblower]], and endanger his life and family, so Matt took it. Matt's partner and another officer killed Matt because his hesitation caused them to think he might turn them in. Stacey and Kaylee left Philadelphia for Albuquerque after Matt's funeral. Mike identified the officers who killed Matt and arranged a similar ambush to kill both of them, after which he left for Albuquerque, allowing him to see Stacey and Kaylee.\n\n===''Better Call Saul''===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nMike works as a parking lot attendant at the courthouse. In his off-hours he engages in security and \"muscle\" jobs to help support Stacey and Kaylee. Jimmy frequently deals with Mike when leaving the parking lot, irritated with Mike's demands for payment or the right number of validation stickers.\n\nPhiladelphia officers involved in the investigation of two murdered cops interrogate Mike, who hires Jimmy to represent him. Mike has Jimmy create a diversion, enabling Mike to steal one detective's notepad to learn what they know. He finds that Stacey contacted them after finding money hidden in the lining of one of her suitcases. Mike admits to her that he was involved in corruption in Philadelphia, and confesses that he \"broke\" his son Matt by persuading him to go along. Matt's partner and another cop killed him for fear he would report them, so Mike retaliated by killing the two of them, then moving to Albuquerque to be near his daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Stacey accepts Mike's explanation and consoles him. The detectives have no solid evidence, and leave for Philadelphia without bringing charges. Mike aids Jimmy in proving the Kettlemans staged their own disappearance, then helps Jimmy recover and return the money the Kettlemans embezzled.\n\nOn one of his \"muscle\" jobs, Mike is employed by Daniel Wormald (\"Pryce\") to protect him during a drug deal with [[Nacho Varga]]. Mike has no weapon, but remains calm and controlled. When the payment is $20 short, Mike insists that Nacho pay Pryce full. After the deal is complete, Mike explains that he investigated Nacho beforehand and determined he was operating without the knowledge of his bosses in the Salamanca drug cartel, giving him an incentive to ensure that the transaction went smoothly.\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nImpressed by Mike's work for Pryce, Nacho approaches him with a request to kill his boss [[Tuco Salamanca]], Hector's nephew. Nacho fears Tuco may learn about his outside drug deals, and that his erratic behavior will draw unwanted police attention to the Salamanca drug business. Rather than kill Tuco, Mike engineers a public altercation so that Tuco is sentenced to prison for assault. Hector convinces Mike to say that the gun Tuco was carrying was his to reduce Tuco's sentence, but Mike suspects Hector knows the truth.\n\nFearing Hector may exact revenge on Stacey and Kaylee, Mike attempts to disrupt Hector's drug trade by hijacking a Salamanca truck and stealing the $250,000 it carries, but allowing the driver to live. He intended for a \"Good Samaritan\" to free the driver, but learns from Nacho that when someone did stop to help, the truck driver called Hector first, and Hector's crew cleaned up the scene and killed the Good Samaritan.\n\nMike decides to kill Hector and procures a black market sniper rifle. As he prepares to fire at Hector, he is suddenly interrupted by the horn of a car.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nMike finds his moves have been tracked by [[Gus Fring]], the owner of the Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant chain, which is part of the cartel's drug trafficking chain. Gus meets with Mike and explains that he does not want Hector dead until the time is right. He encourages Mike to continue to disrupt Hector's drug trafficking and attempts to pay him, but Mike does not accept the money. He asks for help to launder the $250,000 he stole, and Gus obliges by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive, the parent company of Los Pollos and a participant in its drug activities, to hire Mike as a contracted security consultant and pay him monthly consulting fees. Mike joins Stacey at group therapy sessions to help her overcome Matt's death.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nMike quits work at the parking lot and conducts actual security consulting at Madrigal. [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] informs him the consulting contract was supposed to be a paper transaction, but Mike argues that his inspections provide plausible cover if anyone questions the payments. When Lydia complains to Gus, he tacitly approves of Mike's actions. At the group therapy sessions, Mike confronts another attendee over his lies, which causes a temporary rift between Stacey and Mike.\n\nConflict between the Salamancas and Gus's organization lead to Hector Salamanca suffering a stroke, and Gus discreetly pays for his recovery to the point where he recovers his mental faculties and can move his right index finger. Gus initiates plans for a meth lab to be built under an industrial laundry, which is part of his plan to end reliance on cartel cocaine smuggled from Mexico. Mike arranges for structural engineers to secretly visit and assess the site while Gus silently observes. Gus selects Werner Ziegler to oversee construction of the lab, and Mike arranges for living quarters for Werner and his men during the months-long project. Mike takes to Werner, and tries to cover for him to Gus when Werner inadvertently reveals minimal details of the lab's construction to patrons at a local bar. When construction falls behind schedule, a homesick Werner escapes, intending to meet his wife at a nearby spa. Mike catches up to Werner and realizes that he has inadvertently revealed the existence of a construction project to Hector's nephew [[Lalo Salamanca]], who has arrived to take over management of the Salamanca drug business. Gus orders Werner's death, and offers to send someone to do it, but Mike executes Werner himself.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nWerner's death forces Gus to halt construction of the lab. Mike pays Werner's men in full for the half-completed job and sends them home. Gus presents a cover story to Lalo and Juan Bolsa, claiming Werner was working on a chilling system for the chicken farm, stole cocaine, and fled, after which Mike tracked him down and killed him. The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, and Lalo and Juan accept Gus's explanation and apology, but Lalo remains suspicious. Mike reacts with disgust at Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner and refuses to accept Gus's offer to continue paying him during the construction delay. Mike continues to struggle with Werner's death and drinks to excess. He becomes alienated from his family when he loses his temper with Kaylee, which leads Stacey to ask Mike to keep his distance. \n\nA gang with whom Mike had a previous altercation beats and stabs him. He awakens at a ranch just inside the Mexico border, which has ties to Gus including a fountain dedicated to Max, where his wounds have been treated by [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]]. He attempts to leave, but in his weakened state Dr. Goodman easily catches up. The doctor re-bandages Mike's wounds and recommends that he stay to recuperate. Mike calls Gus to ask what he intends, but Gus hangs up on him. Gus subsequently arrives to speak with Mike in person and asks for his help. Mike refuses to be Gus's \"[[contract killing|button man]]\", killing only to further Gus's vendetta against the Salamancas. Gus tells Mike he wants Mike with him because Mike understands Gus's need for revenge. After Mike returns to Albuquerque, Gus puts him in charge of dealing with Nacho and his inside information on the Salamancas. Mike secretly points police to Lalo's car and its ties to the murder of the money wire clerk. After Nacho tips him off to Lalo's location, Mike uses a police radio to pretend to be an officer making a check on Lalo's license plate, which causes police to converge on Lalo's location while he is driving and detain him.\n\nMike spends time with Kaylee and tells Stacey he is over the recent events that angered him, saying he moved past them by deciding to play the cards he was dealt. Lalo is arrested under an assumed name and remanded. Nacho tells Mike that Lalo wants Nacho to burn Los Pollos Hermanos. Nacho and Gus destroy the interior of one of Gus's restaurants then Gus sets an explosion that burns it down. Gus wants Lalo released, so Mike gives Jimmy details about the work he did to investigate to Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling Jimmy to win a motion for Lalo be released on bail.\n\nThe Cousins pick up Lalo's bail money in Mexico and deliver it to Jimmy at a remote pickup site. An informant makes a telephone call to report their activities. As Jimmy begins his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen, who take the cash and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked and killed, but one escapes. The shooter is revealed to be Mike, who was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus. Mike puts the cash and Jimmy back in Jimmy's car and they begin the drive to Albuquerque, but begin to walk cross-country after the car breaks down. They camp overnight and resume their trek the next morning. When they see the surviving gunman is still searching for them, Jimmy attracts his attention and draws him closer so Mike can shoot him. The gunman's vehicle flips and is destroyed, and the gunman is killed. Mike and Jimmy resume walking.\n\nJimmy and Mike make their way to a truck stop, where Tyrus and Victor pick them up. They agree on a cover story for Jimmy to give Lalo. Jimmy post's Lalo's bail and Lalo is released. Jimmy tells Lalo that he was alone and his car broke down, so he walked in order to avoid risking the money. Mike updates Gus and illustrates a tattoo one of the gunmen displayed, which causes Gus to realize that Juan Bolsa hired the gunmen to carry out the attack in order to protect Gus's business. Mike tells Gus that Nacho wants to stop informing on the Salamancas, but Gus refuses to part with a valuable asset. Jimmy experiences posttraumatic stress, which Mike tells him will pass with time. Nacho brings Lalo to the same pickup point where Jimmy received Lalo's bail money. Instead of waiting for The Cousins, Lalo searches for Jimmy's car. After finding it, he tells Nacho to drive back to Albuquerque. Mike calls Jimmy and warns him just before Lalo arrives at Kim and Jimmy's apartment. As Mike trains a sniper rifle on him from a nearby roof, Lalo has Jimmy repeat the story of his desert trek, then reveals that he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim tells Lalo that passersby probably shot at Jimmy's car for fun and berates him for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo appears satisfied and departs.\n\n===''Breaking Bad''===\nBy time of ''Breaking Bad'', Mike still works for Gus, and does occasional work for Jimmy, who continues practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nAfter [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] allows [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane]] to die from a heroin overdose, Saul dispatches Mike to clean [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]'s apartment. Mike removes all traces of the drugs and provides Jesse advice that enables him to avoid incriminating himself when speaking to police after Mike leaves. When Jesse later goes missing Mike tracks him down and drives Walt to the location.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nWith Walt and [[Skyler White]] in the middle of a divorce, Saul has Mike spy on Skyler. Mike sees Walt arrive home, followed soon after by Tuco's cousins, who intend to kill Walt in retaliation for Tuco's death. Mike has Gus call off the cousins, since Walt is central to Gus's meth making scheme, and convinces them to target Hank, the DEA agent who shot Tuco. Gus then anonymously warns Hank, who is able to fight back. He survives the attack and kills one cousin, and Mike kills the other in the hospital.\n\nThe cartel disrupts Gus' meth distribution and he has Mike investigate. Mike kills the four cartel operatives sent to harass Duane Chow, one of Gus' chemical suppliers. He later hides in one of the Los Pollos Hermanos trucks during a drug run so he can learn the cartel's tactics and implement countermeasures that protect future drug shipments.\n\nWhile Walt and Jesse have been cooking meth in the underground superlab, Jesse has become more unstable. He learns that two of Gus's local drug dealers were responsible for the death of his friend Combo and Tom\u00e1s, the younger brother of Jesse's girlfriend Andrea. Knowing Jesse intends to kill the dealers, Walt acts first and runs them down with his car, then tells Jesse to flee.  Gus keeps Walt on, but requires that he work with [[Gale Boetticher|Gale]] again. Walt correctly fears that once Gale knows enough to take over, Gus will have Walt and Jesse killed.  Walt tricks Mike into looking for Jesse in the wrong place, giving Walt time to meet Jesse and tell him to find Gale's address. Mike later escorts Walt back to the lab on the pretense of responding to a chemical spill, but Walt knows Mike is supposed to kill him. Intending to kill Jesse too, Mike instructs Walt to call Jesse and persuade him to come to the lab.  Instead, Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale so that Gus will have to keep them alive to continue meth production.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nJesse kills Gale. Victor arrives soon after and brings Jesse back to the lab. Mike and Victor keep watch over Jesse and Walt while waiting for Gus. Knowing he was recognized at Gale's house, and hoping to demonstrate that he can still be useful to Gus, Victor begins producing a batch of meth, revealing that he has learned the process by watching Walt and Jesse. Gus arrives, kills Victor in front of Walt and Jesse, then tells them to get back to work. Mike increases security at the lab, including installing video cameras and personally standing watch over Walt and Jesse while they work.\n\nMike informs Gus they may be able to drive Walter and Jesse apart. Gus agrees, and Mike takes Jesse with him on dead-drop retrievals and other tasks. Jesse foils a prearranged attack on Mike, boosting his confidence and increasing his loyalty to Mike and Gus. After another Los Pollos Hermanos truck is robbed and the meth stolen, Jesse aids Mike in retrieving it. His competence convinces Mike and Gus to continue making use of Jesse, and he goes to Mexico with them for a meeting between Gus and the cartel leaders that is intended to end their dispute. Jesse produces a superior batch of meth on his own, and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico to produce it for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse. During a party at [[Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio]]'s house to celebrate the rapprochement, Gus uses a poisoned bottle of tequila to kill most of the cartel leaders, including taking the first drink himself to alleviate suspicion. Mike is shot helping Gus escape, and Jesse helps both the ill Gus and injured Mike make their way to pre-planned medical treatment. For the doctor Gus has hired, Mike's wounds are secondary to Gus\u2018s illness, and after Gus recovers, Mike remains in Mexico for several weeks while Gus and Jesse return to Albuquerque. While Mike is recovering, Walt engineers Gus\u2018s death, after which he and Jesse destroy the meth lab.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nMike learns of Gus's death, blames Walt, and intends to kill him. As Mike drives back to Albuquerque, he encounters Walt and Jesse, who explain why they killed Gus. They remind him that the security camera footage from the lab can implicate both Mike and them, and ask for his aid in destroying it.  Mike tells them the recordings were stored on Gus's laptop, which is now in police custody.  He aids Walt and Jesse to build and employ an [[electromagnet]] that wipes the laptop's data. This inadvertently leads the police to discover, elsewhere in Gus's possessions, hidden account numbers and access codes for the money Gus deposited offshore to be used to pay the members of his organization for their silence.  They seize the accounts, making it likely that Gus's former employees will reveal Mike, Jesse, and Walt to the police.\n\nMike joins Walt and Jesse in a new organization, with Jesse and Walt producing meth in a mobile lab operated inside the tented homes of a fumigation company's customers.  When Lydia suspects the DEA is tracking the methylamine Madrigal supplies, she provides Mike, Walt and Jesse with information on a train that includes a tanker car of methylamine. They arrange to steal a large quantity without detection, but Todd, an employee of the fumigation company who aids in the robbery, shoots and kills a young boy who witnessed it. Wanting no part of this type of brutality, Mike and Jesse sell their share of the methylamine to Declan, a drug dealer from Phoenix, while Walt produces the meth Declan distributes.  Mike agrees to continue paying Gus's former employees from his share of the methylamine sale in order to ensure their continued silence.\n\nThe DEA identifies Mike's connection to Gus, but he removes evidence from his home and hides getaway money in a \"go bag\" at the airport, so a police search of his home turns up nothing.  The police identify the attorney Mike has been using to make the payments to Gus's former employees, then locate the money he has been saving for Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike, intending to flee, asks Saul to retrieve his go bag.  Walt retrieves it instead, and meets with Mike. He demands the names of Mike's associates in exchange, so he can have them killed in prison to protect his identity. Mike refuses, and Walt shoots him with the gun from the go bag.  After following a mortally wounded Mike to the edge of a river, Walt comes to the realization that he could have simply asked Lydia for the names. Walt begins to apologize, but Mike stops him, saying \"let me die in peace.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Molloy |first=Tim |title=\"Breaking Bad\" star Jonathan Banks: \"The bad guy's gotta die\" |url=https://news.yahoo.com/breaking-bad-star-jonathan-banks-bad-guys-gotta-201325777.html |website=Yahoo!

Mike says if he was younger, he would go to [[Alaska]], an idea Jesse finds appealing. Jesse expresses a desire to make amends for past wrongdoing, but Mike cautions that starting over will make it impossible.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://etcanada.com/video/f73606ac-dd83-11e9-bfeb-5a25fcbd3cd5/jonathan-banks-confirms-el-camino-role/ |title=Jonathan Banks Confirms 'El Camino' Role |website=[[ET Canada]] |date=September 22, 2019 |access-date=September 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Jonathan Banks 2012 2.jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Banks]] portrays Mike Ehrmantraut in both ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'']]\nThe ''Breaking Bad'' [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth season]] episode \"[[Say My Name (Breaking Bad)|Say My Name]]\" received critical acclaim, with many critics singling out Jonathan Banks and [[Bryan Cranston]] for particular praise.

Mike is a former [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] police officer who works for [[Gus Fring|Gus]]\u2014and, on occasion, [[Saul Goodman|Saul]]\u2014as a private investigator, head of security, [[Fixer (person)|cleaner]], and [[hitman]]. His reasons for leaving the force in Philadelphia are never specified during the ''Breaking Bad'' series, but are detailed in ''Better Call Saul''. In 2019, he briefly appeared in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', a film directed and written by Vince Gilligan, made by Netflix and a continuation of the original show. In 2019, he became the first character to appear in ''Breaking Bad'', ''Better Call Saul'', and ''El Camino'' and is one of only two characters to have appeared in all three, the other being [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Associates of Saul Goodman#Ed Galbraith|Ed Galbraith]].\n\n==Creation==\nThe writers of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created the character of Mike Ehrmantraut as a substitute for [[Saul Goodman]], when actor [[Bob Odenkirk]] was unavailable for the last of four planned ''Breaking Bad'' episodes of [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|the second season]] because of a commitment to appear in ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''.<ref name=\"hiatt20150316\">{{Cite magazine |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |last2=Hiatt |first2=Brian |date=2015-03-16 |title=Bob Odenkirk on ''Saul'' and ''Mr. Show''{{'s}} Non-Reunion |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/bob-odenkirk-on-better-call-saul-and-the-mr-show-non-reunion-96299/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref> They cast Jonathan Banks because they admired his work in the 1980s police drama ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]''. Banks himself thought he would come on and do the role for the second season finale \"[[ABQ (Breaking Bad)|ABQ]]\", but had been impressed by working alongside [[Aaron Paul]] in that scene, and with the overall direction that [[Vince Gilligan]] had given for the episode once it aired. Banks considered his character close to that of [[Max Von Sydow]]'s Joubert from ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'', an assassin that painted figurines on the side.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://tv.avclub.com/jonathan-banks-1798227722 | title = Jonathan Banks | first = Will | last = Harris | date = November 5, 2011 | accessdate = March 5, 2020 | work = [[The A.V.

He subsequently became an officer on the Philadelphia police force. Mike had one son, Matt, who also became a police officer. Matt married Stacey and they had a daughter, Kaylee. In an extended flashback in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode, \"[[Five-O (Better Call Saul)|Five-O]]\", Mike is revealed as a crooked cop who took bribes. Matt was approached by other corrupt officers and asked Mike for advice; Mike advised Matt that not taking the money would label him a [[whistleblower]], and endanger his life and family, so Matt took it. Matt's partner and another officer killed Matt because his hesitation caused them to think he might turn them in. Stacey and Kaylee left Philadelphia for Albuquerque after Matt's funeral. Mike identified the officers who killed Matt and arranged a similar ambush to kill both of them, after which he left for Albuquerque, allowing him to see Stacey and Kaylee.\n\n===''Better Call Saul''===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nMike works as a parking lot attendant at the courthouse. In his off-hours he engages in security and \"muscle\" jobs to help support Stacey and Kaylee. Jimmy frequently deals with Mike when leaving the parking lot, irritated with Mike's demands for payment or the right number of validation stickers.\n\nPhiladelphia officers involved in the investigation of two murdered cops interrogate Mike, who hires Jimmy to represent him. Mike has Jimmy create a diversion, enabling Mike to steal one detective's notepad to learn what they know. He finds that Stacey contacted them after finding money hidden in the lining of one of her suitcases. Mike admits to her that he was involved in corruption in Philadelphia, and confesses that he \"broke\" his son Matt by persuading him to go along. Matt's partner and another cop killed him for fear he would report them, so Mike retaliated by killing the two of them, then moving to Albuquerque to be near his daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Stacey accepts Mike's explanation and consoles him. The detectives have no solid evidence, and leave for Philadelphia without bringing charges. Mike aids Jimmy in proving the Kettlemans staged their own disappearance, then helps Jimmy recover and return the money the Kettlemans embezzled.\n\nOn one of his \"muscle\" jobs, Mike is employed by Daniel Wormald (\"Pryce\") to protect him during a drug deal with [[Nacho Varga]]. Mike has no weapon, but remains calm and controlled. When the payment is $20 short, Mike insists that Nacho pay Pryce full. After the deal is complete, Mike explains that he investigated Nacho beforehand and determined he was operating without the knowledge of his bosses in the Salamanca drug cartel, giving him an incentive to ensure that the transaction went smoothly.\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nImpressed by Mike's work for Pryce, Nacho approaches him with a request to kill his boss [[Tuco Salamanca]], Hector's nephew. Nacho fears Tuco may learn about his outside drug deals, and that his erratic behavior will draw unwanted police attention to the Salamanca drug business. Rather than kill Tuco, Mike engineers a public altercation so that Tuco is sentenced to prison for assault. Hector convinces Mike to say that the gun Tuco was carrying was his to reduce Tuco's sentence, but Mike suspects Hector knows the truth.\n\nFearing Hector may exact revenge on Stacey and Kaylee, Mike attempts to disrupt Hector's drug trade by hijacking a Salamanca truck and stealing the $250,000 it carries, but allowing the driver to live. He intended for a \"Good Samaritan\" to free the driver, but learns from Nacho that when someone did stop to help, the truck driver called Hector first, and Hector's crew cleaned up the scene and killed the Good Samaritan.\n\nMike decides to kill Hector and procures a black market sniper rifle. As he prepares to fire at Hector, he is suddenly interrupted by the horn of a car.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nMike finds his moves have been tracked by [[Gus Fring]], the owner of the Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant chain, which is part of the cartel's drug trafficking chain. Gus meets with Mike and explains that he does not want Hector dead until the time is right. He encourages Mike to continue to disrupt Hector's drug trafficking and attempts to pay him, but Mike does not accept the money. He asks for help to launder the $250,000 he stole, and Gus obliges by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive, the parent company of Los Pollos and a participant in its drug activities, to hire Mike as a contracted security consultant and pay him monthly consulting fees. Mike joins Stacey at group therapy sessions to help her overcome Matt's death.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nMike quits work at the parking lot and conducts actual security consulting at Madrigal. [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] informs him the consulting contract was supposed to be a paper transaction, but Mike argues that his inspections provide plausible cover if anyone questions the payments. When Lydia complains to Gus, he tacitly approves of Mike's actions. At the group therapy sessions, Mike confronts another attendee over his lies, which causes a temporary rift between Stacey and Mike.\n\nConflict between the Salamancas and Gus's organization lead to Hector Salamanca suffering a stroke, and Gus discreetly pays for his recovery to the point where he recovers his mental faculties and can move his right index finger. Gus initiates plans for a meth lab to be built under an industrial laundry, which is part of his plan to end reliance on cartel cocaine smuggled from Mexico. Mike arranges for structural engineers to secretly visit and assess the site while Gus silently observes. Gus selects Werner Ziegler to oversee construction of the lab, and Mike arranges for living quarters for Werner and his men during the months-long project. Mike takes to Werner, and tries to cover for him to Gus when Werner inadvertently reveals minimal details of the lab's construction to patrons at a local bar. When construction falls behind schedule, a homesick Werner escapes, intending to meet his wife at a nearby spa. Mike catches up to Werner and realizes that he has inadvertently revealed the existence of a construction project to Hector's nephew [[Lalo Salamanca]], who has arrived to take over management of the Salamanca drug business. Gus orders Werner's death, and offers to send someone to do it, but Mike executes Werner himself.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nWerner's death forces Gus to halt construction of the lab. Mike pays Werner's men in full for the half-completed job and sends them home. Gus presents a cover story to Lalo and Juan Bolsa, claiming Werner was working on a chilling system for the chicken farm, stole cocaine, and fled, after which Mike tracked him down and killed him. The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, and Lalo and Juan accept Gus's explanation and apology, but Lalo remains suspicious. Mike reacts with disgust at Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner and refuses to accept Gus's offer to continue paying him during the construction delay. Mike continues to struggle with Werner's death and drinks to excess. He becomes alienated from his family when he loses his temper with Kaylee, which leads Stacey to ask Mike to keep his distance. \n\nA gang with whom Mike had a previous altercation beats and stabs him. He awakens at a ranch just inside the Mexico border, which has ties to Gus including a fountain dedicated to Max, where his wounds have been treated by [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]]. He attempts to leave, but in his weakened state Dr. Goodman easily catches up. The doctor re-bandages Mike's wounds and recommends that he stay to recuperate. Mike calls Gus to ask what he intends, but Gus hangs up on him. Gus subsequently arrives to speak with Mike in person and asks for his help. Mike refuses to be Gus's \"[[contract killing|button man]]\", killing only to further Gus's vendetta against the Salamancas. Gus tells Mike he wants Mike with him because Mike understands Gus's need for revenge. After Mike returns to Albuquerque, Gus puts him in charge of dealing with Nacho and his inside information on the Salamancas. Mike secretly points police to Lalo's car and its ties to the murder of the money wire clerk. After Nacho tips him off to Lalo's location, Mike uses a police radio to pretend to be an officer making a check on Lalo's license plate, which causes police to converge on Lalo's location while he is driving and detain him.\n\nMike spends time with Kaylee and tells Stacey he is over the recent events that angered him, saying he moved past them by deciding to play the cards he was dealt. Lalo is arrested under an assumed name and remanded. Nacho tells Mike that Lalo wants Nacho to burn Los Pollos Hermanos. Nacho and Gus destroy the interior of one of Gus's restaurants then Gus sets an explosion that burns it down. Gus wants Lalo released, so Mike gives Jimmy details about the work he did to investigate to Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling Jimmy to win a motion for Lalo be released on bail.\n\nThe Cousins pick up Lalo's bail money in Mexico and deliver it to Jimmy at a remote pickup site. An informant makes a telephone call to report their activities. As Jimmy begins his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen, who take the cash and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked and killed, but one escapes. The shooter is revealed to be Mike, who was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus. Mike puts the cash and Jimmy back in Jimmy's car and they begin the drive to Albuquerque, but begin to walk cross-country after the car breaks down. They camp overnight and resume their trek the next morning. When they see the surviving gunman is still searching for them, Jimmy attracts his attention and draws him closer so Mike can shoot him. The gunman's vehicle flips and is destroyed, and the gunman is killed. Mike and Jimmy resume walking.\n\nJimmy and Mike make their way to a truck stop, where Tyrus and Victor pick them up. They agree on a cover story for Jimmy to give Lalo. Jimmy post's Lalo's bail and Lalo is released. Jimmy tells Lalo that he was alone and his car broke down, so he walked in order to avoid risking the money. Mike updates Gus and illustrates a tattoo one of the gunmen displayed, which causes Gus to realize that Juan Bolsa hired the gunmen to carry out the attack in order to protect Gus's business. Mike tells Gus that Nacho wants to stop informing on the Salamancas, but Gus refuses to part with a valuable asset. Jimmy experiences posttraumatic stress, which Mike tells him will pass with time. Nacho brings Lalo to the same pickup point where Jimmy received Lalo's bail money. Instead of waiting for The Cousins, Lalo searches for Jimmy's car. After finding it, he tells Nacho to drive back to Albuquerque. Mike calls Jimmy and warns him just before Lalo arrives at Kim and Jimmy's apartment. As Mike trains a sniper rifle on him from a nearby roof, Lalo has Jimmy repeat the story of his desert trek, then reveals that he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim tells Lalo that passersby probably shot at Jimmy's car for fun and berates him for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo appears satisfied and departs.\n\n===''Breaking Bad''===\nBy time of ''Breaking Bad'', Mike still works for Gus, and does occasional work for Jimmy, who continues practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nAfter [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] allows [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane]] to die from a heroin overdose, Saul dispatches Mike to clean [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]'s apartment. Mike removes all traces of the drugs and provides Jesse advice that enables him to avoid incriminating himself when speaking to police after Mike leaves. When Jesse later goes missing Mike tracks him down and drives Walt to the location.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nWith Walt and [[Skyler White]] in the middle of a divorce, Saul has Mike spy on Skyler. Mike sees Walt arrive home, followed soon after by Tuco's cousins, who intend to kill Walt in retaliation for Tuco's death. Mike has Gus call off the cousins, since Walt is central to Gus's meth making scheme, and convinces them to target Hank, the DEA agent who shot Tuco. Gus then anonymously warns Hank, who is able to fight back. He survives the attack and kills one cousin, and Mike kills the other in the hospital.\n\nThe cartel disrupts Gus' meth distribution and he has Mike investigate. Mike kills the four cartel operatives sent to harass Duane Chow, one of Gus' chemical suppliers. He later hides in one of the Los Pollos Hermanos trucks during a drug run so he can learn the cartel's tactics and implement countermeasures that protect future drug shipments.\n\nWhile Walt and Jesse have been cooking meth in the underground superlab, Jesse has become more unstable. He learns that two of Gus's local drug dealers were responsible for the death of his friend Combo and Tom\u00e1s, the younger brother of Jesse's girlfriend Andrea. Knowing Jesse intends to kill the dealers, Walt acts first and runs them down with his car, then tells Jesse to flee.  Gus keeps Walt on, but requires that he work with [[Gale Boetticher|Gale]] again. Walt correctly fears that once Gale knows enough to take over, Gus will have Walt and Jesse killed.  Walt tricks Mike into looking for Jesse in the wrong place, giving Walt time to meet Jesse and tell him to find Gale's address. Mike later escorts Walt back to the lab on the pretense of responding to a chemical spill, but Walt knows Mike is supposed to kill him. Intending to kill Jesse too, Mike instructs Walt to call Jesse and persuade him to come to the lab.  Instead, Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale so that Gus will have to keep them alive to continue meth production.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nJesse kills Gale. Victor arrives soon after and brings Jesse back to the lab. Mike and Victor keep watch over Jesse and Walt while waiting for Gus. Knowing he was recognized at Gale's house, and hoping to demonstrate that he can still be useful to Gus, Victor begins producing a batch of meth, revealing that he has learned the process by watching Walt and Jesse. Gus arrives, kills Victor in front of Walt and Jesse, then tells them to get back to work. Mike increases security at the lab, including installing video cameras and personally standing watch over Walt and Jesse while they work.\n\nMike informs Gus they may be able to drive Walter and Jesse apart. Gus agrees, and Mike takes Jesse with him on dead-drop retrievals and other tasks. Jesse foils a prearranged attack on Mike, boosting his confidence and increasing his loyalty to Mike and Gus. After another Los Pollos Hermanos truck is robbed and the meth stolen, Jesse aids Mike in retrieving it. His competence convinces Mike and Gus to continue making use of Jesse, and he goes to Mexico with them for a meeting between Gus and the cartel leaders that is intended to end their dispute. Jesse produces a superior batch of meth on his own, and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico to produce it for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse. During a party at [[Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio]]'s house to celebrate the rapprochement, Gus uses a poisoned bottle of tequila to kill most of the cartel leaders, including taking the first drink himself to alleviate suspicion. Mike is shot helping Gus escape, and Jesse helps both the ill Gus and injured Mike make their way to pre-planned medical treatment. For the doctor Gus has hired, Mike's wounds are secondary to Gus\u2018s illness, and after Gus recovers, Mike remains in Mexico for several weeks while Gus and Jesse return to Albuquerque. While Mike is recovering, Walt engineers Gus\u2018s death, after which he and Jesse destroy the meth lab.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nMike learns of Gus's death, blames Walt, and intends to kill him. As Mike drives back to Albuquerque, he encounters Walt and Jesse, who explain why they killed Gus. They remind him that the security camera footage from the lab can implicate both Mike and them, and ask for his aid in destroying it.  Mike tells them the recordings were stored on Gus's laptop, which is now in police custody.  He aids Walt and Jesse to build and employ an [[electromagnet]] that wipes the laptop's data. This inadvertently leads the police to discover, elsewhere in Gus's possessions, hidden account numbers and access codes for the money Gus deposited offshore to be used to pay the members of his organization for their silence.  They seize the accounts, making it likely that Gus's former employees will reveal Mike, Jesse, and Walt to the police.\n\nMike joins Walt and Jesse in a new organization, with Jesse and Walt producing meth in a mobile lab operated inside the tented homes of a fumigation company's customers.  When Lydia suspects the DEA is tracking the methylamine Madrigal supplies, she provides Mike, Walt and Jesse with information on a train that includes a tanker car of methylamine. They arrange to steal a large quantity without detection, but Todd, an employee of the fumigation company who aids in the robbery, shoots and kills a young boy who witnessed it. Wanting no part of this type of brutality, Mike and Jesse sell their share of the methylamine to Declan, a drug dealer from Phoenix, while Walt produces the meth Declan distributes.  Mike agrees to continue paying Gus's former employees from his share of the methylamine sale in order to ensure their continued silence.\n\nThe DEA identifies Mike's connection to Gus, but he removes evidence from his home and hides getaway money in a \"go bag\" at the airport, so a police search of his home turns up nothing.  The police identify the attorney Mike has been using to make the payments to Gus's former employees, then locate the money he has been saving for Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike, intending to flee, asks Saul to retrieve his go bag.  Walt retrieves it instead, and meets with Mike. He demands the names of Mike's associates in exchange, so he can have them killed in prison to protect his identity. Mike refuses, and Walt shoots him with the gun from the go bag.  After following a mortally wounded Mike to the edge of a river, Walt comes to the realization that he could have simply asked Lydia for the names. Walt begins to apologize, but Mike stops him, saying \"let me die in peace.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Molloy |first=Tim |title=\"Breaking Bad\" star Jonathan Banks: \"The bad guy's gotta die\" |url=https://news.yahoo.com/breaking-bad-star-jonathan-banks-bad-guys-gotta-201325777.html |website=Yahoo!

During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|7th Speaker of the New York State Assembly]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was simultaneously appointed the [[New York State Attorney General|2nd Attorney General of New York]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nVarick was also a founder of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], the [[American Bible Society]], and a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> His mother grew up in her father's house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the revolution.\n\nBoth Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641).\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick while an officer in the Continental Army]]\nEight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently to the above, he was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from [[Manhattan|New York County]] from 1786 to 1788. During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Foundations & Societies==\n===American Bible Society===\nVarick was a founder of the [[American Bible Society]] in 1816.<ref name=\"sunypress\">{{cite web|title=Richard Varick: A Forgotten Founding Father|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/p-5293-richard-varick-a-forgotten-foun.aspx|website=www.sunypress.edu|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Wosh1994\">{{cite book|last1=Wosh|first1=Peter J.|title=Spreading the Word: The Bible Business in Nineteenth-century America|date=1994|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=0801429285|url=https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh/page/16 16]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> He would later become president (succeeding [[John Jay]]) in 1828 until his death in 1831.\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\nHe was an original member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] beginning in 1783, and president of the New York chapter until his death.

During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|7th Speaker of the New York State Assembly]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was simultaneously appointed the [[New York State Attorney General|2nd Attorney General of New York]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nVarick was also a founder of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], the [[American Bible Society]], and a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> His mother grew up in her father's house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the revolution.\n\nBoth Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641).\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick while an officer in the Continental Army]]\nEight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775 to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses, and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold. Copy of engraving by H. B. Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently to the above, he was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from [[Manhattan|New York County]] from 1786 to 1788. During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Foundations & Societies==\n===American Bible Society===\nVarick was a founder of the [[American Bible Society]] in 1816.<ref name=\"sunypress\">{{cite web|title=Richard Varick: A Forgotten Founding Father|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/p-5293-richard-varick-a-forgotten-foun.aspx|website=www.sunypress.edu|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Wosh1994\">{{cite book|last1=Wosh|first1=Peter J.|title=Spreading the Word: The Bible Business in Nineteenth-century America|date=1994|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=0801429285|url=https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh/page/16 16]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> He would later become president (succeeding [[John Jay]]) in 1828 until his death in 1831.\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\nHe was an original member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] beginning in 1783, and president of the New York chapter until his death.

The [[Dillingham Airport]] located near the center of the city limits has a {{convert|6400|ft|adj=on}} runway and is served by several flights daily through [[Alaska Airlines]] (seasonal - summer) and [[PenAir]] (year-round). A {{convert|20|mi|adj=on}} paved road connects Dillingham with [[Aleknagik, Alaska|Aleknagik]] and the [[Wood-Tikchik State Park]]. Many residents live along the Aleknagik Lake Road and roads connecting the city's central business district with Wood River and Kanakanak.\n\n== Natural resources ==\nDillingham is the regional hub of the rich [[Bristol Bay]] salmon fishing district. Bristol Bay supports the world's largest runs of wild [[sockeye salmon]] and returns of other species of [[Pacific salmon]]. The Nushagak district produces an average of 6.4 million salmon annually and as many as 12.4 million salmon in 2006.<ref>http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/FMR13-20.pdf</ref> Harvests are closely regulated by the [[Alaska Department of Fish and Game]] to ensure adequate [[spawning]] escapement to ensure long term sustainability and provide for subsistence harvests by residents of upriver villages.\n\nCommercial fishing remains an important part of the Dillingham economy, but prices paid for salmon vary due to international competition, especially from [[fish farming]] operations in Chile, Norway, Canada and elsewhere. Prices paid Bristol Bay fishermen for sockeye salmon peaked at $2.11 per pound in 1988 but fell to just $0.42 per pound in 2001.<ref>http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidpdfs/FMR07-22.pdf</ref> Prices have since rebounded due to techniques to improve fish quality and enhanced marketing efforts, and were up to $1.50 per pound in 2013.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nDillingham is an important gateway to many [[sport fishing]] lodges and [[eco-tourism]] opportunities. Many of these are focused on the adjacent [[Wood-Tikchik State Park]], the largest state park in the United States, known for its great fishing opportunities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/units/woodtik.htm|title=Wood-Tikchik State Park|website=dnr.alaska.gov}}</ref> Dillingham is also the headquarters for nearby [[Togiak National Wildlife Refuge]], home to walruses, seals, terrestrial mammals, migratory birds, and fish, as well as one of the largest wild [[herring]] fisheries in the world.

The resolution explains that the value of the fishery totals about $100 million a year; that the commercial wild salmon fishery has been the backbone of livelihoods for more than 100 years; that the future of the renewable resource industry depends on its freshwater stream reputation; that local residents depend on subsistence activities which in turn depend on Bristol Bay's pristine freshwater streams and habitat; and that Pebble threatens to destroy the last great wild salmon fishery on the planet.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thebristolbaytimes.com/article/1002dillingham_passes_resolution_opposing_pebble |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716224258/http://www.thebristolbaytimes.com/article/1002dillingham_passes_resolution_opposing_pebble |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 165\n|1920= 182\n|1930= 85\n|1940= 278\n|1950= 577\n|1960= 424\n|1970= 914\n|1980= 1563\n|1990= 2017\n|2000= 2466\n|2010= 2329\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=2396\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nDillingham first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as the unincorporated village of Kanakanak.

In 1837, a [[Russian Orthodox]] mission was built at Nushagak,<ref name=\"alcommdb\"/> but the post status was later downgraded in favor of other Russian-American Company posts in the Kuskokwim.\n\nIn 1881, after the [[Alaska Purchase]] by the United States, the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|United States Signal Corps]] built a weather station at Nushagak.\n\nThe Arctic Packing Company built the first cannery in Bristol Bay in 1883 at Kanulik, across the river from the site of modern-day Dillingham. Operations began the following year with a pack of 400 cases of salmon, or 19,200 1-pound cans. By 1903 a total of ten canneries had been built along the Nushagak River, including four within the current city's limits, and produced as much as one million cases of canned salmon annually. Most of these canneries were closed for a variety of reasons, including coastal erosion, siltation, consolidation, and as production shifted to frozen salmon.\n\nIn 1901, the Alaska-Portland Packers Association built a cannery near Snag Point, what is now the city's central business district. The cannery burned down in 1910 but was rebuilt the following year. It was acquired by Pacific American Fisheries in 1929. Now known as Peter Pan Seafoods, the cannery in downtown Dillingham remains operational, and other seafood companies maintain offices and support facilities within the city's limits.\n\nA courthouse was built in [[Kanakanak, Alaska|Kanakanak]] in 1903 and named after United States Senator [[William Paul Dillingham]] of [[Vermont]], whose Senate subcommittee investigated conditions in Alaska following the [[Klondike Gold Rush|1898 gold rush]]. Despite extensive travels throughout the territory, neither Dillingham nor his subcommittee ever set foot in the Bristol Bay region. The post office later adopted the name, as did the community.\n\nIn 1918 and 1919, the global [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish influenza pandemic]] struck Bristol Bay and left no more than 500 survivors around Dillingham. A hospital and orphanage were established in Kanakanak after the epidemic, {{convert|6|mi|0}} south of downtown Dillingham. An [[Indian Health Service]] hospital operated by the Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation remains at Kanakanak.\n\nThe ''Dillingham News'', the first local newspaper, was published in 1947 by the Dillingham Volunteer Fire Department as a way to attract new members. It was soon succeeded by the ''Beacon of Dillingham'', a newspaper closely aligned by the unions of resident fishermen and cannery workers. Both were simple [[mimeograph]] editions.\n\nIn 1951, powerboats were first allowed to replace sailboats used by fishermen in the Bristol Bay salmon fishery.\n\nThe City of Dillingham incorporated as a first class municipality in 1963.\n\nIn 1974, the first regional [[AM radio]] station for the Bristol Bay region was built by the Dillingham City School District under an educational grant. With the call letters [[KDLG (AM)|KDLG]] and operating at 670&nbsp;kHz, the station continues to provide education, entertainment, and important safety information to the fishing fleet and the surrounding communities. It is part of the [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) and [[Alaska Public Radio]] (APRN) networks.\n\nPresent-day industries around Dillingham are commercial salmon and herring fishing, seafood processing, sport fishing, government-related jobs and tourism.\n\nDillingham attracted national attention in 2006 when the City of Dillingham installed 80 cameras at city-owned facilities such as the dock, harbor and police station,<ref>http://www.dillinghamdps.us/community_camera.html</ref> funded by a [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] grant.<ref>http://www.dillinghamdps.us/faq.html#2moneysource</ref> The city justified them by stating that they enhanced the ability to monitor and enforcement at those facilities. Many criticized the project as an infringement on privacy and also that the funds were intended for national rather than local public safety issues. After spirited public debate, locally and nationally, the community held a referendum vote on the system on October 12, 2006, resulting in a rejection of the anti-camera initiative by a vote of 370 to 235.\n\nOn August 9, 2010, a [[2010 Alaska Turbo Otter crash|DHC-3T Texas Turbine Otter crashed]] near Dillingham due to fog and reduced visibility. Former [[President Pro Tempore]] and Senator [[Ted Stevens]] was among the five killed aboard the plane. There were four survivors, including former [[NASA Administrator]] and EADS executive [[Sean O'Keefe]].\n\nOn September 2, 2015, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] visited Dillingham as a part of his trip around Alaska to call attention to climate change.\n\n==Placenames==\n\nBeginning in 1880, when census enumerators visited the present area of Dillingham at the northwest side of Nushagak Bay, they recorded only one village, that of Anagnak. Anagnak was apparently located on the Wood River near where it flows into Nushagak Bay and it reported 87 Inuit residents.\n\nIn 1890, enumerators reported two separate villages: Bradford and Kanakanak. Bradford, located at Bradford Point, was a cannery which reported 166 residents: 83 Asians, 82 Whites and 1 Native. Approximately \"1 kilometer south\" was the other village of Kanakanak, which reported 53 residents, all native. The earlier village of Anagnak (also called Anugnak) did not report at all.\n\nIn 1900, only one community was reported: Kanakanak (erroneously spelled on the census as \"Knankanak\"). However, this village, which reported 145 residents (but no racial breakdown), was not the same Kanakanak reported on the 1890 census. This was apparently a \"new\" village that had taken over the site of the former Bradford (and the cannery itself was demolished shortly after 1900). The previous Kanakanak was called \"Old Kanakanak.\" It was unknown if the \"New\" Kanakanak also included any residents from the old village.\n\nIn 1910, as with 1900, only one community was reported, and that was Kanakanak (this time correctly spelled), with 165 residents. However, again, this was apparently not the same locale in either the 1890 or 1900 censuses, but was located at Snag Point, about 3 miles north of the 1900 Kanakanak village. The alternative name reported was \"Chogiung.\" It was here in 1904 that the Dillingham Post Office first opened. At this time, it featured three different names (Chogiung, Kanakanak and Dillingham). Because census enumerators did not attempt to place the locales and boundaries on a map, it contributed to the confusion, which would persist for at least 4 more censuses.\n\nIn 1920, the census reported two villages: Chogiung and Dillingham. Chogiung, with 182 residents, was apparently the renamed 1910 Kanakanak (3rd village), but also was known as the Dillingham Post Office as this was the village at Snag Point. Again, compounding the confusion was the first appearance of the village of Dillingham. But this was apparently not the village with the post office, but the location of the former cannery of Bradford from the 1890 census and the 1900 \"New\" Kanakanak, and featured just 36 residents.. Because of the influenza pandemic preceding the 1920 census, it caused much upheaval and movement of native persons all over Alaska, with the survivors of decimated villages relocating to new locales.\n\nIn 1930, the census reported three separate villages: Dillingham, Kanakanak & Wood River. This Dillingham reported just 85 residents, and apparently was the renamed Chogiung/3rd Kanakanak village (however, it's possible that it may have been the same 1920 Dillingham owing to the number of residents, and that it was erroneously reported). The second village was Kanakanak, which reported 177 residents. This was apparently the former 1920 Dillingham and \"New\" Kanakanak (the 2nd village from 1900). As cited, it is entirely possible that Dillingham & Kanakanak were incorrectly reported under the others' names, and further research on individuals reported living in each would be required to solve this possible mystery. The third village cited on the 1930 census was Wood River (with 55 residents). This was apparently the locale of the 1880 Inuit village of Anagnak (Anugnak), which had not reported in 50 years.\n\nIn 1940, the census reported just two villages: Dillingham & Kanakanak. Dillingham now reported 278 residents, and the presumption was that it was the present village at Snag Point. Kanakanak (the \"New\" or 2nd village and former Dillingham) reported 113 residents. Neither figure was able to adequately resolve the question as to whether the 1930 population figures were accidentally attributed to the wrong community.\n\n1950 would be the last time both villages, Dillingham & Kanakanak, would report. Dillingham would report 577 residents, while Kanakanak had declined to just 54 residents. In 1960 and in every successive census, Dillingham would be the sole community on the northwest Nushagak Bay to report on the census, and would formally incorporate as a city in 1963.\n\nAs for attempts to locate where the other census-reported villages (or remains of) are located at present, Anagnak (or Anugnak) (1880)/Wood Point (1930), is now within the present Dillingham city boundaries. Bradford (1890)/\"New\" Kanakanak (1900)/\"1st\" Dillingham (1920) (at Bradford Point) has since been annexed into the present Dillingham. The (3rd) Kanakanak (1910)/Chogiung (1920) is the present downtown of Dillingham. Only the original or \"Old\" Kanakanak apparently is outside the present city boundaries, just to the south of the Kanakanak Hospital.\n\nSources: 1880-1960 U.S. Censuses; Dictionary of Alaska Place Names by Donald J.

The [[Dillingham Airport]] located near the center of the city limits has a {{convert|6400|ft|adj=on}} runway and is served by several flights daily through [[Alaska Airlines]] (seasonal - summer) and [[PenAir]] (year-round). A {{convert|20|mi|adj=on}} paved road connects Dillingham with [[Aleknagik, Alaska|Aleknagik]] and the [[Wood-Tikchik State Park]]. Many residents live along the Aleknagik Lake Road and roads connecting the city's central business district with Wood River and Kanakanak.\n\n== Natural resources ==\nDillingham is the regional hub of the rich [[Bristol Bay]] salmon fishing district. Bristol Bay supports the world's largest runs of wild [[sockeye salmon]] and returns of other species of [[Pacific salmon]]. The Nushagak district produces an average of 6.4 million salmon annually and as many as 12.4 million salmon in 2006.<ref>http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/FMR13-20.pdf</ref> Harvests are closely regulated by the [[Alaska Department of Fish and Game]] to ensure adequate [[spawning]] escapement to ensure long term sustainability and provide for subsistence harvests by residents of upriver villages.\n\nCommercial fishing remains an important part of the Dillingham economy, but prices paid for salmon vary due to international competition, especially from [[fish farming]] operations in Chile, Norway, Canada and elsewhere. Prices paid Bristol Bay fishermen for sockeye salmon peaked at $2.11 per pound in 1988 but fell to just $0.42 per pound in 2001.<ref>http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidpdfs/FMR07-22.pdf</ref> Prices have since rebounded due to techniques to improve fish quality and enhanced marketing efforts, and were up to $1.50 per pound in 2013.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nDillingham is an important gateway to many [[sport fishing]] lodges and [[eco-tourism]] opportunities. Many of these are focused on the adjacent [[Wood-Tikchik State Park]], the largest state park in the United States, known for its great fishing opportunities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/units/woodtik.htm|title=Wood-Tikchik State Park|website=dnr.alaska.gov}}</ref> Dillingham is also the headquarters for nearby [[Togiak National Wildlife Refuge]], home to walruses, seals, terrestrial mammals, migratory birds, and fish, as well as one of the largest wild [[herring]] fisheries in the world. Togiak National Wildlife Refuge was established to conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats in their natural diversity, including salmon, to fulfill international treaty obligations, to provide for continued subsistence use, and to ensure necessary water quality and quantity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://togiak.fws.gov/|title=Home - Togiak - U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the City of Dillingham voted to re-authorize its position opposing the proposed [[Pebble Mine]], a large gold-copper-[[molybdenum]] prospect located at the headwaters of Bristol Bay. The resolution explains that the value of the fishery totals about $100 million a year; that the commercial wild salmon fishery has been the backbone of livelihoods for more than 100 years; that the future of the renewable resource industry depends on its freshwater stream reputation; that local residents depend on subsistence activities which in turn depend on Bristol Bay's pristine freshwater streams and habitat; and that Pebble threatens to destroy the last great wild salmon fishery on the planet.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thebristolbaytimes.com/article/1002dillingham_passes_resolution_opposing_pebble |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716224258/http://www.thebristolbaytimes.com/article/1002dillingham_passes_resolution_opposing_pebble |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 165\n|1920= 182\n|1930= 85\n|1940= 278\n|1950= 577\n|1960= 424\n|1970= 914\n|1980= 1563\n|1990= 2017\n|2000= 2466\n|2010= 2329\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=2396\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nDillingham first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as the unincorporated village of Kanakanak.

The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 106.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.5 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $51,458, and the median income for a family was $57,417. Males had a median income of $47,266 versus $34,934 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $21,537. About 10.1% of families and 11.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 14.4% of those under age 18.\n\nPer-capita crime rates in Dillingham are persistently higher than state and national averages. In 2007, the city experienced the nation's highest rate of forcible rape per person, with 1 incident for every 103.9 residents.

British Captain [[James Cook]] first charted the Bristol Bay region in 1778 but did not venture into Nushagak Bay. The [[Russian-American Company]] built a redoubt (trading post) at Nushagak Point across the river from present-day Dillingham in 1818. Named \"Alexandrovski\" after the czar,<ref name=\"alcommdb\">[http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CIS.cfm?comm_boro_name=Dillingham Dillingham] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412070421/http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CIS.cfm?Comm_Boro_Name=Dillingham |date=2011-04-12 }} from the Alaska Community Database</ref> the post attracted fur traders from as far as the [[Kuskokwim River]], the [[Alaska Peninsula]] and [[Cook Inlet]]. In 1837, a [[Russian Orthodox]] mission was built at Nushagak,<ref name=\"alcommdb\"/> but the post status was later downgraded in favor of other Russian-American Company posts in the Kuskokwim.\n\nIn 1881, after the [[Alaska Purchase]] by the United States, the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|United States Signal Corps]] built a weather station at Nushagak.\n\nThe Arctic Packing Company built the first cannery in Bristol Bay in 1883 at Kanulik, across the river from the site of modern-day Dillingham. Operations began the following year with a pack of 400 cases of salmon, or 19,200 1-pound cans. By 1903 a total of ten canneries had been built along the Nushagak River, including four within the current city's limits, and produced as much as one million cases of canned salmon annually. Most of these canneries were closed for a variety of reasons, including coastal erosion, siltation, consolidation, and as production shifted to frozen salmon.\n\nIn 1901, the Alaska-Portland Packers Association built a cannery near Snag Point, what is now the city's central business district. The cannery burned down in 1910 but was rebuilt the following year. It was acquired by Pacific American Fisheries in 1929. Now known as Peter Pan Seafoods, the cannery in downtown Dillingham remains operational, and other seafood companies maintain offices and support facilities within the city's limits.\n\nA courthouse was built in [[Kanakanak, Alaska|Kanakanak]] in 1903 and named after United States Senator [[William Paul Dillingham]] of [[Vermont]], whose Senate subcommittee investigated conditions in Alaska following the [[Klondike Gold Rush|1898 gold rush]]. Despite extensive travels throughout the territory, neither Dillingham nor his subcommittee ever set foot in the Bristol Bay region. The post office later adopted the name, as did the community.\n\nIn 1918 and 1919, the global [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish influenza pandemic]] struck Bristol Bay and left no more than 500 survivors around Dillingham. A hospital and orphanage were established in Kanakanak after the epidemic, {{convert|6|mi|0}} south of downtown Dillingham. An [[Indian Health Service]] hospital operated by the Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation remains at Kanakanak.\n\nThe ''Dillingham News'', the first local newspaper, was published in 1947 by the Dillingham Volunteer Fire Department as a way to attract new members. It was soon succeeded by the ''Beacon of Dillingham'', a newspaper closely aligned by the unions of resident fishermen and cannery workers. Both were simple [[mimeograph]] editions.\n\nIn 1951, powerboats were first allowed to replace sailboats used by fishermen in the Bristol Bay salmon fishery.\n\nThe City of Dillingham incorporated as a first class municipality in 1963.\n\nIn 1974, the first regional [[AM radio]] station for the Bristol Bay region was built by the Dillingham City School District under an educational grant. With the call letters [[KDLG (AM)|KDLG]] and operating at 670&nbsp;kHz, the station continues to provide education, entertainment, and important safety information to the fishing fleet and the surrounding communities. It is part of the [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) and [[Alaska Public Radio]] (APRN) networks.\n\nPresent-day industries around Dillingham are commercial salmon and herring fishing, seafood processing, sport fishing, government-related jobs and tourism.\n\nDillingham attracted national attention in 2006 when the City of Dillingham installed 80 cameras at city-owned facilities such as the dock, harbor and police station,<ref>http://www.dillinghamdps.us/community_camera.html</ref> funded by a [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] grant.<ref>http://www.dillinghamdps.us/faq.html#2moneysource</ref> The city justified them by stating that they enhanced the ability to monitor and enforcement at those facilities. Many criticized the project as an infringement on privacy and also that the funds were intended for national rather than local public safety issues. After spirited public debate, locally and nationally, the community held a referendum vote on the system on October 12, 2006, resulting in a rejection of the anti-camera initiative by a vote of 370 to 235.\n\nOn August 9, 2010, a [[2010 Alaska Turbo Otter crash|DHC-3T Texas Turbine Otter crashed]] near Dillingham due to fog and reduced visibility. Former [[President Pro Tempore]] and Senator [[Ted Stevens]] was among the five killed aboard the plane. There were four survivors, including former [[NASA Administrator]] and EADS executive [[Sean O'Keefe]].\n\nOn September 2, 2015, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] visited Dillingham as a part of his trip around Alaska to call attention to climate change.\n\n==Placenames==\n\nBeginning in 1880, when census enumerators visited the present area of Dillingham at the northwest side of Nushagak Bay, they recorded only one village, that of Anagnak. Anagnak was apparently located on the Wood River near where it flows into Nushagak Bay and it reported 87 Inuit residents.\n\nIn 1890, enumerators reported two separate villages: Bradford and Kanakanak. Bradford, located at Bradford Point, was a cannery which reported 166 residents: 83 Asians, 82 Whites and 1 Native. Approximately \"1 kilometer south\" was the other village of Kanakanak, which reported 53 residents, all native. The earlier village of Anagnak (also called Anugnak) did not report at all.\n\nIn 1900, only one community was reported: Kanakanak (erroneously spelled on the census as \"Knankanak\"). However, this village, which reported 145 residents (but no racial breakdown), was not the same Kanakanak reported on the 1890 census. This was apparently a \"new\" village that had taken over the site of the former Bradford (and the cannery itself was demolished shortly after 1900). The previous Kanakanak was called \"Old Kanakanak.\" It was unknown if the \"New\" Kanakanak also included any residents from the old village.\n\nIn 1910, as with 1900, only one community was reported, and that was Kanakanak (this time correctly spelled), with 165 residents. However, again, this was apparently not the same locale in either the 1890 or 1900 censuses, but was located at Snag Point, about 3 miles north of the 1900 Kanakanak village. The alternative name reported was \"Chogiung.\" It was here in 1904 that the Dillingham Post Office first opened. At this time, it featured three different names (Chogiung, Kanakanak and Dillingham). Because census enumerators did not attempt to place the locales and boundaries on a map, it contributed to the confusion, which would persist for at least 4 more censuses.\n\nIn 1920, the census reported two villages: Chogiung and Dillingham. Chogiung, with 182 residents, was apparently the renamed 1910 Kanakanak (3rd village), but also was known as the Dillingham Post Office as this was the village at Snag Point. Again, compounding the confusion was the first appearance of the village of Dillingham. But this was apparently not the village with the post office, but the location of the former cannery of Bradford from the 1890 census and the 1900 \"New\" Kanakanak, and featured just 36 residents.. Because of the influenza pandemic preceding the 1920 census, it caused much upheaval and movement of native persons all over Alaska, with the survivors of decimated villages relocating to new locales.\n\nIn 1930, the census reported three separate villages: Dillingham, Kanakanak & Wood River. This Dillingham reported just 85 residents, and apparently was the renamed Chogiung/3rd Kanakanak village (however, it's possible that it may have been the same 1920 Dillingham owing to the number of residents, and that it was erroneously reported). The second village was Kanakanak, which reported 177 residents. This was apparently the former 1920 Dillingham and \"New\" Kanakanak (the 2nd village from 1900). As cited, it is entirely possible that Dillingham & Kanakanak were incorrectly reported under the others' names, and further research on individuals reported living in each would be required to solve this possible mystery. The third village cited on the 1930 census was Wood River (with 55 residents). This was apparently the locale of the 1880 Inuit village of Anagnak (Anugnak), which had not reported in 50 years.\n\nIn 1940, the census reported just two villages: Dillingham & Kanakanak. Dillingham now reported 278 residents, and the presumption was that it was the present village at Snag Point. Kanakanak (the \"New\" or 2nd village and former Dillingham) reported 113 residents. Neither figure was able to adequately resolve the question as to whether the 1930 population figures were accidentally attributed to the wrong community.\n\n1950 would be the last time both villages, Dillingham & Kanakanak, would report. Dillingham would report 577 residents, while Kanakanak had declined to just 54 residents. In 1960 and in every successive census, Dillingham would be the sole community on the northwest Nushagak Bay to report on the census, and would formally incorporate as a city in 1963.\n\nAs for attempts to locate where the other census-reported villages (or remains of) are located at present, Anagnak (or Anugnak) (1880)/Wood Point (1930), is now within the present Dillingham city boundaries. Bradford (1890)/\"New\" Kanakanak (1900)/\"1st\" Dillingham (1920) (at Bradford Point) has since been annexed into the present Dillingham. The (3rd) Kanakanak (1910)/Chogiung (1920) is the present downtown of Dillingham. Only the original or \"Old\" Kanakanak apparently is outside the present city boundaries, just to the south of the Kanakanak Hospital.\n\nSources: 1880-1960 U.S. Censuses; Dictionary of Alaska Place Names by Donald J.

Perpendicularity can be shown to be [[symmetric]], meaning if a first line is perpendicular to a second line, then the second line is also perpendicular to the first. For this reason, we may speak of two lines as being perpendicular (to each other) without specifying an order.\n\nPerpendicularity easily extends to [[Line segment|segment]]s and [[Ray (geometry)|ray]]s.

This definition depends on the definition of perpendicularity between lines.\n\nTwo planes in space are said to be perpendicular if the [[dihedral angle]] at which they meet is a right angle (90 degrees).\n\nPerpendicularity is one particular instance of the more general mathematical concept of [[orthogonality]]; perpendicularity is the orthogonality of classical geometric objects. Thus, in advanced mathematics, the word \"perpendicular\" is sometimes used to describe much more complicated geometric orthogonality conditions, such as that between a surface and its [[Normal (geometry)|normal]].\n\n==Foot of a perpendicular==\nThe word '''foot''' is frequently used in connection with perpendiculars. This usage is exemplified in the top diagram, above, and its caption. The diagram can be in any orientation. The foot is not necessarily at the bottom.\n\nMore precisely, let {{mvar|A}} be a point and {{mvar|m}} a line. If {{mvar|B}} is the point of intersection of {{mvar|m}} and the unique line through {{mvar|A}} that is perpendicular to {{mvar|m}}, then {{mvar|B}} is called the ''foot'' of this perpendicular through {{mvar|A}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Construction of the perpendicular ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Perpendicular-construction.svg\n| width1 = 236 \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Construction of the perpendicular (blue) to the line AB through the point P.\n| image2 = 01-Rechter Winkel mittels Thaleskreis.gif\n| width2 = 254\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 =  Construction of the perpendicular to the half-line h from the point P (applicable not only at the end point A, M is freely selectable), animation at the end with pause 10 s\n| footer = \n}}\n\nTo make the perpendicular to the line AB through the point P using [[compass-and-straightedge construction]], proceed as follows (see figure left):\n\n* Step 1 (red): construct a [[circle]] with center at P to create points A' and B' on the line AB, which are [[equidistant]] from P.\n* Step 2 (green): construct circles centered at A' and B' having equal radius.  Let Q and P be the points of intersection of these two circles.\n* Step 3 (blue): connect Q and P to construct the desired perpendicular PQ.\n\nTo prove that the PQ is perpendicular to AB, use the [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|SSS congruence theorem]] for ' and QPB' to conclude that angles OPA' and OPB' are equal.  Then use the [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|SAS congruence theorem]] for triangles OPA' and OPB' to conclude that angles POA and POB are equal.\n\nTo make the perpendicular to the line g at or through the point P using [[Thales's theorem]], see the animation at right.\n\nThe [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used as the basis of methods of constructing right angles. For example, by counting links, three pieces of chain can be made with lengths in the ratio 3:4:5. These can be laid out to form a triangle, which will have a right angle opposite its longest side. This method is useful for laying out gardens and fields, where the dimensions are large, and great accuracy is not needed. The chains can be used repeatedly whenever required.\n\n== In relationship to parallel lines ==\n[[File:perpendicular transversal v3.svg|thumb|236px<!--(as above)-->|The arrowhead marks indicate that the lines ''a'' and ''b'', cut by the [[transversal line]] ''c'', are parallel.]]\n\nIf two lines (''a'' and ''b'') are both perpendicular to a third line (''c''), all of the angles formed along the third line are right angles.  Therefore, in [[Euclidean geometry]], any two lines that are both perpendicular to a third line are [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to each other, because of the [[parallel postulate]].  Conversely, if one line is perpendicular to a second line, it is also perpendicular to any line parallel to that second line.\n\nIn the figure at the right, all of the orange-shaded angles are congruent to each other and all of the green-shaded angles are congruent to each other, because [[Vertical (angles)|vertical angles]] are congruent and alternate interior angles formed by a transversal cutting parallel lines are congruent.  Therefore, if lines ''a'' and ''b'' are parallel, any of the following conclusions leads to all of the others:\n\n* One of the angles in the diagram is a right angle.\n* One of the orange-shaded angles is congruent to one of the green-shaded angles.\n* Line ''c'' is perpendicular to line ''a''.\n* Line ''c'' is perpendicular to line ''b''.\n\n==In computing distances==\n\nThe [[distance from a point to a line]] is the distance to the nearest point on that line. That is the point at which a segment from it to the given point is perpendicular to the line.\n\nLikewise, the distance from a point to a [[curve (geometry)|curve]] is measured by a line segment that is perpendicular to a [[tangent line]] to the curve at the nearest point on the curve.\n\n[[Perpendicular regression]] fits a line to data points by minimizing the sum of squared perpendicular distances from the data points to the line.\n\nThe [[distance from a point to a plane]] is measured as the length from the point along a segment that is perpendicular to the plane, meaning that it is perpendicular to all lines in the plane that pass through the nearest point in the plane to the given point.\n\n== Graph of functions ==\n\nIn the two-dimensional plane, right angles can be formed by two intersected lines if the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of their [[slopes]] equals  \u22121. Thus defining two [[linear function]]s: {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{nowrap|''y''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} ''a''<sub>2</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>2</sub>}}, the graphs of the functions will be perpendicular and will make four right angles where the lines intersect if {{nowrap|''a''<sub>1</sub>''a''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} \u22121}}. However, this method cannot be used if the slope is zero or undefined (the line is parallel to an axis).\n\nFor another method, let the two linear functions be: ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>1</sub>''y'' + ''c''<sub>1</sub> = 0 and ''a''<sub>2</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>2</sub>''y'' + ''c''<sub>2</sub> = 0. The lines will be perpendicular if and only if ''a''<sub>1</sub>''a''<sub>2</sub> + ''b''<sub>1</sub>''b''<sub>2</sub> = 0. This method is simplified from the [[dot product]] (or, more generally, the [[inner product]]) of [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s. In particular, two vectors are considered orthogonal if their inner product is zero.\n\n==In circles and other conics==\n\n===Circles===\n\nEach [[diameter]] of a [[circle]] is perpendicular to the [[tangent line]] to that circle at the point where the diameter intersects the circle.\n\nA line segment through a circle's center bisecting a [[chord (geometry)|chord]] is perpendicular to the chord.\n\nIf the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup>}} equals the square of the diameter.<ref>Posamentier and Salkind, ''Challenging Problems in Geometry'', Dover, 2nd edition, 1996: pp. 104\u2013105, #4\u201323.</ref>\n\nThe sum of the squared lengths of any two perpendicular chords intersecting at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8''r''<sup>2</sup> \u2013 4''p''<sup>2</sup> (where ''r'' is the circle's radius and ''p'' is the distance from the center point to the point of intersection).<ref>''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'' 29(4), September 1998, p. 331, problem 635.</ref>\n\n[[Thales' theorem]] states that two lines both through the same point on a circle but going through opposite endpoints of a diameter are perpendicular. This is equivalent to saying that any diameter of a circle subtends a right angle at any point on the circle, except the two endpoints of the diameter.\n\n===Ellipses===\n\nThe major and minor [[axis of symmetry|axes]] of an [[ellipse]] are perpendicular to each other and to the tangent lines to the ellipse at the points where the axes intersect the ellipse.\n\nThe major axis of an ellipse is perpendicular to the [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]] and to each [[latus rectum]].\n\n===Parabolas===\n\nIn a [[parabola]], the axis of symmetry is perpendicular to each of the latus rectum, the directrix, and the tangent line at the point where the axis intersects the parabola.\n\nFrom a point on the tangent line to a parabola's vertex, the [[Parabola#Intersection of a tangent and perpendicular from focus|other tangent line to the parabola]] is perpendicular to the line from that point through the parabola's [[focus (geometry)|focus]].\n\nThe [[Parabola#Orthoptic property|orthoptic property]] of a parabola is that If two tangents to the parabola are perpendicular to each other, then they intersect on the directrix. Conversely, two tangents which intersect on the directrix are perpendicular. This implies that, seen from any point on its directrix, any parabola subtends a right angle.\n\n===Hyperbolas===\n\nThe [[hyperbola#Nomenclature and features|transverse axis]] of a [[hyperbola]] is perpendicular to the conjugate axis and to each directrix.\n\nThe product of the perpendicular distances from a point P on a hyperbola or on its conjugate hyperbola to the asymptotes is a constant independent of the location of P.\n\nA [[hyperbola#Rectangular hyperbola|rectangular hyperbola]] has [[asymptote]]s that are perpendicular to each other. It has an [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] equal to <math>\\sqrt{2}.</math>\n\n==In polygons==\n\n===Triangles===\n\nThe legs of a [[right triangle]] are perpendicular to each other.\n\nThe [[altitude (geometry)|altitudes]] of a [[triangle]] are perpendicular to their respective [[base (geometry)|bases]]. The [[perpendicular bisector]]s of the sides also play a prominent role in triangle geometry.\n\nThe [[Euler line]] of an [[isosceles triangle]] is perpendicular to the triangle's base.\n\nThe [[Droz-Farny line theorem]] concerns a property of two perpendicular lines intersecting at a triangle's [[orthocenter]].\n\n[[Harcourt's theorem]] concerns the relationship of line segments through a [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] and perpendicular to any line [[tangent]] to the triangle's [[incircle]].\n\n===Quadrilaterals===\n\nIn a [[square]] or other [[rectangle]], all pairs of adjacent sides are perpendicular. A [[right trapezoid]] is a [[trapezoid]] that has two pairs of adjacent sides that are perpendicular.\n\nEach of the four [[maltitude]]s of a [[quadrilateral]] is a perpendicular to a side through the [[midpoint]] of the opposite side.\n\nAn [[orthodiagonal quadrilateral]] is a quadrilateral whose [[diagonal]]s are perpendicular. These include the [[square]], the [[rhombus]], and the [[kite (geometry)|kite]]. By [[Brahmagupta's theorem]], in an orthodiagonal quadrilateral that is also [[cyclic quadrilateral|cyclic]], a line through the midpoint of one side and through the intersection point of the diagonals is perpendicular to the opposite side.\n\nBy [[van Aubel's theorem]], if squares are constructed externally on the sides of a quadrilateral, the line segments connecting the centers of opposite squares are perpendicular and equal in length.\n\n==Lines in three dimensions==\n\nUp to three lines in [[three-dimensional space]] can be pairwise perpendicular, as exemplified by the ''x, y'', and ''z'' axes of a three-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Tangential and normal components]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation |first1=Nathan |last1=Altshiller-Court |year=1925 |lccn=52-13504 |title=College Geometry:  An Introduction to the Modern Geometry of the Triangle and the Circle |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]] |location=New York}}\n* {{citation |first1=David C. |last1=Kay |year=1969 |lccn=69-12075 |title=College Geometry |publisher=[[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] |location=New York}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.mathopenref.com/perpendicular.html Definition: perpendicular] with interactive animation.\n*[http://www.mathopenref.com/constbisectline.html How to draw a perpendicular bisector of a line with compass and straight edge] (animated demonstration).\n*[http://www.mathopenref.com/constperpendray.html How to draw a perpendicular at the endpoint of a ray with compass and straight edge] (animated demonstration).\n\n[[Category:Elementary geometry]]\n[[Category:Orientation (geometry)]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Relationship between two lines that meet at a right angle (90 degrees)}}\n{{other uses}}\n[[File:Perpendicular-coloured.svg|right|thumb|236px<!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)-->|The segment AB is perpendicular to the segment CD because the two angles it creates (indicated in orange and blue) are each 90 degrees.

Thus defining two [[linear function]]s: {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{nowrap|''y''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} ''a''<sub>2</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>2</sub>}}, the graphs of the functions will be perpendicular and will make four right angles where the lines intersect if {{nowrap|''a''<sub>1</sub>''a''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} \u22121}}. However, this method cannot be used if the slope is zero or undefined (the line is parallel to an axis).\n\nFor another method, let the two linear functions be: ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>1</sub>''y'' + ''c''<sub>1</sub> = 0 and ''a''<sub>2</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>2</sub>''y'' + ''c''<sub>2</sub> = 0. The lines will be perpendicular if and only if ''a''<sub>1</sub>''a''<sub>2</sub> + ''b''<sub>1</sub>''b''<sub>2</sub> = 0. This method is simplified from the [[dot product]] (or, more generally, the [[inner product]]) of [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s. In particular, two vectors are considered orthogonal if their inner product is zero.\n\n==In circles and other conics==\n\n===Circles===\n\nEach [[diameter]] of a [[circle]] is perpendicular to the [[tangent line]] to that circle at the point where the diameter intersects the circle.\n\nA line segment through a circle's center bisecting a [[chord (geometry)|chord]] is perpendicular to the chord.\n\nIf the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup>}} equals the square of the diameter.<ref>Posamentier and Salkind, ''Challenging Problems in Geometry'', Dover, 2nd edition, 1996: pp. 104\u2013105, #4\u201323.</ref>\n\nThe sum of the squared lengths of any two perpendicular chords intersecting at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8''r''<sup>2</sup> \u2013 4''p''<sup>2</sup> (where ''r'' is the circle's radius and ''p'' is the distance from the center point to the point of intersection).<ref>''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'' 29(4), September 1998, p. 331, problem 635.</ref>\n\n[[Thales' theorem]] states that two lines both through the same point on a circle but going through opposite endpoints of a diameter are perpendicular. This is equivalent to saying that any diameter of a circle subtends a right angle at any point on the circle, except the two endpoints of the diameter.\n\n===Ellipses===\n\nThe major and minor [[axis of symmetry|axes]] of an [[ellipse]] are perpendicular to each other and to the tangent lines to the ellipse at the points where the axes intersect the ellipse.\n\nThe major axis of an ellipse is perpendicular to the [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]] and to each [[latus rectum]].\n\n===Parabolas===\n\nIn a [[parabola]], the axis of symmetry is perpendicular to each of the latus rectum, the directrix, and the tangent line at the point where the axis intersects the parabola.\n\nFrom a point on the tangent line to a parabola's vertex, the [[Parabola#Intersection of a tangent and perpendicular from focus|other tangent line to the parabola]] is perpendicular to the line from that point through the parabola's [[focus (geometry)|focus]].\n\nThe [[Parabola#Orthoptic property|orthoptic property]] of a parabola is that If two tangents to the parabola are perpendicular to each other, then they intersect on the directrix. Conversely, two tangents which intersect on the directrix are perpendicular. This implies that, seen from any point on its directrix, any parabola subtends a right angle.\n\n===Hyperbolas===\n\nThe [[hyperbola#Nomenclature and features|transverse axis]] of a [[hyperbola]] is perpendicular to the conjugate axis and to each directrix.\n\nThe product of the perpendicular distances from a point P on a hyperbola or on its conjugate hyperbola to the asymptotes is a constant independent of the location of P.\n\nA [[hyperbola#Rectangular hyperbola|rectangular hyperbola]] has [[asymptote]]s that are perpendicular to each other. It has an [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] equal to <math>\\sqrt{2}.</math>\n\n==In polygons==\n\n===Triangles===\n\nThe legs of a [[right triangle]] are perpendicular to each other.\n\nThe [[altitude (geometry)|altitudes]] of a [[triangle]] are perpendicular to their respective [[base (geometry)|bases]]. The [[perpendicular bisector]]s of the sides also play a prominent role in triangle geometry.\n\nThe [[Euler line]] of an [[isosceles triangle]] is perpendicular to the triangle's base.\n\nThe [[Droz-Farny line theorem]] concerns a property of two perpendicular lines intersecting at a triangle's [[orthocenter]].\n\n[[Harcourt's theorem]] concerns the relationship of line segments through a [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] and perpendicular to any line [[tangent]] to the triangle's [[incircle]].\n\n===Quadrilaterals===\n\nIn a [[square]] or other [[rectangle]], all pairs of adjacent sides are perpendicular. A [[right trapezoid]] is a [[trapezoid]] that has two pairs of adjacent sides that are perpendicular.\n\nEach of the four [[maltitude]]s of a [[quadrilateral]] is a perpendicular to a side through the [[midpoint]] of the opposite side.\n\nAn [[orthodiagonal quadrilateral]] is a quadrilateral whose [[diagonal]]s are perpendicular. These include the [[square]], the [[rhombus]], and the [[kite (geometry)|kite]]. By [[Brahmagupta's theorem]], in an orthodiagonal quadrilateral that is also [[cyclic quadrilateral|cyclic]], a line through the midpoint of one side and through the intersection point of the diagonals is perpendicular to the opposite side.\n\nBy [[van Aubel's theorem]], if squares are constructed externally on the sides of a quadrilateral, the line segments connecting the centers of opposite squares are perpendicular and equal in length.\n\n==Lines in three dimensions==\n\nUp to three lines in [[three-dimensional space]] can be pairwise perpendicular, as exemplified by the ''x, y'', and ''z'' axes of a three-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Tangential and normal components]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation |first1=Nathan |last1=Altshiller-Court |year=1925 |lccn=52-13504 |title=College Geometry:  An Introduction to the Modern Geometry of the Triangle and the Circle |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]] |location=New York}}\n* {{citation |first1=David C. |last1=Kay |year=1969 |lccn=69-12075 |title=College Geometry |publisher=[[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] |location=New York}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.mathopenref.com/perpendicular.html Definition: perpendicular] with interactive animation.\n*[http://www.mathopenref.com/constbisectline.html How to draw a perpendicular bisector of a line with compass and straight edge] (animated demonstration).\n*[http://www.mathopenref.com/constperpendray.html How to draw a perpendicular at the endpoint of a ray with compass and straight edge] (animated demonstration).\n\n[[Category:Elementary geometry]]\n[[Category:Orientation (geometry)]]\n", "name_user": "24.0.100.8", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular"}
