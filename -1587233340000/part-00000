As a leading man for all but the first three years of his cinematic career, Scott appeared in a variety of genres, including social dramas, crime dramas, [[comedies]], [[musicals]] (albeit in non-singing and non-dancing roles), adventure tales, [[war films]], and a few [[Horror film|horror]] and [[fantasy]] films. However, his most enduring image is that of the tall-in-the-saddle [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. Out of his more than 100 film appearances over 60 were in Westerns; thus, \"of all the major stars whose name was associated with the Western, Scott most closely identified with it.\"<ref name=\"BFI\">Boscombe 1988.{{page needed|date=July 2016}}</ref>\n\nScott's more than 30 years as a motion picture actor resulted in his working with many acclaimed screen directors, including [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]], [[Rouben Mamoulian]], [[Michael Curtiz]], [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]], [[King Vidor]], [[Allan Dwan]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[Sam Peckinpah]], [[Henry Hathaway]] (eight times), [[Ray Enright]] (seven), [[Edwin L. Marin]] (seven), [[Andre DeToth]] (six), and most notably, his seven film collaborations with [[Budd Boetticher]]. Scott also worked with a diverse array of cinematic leading ladies, from [[Shirley Temple]] and [[Irene Dunne]] to [[Mae West]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]].\n\nTall (6&nbsp;ft 2\u00bd in; 189&nbsp;cm), lanky and handsome, Scott displayed an easygoing charm and courtly Southern drawl in his early films that helped offset his limitations as an actor, where he was frequently found to be stiff or \"lumbering\".<ref>Mueller 1985, p. 65.</ref> As he matured, however, Scott's acting improved while his features became burnished and leathery, turning him into the ideal \"strong, silent\" type of stoic hero. ''The BFI Companion to the Western'' noted:<blockquote>In his earlier Westerns&nbsp;... the Scott persona is debonair, easy-going, graceful, though with the necessary hint of steel. As he matures into his fifties his roles change. Increasingly Scott becomes the man who has seen it all, who has suffered pain, loss, and hardship, and who has now achieved (but at what cost?) a stoic calm proof against vicissitude.<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Scott was a consistent box-office draw. In the annual ''Motion Picture Herald'' [[Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll|Top Ten Polls]], he ranked 10th in 1950, seventh in 1951, and 10th in both 1952 and 1953.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 4.</ref> Scott also appeared in the Quigley's ''Top Ten Money Makers Poll'' from 1950 to 1953.<ref>[http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html \"Top Ten Money Making Stars of the past 79 years.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221063625/http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |date=2014-12-21 }} ''quigleypublishing.com.'' Retrieved: June 9, 2012.</ref>\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early years==\nScott was born in [[Orange County, Virginia]], but reared in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], the second of six children born to parents of Scottish descent. His father was George Grant Scott, born in [[Franklin, Virginia]], an administrative engineer in a textile firm. His mother was Lucille Crane Scott, born in [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]], Virginia, a member of a wealthy North Carolina family.<ref name=\"Nott p. 7\">Nott 2004, p. 7.</ref> The Scott children in order of birth were: Margaret, Randolph, Katherine, Virginia, Joseph and Barbara, most born in North Carolina.<ref>U.S. Census 1900\u20131920.</ref>\n\nBecause of his family's financial status, young Randolph was able to attend private schools such as [[Woodberry Forest School]]. From an early age, Scott developed and displayed his athleticism, excelling in [[american football|football]], baseball, horse racing, and swimming.<ref name=\"Nott p. 7\"/>\n\n==World War I==\nIn April 1917, the United States entered [[World War I]] and shortly afterwards, Scott, then  19 years old, joined the [[United States Army]]. He served in France as an artillery observer with the 2nd Trench Mortar Battalion, [[19th Field Artillery Regiment]].<ref>Nott 2004, p. 1.</ref> His wartime experience gave him training that was put to use in his later film career,  including [[horsemanship]] and the use of [[firearms]].\n\n==After World War I==\nAfter the [[Armistice]] brought [[World War I]] to an end, Scott stayed in France and  enrolled in an artillery officers' school. Although he eventually received a commission, Scott decided to return to America and thus journeyed home around 1919.<ref name=\"Nott p. 8\">Nott 2004, p. 8.</ref>\n\nWith his military career over, Scott continued his education at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order and set his sights on becoming an all-American football player. However a back injury prevented him from achieving this goal.<ref name=\"Thomas\">Thomas 1981 {{page needed|date=July 2016}}</ref> Scott then transferred to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], where he majored in [[textile engineering]] and manufacturing.<ref name=\"Nott p. 8\"/> As with his military career, however, he eventually dropped out of college and went to work as an accountant in the textile firm where his father was employed.<ref>Ringgold, Gene. \"Randolph Scott: Everyone's Idea of a Southern Gentleman.\" ''Films in Review.'' 1972.</ref>\n\n==Stage and early film appearances==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Early films===\nAround 1927, Scott developed an interest in acting and decided to make his way to Los Angeles and seek a career in the motion picture industry. Fortunately, Scott's father had become acquainted with [[Howard Hughes]] and provided a letter of introduction for his son to present to the eccentric millionaire filmmaker.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Hughes responded by getting Scott a small part in a [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] film called ''[[Sharp Shooters]]'' (1928). Despite its title and the presence of O'Brien, ''Sharp Shooters'' is not a western, as some film historians claimed. Rather, it's a romantic comedy. A print of the film survives in the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].\n\nIn the next few years, Scott continued working as an extra and bit player in several films, including ''Weary River'' (1929) with [[Richard Barthelmess]], ''[[The Far Call]]'' (1929), ''[[The Black Watch]]'' (1929) (directed by [[John Ford]] with [[John Wayne]] also uncredited) and uncredited as the Rider in ''[[The Virginian (1929 film)|The Virginian]]'' (1929) with [[Gary Cooper]]. Reputedly, Scott also served as Cooper's dialect coach in this latter film.\n\nScott was also uncredited on ''[[Dynamite (1929 film)|Dynamite]]'' (1929) directed by [[Cecil B. De Mille]], and ''[[Born Reckless (1930 film)|Born Reckless]]'' (1930).\n\n===Stage===\nOn the advice of director [[Cecil B. DeMille]], Scott gained much-needed acting experience by performing in stage plays with the [[Pasadena Playhouse]]. Scott's stage roles during this period include:<ref>Nott 2004, p. 136.</ref>\n* A minister in ''Gentlemen Be Seated''\n* A butler in ''Nellie, the Beautiful Model''\n* Metellus Cimber in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''\n* Hector Malone in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Man and Superman]]''\n\nIn 1931 Scott played his first leading role (with [[Sally Blane]]) in ''[[Women Men Marry]]'' (1931), a [[lost film|film]], now apparently lost, that was made by a [[Poverty Row]] studio called Headline Pictures. A silent film by the same name from 1922, directed by Edward Dillon, has apparently been preserved, however, at Filmmuseum Amsterdam. The Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog:..Women Men Marry.\n\nHe followed that movie with a supporting part in a [[Warner Bros.]] production starring [[George Arliss]], ''[[A Successful Calamity]]'' (1932).\n\nIn 1932 Scott appeared in a play at the Vine Street Theatre in [[Hollywood]] entitled ''Under a Virginia Moon''. His performance in this play resulted in several offers for screen tests by the major movie studios.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Scott eventually signed a seven-year contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] at a salary of USD $400 per week ({{Inflation|USD|400|1932|r=-2|fmt=eq}}).<ref>Nott 2004, p. 10.</ref>\n\n==Paramount==\n===Zane Grey apprenticeship===\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 02.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Verna Hillie]] in ''[[Man of the Forest (1933 film)|Man of the Forest]]'', 1933]]\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 05 (1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Barton MacLane]], [[Tom Kennedy (actor)|Tom Kennedy]], [[Noah Beery, Sr.]], Scott and [[Verna Hillie]] in ''Man of the Forest'', 1933]]\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 09.jpg|thumb|right|[[Noah Beery, Sr.]] and Scott in ''Man of the Forest'', 1933]]\nScott's first role under his new [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] contract was a small supporting part in a comedy called ''[[Sky Bride]]'' (1932) starring [[Richard Arlen]] and [[Jack Oakie]].\n\nFollowing that, however, Paramount cast him as the lead in ''[[Heritage of the Desert (1932 film)|Heritage of the Desert]]'' (1932), his first significant starring role and also the one that established him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. As with ''Women Men Marry'', [[Sally Blane]] was his leading lady. [[Henry Hathaway]] made his directorial debut with ''Heritage of the Desert''. The film was popular and Scott would go on to make ten \"B\" [[Western (genre)|Western]] films loosely based on the novels of [[Zane Grey]].\n\n(Around the same time, [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]] also remade some [[Zane Grey]] titles that they owned, with [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] as their star.)\n\nMany of these Grey adaptations were remakes of earlier silent films. In an effort to save on production costs, Paramount utilized stock footage from the silent version and even hired some of the same actors, such as [[Raymond Hatton]] and [[Noah Beery, Sr.|Noah Beery]], to repeat their roles. For the 1933 films ''[[The Thundering Herd (1933 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' and ''[[Man of the Forest]]'', Scott's hair was darkened and he sported a trim moustache so that he could easily be matched to footage of [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], the star of the silent versions.\n\nIn his book, ''The Hollywood Western: Ninety Years of Cowboys and Indians, Train Robbers, Sheriffs and Gunslingers'', film historian [[William K. Everson]] refers to the Zane Grey series as being \"uniformly good\".<ref name=\"Everson\">Everson, William K. ''The Hollywood Western: Ninety Years of Cowboys and Indians, Train Robbers, Sheriffs and Gunslingers.'' New York. Citadel Press, 1992, First edition 1969.</ref> He also writes:<blockquote>''To the Last Man'' was almost a model of its kind, an exceptionally strong story of feuding families in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, with a cast worthy of an \"A\" feature, excellent direction by [[Henry Hathaway]], and an unusual climactic fight between the villain (Jack LaRue) and the ''heroine'' ([[Esther Ralston]], in an exceptionally appealing performance).\n\n''Sunset Pass''...&nbsp;was not only one of the best but also one of the most surprising in presenting Randolph Scott and [[Harry Carey (actor born 1878)|Harry Carey]] as ''heavies.''</blockquote>\n\nThe Zane Grey series were a boon for Scott, as they provided him with \"an excellent training ground for both action and acting\".<ref>Nott 2005, p. 9.</ref>\n\nIn between his work in the Zane Grey [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, Paramount cast Scott in several non-[[Western (genre)|Western]] roles, such as \"the other man\" in ''[[Hot Saturday]]'' (1932), with [[Nancy Carroll]] and [[Cary Grant]].\n\nScott returned to Zane Grey Westerns with ''[[Wild Horse Mesa (1932 film)|Wild Horse Mesa]]'' (1932), then was the romantic male lead in ''[[Hello, Everybody!]]'' (1933), an odd one-shot attempt to make a film star out of the popular but heavy-set radio singer [[Kate Smith]].\n\n''[[The Thundering Herd (1933 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' (1933) was another Zane Grey Western with Hathaway, then he was in two horror movies, ''[[Murders in the Zoo]]'' (1933) with [[Lionel Atwill]] and ''[[Supernatural (film)|Supernatural]]'' (1933) with [[Carole Lombard]].\n\nAfter the Western ''[[Sunset Pass (1933 film)|Sunset Pass]]'' (1933), Paramount loaned Scott to [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], to play [[Bebe Daniels]]'s love interest in a minor romantic comedy called ''[[Cocktail Hour (film)|Cocktail Hour]]'' (1933).\n\nBack at Paramount Scott did the Westerns ''[[Man of the Forest]]'' (1933) and ''[[To the Last Man (1933 film)|To the Last Man]]'' (1933), both with Hathaway from Grey novels. He was loaned to [[Monogram Pictures]] for ''[[Broken Dreams (1933 film)|Broken Dreams]]'' (1933) then was back with Hathaway for ''[[The Last Round-Up (1934 film)|The Last Round-Up]]'' (1934).\n\nScott did three more Zane Grey Westerns without Hathaway: ''[[Wagon Wheels (film)|Wagon Wheels]]'' (1934) directed by [[Charles Barton (director)|Charles Barton]], ''[[Home on the Range (1935 film)|Home on the Range]]'' (1935) from [[Arthur Jacobson]], and ''[[Rocky Mountain Mystery]]'' (1935) with Barton.\n\n===RKO and \"A\" Films===\nParamount loaned Scott to [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] to support [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Irene Dunne]] in ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), a hugely popular adaptation of the Broadway musical.\n\nRKO liked Scott and kept him on for ''[[Village Tale]]'' (1935), directed by John Cromwell, and ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'' (1935), an adaptation of [[She (novel)|the classic novel]] by [[H. Rider Haggard]] from the makers of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''.\n\nScott went back to Paramount for ''[[So Red the Rose (film)|So Red the Rose]]'' (1935) with [[Margaret Sullavan]], then was reunited with Astaire and Rogers at RKO in ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936).<ref>Nott 2004, p. 43.</ref> It was another big hit.<ref name=\"rko\">Richard Jewel, 'RKO Film Grosses: 1931-1951', ''Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television'', Vol 14 No 1, 1994 p55</ref>\n\nScott was in a car drama at Paramount, ''[[And Sudden Death]]'' (1936), directed by Barton, then was loaned to independent producer [[Edward Small]], to play [[Natty Bumppo|Hawkeye]] in another adventure classic, ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1936 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'', adapted from the 1826 [[The Last of the Mohicans|novel]] by [[James Fenimore Cooper]]. A big hit in its day, the film \"gave Scott his first unqualified 'A' picture success as a lead.\"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 58.</ref>\n\nParamount now only put Scott in \"A\" films. He was a love interest for [[Mae West]] in ''[[Go West, Young Man]]'' (1936) and was reunited with Irene Dunne in a musical, ''[[High, Wide, and Handsome]]'' (1937). This last film, a musical directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], featured Scott in his \"most ambitious performance,\"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 59.</ref> The film is&nbsp;...\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;set in 1859 in [[Pennsylvania]], and follows the exploits of oil prospector Scott as he struggles against various varmints and vested interests out to wreck his business, and tries to keep his marriage to [[Irene Dunne]] intact, despite the tempting presence of saloon singer [[Dorothy Lamour]].<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nScott went to [[20th Century Fox]] to play the romantic male lead in a [[Shirley Temple]] film, ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1938). At Paramount he made a well budgeted Western ''[[The Texans]]'' (1938) with [[Joan Bennett]] then he starred in ''[[The Road to Reno (1938 film)|The Road to Reno]]'' (1938) at Universal.\n\nOne missed opportunity came about around this time. Due to his Southern background, Scott was considered for the role of [[Ashley Wilkes]] in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', but it was [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] who eventually got the part.\n\n==20th Century Fox==\nScott's contract with Paramount ended and he signed a deal with Fox. They put him in ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' (1939), a lavish highly romanticized account of the famous [[Jesse James|outlaw]] ([[Tyrone Power]]) and his brother [[Frank James|Frank]] ([[Henry Fonda]]). Scott was billed fourth as a sympathetic marshal after the James brothers; it was his first film in color.\n\nScott was reunited with Temple in ''[[Susannah of the Mounties (film)|Susannah of the Mounties]]'' (1939), Temple's last profitable film for Fox. The studio gave him the lead in ''[[Frontier Marshal (1939 film)|Frontier Marshal]]'' (1939), playing [[Wyatt Earp]].\n\nScott went to Columbia to star in a medium budget action film, ''[[Coast Guard (film)|Coast Guard]]'' (1939). Back at Fox he was in a war movie, ''[[20,000 Men a Year]]'' (1939).\n\nScott went over to Warner Bros to make ''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]'' (1940), billed third after [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Miriam Hopkins]], playing Flynn's antagonist, a Confederate officer - but a sympathetic one, and not the actual villain (he was played by [[Humphrey Bogart]]). There were frequent disputes between director [[Michael Curtiz]], actors and producer [[Hal Wallis]] about script changes. But Curtiz recalled that Scott tried to stay out of those arguments: \"Randy Scott is a complete anachronism,\" said Curtiz. \"He's a gentleman. And so far he's the only one I've met in this business...\"<ref name=\"Nott 2004 p. 84\">Nott 2004 p. 84</ref> According to Nott, Curtiz and Scott got along well both personally and creatively, with Scott giving one of the top performances in his career.<ref name=\"Nott 2004 p. 84\"/>\n\nScott went back to RKO to play the \"other man\" role in the [[Irene Dunne]]\u2013[[Cary Grant]] romantic comedy ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940), a huge hit for RKO. For [[Universal Studios|Universal]], he starred with [[Kay Francis]] in ''[[When the Daltons Rode]]'' (1940).\n\nBack at Fox, Scott returned to [[Zane Grey]] country by co-starring with [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] in the [[Technicolor]] production ''[[Western Union (film)|Western Union]]'', directed by [[Fritz Lang]]. Scott played a \"good bad man\" in this film and gave one of his finest performances. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:\n<blockquote>Randolph Scott, who begins to look and act more and more like [[William S. Hart]], herein shapes one of the truest and most appreciable characters of his career as the party's scout.<ref>''[[The New York Times]],'' February 7, 1941.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1941, Scott also co-starred with a young [[Gene Tierney]] in another western, ''[[Belle Starr (film)|Belle Starr]]''.  After a spy film with [[Elisabeth Bergner]], ''[[Paris Calling]]'' (1941), he was in a hugely popular war film at Fox with John Payne and [[Maureen O'Hara]], ''[[To the Shores of Tripoli]]'' (1942).\n\n==Universal==\nScott's only role as a truly evil villain was in [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'' (1942), an adaptation of [[Rex Beach]]'s 1905 tale of the [[Klondike gold rush|Alaskan gold rush]] also starring [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[John Wayne]]. \n\nThe [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]]-Scott-[[John Wayne|Wayne]] combination led to [[Universal Studios|Universal]] casting the trio that same year in ''[[Pittsburgh (1942 film)|Pittsburgh]]'', a war-time action-melodrama.  Scott was billed above Wayne in both films but Wayne actually played the heroic [[leading man]] roles and enjoyed more screen time in each movie.\n\n==World War II==\nShortly after the United States entered World War II, Scott attempted to obtain an officer's commission in the [[United States Marines|Marines]], but because of a back injury years earlier, he was rejected.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> However, he did his part for the war effort by touring in a comedy act with [[Joe DeRita]] (who later became a member of [[the Three Stooges]]) for the Victory Committee showcases, and he also raised food for the government on a ranch that he owned.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 67.</ref>\n\nIn 1942 and 1943, Scott appeared in several war films, notably ''To the Shores of Tripoli'' (1942) at Fox, ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' (1943) at RKO, the Canadian warship drama ''[[Corvette K-225]]'' (1943) (produced by [[Howard Hawks]]), ''[[Gung Ho! (1943 film)|Gung Ho!]]'' at Universal <ref>{{Citation|title=Bugs Bunny-War Bonds|date=1943|url=https://archive.org/details/GungHo-1943Trailer|accessdate=2017-09-21}}</ref> and ''[[China Sky (film)|China Sky]]'' (1945) at RKO.\n\nHe also made ''[[The Desperadoes]]'' (1943), [[Columbia Pictures]]' first feature in [[Technicolor]]. The film was produced by [[Harry Joe Brown]], with whom Scott would form a business partnership several years later.\n\nScott was one of many Universal stars who made a cameo in ''[[Follow the Boys]]'' (1944). He was in a \"northern\" with [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], ''[[Belle of the Yukon]]'' (1944), and made a [[swashbuckler]] film for producer [[Benedict Bogeaus]] alongside [[Charles Laughton]]: the cheaply made production ''[[Captain Kidd (1945 film)|Captain Kidd]]'' (1945).\n\n==Post-World War II career==\n===Tall in the saddle===\n[[File:Abilene Town 1946 (2).jpg|thumb|With Jack Lambert in ''Abilene Town'', 1946]]\nIn 1946, after playing roles that had him wandering in and out of the saddle for many years, Scott appeared in ''[[Abilene Town]]'', a [[United Artists|UA]]<ref>Gritten  2008, p. 8.</ref> release which cast him in what would become one of his classic images, the fearless lawman cleaning up a lawless town. The film \"cemented Scott's position as a cowboy hero\"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 15.</ref> and from this point on all but two of his starring films would be [[Westerns]]. The Scott Westerns of the late 1940s would each be budgeted around US$1,000,000, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1946|r=-5}}}} today. Scott mostly made Westerns for producers [[Nat Holt]] or [[Harry Joe Brown]] or at [[Warner Bros]], although he did make ''[[Albuquerque (film)|Albuquerque]]'' (1948) at Paramount.\n\n===Non-Westerns===\nScott's last non-Westerns were a mystery with [[Peggy Ann Garner]] at Fox, ''[[Home Sweet Homicide]]'' (1947), and a family drama for Bogeaus, ''[[Christmas Eve (1947 film)|Christmas Eve]]'' (1947). He also had a cameo in Warners' ''[[Starlift]]'' (1951).\n\n===Nat Holt===\nScott did two Westerns for Nat Holt at RKO, ''[[Badman's Territory]]'' (1946) and ''[[Trail Street]]'' (1947). He followed it with another pair for Holt at that studio, ''[[Return of the Bad Men]]'' (1948) at RKO and ''[[Canadian Pacific (film)|Canadian Pacific]]'' (1949), then they did ''[[Fighting Man of the Plains]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Cariboo Trail]]'' (1950) at Fox.\n\nScott also made ''[[Rage at Dawn]]'' in 1955 for Nat Holt, which was released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] starring Scott and [[Forrest Tucker]], and featuring [[Denver Pyle]], [[Edgar Buchanan]], and [[J. Carrol Naish]]. It purports to tell the true story of the [[Reno Gang|Reno Brothers]], an outlaw gang which terrorized the American Midwest, particularly Southern [[Indiana]], soon after the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===Harry Joe Brown===\nScott renewed his acquaintance with producer [[Harry Joe Brown]] at Columbia with ''[[Gunfighters (film)|Gunfighters]]'' (1947). They began producing many of Scott's Westerns, including several that were shot in the two-color [[Cinecolor]] process. Their collaboration resulted in the film ''[[Coroner Creek]]'' (1948) with Scott as a vengeance-driven cowpoke who \"predates the [[Budd Boetticher]]/[[Burt Kennedy]] heroes by nearly a decade,\"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 29.</ref> and ''[[The Walking Hills]]'' (1949), a modern-day tale of gold hunters directed by [[John Sturges]].\n\nThey followed it with ''[[The Doolins of Oklahoma]]'' (1949), ''[[The Nevadan]]'' (1950), ''[[Santa Fe (film)|Santa Fe]]'' (1951), ''[[Man in the Saddle (1951 film)|Man in the Saddle]]'' (1951), ''[[Hangman's Knot]]'' (1952), ''[[The Stranger Wore a Gun]]'' (1953) (shot in 3-D), ''[[Ten Wanted Men]]'' (1955), and ''[[A Lawless Street]]'' (1955) (with [[Angela Lansbury]].)\n\n===Warner Bros.===\nScott did ''[[Colt .45 (film)|Colt .45]]'' (1950) at [[Warner Bros.]] where his salary was US$100,000 per picture (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1949|r=-5}}}} today). He stayed at the studio to do ''[[Sugarfoot (film)|Sugarfoot]]'' (1951), ''[[Fort Worth (film)|Fort Worth]]'' (1951), ''[[Carson City (film)|Carson City]]'' (1952), ''[[The Man Behind the Gun]]'' (1953), ''[[Thunder Over the Plains]]'' (1953), ''[[Riding Shotgun (film)|Riding Shotgun]]'' (1954), ''[[Tall Man Riding]]'' (1955) Most of  these were directed by [[Andr\u00e9 de Toth]].\n\nAlso of interest is ''[[Shootout at Medicine Bend]]'' shot in 1955, but released in 1957, which was Scott's last movie in black and white. The movie co-stars [[James Garner]] and [[Angie Dickinson]].<ref>Gritten 2008, p. 1071.</ref>\n\nBy 1956, Scott turned 58, an age where the careers of most leading men would be winding down. Scott, however, was about to enter his finest and most acclaimed period.\n\n===Boetticher and Kennedy films===\n[[File:Nancy Gates and Randolph Scott in Comanche Station.png|thumb|upright=1.3|With Nancy Gates in ''[[Comanche Station]]'', 1960]]\nIn 1955, screenwriter [[Burt Kennedy]] wrote a script entitled ''[[Seven Men from Now]]'' which was scheduled to be filmed by [[John Wayne]]'s [[Batjac Productions]] with Wayne as the film's star and [[Budd Boetticher]] as its director. However, Wayne was already committed to [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''. Wayne therefore suggested Scott as his replacement.<ref>Nott 2005, p. 131.</ref> The resulting film, released in 1956, did not make a great impact at the time but is now regarded by many as one of Scott's best, as well as the one that launched Scott and Boetticher into a successful collaboration that totaled seven films.\n\nWhile each film is independent and there are no shared characters or settings, this set of films is often called the Ranown Cycle, for the production company run by Scott and Harry Joe Brown, which was involved in their production.<ref>Wilmington, Michael. [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-29/entertainment/ca-2438_1_budd-boetticher \"Tall in the director's chair Budd Boetticher made some of the best-remembered westerns of '50s and '60s; they don't make 'em like that (or him) anymore.\"] ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 29, 1992, p. 4.</ref> Kennedy scripted four of them. In these films&nbsp;...\n<blockquote>Boetticher achieved works of great beauty, formally precise in structure and visually elegant, notably for their use of the distinctive landscape of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|California Sierras]]. As the hero of these \"floating poker games\" (as [[Andrew Sarris]] calls them), Scott tempers their innately pessimistic view with quiet, stoical humour, as he pits his wits against such charming villains as [[Richard Boone]] in ''[[The Tall T]]'' and [[Claude Akins]] in ''[[Comanche Station]].''<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter ''[[7th Cavalry (film)|7th Cavalry]]'' (1956), Boetticher, Kennedy and Scott were reunited for their second film, ''[[The Tall T]]'' (1957) which co-starred [[Richard Boone]].\n\nThe third in the series was ''[[Decision at Sundown]]'' (1957), although that script was not written by Kennedy. The unofficial series continued with ''[[Buchanan Rides Alone]]'' (1958).\n\n''[[Westbound (film)|Westbound]]'' (1959) is not considered part of the official cycle although Boetticher directed it. However the last two, both written by Kennedy, definitely were: ''[[Ride Lonesome]]'' (1959) and ''[[Comanche Station]]'' (1960)\n\n===Last film: ''Ride the High Country''===\nIn 1962 Scott made his final film appearance in ''[[Ride the High Country]]'', a film now regarded as a classic. It was directed by [[Sam Peckinpah]] and co-starred [[Joel McCrea]], an actor who had a screen image similar to Scott's and who also from the mid-1940s on devoted his career almost exclusively to [[Westerns]].\n\n<blockquote>Scott and [[Joel McCrea|McCrea's]] farewell Western is characterized by a nostalgic sense of the passing of the Old West; a preoccupation with the emotionality of male bonding and of the experiential 'gap' between the young and the old; and the fearful evocation, in the form of the Hammonds (the villains in the film), of these preoccupations transmuted into brutal and perverse forms.<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>[[Joel McCrea|McCrea]], like Scott, retired from filmmaking after this picture, although he returned to the screen twice in later years.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriages===\nScott married twice. In 1936, he became the second husband of heiress [[Marion duPont Scott|Marion duPont]], daughter of William Du Pont Sr., and great-granddaughter of \u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Du Pont de Nemours, the founder of the [[E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]]. Marion had previously married George Somerville, with Scott serving as best man at the wedding. The Scotts' marriage ended in divorce three years later, in 1939. The union produced no children. Though divorced, she kept his last name nearly five decades, until her death in 1983.<ref>Sargent, Sarah.

As a leading man for all but the first three years of his cinematic career, Scott appeared in a variety of genres, including social dramas, crime dramas, [[comedies]], [[musicals]] (albeit in non-singing and non-dancing roles), adventure tales, [[war films]], and a few [[Horror film|horror]] and [[fantasy]] films. However, his most enduring image is that of the tall-in-the-saddle [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. Out of his more than 100 film appearances over 60 were in Westerns; thus, \"of all the major stars whose name was associated with the Western, Scott most closely identified with it.\"<ref name=\"BFI\">Boscombe 1988.{{page needed|date=July 2016}}</ref>\n\nScott's more than 30 years as a motion picture actor resulted in his working with many acclaimed screen directors, including [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]], [[Rouben Mamoulian]], [[Michael Curtiz]], [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]], [[King Vidor]], [[Allan Dwan]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[Sam Peckinpah]], [[Henry Hathaway]] (eight times), [[Ray Enright]] (seven), [[Edwin L. Marin]] (seven), [[Andre DeToth]] (six), and most notably, his seven film collaborations with [[Budd Boetticher]]. Scott also worked with a diverse array of cinematic leading ladies, from [[Shirley Temple]] and [[Irene Dunne]] to [[Mae West]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]].\n\nTall (6&nbsp;ft 2\u00bd in; 189&nbsp;cm), lanky and handsome, Scott displayed an easygoing charm and courtly Southern drawl in his early films that helped offset his limitations as an actor, where he was frequently found to be stiff or \"lumbering\".<ref>Mueller 1985, p. 65.</ref> As he matured, however, Scott's acting improved while his features became burnished and leathery, turning him into the ideal \"strong, silent\" type of stoic hero. ''The BFI Companion to the Western'' noted:<blockquote>In his earlier Westerns&nbsp;... the Scott persona is debonair, easy-going, graceful, though with the necessary hint of steel. As he matures into his fifties his roles change. Increasingly Scott becomes the man who has seen it all, who has suffered pain, loss, and hardship, and who has now achieved (but at what cost?) a stoic calm proof against vicissitude.<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Scott was a consistent box-office draw. In the annual ''Motion Picture Herald'' [[Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll|Top Ten Polls]], he ranked 10th in 1950, seventh in 1951, and 10th in both 1952 and 1953.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 4.</ref> Scott also appeared in the Quigley's ''Top Ten Money Makers Poll'' from 1950 to 1953.<ref>[http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html \"Top Ten Money Making Stars of the past 79 years.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221063625/http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |date=2014-12-21 }} ''quigleypublishing.com.''

From an early age, Scott developed and displayed his athleticism, excelling in [[american football|football]], baseball, horse racing, and swimming.<ref name=\"Nott p. 7\"/>\n\n==World War I==\nIn April 1917, the United States entered [[World War I]] and shortly afterwards, Scott, then  19 years old, joined the [[United States Army]]. He served in France as an artillery observer with the 2nd Trench Mortar Battalion, [[19th Field Artillery Regiment]].<ref>Nott 2004, p. 1.</ref> His wartime experience gave him training that was put to use in his later film career,  including [[horsemanship]] and the use of [[firearms]].\n\n==After World War I==\nAfter the [[Armistice]] brought [[World War I]] to an end, Scott stayed in France and  enrolled in an artillery officers' school.

Fortunately, Scott's father had become acquainted with [[Howard Hughes]] and provided a letter of introduction for his son to present to the eccentric millionaire filmmaker.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Hughes responded by getting Scott a small part in a [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] film called ''[[Sharp Shooters]]'' (1928). Despite its title and the presence of O'Brien, ''Sharp Shooters'' is not a western, as some film historians claimed. Rather, it's a romantic comedy. A print of the film survives in the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].\n\nIn the next few years, Scott continued working as an extra and bit player in several films, including ''Weary River'' (1929) with [[Richard Barthelmess]], ''[[The Far Call]]'' (1929), ''[[The Black Watch]]'' (1929) (directed by [[John Ford]] with [[John Wayne]] also uncredited) and uncredited as the Rider in ''[[The Virginian (1929 film)|The Virginian]]'' (1929) with [[Gary Cooper]]. Reputedly, Scott also served as Cooper's dialect coach in this latter film.\n\nScott was also uncredited on ''[[Dynamite (1929 film)|Dynamite]]'' (1929) directed by [[Cecil B. De Mille]], and ''[[Born Reckless (1930 film)|Born Reckless]]'' (1930).\n\n===Stage===\nOn the advice of director [[Cecil B. DeMille]], Scott gained much-needed acting experience by performing in stage plays with the [[Pasadena Playhouse]]. Scott's stage roles during this period include:<ref>Nott 2004, p. 136.</ref>\n* A minister in ''Gentlemen Be Seated''\n* A butler in ''Nellie, the Beautiful Model''\n* Metellus Cimber in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''\n* Hector Malone in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Man and Superman]]''\n\nIn 1931 Scott played his first leading role (with [[Sally Blane]]) in ''[[Women Men Marry]]'' (1931), a [[lost film|film]], now apparently lost, that was made by a [[Poverty Row]] studio called Headline Pictures.

His performance in this play resulted in several offers for screen tests by the major movie studios.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Scott eventually signed a seven-year contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] at a salary of USD $400 per week ({{Inflation|USD|400|1932|r=-2|fmt=eq}}).<ref>Nott 2004, p. 10.</ref>\n\n==Paramount==\n===Zane Grey apprenticeship===\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 02.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Verna Hillie]] in ''[[Man of the Forest]]'', 1933]]\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 05 (1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Barton MacLane]], [[Tom Kennedy (actor)|Tom Kennedy]], [[Noah Beery, Sr.]], Scott and [[Verna Hillie]] in ''Man of the Forest'', 1933]]\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 09.jpg|thumb|right|[[Noah Beery, Sr.]] and Scott in ''Man of the Forest'', 1933]]\nScott's first role under his new [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] contract was a small supporting part in a comedy called ''[[Sky Bride]]'' (1932) starring [[Richard Arlen]] and [[Jack Oakie]].\n\nFollowing that, however, Paramount cast him as the lead in ''[[Heritage of the Desert (1932 film)|Heritage of the Desert]]'' (1932), his first significant starring role and also the one that established him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. As with ''Women Men Marry'', [[Sally Blane]] was his leading lady. [[Henry Hathaway]] made his directorial debut with ''Heritage of the Desert''. The film was popular and Scott would go on to make ten \"B\" [[Western (genre)|Western]] films loosely based on the novels of [[Zane Grey]].\n\n(Around the same time, [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]] also remade some [[Zane Grey]] titles that they owned, with [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] as their star.)\n\nMany of these Grey adaptations were remakes of earlier silent films. In an effort to save on production costs, Paramount utilized stock footage from the silent version and even hired some of the same actors, such as [[Raymond Hatton]] and [[Noah Beery, Sr.|Noah Beery]], to repeat their roles. For the 1933 films ''[[The Thundering Herd (1933 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' and ''[[Man of the Forest]]'', Scott's hair was darkened and he sported a trim moustache so that he could easily be matched to footage of [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], the star of the silent versions.\n\nIn his book, ''The Hollywood Western: Ninety Years of Cowboys and Indians, Train Robbers, Sheriffs and Gunslingers'', film historian [[William K. Everson]] refers to the Zane Grey series as being \"uniformly good\".<ref name=\"Everson\">Everson, William K. ''The Hollywood Western: Ninety Years of Cowboys and Indians, Train Robbers, Sheriffs and Gunslingers.'' New York. Citadel Press, 1992, First edition 1969.</ref> He also writes:<blockquote>''To the Last Man'' was almost a model of its kind, an exceptionally strong story of feuding families in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, with a cast worthy of an \"A\" feature, excellent direction by [[Henry Hathaway]], and an unusual climactic fight between the villain (Jack LaRue) and the ''heroine'' ([[Esther Ralston]], in an exceptionally appealing performance).\n\n''Sunset Pass''...&nbsp;was not only one of the best but also one of the most surprising in presenting Randolph Scott and [[Harry Carey (actor born 1878)|Harry Carey]] as ''heavies.''</blockquote>\n\nThe Zane Grey series were a boon for Scott, as they provided him with \"an excellent training ground for both action and acting\".<ref>Nott 2005, p. 9.</ref>\n\nIn between his work in the Zane Grey [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, Paramount cast Scott in several non-[[Western (genre)|Western]] roles, such as \"the other man\" in ''[[Hot Saturday]]'' (1932), with [[Nancy Carroll]] and [[Cary Grant]].\n\nScott returned to Zane Grey Westerns with ''[[Wild Horse Mesa (1932 film)|Wild Horse Mesa]]'' (1932), then was the romantic male lead in ''[[Hello, Everybody!]]'' (1933), an odd one-shot attempt to make a film star out of the popular but heavy-set radio singer [[Kate Smith]].\n\n''[[The Thundering Herd (1933 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' (1933) was another Zane Grey Western with Hathaway, then he was in two horror movies, ''[[Murders in the Zoo]]'' (1933) with [[Lionel Atwill]] and ''[[Supernatural (film)|Supernatural]]'' (1933) with [[Carole Lombard]].\n\nAfter the Western ''[[Sunset Pass (1933 film)|Sunset Pass]]'' (1933), Paramount loaned Scott to [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], to play [[Bebe Daniels]]'s love interest in a minor romantic comedy called ''[[Cocktail Hour (film)|Cocktail Hour]]'' (1933).\n\nBack at Paramount Scott did the Westerns ''[[Man of the Forest]]'' (1933) and ''[[To the Last Man (1933 film)|To the Last Man]]'' (1933), both with Hathaway from Grey novels. He was loaned to [[Monogram Pictures]] for ''[[Broken Dreams (1933 film)|Broken Dreams]]'' (1933) then was back with Hathaway for ''[[The Last Round-Up (1934 film)|The Last Round-Up]]'' (1934).\n\nScott did three more Zane Grey Westerns without Hathaway: ''[[Wagon Wheels (film)|Wagon Wheels]]'' (1934) directed by [[Charles Barton (director)|Charles Barton]], ''[[Home on the Range (1935 film)|Home on the Range]]'' (1935) from [[Arthur Jacobson]], and ''[[Rocky Mountain Mystery]]'' (1935) with Barton.\n\n===RKO and \"A\" Films===\nParamount loaned Scott to [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] to support [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Irene Dunne]] in ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), a hugely popular adaptation of the Broadway musical.\n\nRKO liked Scott and kept him on for ''[[Village Tale]]'' (1935), directed by John Cromwell, and ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'' (1935), an adaptation of [[She (novel)|the classic novel]] by [[H. Rider Haggard]] from the makers of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''.\n\nScott went back to Paramount for ''[[So Red the Rose (film)|So Red the Rose]]'' (1935) with [[Margaret Sullavan]], then was reunited with Astaire and Rogers at RKO in ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936).<ref>Nott 2004, p. 43.</ref> It was another big hit.<ref name=\"rko\">Richard Jewel, 'RKO Film Grosses: 1931-1951', ''Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television'', Vol 14 No 1, 1994 p55</ref>\n\nScott was in a car drama at Paramount, ''[[And Sudden Death]]'' (1936), directed by Barton, then was loaned to independent producer [[Edward Small]], to play [[Natty Bumppo|Hawkeye]] in another adventure classic, ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1936 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'', adapted from the 1826 [[The Last of the Mohicans|novel]] by [[James Fenimore Cooper]]. A big hit in its day, the film \"gave Scott his first unqualified 'A' picture success as a lead.\"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 58.</ref>\n\nParamount now only put Scott in \"A\" films. He was a love interest for [[Mae West]] in ''[[Go West, Young Man]]'' (1936) and was reunited with Irene Dunne in a musical, ''[[High, Wide, and Handsome]]'' (1937). This last film, a musical directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], featured Scott in his \"most ambitious performance,\"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 59.</ref> The film is&nbsp;...\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;set in 1859 in [[Pennsylvania]], and follows the exploits of oil prospector Scott as he struggles against various varmints and vested interests out to wreck his business, and tries to keep his marriage to [[Irene Dunne]] intact, despite the tempting presence of saloon singer [[Dorothy Lamour]].<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nScott went to [[20th Century Fox]] to play the romantic male lead in a [[Shirley Temple]] film, ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1938). At Paramount he made a well budgeted Western ''[[The Texans]]'' (1938) with [[Joan Bennett]] then he starred in ''[[The Road to Reno (1938 film)|The Road to Reno]]'' (1938) at Universal.\n\nOne missed opportunity came about around this time. Due to his Southern background, Scott was considered for the role of [[Ashley Wilkes]] in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', but it was [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] who eventually got the part.\n\n==20th Century Fox==\nScott's contract with Paramount ended and he signed a deal with Fox. They put him in ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' (1939), a lavish highly romanticized account of the famous [[Jesse James|outlaw]] ([[Tyrone Power]]) and his brother [[Frank James|Frank]] ([[Henry Fonda]]). Scott was billed fourth as a sympathetic marshal after the James brothers; it was his first film in color.\n\nScott was reunited with Temple in ''[[Susannah of the Mounties (film)|Susannah of the Mounties]]'' (1939), Temple's last profitable film for Fox. The studio gave him the lead in ''[[Frontier Marshal (1939 film)|Frontier Marshal]]'' (1939), playing [[Wyatt Earp]].\n\nScott went to Columbia to star in a medium budget action film, ''[[Coast Guard (film)|Coast Guard]]'' (1939). Back at Fox he was in a war movie, ''[[20,000 Men a Year]]'' (1939).\n\nScott went over to Warner Bros to make ''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]'' (1940), billed third after [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Miriam Hopkins]], playing Flynn's antagonist, a Confederate officer - but a sympathetic one, and not the actual villain (he was played by [[Humphrey Bogart]]). There were frequent disputes between director [[Michael Curtiz]], actors and producer [[Hal Wallis]] about script changes. But Curtiz recalled that Scott tried to stay out of those arguments: \"Randy Scott is a complete anachronism,\" said Curtiz. \"He's a gentleman. And so far he's the only one I've met in this business...\"<ref name=\"Nott 2004 p. 84\">Nott 2004 p. 84</ref> According to Nott, Curtiz and Scott got along well both personally and creatively, with Scott giving one of the top performances in his career.<ref name=\"Nott 2004 p. 84\"/>\n\nScott went back to RKO to play the \"other man\" role in the [[Irene Dunne]]\u2013[[Cary Grant]] romantic comedy ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940), a huge hit for RKO. For [[Universal Studios|Universal]], he starred with [[Kay Francis]] in ''[[When the Daltons Rode]]'' (1940).\n\nBack at Fox, Scott returned to [[Zane Grey]] country by co-starring with [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] in the [[Technicolor]] production ''[[Western Union (film)|Western Union]]'', directed by [[Fritz Lang]]. Scott played a \"good bad man\" in this film and gave one of his finest performances. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:\n<blockquote>Randolph Scott, who begins to look and act more and more like [[William S. Hart]], herein shapes one of the truest and most appreciable characters of his career as the party's scout.<ref>''[[The New York Times]],'' February 7, 1941.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1941, Scott also co-starred with a young [[Gene Tierney]] in another western, ''[[Belle Starr (film)|Belle Starr]]''.  After a spy film with [[Elisabeth Bergner]], ''[[Paris Calling]]'' (1941), he was in a hugely popular war film at Fox with John Payne and [[Maureen O'Hara]], ''[[To the Shores of Tripoli]]'' (1942).\n\n==Universal==\nScott's only role as a truly evil villain was in [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'' (1942), an adaptation of [[Rex Beach]]'s 1905 tale of the [[Klondike gold rush|Alaskan gold rush]] also starring [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[John Wayne]]. \n\nThe [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]]-Scott-[[John Wayne|Wayne]] combination led to [[Universal Studios|Universal]] casting the trio that same year in ''[[Pittsburgh (1942 film)|Pittsburgh]]'', a war-time action-melodrama.  Scott was billed above Wayne in both films but Wayne actually played the heroic [[leading man]] roles and enjoyed more screen time in each movie.\n\n==World War II==\nShortly after the United States entered World War II, Scott attempted to obtain an officer's commission in the [[United States Marines|Marines]], but because of a back injury years earlier, he was rejected.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> However, he did his part for the war effort by touring in a comedy act with [[Joe DeRita]] (who later became a member of [[the Three Stooges]]) for the Victory Committee showcases, and he also raised food for the government on a ranch that he owned.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 67.</ref>\n\nIn 1942 and 1943, Scott appeared in several war films, notably ''To the Shores of Tripoli'' (1942) at Fox, ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' (1943) at RKO, the Canadian warship drama ''[[Corvette K-225]]'' (1943) (produced by [[Howard Hawks]]), ''[[Gung Ho! (1943 film)|Gung Ho!]]'' at Universal <ref>{{Citation|title=Bugs Bunny-War Bonds|date=1943|url=https://archive.org/details/GungHo-1943Trailer|accessdate=2017-09-21}}</ref> and ''[[China Sky (film)|China Sky]]'' (1945) at RKO.\n\nHe also made ''[[The Desperadoes]]'' (1943), [[Columbia Pictures]]' first feature in [[Technicolor]]. The film was produced by [[Harry Joe Brown]], with whom Scott would form a business partnership several years later.\n\nScott was one of many Universal stars who made a cameo in ''[[Follow the Boys]]'' (1944). He was in a \"northern\" with [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], ''[[Belle of the Yukon]]'' (1944), and made a [[swashbuckler]] film for producer [[Benedict Bogeaus]] alongside [[Charles Laughton]]: the cheaply made production ''[[Captain Kidd (1945 film)|Captain Kidd]]'' (1945).\n\n==Post-World War II career==\n===Tall in the saddle===\n[[File:Abilene Town 1946 (2).jpg|thumb|With Jack Lambert in ''Abilene Town'', 1946]]\nIn 1946, after playing roles that had him wandering in and out of the saddle for many years, Scott appeared in ''[[Abilene Town]]'', a [[United Artists|UA]]<ref>Gritten  2008, p. 8.</ref> release which cast him in what would become one of his classic images, the fearless lawman cleaning up a lawless town. The film \"cemented Scott's position as a cowboy hero\"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 15.</ref> and from this point on all but two of his starring films would be [[Westerns]]. The Scott Westerns of the late 1940s would each be budgeted around US$1,000,000, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1946|r=-5}}}} today. Scott mostly made Westerns for producers [[Nat Holt]] or [[Harry Joe Brown]] or at [[Warner Bros]], although he did make ''[[Albuquerque (film)|Albuquerque]]'' (1948) at Paramount.\n\n===Non-Westerns===\nScott's last non-Westerns were a mystery with [[Peggy Ann Garner]] at Fox, ''[[Home Sweet Homicide]]'' (1947), and a family drama for Bogeaus, ''[[Christmas Eve (1947 film)|Christmas Eve]]'' (1947). He also had a cameo in Warners' ''[[Starlift]]'' (1951).\n\n===Nat Holt===\nScott did two Westerns for Nat Holt at RKO, ''[[Badman's Territory]]'' (1946) and ''[[Trail Street]]'' (1947). He followed it with another pair for Holt at that studio, ''[[Return of the Bad Men]]'' (1948) at RKO and ''[[Canadian Pacific (film)|Canadian Pacific]]'' (1949), then they did ''[[Fighting Man of the Plains]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Cariboo Trail]]'' (1950) at Fox.\n\nScott also made ''[[Rage at Dawn]]'' in 1955 for Nat Holt, which was released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] starring Scott and [[Forrest Tucker]], and featuring [[Denver Pyle]], [[Edgar Buchanan]], and [[J. Carrol Naish]]. It purports to tell the true story of the [[Reno Gang|Reno Brothers]], an outlaw gang which terrorized the American Midwest, particularly Southern [[Indiana]], soon after the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===Harry Joe Brown===\nScott renewed his acquaintance with producer [[Harry Joe Brown]] at Columbia with ''[[Gunfighters (film)|Gunfighters]]'' (1947). They began producing many of Scott's Westerns, including several that were shot in the two-color [[Cinecolor]] process. Their collaboration resulted in the film ''[[Coroner Creek]]'' (1948) with Scott as a vengeance-driven cowpoke who \"predates the [[Budd Boetticher]]/[[Burt Kennedy]] heroes by nearly a decade,\"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 29.</ref> and ''[[The Walking Hills]]'' (1949), a modern-day tale of gold hunters directed by [[John Sturges]].\n\nThey followed it with ''[[The Doolins of Oklahoma]]'' (1949), ''[[The Nevadan]]'' (1950), ''[[Santa Fe (film)|Santa Fe]]'' (1951), ''[[Man in the Saddle (1951 film)|Man in the Saddle]]'' (1951), ''[[Hangman's Knot]]'' (1952), ''[[The Stranger Wore a Gun]]'' (1953) (shot in 3-D), ''[[Ten Wanted Men]]'' (1955), and ''[[A Lawless Street]]'' (1955) (with [[Angela Lansbury]].)\n\n===Warner Bros.===\nScott did ''[[Colt .45 (film)|Colt .45]]'' (1950) at [[Warner Bros.]] where his salary was US$100,000 per picture (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1949|r=-5}}}} today). He stayed at the studio to do ''[[Sugarfoot (film)|Sugarfoot]]'' (1951), ''[[Fort Worth (film)|Fort Worth]]'' (1951), ''[[Carson City (film)|Carson City]]'' (1952), ''[[The Man Behind the Gun]]'' (1953), ''[[Thunder Over the Plains]]'' (1953), ''[[Riding Shotgun (film)|Riding Shotgun]]'' (1954), ''[[Tall Man Riding]]'' (1955) Most of  these were directed by [[Andr\u00e9 de Toth]].\n\nAlso of interest is ''[[Shootout at Medicine Bend]]'' shot in 1955, but released in 1957, which was Scott's last movie in black and white. The movie co-stars [[James Garner]] and [[Angie Dickinson]].<ref>Gritten 2008, p. 1071.</ref>\n\nBy 1956, Scott turned 58, an age where the careers of most leading men would be winding down. Scott, however, was about to enter his finest and most acclaimed period.\n\n===Boetticher and Kennedy films===\n[[File:Nancy Gates and Randolph Scott in Comanche Station.png|thumb|upright=1.3|With Nancy Gates in ''[[Comanche Station]]'', 1960]]\nIn 1955, screenwriter [[Burt Kennedy]] wrote a script entitled ''[[Seven Men from Now]]'' which was scheduled to be filmed by [[John Wayne]]'s [[Batjac Productions]] with Wayne as the film's star and [[Budd Boetticher]] as its director. However, Wayne was already committed to [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''. Wayne therefore suggested Scott as his replacement.<ref>Nott 2005, p. 131.</ref> The resulting film, released in 1956, did not make a great impact at the time but is now regarded by many as one of Scott's best, as well as the one that launched Scott and Boetticher into a successful collaboration that totaled seven films.\n\nWhile each film is independent and there are no shared characters or settings, this set of films is often called the Ranown Cycle, for the production company run by Scott and Harry Joe Brown, which was involved in their production.<ref>Wilmington, Michael. [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-29/entertainment/ca-2438_1_budd-boetticher \"Tall in the director's chair Budd Boetticher made some of the best-remembered westerns of '50s and '60s; they don't make 'em like that (or him) anymore.\"] ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 29, 1992, p. 4.</ref> Kennedy scripted four of them. In these films&nbsp;...\n<blockquote>Boetticher achieved works of great beauty, formally precise in structure and visually elegant, notably for their use of the distinctive landscape of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|California Sierras]]. As the hero of these \"floating poker games\" (as [[Andrew Sarris]] calls them), Scott tempers their innately pessimistic view with quiet, stoical humour, as he pits his wits against such charming villains as [[Richard Boone]] in ''[[The Tall T]]'' and [[Claude Akins]] in ''[[Comanche Station]].''<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter ''[[7th Cavalry (film)|7th Cavalry]]'' (1956), Boetticher, Kennedy and Scott were reunited for their second film, ''[[The Tall T]]'' (1957) which co-starred [[Richard Boone]].\n\nThe third in the series was ''[[Decision at Sundown]]'' (1957), although that script was not written by Kennedy. The unofficial series continued with ''[[Buchanan Rides Alone]]'' (1958).\n\n''[[Westbound (film)|Westbound]]'' (1959) is not considered part of the official cycle although Boetticher directed it. However the last two, both written by Kennedy, definitely were: ''[[Ride Lonesome]]'' (1959) and ''[[Comanche Station]]'' (1960)\n\n===Last film: ''Ride the High Country''===\nIn 1962 Scott made his final film appearance in ''[[Ride the High Country]]'', a film now regarded as a classic. It was directed by [[Sam Peckinpah]] and co-starred [[Joel McCrea]], an actor who had a screen image similar to Scott's and who also from the mid-1940s on devoted his career almost exclusively to [[Westerns]].\n\n<blockquote>Scott and [[Joel McCrea|McCrea's]] farewell Western is characterized by a nostalgic sense of the passing of the Old West; a preoccupation with the emotionality of male bonding and of the experiential 'gap' between the young and the old; and the fearful evocation, in the form of the Hammonds (the villains in the film), of these preoccupations transmuted into brutal and perverse forms.<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>[[Joel McCrea|McCrea]], like Scott, retired from filmmaking after this picture, although he returned to the screen twice in later years.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriages===\nScott married twice. In 1936, he became the second husband of heiress [[Marion duPont Scott|Marion duPont]], daughter of William Du Pont Sr., and great-granddaughter of \u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Du Pont de Nemours, the founder of the [[E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]]. Marion had previously married George Somerville, with Scott serving as best man at the wedding. The Scotts' marriage ended in divorce three years later, in 1939. The union produced no children. Though divorced, she kept his last name nearly five decades, until her death in 1983.<ref>Sargent, Sarah.

A summer of singing at Kansas City's [[Electric Park, Kansas City|Electric Park]] amusement park led to Beery leaving for [[New York City]] while just sixteen years old.<ref name=\"Dictionary\"/>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Song of the Flame 1930.JPG|thumb|left|Noah Beery (l.) in 1930]]\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 01.jpg|thumb|left|Noah Beery and [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]] (center drawing)]]\n[[File:Noah Beery Sr & Son - Mar 1922 Silverscreen.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Noah Beery and son [[Noah Beery Jr.]] in 1922]]\n[[File:Noah Beery-Tom Kennedy in Man of the Forest.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Beery and [[Tom Kennedy (actor)|Tom Kennedy]] in ''[[Man of the Forest (1933 film)|Man of the Forest]]'' (1933)]]\nNoah Beery found work in [[vaudeville]] and in the chorus of musical comedies during his early years in New York. Soon though he would turn his attention to acting in melodramas of the period, often under the direction of [[William A. Brady]].<ref name=\"Dictionary\"/>\n\nAfter a dozen years on the stage, he joined his brother Wallace in [[Hollywood]] in 1915 to make motion pictures. He became a respected [[character actor]], adept at playing the villain. One of his most memorable characterizations was as Sergeant Gonzales in ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) opposite [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. The tagline on the poster for ''[[Stormswept]]'' (1923) proclaimed \"Wallace and Noah Beery, The Two Greatest Character Actors on the American Screen\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nBeery acted through the [[silent film]] era, and successfully made the transition to \"[[sound film|talkies]]\". He appeared in lavish early [[Technicolor]] musicals, such as ''[[The Show of Shows]]'' (1929), the [[widescreen]] musical ''[[Song of the Flame]]'' (1930; the movie's poster noted that \"Noah Beery will thrill you with his wonderful bass voice, twice as low as any ever recorded\"), ''[[Bright Lights (1930 film)|Bright Lights]]'' (1930), ''[[Under a Texas Moon (film)|Under a Texas Moon]]'' (1930) and ''[[Golden Dawn (film)|Golden Dawn]]'' (1930; in which he wore [[blackface]] as an [[Africa]]n native).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nHe reached his peak in popularity in 1930, even recording a [[phonograph]] record for [[Brunswick Records]] with songs from two of his films. However, his popularity gradually declined while his brother Wallace became the highest-paid actor in the world, winning an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and arranging a contract with [[MGM]] in which he would be paid $1 more than any other actor on their roster. Noah Beery Sr. played the flamboyant supporting role of [[Mae West]]'s bar-owning lover until she leaves him for [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'' (1933), while his brother Wallace performed in an extremely similar part, as the top-billed lead, later the same year in ''[[The Bowery (1933 film)|The Bowery]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAt the height of his career, Noah Beery began billing himself as \"'''Noah Beery Sr.'''\" in anticipation of his son's presence in films. After his death, his son dropped the \"Junior\" and became simply Noah Beery. Among other films, Noah Beery Sr. and Noah Beery Jr. appeared together in ''[[The Trail Beyond]]'' (1934) with [[John Wayne]]; Beery's son Noah Jr. later became best known as [[James Garner]]'s character's father in the 1970s television series ''[[The Rockford Files]]''. Noah Beery Sr. appeared in nearly 200 films during his career and in 1945 returned to [[New York City]] to star in the [[Mike Todd]] Broadway production of ''[[Up in Central Park]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nNoah Beery Sr. married fellow actor Marguerite Walker Lindsey in 1910. Their first child died in infancy. Their second child, actor [[Noah Beery Jr.|Noah Lindsey Beery (stage name Noah Beery Jr.)]], was born in 1913 and was seriously ill in early childhood, prompting a brief move to [[Florida]] on the advice of doctors.<ref name=\"Western\"/>\n\n==Death==\nBeery died on April 1, 1946 after suffering a [[heart attack]] at the [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] home of his brother [[Wallace Beery]].

He was the older brother of [[Academy Award]]-winning actor [[Wallace Beery]] and the father of character actor [[Noah Beery Jr.]] Beery was billed as either '''Noah Beery''' or '''Noah Beery Sr.''' depending upon the film.\n\n==Early life==\nNoah Nicholas Beery was born on a farm in [[Clay County, Missouri]] not far from [[Smithville, Missouri|Smithville]].<ref name=\"Dictionary\">''Dictionary of Missouri Biography'', Lawrence O.

Soon though he would turn his attention to acting in melodramas of the period, often under the direction of [[William A. Brady]].<ref name=\"Dictionary\"/>\n\nAfter a dozen years on the stage, he joined his brother Wallace in [[Hollywood]] in 1915 to make motion pictures. He became a respected [[character actor]], adept at playing the villain. One of his most memorable characterizations was as Sergeant Gonzales in ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) opposite [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. The tagline on the poster for ''[[Stormswept]]'' (1923) proclaimed \"Wallace and Noah Beery, The Two Greatest Character Actors on the American Screen\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nBeery acted through the [[silent film]] era, and successfully made the transition to \"[[sound film|talkies]]\". He appeared in lavish early [[Technicolor]] musicals, such as ''[[The Show of Shows]]'' (1929), the [[widescreen]] musical ''[[Song of the Flame]]'' (1930; the movie's poster noted that \"Noah Beery will thrill you with his wonderful bass voice, twice as low as any ever recorded\"), ''[[Bright Lights (1930 film)|Bright Lights]]'' (1930), ''[[Under a Texas Moon (film)|Under a Texas Moon]]'' (1930) and ''[[Golden Dawn (film)|Golden Dawn]]'' (1930; in which he wore [[blackface]] as an [[Africa]]n native).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nHe reached his peak in popularity in 1930, even recording a [[phonograph]] record for [[Brunswick Records]] with songs from two of his films.

Among other films, Noah Beery Sr. and Noah Beery Jr. appeared together in ''[[The Trail Beyond]]'' (1934) with [[John Wayne]]; Beery's son Noah Jr. later became best known as [[James Garner]]'s character's father in the 1970s television series ''[[The Rockford Files]]''. Noah Beery Sr. appeared in nearly 200 films during his career and in 1945 returned to [[New York City]] to star in the [[Mike Todd]] Broadway production of ''[[Up in Central Park]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nNoah Beery Sr. married fellow actor Marguerite Walker Lindsey in 1910. Their first child died in infancy. Their second child, actor [[Noah Beery Jr.|Noah Lindsey Beery (stage name Noah Beery Jr.)]], was born in 1913 and was seriously ill in early childhood, prompting a brief move to [[Florida]] on the advice of doctors.<ref name=\"Western\"/>\n\n==Death==\nBeery died on April 1, 1946 after suffering a [[heart attack]] at the [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] home of his brother [[Wallace Beery]]. It was Wallace's birthday and, in addition to celebrating the event, the brothers were rehearsing a radio drama they were scheduled to perform later in the evening.<ref name=\"Dictionary\"/>\n\nHe was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]], Hollywood Hills in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>Wilson, Scott.

The film is divided into three chapters and follows the story of a stick-figure man named Bill, who struggles with his failing memory and [[absurdism|absurdist]] visions, among other symptoms of an unknown neurological illness, implied to be brain cancer. The film employs both offbeat humor and serious philosophical musings. It received critical acclaim and won numerous awards.\n\n== Plot ==\nBill is a young man whose daily routines, perceptions, and dreams are illustrated onscreen through multiple split-screen windows, which are in turn narrated (by [[Don Hertzfeldt]]). The Narrator subtly explains that Bill is suffering from a problematic memory disorder, which interferes with his seemingly mundane life. Bill often has meetings with his unnamed ex-girlfriend, and had been recently referred to a clinic for his condition. On a visit to the clinic, Bill's doctor recommends that Bill have a new batch of medication, after his recent treatment didn't yield any positive results. It is unknown if Bill did take the new medication, as he undergoes a hallucinatory experience the next morning and then stays awake the following night. The next day Bill suffers more hallucinations, seeing monsters and ripping his own head open.\n\nBill is then shown lying down in an alleyway. To recuperate, Bill's mother comes to take care of him, though he attacks her when she comes at him with a pair of scissors. Bill is then taken to hospital, where his health fluctuates, confusing his doctor. Bill's doctor concludes that Bill is not going to die, wherein his mother removes all the flowers from the hospital room and returning a casket meant for him. Bill then goes back to work.\n\nThe film flashes back to Bill's childhood, with the Narrator explaining the death of Bill's half-brother Randall. Randall was in the \"special\" class at school, having aluminium hook arms and \"a brain as misshapen as his legs\". On a school trip at the seaside, Randall chased a gull and disappeared into the sea. After Randall's death, Bill's mother soon became fiercely protective of Bill and rarely left home. The Narrator then explains the details of Bill's stepfather leaving the house for good and Bill's mother rocking on the spot in front of the door afterwards. The Narrator also details the history of Bill's family, with many of them suffering from various diseases, such as [[polio]] and [[yellow fever]]. Many of Bill's family members were apparently killed by trains, and one\u2014his great-great-uncle\u2014was outcast from town and \"died in the field one summer morning while dreaming of the moon.\"\n\nA few days after leaving the hospital, Bill receives a call telling him that his mother had died; she was hit by a train after skipping her medication and launching into a fit of senile hysterics. After the funeral, Bill goes through his mother's old belongings, finding a physician's note strongly recommending that she never have a child. \n\nBill sees his doctor once again, who unexpectedly finds nothing wrong with him. On his way to lunch, Bill suffers a seizure and collapses to the ground. During the seizure, various memories of his infancy and childhood flash before him, including an encounter with someone on a beach. Bill is again taken to hospital, where he is frequently visited by his ex-girlfriend. Bill's new doctor questions him, revealing that Bill cannot remember basic information about his life, such as his address or what month it is. He also cannot remember the name of his ex-girlfriend. Bill has surgery, after which he is asked various questions and shown photographs that appear irregular or nonsensical.\n\nBill's doctor explains to his ex-girlfriend that Bill is having trouble understanding past-tense and present-tense, and it is implied that many of Bill's childhood memories and family history could have been [[confabulated]]. Bill is allowed to go home for family care, but when he arrives home, no one is there to take care of him. Bill starts to repeat and then forget various tasks, such as buying food and taking walks, and does not seem to understand that he is ill. Bill's doctor explains that he doesn't have long to live.\n\nBill's outlook on life starkly changes; he marvels at the night sky and notices details of insignificant objects that amaze him. This change is complemented by a change in the film's animation: full-color photography is merged into the scenery. Bill rents a car and drives into the night, blindly following his instincts without knowing where he will end up. Arriving at a house, the Narrator reveals that it is in fact Bill's childhood home. Bill's uncle, who may have followed him, gives him an address to where Bill can find his real father, who Bill has not seen since childhood.\n\nGoing to a nursing home, Bill finds his father chair bound; neither of them remember who the other is or why they are there. When Bill leaves, he tells his father that he is forgiven, causing Bill's father to cry. The Narrator explains that they will never see each other again. Bill continues driving on, more frenzied now, and stops in a forest. He lies down underneath a tree, and the Narrator states, \"It's such a beautiful day.\" The screen cuts to black.\n\nThe Narrator, breaking character, realizes that Bill may die there and stubbornly refuses to believe that he will. Bill is then shown walking away from the forest. The Narrator explains that Bill has become immortal and travels the world, learning everything there is to know, yet death remains a complete mystery to him.

The film is divided into three chapters and follows the story of a stick-figure man named Bill, who struggles with his failing memory and [[absurdism|absurdist]] visions, among other symptoms of an unknown neurological illness, implied to be brain cancer. The film employs both offbeat humor and serious philosophical musings. It received critical acclaim and won numerous awards.\n\n== Plot ==\nBill is a young man whose daily routines, perceptions, and dreams are illustrated onscreen through multiple split-screen windows, which are in turn narrated (by [[Don Hertzfeldt]]). The Narrator subtly explains that Bill is suffering from a problematic memory disorder, which interferes with his seemingly mundane life. Bill often has meetings with his unnamed ex-girlfriend, and had been recently referred to a clinic for his condition. On a visit to the clinic, Bill's doctor recommends that Bill have a new batch of medication, after his recent treatment didn't yield any positive results. It is unknown if Bill did take the new medication, as he undergoes a hallucinatory experience the next morning and then stays awake the following night. The next day Bill suffers more hallucinations, seeing monsters and ripping his own head open.\n\nBill is then shown lying down in an alleyway. To recuperate, Bill's mother comes to take care of him, though he attacks her when she comes at him with a pair of scissors. Bill is then taken to hospital, where his health fluctuates, confusing his doctor. Bill's doctor concludes that Bill is not going to die, wherein his mother removes all the flowers from the hospital room and returning a casket meant for him. Bill then goes back to work.\n\nThe film flashes back to Bill's childhood, with the Narrator explaining the death of Bill's half-brother Randall. Randall was in the \"special\" class at school, having aluminium hook arms and \"a brain as misshapen as his legs\". On a school trip at the seaside, Randall chased a gull and disappeared into the sea. After Randall's death, Bill's mother soon became fiercely protective of Bill and rarely left home. The Narrator then explains the details of Bill's stepfather leaving the house for good and Bill's mother rocking on the spot in front of the door afterwards. The Narrator also details the history of Bill's family, with many of them suffering from various diseases, such as [[polio]] and [[yellow fever]]. Many of Bill's family members were apparently killed by trains, and one\u2014his great-great-uncle\u2014was outcast from town and \"died in the field one summer morning while dreaming of the moon.\"\n\nA few days after leaving the hospital, Bill receives a call telling him that his mother had died; she was hit by a train after skipping her medication and launching into a fit of senile hysterics. After the funeral, Bill goes through his mother's old belongings, finding a physician's note strongly recommending that she never have a child. \n\nBill sees his doctor once again, who unexpectedly finds nothing wrong with him. On his way to lunch, Bill suffers a seizure and collapses to the ground. During the seizure, various memories of his infancy and childhood flash before him, including an encounter with someone on a beach. Bill is again taken to hospital, where he is frequently visited by his ex-girlfriend. Bill's new doctor questions him, revealing that Bill cannot remember basic information about his life, such as his address or what month it is. He also cannot remember the name of his ex-girlfriend. Bill has surgery, after which he is asked various questions and shown photographs that appear irregular or nonsensical.\n\nBill's doctor explains to his ex-girlfriend that Bill is having trouble understanding past-tense and present-tense, and it is implied that many of Bill's childhood memories and family history could have been [[confabulated]]. Bill is allowed to go home for family care, but when he arrives home, no one is there to take care of him. Bill starts to repeat and then forget various tasks, such as buying food and taking walks, and does not seem to understand that he is ill. Bill's doctor explains that he doesn't have long to live.\n\nBill's outlook on life starkly changes; he marvels at the night sky and notices details of insignificant objects that amaze him. This change is complemented by a change in the film's animation: full-color photography is merged into the scenery. Bill rents a car and drives into the night, blindly following his instincts without knowing where he will end up. Arriving at a house, the Narrator reveals that it is in fact Bill's childhood home. Bill's uncle, who may have followed him, gives him an address to where Bill can find his real father, who Bill has not seen since childhood.\n\nGoing to a nursing home, Bill finds his father chair bound; neither of them remember who the other is or why they are there. When Bill leaves, he tells his father that he is forgiven, causing Bill's father to cry. The Narrator explains that they will never see each other again. Bill continues driving on, more frenzied now, and stops in a forest. He lies down underneath a tree, and the Narrator states, \"It's such a beautiful day.\" The screen cuts to black.\n\nThe Narrator, breaking character, realizes that Bill may die there and stubbornly refuses to believe that he will. Bill is then shown walking away from the forest. The Narrator explains that Bill has become immortal and travels the world, learning everything there is to know, yet death remains a complete mystery to him. Bill outlives the human race, surpassing the next inhabitants of the Earth who revere him as a god. He continues living until the Earth is destroyed by the Sun, continuing even when that has gone as well. Floating in space, Bill observes the stars going out, until the screen cuts to black.\n\n==Release==\nIt had a limited theatrical run<ref name=\"slate\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/12/10/don_hertzfeldt_s_it_s_such_a_beautiful_day_the_best_animated_movie_of_the.html|title=The Best Animated Film of the Year|last1=Wickman|first1=Forrest|date=December 10, 2012|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|url-status=live|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref> before becoming available on [[DVD]],<ref name=\"slate\" /> [[Vimeo]],<ref name=\"wp\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/going-out-guide/wp/2014/11/14/watch-online-the-girl-amor-cronico-and-its-such-a-beautiful-day/|title=Watch online: \u2018The Girl,\u2019 \u2018Amor Cronico\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s Such a Beautiful Day\u2019|last1=Hornaday|first1=Ann|date=November 14, 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=August 19, 2015|url-status=live|last2=O'Sullivan|first2=Michael|last3=Merry|first3=Stephanie}}</ref> [[iTunes]],<ref name=\"wp\" /> and [[Netflix]].\n\nThe three chapters of the film were originally produced and released independently as animated short films, captured entirely on 35mm film with in-camera special effects.\n\nThe first installment, ''[[Everything Will Be OK]]'', was released in 2006 and won the 2007 [[Sundance Film Festival]] Grand Prize for Short Film.

Geography accordingly bounds its neighborhoods. These ridges consist of upper Stonehenge limestone. Many of the older buildings were built from this stone, which is easily quarried and dressed onsite. It whitens in weathering and the [[Conglomerate (geology)#Clast composition|edgewise conglomerate]] and wavy laminae become distinctly visible, giving a handsome and uniquely \u201c[[Cumberland Valley]]\u201d appearance. Several of Hagerstown's churches are constructed of Stonehenge limestone and its value and beauty as building rock may be seen particularly in [[Saint John's Church (Hagerstown, Maryland)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] on West Antietam Street and the Presbyterian Church at the corner of Washington and Prospect Streets. Brick and concrete eventually displaced this native stone in the construction process.<ref>Ray Smith Bass, State of Maryland Geological Survey, Cambrian and Ordovician Deposits of Maryland (1919) at [https://books.google.com/books?id=B3m7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA98&dq=stonehenge+Hagerstown+St.+John's&hl=en&ei=HTKgTeXGNe6z0QHkk837BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=stonehenge%20Hagerstown%20St.%20John's&f=false 99].</ref>\n\nHagerstown anchors the [[Hagerstown Metropolitan Area|Hagerstown-Martinsburg, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which lies just northwest of the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area|Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV Combined Statistical Area]] in the heart of the [[Great Appalachian Valley]].

Hagerstown is also the chief commercial and industrial hub for a greater Tri-State Area that includes much of Western Maryland as well as significant portions of [[South Central Pennsylvania|South Central]] [[Pennsylvania]] and the [[Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia|Eastern Panhandle]] of [[West Virginia]].

In 1762, Hager officially founded the town of Elizabethtown which he named after his wife, Elizabeth Kershner. Fourteen years later, Jonathan Hager became known as the \"Father of Washington County\" after his efforts helped Hagerstown become the county seat of newly created Washington County, which Hager also helped create from neighboring [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]]. The City Council changed the community's name to Hager's-Town in 1813 because the name had gained popular usage, and in the following year, the [[Maryland State Legislature]] officially endorsed the changing of the town's name.<ref name=\"Hag2\" /><ref name=\"Maryland State Archives\">{{cite book|title=Laws Made and Passed by the General Assembly of the State of Maryland, at a Session Begun and Held at the City of Annapolis, on Monday, the Sixth Day of December, Eighteen Hundred and Thirteen, and Ending Monday, the Thirty First Day of January, in the Year of Our Lord, Eighteen Hundred and Fourteen|date=1814|publisher=Printed By Jehu Chandler|location=Annapolis|pages=108\u2013113|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000632/html/am632--108.html|accessdate=19 May 2015|ref=\u201cAn act to alter and change the name of Elizabeth-Town, in Washington county, to Hager's-Town, and to incorporate the same,\u201d Chapter 121, passed Jan. 26, 1814}}</ref>\n\nIn 1794, government forces arrested 150 citizens during a [[riot|draft riot]] which was staged by protesters in response to the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmitsburg.net/archive_list/articles/history/rev_war/whiskey.htm|title=How Whiskey Almost Started a War|website=Emmitsburg.net|accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\nHagerstown's strategic location at the border between the North and the South made the city a primary staging area and supply center for four major campaigns during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. In 1861, General [[Robert Patterson]]'s troops used Hagerstown as a base to attack [[Virginia]] troops in the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. In the [[Maryland Campaign]] of 1862, General [[James Longstreet]]'s command occupied the town while en route to the [[Battle of South Mountain]] and [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]]. In 1863, the city was the site of several military incursions and engagements as Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s army invaded and retreated in the [[Gettysburg Campaign]]. In 1864, Hagerstown was invaded by the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] under Lt. Gen. [[Jubal Early]]. On Wednesday, July 6, Early sent 1,500 cavalry, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[John McCausland]], into Hagerstown. The Confederates levied a ransom of $20,000 and a large amount of clothing,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digital.whilbr.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16715coll9|title=Hagerstown Herald and Torch Light|date=July 20, 1864|publisher=Western Maryland Historical Library|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref> in retribution for [[Union (American Civil War)|U.S.]] destruction of farms, feed and cattle in the [[Shenandoah Valley]].  This is in contrast to neighboring [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]], which McCausland razed on July 30 when the borough failed to supply the requested ransom of $500,000 in U.S. currency, or $100,000 in gold.\n\nFollowing the war, in 1872 Maryland and Virginia cooperated to re-inter Confederate dead from their impromptu graves to cemeteries in Hagerstown, Frederick and [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia]]. Roughly 60% however, remained unidentified. In 1877, 15 years after the [[Battle of Antietam]], also known as the Battle of [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], approximately 2,800 Confederate dead from that battle and also from the battles on South Mountain were re-interred in [[Washington Confederate Cemetery]], within Rose Hill Cemetery in Hagerstown.<ref>[http://www.marylandmemories.org/civil_war.html The Crossroads of the Civil War - Hagerstown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101112954/http://www.marylandmemories.org/civil_war.html |date=2007-11-01 }}, Hagerstown-Washington County Convention & Visitor's Bureau, Civil War, Retrieved 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.whilbr.org/WashingtonConfederateCemetery/index.aspx Washington Confederate Cemetery, Hagerstown, Maryland], Western Maryland Historical Library, Retrieved 2014.</ref>\n\n===Railroads===\nHagerstown's nickname of the \"Hub City\" originated from the large number of railroads (and roads) that served the city. Hagerstown was the center of the [[Western Maryland Railway]] and an important city on the [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]], [[Norfolk and Western Railway|Norfolk and Western]], [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio]], and Hagerstown and Frederick Railroads. Currently, the city is a vital location on [[CSX Transportation|CSX]], [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]], and the [[Winchester and Western Railroad]]s.\n\nHagerstown was formerly served by the [[Hagerstown & Frederick Railway]], an [[interurban]] [[tram|trolley]] system, from 1896 to 1947.\n\n===Little Heiskell===\n[[Image:Little heiskell.png|thumb|right|The weathervane known as \"Little Heiskell\", a symbol of the city of Hagerstown, Maryland.]]\nOne of the most recognizable symbols of Hagerstown is the [[weathervane]] known as \"Little Heiskell\". Named after the German tinsmith Benjamin Heiskell who crafted it in 1769 in the form of a [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian soldier]],<ref name=\"Hag2\" /> it stood atop the Market House first and City Hall second for a combined 166 years. It was moved from the Market House to City Hall in 1824.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, the weathervane gained its characteristic bullet hole from a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sharpshooter, who won a bet after shooting it from a full city block away.\n\nIn 1935, the original was retired to the Museum of the Washington County Historical Society, later to be moved to its present display in the Jonathan Hager House. An exact replica has replaced it atop City Hall.\n\nThe weathervane has been depicted in the city's annual Mummers Day Parade by Charles Harry Rittenhouse, Sr. sporting the necessary accoutrements of a [[Germany|German]] [[mercenary]] soldier.\n\nLittle Heiskell was at one time the mascot of [[North Hagerstown High School]].\n\n===Aviation heritage===\nHagerstown's first aircraft production came in World War I with the [[Maryland Pressed Steel Company]] building the [[Bellanca CD]] biplane in hopes of securing government contracts.\n\nFrom 1931 to 1984, [[Fairchild Aircraft]] was based in Hagerstown and was by far the area's most prominent employer. The importance of the company to the city and the country as a whole earned Hagerstown its former nickname \"Home of the Flying Boxcar\".\n\nFairchild moved to Hagerstown from [[Farmingdale, New York]], in 1931 after Sherman Fairchild purchased a majority stock interest in [[Kreider-Reisner Aircraft Company]] of Hagerstown in 1929. Among Fairchild's products during World War II were [[PT-19]]/[[PT-23]]/[[PT-26]] (Cornell) and [[AT-21]] trainers, [[C-82 Packet|C-82]] \"Packet\" cargo planes and missiles. At its height in World War II, Fairchild employed directly and indirectly up to 80% of Hagerstown's workforce or roughly 10,000 people.\n\nIn the postwar era, Fairchild continued to produce aircraft in Hagerstown such as [[C-123 Provider]], [[Fairchild F-27]] and [[Fairchild Hiller FH-227]], [[FH-1100]], [[C-26 Metroliner]], [[UC-26 Metroliner]], [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II]], and the [[Fairchild T-46]] jet trainer.[[Image:Hgrterminal.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Passenger terminal at [[Hagerstown Regional Airport|Hagerstown Regional Airport-Richard A. Henson Field]].]]\nAll production ceased in Hagerstown in 1984 and the company moved elsewhere. Presently, the company is based in [[San Antonio, Texas]] and after a series of mergers and acquisitions, is known as [[M7 Aerospace]].\n\nThe Hagerstown Aviation Museum shows many of these original aircraft. Among the ones on display are: 1939 F24/UC-61C, 1945 C-82A, 1943 PT-19A, and the 1953 [[C-119]].<ref>[[Fairchild Aircraft]], Retrieved 2007.</ref> The museum is located near Hagerstown Regional Airport in the airport's former terminal.\n\nHagerstown is also the birthplace of [[Salisbury, Maryland]]-based [[Piedmont Airlines]] which started out as Henson Aviation. It was founded by [[Richard A. Henson]] in 1931. Today, [[Hagerstown Regional Airport|Hagerstown Regional Airport-Richard A. Henson Field]] is named as such in honor of the airlines' founder.\n\nToday, only small to medium-sized aviation companies remain in the area, e.g., [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]], a defense electronics engineering and manufacturing contractor.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location and topography===\nHagerstown is located at {{Coord|39|38|34|N|77|43|12|W|type:city}} (39.642771, &minus;77.719954).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is situated south of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] and north of the [[Potomac River]] and between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains in a part of the Great Appalachian Valley known regionally as [[Cumberland Valley]] and locally as [[Hagerstown Valley]].

Geography accordingly bounds its neighborhoods. These ridges consist of upper Stonehenge limestone. Many of the older buildings were built from this stone, which is easily quarried and dressed onsite. It whitens in weathering and the [[Conglomerate (geology)#Clast composition|edgewise conglomerate]] and wavy laminae become distinctly visible, giving a handsome and uniquely \u201c[[Cumberland Valley]]\u201d appearance. Several of Hagerstown's churches are constructed of Stonehenge limestone and its value and beauty as building rock may be seen particularly in [[Saint John's Church (Hagerstown, Maryland)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] on West Antietam Street and the Presbyterian Church at the corner of Washington and Prospect Streets. Brick and concrete eventually displaced this native stone in the construction process.<ref>Ray Smith Bass, State of Maryland Geological Survey, Cambrian and Ordovician Deposits of Maryland (1919) at [https://books.google.com/books?id=B3m7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA98&dq=stonehenge+Hagerstown+St.+John's&hl=en&ei=HTKgTeXGNe6z0QHkk837BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=stonehenge%20Hagerstown%20St.%20John's&f=false 99].</ref>\n\nHagerstown anchors the [[Hagerstown Metropolitan Area|Hagerstown-Martinsburg, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which lies just northwest of the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area|Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV Combined Statistical Area]] in the heart of the [[Great Appalachian Valley]].

In 1762, Hager officially founded the town of Elizabethtown which he named after his wife, Elizabeth Kershner. Fourteen years later, Jonathan Hager became known as the \"Father of Washington County\" after his efforts helped Hagerstown become the county seat of newly created Washington County, which Hager also helped create from neighboring [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]]. The City Council changed the community's name to Hager's-Town in 1813 because the name had gained popular usage, and in the following year, the [[Maryland State Legislature]] officially endorsed the changing of the town's name.<ref name=\"Hag2\" /><ref name=\"Maryland State Archives\">{{cite book|title=Laws Made and Passed by the General Assembly of the State of Maryland, at a Session Begun and Held at the City of Annapolis, on Monday, the Sixth Day of December, Eighteen Hundred and Thirteen, and Ending Monday, the Thirty First Day of January, in the Year of Our Lord, Eighteen Hundred and Fourteen|date=1814|publisher=Printed By Jehu Chandler|location=Annapolis|pages=108\u2013113|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000632/html/am632--108.html|accessdate=19 May 2015|ref=\u201cAn act to alter and change the name of Elizabeth-Town, in Washington county, to Hager's-Town, and to incorporate the same,\u201d Chapter 121, passed Jan. 26, 1814}}</ref>\n\nIn 1794, government forces arrested 150 citizens during a [[riot|draft riot]] which was staged by protesters in response to the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmitsburg.net/archive_list/articles/history/rev_war/whiskey.htm|title=How Whiskey Almost Started a War|website=Emmitsburg.net|accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\nHagerstown's strategic location at the border between the North and the South made the city a primary staging area and supply center for four major campaigns during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. In 1861, General [[Robert Patterson]]'s troops used Hagerstown as a base to attack [[Virginia]] troops in the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. In the [[Maryland Campaign]] of 1862, General [[James Longstreet]]'s command occupied the town while en route to the [[Battle of South Mountain]] and [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]]. In 1863, the city was the site of several military incursions and engagements as Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s army invaded and retreated in the [[Gettysburg Campaign]]. In 1864, Hagerstown was invaded by the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] under Lt. Gen. [[Jubal Early]]. On Wednesday, July 6, Early sent 1,500 cavalry, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[John McCausland]], into Hagerstown. The Confederates levied a ransom of $20,000 and a large amount of clothing,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digital.whilbr.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16715coll9|title=Hagerstown Herald and Torch Light|date=July 20, 1864|publisher=Western Maryland Historical Library|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref> in retribution for [[Union (American Civil War)|U.S.]] destruction of farms, feed and cattle in the [[Shenandoah Valley]].  This is in contrast to neighboring [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]], which McCausland razed on July 30 when the borough failed to supply the requested ransom of $500,000 in U.S. currency, or $100,000 in gold.\n\nFollowing the war, in 1872 Maryland and Virginia cooperated to re-inter Confederate dead from their impromptu graves to cemeteries in Hagerstown, Frederick and [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia]]. Roughly 60% however, remained unidentified. In 1877, 15 years after the [[Battle of Antietam]], also known as the Battle of [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], approximately 2,800 Confederate dead from that battle and also from the battles on South Mountain were re-interred in [[Washington Confederate Cemetery]], within Rose Hill Cemetery in Hagerstown.<ref>[http://www.marylandmemories.org/civil_war.html The Crossroads of the Civil War - Hagerstown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101112954/http://www.marylandmemories.org/civil_war.html |date=2007-11-01 }}, Hagerstown-Washington County Convention & Visitor's Bureau, Civil War, Retrieved 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.whilbr.org/WashingtonConfederateCemetery/index.aspx Washington Confederate Cemetery, Hagerstown, Maryland], Western Maryland Historical Library, Retrieved 2014.</ref>\n\n===Railroads===\nHagerstown's nickname of the \"Hub City\" originated from the large number of railroads (and roads) that served the city.

Currently, the city is a vital location on [[CSX Transportation|CSX]], [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]], and the [[Winchester and Western Railroad]]s.\n\nHagerstown was formerly served by the [[Hagerstown & Frederick Railway]], an [[interurban]] [[tram|trolley]] system, from 1896 to 1947.\n\n===Little Heiskell===\n[[Image:Little heiskell.png|thumb|right|The weathervane known as \"Little Heiskell\", a symbol of the city of Hagerstown, Maryland.]]\nOne of the most recognizable symbols of Hagerstown is the [[weathervane]] known as \"Little Heiskell\". Named after the German tinsmith Benjamin Heiskell who crafted it in 1769 in the form of a [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian soldier]],<ref name=\"Hag2\" /> it stood atop the Market House first and City Hall second for a combined 166 years. It was moved from the Market House to City Hall in 1824.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, the weathervane gained its characteristic bullet hole from a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sharpshooter, who won a bet after shooting it from a full city block away.\n\nIn 1935, the original was retired to the Museum of the Washington County Historical Society, later to be moved to its present display in the Jonathan Hager House. An exact replica has replaced it atop City Hall.\n\nThe weathervane has been depicted in the city's annual Mummers Day Parade by Charles Harry Rittenhouse, Sr. sporting the necessary accoutrements of a [[Germany|German]] [[mercenary]] soldier.\n\nLittle Heiskell was at one time the mascot of [[North Hagerstown High School]].\n\n===Aviation heritage===\nHagerstown's first aircraft production came in World War I with the [[Maryland Pressed Steel Company]] building the [[Bellanca CD]] biplane in hopes of securing government contracts.\n\nFrom 1931 to 1984, [[Fairchild Aircraft]] was based in Hagerstown and was by far the area's most prominent employer. The importance of the company to the city and the country as a whole earned Hagerstown its former nickname \"Home of the Flying Boxcar\".\n\nFairchild moved to Hagerstown from [[Farmingdale, New York]], in 1931 after Sherman Fairchild purchased a majority stock interest in [[Kreider-Reisner Aircraft Company]] of Hagerstown in 1929. Among Fairchild's products during World War II were [[PT-19]]/[[PT-23]]/[[PT-26]] (Cornell) and [[AT-21]] trainers, [[C-82 Packet|C-82]] \"Packet\" cargo planes and missiles. At its height in World War II, Fairchild employed directly and indirectly up to 80% of Hagerstown's workforce or roughly 10,000 people.\n\nIn the postwar era, Fairchild continued to produce aircraft in Hagerstown such as [[C-123 Provider]], [[Fairchild F-27]] and [[Fairchild Hiller FH-227]], [[FH-1100]], [[C-26 Metroliner]], [[UC-26 Metroliner]], [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II]], and the [[Fairchild T-46]] jet trainer.[[Image:Hgrterminal.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Passenger terminal at [[Hagerstown Regional Airport|Hagerstown Regional Airport-Richard A. Henson Field]].]]\nAll production ceased in Hagerstown in 1984 and the company moved elsewhere. Presently, the company is based in [[San Antonio, Texas]] and after a series of mergers and acquisitions, is known as [[M7 Aerospace]].\n\nThe Hagerstown Aviation Museum shows many of these original aircraft. Among the ones on display are: 1939 F24/UC-61C, 1945 C-82A, 1943 PT-19A, and the 1953 [[C-119]].<ref>[[Fairchild Aircraft]], Retrieved 2007.</ref> The museum is located near Hagerstown Regional Airport in the airport's former terminal.\n\nHagerstown is also the birthplace of [[Salisbury, Maryland]]-based [[Piedmont Airlines]] which started out as Henson Aviation. It was founded by [[Richard A. Henson]] in 1931. Today, [[Hagerstown Regional Airport|Hagerstown Regional Airport-Richard A. Henson Field]] is named as such in honor of the airlines' founder.\n\nToday, only small to medium-sized aviation companies remain in the area, e.g., [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]], a defense electronics engineering and manufacturing contractor.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location and topography===\nHagerstown is located at {{Coord|39|38|34|N|77|43|12|W|type:city}} (39.642771, &minus;77.719954).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is situated south of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] and north of the [[Potomac River]] and between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains in a part of the Great Appalachian Valley known regionally as [[Cumberland Valley]] and locally as [[Hagerstown Valley]].

This involves serving one year with a Marine Corps unit (two years for reserves), passing the Marine Physical Fitness Test (PFT), a written test, demonstrating skills used in service with the Marines such as weapon breakdown and familiarization, land navigation, combat communications and an oral examination by senior enlisted sailors who are FMF qualified.

As of 2004, all U.S. Navy corpsmen assigned to a Marine unit are required to earn the FMF badge within 18 months of their being assigned to said unit.\n\n===Enlisted requirements===\nWhen qualifying for the Enlisted Fleet Marine Force Warfare specialist pin, a hospital corpsman, religious programs specialist, personnel specialist, along with some construction battalion \"SeaBee\" units (when directly assigned to a U.S. Marine Corps combatant command) are required to have detailed knowledge on the following subjects:\n\n''CORE''\n*Safety Fundamentals (Operational Risk Management)\n*Marine Corps History, Rank Structure, and Courtesies (notable dates, personnel, battles, and Naval courtesies as they pertain to the USMC)\n*Marine Corps Mission and Organization \n*Administrative Fundamentals (Naval correspondence, courts martial, and service record information)\n*General Combat Leadership Fundamentals (Combat elements, POW rights and responsibilities, Military Code of Conduct)\n*First Aid and Field Sanitation Fundamentals (Triage, MEDEVAC & CASEVAC classifications, \"Self\" and \"Buddy\" aid skill sets for non-medical personnel)\n*Security Fundamentals (Security classifications, terrorism, lethal force, and guard skills training)\n*Field Communication Fundamentals (hands on detailed knowledge of the PRC-119 SINGARS radio, loading frequencies and communication of the 9-Line CASEVAC message)\n*Weapons Fundamentals (Detailed knowledge of small arms such as the M9, M16A4, M4, M1014, M67 grenade, M203, and M249SAW) and machine gun platforms (M240G, M2 .50 cal, Mk19)\n*Tactical Fundamental Procedures (platoon hand and arm signals, SALUTE and SMEAC reports, fighting positions, MOPP gear, formation movements in day/night conditions)\n*Marine Corps Operations Fundamentals (In-depth knowledge of all USMC aircraft, US Navy amphibious transports, hospital ships, as well as Urban warfare examples, and Military Operations Other Than War examples)\n*Chemical, Biological Radiological and Nuclear Defense Fundamentals (minefield signage and detailed signs, symptoms, & treatment of chemical agent exposures)\n*Drill and Ceremonies Fundamentals (breakdowns of formations, drill & cadence, color guards, and formal ceremonies)\n*Land Navigation Fundamentals (Map reading and compass handling)<ref name=\"auto\">NAVEDTRA 43908-B Aug2010</ref>\n\nAdditionally a second section of the course is detailed toward the element of the United States Marine Corps with which the candidate is assigned.  For example: a line corpsman with an infantry battalion will learn the Ground Combat Element (GCE).\n\n''GCE''\n*Infantry Fundamentals (Mission & structure of the Marine Division, Regiment, Battalion, Infantry & Weapons Companies, Platoon, Squad, and Fire teams)\n*Marine Artillery Regiment (Mission, structure, equipment of the Arty battalion; such as the m198 or m777 Howitzer)\n*Tank Battalion Fundamentals (Mission, structure, and equipment of the Tank Battalion; such as the M1A1, TOW Missile, M88A1E1 Hercules, and M60A1 Bridge Vehicle)\n*Assault Amphibious Battalion Fundamentals (Mission, structure, and vehicles of the AAB; such as the AAVP7A1, AAVC7A1 and AAVR7A1)\n*Combat Engineer Battalion Fundamentals (Mission, structure, mobility/counter mobility/survivability tasks of the CEB, Engineer Support Company, and Combat Engineer Company)\n*Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion (Mission, structure, and vehicles of the LAV Battalion; such as the LAV-25, LAV-M, LAV-AT, LAV-C2, LAV-R, and LAV-L)\n*Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion Fundamentals (Mission, tasks, and training of Force Recon and Division Recon)\n<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nFurthermore, to finally qualify, a candidate is expected to perform a disassembly and reassembly of many of the taught weapon systems, operate a SINGARS radio, and plot various points on a map, perform various carries and life saving medical techniques, and in many cases perform (and pass) a Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test(PFT) and Combat Fitness Test (CFT)\n\nAlthough this is a qualification is for enlisted personnel serving in the United States Navy, it is unique in that only Commanding Generals or Commanding Officers of qualifying U.S. Marine Corps commands, Division, Group, or Wing; can approve awarding of the designation. As such, to some corpsmen it is the most coveted warfare insignia within the hospital corpsman community.\n\nThe eagle, globe, and anchor (EGA) makes a clear statement that the wearer is a member of the Navy/Marine Corps team. The crossed rifles symbolize the rifleman ethic of the Marine Corps; every Marine is a rifleman, just as every Sailor is a firefighter and damage controlman aboard ship and submarine.

Fonseca, Jr., USN.jpg|thumb|upright|A corpsman in June 2012 wearing the FMFEWS on the NSU.]]\nThe '''Fleet Marine Force Enlisted Warfare Specialist Device''' ('''FMFEWS''') is a qualification insignia of the [[United States Navy]] earned by enlisted U.S. Navy sailors assigned to the [[Fleet Marine Force]] of the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] who have successfully completed the requirements of the Enlisted Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist (EFMFWS) Program per OPNAV Instruction 1414.4B. This involves serving one year with a Marine Corps unit (two years for reserves), passing the Marine Physical Fitness Test (PFT), a written test, demonstrating skills used in service with the Marines such as weapon breakdown and familiarization, land navigation, combat communications and an oral examination by senior enlisted sailors who are FMF qualified. The Enlisted Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist designation is most commonly awarded to the [[hospital corpsman]] (HM) and [[religious program specialist]] (RP) ratings, although it is also awarded to other sailors who support Marine Corps commands (e.g. Logistics Specialists assigned to medical logistics companies).\n\nAn enlisted U.S. Navy sailor who has qualified, may place the designator (FMF) after his or her rate and/or rate; for example, HM3 John Doe, USN, having qualified for his FMF pin, is identified as HM3 (FMF) John Doe, USN. As of 2004, all U.S. Navy corpsmen assigned to a Marine unit are required to earn the FMF badge within 18 months of their being assigned to said unit.\n\n===Enlisted requirements===\nWhen qualifying for the Enlisted Fleet Marine Force Warfare specialist pin, a hospital corpsman, religious programs specialist, personnel specialist, along with some construction battalion \"SeaBee\" units (when directly assigned to a U.S. Marine Corps combatant command) are required to have detailed knowledge on the following subjects:\n\n''CORE''\n*Safety Fundamentals (Operational Risk Management)\n*Marine Corps History, Rank Structure, and Courtesies (notable dates, personnel, battles, and Naval courtesies as they pertain to the USMC)\n*Marine Corps Mission and Organization \n*Administrative Fundamentals (Naval correspondence, courts martial, and service record information)\n*General Combat Leadership Fundamentals (Combat elements, POW rights and responsibilities, Military Code of Conduct)\n*First Aid and Field Sanitation Fundamentals (Triage, MEDEVAC & CASEVAC classifications, \"Self\" and \"Buddy\" aid skill sets for non-medical personnel)\n*Security Fundamentals (Security classifications, terrorism, lethal force, and guard skills training)\n*Field Communication Fundamentals (hands on detailed knowledge of the PRC-119 SINGARS radio, loading frequencies and communication of the 9-Line CASEVAC message)\n*Weapons Fundamentals (Detailed knowledge of small arms such as the M9, M16A4, M4, M1014, M67 grenade, M203, and M249SAW) and machine gun platforms (M240G, M2 .50 cal, Mk19)\n*Tactical Fundamental Procedures (platoon hand and arm signals, SALUTE and SMEAC reports, fighting positions, MOPP gear, formation movements in day/night conditions)\n*Marine Corps Operations Fundamentals (In-depth knowledge of all USMC aircraft, US Navy amphibious transports, hospital ships, as well as Urban warfare examples, and Military Operations Other Than War examples)\n*Chemical, Biological Radiological and Nuclear Defense Fundamentals (minefield signage and detailed signs, symptoms, & treatment of chemical agent exposures)\n*Drill and Ceremonies Fundamentals (breakdowns of formations, drill & cadence, color guards, and formal ceremonies)\n*Land Navigation Fundamentals (Map reading and compass handling)<ref name=\"auto\">NAVEDTRA 43908-B Aug2010</ref>\n\nAdditionally a second section of the course is detailed toward the element of the United States Marine Corps with which the candidate is assigned.  For example: a line corpsman with an infantry battalion will learn the Ground Combat Element (GCE).\n\n''GCE''\n*Infantry Fundamentals (Mission & structure of the Marine Division, Regiment, Battalion, Infantry & Weapons Companies, Platoon, Squad, and Fire teams)\n*Marine Artillery Regiment (Mission, structure, equipment of the Arty battalion; such as the m198 or m777 Howitzer)\n*Tank Battalion Fundamentals (Mission, structure, and equipment of the Tank Battalion; such as the M1A1, TOW Missile, M88A1E1 Hercules, and M60A1 Bridge Vehicle)\n*Assault Amphibious Battalion Fundamentals (Mission, structure, and vehicles of the AAB; such as the AAVP7A1, AAVC7A1 and AAVR7A1)\n*Combat Engineer Battalion Fundamentals (Mission, structure, mobility/counter mobility/survivability tasks of the CEB, Engineer Support Company, and Combat Engineer Company)\n*Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion (Mission, structure, and vehicles of the LAV Battalion; such as the LAV-25, LAV-M, LAV-AT, LAV-C2, LAV-R, and LAV-L)\n*Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion Fundamentals (Mission, tasks, and training of Force Recon and Division Recon)\n<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nFurthermore, to finally qualify, a candidate is expected to perform a disassembly and reassembly of many of the taught weapon systems, operate a SINGARS radio, and plot various points on a map, perform various carries and life saving medical techniques, and in many cases perform (and pass) a Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test(PFT) and Combat Fitness Test (CFT)\n\nAlthough this is a qualification is for enlisted personnel serving in the United States Navy, it is unique in that only Commanding Generals or Commanding Officers of qualifying U.S. Marine Corps commands, Division, Group, or Wing; can approve awarding of the designation. As such, to some corpsmen it is the most coveted warfare insignia within the hospital corpsman community.\n\nThe eagle, globe, and anchor (EGA) makes a clear statement that the wearer is a member of the Navy/Marine Corps team. The crossed rifles symbolize the rifleman ethic of the Marine Corps; every Marine is a rifleman, just as every Sailor is a firefighter and damage controlman aboard ship and submarine. The surf and sand represent the \"littoral zone,\" the coastal regions where sailors have served alongside Marines as they earned their reputation and world's respect -- \"the shores of Tripoli\" and the \"sands of Iwo Jima.\" And has a scroll at the bottom stating \"Fleet Marine Force\" showing the exclusive community they belong to.\n\n==Officer==\n[[File:USN - Fleet Marine Force Officer Insignia.png|250px|right|A highly polished gold and silver metal device depicting the eagle, globe and anchor atop two crossed rifles on a background of ocean swells breaking on a sandy beach and a scroll with the words \"FLEET MARINE FORCE\".]]\n\nThe '''Fleet Marine Force Warfare Officer (FMFWO) Insignia''' is earned by Navy officers assigned to the [[Fleet Marine Force]] of the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] who have completed the requirements including serving for one year in a Marine Corps command, completing a written test, passing the Marine PFT, and an oral board conducted by FMF qualified officers.  The FMF Qualified Officer Insignia is most commonly earned by [[staff officers]] in the medical fields, and chaplains, although it is also awarded to other officer communities, such as [[Civil Engineer Corps]] and [[Naval Gunfire Liaison Officer|naval gunfire officers]].\n\nThe FMFWO insignia is a gold, highly polished, metal device depicting the eagle, globe and anchor (EGA) atop two crossed rifles on a background of ocean swells breaking on a sandy beach atop a scroll with the words \"Fleet Marine Force.\"\n\nThe EGA makes a clear statement that the wearer is a member of the Navy/Marine Corps team.

The album hit the Top 5 in both Australia and the UK, certified [[Music recording sales certification|double platinum]] in Australia and [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in the UK and in Canada.

The album marked somewhat of a return to 1960s-influenced music for Carlisle and included songs mainly written and produced by [[Rick Nowels]] but also two songs co-written by Carlisle. The single \"[[Do You Feel Like I Feel?]]\" was accompanied by a video inspired by the [[B movie]] ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]''. The title track, \"[[Live Your Life Be Free]]\", released as first single outside the United States, was a Top 20 hit single in many countries reaching No.&nbsp;12 in the UK<ref name=fullchart/> and No.&nbsp;13 in Australia. Subsequent releases \"[[Half the World (Belinda Carlisle song)|Half the World]]\" and \"[[Little Black Book (song)|Little Black Book]]\" (co-written by  [[Marcella Detroit]] under her real name Marcy Levy) were also hits outside the United States. The album was also a success in Europe (Top 10 in the UK and Gold certification). To date, \"Do You Feel Like I Feel?\" is Carlisle's final single to enter in the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at No.&nbsp;73.\n\nStill active in Europe and Australia with a record contract at Virgin Records, her 1992 greatest hits album ''[[The Best of Belinda, Volume 1]]'' reached No.&nbsp;1,<ref name=fullchart/> and was certified double platinum in the UK and platinum in Australia. This first greatest hits album included all the hits taken from ''Heaven on Earth'', ''Runaway Horses'', and ''Live Your Life Be Free''. The United States version of the album was named ''Her Greatest Hits'' and also included songs from the first album ''Belinda''.\n\nCarlisle's fifth solo album, ''[[Real (Belinda Carlisle album)|Real]]'', was released in 1993 on the Virgin label in the United States and in Europe. Produced without Nowels, the disc was a departure from Carlisle's polished pop music formula. Even the album's [[cover art|cover]] photograph featured her with little or no make-up. Carlisle co-produced and co-wrote much of the album, collaborating heavily with friend and ex-Go-Go [[Charlotte Caffey]]. The album was Carlisle's fifth consecutive to reach the UK Top 10 peaking at number 9.<ref name=fullchart/> It peaked also at number 23 in Sweden. Its first single, \"[[Big Scary Animal]]\", peaked at No.&nbsp;12 in the UK.<ref name=fullchart/> The second single from ''Real'' was \"[[Lay Down Your Arms (The Graces song)|Lay Down Your Arms]]\", which made the Top 30 in the UK.<ref name=fullchart/> [[Gregg Alexander]] of the [[New Radicals]] co-wrote the single \"Here Comes My Baby\".  Also in 1993, Carlisle provided guest vocals on [[The Lemonheads]] album ''[[Come on Feel the Lemonheads]]''.\n\nThe Go-Go's reunited in 1994 to support the retrospective double-CD ''[[Return to the Valley of The Go-Go's]]'', their second collection, which featured three new songs, including the single \"[[The Whole World Lost Its Head]]\". However, the band broke up again, soon after the promotional [[Concert#Concert tour|tour]].\n\nCarlisle returned to the recording studio, and resumed working again with [[Rick Nowels]]. In 1996 she released in the UK and Australia her sixth solo album, ''[[A Woman and a Man]]'', on the [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]] label. This album, consisting of mostly relaxed [[Adult contemporary music|adult pop]], revitalized her solo career in Europe, and included several hits. The leadoff single, \"[[In Too Deep (Jenny Morris song)|In Too Deep]]\", returned Carlisle to the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 10]] for the first time in six years, reaching No.&nbsp;6. \"[[Always Breaking My Heart]]\", written and produced by [[Roxette]]'s [[Per Gessle]], also made the UK Top 10, peaking at No.&nbsp;8.<ref name=fullchart/>\n\nThe album spawned two further hits in the UK: \"[[Love in the Key of C]]\", and \"[[California (Belinda Carlisle song)|California]]\", which featured arrangement and back-up vocals by [[Brian Wilson]].{{sfn|Carlisle|2011|p=191}} The album reached No.&nbsp;12 in the UK,<ref name=fullchart/> and was certified gold. As a result of ''A Woman and a Man''{{'}}s UK success, the album was released in the United States during the summer of 1997 on the small [[Ark 21 Records|Ark21]] label. In 1997, she recorded \"[[I Won't Say (I'm in Love)]]\" for the Disney movie ''[[Hercules (1997 film)#Music|Hercules]]''. The song was released as a single exclusively in France and Germany.\n\nIn 1999, Carlisle released a greatest hits album in the UK, a double-disc on the Virgin label, collectively titled ''[[A Place on Earth: The Greatest Hits]]''. The first disc featured Carlisle's hits plus three new tracks recorded for the album: the single \"[[All God's Children (song)|All God's Children]]\", and the songs \"A Prayer for Everyone\" and \"Feels Like I've Known You Forever\". The second disc, subtitled ''A Place on Earth'', contained previously released [[remix]]es of some of her hits and some [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s which had not previously been released on CD. Some of the remixes were by [[William Orbit]]. ''[[A Place on Earth: The Greatest Hits]]'' was certified Gold in the UK and went on to sell in excess of one million copies worldwide. A European version was marketed with an interview CD in which Carlisle provides answers to over 40 questions sent in by fans.\n\n===Later recordings and Go-Go's reunions===\n====2001\u20132009====\n[[File:The Go-Gos - Belinda Carlisle, Kathy Valentine and Gina Schock.jpg|thumb|right|Carlisle live with the Go-Go's, Austin, Texas, 2008]]\nIn 2001, the Go-Go's reunited again and released an album of new material, ''[[God Bless The Go-Go's]]''. [[Green Day]]'s lead singer [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] co-wrote the only released single \"[[Unforgiven (The Go-Go's song)|Unforgiven]]\".\n\n''God Bless The Go-Go's'' received mixed reviews from critics. Peter Fawthrop of ''AllMusic'' wrote \"Every bit as Go-Go's, that is, as their non-hits and less remarkable material. While the Go-Go's sound is intact, there is not a \"We Got the Beat\" or a \"Head Over Heels\" to be found. It is feasible that in this age of pop rebirth, the Go-Go's decided it was now or never ... The album doesn't attempt to update the band's sound with hip-hop moves or electronic frippery, for which God should bless 'em, indeed. The girls' hold on the current pop world remains so strong that Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong co-writes a song (\"Unforgiven\") in impeccable Go-Go's drag\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/god-bless-the-go-gos-mw0000001425|title=God Bless The Go-Go's|author=Fawthrop, Peter|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn spite of the mixed reviews, the album charted in the US Billboard 200, peaking at number No.&nbsp;57.

The album marked somewhat of a return to 1960s-influenced music for Carlisle and included songs mainly written and produced by [[Rick Nowels]] but also two songs co-written by Carlisle. The single \"[[Do You Feel Like I Feel?]]\" was accompanied by a video inspired by the [[B movie]] ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]''. The title track, \"[[Live Your Life Be Free]]\", released as first single outside the United States, was a Top 20 hit single in many countries reaching No.&nbsp;12 in the UK<ref name=fullchart/> and No.&nbsp;13 in Australia. Subsequent releases \"[[Half the World (Belinda Carlisle song)|Half the World]]\" and \"[[Little Black Book (song)|Little Black Book]]\" (co-written by  [[Marcella Detroit]] under her real name Marcy Levy) were also hits outside the United States. The album was also a success in Europe (Top 10 in the UK and Gold certification). To date, \"Do You Feel Like I Feel?\" is Carlisle's final single to enter in the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at No.&nbsp;73.\n\nStill active in Europe and Australia with a record contract at Virgin Records, her 1992 greatest hits album ''[[The Best of Belinda, Volume 1]]'' reached No.&nbsp;1,<ref name=fullchart/> and was certified double platinum in the UK and platinum in Australia. This first greatest hits album included all the hits taken from ''Heaven on Earth'', ''Runaway Horses'', and ''Live Your Life Be Free''. The United States version of the album was named ''Her Greatest Hits'' and also included songs from the first album ''Belinda''.\n\nCarlisle's fifth solo album, ''[[Real (Belinda Carlisle album)|Real]]'', was released in 1993 on the Virgin label in the United States and in Europe. Produced without Nowels, the disc was a departure from Carlisle's polished pop music formula. Even the album's [[cover art|cover]] photograph featured her with little or no make-up. Carlisle co-produced and co-wrote much of the album, collaborating heavily with friend and ex-Go-Go [[Charlotte Caffey]]. The album was Carlisle's fifth consecutive to reach the UK Top 10 peaking at number 9.<ref name=fullchart/> It peaked also at number 23 in Sweden. Its first single, \"[[Big Scary Animal]]\", peaked at No.&nbsp;12 in the UK.<ref name=fullchart/> The second single from ''Real'' was \"[[Lay Down Your Arms (The Graces song)|Lay Down Your Arms]]\", which made the Top 30 in the UK.<ref name=fullchart/> [[Gregg Alexander]] of the [[New Radicals]] co-wrote the single \"Here Comes My Baby\".  Also in 1993, Carlisle provided guest vocals on [[The Lemonheads]] album ''[[Come on Feel the Lemonheads]]''.\n\nThe Go-Go's reunited in 1994 to support the retrospective double-CD ''[[Return to the Valley of The Go-Go's]]'', their second collection, which featured three new songs, including the single \"[[The Whole World Lost Its Head]]\". However, the band broke up again, soon after the promotional [[Concert#Concert tour|tour]].\n\nCarlisle returned to the recording studio, and resumed working again with [[Rick Nowels]]. In 1996 she released in the UK and Australia her sixth solo album, ''[[A Woman and a Man]]'', on the [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]] label. This album, consisting of mostly relaxed [[Adult contemporary music|adult pop]], revitalized her solo career in Europe, and included several hits. The leadoff single, \"[[In Too Deep (Jenny Morris song)|In Too Deep]]\", returned Carlisle to the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 10]] for the first time in six years, reaching No.&nbsp;6. \"[[Always Breaking My Heart]]\", written and produced by [[Roxette]]'s [[Per Gessle]], also made the UK Top 10, peaking at No.&nbsp;8.<ref name=fullchart/>\n\nThe album spawned two further hits in the UK: \"[[Love in the Key of C]]\", and \"[[California (Belinda Carlisle song)|California]]\", which featured arrangement and back-up vocals by [[Brian Wilson]].{{sfn|Carlisle|2011|p=191}} The album reached No.&nbsp;12 in the UK,<ref name=fullchart/> and was certified gold. As a result of ''A Woman and a Man''{{'}}s UK success, the album was released in the United States during the summer of 1997 on the small [[Ark 21 Records|Ark21]] label. In 1997, she recorded \"[[I Won't Say (I'm in Love)]]\" for the Disney movie ''[[Hercules (1997 film)#Music|Hercules]]''. The song was released as a single exclusively in France and Germany.\n\nIn 1999, Carlisle released a greatest hits album in the UK, a double-disc on the Virgin label, collectively titled ''[[A Place on Earth: The Greatest Hits]]''. The first disc featured Carlisle's hits plus three new tracks recorded for the album: the single \"[[All God's Children (song)|All God's Children]]\", and the songs \"A Prayer for Everyone\" and \"Feels Like I've Known You Forever\". The second disc, subtitled ''A Place on Earth'', contained previously released [[remix]]es of some of her hits and some [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s which had not previously been released on CD. Some of the remixes were by [[William Orbit]]. ''[[A Place on Earth: The Greatest Hits]]'' was certified Gold in the UK and went on to sell in excess of one million copies worldwide. A European version was marketed with an interview CD in which Carlisle provides answers to over 40 questions sent in by fans.\n\n===Later recordings and Go-Go's reunions===\n====2001\u20132009====\n[[File:The Go-Gos - Belinda Carlisle, Kathy Valentine and Gina Schock.jpg|thumb|right|Carlisle live with the Go-Go's, Austin, Texas, 2008]]\nIn 2001, the Go-Go's reunited again and released an album of new material, ''[[God Bless The Go-Go's]]''. [[Green Day]]'s lead singer [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] co-wrote the only released single \"[[Unforgiven (The Go-Go's song)|Unforgiven]]\".\n\n''God Bless The Go-Go's'' received mixed reviews from critics. Peter Fawthrop of ''AllMusic'' wrote \"Every bit as Go-Go's, that is, as their non-hits and less remarkable material. While the Go-Go's sound is intact, there is not a \"We Got the Beat\" or a \"Head Over Heels\" to be found. It is feasible that in this age of pop rebirth, the Go-Go's decided it was now or never ... The album doesn't attempt to update the band's sound with hip-hop moves or electronic frippery, for which God should bless 'em, indeed.

This law gives the President of the United States the authority to, by [[presidential proclamation]], create [[National monument (United States)|national monuments]] from [[public land| federal land]]s to protect significant natural, cultural, or scientific features. The Act has been used more than a hundred times since its passage.\n\n==History==\nThe Antiquities Act was signed into law by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] during his second term in office. The act resulted from concerns about protecting mostly prehistoric Native American ruins and artifacts -- collectively termed \"[[antiquities]]\" -- on federal lands in the West, such as at [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco Canyon, New Mexico]]. Removal of artifacts from these lands by private collectors, \"pot hunters,\" had become a serious problem by the end of the 19th century. In 1902, [[Iowa]] Congressman [[John F. Lacey]], who chaired the House Committee on the Public Lands, traveled to the Southwest with the rising [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Edgar Lee Hewett]], to see for himself the extent of the pot hunters' impact.  His findings, supported by an exhaustive report by Hewett to Congress detailing the archaeological resources of the region, provided the necessary impetus for the passage of the legislation.<ref>{{cite AV media | title=The National Parks: America's Best Idea | publisher=Florentine Films | people=Ken Burns}}</ref>\n\nSince the Antiquities Act became law, all but four presidents, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W.
