They are characterised by a long [[beak]] and a large [[throat pouch]] used for catching [[prey]] and draining water from the scooped-up contents before swallowing. They have predominantly pale plumage, the exceptions being the [[Brown pelican|brown]] and [[Peruvian pelican]]s. The bills, pouches, and bare facial skin of all species become brightly coloured before the breeding season. The eight living pelican species have a patchy global distribution, ranging [[latitude|latitudinally]] from the [[tropics]] to the [[temperate zone]], though they are absent from interior South America and from [[polar region]]s and the open ocean.\n\nLong thought to be related to [[frigatebird]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[tropicbird]]s, and [[Sulidae|gannets and boobies]], pelicans instead are now known to be most closely related to the [[shoebill]] and [[hamerkop]], and are placed in the order [[Pelecaniformes]]. [[Ibis]]es, [[spoonbill]]s, [[heron]]s, and [[bittern]]s have been classified in the same order. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from [[Oligocene]] strata in France. They are thought to have evolved in the [[Old World]] and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and [[New World]] lineages.\n\nPelicans frequent inland and coastal waters, where they feed principally on fish, catching them at or near the water surface. They are [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] birds, travelling in flocks, [[Cooperative hunting|hunting cooperatively]], and breeding [[bird colony|colonially]]. Four white-plumaged species tend to nest on the ground, and four brown or grey-plumaged species nest mainly in trees. The relationship between pelicans and people has often been contentious. The birds have been persecuted because of their perceived competition with commercial and recreational fishing. Their populations have fallen through [[habitat destruction]], disturbance, and environmental pollution, and three species are of conservation concern. They also have a long history of cultural significance in [[mythology]], and in Christian and [[heraldry|heraldic]] [[iconography]].\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\n\n===Etymology===\nThe genus ''Pelecanus'' was first formally described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''Systema Naturae'''. He described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip, linear nostrils, a bare face, and fully webbed feet. This early definition included frigatebirds, cormorants, and [[Sulidae|sulids]], as well as pelicans.<ref name=\"linnaeus\">{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C. | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis.

The Dalmatian, pink-backed, and spot-billed were all closely related to one another, while the Australian white pelican was their next-closest relative. The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage, but was the first to diverge from the common ancestor of the other four species. This finding suggests that pelicans evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas, and that preference for tree- or ground-nesting is more related to size than genetics.<ref name=kennedy>{{cite journal|author1=Kennedy, Martyn |author2=Taylor, Scott A. |author3=N\u00e1dvorn\u00edk, Petr |author4=Spencer, Hamish G. |date=2013|title=The phylogenetic relationships of the extant pelicans inferred from DNA sequence data|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=66|issue=1|pages=215\u201322|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2012.09.034|pmid=23059726 |url=https://www.colorado.edu/lab/taylor/sites/default/files/attached-files/kennedy_et_al._2012.pdf}}</ref><!-- cites para -->\n\n{| style=\"width:98%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#d3d3a4;\" colspan=\"4\"|Living species of ''Pelecanus''\n|-\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|Common and binomial names<ref name=\"zoonomen\">{{cite web | url =http://www.zoonomen.net/avtax/pele.html |title = Zoological Nomenclature Resource: Pelecaniformes (Version 2.003) |date =14 December 2011|publisher = zoonomen.net |accessdate=21 May 2012 }}</ref>\n!

They can finish the process in a day. The tree-nesting species have a simpler process in which perched males advertise for females.<ref name=NSS/> The location of the breeding colony is constrained by the availability of an ample supply of fish to eat, although pelicans can use thermals to soar and commute for hundreds of kilometres daily to fetch food.<ref name=enc/>\n\nThe Australian pelican has two reproductive strategies depending on the local degree of environmental predictability. Colonies of tens or hundreds, rarely thousands, of birds breed regularly on small coastal and subcoastal islands where food is seasonally or permanently available.

The device of \"a pelican in her piety\" or \"a pelican vulning (from Latin ''vulno'', \"to wound\") herself\" was used in [[heraldry]]. An older version of the myth is that the pelican used to kill its young then resurrect them with its blood, again analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus. Likewise, a folktale from India says that a pelican killed her young by rough treatment, but was then so contrite that she resurrected them with her own blood.<ref name=NSS/>\n\nThe legends of self-wounding and the provision of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill. In reality, it often presses this onto its chest to fully empty the pouch. Another possible derivation is the tendency of the bird to rest with its bill on its breast; the Dalmatian pelican has a blood-red pouch in the early breeding season and this may have contributed to the myth.<ref name=NSS/>\n\n====Heraldry====\n[[File:Coa Hungary Family Kiszely - Benedekfalva.svg|thumb|The arms of the Kiszely family of [[Benedekfalva]] depict a \"pelican in her piety\" both in the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] and [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]].]]\nPelicans have featured extensively in heraldry, generally using the Christian symbolism of the pelican as a caring and self-sacrificing parent.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Saunders|first1=Rev.

They are characterised by a long [[beak]] and a large [[throat pouch]] used for catching [[prey]] and draining water from the scooped-up contents before swallowing. They have predominantly pale plumage, the exceptions being the [[Brown pelican|brown]] and [[Peruvian pelican]]s. The bills, pouches, and bare facial skin of all species become brightly coloured before the breeding season. The eight living pelican species have a patchy global distribution, ranging [[latitude|latitudinally]] from the [[tropics]] to the [[temperate zone]], though they are absent from interior South America and from [[polar region]]s and the open ocean.\n\nLong thought to be related to [[frigatebird]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[tropicbird]]s, and [[Sulidae|gannets and boobies]], pelicans instead are now known to be most closely related to the [[shoebill]] and [[hamerkop]], and are placed in the order [[Pelecaniformes]]. [[Ibis]]es, [[spoonbill]]s, [[heron]]s, and [[bittern]]s have been classified in the same order. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from [[Oligocene]] strata in France. They are thought to have evolved in the [[Old World]] and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and [[New World]] lineages.\n\nPelicans frequent inland and coastal waters, where they feed principally on fish, catching them at or near the water surface. They are [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] birds, travelling in flocks, [[Cooperative hunting|hunting cooperatively]], and breeding [[bird colony|colonially]]. Four white-plumaged species tend to nest on the ground, and four brown or grey-plumaged species nest mainly in trees. The relationship between pelicans and people has often been contentious. The birds have been persecuted because of their perceived competition with commercial and recreational fishing. Their populations have fallen through [[habitat destruction]], disturbance, and environmental pollution, and three species are of conservation concern. They also have a long history of cultural significance in [[mythology]], and in Christian and [[heraldry|heraldic]] [[iconography]].\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\n\n===Etymology===\nThe genus ''Pelecanus'' was first formally described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''Systema Naturae'''. He described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip, linear nostrils, a bare face, and fully webbed feet.

The Dalmatian, pink-backed, and spot-billed were all closely related to one another, while the Australian white pelican was their next-closest relative. The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage, but was the first to diverge from the common ancestor of the other four species. This finding suggests that pelicans evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas, and that preference for tree- or ground-nesting is more related to size than genetics.<ref name=kennedy>{{cite journal|author1=Kennedy, Martyn |author2=Taylor, Scott A. |author3=N\u00e1dvorn\u00edk, Petr |author4=Spencer, Hamish G. |date=2013|title=The phylogenetic relationships of the extant pelicans inferred from DNA sequence data|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=66|issue=1|pages=215\u201322|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2012.09.034|pmid=23059726 |url=https://www.colorado.edu/lab/taylor/sites/default/files/attached-files/kennedy_et_al._2012.pdf}}</ref><!-- cites para -->\n\n{| style=\"width:98%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#d3d3a4;\" colspan=\"4\"|Living species of ''Pelecanus''\n|-\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|Common and binomial names<ref name=\"zoonomen\">{{cite web | url =http://www.zoonomen.net/avtax/pele.html |title = Zoological Nomenclature Resource: Pelecaniformes (Version 2.003) |date =14 December 2011|publisher = zoonomen.net |accessdate=21 May 2012 }}</ref>\n!

The device of \"a pelican in her piety\" or \"a pelican vulning (from Latin ''vulno'', \"to wound\") herself\" was used in [[heraldry]]. An older version of the myth is that the pelican used to kill its young then resurrect them with its blood, again analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus. Likewise, a folktale from India says that a pelican killed her young by rough treatment, but was then so contrite that she resurrected them with her own blood.<ref name=NSS/>\n\nThe legends of self-wounding and the provision of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill. In reality, it often presses this onto its chest to fully empty the pouch. Another possible derivation is the tendency of the bird to rest with its bill on its breast; the Dalmatian pelican has a blood-red pouch in the early breeding season and this may have contributed to the myth.<ref name=NSS/>\n\n====Heraldry====\n[[File:Coa Hungary Family Kiszely - Benedekfalva.svg|thumb|The arms of the Kiszely family of [[Benedekfalva]] depict a \"pelican in her piety\" both in the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] and [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]].]]\nPelicans have featured extensively in heraldry, generally using the Christian symbolism of the pelican as a caring and self-sacrificing parent.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Saunders|first1=Rev.

This document, created in 2005, provides the basis for accrediting student groups on campus. The student groups listed as Primary Student Organizations under the policy are:\n\n* The Central Student Association (CSA)\n* The Graduate Students' Association (GSA)\n* The College of Arts Student Union (CA-SU)\n* The College of Biological Science Student Council (CBS-SC)\n* The Gordon S. Lang School of Business and Economics Students' Association (Lang-SA)\n* The College of Physical & Engineering Science Student Council (CPES-SC)\n* The College of Social & Applied Human Sciences Student Alliance (CSAHS-SA)\n* The Student Federation of the [[Ontario Agricultural College]] (SF-OAC)\n* The Central Veterinary Students' Association (CVSA)\n* Interhall Council (IHC)\n\nEach of the above PSOs accredit and thus are held accountable for many of the various clubs and student groups on campus. The CSA accredits the most student groups, with approximately 70 accredited today. Generally CSA-accredited groups are special interest groups like CHAT (a multi-lingual group), the Jewish Students' Organization (JSO), or the Muslim Students' Association, catering to those who wish to begin new interest-specific clubs on campus. The College Governments (CA-SU, CBS-SC, CME-SA, CPES-SC, CSAHS-SA, SF-OAC and the CVSA) accredit academically focused groups while IHC accredits 14 groups (includes the temporary residence Brock House for the 2011/2012 year) as hall councils, one for each residence hall on campus.\n\nAcross campus, members of the Residence Student Government, known as [[Interhall Council]], contribute to the programming in each hall. This group of 62 elected members works with students within their halls and are also responsible for facilitating a hall council for hall members to attend. During the 2011/2012 year, a council was stricken at the West Residence Family Housing units and the temporary Brock House residence, bringing the total number of councils to 14. Interhall Council also acts as a liaison between students and Student Housing Services, University Administration, and other on-campus organizations.\n\n===Organization===\nThe governance of the University of Guelph is a [[bicameral]] system consisting of the Senate and the Board of Governors.\n\n==Athletics==\nThe university is represented in the [[Ontario University Athletics]] and the [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] by the [[Guelph Gryphons]]. The school colors are red, black and yellow or gold. UofG's mascot is a Gryphon named Gryph. The university offers 15 [[Varsity team|varsity]] sports for men and 15 for women. OUA only sports include [[baseball]] (men), [[figure skating]] (men & women), [[golf]], [[Nordic skiing]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], and [[rugby union]] (men). Currently 7 out of every 10 Guelph students participate in athletics, recreation or fitness programming.\n\nNationally, the OUA is one of the [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|CIS]] conferences, along with [[Atlantic University Sport]], [[Canada West Universities Athletic Association]], and the [[Quebec Student Sports Federation]]. CIS sports which UG participates in include [[basketball]], [[cross country running]], [[field hockey]] (women), [[Canadian football]] (men), [[ice hockey]], rugby union (women), [[soccer]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[track & field]], [[volleyball]] and [[wrestling]].\n\nThe Gryphon's men's football team won its only national championship in 1984. In 2008 the Gryphon's men's lacrosse team won the Baggataway Cup at the Canadian national field lacrosse champions with a 14\u20139 win over McGill University at Ron Joyce Stadium in Hamilton. The Gryphons are particularly well known for their exploits in athletics, having won the men's and women's [[cross country running|cross-country]] titles consecutively six (2006\u2013present) and seven (2007\u2013present) times respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.cis-sic.ca/championships/xc/2011-12/releases/20111107-cis|title=2011 CIS cross-country championships: Guelph looking for sixth consecutive sweep|publisher=|accessdate=July 5, 2015}}</ref> The Gryphons won the men's track & field title in 2010, and both the men's and women's titles in 2008.

Rumoured to have seen battle during the [[War of 1812]], Old Jeremiah was last fired in April 1913. After [[World War I]], the gun's barrel was plugged and it was brought to campus by students as a sign of remembrance for those lost in battle. It is often referred to simply and affectionately as ''The Cannon''. During the 1970s, Old Jeremiah was briefly relocated to Johnston Green and renamed the Big Johnston.\n\nAs a result of jovial rivalry between Engineering and Agricultural Science students (\"Aggies\"), the cannon has enjoyed plenty of movement around the Guelph campus in the past as a result of practical jokes between the two majors. Although it is nearly impossible to determine the cannon's previous locations, it is rumoured to have travelled all over campus, at one point even perching on top of MacNaughton (a prominent university building containing the bookstore), and at another even disappearing altogether and showing up a day later on the [[University of Western Ontario]] campus. Eventually, fed up with the movement of Old Jeremiah, university officials cemented the cannon in place where it sits today. However, as a final stab at humour, a group of students shifted the still-mobile direction of the cannon's face, and aimed it at the fourth floor of the University Centre, home of the institution's senior administration. Old Jeremiah rests in this position today.\n\nDespite its movement, the cannon enjoyed relative tranquility until the 1950s when an aspiring entrepreneurial student came up with the idea of painting a message on the highly visible landmark. The act of \"painting the cannon\" has since become a campus tradition with students, residences, sports teams, clubs and others braving the early morning hours to paint messages on the cannon, most often about upcoming events but also including birthday announcements, wedding proposals and insults. The etiquette governing \"painting the cannon\" is unofficial but well understood: 1) do not begin painting the cannon until the sun has set, 2) be finished by the time the first students arrive for classes in the morning, and 3) avoid profanity or coarse language. It is a well-accepted practice to \"guard\" the cannon until sunrise so as to avoid another person or group painting over one's message.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Jack|title=Painting the Cannon|url=https://gryphlife.uoguelph.ca/news/7654|publisher=University of Guelph|accessdate=October 1, 2017|date=September 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 2011, Master of Fine Arts student and art teacher Dawn Johnston began to strip Old Jeremiah of all the layers of paint it had accumulated since the 1950s as an art project. Calling it \"[her] form of sculpture,\" Johnston completed the project over a week's time within a wooden enclosure to avoid the watchful eyes of passing students. Some students were upset about the removal, claiming Johnston was \"taking away [their] history,\" although the project was done with the approval of university faculty. Upon completion, the enclosure was removed and the bare cannon was revealed, however the tradition of painting Old Jeremiah has since resumed.<ref>[http://www.theontarion.com/2010/09/campus-icon-stripped-naked/ theontarion.com]</ref>\n[[File:EURO cannon 1.jpg|thumb|Old Jeremiah - painted by the European Studies students at the University of Guelph]]\n\n===The Pep Rally===\nDuring the University of Guelph's orientation program, which takes place each year at the beginning of Orientation Week, all new students within each residence are taught a dance\u2013often referred to as the Hall Boogie\u2013which is performed to a variety of mixed popular songs. Awards are presented to the Halls which demonstrate the best spirit, creativity, synchronisation and co-ordination. Many of the dances are very impressive, despite being practised in typically an hour or less.\n\nA University of Guelph dance move, Winding Your Toy, is almost always incorporated into each boogie, usually to a bass-heavy dance track. A winding motion is made with the rear hand\u2013as if winding a wind-up toy\u2013while the knees are bent in rhythm. The origins of \"winding the toy\" are not well known, yet it retains notoriety among students and friends of students at the university.\n[[File:College-Royal-Tug-of-War.jpg|left|thumb|245px|A team of Aggies during tug-of-war at College Royal]]\n\nThe Rally is the kick-off to the remainder of orientation activities. The University of Guelph must apply for a special noise permit for the event as the activity can often be heard for miles.\n\nIn 2004, \"Student Power\" was introduced as a low-key alternative event to the Pep Rally for anyone who may not be as inclined to participate in the highly energetic and boisterous Pep Rally.\n\nDuring the renovation the location the Pep Rally is held (The School's football field) in 2012, an event named \"Rally for Change\" was held in place; in which hundreds of University of Guelph students went out into the local community and did street performances to raise money for Cancer research. The Pep Rally was held on a later date. This event has since also become a tradition with plans for it to also be incorporated in the orientation program in 2013.\n\n===College Royal===\nAn annual feature of the university is its open house, known as College Royal. For a weekend each March, every part of the campus and its programs is exhibited to the public, from the barns of the Agricultural College to the sugar bush in the arboretum. It is highly popular with visitors of all ages, especially families with children who take advantage of the March break (the usual Ontario school break) to have an outing.\n\nThe 2006 College Royal was visited by [[Rick Mercer]], taping a segment for his show, the ''[[Rick Mercer Report]]''.\n\n==Student media==\n;Newspapers and magazines:\n*''[[The Ontarion]]'' \u2013 since 1951 and publishes every Thursday\n*''The Peak''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://peakmag.net/ |title=The Peak Magazine}}</ref>\n*''Hornblower: The HTM Magazine'' \u2013 since 1973, official publication of the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/hornblower |title=Hospitality and Tourism Industry Management Magazine through the school of HTM @ UoG |publisher=Hornblower |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}</ref>\n*''At Guelph'' \u2013 university's official newspaper\n*''The Portico'' \u2013 magazine sent to alumni each semester to keep them in touch with the university\n*''Osnap'' \u2013 monthly humour publication put out by the engineering society covering events\n\n;Online:\nThe Cannon<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecannon.ca/ |title=The Cannon}}</ref> is an online website co-founded by The Guelph Campus Co-operative and the CSA created for and funded by [[undergraduate]] students. Although it has a paid editor, all students are encouraged to submit news articles, announcements for upcoming events, opinion pieces, digital photographs and other content Guelph students may find interesting or useful. Founded in September 2002, the site has features such as ''Rate-a-Prof'', where students share insight and opinions about professors, and a free classifieds section, available as a means of buying and selling used textbooks and course materials. The name of the site is a reference to Old Jeremiah, as the website parallels the use of the cannon as a campus-wide message board. The university also has a multitude of independent student run pages in apps such as Instagram. The biggest and most popular of which is @uog_memes. This page is part of an array of other university meme pages focused on the struggles of being a student while also pointing out irrational actions done by the university and its staff. All this is done by either the creator or other Guelph students producing a meme about a topic related to the UofG and posting it for the student body to enjoy. @uog_memes is at 10800 followers as of April first 2020. The identity if its admin(s) is still unknown, although the students of the university still continue to search for the elusive character. \n\n;Radio\n\n*[[CFRU-FM]] is a community campus station serving the students and community of Guelph.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{main|List of University of Guelph people}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Canadian government scientific research organizations]]\n* [[Canadian industrial research and development organizations]]\n* [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]]\n* [[Canadian university scientific research organizations]]\n* [[Higher education in Ontario]]\n* [[List of Ontario Universities]]\n* [[Muck Crops Research Station]]\n* [[Ontario Student Assistance Program]]\n* [[University of Guelph Arboretum]]\n*[[LABash]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* David R.

This document, created in 2005, provides the basis for accrediting student groups on campus. The student groups listed as Primary Student Organizations under the policy are:\n\n* The Central Student Association (CSA)\n* The Graduate Students' Association (GSA)\n* The College of Arts Student Union (CA-SU)\n* The College of Biological Science Student Council (CBS-SC)\n* The Gordon S. Lang School of Business and Economics Students' Association (Lang-SA)\n* The College of Physical & Engineering Science Student Council (CPES-SC)\n* The College of Social & Applied Human Sciences Student Alliance (CSAHS-SA)\n* The Student Federation of the [[Ontario Agricultural College]] (SF-OAC)\n* The Central Veterinary Students' Association (CVSA)\n* Interhall Council (IHC)\n\nEach of the above PSOs accredit and thus are held accountable for many of the various clubs and student groups on campus. The CSA accredits the most student groups, with approximately 70 accredited today. Generally CSA-accredited groups are special interest groups like CHAT (a multi-lingual group), the Jewish Students' Organization (JSO), or the Muslim Students' Association, catering to those who wish to begin new interest-specific clubs on campus. The College Governments (CA-SU, CBS-SC, CME-SA, CPES-SC, CSAHS-SA, SF-OAC and the CVSA) accredit academically focused groups while IHC accredits 14 groups (includes the temporary residence Brock House for the 2011/2012 year) as hall councils, one for each residence hall on campus.\n\nAcross campus, members of the Residence Student Government, known as [[Interhall Council]], contribute to the programming in each hall. This group of 62 elected members works with students within their halls and are also responsible for facilitating a hall council for hall members to attend. During the 2011/2012 year, a council was stricken at the West Residence Family Housing units and the temporary Brock House residence, bringing the total number of councils to 14. Interhall Council also acts as a liaison between students and Student Housing Services, University Administration, and other on-campus organizations.\n\n===Organization===\nThe governance of the University of Guelph is a [[bicameral]] system consisting of the Senate and the Board of Governors.\n\n==Athletics==\nThe university is represented in the [[Ontario University Athletics]] and the [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] by the [[Guelph Gryphons]]. The school colors are red, black and yellow or gold. UofG's mascot is a Gryphon named Gryph. The university offers 15 [[Varsity team|varsity]] sports for men and 15 for women. OUA only sports include [[baseball]] (men), [[figure skating]] (men & women), [[golf]], [[Nordic skiing]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], and [[rugby union]] (men). Currently 7 out of every 10 Guelph students participate in athletics, recreation or fitness programming.\n\nNationally, the OUA is one of the [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|CIS]] conferences, along with [[Atlantic University Sport]], [[Canada West Universities Athletic Association]], and the [[Quebec Student Sports Federation]]. CIS sports which UG participates in include [[basketball]], [[cross country running]], [[field hockey]] (women), [[Canadian football]] (men), [[ice hockey]], rugby union (women), [[soccer]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[track & field]], [[volleyball]] and [[wrestling]].\n\nThe Gryphon's men's football team won its only national championship in 1984. In 2008 the Gryphon's men's lacrosse team won the Baggataway Cup at the Canadian national field lacrosse champions with a 14\u20139 win over McGill University at Ron Joyce Stadium in Hamilton. The Gryphons are particularly well known for their exploits in athletics, having won the men's and women's [[cross country running|cross-country]] titles consecutively six (2006\u2013present) and seven (2007\u2013present) times respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.cis-sic.ca/championships/xc/2011-12/releases/20111107-cis|title=2011 CIS cross-country championships: Guelph looking for sixth consecutive sweep|publisher=|accessdate=July 5, 2015}}</ref> The Gryphons won the men's track & field title in 2010, and both the men's and women's titles in 2008.

Rumoured to have seen battle during the [[War of 1812]], Old Jeremiah was last fired in April 1913. After [[World War I]], the gun's barrel was plugged and it was brought to campus by students as a sign of remembrance for those lost in battle. It is often referred to simply and affectionately as ''The Cannon''. During the 1970s, Old Jeremiah was briefly relocated to Johnston Green and renamed the Big Johnston.\n\nAs a result of jovial rivalry between Engineering and Agricultural Science students (\"Aggies\"), the cannon has enjoyed plenty of movement around the Guelph campus in the past as a result of practical jokes between the two majors. Although it is nearly impossible to determine the cannon's previous locations, it is rumoured to have travelled all over campus, at one point even perching on top of MacNaughton (a prominent university building containing the bookstore), and at another even disappearing altogether and showing up a day later on the [[University of Western Ontario]] campus. Eventually, fed up with the movement of Old Jeremiah, university officials cemented the cannon in place where it sits today. However, as a final stab at humour, a group of students shifted the still-mobile direction of the cannon's face, and aimed it at the fourth floor of the University Centre, home of the institution's senior administration. Old Jeremiah rests in this position today.\n\nDespite its movement, the cannon enjoyed relative tranquility until the 1950s when an aspiring entrepreneurial student came up with the idea of painting a message on the highly visible landmark. The act of \"painting the cannon\" has since become a campus tradition with students, residences, sports teams, clubs and others braving the early morning hours to paint messages on the cannon, most often about upcoming events but also including birthday announcements, wedding proposals and insults. The etiquette governing \"painting the cannon\" is unofficial but well understood: 1) do not begin painting the cannon until the sun has set, 2) be finished by the time the first students arrive for classes in the morning, and 3) avoid profanity or coarse language. It is a well-accepted practice to \"guard\" the cannon until sunrise so as to avoid another person or group painting over one's message.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Jack|title=Painting the Cannon|url=https://gryphlife.uoguelph.ca/news/7654|publisher=University of Guelph|accessdate=October 1, 2017|date=September 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 2011, Master of Fine Arts student and art teacher Dawn Johnston began to strip Old Jeremiah of all the layers of paint it had accumulated since the 1950s as an art project. Calling it \"[her] form of sculpture,\" Johnston completed the project over a week's time within a wooden enclosure to avoid the watchful eyes of passing students. Some students were upset about the removal, claiming Johnston was \"taking away [their] history,\" although the project was done with the approval of university faculty. Upon completion, the enclosure was removed and the bare cannon was revealed, however the tradition of painting Old Jeremiah has since resumed.<ref>[http://www.theontarion.com/2010/09/campus-icon-stripped-naked/ theontarion.com]</ref>\n[[File:EURO cannon 1.jpg|thumb|Old Jeremiah - painted by the European Studies students at the University of Guelph]]\n\n===The Pep Rally===\nDuring the University of Guelph's orientation program, which takes place each year at the beginning of Orientation Week, all new students within each residence are taught a dance\u2013often referred to as the Hall Boogie\u2013which is performed to a variety of mixed popular songs. Awards are presented to the Halls which demonstrate the best spirit, creativity, synchronisation and co-ordination. Many of the dances are very impressive, despite being practised in typically an hour or less.\n\nA University of Guelph dance move, Winding Your Toy, is almost always incorporated into each boogie, usually to a bass-heavy dance track. A winding motion is made with the rear hand\u2013as if winding a wind-up toy\u2013while the knees are bent in rhythm. The origins of \"winding the toy\" are not well known, yet it retains notoriety among students and friends of students at the university.\n[[File:College-Royal-Tug-of-War.jpg|left|thumb|245px|A team of Aggies during tug-of-war at College Royal]]\n\nThe Rally is the kick-off to the remainder of orientation activities. The University of Guelph must apply for a special noise permit for the event as the activity can often be heard for miles.\n\nIn 2004, \"Student Power\" was introduced as a low-key alternative event to the Pep Rally for anyone who may not be as inclined to participate in the highly energetic and boisterous Pep Rally.\n\nDuring the renovation the location the Pep Rally is held (The School's football field) in 2012, an event named \"Rally for Change\" was held in place; in which hundreds of University of Guelph students went out into the local community and did street performances to raise money for Cancer research. The Pep Rally was held on a later date. This event has since also become a tradition with plans for it to also be incorporated in the orientation program in 2013.\n\n===College Royal===\nAn annual feature of the university is its open house, known as College Royal. For a weekend each March, every part of the campus and its programs is exhibited to the public, from the barns of the Agricultural College to the sugar bush in the arboretum. It is highly popular with visitors of all ages, especially families with children who take advantage of the March break (the usual Ontario school break) to have an outing.\n\nThe 2006 College Royal was visited by [[Rick Mercer]], taping a segment for his show, the ''[[Rick Mercer Report]]''.\n\n==Student media==\n;Newspapers and magazines:\n*''[[The Ontarion]]'' \u2013 since 1951 and publishes every Thursday\n*''The Peak''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://peakmag.net/ |title=The Peak Magazine}}</ref> \n*''Hornblower: The HTM Magazine'' \u2013 since 1973, official publication of the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/hornblower |title=Hospitality and Tourism Industry Management Magazine through the school of HTM @ UoG |publisher=Hornblower |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}</ref>\n*''At Guelph'' \u2013 university's official newspaper\n*''The Portico'' \u2013 magazine sent to alumni each semester to keep them in touch with the university\n*''Osnap'' \u2013 monthly humour publication put out by the engineering society covering events\n\n;Online:\nThe Cannon<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecannon.ca/ |title=The Cannon}}</ref> is an online website co-founded by The Guelph Campus Co-operative and the CSA created for and funded by [[undergraduate]] students.

Founded in September 2002, the site has features such as ''Rate-a-Prof'', where students share insight and opinions about professors, and a free classifieds section, available as a means of buying and selling used textbooks and course materials. The name of the site is a reference to Old Jeremiah, as the website parallels the use of the cannon as a campus-wide message board.\n\n;Radio:\n*[[CFRU-FM]] is a community campus station serving the students and community of Guelph.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{main|List of University of Guelph people}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Canadian government scientific research organizations]]\n* [[Canadian industrial research and development organizations]]\n* [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]]\n* [[Canadian university scientific research organizations]]\n* [[Higher education in Ontario]]\n* [[List of Ontario Universities]]\n* [[Muck Crops Research Station]]\n* [[Ontario Student Assistance Program]]\n* [[University of Guelph Arboretum]]\n*[[LABash]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* David R.
