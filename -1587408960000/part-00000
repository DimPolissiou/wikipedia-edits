His father having died about 1799, his mother moved to Aberdeen, where he went to school, and to the [[Marischal College]].{{sfn|Hamilton|1888|p=130}}\n\n==Military career==\nDuff was to become a civil servant of the [[East India Company]], but being impatient at the prospect of delay in obtaining a post he accepted a cadetship in 1805 and sailed for Bombay.  After completing the cadet training in Bombay, he joined the Bombay Grenadiers{{when|date=September 2012}}.  In 1808 Duff participated as an ensign in the storming of [[Malia, Gujarat|Maliah]], a fortified stronghold of [[Filibuster (military)|freebooter]]s, where he displayed bravery.  At an unusually early age{{when|date=September 2012}} he became adjutant to his regiment and Persian interpreter, and was even more influential in it than this position indicated{{how|date=September 2012}}.  While still a lieutenant he attracted the attention of [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], then Company resident of [[Pune|Poona]], and became, along with [[Henry Pottinger]], his assistant and devoted friend.  He was particularly successful in understanding the native character, and in discovering the mean between too rapid reform and too great deference to native prejudice and immobility.\n\nDuring the long operations against the Peshwa [[Bajirao II]], terminating in his overthrow, Grant took a considerable part, both in a civil and in a military capacity, attaining the rank of captain in his regiment.<ref>{{harvnb|Hamilton|1888|p=130}} see Forrest, ''Official Writings of Elphinstone'', pref. memoir</ref>  Upon the settlement of the country he was appointed in 1818 to the important office of resident of [[Satara State]].  His instructions are contained in a letter of Elphinstone's, dated 8 April 1818, and his remuneration was fixed at 2000 rupees per month, with allowances of 1500 rupees per month, which was in addition to an office establishment.<ref>{{harvnb|Hamilton|1888|p=130}} see ''Parliamentary Papers'' 1873, volume xxxviii. part i.</ref>  Here, in the heart of a warlike province, the centre of the [[Maratha Empire|Mahratta confederacy]], with but one European companion and a body of native infantry, he succeeded in maintaining himself in a hostile environment.\n\nBy proclamation dated 11 April 1818, Elphinstone made full powers over to Grant for the arrangement of Satara's affairs of state.

His father having died about 1799, his mother moved to Aberdeen, where he went to school, and to the [[Marischal College]].{{sfn|Hamilton|1888|p=130}}\n\n==Military career==\nDuff was to become a civil servant of the [[East India Company]], but being impatient at the prospect of delay in obtaining a post he accepted a cadetship in 1805 and sailed for Bombay.  After completing the cadet training in Bombay, he joined the Bombay Grenadiers{{when|date=September 2012}}.  In 1808 Duff participated as an ensign in the storming of [[Malia, Gujarat|Maliah]], a fortified stronghold of [[Filibuster (military)|freebooter]]s, where he displayed bravery.  At an unusually early age{{when|date=September 2012}} he became adjutant to his regiment and Persian interpreter, and was even more influential in it than this position indicated{{how|date=September 2012}}.  While still a lieutenant he attracted the attention of [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], then Company resident of [[Pune|Poona]], and became, along with [[Henry Pottinger]], his assistant and devoted friend.  He was particularly successful in understanding the native character, and in discovering the mean between too rapid reform and too great deference to native prejudice and immobility.\n\nDuring the long operations against the Peshwa [[Bajirao II]], terminating in his overthrow, Grant took a considerable part, both in a civil and in a military capacity, attaining the rank of captain in his regiment.<ref>{{harvnb|Hamilton|1888|p=130}} see Forrest, ''Official Writings of Elphinstone'', pref. memoir</ref>  Upon the settlement of the country he was appointed in 1818 to the important office of resident of [[Satara (city)|Sattara]] State.  His instructions are contained in a letter of Elphinstone's, dated 8 April 1818, and his remuneration was fixed at 2000 rupees per month, with allowances of 1500 rupees per month, which was in addition to an office establishment.<ref>{{harvnb|Hamilton|1888|p=130}} see ''Parliamentary Papers'' 1873, volume xxxviii. part i.</ref>  Here, in the heart of a warlike province, the centre of the [[Maratha Empire|Mahratta confederacy]], with but one European companion and a body of native infantry, he succeeded in maintaining himself in a hostile environment.\n\nBy proclamation dated 11 April 1818, Elphinstone made full powers over to Grant for the arrangement of Satara's affairs of state.

They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nIn the 1950s, the [[NATO]] response to an attack by the WTO would be \"massive retaliation\" with [[tactical nuclear weapons]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1999-07/features/natos-nuclear-weapons-rationale-first-use |title=NATO's Nuclear Weapons: The Rationale for 'No First Use' |first=Jack |last=Mendelsohn |website=Arms Control Today}}</ref> and conventional forces were seen as secondary. By the early 1970s this resulted in a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} The 1969 [[Nixon Doctrine]]'s [[flexible response]] strategy required a non-nuclear answer to this disparity. The Ansbach Tests suggested this could be a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet.\n\nThis sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} These comments led to the formation of the [[Howze Board]], which enthusiastically supported the use of helicopters in combat. The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these concepts home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the [[British Army of the Rhine]] ran a series of tests known as [[Operation Hell Tank]] with the goal of testing the use of anti-tank missiles against simulated WTO forces. In one operation, Hell Tank IV, the helicopters ran up a 45-to-1 score over tanks that were executing a breakout. The tests also demonstrated that the helicopters were much less useful against tanks in defensive positions with their engines turned off, making them very difficult to spot from the air.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The RUSI Journal |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=53-62 |date=1976 |first=S. |last=Hickey |doi=10.1080/03071847609419264 |title=The British Army and the Battlefield Aerial Vehicle. The Way Ahead.}}</ref>\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Trial by fire==\nThe AAFSS contest resulted in a complex design who's development dragged on for years before it was eventually canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Huey armed with TOW missiles in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, two experimental TOW-firing UH-1's killed twenty-four tanks and dozens of other targets over a three week period without receiving a single hit.]]\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US-supplied equipment that had been captured from ARVN earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe battle opened in earnest on 25 May. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. In another case, a tank crew backed their tank into a house to avoid attack, only to be destroyed by a TOW fired in through a window.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Bright Shining Lie |first=Neil |last=Sheehan |date= 2009 |publisher=Doubleday |page=782 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=I_ECCk6SQQIC&pg=PA782}}</ref> By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses. Basing the entire future of the Canadian Army's European presence would demand better data and testing if it were to go forward.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=136}}{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=58}}\n\n==Tests==\n[[File:Cobra and Kiowa DF-ST-86-10445.JPEG|thumb|right|Ansbach demonstrated the value of the \"hunter/killer\" teams combining the Cobra gunship and Kiowa scout.]]\n[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Ansbach suggested the ''Shilka'' was easy prey for helicopters using pop-up attacks.]]\n\nAll of these changes resulted in intense interest in helicopter combat in the US, Canada and, increasingly, the German [[Bundeswehr]]. The [[United States Army Europe]] began forming plans for extensive tests of helicopter combat for early 1972, with German and Canadian participation. The WTO forces would be made up from Bundeswehr [[Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS]] playing the part of the [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], which had no direct counterpart in NATO.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} [[Laser]]s were used by all vehicles to simulate weapons fire, and laser receivers firing [[smoke grenade]]s registered hits.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=25}}{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nTwo types of combat scenarios were considered. In one, a single AH-1G Cobra attack helicopter simulating a TOW-equipped AH-1Q was paired with two OH-58 helicopters providing forward observation. This sort of \"hunter/killer\" team had been used to great effect in Vietnam. It was not clear this was suitable in an armor-heavy battle expected in Europe, so the same setups were repeated with two Cobras and no Kiohas. Groups of three Leopards with one Vulcan attempted to move forward against this opposition.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} Three separate scenarios were trialed. In the first, the helicopters were working in concert with in-place defensive forces, acting as additional anti-tank weapons. In the second, the goal was to delay an attacking force to give time for other forces to get into position to defend against them.

They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nIn the 1950s, the [[NATO]] response to an attack by the WTO would be \"massive retaliation\" with [[tactical nuclear weapons]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1999-07/features/natos-nuclear-weapons-rationale-first-use |title=NATO's Nuclear Weapons: The Rationale for 'No First Use' |first=Jack |last=Mendelsohn |website=Arms Control Today}}</ref> and conventional forces were seen as secondary. By the early 1970s this resulted in a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} The 1969 [[Nixon Doctrine]]'s [[flexible response]] strategy required a non-nuclear answer to this disparity. The Ansbach Tests suggested this could be a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet.\n\nThis sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} These comments led to the formation of the [[Howze Board]], which enthusiastically supported the use of helicopters in combat. The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these concepts home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the [[British Army of the Rhine]] ran a series of tests known as [[Operation Hell Tank]] with the goal of testing the use of anti-tank missiles against simulated WTO forces. In one operation, Hell Tank IV, the helicopters ran up a 45-to-1 score over tanks that were executing a breakout. The tests also demonstrated that the helicopters were much less useful against tanks in defensive positions with their engines turned off, making them very difficult to spot from the air.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The RUSI Journal |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=53-62 |date=1976 |first=S. |last=Hickey |doi=10.1080/03071847609419264 |title=The British Army and the Battlefield Aerial Vehicle. The Way Ahead.}}</ref>\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Trial by fire==\nThe AAFSS contents resulted in a complex design who's development dragged on for years before it was finally canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Huey armed with TOW missiles in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, two experimental TOW-firing UH-1's killed twenty-four tanks and dozens of other targets over a three week period without receiving a single hit.]]\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US-supplied equipment that had been captured from ARVN earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe battle opened in earnest on 25 May. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. In another case, a tank crew backed their tank into a house to avoid attack, only to be destroyed by a TOW fired in through a window.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Bright Shining Lie |first=Neil |last=Sheehan |date= 2009 |publisher=Doubleday |page=782 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=I_ECCk6SQQIC&pg=PA782}}</ref> By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses. Basing the entire future of the Canadian Army's European presence would demand better data and testing if it were to go forward.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=136}}{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=58}}\n\n==Tests==\n[[File:Cobra and Kiowa DF-ST-86-10445.JPEG|thumb|right|Ansbach demonstrated the value of the \"hunter/killer\" teams combining the Cobra gunship and Kiowa scout.]]\n[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Ansbach suggested the ''Shilka'' was easy prey for helicopters using pop-up attacks.]]\n\nAll of these changes resulted in intense interest in helicopter combat in the US, Canada and, increasingly, the German [[Bundeswehr]]. The [[United States Army Europe]] began forming plans for extensive tests of helicopter combat for early 1972, with German and Canadian participation. The WTO forces would be made up from Bundeswehr [[Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS]] playing the part of the [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], which had no direct counterpart in NATO.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} [[Laser]]s were used by all vehicles to simulate weapons fire, and laser receivers firing [[smoke grenade]]s registered hits.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=25}}{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nTwo types of combat scenarios were considered. In one, a single AH-1G Cobra attack helicopter simulating a TOW-equipped AH-1Q was paired with two OH-58 helicopters providing forward observation. This sort of \"hunter/killer\" team had been used to great effect in Vietnam. It was not clear this was suitable in an armor-heavy battle expected in Europe, so the same setups were repeated with two Cobras and no Kiohas. Groups of three Leopards with one Vulcan attempted to move forward against this opposition.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} Three separate scenarios were trialed. In the first, the helicopters were working in concert with in-place defensive forces, acting as additional anti-tank weapons. In the second, the goal was to delay an attacking force to give time for other forces to get into position to defend against them. In the third, the helicopters were being sent against a successful armored breakthrough with the goal being to kill as many vehicles as possible.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}} A total of 60 trial runs were conducted.{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nAs might be expected, in the breakout scenario the helicopters benefited from a lack of information on the part of the attackers, which were repeatedly engaged at long range and often had no idea there was a helicopter nearby.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}} The value of the hunter/killer teams, in this case, was clear in the results; when acting alone in this scenario, the helicopters often blundered into the tanks and this resulted in the highest losses, six attack helicopters.

However they lost to the [[Philadelphia Wings (1987\u20132014)|Philadelphia Wings]] and failed in their attempt at three consecutive championships.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wings crush Rock hopes Wings 9, Rock 8 ; Late charge falls short in pro lacrosse finale|last=Rush|first=Curtis|date=2001-04-28|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]}}</ref>\n\n==Regular season==\n\n===Conference standings===\n\n{{2001 NLL standings|team=TOR}}\n\n===Game log===\nReference:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nll.com/schedule/team_instance/128878?subseason=57547|title=Toronto Rock - 2001 Regular Season - Game Schedule|accessdate=May 3, 2012|work=NLL.com}}</ref>\n{{NLLGameLog\n  |arena_link=Air Canada Centre\n\n  |game1_date=12/21/2000\n  |game1_opp_link=Ottawa Rebel\n  |game1_team_score=17\n  |game1_opp_score=7\n  |game1_attendance=13333\n\n  |game2_date=12/31/2000\n  |game2_opp_link=Washington Power\n  |game2_loc=MCI Center\n  |game2_loc_link=Capital One Arena\n  |game2_road_game=1\n  |game2_team_score=12\n  |game2_opp_score=13\n  |game2_attendance=1778\n\n  |game3_date=1/5/2001\n  |game3_opp_link=Ottawa Rebel\n  |game3_loc=Corel Centre\n  |game3_loc_link=Scotiabank Place\n  |game3_road_game=1\n  |game3_team_score=16\n  |game3_opp_score=7\n  |game3_attendance=12193\n\n  |game4_date=1/11/2001\n  |game4_opp_link=Albany Attack\n  |game4_team_score=7\n  |game4_opp_score=4\n  |game4_attendance=12222\n\n  |game5_date=1/26/2001\n  |game5_opp_link=Washington Power\n  |game5_team_score=13\n  |game5_opp_score=16\n  |game5_attendance=16373\n\n  |game6_date=1/27/2001\n  |game6_opp_link=Buffalo Bandits\n  |game6_loc=HSBC Arena\n  |game6_loc_link=First Niagara Center\n  |game6_road_game=1\n  |game6_team_score=14\n  |game6_opp_score=13\n  |game6_ot=2\n  |game6_attendance=8452\n\n  |game7_date=2/3/2001\n  |game7_opp_link=New York Saints\n  |game7_loc_link=Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\n  |game7_road_game=1\n  |game7_team_score=14\n  |game7_opp_score=9\n  |game7_attendance=7638\n\n  |game8_date=2/9/2001\n  |game8_opp_link=Philadelphia Wings (1987\u20132014)\n  |game8_team_score=17\n  |game8_opp_score=11\n  |game8_attendance=15497\n\n  |game9_date=2/17/2001\n  |game9_opp_link=Rochester Knighthawks\n  |game9_loc_link=Blue Cross Arena\n  |game9_road_game=1\n  |game9_team_score=7\n  |game9_opp_score=12\n  |game9_attendance=9361\n\n  |game10_date=2/25/2001\n  |game10_opp_link=New York Saints\n  |game10_team_score=10\n  |game10_opp_score=9\n  |game10_ot=1\n  |game10_attendance=17059\n\n  |game11_date=3/10/2001\n  |game11_opp_link=Philadelphia Wings (1987\u20132014)\n  |game11_loc=First Union Center\n  |game11_loc_link=Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)\n  |game11_road_game=1\n  |game11_team_score=11\n  |game11_opp_score=7\n  |game11_attendance=13485\n\n  |game12_date=3/16/2001\n  |game12_opp_link=Columbus Landsharks\n  |game12_loc_link=Nationwide Arena\n  |game12_road_game=1\n  |game12_team_score=8\n  |game12_opp_score=5\n  |game12_attendance=5120\n\n  |game13_date=3/31/2001\n  |game13_opp_link=Columbus Landsharks\n  |game13_team_score=11\n  |game13_opp_score=8\n  |game13_attendance=19059\n\n  |game14_date=4/5/2001\n  |game14_opp_link=Rochester Knighthawks\n  |game14_team_score=11\n  |game14_opp_score=4\n  |game14_attendance=16700\n}}\n\n==Playoffs==\n\n===Game log===\nReference:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nll.com/schedule/team_instance/128878?subseason=57593|title=Toronto Rock - 2001 Playoffs - Game Schedule|accessdate=May 3, 2012|work=NLL.com}}</ref>\n{{NLLGameLog\n  |arena_link=Air Canada Centre\n\n  |game1_num=Semifinals\n  |game1_date=4/21/2001\n  |game1_opp_link=Washington Power\n  |game1_team_score=10\n  |game1_opp_score=9\n  |game1_attendance=15831\n\n  |game2_num=Championship&nbsp;Game\n  |game2_date=4/27/2001\n  |game2_opp_link=Philadelphia Wings (1987\u20132014)\n  |game2_team_score=8\n  |game2_opp_score=9\n  |game2_attendance=19409\n}}\n\n==Player stats==\n\n===Runners (Top 10)===\n<!-- IMPORTANT: RANK PLAYERS BY Points, then goals, then GP (fewer), then LB, then PIM (fewer) -->\n''Note: GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; LB = Loose Balls; PIM = Penalty Minutes''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/lacrosse/stats/t-TOR/y-2001|title=2001 Toronto Rock statistics|publisher=statscrew.com|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- align=center\n!

It is found in the deep waters off southern [[Angola]] to southern [[Namibia]]. This species is difficult to distinguish from the better-known [[frilled shark]] (''C. anguineus''), but is smaller at maturity and differs in several proportional measurements including head length and mouth width. It seems to be a specialized [[predator]] of smaller sharks, using its flexible jaws and numerous needle-like, recurved teeth to capture and swallow them whole. Reproduction is presumably [[aplacental viviparous]], as with the other member of its family.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe [[frilled shark]] (''C. anguineus'') was long thought to be the only extant member of its [[genus]] and [[family (biology)|family]]. The existence of a second ''Chlamydoselachus'' species off southern Africa was first suspected from a specimen caught off [[L\u00fcderitz]], [[Namibia]] in February 1988, by the South African research ship FRS ''Africana'' (after which this species would eventually be named). The specimen was an adult male smaller than other known mature ''C. anguineus'', and subsequent investigations revealed other consistent differences between frilled sharks in this region and ''C. anguineus''. The new species was termed ''Chlamydoselachus'' \"sp. A\", before being formally described in 2009 by David Ebert and [[Leonard Compagno]], in a paper for the [[scientific journal]] ''Zootaxa''. The [[holotype]] was a {{convert|117|cm|in|abbr=on}} long immature female caught at a depth of {{convert|409|m|ft|abbr=on}} off the [[Cunene River]], Namibia, by the research vessel ''Benguela''.<ref name=\"ebert and compagno\">{{cite journal |author1=Ebert, D.A.  |author2=L.J.V.

The eyes are large and rounded. The sizable mouth is placed terminally on the blunt snout, containing around 30 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 27 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Each tooth has three slender, smooth, recurved cusps, with tiny cusplets between them, and a base that interlocks with the tooth behind it. There are six pairs of long [[gill slit]]s, with the first pair meeting over the throat. The [[pectoral fin]]s are broad and rounded, originating just behind the sixth gill slit. The [[pelvic fin|pelvic]] and [[anal fin]]s are large with long bases and curved margins. The single [[dorsal fin]] is set far back on the body over the anal fin, and has a short base. The [[caudal fin]] is low and somewhat triangular, without a lower lobe.<ref name=\"ebert and compagno\"/>\n\nCompared to the frilled shark, the southern African frilled shark has several proportional differences, including a longer head and gill slits, more widely spaced eyes and [[nares]], broader mouth, and a greater distance between the head and the pectoral fins. The largest known female is the immature {{convert|117|cm|in|abbr=on}} long holotype, and the largest known males measure {{convert|99|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. In life the shark is dark gray, but covered with a thin membrane that gives it a uniform dark brown color.<ref name=\"ebert and compagno\"/>\n\n==Biology and ecology==\nFrom [[stomach]] contents, the southern African frilled shark seems to feed mainly on smaller sharks such as the [[African sawtail catshark]] (''Galeus polli'').
