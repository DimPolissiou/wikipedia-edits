According to lore, a saint had predicted to Sri Swamiji\u2019s parents (Sri Narasimha Sastry and Sri Jaya Lakshmi Mata) that their child would have supreme wisdom and was destined to uplift the mankind. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nHis birth legend claims that Sri Swamiji\u2019s actual birth occurred on a rock in the river [[Kaveri]]. Sri Swamiji\u2019s mother Sri Jaya Lakshmi Mata was in deep [[meditation]] and the child was born covered with [[Vibhuti|holy ash]]. The child was named Satyanarayana. Sri Swamiji\u2019s mother, whom he calls his first Guru, initiated him into spiritual life before her passing away in 1951. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Satyanarayana completed elementary school education. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Initial days as ascetic ==\nInitiated by his mother, Sri Swamiji spent a 12-year cycle in [[S\u0101dhan\u0101|spiritual Sadhana]]. During this period, he spent time in [[Proddatur|Proddutur]], India, in a strict disciplinarian spiritual training under his aunt Yogini Venkamma and in [[Mysore]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the early days of Ascetic Deeksha, Sri Swamiji spent time in [[Kesare]], a small township in Mysore. He chose the place to initiate his activities and in 1966 Sri Swamiji moved to the present site of the Mysore Ashram on Ooty road, which in the early days was only a straw hut in a field. It was there, at Mysore, that Sri Swamiji became Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Swamiji. Since then Sri Swamiji has been helping people in his unique way. People come to him for help with their worldly affairs, or to get healed of physical/mental afflictions, or for guidance in their spiritual practice. Many come to hear Sri Swamiji's Bhajans (divine songs). They also come to celebrate the special festivals in the Vedic traditions.\n\n== Philosophy and teachings ==\n\n=== Spirituality and influence ===\nSri Swamiji had been serving fellow humans, helping them with their problems since his childhood. Sri Swamiji was able to understand their situations, knew their past, present, and future and helped them overcome their difficulties. Some of them became Sri Swamiji's first disciples who were soon followed by more. Sri Swamiji sang Bhajans and kirtans for them and started giving yoga classes in small village huts or on river banks, while wandering the countryside as a monk. Sri Swamiji acquired a large following, which demanded all of his time and attention.\n\n=== ''Dharma Prachaara'' ===\nDharma is the eternal principle, which differentiates humans from other creatures and Dharma alone upholds the peaceful coexistence of various beings in the creation of God. Though many pantheons (different from each other) prevail universally, the principle remains the same. Dattatreya has preached the essence of Universal Brotherhood..\n\n=== Places of worship and temples ===\nEspousing that philosophy of our Sanatana Dharma from Vedic tradition, as taught by Dattatreya, Sri Swamiji has toured the length and breadth of India, establishing various Ashramas (branches of Datta Peetham also called as Gnana Bodha Sabhas) in many states. Each Ashrama consists of a temple for Dattatreya, Annapoorna Mandira (free feeding hall), community hall for bhajans, prayers, meditation; a charitable clinic and important public utility activities. Pujya Swamiji has consecrated more than 85 branches in India including 16 Ashramas dedicated to the 16 incarnations of Dattatreya; Datta Kashi; Datta Rameshwaram; 9 Kshetras dedicated to Nava Nathas; SriPada Vallabha Anagha Datta Kshetram in Pithapuram (Andhra Pradesh, India) dedicated to SriPada Vallabha Swamy, the first incarnation of Datta in Kaliyuga and Sri Narasimha Saraswati Guru Paduka Kshetram dedicated to Swamy Narasimha Saraswati in Ganagapura (Karnataka, India).\n\n=== Vishwa Manava Dharma ===\nThe most important feature of Sri Swamiji's mission is to preach and make people realize the oneness in them. Thus Sri Swamiji always emphasizes that practicing humanity (Maanavataa) should be our motto. Accordingly, Sri Swamiji's message has been widely appreciated in many communities of both Eastern and Western hemispheres. Nationality, creed, sect, caste, race, gender and religion never meant a barrier for Sri Swamiji, across the globe. He has been welcomed by community and religious leaders around the world. Sri Swamiji's discourses, sessions of music for meditation and healing, Yoga classes and other beneficial activities have been conducted in countries such as Holland, Romania, England, USA, UAE, Russia, Malaysia, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, and Austria.\n\n== Ancient ''Vedic Dharma'' ==\nSri Swamiji is the upholder of the ancient Vedic tradition. He has been supporting Vedas and Vedic activities from the beginning. The Mysore Ashrama has a dedicated Gurukula-style Veda school. The Shankara Shiva Vaidya Hari Veda Mandira, of Mysore Ashrama teaches all available Shakhas of all branches of Veda. It is run in the ancient Rishi kula style with a Vidyadhikari, Pracharya and Adhyapakas for each shakha in addition to dedicated schools of Smarta and Agama. Many Ashrama branches have a similar style school if not of the same magnitude.\n\n=== iSERVE ===\nSri Swamiji has founded iSERVE, the Institute of Scientific Research on Vedas. iSERVE has worked hard to identify, classify, publish and propagate the knowledge of Vedas in simple language.

In addition to the therapeutic effect, the efficacy of his music in leading positive and stress-free transformation is being put to use where there is a need for social transformation, in places of high stress like the prisons and in the departments of law enforcement across multiple places in India.\n\n=== Raga Ragini Vidya ===\nSri Swamiji performed continued research for over three decades on before bringing out the therapeutic effects of music. As part of the research, he conducted several experiments on himself understanding the true nature of music and its healing power. The ancient Raga Ragini Vidya has been brought out by Sri Swamiji and is popularized. Sri Swamiji conducts music therapy sessions and healing music concerts worldwide.\n\n=== Live music concerts ===\nWith the ability to use music as medium to supplement medicinal healing, Sri Swamiji was invited by various nations to conduct live music concerts with the celestial message troupe. In addition to music, he uses astronomy, astrology, gem therapy, psychology, hydrotherapy, crystal therapy and the like when conducting live concerts.\n\nHis music concerts are very well received with performances all over the globe in almost all of the prestigious theaters.

This center has piping music based on the personal attributes of the audience and can be used for specialized, community or focused healing sessions. This is part of the holistic healing center Sri Swamiji has established with many branches globally. This center supplements the other branches of medicine in use at the charitable hospitals in Mysore Ashrama and several other branches.\n\n=== ''Nama Sankirtana'' (devotional singing ''aka'' ''Bhajans'')  ===\nAnother form of music is the traditional ''Nama Sankirtan -'' singing the glory of the Lord using his names. This form of music has an equal appeal to the layman and the most devoted. There are several methods in this ranging from singing only one name of the God to singing complex compositions with very high literary values.\n\nSri Swamiji is a composer of Bhajans. He has written more than 2000 songs in Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Marathi and Hindi in praise of various deities. Sri Swamiji is endowed with a gifted voice.

They were in several forms ranging from LPs to online albums. Many of his albums were chartbusters for several weeks on the online audio stores, like iTunes, Google Play and video sites like YouTube and Vimeo.\n== Yoga ==\nSri Swamiji was initiated into Yoga by his mother Jaya Lakshmi. Sri Swamiji's path has been \u2018''Savikalpa Samadhi\u2019'', which is to be in his own contemplative, meditative state always \u2013 still actively attending to different activities. The pantheon was of Raja Yoga and Sri Vidya, which later got strengthened by the Hatha Yoga practice under Aunt Venkamma in Proddutur. Sri Swamiji is considered the Yoga Brahma with all the eight Siddhis realized in him right from the descent of the Avatara.\n\n=== Yoga teachings ===\nIn the initial days of the Mysore Ashrama, circa 1966, Sri Swamiji personally taught several aspects of Yoga to the aspirants. His routine used to start at 4AM with teaching Surya Namaskara to several batches of Yoga students. These initial batches had students even from the US and Europe, who graduated to the Atindriya Yoga classes, an advanced course in Yoga with a deep understanding of how Yoga works and why Prana is important.\n\n=== Kriya Yoga ===\nThe advancement of Yoga classes got him working on reviving the most important discipline of Yoga \u2013 Kriya Yoga. He has further improvised this Raja Yoga and Hatha Yoga encapsulation to capture the important Nadi Shuddhi Kriyas, making it simple to practice.\n\n=== Datta Kriya Yoga Center (Internation) ===\nSri Swamiji's method of teaching Kriya Yoga quickly became very popular and he was invited to various countries to conduct workshops and classes. In the process an independent Datta Kriya Yoga Center was established to work worldwide and help propagate Kriya Yoga in its purest and most practical form. Sri Swamiji has further made it easier for the young adults to follow the path of Yoga by prescribing the discipline of Kumara Kriya Yoga.\n\n=== Sumeru Dhyana Mandira ===\nAs the Pranayama-based Kriya Yoga advances, it leads into meditation that transcends the senses. There are several Kriyas the practitioners will learn and practice as they land in meditation. This Nirguna meditation is further enhanced by advanced Yoga courses and regularly supervised practice in addition to the camps conducted at various places by him.\n\nAs a formal abode and a practice place for meditation, Sri Swamiji has established a monumental structure in Mysore Ashrama, called, Sumeru Dhyana Mandira. This meditation hall is built in a specific structure that attracts the energy, following a Sumeru (or Sri Chakra) in its form. This is an open meditation center that any seeker can come and practice meditation in an enhanced ambiance of falling water from the tip of the building to provide the needed concentration as well as energy.\n\n== International tours ==\nSri Swamiji's mission has required him to undertake over 150 Vishwa Dharma Vijaya Yatras (overseas tours) to many countries. In due course, he has established over 15 centers abroad in UK, US, Malaysia, Europe, Trinidad, Canada and Australia.\n\n=== Universal peace ===\nThe purpose of his global tours is to espouse the sanatana Dharma that teaches the universal brotherhood and Vishwa Manava Dharma \u2013 the basic principles of Sri Swamiji's mission. His tours, are always laced with activities promoting Yoga, music, meditation, silence, peace, universal brotherhood, compassion and uplifting discourses.\n\n=== Music concerts ===\nHealing music concerts and/or the Divya Nama Sankirtana sessions are an integral part of Sri Swamiji's activities during his tours. More than 250 such healing and meditation concerts were conducted so far with millions of attendees.\n\n=== Mouna seminars ===\nAnother feature of his tours, particularly to Europe, is the unique Mouna Seminar. The devotees of Germany, Switzerland and France are awe inspired by the power of silence, Mouna, as explained by Sri Swamiji. Motivated by the instruction and the display of the potential of Mouna \u2013 the devotees have been seeking the silent meditation from Sri Swamiji for over four years now. The number of participants kept increasing year after year and the average age has been coming down showing the growing interest in silence and meditation in younger generations.\n\n== Ashrams and Datta Yoga Centers ==\n\n=== Domestic and international ===\nThe devotees across the globe, have been approaching and appealing to Sri Swamiji to establish a center in their respective places for them to be able to congregate, join for Satsang programs and be able to worship together. Sri Swamiji has established Datta Yoga Centers in places of convenience for devotees of multiple places to come together.\n\nSri Swamiji has established Gnana Bodha Sabhas, the Satsang groups in India and Datta Yoga Centers outside India to advance his mission of universal peace and brotherhood. These centers work towards providing all the civic needs and in carrying out the vision of Sri Swamiji for the humanity in general. All the centers are involved in free feeding, social service, charitable medical activities, education (where possible) and the likes.\n\nAbout 85 such centers are established as of 2016 all over the world and are dedicated to public. Notable among the centers outside India were Jesus Datta Retreat Center, a minimal facility meditation center in West Pennsylvania. This is a deep forest land with three large identified healing rocks named as Brahma, Vishnu and Siva rocks. People come here to meditate near the rocks which emanate blissful spiritual vibrations. Another Temple established in Frisco, Texas near Dallas is one of the largest prayer halls attached to a temple complex in the United States with a seating capacity of more than 3,500 where the Sanctum Sanctorum is dedicated to the rare green stone (Marakata) Karya Siddhi Hanuman.\n\nYet another temple complex is in Trinidad & Tobago, South America where Sri Swamiji has established the tallest Hanuman outside of India, standing at 85\u2019.\n\n== Social service activities ==\n\n=== Social cause ===\nSri Swamiji's generosity has transcended all limitations of language, faith or region. Sri Swamiji is equally at ease while raising donations for the renovation of a cathedral in Romania, or for free feeding of hurricane ravaged localities in the US, or to rebuild ancient temples, or to provide stipend to impoverished students among Muslim brethren or to organize orphanages in Peru and Trinidad. ''Sarva Dharma Samanvaya'' seminars and prayers by various communities in Datta Peetham - are regular features of Sri Swamiji's activities.\n\nSocial harmony and promotion of universal brotherhood have been the underlying focus of all of Sri Swamiji's activities.

However, there is still a large section of the under privileged across the world seeking help and support. To ensure that all sections are covered to the extent possible, Sri Swamiji makes an annual effort in donating multiple items of life and livelihood support to identified sections of people through all the Ashrama branches across the world. Products of home employment and self-employment support, transportation support for the challenged, commercial three-wheelers for the unemployed youth \u2013 are some of the support program features initiated by Sri Swamiji. Creating employment support, health activities and supporting the government machinery by donating ambulances to police units, emergency response vehicles to hospitals and the likes are some of the other activities.\n\n=== Share Your Food ===\nWith the scarcity of food grains increasing world over, Sri Swamiji has advised all the devotees to take a pledge on not just minimizing the wastage, but also to ensure that the food is shared among fellow beings. The Share-Your-Food is a strong going campaign where all the devotees globally, give up one meal to conserve the food and share that meal with the under-privileged.\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nIdentifying the acute need for healthcare support across the globe, Sri Swamiji has made it a regular feature in his Ashrama activities.

He supports rural education by constructing, furnishing and providing education support to chosen deep and interior places where there was previously no education.\n\n=== Annual titles ===\nTo promote, uphold and propagate the ancient wisdom, in respect of the scholars of various fields, Sri Swamiji has established the practice of honoring personalities of chosen expertise annually.\n\nThe coveted titles of \n* Veda Nidhi \n* Shastra Nidhi\n* Nada Nidhi\n* Kala Nidhi \n* Asthana Vidwan\n* Vishwa Bandhu \n* Jaya Lakshmi Mata award\n* Shuka Vana Award\nare very prestigious for the Peetham as well as the recipients.\n\n=== Mass marriages ===\nAnother important annual feature of Sri Swamiji's activities is to support local communities of weaker sections by conducting mass marriages.

To enable the communities to pray together and celebrate the festivals, Sri Swamiji supports the temple and worship place construction in various localities.

There are several such temples established under Sri Swamiji's guidance running independently, supporting the worship needs of the communities helping and improving the social harmony.\n\n== Research activities ==\nIt is an education to learn all of Ashrama objectives, objects and Sri Swamiji's activities and how helpful they are to all the people. To that extent all the above are open for research. Supporting such initiatives, Sri Swamiji has opened multiple research centers having personally spent significant effort in all such research initiatives.\n\nSeveral such research initiatives are supported by Sri Swamiji, which are formally being recognized by universities globally, including research on his music therapy and research in the avian activities.\n\nResearch theses were submitted by multiple doctoral graduate aspirants on his music therapy and the healing effects of his music.\n\nCurrently, there is a unique in-house research being carried out at Shuka Vana, the avian rehabilitation center of the Ashrama, to find the path breaking gene structure associated with parrots and their varying levels of talking ability. This is expected in the coming 12\u201318 months to be published and appropriately recognized.\n\n=== Vishwam Museum ===\nVishwam, the unique museum in Mysore Ashrama is an extended support of all the research activities and the doctoral, post-doctoral graduate students can work on their own initiative to research the life and works of Sri Swamiji using the documented artefacts available.\n\nVishwam is a museum of the rarest collection of all articles, artifacts and catalogued supporting items that can help such ongoing and future research for any registered, interested student community and/or institution.\n\n=== Healing music research ===\nA recorded research of the healing aspects of music on an under developed baby delivered has been documented by a South American student which thesis was awarded doctoral degree for the work.\n\n=== Psychiatric Research Institute, Arkansas ===\nThe University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and the Psychiatric Research Institute Center of Arkansas have conducted independent research on Sri Swamiji's music and its therapeutic effects. The center prescribed Sri Swamiji's recorded healing music albums for several patients who have shown a remarkable progress in their mental health. The recorded readings of the mind maps and neurographs were made available for any further studies. \n\n== Environment ==\nSri Swamiji's love for greenery and ecology is legendary. The Gardens in the Ashrama have developed over the past four decades under the enduring and affectionate attention of Sri Swamiji. The horticultural activities in Ashrama started with the planting of hundreds of organic coconut trees on its western boundary. Followed by cultivation of flowers and herbal plants and shade-giving palm trees \u2013 Ashrama has become a hub of horticultural activity. From 1986, Sri Swamiji dedicated gardens to specific aspects of creation: Rashi Vana (plants connected with signs in the zodiac system), Nakshatra Vana (plants connected with the 27 stars of Indian astrology), Raga Vana (plants connected with the sounds of Indian music scale), Saptarshi Vana (seven plants connected with the seven great Indian sages \u2013 the big dipper) and Panchayatana Vana (five gardens of plants connected with worship)\n\n=== Bonsai culture and support ===\nBeing a keen nature lover, Sri Swamiji has special interest in developing spiritual gardens thereby enlightening people about the divinity of Mother Nature.\n\nSri Swamiji has been at the forefront of Bonsai development. Kishkindha Moolika Bonsai Garden is an exquisite collection of more than 1,000 carefully shaped and miniaturized trees including herbal medicinal plants grown over a hectare. The trees have been aesthetically displayed in oriental garden setting amidst the tranquil surroundings.\n\nThe various gardens described above stand testimonials to Sri Swamiji's innovative zeal and zest for evolving new paradigms for adoring and worshiping nature. The Bonsai garden in the Ashrama is shining gem in the glittering crown called Avadhoota Datta Peetham in Mysore.\n\n=== Avian support and Shukavana<ref name=\"SOM_20150118\">{{cite news|url=http://www.starofmysore.com/main.asp?type=specialnews|title=Shuka Vana: Rehabilitation centre for birds|date=18 January 2015|work=[[Star of Mysore]]|accessdate=22 January 2015|authorlink=Kenneth Shishir}}</ref>    ===\nSri Swamiji has established Shuka Vana, an avian park, the rehabilitation center for birds \u2013 in the serene premises of the Ashrama in Mysore.

Sri Swamiji acquired a large following, which demanded all of his time and attention.\n\n=== ''Dharma Prachaara'' ===\nDharma is the eternal principle, which differentiates humans from other creatures and Dharma alone upholds the peaceful coexistence of various beings in the creation of God.

This form of music has an equal appeal to the layman and the most devoted.

He has written more than 2000 songs in Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Marathi and Hindi in praise of various deities. Sri Swamiji is endowed with a gifted voice.

They were in several forms ranging from LPs to online albums. Many of his albums were chartbusters for several weeks on the online audio stores, like iTunes, Google Play and video sites like YouTube and Vimeo.\n== Yoga ==\nSri Swamiji was initiated into Yoga by his mother Jaya Lakshmi. Sri Swamiji's path has been \u2018''Savikalpa Samadhi\u2019'', which is to be in his own contemplative, meditative state always \u2013 still actively attending to different activities. The pantheon was of Raja Yoga and Sri Vidya, which later got strengthened by the Hatha Yoga practice under Aunt Venkamma in Proddutur. Sri Swamiji is considered the Yoga Brahma with all the eight Siddhis realized in him right from the descent of the Avatara.\n\n=== Yoga teachings ===\nIn the initial days of the Mysore Ashrama, circa 1966, Sri Swamiji personally taught several aspects of Yoga to the aspirants. His routine used to start at 4AM with teaching Surya Namaskara to several batches of Yoga students. These initial batches had students even from the US and Europe, who graduated to the Atindriya Yoga classes, an advanced course in Yoga with a deep understanding of how Yoga works and why Prana is important.\n\n=== Kriya Yoga ===\nThe advancement of Yoga classes got him working on reviving the most important discipline of Yoga \u2013 Kriya Yoga. He has further improvised this Raja Yoga and Hatha Yoga encapsulation to capture the important Nadi Shuddhi Kriyas, making it simple to practice.\n\n=== Datta Kriya Yoga Center (Internation) ===\nSri Swamiji's method of teaching Kriya Yoga quickly became very popular and he was invited to various countries to conduct workshops and classes. In the process an independent Datta Kriya Yoga Center was established to work worldwide and help propagate Kriya Yoga in its purest and most practical form. Sri Swamiji has further made it easier for the young adults to follow the path of Yoga by prescribing the discipline of Kumara Kriya Yoga.\n\n=== Sumeru Dhyana Mandira ===\nAs the Pranayama-based Kriya Yoga advances, it leads into meditation that transcends the senses. There are several Kriyas the practitioners will learn and practice as they land in meditation. This Nirguna meditation is further enhanced by advanced Yoga courses and regularly supervised practice in addition to the camps conducted at various places by him.\n\nAs a formal abode and a practice place for meditation, Sri Swamiji has established a monumental structure in Mysore Ashrama, called, Sumeru Dhyana Mandira.

These centers work towards providing all the civic needs and in carrying out the vision of Sri Swamiji for the humanity in general. All the centers are involved in free feeding, social service, charitable medical activities, education (where possible) and the likes.\n\nAbout 85 such centers are established as of 2016 all over the world and are dedicated to public.

However, there is still a large section of the under privileged across the world seeking help and support. To ensure that all sections are covered to the extent possible, Sri Swamiji makes an annual effort in donating multiple items of life and livelihood support to identified sections of people through all the Ashrama branches across the world. Products of home employment and self-employment support, transportation support for the challenged, commercial three-wheelers for the unemployed youth \u2013 are some of the support program features initiated by Sri Swamiji. Creating employment support, health activities and supporting the government machinery by donating ambulances to police units, emergency response vehicles to hospitals and the likes are some of the other activities.\n\n=== Share Your Food ===\nWith the scarcity of food grains increasing world over, Sri Swamiji has advised all the devotees to take a pledge on not just minimizing the wastage, but also to ensure that the food is shared among fellow beings.

Every branch of an Ashrama will have a charitable clinic providing free consulting services and medicines for the visiting patients.\n\nThe holistic healing center in Mysore is the guiding light for all the medical activities of the Ashrama and its branches. The center in Mysore has dedicated facilities, staff and support in all the fields of medicine, viz., allopathy, Ayurveda, naturopathy and homeopathy. Several thousands of nearby places and visiting patients get the benefit of the free medical support from this center.

He supports rural education by constructing, furnishing and providing education support to chosen deep and interior places where there was previously no education.\n\n=== Annual titles ===\nTo promote, uphold and propagate the ancient wisdom, in respect of the scholars of various fields, Sri Swamiji has established the practice of honoring personalities of chosen expertise annually.\n\nThe coveted titles of \n* Veda Nidhi \n* Shastra Nidhi\n* Nada Nidhi\n* Kala Nidhi \n* Asthana Vidwan\n* Vishwa Bandhu \n* Jaya Lakshmi Mata award\n* Shuka Vana Award\nare very prestigious for the Peetham as well as the recipients.\n\n=== Mass marriages ===\nAnother important annual feature of Sri Swamiji's activities is to support local communities of weaker sections by conducting mass marriages.

To enable the communities to pray together and celebrate the festivals, Sri Swamiji supports the temple and worship place construction in various localities. The support of such activities is much appreciated by the public and is shown in the way it is consumed. There are several such temples established under Sri Swamiji's guidance running independently, supporting the worship needs of the communities helping and improving the social harmony.\n\n== Research activities ==\nIt is an education to learn all of Ashrama objectives, objects and Sri Swamiji's activities and how helpful they are to all the people. To that extent all the above are open for research. Supporting such initiatives, Sri Swamiji has opened multiple research centers having personally spent significant effort in all such research initiatives.\n\nSeveral such research initiatives are supported by Sri Swamiji, which are formally being recognized by universities globally, including research on his music therapy and research in the avian activities.\n\nResearch theses were submitted by multiple doctoral graduate aspirants on his music therapy and the healing effects of his music.\n\nCurrently, there is a unique in-house research being carried out at Shuka Vana, the avian rehabilitation center of the Ashrama, to find the path breaking gene structure associated with parrots and their varying levels of talking ability.

The recorded readings of the mind maps and neurographs were made available for any further studies. \n\n== Environment ==\nSri Swamiji's love for greenery and ecology is legendary. The Gardens in the Ashrama have developed over the past four decades under the enduring and affectionate attention of Sri Swamiji. The horticultural activities in Ashrama started with the planting of hundreds of organic coconut trees on its western boundary. Followed by cultivation of flowers and herbal plants and shade-giving palm trees \u2013 Ashrama has become a hub of horticultural activity. From 1986, Sri Swamiji dedicated gardens to specific aspects of creation: Rashi Vana (plants connected with signs in the zodiac system), Nakshatra Vana (plants connected with the 27 stars of Indian astrology), Raga Vana (plants connected with the sounds of Indian music scale), Saptarshi Vana (seven plants connected with the seven great Indian sages \u2013 the big dipper) and Panchayatana Vana (five gardens of plants connected with worship)\n\n=== Bonsai culture and support ===\nBeing a keen nature lover, Sri Swamiji has special interest in developing spiritual gardens thereby enlightening people about the divinity of Mother Nature.\n\nSri Swamiji has been at the forefront of Bonsai development. Kishkindha Moolika Bonsai Garden is an exquisite collection of more than 1,000 carefully shaped and miniaturized trees including herbal medicinal plants grown over a hectare. The trees have been aesthetically displayed in oriental garden setting amidst the tranquil surroundings.\n\nThe various gardens described above stand testimonials to Sri Swamiji's innovative zeal and zest for evolving new paradigms for adoring and worshiping nature. The Bonsai garden in the Ashrama is shining gem in the glittering crown called Avadhoota Datta Peetham in Mysore.\n\n=== Avian support and Shukavana<ref name=\"SOM_20150118\">{{cite news|url=http://www.starofmysore.com/main.asp?type=specialnews|title=Shuka Vana: Rehabilitation centre for birds|date=18 January 2015|work=[[Star of Mysore]]|accessdate=22 January 2015|authorlink=Kenneth Shishir}}</ref>    ===\nSri Swamiji has established Shuka Vana, an avian park, the rehabilitation center for birds \u2013 in the serene premises of the Ashrama in Mysore.

Sri Swamiji has written treatises, simplified epic puranas, modern day useful quotes and many more. Many of his literary works have been translated into multiple world languages. All of his publications went for reprints multiple times.\n\nOne of his detailed works has been the Raga Ragini Nada Yogamu \u2013 a treatise on the therapeutic aspects of music explaining how music heals. His Chutuku Sahitya is reviving an age old technique of limerick writing which gave more than 700 small verses guiding the daily life of humans.\n\n=== Books published ===\nSri Swamiji's collection of poems, Sachchidananda Neeti Mala, Chutuku Sahitya, Vedanta Geetalu in Sanskrit, Kannada and Telugu respectively have been a beacon of light for seekers. They illustrate the essence of life in a very simple and lucid language.\n\nThere are at least 100 books written by Sri Swamiji in multiple languages in addition to the hundreds by devotees on him and his spiritual guidance, their experiences and the compilation of his discourses. There were several other books which are translations of his original works carried out by many literary enthusiasts.\n\n== Volunteer corps ==\nSri Swamiji has established a very strong and service oriented volunteer corps, Sri Datta Humane Services, as part of his world renowned institution for the social, and spiritual welfare of mankind. This entity reminds people of their social responsibility towards their fellow beings and encourages them to participate in social welfare as well as service activities.\n\nThe volunteer corps supports multiple initiatives of the Ashrama and some are below:\n\n=== Blood bank support ===\nThere is always a need for blood in various hospitals and banks. Sri Swamiji's instructions made a virtual blood bank open up for operation by SDHS. A 24x7 phone line helps the needy across India get blood in time from donors.\n\n=== Social service activities ===\nSri Swamiji's instructions to carry out the social service is the only constitution for the volunteer corps. The volunteers participate in various activities including but not limited to:\n\n-         Hurricane & flood devastated are/people support\n\n-         Food distribution\n\n-         Free food delivery\n\n-         Medical camps\n\n-         Free specialist camps in rural and hard-to-reach areas\n\n-         Organizing free artificial limb camps\n\n-         Supporting civic events of very high attendance (to the tune of millions of participants)\n\n-         Abandoned dead body disposal support with other organizations\n\nSri Swamiji's volunteers are all over the activities with no regard to the scale, skill and/or hygiene barriers.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ganapathi Sachchidananda}}\n* [http://www.dattapeetham.com Avadhoota Datta Peetham (Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Ashram)]\n* [http://sgsbirds.com SGS Birds Shukavana website]\n* [http://sgsragasagara.org Raga Sagara Concerts website]\n* [http://yogasangeeta.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=297:what-is-the-theory-behind-raga-ragini-vidya&catid=31:general&Itemid=253&directory=253 Yoga Sangeeta: What is the theory behind Raga Ragini Vidya?]\n* [http://www.dycuk.org/concert.html NADA Music of Divinity: Music for Healing and Meditation] c\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sachchidananda, Ganapathi}}\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Indian Hindu religious leaders]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Mysore]]\n[[Category:20th-century Hindu religious leaders]]\n[[Category:21st-century Hindu religious leaders]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "list fmt", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganapathi_Sachchidananda"}

{"title_page": "Experimental music", "text_new": "{{distinguish|text=[[avant-garde music]]}}\n{{short description|Music genre}}\n{{Use Harvard referencing|date=May 2019}}\n'''Experimental music''' is a general label for any music that pushes existing boundaries and genre definitions {{harv|Anon.|n.d.(c)}}. Experimental compositional practice is defined broadly by exploratory sensibilities radically opposed to, and questioning of, institutionalized compositional, performing, and aesthetic conventions in music {{harv|Sun|2013}}. Elements of experimental music include [[Indeterminacy in music|indeterminate music]], in which the composer introduces the elements of chance or unpredictability with regard to either the composition or its performance. Artists may also approach a hybrid of disparate styles or incorporate unorthodox and unique elements {{harv|Anon.|n.d.(c)}}.\n\nThe practice became prominent in the mid-20th century, particularly in Europe and North America. [[John Cage]] was one of the earliest composers to use the term and one of experimental music's primary innovators, utilizing [[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminacy]] techniques and seeking unknown outcomes. In France, as early as 1953, [[Pierre Schaeffer]] had begun using the term ''musique exp\u00e9rimentale'' to describe compositional activities that incorporated [[tape music]], [[musique concr\u00e8te]], and [[elektronische Musik]]. Also, in America, a quite distinct sense of the term was used in the late 1950s to describe [[computer music|computer-controlled composition]] associated with composers such as [[Lejaren Hiller]]. [[Harry Partch]] as well as [[Ivor Darreg]] worked with other tuning scales based on the physical laws for harmonic music. For this music they both developed a group of [[experimental musical instrument]]s. Musique concr\u00e8te ([[French language|French]]; literally, \"concrete music\"),  is a form of [[electroacoustic music]] that utilises [[acousmatic sound]] as a compositional resource. [[Free improvisation]] or free music is [[musical improvisation|improvised music]] without any rules beyond the taste or inclination of the musician(s) involved; in many cases the musicians make an active effort to avoid [[clich\u00e9]]s, i.e. overt references to recognizable musical conventions or genres.\n\n==Definitions and usage==\n===Origins===\nThe Groupe de Recherches de Musique Concr\u00e8te (GRMC), under the leadership of [[Pierre Schaeffer]], organized the First International Decade of Experimental Music between 8 and 18 June 1953. This appears to have been an attempt by Schaeffer to reverse the assimilation of musique concr\u00e8te into the German ''elektronische Musik'', and instead tried to subsume musique concr\u00e8te, ''elektronische Musik'', tape music, and world music under the rubric \"musique experimentale\" {{harv|Palombini|1993a|loc=18}}. Publication of Schaeffer's manifesto {{harv|Schaeffer|1957}} was delayed by four years, by which time Schaeffer was favoring the term \"recherche musicale\" (music research), though he never wholly abandoned \"musique exp\u00e9rimentale\" ({{harvnb|Palombini|1993a|loc=19}}; {{harvnb|Palombini|1993b|loc=557}}).\n\nJohn Cage was also using the term as early as 1955. According to Cage's definition, \"an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen\" {{harv|Cage|1961|loc=39}}, and he was specifically interested in completed works that performed an [[aleatorism|unpredictable action]] {{harv|Mauceri|1997|loc=197}}. In Germany, the publication of Cage's article was anticipated by several months in a lecture delivered by Wolfgang Edward Rebner at the [[Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse]] on 13 August 1954, titled \u201cAmerikanische Experimentalmusik\".  Rebner's lecture extended the concept back in time to include [[Charles Ives]], [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]], and [[Henry Cowell]], as well as Cage, due to their focus on sound as such rather than compositional method {{harv|Rebner|1997}}.\n\n===Alternate classifications===\nComposer and critic [[Michael Nyman]] starts from Cage's definition {{harv|Nyman|1974|loc=1}}, and develops the term \"experimental\" also to describe the work of other American composers ([[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]], [[Earle Brown]], [[Meredith Monk]], [[Malcolm Goldstein]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Terry Riley]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]], etc.), as well as composers such as [[Gavin Bryars]], [[John Cale]], [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]], [[Cornelius Cardew]], [[John Tilbury]], [[Frederic Rzewski]], and [[Keith Rowe]] {{harv|Nyman|1974|loc=78\u201381, 93\u2013115}}. Nyman opposes experimental music to the European [[avant-garde]] of the time ([[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]], [[Mauricio Kagel|Kagel]], [[Iannis Xenakis|Xenakis]], [[Harrison Birtwistle|Birtwistle]], [[Luciano Berio|Berio]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]], and [[Sylvano Bussotti|Bussotti]]), for whom \"The identity of a composition is of paramount importance\" {{harv|Nyman|1974|loc=2 and 9}}. The word \"experimental\" in the former cases \"is apt, providing it is understood not as descriptive of an act to be later judged in terms of success or failure, but simply as of an act the outcome of which is unknown\" {{harv|Cage|1961|lpc=13}}.\n\n[[David Cope]] also distinguishes between experimental and avant garde, describing experimental music as that \"which represents a refusal to accept the [[status quo]]\" {{harv|Cope|1997|loc=222}}. David Nicholls, too, makes this distinction, saying that \"...very generally, avant-garde music can be viewed as occupying an extreme position within the tradition, while experimental music lies outside it\" {{harv|Nicholls|1998|loc=318}}.\n\n[[Warren Burt]] cautions that, as \"a combination of leading-edge techniques and a certain exploratory attitude\", experimental music requires a broad and inclusive definition, \"a series of ''ands'', if you will\", encompassing such areas as \"Cageian influences ''and'' work with low technology ''and'' improvisation ''and'' sound poetry ''and'' linguistics ''and'' new instrument building ''and'' multimedia ''and'' music theatre ''and'' work with high technology ''and'' community music, among others, when these activities are done with the aim of finding those musics 'we don't like, yet,' [citing [[Herbert Br\u00fcn]]] in a 'problem-seeking environment' [citing [[Chris Mann (composer)|Chris Mann]]]\u201d {{harv|Burt|1991|loc=5}}.\n\nBenjamin Piekut argues that this \"consensus view of experimentalism\" is based on an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' \"grouping\", rather than asking the question \"How have these composers been collected together in the first place, that they can now be the subject of a description?\" That is, \"for the most part, experimental music studies ''describes'' {{sic}} a category without really ''explaining'' it\" {{harv|Piekut|2008|loc=2\u20135}}. He finds laudable exceptions in the work of David Nicholls and, especially, Amy Beal {{harv|Piekut|2008|loc=5}}, and concludes from their work that \"The fundamental [[Ontology|ontological]] shift that marks experimentalism as an achievement is that from [[Representative realism|representationalism]] to [[performativity]]\", so that \"an explanation of experimentalism that already assumes the category it purports to explain is an exercise in [[metaphysics]], not ontology\" {{harv|Piekut|2008|loc=7}}.\n\n[[Leonard B. Meyer]], on the other hand, includes under \"experimental music\" composers rejected by Nyman, such as Berio, Boulez and Stockhausen, as well as the techniques of \"total [[serialism]]\" {{harv|Meyer|1994|loc=106\u2013107 and 266}}, holding that \"there is no single, or even pre-eminent, experimental music, but rather a plethora of different methods and kinds\" {{harv|Meyer|1994|loc=237}}.\n\n===Abortive critical term===\nIn the 1950s, the term \"experimental\" was often applied by conservative music critics\u2014along with a number of other words, such as \"engineers art\", \"musical splitting of the atom\", \"alchemist's kitchen\", \"atonal\", and \"serial\"\u2014as a deprecating jargon term, which must be regarded as \"abortive concepts\", since they did not \"grasp a subject\" {{harv|Metzger|1959|loc=21}}. This was an attempt to marginalize, and thereby dismiss various kinds of music that did not conform to established conventions {{harv|Mauceri|1997|loc=189}}. In 1955, Pierre Boulez identified it as a \"new definition that makes it possible to restrict to a laboratory, which is tolerated but subject to inspection, all attempts to corrupt musical morals. Once they have set limits to the danger, the good ostriches go to sleep again and wake only to stamp their feet with rage when they are obliged to accept the bitter fact of the periodical ravages caused by experiment.\" He concludes, \"There is no such thing as experimental music \u2026 but there is a very real distinction between sterility and invention\" {{harv|Boulez|1986|loc=430 and 431}}. Starting in the 1960s, \"experimental music\" began to be used in America for almost the opposite purpose, in an attempt to establish an historical category to help legitimize a loosely identified group of radically innovative, \"[[Outsider music|outsider]]\" composers. Whatever success this might have had in academe, this attempt to construct a genre was as abortive as the meaningless namecalling noted by Metzger, since by the \"genre's\" own definition the work it includes is \"radically different and highly individualistic\" {{harv|Mauceri|1997|loc=190}}. It is therefore not a genre, but an open category, \"because any attempt to classify a phenomenon as unclassifiable and (often) elusive as experimental music must be partial\" {{harv|Nyman|1974|loc=5}}. Furthermore, the characteristic indeterminacy in performance \"guarantees that two versions of the same piece will have virtually no perceptible musical 'facts' in common\" {{harv|Nyman|1974|loc=9}}.\n\n===Computer composition===\n{{main|Computer music}}\nIn the late 1950s, Lejaren Hiller and L. M. Isaacson used the term in connection with computer-controlled composition, in the scientific sense of \"experiment\" {{harv|Hiller and Isaacson|1959}}: making predictions for new compositions based on established musical technique {{harv|Mauceri|1997|loc=194\u201395}}. The term \"experimental music\" was used contemporaneously for [[electronic music]], particularly in the early ''musique concr\u00e8te'' work of [[Pierre Schaeffer|Schaeffer]] and [[Pierre Henry|Henry]] in France {{harv|Vignal|2003|loc=298}}. There is a considerable overlap between [[Downtown music]] and what is more generally called experimental music, especially as that term was defined at length by Nyman in his book ''Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond'' (1974, second edition 1999).\n\n==History==\n\n===Influential antecedents===\n\nA number of early 20th-century American composers, seen as precedents to and influences on John Cage, are sometimes referred to as the \"American Experimental School\". These include Charles Ives, [[Charles Seeger|Charles]] and [[Ruth Crawford Seeger]], Henry Cowell, [[Carl Ruggles]], and [[John J. Becker|John Becker]] ({{harvnb|Nicholls|1990}}; {{harvnb|Rebner|1997}}).\n\n===New York School===\n{{main|New York School (art)#The composers}}\n{{summarize|from|New York School (art)|better=y|section=y|date=July 2016}}\nArtists: John Cage, Earle Brown, Christian Wolff, Morton Feldman, [[David Tudor]], Related: [[Merce Cunningham]]\n\n===Musique concr\u00e8te===\n{{main|Musique concr\u00e8te}}\nMusique concr\u00e8te ([[French language|French]]; literally, \"concrete music\"),  is a form of [[electroacoustic music]] that utilises [[acousmatic sound]] as a compositional resource.  The compositional material is not restricted to the inclusion of sonorities derived from [[musical instruments]] or [[register (music)|voice]]s, nor to elements traditionally thought of as \"musical\" ([[melody]], [[harmony]], [[rhythm]], [[Meter (music)|metre]] and so on). The theoretical underpinnings of the aesthetic were developed by [[Pierre Schaeffer]], beginning in the late 1940s.\n\n===Fluxus===\n{{main|Fluxus}}\n\n<!-- Artists to be added: [[Nam June Paik]],  [[Charlotte Moorman]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Dick Higgins]], <br /> -->\nFluxus was an artistic movement started in the 1960s, characterized by an increased theatricality and the use of [[mixed media]]. Another known musical aspect appearing in the Fluxus movement was the use of [[Primal therapy|Primal Scream]] at performances, derived from the [[primal therapy]]. [[Yoko Ono]] used this technique of expression {{harv|Bateman|n.d.}}.\n\n===Minimalism===\n{{main|Minimalist music}}\n\n===Transethnicism===\nThe term \"experimental\" has sometimes been applied to the mixture of recognizable music genres, especially those identified with specific ethnic groups, as found for example in the music of [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Chou Wen-chung]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Kevin Volans]], Martin Scherzinger, Michael Blake, and R\u00fcdiger Meyer ({{harvnb|Blake|1999}}; {{harvnb|Jaffe|1983}}; {{harvnb|Lubet|1999}}).\n\n===Free improvisation===\n{{main|Free improvisation}}\n[[Free improvisation]] or [[free music]] is [[musical improvisation|improvised music]] without any rules beyond the taste or inclination of the musician(s) involved; in many cases the musicians make an active effort to avoid overt references to recognizable musical genres. The term is somewhat [[paradoxical]], since it can be considered both as a technique (employed by any musician who wishes to disregard rigid genres and forms) and as a recognizable genre in its own right.\n\n===Game pieces===\n{{main|Game piece (music)}}\n\n==Influence==\n{{See also|Experimental jazz|Experimental pop|Experimental rock}}\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{importance section|date=July 2016}}\n{{specific section|date=July 2016}}\n{{cite-check|section|date=July 2016}}\n}}\n\n[[The Residents]] started in the seventies as an idiosyncratic musical group mixing all kinds of artistic genres like [[pop music]], [[electronic music]], experimental music with [[movie]]s, [[comic book]]s and [[performance art]] {{harv|Ankeny|n.d.}}. [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] composed multi guitar compositions in the late 1970s. Chatham worked for some time with LaMonte Young and afterwards mixed the experimental musical ideas with punk rock in his piece ''Guitar Trio''. [[Lydia Lunch]] started incorporating [[spoken word]] with [[punk rock]] and [[Mars (band)|Mars]] explored new sliding guitar techniques. [[Arto Lindsay]] neglected to use any kind of musical practise or theory to develop an idiosyncratic atonal playing technique. DNA and [[James Chance]] are other famous no wave artists. Chance later on moved more up to [[Free improvisation]]. The [[No Wave]] movement was closely related to [[transgressive art]] and, just like Fluxus, often mixed [[performance art]] with music.  It is alternatively seen, however, as an avant-garde offshoot of 1970s punk, and a genre related to [[experimental rock]] {{harv|Anon.|n.d.(b)}}.\n\n== References ==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Ankeny|n.d.}}|reference=Ankeny, Jason. n.d.

Experimental compositional practice is defined broadly by exploratory sensibilities radically opposed to, and questioning of, institutionalized compositional, performing, and aesthetic conventions in music {{harv|Sun|2013}}. Elements of experimental music include [[Indeterminacy in music|indeterminate music]], in which the composer introduces the elements of chance or unpredictability with regard to either the composition or its performance. Artists may also approach a hybrid of disparate styles or incorporate unorthodox and unique elements {{harv|Anon.|n.d.(c)}}.\n\nThe practice became prominent in the mid-20th century, particularly in Europe and North America. [[John Cage]] was one of the earliest composers to use the term and one of experimental music's primary innovators, utilizing [[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminacy]] techniques and seeking unknown outcomes. In France, as early as 1953, [[Pierre Schaeffer]] had begun using the term ''musique exp\u00e9rimentale'' to describe compositional activities that incorporated [[tape music]], [[musique concr\u00e8te]], and [[elektronische Musik]]. Also, in America, a quite distinct sense of the term was used in the late 1950s to describe [[computer music|computer-controlled composition]] associated with composers such as [[Lejaren Hiller]]. [[Harry Partch]] as well as [[Ivor Darreg]] worked with other tuning scales based on the physical laws for harmonic music. For this music they both developed a group of [[experimental musical instrument]]s. Musique concr\u00e8te ([[French language|French]]; literally, \"concrete music\"),  is a form of [[electroacoustic music]] that utilises [[acousmatic sound]] as a compositional resource. [[Free improvisation]] or free music is [[musical improvisation|improvised music]] without any rules beyond the taste or inclination of the musician(s) involved; in many cases the musicians make an active effort to avoid [[clich\u00e9]]s, i.e. overt references to recognizable musical conventions or genres.\n\n==Definitions and usage==\n===Origins===\nThe Groupe de Recherches de Musique Concr\u00e8te (GRMC), under the leadership of [[Pierre Schaeffer]], organized the First International Decade of Experimental Music between 8 and 18 June 1953. This appears to have been an attempt by Schaeffer to reverse the assimilation of musique concr\u00e8te into the German ''elektronische Musik'', and instead tried to subsume musique concr\u00e8te, ''elektronische Musik'', tape music, and world music under the rubric \"musique experimentale\" {{harv|Palombini|1993|loc=18}}. Publication of Schaeffer's manifesto {{harv|Schaeffer|1957}} was delayed by four years, by which time Schaeffer was favoring the term \"recherche musicale\" (music research), though he never wholly abandoned \"musique exp\u00e9rimentale\" ({{harvnb|Palombini|1993a|loc=19}}; {{harvnb|Palombini|1993b|loc=557}}).\n\nJohn Cage was also using the term as early as 1955. According to Cage's definition, \"an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen\" {{harv|Cage|1961|loc=39}}, and he was specifically interested in completed works that performed an [[aleatorism|unpredictable action]] {{harv|Mauceri|1997|loc=197}}. In Germany, the publication of Cage's article was anticipated by several months in a lecture delivered by Wolfgang Edward Rebner at the [[Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse]] on 13 August 1954, titled \u201cAmerikanische Experimentalmusik\".  Rebner's lecture extended the concept back in time to include [[Charles Ives]], [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]], and [[Henry Cowell]], as well as Cage, due to their focus on sound as such rather than compositional method {{harv|Rebner|1997}}.\n\n===Alternate classifications===\nComposer and critic [[Michael Nyman]] starts from Cage's definition {{harv|Nyman|1974|loc=1}}, and develops the term \"experimental\" also to describe the work of other American composers ([[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]], [[Earle Brown]], [[Meredith Monk]], [[Malcolm Goldstein]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Terry Riley]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]], etc.), as well as composers such as [[Gavin Bryars]], [[John Cale]], [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]], [[Cornelius Cardew]], [[John Tilbury]], [[Frederic Rzewski]], and [[Keith Rowe]] {{harv|Nyman|1974|loc=78\u201381, 93\u2013115}}. Nyman opposes experimental music to the European [[avant-garde]] of the time ([[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]], [[Mauricio Kagel|Kagel]], [[Iannis Xenakis|Xenakis]], [[Harrison Birtwistle|Birtwistle]], [[Luciano Berio|Berio]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]], and [[Sylvano Bussotti|Bussotti]]), for whom \"The identity of a composition is of paramount importance\" {{harv|Nyman|1974|loc=2 and 9}}. The word \"experimental\" in the former cases \"is apt, providing it is understood not as descriptive of an act to be later judged in terms of success or failure, but simply as of an act the outcome of which is unknown\" {{harv|Cage|1961|lpc=13}}.\n\n[[David Cope]] also distinguishes between experimental and avant garde, describing experimental music as that \"which represents a refusal to accept the [[status quo]]\" {{harv|Cope|1997|loc=222}}. David Nicholls, too, makes this distinction, saying that \"...very generally, avant-garde music can be viewed as occupying an extreme position within the tradition, while experimental music lies outside it\" {{harv|Nicholls|1998|loc=318}}.\n\n[[Warren Burt]] cautions that, as \"a combination of leading-edge techniques and a certain exploratory attitude\", experimental music requires a broad and inclusive definition, \"a series of ''ands'', if you will\", encompassing such areas as \"Cageian influences ''and'' work with low technology ''and'' improvisation ''and'' sound poetry ''and'' linguistics ''and'' new instrument building ''and'' multimedia ''and'' music theatre ''and'' work with high technology ''and'' community music, among others, when these activities are done with the aim of finding those musics 'we don't like, yet,' [citing [[Herbert Br\u00fcn]]] in a 'problem-seeking environment' [citing [[Chris Mann (composer)|Chris Mann]]]\u201d {{harv|Burt|1991|loc=5}}.\n\nBenjamin Piekut argues that this \"consensus view of experimentalism\" is based on an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' \"grouping\", rather than asking the question \"How have these composers been collected together in the first place, that they can now be the subject of a description?\" That is, \"for the most part, experimental music studies ''describes'' {{sic}} a category without really ''explaining'' it\" {{harv|Piekut|2008|loc=2\u20135}}. He finds laudable exceptions in the work of David Nicholls and, especially, Amy Beal {{harv|Piekut|2008|loc=5}}, and concludes from their work that \"The fundamental [[Ontology|ontological]] shift that marks experimentalism as an achievement is that from [[Representative realism|representationalism]] to [[performativity]]\", so that \"an explanation of experimentalism that already assumes the category it purports to explain is an exercise in [[metaphysics]], not ontology\" {{harv|Piekut|2008|loc=7}}.\n\n[[Leonard B. Meyer]], on the other hand, includes under \"experimental music\" composers rejected by Nyman, such as Berio, Boulez and Stockhausen, as well as the techniques of \"total [[serialism]]\" {{harv|Meyer|1994|loc=106\u2013107 and 266}}, holding that \"there is no single, or even pre-eminent, experimental music, but rather a plethora of different methods and kinds\" {{harv|Meyer|1994|loc=237}}.\n\n===Abortive critical term===\nIn the 1950s, the term \"experimental\" was often applied by conservative music critics\u2014along with a number of other words, such as \"engineers art\", \"musical splitting of the atom\", \"alchemist's kitchen\", \"atonal\", and \"serial\"\u2014as a deprecating jargon term, which must be regarded as \"abortive concepts\", since they did not \"grasp a subject\" {{harv|Metzger|1959|loc=21}}. This was an attempt to marginalize, and thereby dismiss various kinds of music that did not conform to established conventions {{harv|Mauceri|1997|loc=189}}. In 1955, Pierre Boulez identified it as a \"new definition that makes it possible to restrict to a laboratory, which is tolerated but subject to inspection, all attempts to corrupt musical morals. Once they have set limits to the danger, the good ostriches go to sleep again and wake only to stamp their feet with rage when they are obliged to accept the bitter fact of the periodical ravages caused by experiment.\" He concludes, \"There is no such thing as experimental music \u2026 but there is a very real distinction between sterility and invention\" {{harv|Boulez|1986|loc=430 and 431}}. Starting in the 1960s, \"experimental music\" began to be used in America for almost the opposite purpose, in an attempt to establish an historical category to help legitimize a loosely identified group of radically innovative, \"[[Outsider music|outsider]]\" composers. Whatever success this might have had in academe, this attempt to construct a genre was as abortive as the meaningless namecalling noted by Metzger, since by the \"genre's\" own definition the work it includes is \"radically different and highly individualistic\" {{harv|Mauceri|1997|loc=190}}. It is therefore not a genre, but an open category, \"because any attempt to classify a phenomenon as unclassifiable and (often) elusive as experimental music must be partial\" {{harv|Nyman|1974|loc=5}}. Furthermore, the characteristic indeterminacy in performance \"guarantees that two versions of the same piece will have virtually no perceptible musical 'facts' in common\" {{harv|Nyman|1974|loc=9}}.\n\n===Computer composition===\n{{main|Computer music}}\nIn the late 1950s, Lejaren Hiller and L. M. Isaacson used the term in connection with computer-controlled composition, in the scientific sense of \"experiment\" {{harv|Hiller and Isaacson|1959}}: making predictions for new compositions based on established musical technique {{harv|Mauceri|1997|loc=194\u201395}}. The term \"experimental music\" was used contemporaneously for [[electronic music]], particularly in the early ''musique concr\u00e8te'' work of [[Pierre Schaeffer|Schaeffer]] and [[Pierre Henry|Henry]] in France {{harv|Vignal|2003|loc=298}}. There is a considerable overlap between [[Downtown music]] and what is more generally called experimental music, especially as that term was defined at length by Nyman in his book ''Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond'' (1974, second edition 1999).\n\n==History==\n\n===Influential antecedents===\n\nA number of early 20th-century American composers, seen as precedents to and influences on John Cage, are sometimes referred to as the \"American Experimental School\". These include Charles Ives, [[Charles Seeger|Charles]] and [[Ruth Crawford Seeger]], Henry Cowell, [[Carl Ruggles]], and [[John J. Becker|John Becker]] ({{harvnb|Nicholls|1990}}; {{harvnb|Rebner|1997}}).\n\n===New York School===\n{{main|New York School (art)#The composers}}\n{{summarize|from|New York School (art)|better=y|section=y|date=July 2016}}\nArtists: John Cage, Earle Brown, Christian Wolff, Morton Feldman, [[David Tudor]], Related: [[Merce Cunningham]]\n\n===Musique concr\u00e8te===\n{{main|Musique concr\u00e8te}}\nMusique concr\u00e8te ([[French language|French]]; literally, \"concrete music\"),  is a form of [[electroacoustic music]] that utilises [[acousmatic sound]] as a compositional resource.  The compositional material is not restricted to the inclusion of sonorities derived from [[musical instruments]] or [[register (music)|voice]]s, nor to elements traditionally thought of as \"musical\" ([[melody]], [[harmony]], [[rhythm]], [[Meter (music)|metre]] and so on). The theoretical underpinnings of the aesthetic were developed by [[Pierre Schaeffer]], beginning in the late 1940s.\n\n===Fluxus===\n{{main|Fluxus}}\n\n<!-- Artists to be added: [[Nam June Paik]],  [[Charlotte Moorman]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Dick Higgins]], <br /> -->\nFluxus was an artistic movement started in the 1960s, characterized by an increased theatricality and the use of [[mixed media]]. Another known musical aspect appearing in the Fluxus movement was the use of [[Primal therapy|Primal Scream]] at performances, derived from the [[primal therapy]]. [[Yoko Ono]] used this technique of expression {{harv|Bateman|n.d.}}.\n\n===Minimalism===\n{{main|Minimalist music}}\n\n===Transethnicism===\nThe term \"experimental\" has sometimes been applied to the mixture of recognizable music genres, especially those identified with specific ethnic groups, as found for example in the music of [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Chou Wen-chung]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Kevin Volans]], Martin Scherzinger, Michael Blake, and R\u00fcdiger Meyer ({{harvnb|Blake|1999}}; {{harvnb|Jaffe|1983}}; {{harvnb|Lubet|1999}}).\n\n===Free improvisation===\n{{main|Free improvisation}}\n[[Free improvisation]] or [[free music]] is [[musical improvisation|improvised music]] without any rules beyond the taste or inclination of the musician(s) involved; in many cases the musicians make an active effort to avoid overt references to recognizable musical genres. The term is somewhat [[paradoxical]], since it can be considered both as a technique (employed by any musician who wishes to disregard rigid genres and forms) and as a recognizable genre in its own right.\n\n===Game pieces===\n{{main|Game piece (music)}}\n\n==Influence==\n{{See also|Experimental jazz|Experimental pop|Experimental rock}}\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{importance section|date=July 2016}}\n{{specific section|date=July 2016}}\n{{cite-check|section|date=July 2016}}\n}}\n\n[[The Residents]] started in the seventies as an idiosyncratic musical group mixing all kinds of artistic genres like [[pop music]], [[electronic music]], experimental music with [[movie]]s, [[comic book]]s and [[performance art]] {{harv|Ankeny|n.d.}}. [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] composed multi guitar compositions in the late 1970s. Chatham worked for some time with LaMonte Young and afterwards mixed the experimental musical ideas with punk rock in his piece ''Guitar Trio''. [[Lydia Lunch]] started incorporating [[spoken word]] with [[punk rock]] and [[Mars (band)|Mars]] explored new sliding guitar techniques. [[Arto Lindsay]] neglected to use any kind of musical practise or theory to develop an idiosyncratic atonal playing technique. DNA and [[James Chance]] are other famous no wave artists. Chance later on moved more up to [[Free improvisation]]. The [[No Wave]] movement was closely related to [[transgressive art]] and, just like Fluxus, often mixed [[performance art]] with music.  It is alternatively seen, however, as an avant-garde offshoot of 1970s punk, and a genre related to [[experimental rock]] {{harv|Anon.|n.d.(b)}}.\n\n== References ==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Ankeny|n.d.}}|reference=Ankeny, Jason. n.d.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nBurren is bounded on the north by [[Derrycassan]] and [[Coologe]] townlands, on the west by Killydrum and Derryniggan townlands in [[County Leitrim]], on the south by [[Raleagh]] townland in Kildallan parish and Lugnagon townland in [[County Leitrim]] and on the east by [[Kiltynaskellan]] and [[Doogary]] townlands in [[Kildallan]] parish. Its chief geographical features are Derrycassan Lake, the [[Shannon\u2013Erne Waterway]] and several stone quarries. Burren is traversed by a public road (which was made in 1913 by Father Peter Brady) and several rural lanes. The townland covers 944 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe earliest surviving mention of the townland name is in a poem (Poem 31, verse 18) composed about 1344 A.D. in the Book of Magauran which gives the name as ''Boireann''-\n\n''Thomas's own son'' ([[Niall M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]], Chief of the clan 1340-1359) \n\n''succeeded him in his castle as was the will of God the creator;\n\n''The heir he secured meant that he himself, Burren's Pillar, did not really die.''\n\n(''Do sduaigh Bhoirne nocher bh\u00e1s''\n\n''An t-oighre do thuair Tom\u00e1s'').<ref>{{Citation |author= L.

Deforestation on the slopes above the town combined with the fact that the city had been built as a series of closely packed houses and buildings \u2013 usually sharing walls \u2013 built in narrow roads paralleling and closely hugging the shore of the lake. Flood waters carrying mud, stones, and boulders rushed down the slopes and filled the streets and buildings with water so rapidly that many people did not have time to escape; the loss of life and property was great. The city rebuilt on the slopes and the British Mandatory government planted the [[Swiss Forest]] on the slopes above the town to hold the soil and prevent similar disasters from recurring.

Many [[Sephardic]] and [[Mizrahi]] Jews settled in the city, following the [[Jewish exodus from Arab countries]] in late 1940s and the early 1950s. Over time, government housing was built to accommodate much of the new population, like in many other [[development town]]s.\n\nIn 1959, during [[Wadi Salib riots]], the \"''Union des Nords-africains'' led by David Ben Haroush, organised a large-scale procession walking towards the nice suburbs of [[Haifa]] creating little damage but a great fear within the population. This small incident was taken as an occasion to express the social malaise of the different [[Mizrahi Jews in Israel|Oriental communities in Israel]] and riots spread quickly to other parts of the country; mostly in towns with a high percentage of the population having North African origins like in Tiberias, in [[Beer-Sheva]], in [[Migdal HaEmek|Migdal-Haemek]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy Allouche|title=The Oriental Communities in Israel 1948-2003|url=http://doczz.fr/doc/96608/the-oriental-communities-in-israel--1948-2003|page= 35}}</ref>\n\nOver time, the city came to rely on tourism, becoming a major Galilean center for Christian pilgrims and internal Israeli tourism. The ancient cemetery of Tiberias and its old synagogues are also drawing religious Jewish pilgrims during religious holidays. PM [[Yitzhak Rabin]] mentioned the town in his memoirs on the occasion of signing the historic peace agreement with Egypt in 1979; and again at the Casablanca Conference in 1994.<ref>M.Gilbert, p.566, 578</ref>\n\nTiberias consists of a small port on the shores of the Galilee lake for both fishing and tourist activities. Since the 1990s, the importance of the port for fishing was gradually decreasing, with the decline of the Tiberias lake level, due to continuing droughts and increased pumping of fresh water from the lake. It is expected that the lake of Tiberias will regain its original level (almost {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=off}} higher than today), with the full operational capacity of Israeli desalination facilities by 2014.\n\nPlans are underway to expand the city with a new neighborhood, Kiryat Sanz, built on a slope on the western side of the Kinneret and catering exclusively to [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jews]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/new-ultra-orthodox-neighborhood-to-be-built-in-israel-s-north-1.422255 New ultra-Orthodox neighborhood to be built in Israel's north], Apr. 3, 2012, Haaretz</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|Central Bureau of Statistics]] (CBS), as of December 2011, 41,700 inhabitants lived in Tiberias.

(rapper)|M.I.A.]]. It was released on 8&nbsp;August 2007 by [[XL Recordings]]. M.I.A. named the album after her mother, in contrast to her first album ''[[Arular]]'', which was named after her father, and said her mother's struggles in life are a major theme of the recording. She began recording the album in early 2006 and worked on the tracks in various locations around the world. \n\nM.I.A.'s debut album ''[[Arular]]'' was released in 2005 and achieved critical acclaim. Plans for the second album, ''Kala'', were first revealed when she spoke later that year of her intention to work with American producer [[Timbaland]], who was anticipated to produce the bulk of the album. However, she was unable to gain a long-term work [[Visa (document)|visa]] to enter the US, reportedly due to her family's connections with [[guerrillas]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. M.I.A. instead opted to record the album at a variety of locations around the world, including [[India]], [[Trinidad]], [[Liberia]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Australia]]. \n\nThe album features musical styles including [[dance music]] and makes extensive use of [[South Asia|South Asian]] music such as that of the [[urumi (drum)|urumee]], a drum used in [[gaana]] music native to [[Tamil Nadu]], India. It was mainly written and produced by M.I.A. and [[Switch (house DJ)|Switch]], and features contributions from Timbaland, [[Diplo]], [[Afrikan Boy]] and [[The Wilcannia Mob]]. M.I.A. and Switch relied heavily on [[Logic Pro]], a [[digital audio workstation]] produced by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and were able to capture vocals and background sounds outside the traditional studio environment, using a microphone and a [[Macbook|Macbook Pro.]] \n\n''Kala'' charted in 14 countries and topped the [[Dance/Electronic Albums|''Billboard'' Top Electronic Albums]] chart. It spawned the singles \"[[Bird Flu (song)|Bird Flu]]\", \"[[Boyz (song)|Boyz]]\", \"[[Jimmy (song)|Jimmy]]\" and the global hit single \"[[Paper Planes (M.I.A. song)|Paper Planes]]\". By 2013, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for sales of at least 500,000 copies in the US, and [[Music Canada#Certification awards|Platinum]] in Canada. It received widespread critical acclaim and was ranked as one of the best albums of 2007 by many publications. Since its initial release, it has often been cited among the best albums of the 21st century by critics, and has been ranked by several publications as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\n== Composition and recording ==\n[[File:Switchdj.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Dave \"[[Switch (house DJ)|Switch]]\" Taylor, who co-wrote and co-produced ''Kala'']]\nM.I.A.

(rapper)|M.I.A.]]. It was released on 8&nbsp;August 2007 by [[XL Recordings]]. M.I.A. named the album after her mother, in contrast to her first album ''[[Arular]]'', which was named after her father, and said her mother's struggles in life are a major theme of the recording. She began recording the album in early 2006 and worked on the tracks in various locations around the world. \n\nM.I.A.'s debut album ''[[Arular]]'' was released in 2005 and achieved critical acclaim. Plans for the second album, ''Kala'', were first revealed when she spoke later that year of her intention to work with American producer [[Timbaland]], who was anticipated to produce the bulk of the album. However, she was unable to gain a long-term work [[Visa (document)|visa]] to enter the US, reportedly due to her family's connections with [[guerrillas]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. M.I.A. instead opted to record the album at a variety of locations around the world, including [[India]], [[Trinidad]], [[Liberia]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Australia]]. \n\nThe album features musical styles including [[dance music]] and makes extensive use of [[South Asia|South Asian]] music such as that of the [[urumi (drum)|urumee]], a drum used in [[gaana]] music native to [[Tamil Nadu]], India. It was mainly written and produced by M.I.A. and [[Switch (house DJ)|Switch]], and features contributions from Timbaland, [[Diplo]], [[Afrikan Boy]] and [[The Wilcannia Mob]]. M.I.A. and Switch relied heavily on [[Logic Pro]], a [[digital audio workstation]] produced by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and were able to capture vocals and background sounds outside the traditional studio environment, using a microphone and a [[Macbook|Macbook Pro.]] \n\n''Kala'' charted in 14 countries and topped the [[Dance/Electronic Albums|''Billboard'' Top Electronic Albums]] chart. It spawned the singles \"[[Bird Flu (song)|Bird Flu]]\", \"[[Boyz (song)|Boyz]]\", \"[[Jimmy (song)|Jimmy]]\" and the global hit single \"[[Paper Planes (M.I.A. song)|Paper Planes]]\". By 2013, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for sales of at least 500,000 copies in the US, and [[Music Canada#Certification awards|Platinum]] in Canada. It received widespread critical acclaim and was ranked as one of the best albums of 2007 by many publications. Since its initial release, it has often been cited among the best albums of the 21st century by critics, and has been ranked by several publications as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\n== Composition and recording ==\n[[File:Switchdj.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Dave \"[[Switch (house DJ)|Switch]]\" Taylor, who co-wrote and co-produced ''Kala'']]\nM.I.A.

The \u201cPrologue\u201d refers to his earlier years of studying and choosing a career path. The \u201cfirst act\u201d peaked in the 1880s when Vrubel was studying at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and then moved to [[Kiev]] to study [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Christian art]]. The \u201csecond act\u201d corresponded to the so-called \u201cMoscow period\u201d that started in 1890 with the painting  \u201c[[The Demon Seated]]\u201d and ended in 1902 with the \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d and the subsequent hospitalization of the artist. The \u201cthird act\u201d lasted from 1903 to 1906 when Vrubel was suffering from his mental illness that gradually undermined his physical and intellectual capabilities. For the last four years of his life, already being blind, Vrubel lived only physically.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=20}}\n\nIn 1880-1890, Vrubel's creative aspirations did not find support of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and art critics. However, many private collectors and patrons were fascinated with his paintings, including famous [[wikt:Maecenas|maecenas]] [[Savva Mamontov]], as well as painters and critics who coalesced around the journal \u201c[[Mir iskusstva]]\u201d. Eventually, Vrubel's works were exhibited at Mir Iskusstva's own art exhibitions and [[Sergei Diaghilev]] retrospectives. At the beginning of the 20th century, Vrubel's art became an organic part of the Russian [[Art Nouveau]]. On November 28, 1905, he was awarded the title of Academician of Painting for his \u201cfame in the artistic field\u201d \u2013 just when Vrubel almost finished his career as an artist. \n\n==Becoming a painter==\n===Origin.

The governor\u2019s daughter Anna later married the second son of Mikhail Antonovich from the first marriage, Alexander, who previously graduated from the [[Cadet Corps]], served in the Tengin Infantry Regiment, participated in the [[Caucasian War|Caucasian]] and [[Crimean War]]s. In 1855, their first child Anna Aleksandrovna (1855-1928) was born. Altogether, they had four children, each of whom was born one after the other.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=7\u201412}}\n\nMikhail Vrubel was born on March 17, 1856. At that time, the Vrubel family lived in [[Omsk]] where Alexander was serving as a desk officer of the [[2nd Steppe Siberian Corps]]. Two other children, Alexander and Ekaterina, were also born in Omsk, however, they died before adolescence. Frequent childbirth and adverse [[Siberia]]n climate significantly weakened Mikhail\u2019s mother's health and in 1859 she died from [[tuberculosis|consumption]]. The future painter was only three years old when his mother died. One of the memories that Mikhail had from that period is how his sick mother lay in bed and cut out for her children \"little people, horses and different fantastic figures\" from paper.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=12\u201413}} Being a weak child from birth, Mikhail started to walk only at the age of three.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=5}}\n\n[[File:I 029.png|thumb|left|The Vrubel family in 1863.

In 1859, he was appointed to serve in  [[Astrakhan]] where he had relatives able to help him with children, but  already in 1861 the family had to relocate to  [[Kharkiv]]. There, little Mikhail quickly learned how to read and developed his interest in book illustrations, especially those from the journal \"[[Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye]]\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=14\u201415}}\n\nIn 1863, Alexander Vrubel got married for the second time to Elizaveta Vessel from Saint Petersburg, who dedicated herself to her husband's children (her own child was born only in 1867). In 1867, the family moved to [[Saratov]] where [[podpolkovnik]] Vrubel took command of the provincial garrison. The Vessel family belonged to [[intelligentsia]] \u2013 a status class of educated people engaged in shaping the culture and politics of their society. Elizaveta\u2019s sister Alexandra Vessel graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] and largely contributed to the introducing Mikhail to the world of music. Elizaveta herself spent a lot of time on improving Mikhail\u2019s health; later he even ironically recalled that she made him follow  the \"diet of raw meat and fish oil\". However, there is no doubt that he owes his physical strength to the regime maintained by his stepmother.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=16\u201418}} In addition, Elizaveta's brother, professional teacher {{ill|Nicolai Vessel|ru|\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, also participated in children's education by introducing educational games and home entertainments. Despite the generally good relationships among all the relatives, Anna and Mikhail kept a little aloof from them. Sometimes they behaved coldly to their stepmother calling her with an ironic nickname \"Madrin'ka \u2014 perl materei\". They also explicitly expressed their desire to start an independent life outside home thus making their father upset.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=20\u201422}} By the age of 10, Mikhail expressed artistic talents through drawing, theater and music practicing; that altogether occupied in his future life no less place than painting. According to Dmitrieva, \"the boy was like a boy, gifted, but rather promising a versatile amateur than an obsessed artist, whom he later became\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0441 \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|Vrubel with his sister Anna.

At that time, a copy of \"[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The last Judgement]]\" by [[Michelangelo]] was exhibited in Saratov. The painting impressed Mikhail so much, that, according to his sister, he reproduced it from his memory in all details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=28}}\n\n===Gymnasium===\n\nMikhail Vrubel started his education at the {{ill|Fifth St. Petersburg Gymnasium|ru|\u041f\u044f\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f}} where the school directorate paid particular attention to the modernization of teaching methods, the advancement of [[Classics|classical studies]], the literary development of high school students, dance and gymnastics lessons. His father Alexander was also in Saint Petersburg, voluntarily attending lectures at the [[Alexander Military Law Academy]] as an auditor. In addition to his studies at the gymnasium, Mikhail attended painting classes at the school of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]]. However, he was most interested in natural sciences thanks to his teacher Nicolai Peskov who was a political exile. In 1870, after living three years in Saint Petersburg , the Vrubel family moved to [[Odessa]] where Alexander was appointed as a judge in the garrison court.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=30\u201431}}\n\nIn Odessa, Mikhail studied at the [[Richelieu Lyceum]]. Several letters from him to his sister Anna who was  receiving teacher education in Saint Petersburg have been preserved. The first letter dated October 1872; both letters are large and easy to read, with many quotes in French and [[Latin]]. In these letters, Mikhail mentioned the paintings that he made \u2013 the portrait of his smaller brother Alexander who died in 1869 (reproduced from the photograph), and the portrait of Anna hanging in the father's office. However, comparing to other interests that Mikhail had, painting classes did not occupy much of his time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=5\u20147}}{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=33\u201434}} Vrubel was a quick learner and was the first in his class. He had a special interest in literature, languages, history, and, on vacations,  he loved to read to his sister in original Latin. The future painter devoted even his free time to favourite activities. For instance, in one of his letters, he complained to Anna that instead of reading [[Goethe's Faust]] in original and completing  50 exercises in English textbook, he copied in oil \"Sunset at Sea\" by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}} At the same time, one might say that at that time Mikhail was more interested in theatrical art rather than painting, since he barely mentioned the \"[[Peredvizhniki]]\" exhibition in Odessa but spent several pages describing the Saint Petersburg opera troupe.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}}\n\n===University===\n[[File:Anna Karenina Wrubel.jpg|thumb|right|The date of Anna Karenina with the son, 1878]]\n\nAfter graduating with a distinction, neither Vrubel nor his parents thought of his career as an artist. It was decided to send Mikhail to Saint Petersburg where he could study at the  [[Saint Petersburg State University]] and live with his uncle Nicolai Vessel, who would also cover Vrubel\u2019s everyday expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}} Mikhail\u2019s decision to study  at the [[Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] was differently interpreted by Vrubel\u2019s biographers. For example, [[Alexandre Benois]], who studied at the same faculty, suggested that the rationale behind this decision was the family tradition and values that legal profession had among their social circles. In 1876, Vrubel had to repeat the second year due to poor grades and a desire to strengthen his knowledge on the subjects. However, even though Mikhail studied for a year more than was expected, he could not defend his thesis and graduated in the rank of \"{{ill|deistvitel'nyi student|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442}}\" which was the lowest scientific degree that one can graduate with.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=41}} Despite deep engagement with philosophy and, particularly, the theory of aesthetics by [[Immanuel Kant]], Mikhail\u2019s s [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle that his uncle allowed him to maintain was partly to blame for not finishing the university. At that time, Vrubel did not spend much time on practicing painting,{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=48\u201450}} though he made several illustrations for literary works  both classic and contemporary. According to Dmitrieva, \"in general\u2026 Vrubel's art is thoroughly \"literary\": a rare work of his does not originate in a literary or  theatrical source\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=18}} One of the most famous compositions from that period is \"The date of [[Anna Karenina]] with the son\". According to Domitieva, this was his \"pre-Vrubel\" stage since the painting mostly reminds of journal illustrations of that time: \"utterly romantic, even melodramatic, and very carefully decorated\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=50\u201452}} Active participation in theatrical life (Vrubel personally knew [[Modest Mussorgsky]] who frequently visited the Vessel's house) required considerable expenses which is why Vrubel regularly worked as a tutor and a [[governess]]. In 1875, he even travelled to Europe with one of his pupils; together, they visited [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]]. In addition, Mikhail spent the summer of 1875 at the estate belonged to a Russian lawyer {{ill|Dmitrii Berr|ru|\u0411\u0435\u0440, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (His wife Yulia Berr was a niece of [[Mikhail Glinka]]). Then, due to the excellent knowledge of Latin, Vrubel was hired as a tutor at the Papmel family where he guided his former university classmate.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=57\u201459}} According to the memoirs of A. I. Ivanov:\n\n{{Quote|Vrubel lived with the Papmel family as a relative: in the winter he went to the opera with them, in the summer he moved with everyone to their cottage in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]]. Papmels put on quite a spread and everything about them was opposite to the way the Vrubel family lived; their house was a full bowl, even in an excessively literal sense, and during his time with Papmels, Vrubel firstly discovered his passion for wine which was never been lacking.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=61}}}}\n\nIt was the Papmel family prone to [[aestheticism]] and bohemian lifestyle that encouraged Vrubel's [[dandy]]ism and a desire to paint. In one of his letters from 1879, Vrubel mentioned that he renewed his acquaintance with a Russian watercolourist Emilie Villiers, who in every possible way patronized Mikhail' pictorial experiences in Odessa. Later, Vrubel began to communicate closely with students of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] who worked under the patronage of a famous Russian painter [[Pavel Chistyakov]]. Vrubel started attending evening academic classes where auditioning was allowed, and started to hone plastic skills.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=63\u201464}} As a result, at the age of 24, Vrubel had a crucial turning point in his life \u2013 after graduating from the university and serving a short military service, Vrubel was admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n==The 1880s==\n===The Academy of Arts===\n[[File:Serov Chistyakov.jpg|thumb|left|The portrait of Chistyakov by [[Valentin Serov]], 1881]]\n\nAccording to Domiteeva, Vrubel's decision to study at the Academy of Arts came from his engagement with the Kant's theory of aesthetic ideas. His younger colleague and an admirer {{ill|Stepan Yaremich|ru|\u042f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447, \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} suggested that Vrubel adopted Kant's philosophy that \"clarity of the division between physical and moral life\" led over time to a separation of these areas in the real life. Mikhail Vrubel demonstrated \"softness, pliability, shyness in little things in everyday life; while iron perseverance accompanied his general higher direction of life\". However, this was only one side of the story \u2013 undoubtedly, at the age of 24, Vrubel considered himself as a genius. According to the Kant's theory of aesthetics, the  \u201cgenius\u201d category  implied working in a sphere \u201cbetween freedom and nature\u201d that could only be achieved in the field of arts. For a young and gifted Vrubel that inspired his long-term life plan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=66\u201467}}\n\nStarting from the autumn of 1880, Vrubel audited classes in the Academy and, presumably, started having private lessons at the [[Pavel Chistyakov|Chistyakov's]] studio. However, these lessons were documented only starting from 1882; the painter himself claimed that he studied with Chistyakov for four years. In his autobiography dated 1901, the painter characterized years spent in the Academy as \"the brightest in his artistic career\" thanks to Chistyakov. This does not contradict what he wrote to his sister in 1883 (when they renewed mutual correspondence that was broken off for six years):\n\n{{Quote|When I started my lessons with Chistyakov, I passionately followed his main statements because they were nothing less than a formula of my living attitude towards nature, that is embedded in me.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=21}}}}\n\nAmong Chistyakov\u2019s students there were  [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], and [[Valentin Serov]] all of whom painted in different styles. All of them, including Vrubel, recognized Chistyakov as their only teacher, honouring him to the last days. Due to scepticism prevailed among the second generation of scholars, this type of relationship between the mentor and his students was not quite appreciated. Chistyakov's method was purely [[Academic Art|academic]], but very \u201cindividualistic\u201d since Pavel inspired \"sacred concepts\" in working on a plastic form, but also taught conscious drawing as well as structural analysis of the form. According to Chistyakov, in order to construct the painting one needs to break it down to several small planes transmitted by flatnesses, and these planes would form the faces of the volume with its hollows and bulges. Vrubel's  \"crystal-like\" technique was thus fully mastered by his teacher.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=22\u201423}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041f\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0438\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Feasting Romans, 1883]]\nOne of the most crucial acquaintances that Vrubel met during his time in the Academy was [[Valentin Serov]]. Despite a 10-year age difference, they were connected on different levels, including the deepest one.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=72\u201474}} Throughout the years spent at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel's motives drastically changed: his dandyism was replaced with [[asceticism]], about which he proudly wrote to his sister.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=81}} Starting from 1881,  after transferring to a life model class, Mikhail visited both Chistyakov's classes and morning watercolour lessons at the Repin's studio. However, their relationship with Repin got complicated quickly due to the argument on the painting \"[[Religious Procession in Kursk Governorate]]\". In one of the letters to his sister, Vrubel mentioned that by \"taking advantage of the [public] ignorance, Repin stole that special pleasure that distinguishes the state of mind before a work of art from the state of mind before the expanded printed sheet\". This quote clearly illustrates Chistyakov's influence on Vrubel\u2019s philosophy since Pavel was the one who suggested that obedience of techniques to art is the fundamental spiritual property of the Russian creativity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=84\u201485}}\n\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0449\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0420\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430.jpg|thumb|left|Model in a Renaissance setting]] \nOne of the brightest examples of Vrubel's academic work is his sketch \"Feasting Romans\". Even though it formally compiled with rules of academic art, the painting violates all  the main canons of academism \u2013  the composition does not have the main focus, the plot is unclear.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=28}}\n\nJudging by the correspondence between Vrubel and his sister, the painter spent almost two years on the painting. The plot was simple: a cupbearer and  a young [[citharode]] wink to each other sitting nearby the sleeping [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]. The view was quite whimsical \u2013 from somewhere on the balcony or a high window. It implied a dim lighting \"after sunset, without any reflections of light\" for strengthening the silhouette effects. Vrubel's intention was to make \"some similarities with [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]\". The final watercolour sketch grew with sub-stickers and caused Repin\u2019s enthusiasm. However, Vrubel felt intuitively the limit of unsteady forms and eventually abandoned the unfinished paintings refusing to paint a historical picture.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=104\u2014106}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c - \u0413\u0430\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u041e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f (1884).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hamlet and Ophelia, 1884]]\nHowever, Vrubel did not abandon his idea to get paid for his creative work. Thanks to the Papmel family, he received a commission from the industrialist {{ill|Leopold Koenig|ru|\u041a\u0451\u043d\u0438\u0433, \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0434 \u0415\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. According to the mutual agreement,  the subject and technique of the painting would be left at the discretion of the artist and the fee would be 200 rubles. Mikhail also decided to participate in the contest initiated by the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] and chose the plot of \"[[Hamlet]] and [[Ophelia]]\" in the style of [[Madonna of Loreto| Rafael's realism]]. The self-portrait sketches of Hamlet and watercolors for the general composition which depict the Danish prince as represented by Vrubel have been preserved.  However, the work on the painting was complicated with worsening relationship between the painter and his father.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=106\u2014108}} Having failed with the \"Hamlet\" as well, Vrubel was persuaded by his friends to depict a real life model. For this role, they chose an experienced model Agafya who was put in the same chair that served as decorations for the \u201cHamlet\u201d, while student {{ill|Vladimir Derviz|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0437, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} brought some [[Florence|Florentine]] [[velvet]], [[Venice|Venetian]] brocade and other things from the [[Renaissance]] period from his parents house.  Vrubel successfully finished the painting  \"Sitter in the Renaissance Setting\" with characteristic for Vrubel \u201cpainting embossing\u201d . Under the impression from the \"Sitter\", Vrubel returned to \"Hamlet\". This time he painted with oil on a canvas with Serov as a model.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=108\u2014110}}\n\nDespite the formal success, Vrubel was not able to graduate from the Academy. However, in 1883, his painting \"Betrothal of Mary and Joseph\" received the silver medal from the Academy. Following the recommendation of Chistyakov, in the autumn of 1883, professor [[Adrian Prakhov]] invited Vrubel to [[Kiev]] to work on a restoration of the 12th century [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's Monastery]]. The offer was flattering and promised good earnings therefore the artist agreed to go after the end of the academic year.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=111}}\n\n===Kiev===\n[[File:Vrubel Self Portrait 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait, 1885]]\n\nThe years that Vrubel spent in Kiev turned out to be almost the most important in his career. For the first time in Vrubel\u2019s life, the painter was able to pursue his monumental intentions and return to the fundamentals of the Russian art. In five years, Mikhail completed an enormous amount of paintings. For instance, he single-handedly painted murals and icons for the  [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's church]], as well as made 150 drawings for the restoration the figure of an angel in the dome of the St. Sophia Cathedral. As Dmitrieva noted:\n{{Quote|Such a \"co-authorship\" with the masters of the 12th century was unknown to any of the great artists of the 19th century. The 1880s have just only passed, the first search for national antiquity just started, which no one else besides specialists was interested in, and even those specialists were interested more from the historical point rather than artistic <\u2026> Vrubel in Kiev was the first who bridged archaeological pioneering and restorations to a live contemporary art. At the same time, he did not think of stylization. He felt like an accomplice in the hard work of the ancient masters and tried to be worthy of them.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=34}}}}\n\nPrakhov\u2019s invitation was almost coincidental, as he was looking for a qualified painter with some academic training to paint murals in the church, but at the same time not to be recognised enough so he would not require a higher salary.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=113}} Judging from the correspondence with the family, Vrubel's contract with Prakhov was for the completion of four icons in the duration of 76 days.

Lev Kovalsky, who in 1884 was a student at the  Kiev Art School appointed to pick Mikhail up in the station, later recalled:\n{{Quote|... Against a background of primitive Kirillovsky hills, a blond, almost white, young man with a particular head and small, almost white, moustaches, stood behind my back. He was of a moderate height, very proportionate, wearing\u2026 it stroke me the most\u2026black velvet costume with stockings, short trousers and anklets. <...> In general, he was impersonating a young Venetian from the paintings of [[Tintoretto]] or [[Titian]]; however, I found out about it only many years later when I visited Venice.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=13}}}}\n\n[[File:Mikhail-Vrubel-Icon3-(fragment).png|thumb|150px|right|\u201c{{ill|Virgin and Child|ru|Madonna (\u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0441 \u043c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0435\u043c)}}\u201d (fragment)]] \n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - Womans Head (1885).png|left|150px|thumb|Woman\u2019s Head (Emily Prakhova)]]\nThe [[fresco]] \"Descent of Holy Spirit on the Apostles\" that Vrubel painted on the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of the St. Cyril's church bridged both features of Byzantine art and his own portrait pursuits. The fresco reflected most of the Vrubel's characteristic features and depicted twelve Apostles that are situated in a semicircle at the box vault of the choirs. The standing figure of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is located in the center of the composition. The background is coloured in blue while the golden rays are coming up to the apostles from the circle featuring the [[Holy Spirit]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=34}} The model for the Mary\u2019s figure was a paramedic M. Ershova \u2013 a frequent guest in the Prakhov's house and the future wife of one of the painters participating in the restoration process.  To Mary\u2019s left stands the apostle that was painted from [[protoiereus]] Petr (Lebedintsev) who at that time taught at the Richelieu lyceum. To Mary's right stands the second apostle for whom the Kiev archaeologist {{ill|Viktor Goshkevich|ru|\u0413\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447, \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} was modelling. The third from the right was the head of the Kirillovsky parish Peter Orlovsky who originally discovered the remains of old paintings and interested the [[Imperial Russian Archaeological Society]] in their reconstruction. The fourth apostle, folded his hands in a prayer, was Prakhov. Besides the \"Descent\", Vrubel painted the \"The entry into Jerusalem\" and \"The Angels\u2019Lamentation\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=124}} The \"Descent\" was painted directly on the wall, without any cardboard and even any preliminary sketches \u2013 only certain details were previously specified on small sheets of paper. Remarkably, the painting depicts Apostles in a semicircle with their [[Halo (religious iconography)|limbs]] connecting to the Holy Spirit emblem. This painting style was of Byzantine origin and was inspired with hammered [[winged altarpiece]] from one of the [[\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438|Tiflis]] monasteries.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=123\u2014125}}\n\n===The first trip to Italy===\n[[File:Vrubel Moses.jpg|thumb|right|Icon of the Prophet Moses]]\nVrubel travelled to Venice together with Samuel Gaiduk who was a young artist painting in accordance with Mikhail's sketches.  Their trip had been not without some \u201cadventures\u201d, however. According to Prakhov, Vrubel met his friend from St. Petersburg with whom they went out partying during the transfer in [[Vienna]]. Gaiduk, who successfully reached Venice,  waited two days for Vrubel to arrive. Life in Venice in winter was cheap, and painters shared a studio in the city centre on Via San Maurizio. They both were interested in churches on the abandoned island [[Torcello]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=134\u2014135}}\n\nDmitrieva described Vrubel's artistic evolution as following: \"Neither [[Titian]] and [[Paolo Veronese]], nor magnificent [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] atmosphere of the Venetian [[Cinquecento]] attracted him. The range of his Venetian addictions is clearly defined: from medieval mosaics and stained glass of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] and [[Torcello Cathedral]] to painters of the early Renaissance [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Cima da Conegliano]] (the figures of which Vrubel found especially noble), [[Giovanni Bellini]]. <...> If the first meeting with Byzantine-Russian art in Kiev enriched Vrubel's envisioning of plastic forms, then Venice enriched his palette and awakened his gift as a colourist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=37\u201438}}\"\n\nThese features can be clearly observed in all the three icons that Vrubel painted in Venice for the St. Cyril's Church \u2013 \"Saint Kirill\", \"Saint Afanasii\", and gloomy-coloured \"Christ the Savior\". Being accustomed to intensive work at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel painted all four icons in a month and a half and felt a crave for activities and the lack of communication. In Venice, he accidentally met [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] who was married to one of the Chistyakov' students. Together they discussed how to preserve paintings in the condition of high humidity as well as argued on the advantages of writing in oil on [[zinc]] boards before painting on a canvas. The zinc boards for Vrubel' icons were delivered directly from Kiev; however, for a long time painter could not establish his own techniques and the paint could not stick to the metal. In April, Vrubel only wanted to come back to Russia.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=140,148\u2014149}}\n\n===Kiev and Odessa===\n[[File:Vrubel Angel.jpg|thumb|right|Angel with censer and candle. Fresco sketch for the Vladimir Cathedral, 1887]]\nAfter returning from Venice in 1885, Vrubel spent May and part of June in Kiev. There were rumours that immediately after he came back, he proposed to Emily Prakhova despite her being a married woman. According to one version of the story, Vrubel proclaimed his decision not to Emily but to her husband Adrian Prakhov. Even though Mikhail Vrubel was not denied access to the house, Prakhov was definitely \"afraid of him\" while Emily resented his immaturity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=150}} Apparently, the incident described a year later by Vrubel\u2019s friend [[Konstantin Korovin]] belongs to this period:\n{{Quote|It was a hot summer. We went swimming at the big lake in the garden. <...> \"What are these big white strips at your chest that look like scars?\" \u2013\" Yes, these are scars. I cut myself with a knife.\" <...> \"... But still tell me, Mikhail Alexandrovich, why did you cut yourself \u2013 it must be painful.

Edwards, together with [[Kyriak Kostandi]], tried to reform the Odessa Art School and decided to decided to elicit Vrubel's help. He settled Vrubel in his own house and tried to persuade him to stay in Odessa forever.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=151\u2014153}} In summer, Serov arrived in Odessa and Vrubel for the first time told him about his plan to paint the \"[[Demon (poem)|Demon]]\". In letters to his family, Vrubel also mentioned a [[tetralogy]] that probably became one of his side interests. In 1886 Vrobel went to Kiev to celebrate the new year using the money that his father sent him for a trip home (at that time the family resided in Kharkiv).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=162\u2014163}}\n\nIn Kiev, Vrubel met frequently with associates of writer [[Ieronim Yasinsky]]. He also met Korovin for the first time. Despite the intensive work, the painter led a \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle and became a regular in the [[caf\u00e9-chantant]] \u00abShato-de-fler\u00bb. This depleted his meager salary and the main source of income became the sugar manufacturer [[Ivan Tereshchenko]] who immediately gave the painter 300 rubles toward the expenses of his planned \"Oriental Tale\". Vrubel used to throw his money in the caf\u00e9-\u0441hantant.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=174\u2014177}}\n\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0447.jpg|thumb|left|Tombstone Crying, the second version. Akvarel, 1887. Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\nAt the same time, Adrian Prakhov organized painting of the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]] and, without regard to his personal attitudes, invited Vrubel. Despite Vrubel's carelessness towards his works inspired with his \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle, he created no less than six versions of the \"Tombstone Crying\" (only four of them have been preserved). The story is not included in the [[Gospel]] and not usual for the [[Russian icons|Russian Orthodox]] art, but can be seen in some icons from the Italian Renaissance. Though he clearly understood their significance and originality, Prakhov rejected Vrubel's independent paintings since they differed significantly from the works of other participating colleagues and would have unbalanced the relative integrity of the already-assembled murals.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=10}} Prakhov once noted that the a new cathedral \"in a very special style\" would need to be built to accommodate Vrubel' paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=44}}\n\nIn addition to commissioned works, Vrubel attempted to paint \"Praying for the cup\" just \"for himself\". However, he experienced a severe mental crisis while trying to finish it. He wrote to his sister:\n{{Quote|I draw and paint Christ with all my might, but, at the same time, presumably, because I am far away from my family, all religious rituals, including [[Resurrection of Jesus]] look so alien, that I am even annoyed with it.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=48}}}}\n\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - The Girl Against the Background of Persian Carpet.png|thumb|right|Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet, 1886. Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\nWhile painting murals in the Kiev churches, Vrubel simultaneously was drawn to the image of the Demon. According to P. Klimov, it was quite logical and even natural for Vrubel to transfer techniques acquired during the painting of sacred images to completely opposite images, and it illustrates the direction of his pursuits.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=11}} His father Alexander visited him in Kiev when Mikhail had some intense mental struggles.

He even noted that this painting would be unlikely to connect with either the public or with representatives of the Academy of art.  As a result, Mikhail destroyed the painting, and many other works that he created in Kiev.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=179}} To earn a living, the painter started to paint the already promised \"Oriental Tail\", but could only finish a watercolour. He tried to give it to Emily Prakhova as a gift; and tore it up after she rejected it.  But then he reconsidered and glued together the pieces of the destroyed work. The only finished painting from this period was the \"Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet\" depicting Mani Dakhnovich, the daughter of the loan office owner. Dmitrieva defined the genre of this painting as a \u201cportrait-fantasy\u201d. The customer, though, did not like the final version, and the work was later bought by Tereshchenko.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=20\u201423}}\n\nThe painter's mental crisis is clear in the following incident. On a visit to Prakhov, where a group of artists were participating in the painting of the cathedral, Vrubel proclaimed that his father died and so he needed urgently to travel to Kharkiv.

As a result, Vrubel settled at the Korovin\u2019s studio on the {{ill|Dolgorukovskaya street|ru|\u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430}}.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=193\u2014194}} Vrubel, Korovin and Serov even had an idea to share a studio but, however, it did not translate into reality due to deteriorating relations with Serov.

Altogether, there were 18 painters, including Ilya Repin, [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], [[Leonid Pasternak]], [[Apollinary Vasnetsov]]. Of these, Vrubel was the only one who was completely unknown to the public.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=225}} It is not known who drew the the publishers' attention to Vrubel.

Due to their complexity, his paintings were hard to reproduce and Vrubel had to amend them. The main difficulty, however, was that his colleagues did not understand Vrubel's art. In spite of this, the illustrated publication was approved by the [[Censorship in the Russian Empire|censorship authorities]] on April 10, 1891. Immediately thereafter the publication was widely discussed in the press who harshly criticized illustrations for their \"rudeness, ugliness, caricature, and absurdity\" (it is interesting that in 20 years critics will argue that it was Vrubel who was able to \"translate into a new language\" the poetic essence of Lermontov's spirit).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=231\u2014232}} Even people who were well-disposed to Vrubel did not understand him. So the painter changed his views on aesthetics suggesting that the \"true art\" is incomprehensible to almost anyone, and \"comprehensibility\" was as suspicious for him as \"incomprehensibility\" was for others.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=62}}\n\nVrubel made all his illustrations in black watercolour; monochromaticity made it possible to emphasize the dramatic nature of the subject and made it possible to show the range of textured pursuits explored by the artist. The Demon was an archetypal \"fallen angel\" who simultaneously bridged men and female figures. Tamara was differently depicted on every image, and that emphasized her unavoidable choice between earthly and heavenly.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=14}} According to Dmitrieva, Vrubel\u2019s illustrations show the painter to be at the peak of his ability as a graphic artist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=37}}\n\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d (\u0441\u0438\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Demon Seated, 1890.

He became so fond of the local landscapes that decided to stay in there. In Abramtsevo, Vrubel became fascinated with [[ceramic]]s and soon after that he proudly mentioned to his sister Anna that he now heads the \"factory of ceramic tiles and [[terracotta]] decorations\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=253, 246}} Savva Mamontov did not understand Vrubel' aesthetic aspirations but recognized his talent, and was trying his best to create a suitable living environment for the painter. For the first time in his life, Vrubel ceased to depend noble families for his support and started earning good money by completing several  several ceramic commissions; decorating a majolica chapel on the grave of A. Mamontov; projecting the extension in the \"Roman-Byzantine style\" to the Mamontov's mansion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=245\u2014246}} According to Dmitrieva, \"Vrubel\u2026 seemed to be irreplaceable as he could easily do any art, except writing texts.

However, both of these studies differed in the aspects of art. For instance, Mamontov mostly concentrated on theatrical and architecture projects while Tenisheva focused on Russian national traditions.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=199}}   Ceramics of the Abramtsevo Potter's Factory played a significant role in the revival of maiolica in Russia. Vrubel was attracted to it because of maiolica's simplicity, spontaneity, and its rough texture and whimsical spills of glaze. Ceramics allowed Vrubel to experiment freely with plastic and artistic possibilities of the material. The lack of craftsmanship with its patterns allowed to put his fantasies into life.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=203}} In Abramtsevo, Vrubel' plans were supported and brought to life by the famous ceramist [[Peter Vaulin]].{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=209}}\n\n===The return trip to Italy===\nIn 1891, the Mamontov family went to Italy. They planned travel itineraries around the interests of Abramtsevo pottery studio. Vrubel accompanied the family as a consultant which led to a conflict between him and Mamontov's wife, Elizaveta. Thus, Mamontov and Vrubel went to [[Milan]] where Vrubel\u2019s sister Elizaveta (Liliia) was studying.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=263}} It was suggested that the painter would spend winter in [[Rome]] where he might finish the Mamontov's order \u2013 decorations for \"[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]\" and design the new curtain for the [[Private Opera]]. Savva Mamontov paid Vrubel a monthly salary; however, an attempt to settle him in the Mamontov's house led to a scandal with Elizaveta after which Vrubel decided to stay with Svedomsky.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=264}}\n\nVrubel did not get along with other Russian artists working in Rome and continuously accused them with the lack of artistic talent, plagiarism, and other things. He was much closer to brothers Alexander and Pavel Svedomsky with whom he regularly visited variete \"Apollon\" and cafe \"Aran'o\". He also enjoyed their studio which was rebuilt from the former greenhouse. It had glass walls and the Roman ceiling which made it very hard to stay there in winter due to cold.  Svedomskys unconditionally recognized Vrubel's creative superiority and not only settled him at their house but also shared commercial orders with him.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=264\u2014266}} In the end, Mamontov arranged Vrubel's stay at the studio of half Italian [[Alexander Rizzoni]] who graduated from the Russian Academy of Arts. Vrubel highly respected him and willingly worked under the Rizzoni's supervision. The main reason for this was that Rizzoni considered himself as not entitled to interfere in the painter's personal style, but was picky about diligence. Vrubel subsequently wrote that \"I have not heard from many people so much fair but benevolent criticism\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=267}}\n\nIn winter 1892, Vrubel decided to participate in the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] where he got an idea for the painting \"Snow-maiden\" (not preserved). Elizaveta Mamontova later wrote:\n{{Quote|I visited Vrubel, he painted a life-size Snow Maiden's head in watercolour against the background of a pine tree covered with snow.

The main feature of this composition is its timelessness \u2013 it is impossible to say when the action took place.

The painter combined painting with architecture, sculpture and applied art. Karpova recognized his leading role in creating ensembles of Moscow Modern.

According to the Korovin\u2019s memoirs, after getting a large salary for watercolour panels, he spent them as follows:\n{{quote|He organized the dinner in the hotel \"Paris\" where he also lived.

Savva Mamontov was a curator of the exposition dedicated to the [[Far North (Russia)|Russian North]]. It was him who noticed that the neighbouring section of arts lacks the paintings that would cover two large empty walls. Mamontov discussed with the Minister of Finance his idea to cover these walls with large panels with total area 20 \u00d7 5 m and ordered these panels from Vrubel.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=297}} At that time, the painter was busy decorating the Morozov's mansion in Moscow.

For the second wall, Vrubel chose \"The Princess of the Dream\" inspired by a work of the same name made by the French poet [[Edmond Rostand]]. The second painting symbolically represented the painter's dream of beauty.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=60}}\n\nIt was impossible to complete the order in such short notice. That is why Vrubel instructed painter T. Safonov from Nizhny Novgorod to start working on \"Mikula\". Safonov was supposed to paint according to Vrubel's sketches. The decorative frieze was finished by A.

The committee included [[Vladimir Aleksandrovich Beklemishev]], [[Konstantin Savitsky]], [[Pavel Brullov]], and others. They concluded that it is impossible to exhibit Vrubel's works. Mamontov told Vrubel to continue working and went to Saint Petersburg to persuade the members of the committee. At the same time, while trying to put the plot of \"Mikula Selyaninovich\" on a canvas , Vrubel realized that he previously was not able to proportionate the figures properly. Thus he started to paint the new version right on the stage of the pavilion. Mamontov attempted to protect the painter and called for the convening of the new committee. However, his claims were rejected, and on May 22 Vrubel had to leave the exhibition hall while all of his works had been already taken.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=304\u2014305}}\n\nVrubel lost nothing financially since Mamontov bought both paintings for {{nobr|5 000}} rubles each. He also agreed with [[Vasily Polenov]] and Konstantin Korovin for them finishing the half-ready \"Mikula\". Canvases were rolled up and brought back to Moscow where Polenov and Korovin started working on them while Vrubel was finishing \"The Princess of the Dream\" in a shed of the Abramtsevo Pottery factory. Both canvases arrived in Nizhny Novgorod right before the emperor's visit scheduled on July 15-17.

On the contrary, Maxim Gorky was against Vrubel. He made fun of \"Mikula\" by comparing it with a fictional character Chernomor. \"The Princess of the Dream\" resent him with its \"antics, ugliness of otherwise beautiful plot\".

Stored at the [[Russian Museum]]]]\nTen years later, Vrubel returned to the theme of Demon which is evident from his correspondence with [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] at the end of 1898. Starting from the next year, the painter was torn between the paintings \u201c{{ill|Flying Demon|ru|\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439}}\u201d and \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d. As a result, he chose the first variant, but the painting remained unfinished. The painting and several illustrations were inspired by intertwined plots of Lermontov\u2019s Demon and Pushkin\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet\u201d.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=17}} \n\n[[File:Wrubel-Portrait of Son-1902.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of the painter\u2019s son, 1902.

The baby boy was born strong with well-developed muscles but had an [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|orofacial cleft]]. Nadezhda\u2019s sister, Ekaterina Ge, suggested that Mikhail had \u201ca particular taste hence he could find beauty in a certain irregularity. And this child, despite his lip, was so cute with his big blue eyes that his lip shocked people only in the first moment and then everyone would forget about it\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}\nWhile working on \u201cDemon\u201d, the painter created the large watercolour portrait of a six-month child sitting in a baby carriage. As [[Nikolai Tarabukin]] later recalled:\n{{Quote|The scared and mournful face of this tiny creature flashed like a meteor in this world and was full of unusual expressiveness and some childish wisdom. His eyes, as if prophetically, captured the whole tragic fate of his fragility.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}}}\n\nThe birth of Savva led to a dramatic change in the routine of the family. Nadezhda Vruble decided to take a break in her career and refused to hire a nanny. Hence, Mikhail Vrubel had to support his family. Starting from September-October 1901, Vrubel had experienced first depression symptoms due to drastically increased number of working hours. Starting from November, he stopped working on \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d. Vrubel\u2019s biographer later wrote:\n{{Quote|For the whole winter Vrubel worked very intensively. Despite usual 3-4 hours, he worked up to 14 hours, and sometimes even more, with a flash of artificial lightning, never leaving the room and barely coming off the painting. Once a day he put up a coat, opened window leaf and inhaled some cold air \u2013 and called it his \u201cpromenade\u201d. Fully engaged in work, he became intolerant to any disturbance, did not want to see any guests and barely talked to the family. The ''Demon'' was many times almost finished, but Vrubel re-painted it over and over again.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=397}}}}\n{{wide image|Vrubel Fallen Demon.jpg|500px|''Demon Downcast'', 1902.

It is unusually spectacular, and was, even more, striking upon its creation when the pink crown sparkled, the peacock feathers flickered and shimmered (after a few years, the dazzling colours began to darken, dry up and now almost blackened). This exaggerated decorative effect itself deprives the painting of actual depth. To amaze and shock, the artist, who had already lost his emotional balance, betrayed his \u201ccult of a deep nature\u201d - and ''The Demon Dawncast'', from the purely formal side, more than any other paintings by Vrubel, was painted in the modern style\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=79}}\n\nVrubel\u2019s mental health continued to worsen. He started suffering from insomnia, from day to day, his anxiety increased, and the painter became unusually self-confident and verbose. On February 2, 1902, unsuccessful exposition of \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d in Moscow (the painter hoped that the painting would be bought for the Tretyakov Gallery) coincided with a suicide of [[Alexander Rizzoni]] following incorrect criticism in the \u201cMir isskusstva\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=408\u2014410}}\n\nThen the painting was brought to Saint Petersburg where Vrubel continued to constantly re-paint it. However, according to his friends, he only damaged it. Due to the painter\u2019s anxiety, his friends brought him to a famous psychiatrist [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] who diagnosed Vrubel with an ''incurable, progressive paralysis'' or [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]]. Mikhail Vrubel travelled to Moscow without knowing the diagnosis where his condition only worsened.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=412}} His painting was bought for 3 000 rubles by the famous collector {{ill|Vladimir von Meck|ru|\u0424\u043e\u043d \u041c\u0435\u043a\u043a, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. Judging by the correspondence between Nadezhda Zabela and Rimsky-Korsakov, Vrubel ''got crazy'', drank a lot, wasted money and quickly broke off for any reason. His wife and son tried to escape him and ran to relatives in Ryazan, but he followed them. At the beginning of April, Vrubel was hospitalized to a private hospital run by Savvy Magilevich.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=413}}\n\n== Disease. Dying (1903-1910) ==\n\n===The first crisis===\nVrubel\u2019s madness attracted the attention of the press; however, the reviews were mostly negative. For example, the newspaper ''Russian leaflet'' published the article \u201cMental Decadents\u201d that led to the official statement of denying. Soon, the established painters started to publish articles where they claimed that ''The Demon Downcast'' ''has something that needs to be in every true artistic composition''.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=414}} [[Alexandre Benois]] also changed his opinion on Vrubel\u2019 paintings; he even added an emotional passage about the ''true poetic nature''of Vrubel\u2019s paintings to his book \u201cHistory of Russian XIX century Art\u201d.{{sfn|\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430|1999|p=409}} Then, Benois and Diaghilev decided to prove Vrubel\u2019s sanity to the public, and in 1902 organized the exhibition of 36 works, including all three of his \u201cDemons\u201d. This exhibition was a tipping point in defining public attitudes to Vrubel\u2019s art; however, not many believed in his potential recovery. Authors of the articles in \u201cMir Isskustva\u201d even wrote about Vrubel in the past tense as if they had already summed up his artistic career.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}}\n\nFrom April to August 1902, Vrubel\u2019s mental health was indeed so bad that even his sister and wife were not allowed to visit him. He was wild and needed constant supervision. In the moments when the disease receded, he was able to speak coherently and attempted to paint. However, all his drawings from this period presented \u201cprimitive pornography\u201d. Additionally, his [[grandiose delusions]] also strengthened. One of the main symptoms of his disease was a constant desire to tore the cloth and underwear apart. In September 1902, Vrubel\u2019s condition had improved somewhat, and he even stopped bugging and drawing pornography became polite. Thus, it was decided to transfer him to the [[Serbsky Center]] at the Moscow University run by [[Vladimir Serbsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=414\u2014415}} In the clinic, Vrubel\u2019s health generally improved even though his family was still prohibited from visiting. The painter started writing to his wife, mostly in a self-deprecating tone. Serbsky confirmed the diagnosis \u201cprogressive paralysis due to syphilitic infection\u201d of Vladimir Bekhterev and even found out that the contamination took place in 1892. After Vrubel was prescribed with mercury drugs and sedatives, his behaviour became more predictable. Mikhail started to receive guests, including Vladimir von Meck and [[Pyotr Konchalovsky]]. However, the painter avoided conversations about art and was constantly gloomy. The only expected outcome was physical and mental [[wikt:degradation|degradation]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=418\u2014419}}\n\n=== Death of son. The second crisis ===\n[[File:Six-winged Seraph (Azrael). 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Six-winged Seraph, 1904. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nIn February 1903, Vrubel was discharged from the clinic. He was lethargic and absent-minded, all attempts to paint led to nothing. Doctors advised to send him to [[Crimea]], however, by April, his [[apathy]] transformed into a heavy depression and the painter had to return to Moscow. Vladimir von Meck suggested the Vrubel family spend the summer in his mansion in the [[Kiev Governorate]]. That somehow cheered Vrubel up and Nadezhda was happy as well. Right before the departure, a two-years-old Savva Vrubel got sick. In Kiev, his disease got stronger, and on May 3, the child died. Vrubel moved from apathy to grief, starting actively plan the funeral. He tried to look peppy and support his wife, who did not say a word.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}} Savva was buried in the [[Baikove Cemetery]]. After losing their only child, the spouses went to von Meck since they did not know what to do next and how to behave. In the mansion, Vrubel's mental health significantly worsened, and in a week he said categorically: \"please, put me somewhere; otherwise, I will do you trouble\". However, he was very afraid of the clinic at the [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|Saint Cyril\u2019s Monastery]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}\n\nFollowing the advice of close to them doctor Tilling, it was decided to bring the painter to [[Riga]] where he was assigned to the country institution. Vrubel was in a heavy depression and wanted to commit suicide for which he refused to take any food. Symptoms were quite different from the previous crisis \u2013 instead of grandiose illusions Vrubel experienced delusions of self-abasement and hallucinations. However, the local doctor did not confirm the diagnosis of Bekhterev and Serbsky, claiming that Vrubel is an artist in melancholy and he needs to work. Thus, Vrubel returned to his old work the \"Easter jungle\" which was re-painted to \"Azrail\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=434}} Nadezhda Vrubel wrote to Anna Vrubel that Mikhail is sleep-deprived and he is again not satisfied with the face which he redrew continuously. Work did not improve his mental health. In addition, the painter became so weak that he could only move in a wheelchair while the flu that he had led to a [[rheumatism]]. His family and friends thought that he would not survive the following spring. However, the painter survived and in the summer, following the Serbsky's advise, on July 9, 1904, Vrubel was put in the sanitary clinic of {{ill|Fedor Usoltsev|ru|\u0423\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435\u0432, \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in Petrovsky park.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=436}}\n\n=== Treatment in the Usoltsev's clinic.

Sometimes he was even released to spend several hours alone with his wife. The idea behind rehabilitation in the Usoltsev's clinic was that patients would feel themselves like at home \u2013 that is why the clinic was in the private house of doctor Usoltsev where he and his family lived together with the patients. The doctor constantly invited artists and singers for organized house concerts. Patients attended evening events together with medical staff{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}.

At that time, the painter primarily drew portraits of doctors, orderlies, patients, acquaintances, players in cards and chess, landscape sketches. He also sketched the corners of his room and some simple objects, such as chairs, a dress threw on a chair, a crumpled bed (seria \"Insomnia\"), candlestick, carafe, a rose in a glass. Perhaps, with coming back to art, he felt the need to \"study [[figure drawing]] hard and humbly\". Instead of stylization, the painter applied a \"naive transfer of the most detailed life impressions\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}} Among other, Vrubel painted doctor Usoltsev, his wife and a student brother. The unfinished portrait of doctor Usoltsev against a gilded icon has been preserved. The painter was able to reflect on the patterned texture of the background and highlights on the image with only one black pencil without any colours, and he \"saved\" the face in these small details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=116}}\n\nIn summer 1904, Nadezhda Zabela got an offer from the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. Since Vrubel could not imagine his life without her and doctor Usoltsev did not insist on his staying in the clinic; spouses moved to Saint Petersburg. Soon after that, Nadezhda realized that her voice lost its previous tonality due to experienced events. Thus, she could not anymore perform in the opera and eventually found herself in a [[chamber music]]. In that period, Vrubel painted a large number of her portraits depicting Nadezhda in different scenes. One of these paintings is a two-meter canvas \"After a concert\" that depicted Zabela in a dress created according to a Vrubel's design.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=442}}\n\n[[File:1905 Vrubel nach dem Konzert anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|\u201dAfter a concert\u201d, 1905.

A double issue of the journal \"Mir Isskustva\" (issue 10-11, 1903) was fully dedicated to Vrubel and his legacy. The issue published reproductions of his paintings and many critics publicly renounced their previously published negative reviews. One of the reasons for such a drastic change was recognition of [[impressionism]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] among European artistic circles. Thus, a particular symbolism, emotionality and figurativism of Vrubel' paintings came into fashion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=117\u2014118}}\n\n[[File:\u00ab\u0416\u0435\u043c\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430\u00bb.jpg|thumb|left|The Pearl Shell, 1904.

I wanted to convey the drawing with all reality from which the game of pearl is constructed, and only after when I did several drawings with pencil and charcoal, I saw these princesses when I started to paint with colours\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}}}\n\nAt the same time, Dmitrieva did not appreciate this approach: \"figures that he unexpectedly for himself put in a pearl shell, hardly worthy of such a magical grotto. These cutesy figures are too reminiscent of their many long-haired sisters from a typical Art Nouveau decor; the artist himself vaguely felt it - he was not satisfied with his [[naiad]]s\". Later Vrubel kept seeing in their figures something obscene that appeared in the painting against his own will.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}\n\nIn February 1905, Vrubel again started having the symptoms of [[psychosis]]. Nadezhda summoned Usoltsev from Moscow to look after his patient. Mikhail Vrubel understood everything and did not resist. Before departure to Moscow on March 6, he started saying goodbye to his friends and relatives, came to see Pavel Chistyakov in the Academy of Arts and visited the Panaevsky Theatre where he saw his wife for the first time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=446}}\n\n===Last artistic activity===\n[[File:Vrubel Videnie proroka Iezekiilya 1906.jpg|thumb|The last Vrubel's painting \"The Vision of the Prophet Ezekiel\", 1906. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nVera Usoltseva, the wife of doctor Usoltsev, described Vrubel's condition to Nadezhda Vrubel as follows:\n{{Quote| Mikhail's condition did not change. His sleep seemed to be a bit longer. He usually sleeps through the night for five hours, and a rare day so that he does not sleep at least three hours. He eats well and in due time. But, unfortunately, he tore his new summer coat and trousers apart. He pretended to be calm, went to bed, covered himself with a blanket, and started to tugging the cloth underneath and tearing it into strips before the servant had noticed \u2026 His physical strength is high, which is rare for an intelligent person\u2026 You asked, should you write to him or not. No, you should not. He does not pay attention to letters and does not write them himself. He is often in the hands of delusion\u2026. the love to you is a red thread which is visible in all of his conversations\u2026 So, he explained to me that the coat and trousers would be of use to you if one puts multi-coloured pieces of matter into the holes\u2026.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=446\u2014448}}}}\n\nOnly after half of the year Vrubel started more or less adequately show responsiveness to the physical environment. However, his letters to Zabela are full of self-abasement and repentance. Despite the \"voices\" that tormented him, he returned to the theme of the Prophet, began to write the \"Six-winged Seraph\", and addressed the topic of vision of the Prophet [[Ezekiel]]. However, the painting remained unfinished since in the beginning of 1906, his vision started to drastically decrease proving the diagnosis of progressive paralysis. In addition, the painter was diagnosed with an [[optic neuropathy]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=449\u2014450}} Mikhail was kept in the clinic almost exclusively at the expense of his wife, which was not an easy task because a month of stay in the Usoltsev's clinic cost 100-150 rubles. On the contrary, the university clinic run by Serbsky costed only 9 rubles. The theatre administration understood the difficulty of Nadezhda's position. It kept her in the troupe on a salary of 3600 rubles per year that was sufficient enough to cover the expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=452}}\n\n[[File:Vrubel Bryusov.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Valery Bryusov, 1906.

On  November 28 1905, he was awarded the title Academician of painting \"for fame in the artistic field\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=452\u2014453}} After that, the editor of \"{{ill|Zolotoe runo|ru|\u0417\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u043d\u043e (\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b)}}\" Nicolai Ryabushinsky visited Vrubel in the clinic with the offer to paint  [[Valery Bryusov]]. The idea was to publish a series of portraits of famous contemporary writers. These portraits were supposed to be painted by the most acknowledged painters in the field. For instance, Serov was offered to paint [[Konstantin Balmont]]. Ryabushinsky paid 300 rubles for the portrait in advance and in addition bought  the [[self-portrait]] \u201cHead of Prophet\u201d for 100 rubles.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=451}} Bryusov later described the work on the portrait as follows:\n\n{{Quote|The door opened, and Vrubel came in. He entered with a wrong, heavy gait as if he was dragging his feet. To tell the truth, I was shocked when I saw Vrubel. It was a frail and sick person in a dirty, crumpled shirt. He had a reddish face and bird of prey eyes; protruding hair instead of a beard. First impression: crazy! <...> In real life, all small Vrubel's movement reflected his disorder. However, when his hand took a pencil or a lump of coal, it became very steady and confident. Lines that he drew were infallible.\n\nHis artistic strength survived everything else in him. The human died, was destroyed, but the master continued to live.\n\nDuring the first session, the first draft was already finished. I am really sorry that nobody thought of taking a picture of this dark drawing. It was almost even more remarkable in terms of performance, facial expression, and similarity than the later portrait painted with coloured pencils.{{sfn|\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432|2002|pp=242\u2014244}}}}\n\nThen Ryabushinsky commissioned Serov to paint the portrait of Vrubel. They organized the work, so Vrubel was able to paint Bruysov in the mornings, while Serov painted Vrubel in the afternoons.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=453}} Even though Nadezhda Zabela was concerned if Vrubel could handle such stress, Usoltsev categorically said that \"as an artist, he was healthy and deeply healthy.\" The first issue of the \"Zolotoe runo\" was published on February 1, 1906, with the Bryusov's poem \"To M. A. Vrubel\" opening the issue. Twelve days later, Vrubel complained to his wife that he could not read or paint. In few days, he became completely blind.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=456}}\n\n===Fading away.

After consulting with Usoltsev, it was decided to bring Vrubel back to Saint Petersburg since he did need any medical treatment only support from relatives and loved ones. Anna and Nadezhda settled in one apartment while Mikhail Vrubel was put in the excellent clinic run by doctor Konasevich where the painter celebrated his 50 years anniversary. However, the clinic was far away from home and had strict orders regarding the regime. Hence it was decided to transfer Vrubel to a hospital of Adolf Bari that was located on the 4-5 line of [[Vasilyevsky Island]] nearby the Academy of Arts and had a completely free regime.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=457}} Serov addressed the Academy of Arts with a request to pay Vrubel a monthly allowance that would cover some hospital expenses. The request was approved, and Vrubel started receiving 75 rubles in summer and 100 rubles in winter months.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=458}}\n\nAfter Vrubel lost his sight, his violent seizures occurred much rarer. Nadezhda visited him regularly and sometimes even organized home concerts. Anna Vrubel visited brother daily, walked with him and read to him. Especially often they re-read [[Ivan Turgenev]] 's [[prose poetry]] and [[Anton Chekhov]] 's novella [[The Steppe (novella)|The Steppe]] on the grounds of which Vrubel once created a painting. Ekaterina Ge later recalled:\n{{quote|... Mikhail Alexandrovich was very much engaged into reading and could not stand only sad endings, and always composed a new one instead, a more happy one \u2026 sometimes he was so got into himself that could listen to neither reading nor songs and was telling something like fairytales of his emerald eyes, life in the ancient world and how he made all the famous [[Renaissance]] works.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=457}}}}\n\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f.jpg|thumb|left|Vrubel\u2019s funeral on April 3, 1910.

Some days he experienced enlightening and then complained about the misfortune that befell him. Besides, he followed the ascetic practices that promised to bring back his lost sight \u2013 refused to eat, stood the whole night before the bed. Vrubel could not even recognize his old friends, for example, Polenov.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=459}} Later Anna Vrubel recalled that in the last year her brother was saying that he is tired of living. In severe February of 1910, he deliberately stood idle near with an open window and provoked pneumonia, which turned into a transient [[tuberculosis]]. At the same time, he retained his inherent aesthetics until the very last minute. Ekaterina Ge remembered that he \"took [[quinine]] almost with pleasure, and when he saw a [[sodium salicylate]], he said: \"This is so ugly\". Even before that the doctor Usoltsev wrote that \"It was different with him than with any other patients that usually lose the most thin or aesthetic sense first because for them they come the last; Vrubel's aesthetic sense died last because it was the first for him\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=461}}\n\nOn the eve of his death on 1 (14) April, 1910, Vrubel put himself in order, washed with cologne, and at night said to the nurse who was caring of him: \u201cNikolay, it\u2019s enough for me to lie here \u2013 we will go to the Academy.\u201d Indeed, the next day the coffin with Vrubel was put in the Academy of Arts.

Hence he borrowed 25 rubles from me and left. He came back soon, took a large basin and a bucket of water, and poured some cologne from a beautiful bottle from  [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]]  into the water. He undressed and stood in a basin, pouring himself out of a bucket. Then he lighted the iron stove and put four eggs inside, and later ate them with a loaf of baked bread.

She was buried near with her husband. Russian sculptor [[Leonid Sherwood]] decided to construct the tombstone on their graves, but by 1913 he was able only to set up the black granite pedestal. After the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] was severely damaged and many graves were destroyed. In the 1930s, a necropolis museum was organized in the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]]. Then they started to move the graves of famous artists from the Novodevichy Cemetery to a new museum, but the transfer remained unfinished due to lack of finance and later beginning of the [[World War II|war]]. An alleged transfer of the Vrubel\u2019s ash did not take place as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://family-history.ru/material/biography/mesto/vrubel/mogila/ |title=\u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447\u044c\u0435\u043c \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u0432 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0435 |publisher=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Family-History.ru |access-date=2014-11-17}}</ref> In 2015, the public initiated establishment of the new tombstone on the Vrubel\u2019s grave, but local authorities refused the installation.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=\u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f |url=https://planeta.ru/campaigns/mihail_vrubel |publisher=Planeta.ru |access-date=2017-10-29}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0410. |title=\u0412 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f |url=https://www.kp.ru/daily/26736/3763475/ |date=2017-09-26 |publisher=\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 |access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref>\n\nVrubel\u2019s works are exhibited in [[The State Tretyakov Gallery]] in Moscow, [[Russian Museum]] in Saint Petersburg, Vrubel Museum of Fine Arts in Omsk, Kiev Art Gallery, [[Odessa Art Museum]], [[Belarusian National Arts Museum]], and other places.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.artmuseum.by/ru/vyst/50-shedevrov-naczionalnogo-xudozhestvennogo-muzeya/m.-vrubel-%E2%80%9Cgenzel-i-gretel%E2%80%9D|title=\u041c. \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u201c\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438 \u0413\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u201d - \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c |publisher=www.artmuseum.by|accessdate=2019-01-11 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103060635/http://www.artmuseum.by/ru/vyst/50-shedevrov-naczionalnogo-xudozhestvennogo-muzeya/m.-vrubel-%E2%80%9Cgenzel-i-gretel%E2%80%9D |archivedate=2019-01-03}}</ref> Many commemorative sights and objects are named after Vrubel in Omsk, Kiev, Voronezh, Moscow, Saratov, Odessa.\n\nMany researchers and critics have differently evaluated the impact that Vrubel had on Russian and Global art. According to Dmitrieva, his role was \u201cexclusive and separated\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} She did not consider Vrubel as a typical representative of Art Nouveau, mainly because he \"coincided with Art Nouveau in his far from best features\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} According to Dmitrieva, Art Nouveau was not organic enough for Vrubel, much less than it was for [[L\u00e9on Bakst]] or Valentin Serov since Vrubel followed the \"cult of a deep nature\" that was not \"modern\" in its nature.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=338}}\n\nAccording to {{ill|Vladimir Lenyashin|ru|\u041b\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0448\u0438\u043d, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, Mikhail Vrubel was able to implement [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] as a harmonious aesthetic and philosophical system in the visual arts. At the same time, as a creator, he was supposed to be alone making the evolution from \"hermit, alchemist, alien from another esoteric space\" to the prophet{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=10}}. P. Klimov, who deliberately considered Vrubel's art in the context of Russian Art Nouveau, recognized him as a representative of the revolutionary thread of the Russian modern. Klimov also noted that Vrubel's position and significance in that cultural environment were only comparable to the place of [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]] in [[neoclassicism]]. This was due to a combination of natural Vrubel's gift and his later familiarization with Russian artistic world in general.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=64}}\n\nKlimov suggested that Vrubel started to express specific features of Art Nouveau already in the paintings from the \"Kiev period\", such as stylization as the main principle of form interpretation, aspiration for synthesis, emphasis on the role of the silhouette, cold colouring, symbolism of mood.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}}\n\nRapid evolution in the Vrubel's style could be explained with his detachment from any mainstream artistic movements of that time, such as neoclassicism or Peredvizhniki. Hence, he did not try to overcome the doctrines. Vrubel perceived academism as a starting point for his own movement forward, as a combination of essential professional skills.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}} In terms of personality and artistic thinking, Mikhail was a pronounced individualist; he was alien to the ideas of social justice, collegiality or Orthodox unity that inspired other artists of his generation. Moreover, the loneliness of Vrubel can be purely explained by his social environment since being a bourgeois art form Art Nouveau in the 1880s had not yet had its followers in Russia. Vrubel had to wait for his admirers, customers and patrons to appear only in the mid-1890s.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68, 73}}\n\n==In the cinema==\n* [[1953]] \u2014 ''[[Rimsky-Korsakov (film)|Rimsky-Korsakov]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430, \u0410. \u041d.\n|title=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438 \u0432 XIX \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0435\n|publisher=\u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\n|place=Moscow\n|year=1999\n|pages=448\n|isbn=5-250-02693-1\n|ref=\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0412. \u042f.\n|title=\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438. \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430. \u041f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430\n|place=Moscow\n|publisher=\u041e\u041b\u041c\u0410-\u041f\u0420\u0415\u0421\u0421\n|year=2002\n|pages=415\n|isbn=5-94850-030-6\n|ref=\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\n|title=\u0412\u0435\u0441\u044c \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433 \u043d\u0430 1914 \u0433\u043e\u0434, \u0430\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u0433. \u0421.-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\n|place=Saint Petersburg\n|publisher=\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0410. \u0421. \u0421\u0443\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u2013 \u00ab\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f\u00bb\n|year=1914\n|isbn=5-94030-052-9\n|ref=Suvorkin}} \n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\n|title=\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430. \u0412\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435\n|place=Leningrad\n|publisher=\u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\n|year=1976\n|pages=383\n|ref=\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0413\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d, \u041c. \u042e.\n|title=\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u0410\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c. \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438\n|place=Moscow\n|publisher=\u0410\u0412\u0420\u041e\u0420\u0410\n|year=2010\n|pages=160\n|isbn=978-5-7300-0825-0\n|ref=\u0413\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d. \u0410.\n|title=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432. \u0412\u044b\u043f.

19th-20th century Russian painter who worked in all genres of art, including painting, graphics, decorative sculpture, and theatrical art. In 1896, Vrubel married the famous singer [[Nadezhda Zabela-Vrubel]] whom he regularly painted. \n\nSoviet historian {{ill|Nina Dmitrieva|ru|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430}} compared Vrubel\u2019s artistic biography to a three-act drama with prologue and epilogue, while the transition between acts was rapid and unexpected. The \u201cPrologue\u201d refers to his earlier years of studying and choosing a career path. The \u201cfirst act\u201d peaked in the 1880s when Vrubel was studying at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and then moved to [[Kiev]] to study [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Christian art]]. The \u201csecond act\u201d corresponded to the so-called \u201cMoscow period\u201d that started in 1890 with the painting  \u201c[[The Demon Seated]]\u201d and ended in 1902 with the \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d and the subsequent hospitalization of the artist. The \u201cthird act\u201d lasted from 1903 to 1906 when Vrubel was suffering from his mental illness that gradually undermined his physical and intellectual capabilities. For the last four years of his life, already being blind, Vrubel lived only physically.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=20}}\n\nIn 1880-1890, Vrubel's creative aspirations did not find support of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and art critics. However, many private collectors and patrons were fascinated with his paintings, including famous [[wikt:Maecenas|maecenas]] [[Savva Mamontov]], as well as painters and critics who coalesced around the journal \u201c[[Mir iskusstva]]\u201d. Eventually, Vrubel's works were exhibited at Mir Iskusstva's own art exhibitions and [[Sergei Diaghilev]] retrospectives. At the beginning of the 20th century, Vrubel's art became an organic part of the Russian [[Art Nouveau]]. On November 28, 1905, he was awarded the title of Academician of Painting for his \u201cfame in the artistic field\u201d \u2013 just when Vrubel almost finished his career as an artist. \n\n==Becoming a painter==\n===Origin.

Great-grandfather of the artist \u2013 Anton Antonovich Vrubel \u2013 was originally from [[Bia\u0142ystok]] and served as a judge in his local town. His son {{ill|Mikhail Antonovich Vrubel|ru|\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (1799-1859) became a professional military.

At that time, the Astrakhan governor was a famous cartographer and admiral {{ill|Grigori Basargin|ru|\u0411\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. The governor\u2019s daughter Anna later married the second son of Mikhail Antonovich from the first marriage, Alexander, who previously graduated from the [[Cadet Corps]], served in the Tengin Infantry Regiment, participated in the [[Caucasian War|Caucasian]] and [[Crimean War]]s. In 1855, their first child Anna Aleksandrovna (1855-1928) was born. Altogether, they had four children, each of whom was born one after the other.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=7\u201412}}\n\nMikhail Vrubel was born on March 17, 1856. At that time, the Vrubel family lived in [[Omsk]] where Alexander was serving as a desk officer of the [[2nd Steppe Siberian Corps]]. Two other children, Alexander and Ekaterina, were also born in Omsk, however, they died before adolescence. Frequent childbirth and adverse [[Siberia]]n climate significantly weakened Mikhail\u2019s mother's health and in 1859 she died from [[tuberculosis|consumption]]. The future painter was only three years old when his mother died. One of the memories that Mikhail had from that period is how his sick mother lay in bed and cut out for her children \"little people, horses and different fantastic figures\" from paper.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=12\u201413}} Being a weak child from birth, Mikhail started to walk only at the age of three.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=5}}\n\n[[File:I 029.png|thumb|left|The Vrubel family in 1863.

In 1859, he was appointed to serve in  [[Astrakhan]] where he had relatives able to help him with children, but  already in 1861 the family had to relocate to  [[Kharkiv]]. There, little Mikhail quickly learned how to read and developed his interest in book illustrations, especially those from the journal \"[[Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye]]\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=14\u201415}}\n\nIn 1863, Alexander Vrubel got married for the second time to Elizaveta Vessel from Saint Petersburg, who dedicated herself to her husband's children (her own child was born only in 1867). In 1867, the family moved to [[Saratov]] where [[podpolkovnik]] Vrubel took command of the provincial garrison. The Vessel family belonged to [[intelligentsia]] \u2013 a status class of educated people engaged in shaping the culture and politics of their society. Elizaveta\u2019s sister Alexandra Vessel graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] and largely contributed to the introducing Mikhail to the world of music. Elizaveta herself spent a lot of time on improving Mikhail\u2019s health; later he even ironically recalled that she made him follow  the \"diet of raw meat and fish oil\". However, there is no doubt that he owes his physical strength to the regime maintained by his stepmother.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=16\u201418}} In addition, Elizaveta's brother, professional teacher {{ill|Nicolai Vessel|ru|\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, also participated in children's education by introducing educational games and home entertainments. Despite the generally good relationships among all the relatives, Anna and Mikhail kept a little aloof from them. Sometimes they behaved coldly to their stepmother calling her with an ironic nickname \"Madrin'ka \u2014 perl materei\". They also explicitly expressed their desire to start an independent life outside home thus making their father upset.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=20\u201422}} By the age of 10, Mikhail expressed artistic talents through drawing, theater and music practicing; that altogether occupied in his future life no less place than painting. According to Dmitrieva, \"the boy was like a boy, gifted, but rather promising a versatile amateur than an obsessed artist, whom he later became\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0441 \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|Vrubel with his sister Anna.

At that time, a copy of \"[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The last Judgement]]\" by [[Michelangelo]] was exhibited in Saratov. The painting impressed Mikhail so much, that, according to his sister, he reproduced it from his memory in all details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=28}}\n\n===Gymnasium===\n\nMikhail Vrubel started his education at the {{ill|Fifth St. Petersburg Gymnasium|ru|\u041f\u044f\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f}} where the school directorate paid particular attention to the modernization of teaching methods, the advancement of [[Classics|classical studies]], the literary development of high school students, dance and gymnastics lessons. His father Alexander was also in Saint Petersburg, voluntarily attending lectures at the [[Alexander Military Law Academy]] as an auditor. In addition to his studies at the gymnasium, Mikhail attended painting classes at the school of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]]. However, he was most interested in natural sciences thanks to his teacher Nicolai Peskov who was a political exile. In 1870, after living three years in Saint Petersburg , the Vrubel family moved to [[Odessa]] where Alexander was appointed as a judge in the garrison court.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=30\u201431}}\n\nIn Odessa, Mikhail studied at the [[Richelieu Lyceum]]. Several letters from him to his sister Anna who was  receiving teacher education in Saint Petersburg have been preserved. The first letter dated October 1872; both letters are large and easy to read, with many quotes in French and [[Latin]]. In these letters, Mikhail mentioned the paintings that he made \u2013 the portrait of his smaller brother Alexander who died in 1869 (reproduced from the photograph), and the portrait of Anna hanging in the father's office. However, comparing to other interests that Mikhail had, painting classes did not occupy much of his time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=5\u20147}}{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=33\u201434}} Vrubel was a quick learner and was the first in his class. He had a special interest in literature, languages, history, and, on vacations,  he loved to read to his sister in original Latin. The future painter devoted even his free time to favourite activities. For instance, in one of his letters, he complained to Anna that instead of reading [[Goethe's Faust]] in original and completing  50 exercises in English textbook, he copied in oil \"Sunset at Sea\" by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}} At the same time, one might say that at that time Mikhail was more interested in theatrical art rather than painting, since he barely mentioned the \"[[Peredvizhniki]]\" exhibition in Odessa but spent several pages describing the Saint Petersburg opera troupe.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}}\n\n===University===\n[[File:Anna Karenina Wrubel.jpg|thumb|right|The date of Anna Karenina with the son, 1878]]\n\nAfter graduating with a distinction, neither Vrubel nor his parents thought of his career as an artist. It was decided to send Mikhail to Saint Petersburg where he could study at the  [[Saint Petersburg State University]] and live with his uncle Nicolai Vessel, who would also cover Vrubel\u2019s everyday expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}} Mikhail\u2019s decision to study  at the [[Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] was differently interpreted by Vrubel\u2019s biographers. For example, [[Alexandre Benois]], who studied at the same faculty, suggested that the rationale behind this decision was the family tradition and values that legal profession had among their social circles. In 1876, Vrubel had to repeat the second year due to poor grades and a desire to strengthen his knowledge on the subjects. However, even though Mikhail studied for a year more than was expected, he could not defend his thesis and graduated in the rank of \"{{ill|deistvitel'nyi student|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442}}\" which was the lowest scientific degree that one can graduate with.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=41}} Despite deep engagement with philosophy and, particularly, the theory of aesthetics by [[Immanuel Kant]], Mikhail\u2019s s [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle that his uncle allowed him to maintain was partly to blame for not finishing the university. At that time, Vrubel did not spend much time on practicing painting,{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=48\u201450}} though he made several illustrations for literary works  both classic and contemporary. According to Dmitrieva, \"in general\u2026 Vrubel's art is thoroughly \"literary\": a rare work of his does not originate in a literary or  theatrical source\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=18}} One of the most famous compositions from that period is \"The date of [[Anna Karenina]] with the son\". According to Domitieva, this was his \"pre-Vrubel\" stage since the painting mostly reminds of journal illustrations of that time: \"utterly romantic, even melodramatic, and very carefully decorated\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=50\u201452}} Active participation in theatrical life (Vrubel personally knew [[Modest Mussorgsky]] who frequently visited the Vessel's house) required considerable expenses which is why Vrubel regularly worked as a tutor and a [[governess]]. In 1875, he even travelled to Europe with one of his pupils; together, they visited [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]]. In addition, Mikhail spent the summer of 1875 at the estate belonged to a Russian lawyer {{ill|Dmitrii Berr|ru|\u0411\u0435\u0440, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (His wife Yulia Berr was a niece of [[Mikhail Glinka]]). Then, due to the excellent knowledge of Latin, Vrubel was hired as a tutor at the Papmel family where he guided his former university classmate.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=57\u201459}} According to the memoirs of A. I. Ivanov:\n\n{{Quote|Vrubel lived with the Papmel family as a relative: in the winter he went to the opera with them, in the summer he moved with everyone to their cottage in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]]. Papmels put on quite a spread and everything about them was opposite to the way the Vrubel family lived; their house was a full bowl, even in an excessively literal sense, and during his time with Papmels, Vrubel firstly discovered his passion for wine which was never been lacking.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=61}}}}\n\nIt was the Papmel family prone to [[aestheticism]] and bohemian lifestyle that encouraged Vrubel's [[dandy]]ism and a desire to paint. In one of his letters from 1879, Vrubel mentioned that he renewed his acquaintance with a Russian watercolourist Emilie Villiers, who in every possible way patronized Mikhail' pictorial experiences in Odessa. Later, Vrubel began to communicate closely with students of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] who worked under the patronage of a famous Russian painter [[Pavel Chistyakov]]. Vrubel started attending evening academic classes where auditioning was allowed, and started to hone plastic skills.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=63\u201464}} As a result, at the age of 24, Vrubel had a crucial turning point in his life \u2013 after graduating from the university and serving a short military service, Vrubel was admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n==The 1880s==\n===The Academy of Arts===\n[[File:Serov Chistyakov.jpg|thumb|left|The portrait of Chistyakov by [[Valentin Serov]], 1881]]\n\nAccording to Domiteeva, Vrubel's decision to study at the Academy of Arts came from his engagement with the Kant's theory of aesthetic ideas. His younger colleague and an admirer {{ill|Stepan Yaremich|ru|\u042f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447, \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} suggested that Vrubel adopted Kant's philosophy that \"clarity of the division between physical and moral life\" led over time to a separation of these areas in the real life. Mikhail Vrubel demonstrated \"softness, pliability, shyness in little things in everyday life; while iron perseverance accompanied his general higher direction of life\". However, this was only one side of the story \u2013 undoubtedly, at the age of 24, Vrubel considered himself as a genius. According to the Kant's theory of aesthetics, the  \u201cgenius\u201d category  implied working in a sphere \u201cbetween freedom and nature\u201d that could only be achieved in the field of arts. For a young and gifted Vrubel that inspired his long-term life plan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=66\u201467}}\n\nStarting from the autumn of 1880, Vrubel audited classes in the Academy and, presumably, started having private lessons at the [[Pavel Chistyakov|Chistyakov's]] studio. However, these lessons were documented only starting from 1882; the painter himself claimed that he studied with Chistyakov for four years. In his autobiography dated 1901, the painter characterized years spent in the Academy as \"the brightest in his artistic career\" thanks to Chistyakov. This does not contradict what he wrote to his sister in 1883 (when they renewed mutual correspondence that was broken off for six years):\n\n{{Quote|When I started my lessons with Chistyakov, I passionately followed his main statements because they were nothing less than a formula of my living attitude towards nature, that is embedded in me.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=21}}}}\n\nAmong Chistyakov\u2019s students there were  [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], and [[Valentin Serov]] all of whom painted in different styles. All of them, including Vrubel, recognized Chistyakov as their only teacher, honouring him to the last days. Due to scepticism prevailed among the second generation of scholars, this type of relationship between the mentor and his students was not quite appreciated. Chistyakov's method was purely [[Academic Art|academic]], but very \u201cindividualistic\u201d since Pavel inspired \"sacred concepts\" in working on a plastic form, but also taught conscious drawing as well as structural analysis of the form. According to Chistyakov, in order to construct the painting one needs to break it down to several small planes transmitted by flatnesses, and these planes would form the faces of the volume with its hollows and bulges. Vrubel's  \"crystal-like\" technique was thus fully mastered by his teacher.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=22\u201423}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041f\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0438\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Feasting Romans, 1883]]\nOne of the most crucial acquaintances that Vrubel met during his time in the Academy was [[Valentin Serov]]. Despite a 10-year age difference, they were connected on different levels, including the deepest one.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=72\u201474}} Throughout the years spent at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel's motives drastically changed: his dandyism was replaced with [[asceticism]], about which he proudly wrote to his sister.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=81}} Starting from 1881,  after transferring to a life model class, Mikhail visited both Chistyakov's classes and morning watercolour lessons at the Repin's studio. However, their relationship with Repin got complicated quickly due to the argument on the painting \"[[Religious Procession in Kursk Governorate]]\". In one of the letters to his sister, Vrubel mentioned that by \"taking advantage of the [public] ignorance, Repin stole that special pleasure that distinguishes the state of mind before a work of art from the state of mind before the expanded printed sheet\". This quote clearly illustrates Chistyakov's influence on Vrubel\u2019s philosophy since Pavel was the one who suggested that obedience of techniques to art is the fundamental spiritual property of the Russian creativity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=84\u201485}}\n\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0449\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0420\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430.jpg|thumb|left|Model in a Renaissance setting]] \nOne of the brightest examples of Vrubel's academic work is his sketch \"Feasting Romans\". Even though it formally compiled with rules of academic art, the painting violates all  the main canons of academism \u2013  the composition does not have the main focus, the plot is unclear.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=28}}\n\nJudging by the correspondence between Vrubel and his sister, the painter spent almost two years on the painting. The plot was simple: a cupbearer and  a young [[citharode]] wink to each other sitting nearby the sleeping [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]. The view was quite whimsical \u2013 from somewhere on the balcony or a high window. It implied a dim lighting \"after sunset, without any reflections of light\" for strengthening the silhouette effects. Vrubel's intention was to make \"some similarities with [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]\". The final watercolour sketch grew with sub-stickers and caused Repin\u2019s enthusiasm. However, Vrubel felt intuitively the limit of unsteady forms and eventually abandoned the unfinished paintings refusing to paint a historical picture.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=104\u2014106}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c - \u0413\u0430\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u041e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f (1884).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hamlet and Ophelia, 1884]]\nHowever, Vrubel did not abandon his idea to get paid for his creative work. Thanks to the Papmel family, he received a commission from the industrialist {{ill|Leopold Koenig|ru|\u041a\u0451\u043d\u0438\u0433, \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0434 \u0415\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. According to the mutual agreement,  the subject and technique of the painting would be left at the discretion of the artist and the fee would be 200 rubles. Mikhail also decided to participate in the contest initiated by the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] and chose the plot of \"[[Hamlet]] and [[Ophelia]]\" in the style of [[Madonna of Loreto| Rafael's realism]]. The self-portrait sketches of Hamlet and watercolors for the general composition which depict the Danish prince as represented by Vrubel have been preserved.  However, the work on the painting was complicated with worsening relationship between the painter and his father.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=106\u2014108}} Having failed with the \"Hamlet\" as well, Vrubel was persuaded by his friends to depict a real life model. For this role, they chose an experienced model Agafya who was put in the same chair that served as decorations for the \u201cHamlet\u201d, while student {{ill|Vladimir Derviz|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0437, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} brought some [[Florence|Florentine]] [[velvet]], [[Venice|Venetian]] brocade and other things from the [[Renaissance]] period from his parents house.  Vrubel successfully finished the painting  \"Sitter in the Renaissance Setting\" with characteristic for Vrubel \u201cpainting embossing\u201d . Under the impression from the \"Sitter\", Vrubel returned to \"Hamlet\". This time he painted with oil on a canvas with Serov as a model.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=108\u2014110}}\n\nDespite the formal success, Vrubel was not able to graduate from the Academy. However, in 1883, his painting \"Betrothal of Mary and Joseph\" received the silver medal from the Academy. Following the recommendation of Chistyakov, in the autumn of 1883, professor [[Adrian Prakhov]] invited Vrubel to [[Kiev]] to work on a restoration of the 12th century [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's Monastery]]. The offer was flattering and promised good earnings therefore the artist agreed to go after the end of the academic year.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=111}}\n\n===Kiev===\n[[File:Vrubel Self Portrait 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait, 1885]]\n\nThe years that Vrubel spent in Kiev turned out to be almost the most important in his career. For the first time in Vrubel\u2019s life, the painter was able to pursue his monumental intentions and return to the fundamentals of the Russian art. In five years, Mikhail completed an enormous amount of paintings. For instance, he single-handedly painted murals and icons for the  [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's church]], as well as made 150 drawings for the restoration the figure of an angel in the dome of the St. Sophia Cathedral. As Dmitrieva noted:\n{{Quote|Such a \"co-authorship\" with the masters of the 12th century was unknown to any of the great artists of the 19th century.

He felt like an accomplice in the hard work of the ancient masters and tried to be worthy of them.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=34}}}}\n\nPrakhov\u2019s invitation was almost coincidental, as he was looking for a qualified painter with some academic training to paint murals in the church, but at the same time not to be recognised enough so he would not require a higher salary.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=113}} Judging from the correspondence with the family, Vrubel's contract with Prakhov was for the completion of four icons in the duration of 76 days.

Lev Kovalsky, who in 1884 was a student at the  Kiev Art School appointed to pick Mikhail up in the station, later recalled:\n{{Quote|... Against a background of primitive Kirillovsky hills, a blond, almost white, young man with a particular head and small, almost white, moustaches, stood behind my back.

The fresco reflected most of the Vrubel's characteristic features and depicted twelve Apostles that are situated in a semicircle at the box vault of the choirs. The standing figure of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is located in the center of the composition. The background is coloured in blue while the golden rays are coming up to the apostles from the circle featuring the [[Holy Spirit]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=34}} The model for the Mary\u2019s figure was a paramedic M. Ershova \u2013 a frequent guest in the Prakhov's house and the future wife of one of the painters participating in the restoration process.  To Mary\u2019s left stands the apostle that was painted from [[protoiereus]] Petr (Lebedintsev) who at that time taught at the Richelieu lyceum. To Mary's right stands the second apostle for whom the Kiev archaeologist {{ill|Viktor Goshkevich|ru|\u0413\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447, \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} was modelling. The third from the right was the head of the Kirillovsky parish Peter Orlovsky who originally discovered the remains of old paintings and interested the [[Imperial Russian Archaeological Society]] in their reconstruction. The fourth apostle, folded his hands in a prayer, was Prakhov. Besides the \"Descent\", Vrubel painted the \"The entry into Jerusalem\" and \"The Angels\u2019Lamentation\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=124}} The \"Descent\" was painted directly on the wall, without any cardboard and even any preliminary sketches \u2013 only certain details were previously specified on small sheets of paper. Remarkably, the painting depicts Apostles in a semicircle with their [[Halo (religious iconography)|limbs]] connecting to the Holy Spirit emblem. This painting style was of Byzantine origin and was inspired with hammered [[winged altarpiece]] from one of the [[\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438|Tiflis]] monasteries.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=123\u2014125}}\n\n===The first trip to Italy===\n[[File:Vrubel Moses.jpg|thumb|right|Icon of the Prophet Moses]]\nVrubel travelled to Venice together with Samuel Gaiduk who was a young artist painting in accordance with Mikhail's sketches.  Their trip had been not without some \u201cadventures\u201d, however. According to Prakhov, Vrubel met his friend from St. Petersburg with whom they went out partying during the transfer in [[Vienna]]. Gaiduk, who successfully reached Venice,  waited two days for Vrubel to arrive. Life in Venice in winter was cheap, and painters shared a studio in the city centre on Via San Maurizio. They both were interested in churches on the abandoned island [[Torcello]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=134\u2014135}}\n\nDmitrieva described Vrubel's artistic evolution as following: \"Neither [[Titian]] and [[Paolo Veronese]], nor magnificent [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] atmosphere of the Venetian [[Cinquecento]] attracted him. The range of his Venetian addictions is clearly defined: from medieval mosaics and stained glass of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] and [[Torcello Cathedral]] to painters of the early Renaissance [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Cima da Conegliano]] (the figures of which Vrubel found especially noble), [[Giovanni Bellini]]. <...> If the first meeting with Byzantine-Russian art in Kiev enriched Vrubel's envisioning of plastic forms, then Venice enriched his palette and awakened his gift as a colourist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=37\u201438}}\"\n\nThese features can be clearly observed in all the three icons that Vrubel painted in Venice for the St. Cyril's Church \u2013 \"Saint Kirill\", \"Saint Afanasii\", and gloomy-coloured \"Christ the Savior\". Being accustomed to intensive work at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel painted all four icons in a month and a half and felt a crave for activities and the lack of communication. In Venice, he accidentally met [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] who was married to one of the Chistyakov' students. Together they discussed how to preserve paintings in the condition of high humidity as well as argued on the advantages of writing in oil on [[zinc]] boards before painting on a canvas. The zinc boards for Vrubel' icons were delivered directly from Kiev; however, for a long time painter could not establish his own techniques and the paint could not stick to the metal. In April, Vrubel only wanted to come back to Russia.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=140,148\u2014149}}\n\n===Kiev and Odessa===\n[[File:Vrubel Angel.jpg|thumb|right|Angel with censer and candle. Fresco sketch for the Vladimir Cathedral, 1887]]\nAfter returning from Venice in 1885, Vrubel spent May and part of June in Kiev. There were rumours that immediately after he came back, he proposed to Emily Prakhova despite her being a married woman. According to one version of the story, Vrubel proclaimed his decision not to Emily but to her husband Adrian Prakhov. Even though Mikhail Vrubel was not denied access to the house, Prakhov was definitely \"afraid of him\" while Emily resented his immaturity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=150}} Apparently, the incident described a year later by Vrubel\u2019s friend [[Konstantin Korovin]] belongs to this period:\n{{Quote|It was a hot summer. We went swimming at the big lake in the garden. <...> \"What are these big white strips at your chest that look like scars?\" \u2013\" Yes, these are scars. I cut myself with a knife.\" <...> \"... But still tell me, Mikhail Alexandrovich, why did you cut yourself \u2013 it must be painful.

I suffered from the inability to explain this to her.

Edwards, together with [[Kyriak Kostandi]], tried to reform the Odessa Art School and decided to decided to elicit Vrubel's help. He settled Vrubel in his own house and tried to persuade him to stay in Odessa forever.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=151\u2014153}} In summer, Serov arrived in Odessa and Vrubel for the first time told him about his plan to paint the \"[[Demon (poem)|Demon]]\". In letters to his family, Vrubel also mentioned a [[tetralogy]] that probably became one of his side interests. In 1886 Vrobel went to Kiev to celebrate the new year using the money that his father sent him for a trip home (at that time the family resided in Kharkiv).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=162\u2014163}}\n\nIn Kiev, Vrubel met frequently with associates of writer [[Ieronim Yasinsky]]. He also met Korovin for the first time. Despite the intensive work, the painter led a \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle and became a regular in the [[caf\u00e9-chantant]] \u00abShato-de-fler\u00bb. This depleted his meager salary and the main source of income became the sugar manufacturer [[Ivan Tereshchenko]] who immediately gave the painter 300 rubles toward the expenses of his planned \"Oriental Tale\". Vrubel used to throw his money in the caf\u00e9-\u0441hantant.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=174\u2014177}}\n\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0447.jpg|thumb|left|Tombstone Crying, the second version. Akvarel, 1887. Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\nAt the same time, Adrian Prakhov organized painting of the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]] and, without regard to his personal attitudes, invited Vrubel. Despite Vrubel's carelessness towards his works inspired with his \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle, he created no less than six versions of the \"Tombstone Crying\" (only four of them have been preserved). The story is not included in the [[Gospel]] and not usual for the [[Russian icons|Russian Orthodox]] art, but can be seen in some icons from the Italian Renaissance. Though he clearly understood their significance and originality, Prakhov rejected Vrubel's independent paintings since they differed significantly from the works of other participating colleagues and would have unbalanced the relative integrity of the already-assembled murals.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=10}} Prakhov once noted that the a new cathedral \"in a very special style\" would need to be built to accommodate Vrubel' paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=44}}\n\nIn addition to commissioned works, Vrubel attempted to paint \"Praying for the cup\" just \"for himself\". However, he experienced a severe mental crisis while trying to finish it. He wrote to his sister:\n{{Quote|I draw and paint Christ with all my might, but, at the same time, presumably, because I am far away from my family, all religious rituals, including [[Resurrection of Jesus]] look so alien, that I am even annoyed with it.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=48}}}}\n\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - The Girl Against the Background of Persian Carpet.png|thumb|right|Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet, 1886. Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\nWhile painting murals in the Kiev churches, Vrubel simultaneously was drawn to the image of the Demon. According to P. Klimov, it was quite logical and even natural for Vrubel to transfer techniques acquired during the painting of sacred images to completely opposite images, and it illustrates the direction of his pursuits.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=11}} His father Alexander visited him in Kiev when Mikhail had some intense mental struggles.

He even noted that this painting would be unlikely to connect with either the public or with representatives of the Academy of art.  As a result, Mikhail destroyed the painting, and many other works that he created in Kiev.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=179}} To earn a living, the painter started to paint the already promised \"Oriental Tail\", but could only finish a watercolour. He tried to give it to Emily Prakhova as a gift; and tore it up after she rejected it.  But then he reconsidered and glued together the pieces of the destroyed work. The only finished painting from this period was the \"Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet\" depicting Mani Dakhnovich, the daughter of the loan office owner. Dmitrieva defined the genre of this painting as a \u201cportrait-fantasy\u201d. The customer, though, did not like the final version, and the work was later bought by Tereshchenko.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=20\u201423}}\n\nThe painter's mental crisis is clear in the following incident. On a visit to Prakhov, where a group of artists were participating in the painting of the cathedral, Vrubel proclaimed that his father died and so he needed urgently to travel to Kharkiv. The painters raised money for his trip. The next day, Alexander Vrubel came to Prakhov looking for his son. Confused Prakhov had to explain to him that Vrubel\u2019s disappearance was due to his infatuation with an English singer from the caf\u00e9-chantant.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=183\u2014184}} Nevertheless, friends tried to ensure that Vrubel had regular income. He was assigned a minor work in the Vladimyr's Cathedral \u2013 to draw ornaments and the \"Seven days for an eternity\" in one of the [[plafond]]s according to the sketches made by brothers [[Pavel Svedomsky|Pavel]] and {{ill|Alexander Swedomsky|ru|\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}.

Most likely, he travelled there because he fell in love with a circus horsewoman which he met thanks to Yasinsky's brother who performed under the pseudonym \"Alexander Zemgano\". As a result, Vrubel settled at the Korovin\u2019s studio on the {{ill|Dolgorukovskaya street|ru|\u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430}}.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=193\u2014194}} Vrubel, Korovin and Serov even had an idea to share a studio but, however, it did not translate into reality due to deteriorating relations with Serov.

Altogether, there were 18 painters, including Ilya Repin, [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], [[Leonid Pasternak]], [[Apollinary Vasnetsov]]. Of these, Vrubel was the only one who was completely unknown to the public.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=225}} It is not known who drew the the publishers' attention to Vrubel.

Due to their complexity, his paintings were hard to reproduce and Vrubel had to amend them. The main difficulty, however, was that his colleagues did not understand Vrubel's art. In spite of this, the illustrated publication was approved by the [[Censorship in the Russian Empire|censorship authorities]] on April 10, 1891. Immediately thereafter the publication was widely discussed in the press who harshly criticized illustrations for their \"rudeness, ugliness, caricature, and absurdity\" (it is interesting that in 20 years critics will argue that it was Vrubel who was able to \"translate into a new language\" the poetic essence of Lermontov's spirit).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=231\u2014232}} Even people who were well-disposed to Vrubel did not understand him.

However, both of these studies differed in the aspects of art. For instance, Mamontov mostly concentrated on theatrical and architecture projects while Tenisheva focused on Russian national traditions.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=199}}   Ceramics of the Abramtsevo Potter's Factory played a significant role in the revival of #REDIRECT [[maiolia]] in Russia. Vrubel was attracted to maiolica because of its simplicity, spontaneity of generalization of form with a rough texture and whimsical spills of glaze. Ceramics allowed Vrubel to experiment freely with plastic and artistic possibilities of the material.

They planned travel itineraries around the interests of Abramtsevo pottery studio. Vrubel accompanied the family as a consultant which led to a conflict between him and Mamontov's wife, Elizaveta. Thus, Mamontov and Vrubel went to [[Milan]] where Vrubel\u2019s sister Elizaveta (Liliia) was studying.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=263}} It was suggested that the painter would spend winter in [[Rome]] where he might finish the Mamontov's order \u2013 decorations for \"[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]\" and design the new curtain for the [[Private Opera]]. Savva Mamontov paid Vrubel a monthly salary; however, an attempt to settle him in the Mamontov's house led to a scandal with Elizaveta after which Vrubel decided to stay with Svedomsky.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=264}}\n\nVrubel did not get along with other Russian artists working in Rome and continuously accused them with the lack of artistic talent, plagiarism, and other things. He was much closer to brothers Alexander and Pavel Svedomsky with whom he regularly visited variete \"Apollon\" and cafe \"Aran'o\". He also enjoyed their studio which was rebuilt from the former greenhouse. It had glass walls and the Roman ceiling which made it very hard to stay there in winter due to cold.  Svedomskys unconditionally recognized Vrubel's creative superiority and not only settled him at their house but also shared commercial orders with him.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=264\u2014266}} In the end, Mamontov arranged Vrubel's stay at the studio of half Italian [[Alexander Rizzoni]] who graduated from the Russian Academy of Arts. Vrubel highly respected him and willingly worked under the Rizzoni's supervision. The main reason for this was that Rizzoni considered himself as not entitled to interfere in the painter's personal style, but was picky about diligence. Vrubel subsequently wrote that \"I have not heard from many people so much fair but benevolent criticism\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=267}}\n\nIn winter 1892, Vrubel decided to participate in the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] where he got an idea for the painting \"Snow-maiden\" (not preserved). Elizaveta Mamontova later wrote:\n{{Quote|I visited Vrubel, he painted a life-size Snow Maiden's head in watercolour against the background of a pine tree covered with snow. Beautiful in colours, but the face had gumboil and angry eyes.

The main feature of this composition is its timelessness \u2013 it is impossible to say when the action took place. The figures were chaotically arranged, \"compressing\" space, which is projected onto the plane.

For instance, the painter received the order to decorate the Dunker family mansion on the Povarskaya Street. Also, together with the most famous architect of Moscow Art Nouveau [[Fyodor Schechtel]], Vrubel decorated the Zinaida Morozova's mansion on Spiridonovka street and A.

The painter combined painting with architecture, sculpture and applied art. Karpova recognized his leading role in creating ensembles of Moscow Modern. Vrubel's sculpture attracted the attention of his contemporaries. For instance, at the end of his life,  [[Aleksandr Matveyev (sculptor)|Aleksandr Matveyev]] mentioned that \"without Vrubel there would be no [[Sergey Konenkov]]...\".{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}}\n\nThe gothic composition \"Robert and the Nuns\" is usually considered as the most important Vrubel's sculpture; it decorates the staircase of the Morozov mansion.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}} Literature on architecture emphasizes the exclusive role that Vrubel played in forming artistic appearances of the Moscow Art Nouveau.

After arriving in Nizhny Novgorod on April 25, Benois sent a telegram: \n{{quote| Vrubel's panels are terrifying; we need to take them off, waiting for the juri.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=304}}}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel.

The committee included [[Vladimir Aleksandrovich Beklemishev]], [[Konstantin Savitsky]], [[Pavel Brullov]], and others. They concluded that it is impossible to exhibit Vrubel's works. Mamontov told Vrubel to continue working and went to Saint Petersburg to persuade the members of the committee. At the same time, while trying to put the plot of \"Mikula Selyaninovich\" on a canvas , Vrubel realized that he previously was not able to proportionate the figures properly. Thus he started to paint the new version right on the stage of the pavilion. Mamontov attempted to protect the painter and called for the convening of the new committee. However, his claims were rejected, and on May 22 Vrubel had to leave the exhibition hall while all of his works had been already taken.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=304\u2014305}}\n\nVrubel lost nothing financially since Mamontov bought both paintings for {{nobr|5 000}} rubles each. He also agreed with [[Vasily Polenov]] and Konstantin Korovin for them finishing the half-ready \"Mikula\". Canvases were rolled up and brought back to Moscow where Polenov and Korovin started working on them while Vrubel was finishing \"The Princess of the Dream\" in a shed of the Abramtsevo Pottery factory. Both canvases arrived in Nizhny Novgorod right before the emperor's visit scheduled on July 15-17.

On the contrary, Maxim Gorky was against Vrubel. He made fun of \"Mikula\" by comparing it with a fictional character Chernomor. \"The Princess of the Dream\" resent him with its \"antics, ugliness of otherwise beautiful plot\".

Around the same time, the Russian premiere of the [[fairy-tail opera]] \u201c[[Hansel and Gretel (opera)|Hansel and Gretel]]\u201d was about to take place.

Originally, Konstantin Korovin was responsible for the decorations and costumes but because of illness had to renounce the order in favour of Mikhail Vrubel who had never even attended an opera before.

Nevertheless, on July 28 they engaged in the [[Russian Church, Geneva|Cathedral of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross]] in Geneva, Switzerland. The couple spent their honeymoon in a guesthouse in [[Lucerne]]. Then Vrubel continued his work on the panel for the Morozov\u2019s gothic cabinet.

However, Vrubel did not many commissions in the city and had to live on his wife\u2019s money. This prompted him to turn to theatrical painting and costume designs.

His [[migraine]]s got so strong that the painter had to take [[phenacetin]] in large quantities (according to his sister in law \u2013 up to 25 [[grain]]s and more).

The painter was able to finish ''Pan'' in one day while being in [[Princess Maria Tenisheva|Tenisheva]]\u2019s mansion in [[Talashkino]]. The plot was drawn in a canvas on which he previously started to paint the portrait of his wife.

Starting from the next year, the painter was torn between the paintings \u201c{{ill|Flying Demon|ru|\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439}}\u201d and \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d. As a result, he chose the first variant, but the painting remained unfinished. The painting and several illustrations were inspired by intertwined plots of Lermontov\u2019s Demon and Pushkin\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet\u201d.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=17}} \n\n[[File:Wrubel-Portrait of Son-1902.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of the painter\u2019s son, 1902.

The baby boy was born strong with well-developed muscles but had an [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|orofacial cleft]]. Nadezhda\u2019s sister, Ekaterina Ge, suggested that Mikhail had \u201ca particular taste hence he could find beauty in a certain irregularity. And this child, despite his lip, was so cute with his big blue eyes that his lip shocked people only in the first moment and then everyone would forget about it\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}\nWhile working on \u201cDemon\u201d, the painter created the large watercolour portrait of a six-month child sitting in a baby carriage. As [[Nikolai Tarabukin]] later recalled:\n{{Quote|The scared and mournful face of this tiny creature flashed like a meteor in this world and was full of unusual expressiveness and some childish wisdom.

Nadezhda Vruble decided to take a break in her career and refused to hire a nanny. Hence, Mikhail Vrubel had to support his family. Starting from September-October 1901, Vrubel had experienced first depression symptoms due to drastically increased number of working hours. Starting from November, he stopped working on \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d. Vrubel\u2019s biographer later wrote:\n{{Quote|For the whole winter Vrubel worked very intensively. Despite usual 3-4 hours, he worked up to 14 hours, and sometimes even more, with a flash of artificial lightning, never leaving the room and barely coming off the painting. Once a day he put up a coat, opened window leaf and inhaled some cold air \u2013 and called it his \u201cpromenade\u201d. Fully engaged in work, he became intolerant to any disturbance, did not want to see any guests and barely talked to the family. The ''Demon'' was many times almost finished, but Vrubel re-painted it over and over again.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=397}}}}\n{{wide image|Vrubel Fallen Demon.jpg|500px|''Demon Downcast'', 1902.

It is unusually spectacular, and was, even more, striking upon its creation when the pink crown sparkled, the peacock feathers flickered and shimmered (after a few years, the dazzling colours began to darken, dry up and now almost blackened). This exaggerated decorative effect itself deprives the painting of actual depth. To amaze and shock, the artist, who had already lost his emotional balance, betrayed his \u201ccult of a deep nature\u201d - and ''The Demon Dawncast'', from the purely formal side, more than any other paintings by Vrubel, was painted in the modern style\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=79}}\n\nVrubel\u2019s mental health continued to worsen. He started suffering from insomnia, from day to day, his anxiety increased, and the painter became unusually self-confident and verbose. On February 2, 1902, unsuccessful exposition of \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d in Moscow (the painter hoped that the painting would be bought for the Tretyakov Gallery) coincided with a suicide of [[Alexander Rizzoni]] following incorrect criticism in the \u201cMir isskusstva\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=408\u2014410}}\n\nThen the painting was brought to Saint Petersburg where Vrubel continued to constantly re-paint it. However, according to his friends, he only damaged it. Due to the painter\u2019s anxiety, his friends brought him to a famous psychiatrist [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] who diagnosed Vrubel with an ''incurable, progressive paralysis'' or [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]]. Mikhail Vrubel travelled to Moscow without knowing the diagnosis where his condition only worsened.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=412}} His painting was bought for 3 000 rubles by the famous collector {{ill|Vladimir von Meck|ru|\u0424\u043e\u043d \u041c\u0435\u043a\u043a, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. Judging by the correspondence between Nadezhda Zabela and Rimsky-Korsakov, Vrubel ''got crazy'', drank a lot, wasted money and quickly broke off for any reason. His wife and son tried to escape him and ran to relatives in Ryazan, but he followed them. At the beginning of April, Vrubel was hospitalized to a private hospital run by Savvy Magilevich.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=413}}\n\n== Disease. Dying (1903-1910) ==\n\n===The first crisis===\nVrubel\u2019s madness attracted the attention of the press; however, the reviews were mostly negative. For example, the newspaper ''Russian leaflet'' published the article \u201cMental Decadents\u201d that led to the official statement of denying. Soon, the established painters started to publish articles where they claimed that ''The Demon Downcast'' ''has something that needs to be in every true artistic composition''.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=414}} [[Alexandre Benois]] also changed his opinion on Vrubel\u2019 paintings; he even added an emotional passage about the ''true poetic nature''of Vrubel\u2019s paintings to his book \u201cHistory of Russian XIX century Art\u201d.{{sfn|\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430|1999|p=409}} Then, Benois and Diaghilev decided to prove Vrubel\u2019s sanity to the public, and in 1902 organized the exhibition of 36 works, including all three of his \u201cDemons\u201d. This exhibition was a tipping point in defining public attitudes to Vrubel\u2019s art; however, not many believed in his potential recovery. Authors of the articles in \u201cMir Isskustva\u201d even wrote about Vrubel in the past tense as if they had already summed up his artistic career.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}}\n\nFrom April to August 1902, Vrubel\u2019s mental health was indeed so bad that even his sister and wife were not allowed to visit him. He was wild and needed constant supervision. In the moments when the disease receded, he was able to speak coherently and attempted to paint. However, all his drawings from this period presented \u201cprimitive pornography\u201d. Additionally, his [[grandiose delusions]] also strengthened. One of the main symptoms of his disease was a constant desire to tore the cloth and underwear apart. In September 1902, Vrubel\u2019s condition had improved somewhat, and he even stopped bugging and drawing pornography became polite. Thus, it was decided to transfer him to the [[Serbsky Center]] at the Moscow University run by [[Vladimir Serbsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=414\u2014415}} In the clinic, Vrubel\u2019s health generally improved even though his family was still prohibited from visiting. The painter started writing to his wife, mostly in a self-deprecating tone. Serbsky confirmed the diagnosis \u201cprogressive paralysis due to syphilitic infection\u201d of Vladimir Bekhterev and even found out that the contamination took place in 1892. After Vrubel was prescribed with mercury drugs and sedatives, his behaviour became more predictable. Mikhail started to receive guests, including Vladimir von Meck and [[Pyotr Konchalovsky]]. However, the painter avoided conversations about art and was constantly gloomy. The only expected outcome was physical and mental [[wikt:degradation|degradation]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=418\u2014419}}\n\n=== Death of son. The second crisis ===\n[[File:Six-winged Seraph (Azrael). 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Six-winged Seraph, 1904. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nIn February 1903, Vrubel was discharged from the clinic. He was lethargic and absent-minded, all attempts to paint led to nothing. Doctors advised to send him to [[Crimea]], however, by April, his [[apathy]] transformed into a heavy depression and the painter had to return to Moscow. Vladimir von Meck suggested the Vrubel family spend the summer in his mansion in the [[Kiev Governorate]]. That somehow cheered Vrubel up and Nadezhda was happy as well. Right before the departure, a two-years-old Savva Vrubel got sick. In Kiev, his disease got stronger, and on May 3, the child died. Vrubel moved from apathy to grief, starting actively plan the funeral. He tried to look peppy and support his wife, who did not say a word.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}} Savva was buried in the [[Baikove Cemetery]]. After losing their only child, the spouses went to von Meck since they did not know what to do next and how to behave. In the mansion, Vrubel's mental health significantly worsened, and in a week he said categorically: \"please, put me somewhere; otherwise, I will do you trouble\". However, he was very afraid of the clinic at the [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|Saint Cyril\u2019s Monastery]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}\n\nFollowing the advice of close to them doctor Tilling, it was decided to bring the painter to [[Riga]] where he was assigned to the country institution. Vrubel was in a heavy depression and wanted to commit suicide for which he refused to take any food. Symptoms were quite different from the previous crisis \u2013 instead of grandiose illusions Vrubel experienced delusions of self-abasement and hallucinations. However, the local doctor did not confirm the diagnosis of Bekhterev and Serbsky, claiming that Vrubel is an artist in melancholy and he needs to work. Thus, Vrubel returned to his old work the \"Easter jungle\" which was re-painted to \"Azrail\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=434}} Nadezhda Vrubel wrote to Anna Vrubel that Mikhail is sleep-deprived and he is again not satisfied with the face which he redrew continuously. Work did not improve his mental health. In addition, the painter became so weak that he could only move in a wheelchair while the flu that he had led to a [[rheumatism]]. His family and friends thought that he would not survive the following spring. However, the painter survived and in the summer, following the Serbsky's advise, on July 9, 1904, Vrubel was put in the sanitary clinic of {{ill|Fedor Usoltsev|ru|\u0423\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435\u0432, \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in Petrovsky park.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=436}}\n\n=== Treatment in the Usoltsev's clinic.

At the same time, Vrubel\u2019s hallucinations were caused by a [[bipolar disorder]] common among artists.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=437}} Due to progressive methods applied in the Usoltsev's clinic and frequent visits of Nadezhda and Anna Vrubel (they rented a house nearby and visited Mikhail daily), Vrubel almost fully rehabilitated. Sometimes he was even released to spend several hours alone with his wife. The idea behind rehabilitation in the Usoltsev's clinic was that patients would feel themselves like at home \u2013 that is why the clinic was in the private house of doctor Usoltsev where he and his family lived together with the patients. The doctor constantly invited artists and singers for organized house concerts. Patients attended evening events together with medical staff{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}. Usoltsev valued Vrubel's art and in every possible way, encouraged his creative pursuits.

At that time, the painter primarily drew portraits of doctors, orderlies, patients, acquaintances, players in cards and chess, landscape sketches. He also sketched the corners of his room and some simple objects, such as chairs, a dress threw on a chair, a crumpled bed (seria \"Insomnia\"), candlestick, carafe, a rose in a glass. Perhaps, with coming back to art, he felt the need to \"study [[figure drawing]] hard and humbly\". Instead of stylization, the painter applied a \"naive transfer of the most detailed life impressions\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}} Among other, Vrubel painted doctor Usoltsev, his wife and a student brother. The unfinished portrait of doctor Usoltsev against a gilded icon has been preserved. The painter was able to reflect on the patterned texture of the background and highlights on the image with only one black pencil without any colours, and he \"saved\" the face in these small details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=116}}\n\nIn summer 1904, Nadezhda Zabela got an offer from the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. Since Vrubel could not imagine his life without her and doctor Usoltsev did not insist on his staying in the clinic; spouses moved to Saint Petersburg. Soon after that, Nadezhda realized that her voice lost its previous tonality due to experienced events. Thus, she could not anymore perform in the opera and eventually found herself in a [[chamber music]]. In that period, Vrubel painted a large number of her portraits depicting Nadezhda in different scenes. One of these paintings is a two-meter canvas \"After a concert\" that depicted Zabela in a dress created according to a Vrubel's design.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=442}}\n\n[[File:1905 Vrubel nach dem Konzert anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|\u201dAfter a concert\u201d, 1905.

A double issue of the journal \"Mir Isskustva\" (issue 10-11, 1903) was fully dedicated to Vrubel and his legacy. The issue published reproductions of his paintings and many critics publicly renounced their previously published negative reviews. One of the reasons for such a drastic change was recognition of [[impressionism]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] among European artistic circles. Thus, a particular symbolism, emotionality and figurativism of Vrubel' paintings came into fashion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=117\u2014118}}\n\n[[File:\u00ab\u0416\u0435\u043c\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430\u00bb.jpg|thumb|left|The Pearl Shell, 1904.

As with the illustrations for Lermontov' works, Vrubel created a lot of graphic sketches trying to catch and solve the problem of a \"black-white colourness\". However, the final version had the figures of sea princess on it, about which Vrubel later told to Prakhov:\n{{Quote|After all, I did not intend to paint any \"sea princesses\" in my \"Pearl\". I wanted to convey the drawing with all reality from which the game of pearl is constructed, and only after when I did several drawings with pencil and charcoal, I saw these princesses when I started to paint with colours\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}}}\n\nAt the same time, Dmitrieva did not appreciate this approach: \"figures that he unexpectedly for himself put in a pearl shell, hardly worthy of such a magical grotto. These cutesy figures are too reminiscent of their many long-haired sisters from a typical Art Nouveau decor; the artist himself vaguely felt it - he was not satisfied with his [[naiad]]s\".

Nadezhda summoned Usoltsev from Moscow to look after his patient. Mikhail Vrubel understood everything and did not resist. Before departure to Moscow on March 6, he started saying goodbye to his friends and relatives, came to see Pavel Chistyakov in the Academy of Arts and visited the Panaevsky Theatre where he saw his wife for the first time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=446}}\n\n===Last artistic activity===\n[[File:Vrubel Videnie proroka Iezekiilya 1906.jpg|thumb|The last Vrubel's painting \"The Vision of the Prophet Ezekiel\", 1906.

His sleep seemed to be a bit longer. He usually sleeps through the night for five hours, and a rare day so that he does not sleep at least three hours. He eats well and in due time.

However, his letters to Zabela are full of self-abasement and repentance. Despite the \"voices\" that tormented him, he returned to the theme of the Prophet, began to write the \"Six-winged Seraph\", and addressed the topic of vision of the Prophet [[Ezekiel]]. However, the painting remained unfinished since in the beginning of 1906, his vision started to drastically decrease proving the diagnosis of progressive paralysis. In addition, the painter was diagnosed with an [[optic neuropathy]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=449\u2014450}} Mikhail was kept in the clinic almost exclusively at the expense of his wife, which was not an easy task because a month of stay in the Usoltsev's clinic cost 100-150 rubles. On the contrary, the university clinic run by Serbsky costed only 9 rubles. The theatre administration understood the difficulty of Nadezhda's position. It kept her in the troupe on a salary of 3600 rubles per year that was sufficient enough to cover the expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=452}}\n\n[[File:Vrubel Bryusov.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Valery Bryusov, 1906.

The idea was to publish a series of portraits of famous contemporary writers. These portraits were supposed to be painted by the most acknowledged painters in the field. For instance, Serov was offered to paint [[Konstantin Balmont]]. Ryabushinsky paid 300 rubles for the portrait in advance and in addition bought  the [[self-portrait]] \u201cHead of Prophet\u201d for 100 rubles.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=451}} Bryusov later described the work on the portrait as follows:\n\n{{Quote|The door opened, and Vrubel came in.

After consulting with Usoltsev, it was decided to bring Vrubel back to Saint Petersburg since he did need any medical treatment only support from relatives and loved ones. Anna and Nadezhda settled in one apartment while Mikhail Vrubel was put in the excellent clinic run by doctor Konasevich where the painter celebrated his 50 years anniversary. However, the clinic was far away from home and had strict orders regarding the regime. Hence it was decided to transfer Vrubel to a hospital of Adolf Bari that was located on the 4-5 line of [[Vasilyevsky Island]] nearby the Academy of Arts and had a completely free regime.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=457}} Serov addressed the Academy of Arts with a request to pay Vrubel a monthly allowance that would cover some hospital expenses.

Nadezhda visited him regularly and sometimes even organized home concerts. Anna Vrubel visited brother daily, walked with him and read to him.

In severe February of 1910, he deliberately stood idle near with an open window and provoked pneumonia, which turned into a transient [[tuberculosis]]. At the same time, he retained his inherent aesthetics until the very last minute. Ekaterina Ge remembered that he \"took [[quinine]] almost with pleasure, and when he saw a [[sodium salicylate]], he said: \"This is so ugly\".

Hence he borrowed 25 rubles from me and left. He came back soon, took a large basin and a bucket of water, and poured some cologne from a beautiful bottle from  [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]]  into the water. He undressed and stood in a basin, pouring himself out of a bucket. Then he lighted the iron stove and put four eggs inside, and later ate them with a loaf of baked bread.

After the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] was severely damaged and many graves were destroyed. In the 1930s, a necropolis museum was organized in the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]]. Then they started to move the graves of famous artists from the Novodevichy Cemetery to a new museum, but the transfer remained unfinished due to lack of finance and later beginning of the [[World War II|war]].

According to Dmitrieva, his role was \u201cexclusive and separated\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} She did not consider Vrubel as a typical representative of Art Nouveau, mainly because he \"coincided with Art Nouveau in his far from best features\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} According to Dmitrieva, Art Nouveau was not organic enough for Vrubel, much less than it was for [[L\u00e9on Bakst]] or Valentin Serov since Vrubel followed the \"cult of a deep nature\" that was not \"modern\" in its nature.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=338}}\n\nAccording to {{ill|Vladimir Lenyashin|ru|\u041b\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0448\u0438\u043d, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, Mikhail Vrubel was able to implement [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] as a harmonious aesthetic and philosophical system in the visual arts. At the same time, as a creator, he was supposed to be alone making the evolution from \"hermit, alchemist, alien from another esoteric space\" to the prophet{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=10}}. P. Klimov, who deliberately considered Vrubel's art in the context of Russian Art Nouveau, recognized him as a representative of the revolutionary thread of the Russian modern. Klimov also noted that Vrubel's position and significance in that cultural environment were only comparable to the place of [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]] in [[neoclassicism]]. This was due to a combination of natural Vrubel's gift and his later familiarization with Russian artistic world in general.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=64}}\n\nKlimov suggested that Vrubel started to express specific features of Art Nouveau already in the paintings from the \"Kiev period\", such as stylization as the main principle of form interpretation, aspiration for synthesis, emphasis on the role of the silhouette, cold colouring, symbolism of mood.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}}\n\nRapid evolution in the Vrubel's style could be explained with his detachment from any mainstream artistic movements of that time, such as neoclassicism or Peredvizhniki. Hence, he did not try to overcome the doctrines. Vrubel perceived academism as a starting point for his own movement forward, as a combination of essential professional skills.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}} In terms of personality and artistic thinking, Mikhail was a pronounced individualist; he was alien to the ideas of social justice, collegiality or Orthodox unity that inspired other artists of his generation. Moreover, the loneliness of Vrubel can be purely explained by his social environment since being a bourgeois art form Art Nouveau in the 1880s had not yet had its followers in Russia.

Later, many moved into the Roman Empire, or settled west of the [[Carpathians]] near what is now [[Hungary]].\n\nA people called the ''Gutones''\u2014possibly early Goths\u2014are documented living near the lower [[Vistula River]] in the 1st century, where they are associated with the archaeological [[Wielbark culture]].<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/><ref name=\"Heather_ODLA\"/> In his book ''[[Getica]]'', the Gothic historian [[Jordanes]] claimed that the Goths originated in southern [[Scandinavia]] more than 1000 years earlier, but his reliability is disputed.<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/> The Wielbark culture expanded southwards towards the [[Black Sea]], where by the late 3rd century it contributed to the formation of the [[Chernyakhov culture]], which is associated with the Goths who were in frequent conflict and contact with the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/>{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}} By the 4th century at the latest, several groups were distinguishable, among whom the [[Thervingi]] and [[Greuthungi]] were the most powerful.{{sfn|Heather|2018|p=673}} During this time, [[Ulfilas]] began the [[Gothic Christianity|conversion]] of Goths to [[Arianism]].{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}}\n\nIn the late 4th century, the lands of the Goths were invaded from the east by the [[Huns]]. In the aftermath of this event, several groups of Goths came under Hunnic domination, while others migrated further west or sought refuge inside the Roman Empire. Goths who entered the empire by crossing the [[Danube]] inflicted a devastating defeat upon the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. These Goths would form the  [[Visigoths]], and under their king [[Alaric I]] they began a long migration, eventually establishing a [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in Spain at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Meanwhile, Goths under Hunnic rule gained their independence in the 5th century, most importantly the [[Ostrogoths]]. Under their king [[Theodoric the Great]], these Goths established an [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy at [[Ravenna]].{{sfn|Heather|2012|p=623}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic Kingdom was [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|destroyed]] by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the 6th century, while the Visigothic Kingdom was [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered]] by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the early 8th century. Remnants of Gothic communities in the [[Crimea]], known as the [[Crimean Goths]], lingered on for several centuries, although Goths would eventually cease to exist as a distinct people.{{sfn|Heather|2018|p=673}}{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}}\n\n==Name==\nThe origin and meaning of the term ''Goths'' is one of the most discussed topics in [[Germanic philology]].{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}}\n\nIn the [[Gothic language]], the Goths were called the *''[[:wiktionary:gut\u00feiuda|Gut-\u00feiuda]]'' \"Gothic people\" (attested as dative singular ''Gut-\u00feiudai'').{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}} Gutthiuda can also mean \"Land of the Gothic people\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The simplex variant of this name, *''Gutans'' (Goth), or possibly *''Gut\u00f4s'', is inferred from a presumed genitive plural form ''gutani'' in the [[Ring of Pietroassa#Inscription|Pietroassa inscription]].{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Brink|2002|p=688}}\n\nThe Gothic name is generally believed to have been first attested by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources in the 1st century AD in the form of ''Gutones'', which was applied to a people who at that time are recorded as living near the lower [[Vistula]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The name ''Gutones'' is certainly recorded by [[Pliny]] in the 1st century AD, and by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century AD.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} Pliny mentions that the 4th century BC traveler [[Pytheas]] reported a people called the ''Guiones'', while the early 1st century geographer [[Strabo]] mentions a people called the ''Butones'', and the late 1st century historian [[Tacitus]] mentions the ''Gotones''.{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} These names mentioned by Pytheas, Strabo and Tacitus are often equated with the name ''Gutones''.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=37-41}} ''Gutones'' may have meant \"young\" Goths or \"great\" Goths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} Ptolemy mentions not only the ''Gutones'', but also a people of [[Scandia]] called ''Goutai/Guti'', who are generally equated with the [[Geats]]/Gauts ({{lang-ang|g\u0113atas}};

The males and females of Kowalewko were found to be of significantly different origins, with males displaying closer links to Iron Age Scandinavia and carrying higher amounts of [[steppe ancestry]] and hunter-gatherer ancestry than the females.{{sfn|Stolarek|2018}}\n\nA genetic study published in Scientific Reports in 2019 examined the mtDNA of 27 Goths buried at a Wielbark cemetery in [[Mas\u0142om\u0119cz]] from the 2nd to the 4th centuries. They were found to be mostly carriers of haplogroup H and U. The individuals displayed even closer genetic links to Iron Age Scandinavian populations than did those of Kowalewko. Males and females at Mas\u0142om\u0119cz were found to be more closely related to each other than those at Kowalewko. They also carried fewer samples of U5b, and displayed fewer strong genetic links to the steppe populations than earlier Wielbark samples from Kowalewko. The results appeared to support the theory that the Goths originated in southern Scandinavia and expanded southwards through the Wielbark culture towards the [[Black Sea]], where they mixed with local populations and established the Chernyakhov culture.{{sfn|Stolarek|2019}}\n\nA genetic study published in ''Scientific Reports'' in 2019 examined the mtDNA of three Gothic females from the Chernyakhov culture. They carried haplogroup [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)#H1|H1n6]], H1c and [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T2g1]] respectively. The genetic makeup of these individuals differed significantly from that of previous populations of the area, being distinguished by showing a higher amount of ancestry from western and northern Europe. The results appeared to confirm the theory that the Chernyakhov culture emerged as a result of a Gothic migration from the north.{{sfn|J\u00e4rve|2019}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Art===\n{{See also|Migration Period art|Pietroasele Treasure|Ring of Pietroassa}}\n[[File:Ostgoten-fibel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An Ostrogothic eagle-shaped [[fibula (brooch)|fibula]], AD 500, Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nuremberg]]\nBefore the invasion of the Huns, the Gothic Chernyakhov culture produced jewelry, vessels, and decorative objects in a style much influenced by Greek and Roman craftsmen.

All other [[East Germanic languages]] are known, if at all, from proper names or [[De conviviis barbaris|short phrases]] that survived in historical accounts, and from loan-words in other languages. Gothic is known primarily from the [[Codex Argenteus]], a translation of the Bible.{{sfn|Pronk-Tiethoff|2013|pp=9-11}} The language was in decline by the mid-500s, due to the military victory of the Franks, the elimination of the Goths in Italy, and geographic isolation. In Spain the language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the Visigoths converted to Catholicism in 589.{{sfn|Pohl|Reimitz|1998|pp=119\u2013121}} The language survived as a domestic language in the Iberian peninsula (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) as late as the 8th century, and [[Franks|Frankish]] author [[Walafrid Strabo]] wrote that it was still spoken in the lower [[Danube]] area in the early 9th century.{{sfn|Pronk-Tiethoff|2013|pp=9-11}}\n\nIn pockets of the Crimea, a related dialect known as [[Crimean Gothic]] survived up until the early modern period, and the 4th-century Bible translation was in use there until at least the 9th century.<ref name=\"Nemalevich\">{{cite web |url=https://meduza.io/feature/2015/12/25/molitvy-na-kamnyah |url-access= |title=\u041c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u043d\u044f\u0445 |last1=Nemalevich |first1=Sergey |author-link1= |date=December 25, 2015 |orig-year= |editor-last1= |editor-first1= |editor1= |editor-link1= |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |editor2-link= |editors= |department= |website=[[Meduza]] |series= |publisher= |agency= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title= |type= |format= |bibcode= |doi= |isbn= |jstor= |archive-url= |archive-date= |url-status= |access-date=September 17, 2019 |via= |quote= |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n===Society===\n{{See|Palace of Omurtag}}\nArchaeological evidence in Visigothic cemeteries shows that social stratification was analogous to that of the village of [[Sabbas the Goth]]. The majority of villagers were common [[peasant]]s. Paupers were buried with funeral rites, unlike slaves. In a village of 50 to 100 people, there were four or five elite couples.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}} In Eastern Europe, houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall-houses. The largest known settlement is the [[Criuleni District]].{{sfn|Heather|Matthews|1991|pp=47-96}} Chernyakhov cemeteries feature both [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]] burials; among the latter the head aligned to the north. Some graves were left empty. Grave goods often include pottery, bone combs, and iron tools, but hardly ever weapons.{{sfn|Heather|Matthews|1991|pp=47-96}}\n\nPeter Heather suggests that the freemen constituted the core of Gothic society. These were ranked below the nobility, but above the [[freedmen]] and slaves.

They sowed wheat, barley, rye, and flax. They also raised pigs, poultry, and goats. Horses and donkeys were raised as working animals and fed with hay. Sheep were raised for their wool, which they fashioned into clothing. Archaeology indicates they were skilled potters and blacksmiths. When peace treaties were negotiated with the Romans, the Goths demanded free trade. Imports from Rome included wine and cooking-oil.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}}\n\n[[File:Bischof Ulfilas erkl\u00e4rt den Goten das Evangelium.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''Ulfilas explains the gospel to the Goths'', 1900]]\n\nRoman writers note that the Goths neither assessed [[taxes]] on their own people nor on their subjects.

Today, scholars identify this as a [[cultural movement]] called [[Gothicismus]], which included an enthusiasm for things [[Old Norse]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=23}}\n\nIn [[Spain in the Middle Ages|medieval]] and modern Spain, the Visigoths were believed to be the progenitors of the [[Spanish nobility]] (compare [[Gobineau]] for a similar French idea). By the early 7th century, the ethnic distinction between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans had all but disappeared, but recognition of a Gothic origin, e.g. on gravestones, still survived among the nobility. The 7th century Visigothic aristocracy saw itself as bearers of a particular Gothic consciousness and as guardians of old traditions such as Germanic namegiving; probably these traditions were on the whole restricted to the family sphere (Hispano-Roman nobles were doing service for Visigothic nobles already in the 5th century and the two branches of Spanish aristocracy had fully adopted similar customs two centuries later).{{sfn|Pohl|Reimitz|1998|pp=124\u2013126}}\n\nBeginning in 1278, when [[Magnus III of Sweden]] ascended to the throne, a reference to Gothic origins was included in the title of the King of Sweden: {{quote | We N.N. by the Grace of God King of the Swedes, the Goths and the Vends.}} In 1973, with the death of King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], the title was changed to simply \"King of Sweden.\"{{sfn|Luttwak|2009|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = In all history there is nothing more romantically marvellous than the swift rise of this people to the height of greatness, or than the suddenness and the tragic completeness of their ruin.{{sfn|Bradley|1888|p=3}}\n |author = \u2014 [[Henry Bradley]]\n |source = The Story of the Goths (1888)\n |align =\n |width = 18.5%\n}}\n\nThe Spanish and Swedish claims of Gothic origins led to a clash at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1434. Before the assembled [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and delegations could engage in theological discussion, they had to decide how to sit during the proceedings. The delegations from the more prominent nations argued that they should sit closest to the [[Pope]], and there were also disputes over who were to have the finest chairs and who were to have their chairs on mats. In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of the [[Diocese of V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths. The Spanish delegation retorted that it was only the \"lazy\" and \"unenterprising\" Goths who had remained in Sweden, whereas the \"heroic\" Goths had left Sweden, invaded the Roman empire and settled in Spain.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=2}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1896|pp=187\u2013195}}\n\nIn Spain, a man acting with arrogance would be said to be \"''haci\u00e9ndose los godos''\" (\"making himself to act like the Goths\").

Later, many moved into the Roman Empire, or settled west of the [[Carpathians]] near what is now [[Hungary]].\n\nA people called the ''Gutones''\u2014possibly early Goths\u2014are documented living near the lower [[Vistula River]] in the 1st century, where they are associated with the archaeological [[Wielbark culture]].<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/><ref name=\"Heather_ODLA\"/> In his book ''[[Getica]]'', the Gothic historian [[Jordanes]] claimed that the Goths originated in southern [[Scandinavia]] more than 1000 years earlier, but his reliability is disputed.<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/> The Wielbark culture expanded southwards towards the [[Black Sea]], where by the late 3rd century it contributed to the formation of the [[Chernyakhov culture]], which is associated with the Goths who were in frequent conflict and contact with the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/>{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}} By the 4th century at the latest, several groups were distinguishable, among whom the [[Thervingi]] and [[Greuthungi]] were the most powerful.{{sfn|Heather|2018|p=673}} During this time, [[Ulfilas]] began the [[Gothic Christianity|conversion]] of Goths to [[Arianism]].{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}}\n\nIn the late 4th century, the lands of the Goths were invaded from the east by the [[Huns]]. In the aftermath of this event, several groups of Goths came under Hunnic domination, while others migrated further west or sought refuge inside the Roman Empire. Goths who entered the empire by crossing the [[Danube]] inflicted a devastating defeat upon the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. These Goths would form the  [[Visigoths]], and under their king [[Alaric I]] they began a long migration, eventually establishing a [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in Spain at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Meanwhile, Goths under Hunnic rule gained their independence in the 5th century, most importantly the [[Ostrogoths]]. Under their king [[Theodoric the Great]], these Goths established an [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy at [[Ravenna]].{{sfn|Heather|2012|p=623}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic Kingdom was [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|destroyed]] by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the 6th century, while the Visigothic Kingdom was [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered]] by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the early 8th century. Remnants of Gothic communities in the [[Crimea]], known as the [[Crimean Goths]], lingered on for several centuries, although Goths would eventually cease to exist as a distinct people.{{sfn|Heather|2018|p=673}}{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}}\n\n==Name==\nThe origin and meaning of the term ''Goths'' is one of the most discussed topics in [[Germanic philology]].{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}}\n\nIn the [[Gothic language]], the Goths were called the *''[[:wiktionary:gut\u00feiuda|Gut-\u00feiuda]]'' \"Gothic people\" (attested as dative singular ''Gut-\u00feiudai'').{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}} Gutthiuda can also mean \"Land of the Gothic people\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The simplex variant of this name, *''Gutans'' (Goth), or possibly *''Gut\u00f4s'', is inferred from a presumed genitive plural form ''gutani'' in the [[Ring of Pietroassa#Inscription|Pietroassa inscription]].{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Brink|2002|p=688}}\n\nThe Gothic name is generally believed to have been first attested by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources in the 1st century AD in the form of ''Gutones'', which was applied to a people who at that time are recorded as living near the lower [[Vistula]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The name ''Gutones'' is certainly recorded by [[Pliny]] in the 1st century AD, and by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century AD.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} Pliny mentions that the 4th century BC traveler [[Pytheas]] reported a people called the ''Guiones'', while the early 1st century geographer [[Strabo]] mentions a people called the ''Butones'', and the late 1st century historian [[Tacitus]] mentions the ''Gotones''.{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} These names mentioned by Pytheas, Strabo and Tacitus are often equated with the name ''Gutones''.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=37-41}} ''Gutones'' may have meant \"young\" Goths or \"great\" Goths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} Ptolemy mentions not only the ''Gutones'', but also a people of [[Scandia]] called ''Goutai/Guti'', who are generally equated with the [[Geats]]/Gauts ({{lang-ang|g\u0113atas}}; {{lang-non|gautar}}; {{lang-sv|g\u00f6tar}}) of southern [[Sweden]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}}{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} After Ptolemy, the Gothic name is not attested again until the late 3rd century, when the name ''Goths'' ({{lang-la|Gothi}}) is explicitly recorded for the first time for a group of peoples living north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} Although no ancient sources make a connection between the names ''Gutones'' and ''Goths'',{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} this connection is nevertheless generally accepted among modern scholars.<ref name=\"Heather_115\"/> The name ''gutani'' is attested in the Pietroassa inscription, and probably reflects a form of the Gothic endonym *''Gutans''.{{sfn|Brink|2008|p=104}}{{sfn|Brink|2002|p=688}} The Geats/Gauts are recorded in the 6th century by [[Procopius]] and [[Jordanes]] as the ''Gautoi'' and ''Gauthigoths'' respectively.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}}\n\nThe names ''Gutones'' and ''Goths'' in [[Proto-Germanic]] are both *''Gutaniz'' (singular *''[[:wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/gut\u00f4|Gut\u00f4]]''), which is identical to that of the [[Gutes]] (Old Norse: ''gutnar''; Swedish: ''gutar''), who are natives of the island of [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Brink|2008|pp=90, 110}}{{sfn|Andersson|1996|pp=5-21}}{{sfn|Brink|2002|p=688}} A basic [[Word stem|stem]] of both ''Gutones'', ''Goths'', *''Gutans'' and ''Gutthiuda'' is ''gut-''.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} ''Gut-'' is generally thought to be related to the Gothic term *''[[:wiktionary:giutan|giutan]]'', which means \"to pour\".{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The stem ''gut-'' is also found in the names of [[G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv]] of [[G\u00f6taland]] (homeland of the Geats/Gauts), the river [[:wiktionary:Guthalus|Guthalus]] of [[Germania]] mentioned by Pliny, and in the name of [[Gaut]], who was considered the mythical ancestor of the Geats/Gauts.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The more specific stem for ''Gutones'', ''Goths'', *''Gutans'', ''Gut-thiuda'' and ''Gutes'' is *''Gutan'', while the corresponding stem for ''Geats''/''Gauts'' is *''Gauta''.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}} Both  are doubtlessly related to the Proto-Germanic verb *''[[:wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/geutan\u0105|geuta-]]'', which means \"to pour\".{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Brink|2008|pp=90, 110}}{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2004|pp=44-47}} This Proto-Germanic verb is in turn derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root [[:wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/\u01f5\u02b0ewd-|*''*\u01f5\u02b0ewd-'']], which also means \"to pour\".{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|p=156}} Rather than being derived from *''Gauta'', *''Gutan'' probably has a common origin and the same meaning as it.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}} The Proto-Germanic form of the name ''Geats''/''Gauts'' is *''Gautoz'' (singular *''[[:wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/gautaz|Gautaz]]'').{{sfn|Brink|2008|pp=90, 110}}{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} *''Gutaniz'' and *''Gautoz'' corresponds exactly to the Old Norse names ''gutnar'' and ''gautar'', which referred to the Gutes and Geats/Gauts respectively.

Imports from Rome included wine and cooking-oil.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}}\n\n[[File:Bischof Ulfilas erkl\u00e4rt den Goten das Evangelium.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''Ulfilas explains the gospel to the Goths'', 1900]]\n\nRoman writers note that the Goths neither assessed [[taxes]] on their own people nor on their subjects. The early 5th century Christian writer [[Salvian]] compared the Goths' and related people's favourable treatment of the poor to the miserable state of peasants in [[Roman Gaul]]:\n<blockquote>\nFor in the Gothic country the barbarians are so far from tolerating this sort of oppression that not even Romans who live among them have to bear it. Hence all the Romans in that region have but one desire, that they may never have to return to the Roman jurisdiction. It is the unanimous prayer of the Roman people in that district that they may be permitted to continue to lead their present life among the barbarians.{{sfn|Kristinsson|2010|p=172}}\n</blockquote>\n\n===Religion===\n{{See|Gothic paganism|Gothic persecution of Christians|Gothic Christianity}}\nInitially practising [[Gothic paganism]], the Goths were gradually converted to [[Arianism]] in the course of the 4th century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=79\u201380}} According to [[Basil of Caesarea]], a prisoner named Eutychus taken captive in a raid on Cappadocia in 260 preached the gospel to the Goths and was martyred.{{sfn|Cassia|2019|p=22}} It was only in the 4th as a result of missionary activity by the Gothic bishop [[Ulfilas]], whose grandparents were Cappadocians taken captive in the raids of the 250s,{{sfn|Cassia|2019|p=22}} that the Goths were gradually converted.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=79\u201380}} Ulfilas devised a [[Gothic alphabet]] and translated the [[Gothic Bible]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nDuring the 370s, Goths converting to Christianity were subject to [[Gothic persecution of Christians|persecution]] by the Thervingian king Athanaric, who was a pagan.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=64\u201372}}\n\nThe Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania converted to Roman Catholicism in the late 6th&nbsp;Century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=371}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths (and their remnants, the Crimean Goths) were closely connected to the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] from the 5th century, and became fully incorporated under the [[Metropolitanate of Gothia]] from the 9th century.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1936|pp=117\u2013135}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Estatua de Don Pelayo en Covadonga, Asturias.jpg|thumb|In Spain, the Visigothic nobleman [[Pelagius of Asturias]] who founded the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and began the [[Reconquista]] at the [[Battle of Covadonga]], is a national hero regarded as the country's first monarch.]]\n{{See|Reconquista|Gothicism}}\nThe Goths' relationship with Sweden became an important part of [[Swedish nationalism]], and until the 19th&nbsp;Century, before the Gothic origin had been thoroughly researched by archaeologists, Swedish scholars considered Swedes to be the direct descendants of the Goths. Today, scholars identify this as a [[cultural movement]] called [[Gothicismus]], which included an enthusiasm for things [[Old Norse]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=23}}\n\nIn [[Spain in the Middle Ages|medieval]] and modern Spain, the Visigoths were believed to be the progenitors of the [[Spanish nobility]] (compare [[Gobineau]] for a similar French idea). By the early 7th century, the ethnic distinction between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans had all but disappeared, but recognition of a Gothic origin, e.g. on gravestones, still survived among the nobility. The 7th century Visigothic aristocracy saw itself as bearers of a particular Gothic consciousness and as guardians of old traditions such as Germanic namegiving; probably these traditions were on the whole restricted to the family sphere (Hispano-Roman nobles were doing service for Visigothic nobles already in the 5th century and the two branches of Spanish aristocracy had fully adopted similar customs two centuries later).{{sfn|Pohl|Reimitz|1998|pp=124\u2013126}}\n\nBeginning in 1278, when [[Magnus III of Sweden]] ascended to the throne, a reference to Gothic origins was included in the title of the King of Sweden: {{quote | We N.N. by the Grace of God King of the Swedes, the Goths and the Vends.}} In 1973, with the death of King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], the title was changed to simply \"King of Sweden.\"{{sfn|Luttwak|2009|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = In all history there is nothing more romantically marvellous than the swift rise of this people to the height of greatness, or than the suddenness and the tragic completeness of their ruin.{{sfn|Bradley|1888|p=3}}\n |author = \u2014 [[Henry Bradley]]\n |source = The Story of the Goths (1888)\n |align =\n |width = 18.5%\n}}\n\nThe Spanish and Swedish claims of Gothic origins led to a clash at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1434. Before the assembled [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and delegations could engage in theological discussion, they had to decide how to sit during the proceedings. The delegations from the more prominent nations argued that they should sit closest to the [[Pope]], and there were also disputes over who were to have the finest chairs and who were to have their chairs on mats. In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of the [[Diocese of V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths. The Spanish delegation retorted that it was only the \"lazy\" and \"unenterprising\" Goths who had remained in Sweden, whereas the \"heroic\" Goths had left Sweden, invaded the Roman empire and settled in Spain.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=2}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1896|pp=187\u2013195}}\n\nIn Spain, a man acting with arrogance would be said to be \"''haci\u00e9ndose los godos''\" (\"making himself to act like the Goths\"). In [[Chile]], [[Argentina]] and the [[Canary Islands]], ''godo'' was an [[ethnic slur]] used against European Spaniards, who in the early colonial period often felt superior to the people born locally (''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|criollos]]'').{{sfn|Bell|1993|p=67}}\n\nA large amount of literature has been produced on the Goths, with [[Henry Bradley]]'s ''The Goths'' (1888) being the standard English-language text for many decades.
