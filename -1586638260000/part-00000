Diamond argues that the gaps in power and technology between human societies originate primarily in environmental differences, which are amplified by various [[positive feedback|positive feedback loops]]. When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, [[written language]] or the development among Eurasians of resistance to [[endemic disease]]s), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian [[genome]]s.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe prologue opens with an account of Diamond's conversation with [[Yali (politician)|Yali]], a [[Papua New Guinea|New Guinean]] politician. The conversation turned to the obvious differences in power and technology between Yali's people and the [[Europeans]] who dominated the land for 200 years, differences that neither of them considered due to any genetic superiority of Europeans. Yali asked, using the local term \"[[Cargo cult|cargo]]\" for inventions and manufactured goods, \"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\" (p.&nbsp;14)\n\nDiamond realized the same question seemed to apply elsewhere: \"People of Eurasian origin ... dominate ... the world in wealth and power.\" Other peoples, after having thrown off colonial domination, still lag in wealth and power. Still others, he says, \"have been decimated, subjugated, and in some cases even exterminated by European colonialists.\" (p.&nbsp;15)\n\nThe peoples of other continents ([[sub-Saharan Africans]], [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[New Guineans]], and the original inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia) have been largely conquered, displaced and in some extreme cases \u2013 referring to Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians, and South Africa's indigenous [[Khoisan]] peoples \u2013 largely exterminated by farm-based societies such as Eurasians and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]. He believes this is due to these societies' technological and immunological advantages, stemming from the early rise of agriculture after the last [[Ice Age]].\n\n=== Title ===\nThe book's title is a reference to the means by which farm-based societies conquered populations of other areas and maintained dominance, despite sometimes being vastly outnumbered \u2013 superior weapons provided immediate military superiority ([[guns]]); Eurasian diseases weakened and reduced local populations, who had no immunity, making it easier to maintain control over them ([[Microorganism|germs]]); and durable means of transport ([[Infrastructure|steel]]) enabled imperialism.\n\nDiamond argues geographic, climatic and environmental characteristics which favored early development of stable [[Agrarian society|agricultural societies]] ultimately led to immunity to diseases endemic in agricultural animals and the development of powerful, organized [[State (polity)|states]] capable of dominating others.\n\n=== Outline of theory ===\nDiamond argues that Eurasian [[civilization]] is not so much a product of ingenuity, but of opportunity and necessity. That is, civilization is not created out of superior intelligence, but is the result of a chain of developments, each made possible by certain preconditions.\n\nThe first step towards civilization is the move from [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]] to rooted agrarian society. Several conditions are necessary for this transition to occur: access to high-carbohydrate vegetation that endures storage; a [[climate]] dry enough to allow storage; and access to animals docile enough for [[domestication]] and versatile enough to survive captivity. Control of [[crops]] and livestock leads to food [[Excess supply|surpluses]]. Surpluses free people to specialize in activities other than sustenance and support population growth. The combination of specialization and population growth leads to the accumulation of social and technological innovations which build on each other. Large societies develop [[ruling class]]es and supporting [[bureaucracies]], which in turn lead to the organization of [[nation-state]]s and empires.<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\">{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W. Norton & Company | date=March 1997 | isbn=978-0-393-03891-0 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough agriculture arose in several parts of the world, Eurasia gained an early advantage due to the greater availability of suitable plant and animal species for domestication. In particular, Eurasia has [[barley]], two varieties of wheat, and three protein-rich [[pulse (legume)|pulses]] for food; [[flax]] for textiles; and goats, sheep, and cattle. Eurasian grains were richer in protein, easier to sow, and easier to store than American maize or tropical bananas.\n\nAs early Western Asian civilizations began to trade, they found additional useful animals in adjacent territories, most notably horses and [[donkey]]s for use in transport. Diamond identifies 13 species of large animals over {{convert|100|lb}} domesticated in Eurasia, compared with just one in South America (counting the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] as breeds within the same species) and none at all in the rest of the world. Australia and North America suffered from a lack of useful animals due to [[extinction]], probably by human hunting, shortly after the end of the [[Pleistocene]], whilst the only [[Domestication of animals|domesticated animals]] in [[New Guinea]] came from the East Asian mainland during the [[Austronesian]] settlement some 4,000\u20135,000 years ago. Biological relatives of the horse, including [[zebra]]s and [[onager]]s, proved untameable; and although [[African elephant]]s can be tamed, it is very difficult to breed them in captivity;<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\" /><ref name=\"McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond\" /> Diamond describes the small number of domesticated species (14 out of 148 \"candidates\") as an instance of the [[Anna Karenina principle]]: many promising species have just one of several significant difficulties that prevent domestication. He also makes the argument that all large mammals that could be domesticated, have been.{{R|Diamond1997GGS|pages=168\u2013174}}\n\nEurasians domesticated goats and sheep for hides, clothing, and cheese; cows for milk; [[ox|bullocks]] for [[tillage]] of fields and transport; and benign animals such as pigs and chickens. Large domestic animals such as horses and camels offered the considerable military and economic advantages of mobile transport.\n\n[[File:Continental axes by Jared Diamond.png|thumb|[[Continent]]al axes according to [[Jared Diamond]] in ''Guns, Germs, and Steel''.]]\n\nEurasia's large landmass and long east-west distance increased these advantages. Its large area provided it with more plant and animal species suitable for domestication, and allowed its people to exchange both innovations and diseases. Its east-west orientation allowed breeds domesticated in one part of the continent to be used elsewhere through similarities in climate and the cycle of seasons. The Americas had difficulty adapting crops domesticated at one [[latitude]] for use at other latitudes (and, in North America, adapting crops from one side of the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the other). Similarly, Africa was fragmented by its extreme variations in climate from north to south: crops and animals that flourished in one area never reached other areas where they could have flourished, because they could not survive the intervening environment. Europe was the ultimate beneficiary of Eurasia's east-west orientation: in the [[first millennium BCE]], the [[Mediterranean]] areas of Europe adopted Southwestern Asia's animals, plants, and agricultural techniques; in the [[first millennium]] CE, the rest of Europe followed suit.<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\" /><ref name=\"McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond\" />\n\nThe plentiful supply of food and the dense populations that it supported made [[division of labor]] possible. The rise of non-farming specialists such as craftsmen and [[scribe]]s accelerated economic growth and technological progress. These economic and technological advantages eventually enabled Europeans to conquer the peoples of the other continents in recent centuries by using the guns and steel of the book's title.\n\nEurasia's dense populations, high levels of trade, and living in close proximity to livestock resulted in widespread transmission of diseases, including from animals to humans. [[Smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[influenza]] were the result of close proximity between dense populations of animals and humans.  [[Natural selection]] forced Eurasians to develop [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to a wide range of [[pathogen]]s.

Threats posed by immediate neighbors ensured governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were out-competed relatively quickly, whilst the region's leading powers changed over time. Other advanced cultures developed in areas whose geography was conducive to large, monolithic, isolated empires, without competitors that might have forced the nation to reverse mistaken policies such as China [[Haijin|banning the building of ocean-going ships]]. Western Europe also benefited from a more temperate climate than Southwestern Asia where intense agriculture ultimately damaged the environment, encouraged [[desertification]], and hurt [[soil fertility]].\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n[[File:Jared Diamond's big five.jpg|thumb|The \"big five\"]]\n''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' argues that [[urbanization|cities]] require an ample supply of food, and thus are dependent on agriculture. As farmers do the work of providing food, division of labor allows others freedom to pursue other functions, such as mining and literacy.\n\nThe crucial trap for the development of agriculture is the availability of wild edible plant species suitable for domestication. Farming arose early in the [[Fertile Crescent]] since the area had an abundance of wild wheat and pulse species that were nutritious and easy to domesticate. In contrast, American farmers had to struggle to develop corn as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor, [[teosinte]].\n\nAlso important to the transition from hunter-gatherer to city-dwelling agrarian societies was the presence of 'large' domesticable animals, raised for meat, work, and long-distance communication. Diamond identifies a mere 14 domesticated large mammal species worldwide. The five most useful (cow, horse, sheep, goat, and pig) are all descendants of species [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to [[Eurasia]]. Of the remaining nine, only two (the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] both of South America) are indigenous to a land outside the temperate region of Eurasia.\n\nDue to the [[Anna Karenina principle]], surprisingly few animals are suitable for domestication. Diamond identifies six criteria including the animal being sufficiently docile, gregarious, willing to breed in captivity and having a social dominance hierarchy. Therefore, none of the many African mammals such as the zebra, [[antelope]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[African elephant]] were ever domesticated (although some can be tamed, they are not easily bred in captivity). The [[Holocene extinction event]] eliminated many of the [[megafauna]] that, had they survived, might have become candidate species, and [[Holocene extinction event#North America|Diamond argues]] that the pattern of extinction is more severe on continents where animals that had no prior experience of humans were exposed to humans who already possessed advanced hunting techniques (e.g. the Americas and Australia).\n\nSmaller domestic-able animals such as dogs, cats, chickens, and [[guinea pig]]s may be valuable in various ways to an agricultural society, but will not be adequate in themselves to sustain large-scale agrarian society. An important example is the use of larger animals such as cattle and horses in plowing land, allowing for much greater crop productivity and the ability to farm a much wider variety of land and soil types than would be possible solely by human muscle power. Large domestic animals also have an important role in the transportation of goods and people over long distances, giving the societies that possess them considerable military and economic advantages.\n\n=== Geography ===\nDiamond also argues that geography shaped [[Migration (human)|human migration]], not simply by making travel difficult (particularly by latitude), but by how climates affect where domesticable animals can easily travel and where crops can ideally grow easily due to the sun.\n\nThe dominant [[Out of Africa theory]] holds that modern humans developed east of the [[Great Rift Valley]] of the African continent at one time or another. The [[Sahara]] kept people from migrating north to the Fertile Crescent, until later when the [[Nile River]] valley became accommodating.\n\nDiamond continues to describe the story of human development up to the modern era, through the rapid development of technology, and its dire consequences on hunter-gathering cultures around the world.\n\nDiamond touches on why the dominant powers of the last 500 years have been West European rather than East Asian (especially Chinese). The Asian areas in which big civilizations arose had geographical features conducive to the formation of large, stable, isolated empires which faced no external pressure to change which led to stagnation. Europe's many [[natural barrier]]s allowed the development of competing nation-states. Such competition forced the European nations to encourage innovation and avoid technological stagnation.\n\n=== Germs ===\nIn the later context of the [[European colonization of the Americas]], 95% of the indigenous populations are believed to have been [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|killed off by diseases]] brought by the Europeans. Many were killed by infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. Similar circumstances were observed in [[History of Australia (1788\u20131850)|Australia]] and [[History of South Africa|South Africa]]. Aboriginal Australians and the Khoikhoi population were decimated by smallpox, measles, influenza and other diseases.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blainey|first1=Geoffrey|title=A short history of the world|url=https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofwo00blai|url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=Dee|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1566635073}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Smallpox Epidemic Strikes at the Cape|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/smallpox-epidemic-strikes-cape|website=South Africa History Online|date=16 March 2011|access-date=April 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428140710/https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/smallpox-epidemic-strikes-cape|archive-date=April 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHow was it then that diseases native to the American continents did not kill off Europeans? Diamond posits that most of these diseases were only developed and sustained in large dense populations in villages and cities; he also states most epidemic diseases evolve from similar diseases of domestic animals. The combined effect of the increased population densities supported by agriculture, and of close human proximity to domesticated animals leading to animal diseases infecting humans, resulted in European societies acquiring a much richer collection of dangerous pathogens to which European people had acquired immunity through [[natural selection]] (see the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics) during a longer time than was the case for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[hunter-gatherers]] and farmers.\n\nHe mentions the tropical diseases (mainly [[malaria]]) that limited European penetration into Africa as an exception. Endemic infectious diseases were also barriers to European colonisation of Southeast Asia and New Guinea.\n\n=== Success and failure ===\n''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' focuses on why some populations succeeded. His later book, ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', focuses on environmental and other factors that have caused some populations to fail.\n\n== Intellectual background ==\nIn the 1930s, the [[Annales School]] in France undertook the study of [[Longue dur\u00e9e|long-term historical structures]] by using a synthesis of geography, history, and sociology. Scholars examined the impact of geography, climate, and land use. Although geography had been nearly eliminated as an academic discipline in the United States after the 1960s, several geography-based historical theories were published in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Cohen1998GeographyRedux\">{{cite news| title= Geography Redux: Where You Live Is What You Are | newspaper = The New York Times | date=March 21, 1998 | author=Cohen, P. | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D81738F932A15750C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | accessdate = 2008-07-09 }}</ref>\n\nThe relation between disease, immunity and European colonization of the Americas was first developed by Alfred Crosby. According to Paul Kelton in Epidemics and Enslavement (Nebraska, 2007), \"Crosby has offered the most extensive work on the role of epidemic disease in facilitating European conquest.

''[[The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal]]'' (part four).\n\n== Reception ==\nThe reception of ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' by academics has been mixed.\n\nMany have praised the book for its synthesis of different subjects, but note that the large scope of the work will inevitably lead to some inaccuracies and oversimplifications. International Relations scholars [[Iver B. Neumann]] (of the London School of Economics and Political Science) and Einar Wigen (of University of Oslo) use ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' as a foil for their own inter-disciplinary work. They write that \"while empirical details should, of course, be correct, the primary yardstick for this kind of work cannot be attention to detail.\" They state, \"Diamond stated clearly that any problematique of this magnitude had to be radically multi-causal and then set to work on one complex of factors, namely ecological ones\", and note that while Diamond \"immediately came in for heavy criticism from specialists working in the disparate fields on which he drew.... Until somebody can come up with a better way of interpreting and adding to Diamond\u2019s material with a view to understanding the same overarching problematique, his is the best treatment available of the ecological preconditions for why one part of the world, and not another, came to dominate.\"<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Introduction|last=Wigen|first=Einar|last2=Neumann|first2=Iver B.|date=2018|website=The Steppe Tradition in International Relations: Russians, Turks and European State Building 4000 BCE\u20132017 CE|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=en|doi=10.1017/9781108355308.003|url-status=live|title=The Steppe Tradition in International Relations|pages=1\u201325|isbn=9781108355308}}</ref> In a review of ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' that ultimately commended the book, historian Tom Tomlinson wrote, \"Given the magnitude of the task he has set himself, it is inevitable that Professor Diamond uses very broad brush-strokes to fill in his argument.\"<ref name=\"Tomlinson1998GGSreview\">{{cite web|date = May 1998|url = http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/diamond.html|title = Review:Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies|publisher = Institute of Historical Research|accessdate = 2008-03-14|last = Tom Tomlinson|quote = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210040/http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/diamond.html|archive-date = September 27, 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nEmory University historian Tonio Andrade writes that Diamond's book \"may not satisfy professional historians on all counts\" but that it \"does make a bold and compelling case for the different developments that occurred in the Old World versus the New (he is less convincing in his attempts to separate Africa from Eurasia).\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Andrade|first=Tonio|date=2010-01-01|title=Beyond Guns, Germs, and Steel: European Expansion and Maritime Asia, 1400-1750|journal=Journal of Early Modern History|language=en|volume=14|issue=1\u20132|pages=165\u2013186|doi=10.1163/138537810X12632734397142|issn=1385-3783}}</ref> Another historian, professor [[J.

Diamond argues that the gaps in power and technology between human societies originate primarily in environmental differences, which are amplified by various [[positive feedback|positive feedback loops]]. When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, [[written language]] or the development among Eurasians of resistance to [[endemic disease]]s), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian [[genome]]s.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe prologue opens with an account of Diamond's conversation with [[Yali (politician)|Yali]], a [[Papua New Guinea|New Guinean]] politician. The conversation turned to the obvious differences in power and technology between Yali's people and the [[Europeans]] who dominated the land for 200 years, differences that neither of them considered due to any genetic superiority of Europeans. Yali asked, using the local term \"[[Cargo cult|cargo]]\" for inventions and manufactured goods, \"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\" (p.&nbsp;14)\n\nDiamond realized the same question seemed to apply elsewhere: \"People of Eurasian origin ... dominate ... the world in wealth and power.\" Other peoples, after having thrown off colonial domination, still lag in wealth and power. Still others, he says, \"have been decimated, subjugated, and in some cases even exterminated by European colonialists.\" (p.&nbsp;15)\n\nThe peoples of other continents ([[sub-Saharan Africans]], [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[New Guineans]], and the original inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia) have been largely conquered, displaced and in some extreme cases \u2013 referring to Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians, and South Africa's indigenous [[Khoisan]] peoples \u2013 largely exterminated by farm-based societies such as Eurasians and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]. He believes this is due to these societies' technological and immunological advantages, stemming from the early rise of agriculture after the last [[Ice Age]].\n\n=== Title ===\nThe book's title is a reference to the means by which farm-based societies conquered populations of other areas and maintained dominance, despite sometimes being vastly outnumbered \u2013 superior weapons provided immediate military superiority ([[guns]]); Eurasian diseases weakened and reduced local populations, who had no immunity, making it easier to maintain control over them ([[Microorganism|germs]]); and durable means of transport ([[Infrastructure|steel]]) enabled imperialism.\n\nDiamond argues geographic, climatic and environmental characteristics which favored early development of stable [[Agrarian society|agricultural societies]] ultimately led to immunity to diseases endemic in agricultural animals and the development of powerful, organized [[State (polity)|states]] capable of dominating others.\n\n=== Outline of theory ===\nDiamond argues that Eurasian [[civilization]] is not so much a product of ingenuity, but of opportunity and necessity. That is, civilization is not created out of superior intelligence, but is the result of a chain of developments, each made possible by certain preconditions.\n\nThe first step towards civilization is the move from [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]] to rooted agrarian society. Several conditions are necessary for this transition to occur: access to high-carbohydrate vegetation that endures storage; a [[climate]] dry enough to allow storage; and access to animals docile enough for [[domestication]] and versatile enough to survive captivity. Control of [[crops]] and livestock leads to food [[Excess supply|surpluses]]. Surpluses free people to specialize in activities other than sustenance and support population growth. The combination of specialization and population growth leads to the accumulation of social and technological innovations which build on each other. Large societies develop [[ruling class]]es and supporting [[bureaucracies]], which in turn lead to the organization of [[nation-state]]s and empires.<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\">{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W.

In particular, Eurasia has [[barley]], two varieties of wheat, and three protein-rich [[pulse (legume)|pulses]] for food; [[flax]] for textiles; and goats, sheep, and cattle. Eurasian grains were richer in protein, easier to sow, and easier to store than American maize or tropical bananas.\n\nAs early Western Asian civilizations began to trade, they found additional useful animals in adjacent territories, most notably horses and [[donkey]]s for use in transport. Diamond identifies 13 species of large animals over {{convert|100|lb}} domesticated in Eurasia, compared with just one in South America (counting the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] as breeds within the same species) and none at all in the rest of the world. Australia and North America suffered from a lack of useful animals due to [[extinction]], probably by human hunting, shortly after the end of the [[Pleistocene]], whilst the only [[Domestication of animals|domesticated animals]] in [[New Guinea]] came from the East Asian mainland during the [[Austronesian]] settlement some 4,000\u20135,000 years ago. Biological relatives of the horse, including [[zebra]]s and [[onager]]s, proved untameable; and although [[African elephant]]s can be tamed, it is very difficult to breed them in captivity;<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\" /><ref name=\"McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond\" /> Diamond describes the small number of domesticated species (14 out of 148 \"candidates\") as an instance of the [[Anna Karenina principle]]: many promising species have just one of several significant difficulties that prevent domestication. He also makes the argument that all large mammals that could be domesticated, have been.{{R|Diamond1997GGS|pages=168\u2013174}}\n\nEurasians domesticated goats and sheep for hides, clothing, and cheese; cows for milk; [[ox|bullocks]] for [[tillage]] of fields and transport; and benign animals such as pigs and chickens. Large domestic animals such as horses and camels offered the considerable military and economic advantages of mobile transport.\n\n[[File:Continental axes by Jared Diamond.png|thumb|[[Continent]]al axes according to [[Jared Diamond]] in ''Guns, Germs, and Steel''.]]\n\nEurasia's large landmass and long east-west distance increased these advantages. Its large area provided it with more plant and animal species suitable for domestication, and allowed its people to exchange both innovations and diseases. Its east-west orientation allowed breeds domesticated in one part of the continent to be used elsewhere through similarities in climate and the cycle of seasons. The Americas had difficulty adapting crops domesticated at one [[latitude]] for use at other latitudes (and, in North America, adapting crops from one side of the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the other). Similarly, Africa was fragmented by its extreme variations in climate from north to south: crops and animals that flourished in one area never reached other areas where they could have flourished, because they could not survive the intervening environment. Europe was the ultimate beneficiary of Eurasia's east-west orientation: in the [[first millennium BCE]], the [[Mediterranean]] areas of Europe adopted Southwestern Asia's animals, plants, and agricultural techniques; in the [[first millennium]] CE, the rest of Europe followed suit.<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\" /><ref name=\"McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond\" />\n\nThe plentiful supply of food and the dense populations that it supported made [[division of labor]] possible. The rise of non-farming specialists such as craftsmen and [[scribe]]s accelerated economic growth and technological progress. These economic and technological advantages eventually enabled Europeans to conquer the peoples of the other continents in recent centuries by using the guns and steel of the book's title.\n\nEurasia's dense populations, high levels of trade, and living in close proximity to livestock resulted in widespread transmission of diseases, including from animals to humans. [[Smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[influenza]] were the result of close proximity between dense populations of animals and humans.  [[Natural selection]] forced Eurasians to develop [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to a wide range of [[pathogen]]s. When Europeans made contact with the Americas, European diseases (to which Americans had no immunity) ravaged the indigenous American population, rather than the other way around (the \"trade\" in diseases was a little more balanced in Africa and southern Asia: endemic malaria and [[yellow fever]] made these regions notorious as the \"white man's grave\";<ref name=\"RossMacGregor1903 offightAgainstMalaria\">{{cite journal\n|title = The Fight against Malaria: An Industrial Necessity for Our African Colonies |author1=Ross, R. |author2=MacGregor, W. |journal=Journal of the Royal African Society |volume=2 |issue=6 |date=January 1903 |pages=149\u2013160 |jstor=714548 }}</ref> and [[syphilis]] may have originated in the Americas).{{NoteTag|The origin of syphilis is still debated.

Threats posed by immediate neighbors ensured governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were out-competed relatively quickly, whilst the region's leading powers changed over time. Other advanced cultures developed in areas whose geography was conducive to large, monolithic, isolated empires, without competitors that might have forced the nation to reverse mistaken policies such as China [[Haijin|banning the building of ocean-going ships]]. Western Europe also benefited from a more temperate climate than Southwestern Asia where intense agriculture ultimately damaged the environment, encouraged [[desertification]], and hurt [[soil fertility]].\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n[[File:Jared Diamond's big five.jpg|thumb|The \"big five\"]]\n''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' argues that [[urbanization|cities]] require an ample supply of food, and thus are dependent on agriculture. As farmers do the work of providing food, division of labor allows others freedom to pursue other functions, such as mining and literacy.\n\nThe crucial trap for the development of agriculture is the availability of wild edible plant species suitable for domestication. Farming arose early in the [[Fertile Crescent]] since the area had an abundance of wild wheat and pulse species that were nutritious and easy to domesticate. In contrast, American farmers had to struggle to develop corn as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor, [[teosinte]].\n\nAlso important to the transition from hunter-gatherer to city-dwelling agrarian societies was the presence of 'large' domesticable animals, raised for meat, work, and long-distance communication. Diamond identifies a mere 14 domesticated large mammal species worldwide. The five most useful (cow, horse, sheep, goat, and pig) are all descendants of species [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to [[Eurasia]]. Of the remaining nine, only two (the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] both of South America) are indigenous to a land outside the temperate region of Eurasia.\n\nDue to the [[Anna Karenina principle]], surprisingly few animals are suitable for domestication. Diamond identifies six criteria including the animal being sufficiently docile, gregarious, willing to breed in captivity and having a social dominance hierarchy. Therefore, none of the many African mammals such as the zebra, [[antelope]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[African elephant]] were ever domesticated (although some can be tamed, they are not easily bred in captivity). The [[Holocene extinction event]] eliminated many of the [[megafauna]] that, had they survived, might have become candidate species, and [[Holocene extinction event#North America|Diamond argues]] that the pattern of extinction is more severe on continents where animals that had no prior experience of humans were exposed to humans who already possessed advanced hunting techniques (e.g. the Americas and Australia).\n\nSmaller domestic-able animals such as dogs, cats, chickens, and [[guinea pig]]s may be valuable in various ways to an agricultural society, but will not be adequate in themselves to sustain large-scale agrarian society. An important example is the use of larger animals such as cattle and horses in plowing land, allowing for much greater crop productivity and the ability to farm a much wider variety of land and soil types than would be possible solely by human muscle power. Large domestic animals also have an important role in the transportation of goods and people over long distances, giving the societies that possess them considerable military and economic advantages.\n\n=== Geography ===\nDiamond also argues that geography shaped [[Migration (human)|human migration]], not simply by making travel difficult (particularly by latitude), but by how climates affect where domesticable animals can easily travel and where crops can ideally grow easily due to the sun.\n\nThe dominant [[Out of Africa theory]] holds that modern humans developed east of the [[Great Rift Valley]] of the African continent at one time or another. The [[Sahara]] kept people from migrating north to the Fertile Crescent, until later when the [[Nile River]] valley became accommodating.\n\nDiamond continues to describe the story of human development up to the modern era, through the rapid development of technology, and its dire consequences on hunter-gathering cultures around the world.\n\nDiamond touches on why the dominant powers of the last 500 years have been West European rather than East Asian (especially Chinese). The Asian areas in which big civilizations arose had geographical features conducive to the formation of large, stable, isolated empires which faced no external pressure to change which led to stagnation. Europe's many [[natural barrier]]s allowed the development of competing nation-states. Such competition forced the European nations to encourage innovation and avoid technological stagnation.\n\n=== Germs ===\nIn the later context of the [[European colonization of the Americas]], 95% of the indigenous populations are believed to have been [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|killed off by diseases]] brought by the Europeans. Many were killed by infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. Similar circumstances were observed in [[History of Australia (1788\u20131850)|Australia]] and [[History of South Africa|South Africa]]. Aboriginal Australians and the Khoikhoi population were decimated by smallpox, measles, influenza and other diseases.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blainey|first1=Geoffrey|title=A short history of the world|url=https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofwo00blai|url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=Dee|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1566635073}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Smallpox Epidemic Strikes at the Cape|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/smallpox-epidemic-strikes-cape|website=South Africa History Online|date=16 March 2011|access-date=April 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428140710/https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/smallpox-epidemic-strikes-cape|archive-date=April 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHow was it then that diseases native to the American continents did not kill off Europeans? Diamond posits that most of these diseases were only developed and sustained in large dense populations in villages and cities; he also states most epidemic diseases evolve from similar diseases of domestic animals. The combined effect of the increased population densities supported by agriculture, and of close human proximity to domesticated animals leading to animal diseases infecting humans, resulted in European societies acquiring a much richer collection of dangerous pathogens to which European people had acquired immunity through [[natural selection]] (see the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics) during a longer time than was the case for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[hunter-gatherers]] and farmers.\n\nHe mentions the tropical diseases (mainly [[malaria]]) that limited European penetration into Africa as an exception. Endemic infectious diseases were also barriers to European colonisation of Southeast Asia and New Guinea.\n\n=== Success and failure ===\n''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' focuses on why some populations succeeded. His later book, ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', focuses on environmental and other factors that have caused some populations to fail.\n\n== Intellectual background ==\nIn the 1930s, the [[Annales School]] in France undertook the study of [[Longue dur\u00e9e|long-term historical structures]] by using a synthesis of geography, history, and sociology. Scholars examined the impact of geography, climate, and land use. Although geography had been nearly eliminated as an academic discipline in the United States after the 1960s, several geography-based historical theories were published in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Cohen1998GeographyRedux\">{{cite news| title= Geography Redux: Where You Live Is What You Are | newspaper = The New York Times | date=March 21, 1998 | author=Cohen, P. | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D81738F932A15750C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | accessdate = 2008-07-09 }}</ref>\n\nThe relation between disease, immunity and European colonization of the Americas was first developed by Alfred Crosby.

''[[The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal]]'' (part four).\n\n== Reception ==\nThe reception of ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' by academics has been mixed.\n\nMany have praised the book for its synthesis of different subjects, but note that the large scope of the work will inevitably lead to some inaccuracies and oversimplifications. International Relations scholars [[Iver B. Neumann]] (of the London School of Economics and Political Science) and Einar Wigen (of University of Oslo) use ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' as a foil for their own inter-disciplinary work. They write that \"while empirical details should, of course, be correct, the primary yardstick for this kind of work cannot be attention to detail.\" They state, \"Diamond stated clearly that any problematique of this magnitude had to be radically multi-causal and then set to work on one complex of factors, namely ecological ones\", and note that while Diamond \"immediately came in for heavy criticism from specialists working in the disparate fields on which he drew.... Until somebody can come up with a better way of interpreting and adding to Diamond\u2019s material with a view to understanding the same overarching problematique, his is the best treatment available of the ecological preconditions for why one part of the world, and not another, came to dominate.\"<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Introduction|last=Wigen|first=Einar|last2=Neumann|first2=Iver B.|date=2018|website=The Steppe Tradition in International Relations: Russians, Turks and European State Building 4000 BCE\u20132017 CE|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=en|doi=10.1017/9781108355308.003|url-status=live|title=The Steppe Tradition in International Relations|pages=1\u201325|isbn=9781108355308}}</ref> In a review of ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' that ultimately commended the book, historian Tom Tomlinson wrote, \"Given the magnitude of the task he has set himself, it is inevitable that Professor Diamond uses very broad brush-strokes to fill in his argument.\"<ref name=\"Tomlinson1998GGSreview\">{{cite web|date = May 1998|url = http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/diamond.html|title = Review:Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies|publisher = Institute of Historical Research|accessdate = 2008-03-14|last = Tom Tomlinson|quote = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210040/http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/diamond.html|archive-date = September 27, 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nEmory University historian Tonio Andrade writes that Diamond's book \"may not satisfy professional historians on all counts\" but that it \"does make a bold and compelling case for the different developments that occurred in the Old World versus the New (he is less convincing in his attempts to separate Africa from Eurasia).\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Andrade|first=Tonio|date=2010-01-01|title=Beyond Guns, Germs, and Steel: European Expansion and Maritime Asia, 1400-1750|journal=Journal of Early Modern History|language=en|volume=14|issue=1\u20132|pages=165\u2013186|doi=10.1163/138537810X12632734397142|issn=1385-3783}}</ref> Another historian, professor [[J.

Europeans become inadvertent, accidental conquerors. Natives succumb passively to their fate.\" He added, \"Jared Diamond has done a huge disservice to the telling of human history.

Instead, the author concludes that because there was no sophisticated division of labor, private property rights, and monetary exchange, societies like that on Easter Island could never progress from the nomadic stage to a complex society.

Typically, after welding, the properties near the weld are those of 6061-T4, a loss of strength of around 40%. The material can be re-heat-treated to restore near -T6 temper for the whole piece. After welding, the material can naturally age and restore some of its strength as well. Most strength is recovered in the first few days to a few weeks. Nevertheless, the Aluminum Design Manual (Aluminum Association) recommends the design strength of the material adjacent to the weld to be taken as 165 MPa/24000 PSI without proper heat treatment after the welding. Typical filler material is 4043 or 5356.\n\n=== Extrusions ===\n6061 is an alloy used in the production of [[extrusion]]s\u2014long constant\u2013cross-section structural shapes produced by pushing metal through a shaped [[die (manufacturing)|die]].\n\n=== Forgings ===\n6061 is an alloy that is suitable for hot [[forging]]. The billet is heated through an [[induction furnace]] and forged using a closed die process. This particular alloy is suitable for open die forgings. Automotive parts, ATV parts, and industrial parts are just some of the uses as a forging. Aluminum 6061 can be forged into flat or round bars, rings, blocks, discs and blanks, hollows, and spindles. 6061 can be forged into special and custom shapes.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 6061 Aluminum Alloy Forging {{!}} Anderson Shumaker|url = http://www.andersonshumaker.com/materials/aluminum/6061-aluminum.html|website = www.andersonshumaker.com|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}</ref>\n\n===Castings===\n\n6061 is not an alloy that is traditionally cast due to its low silicon content affecting the fluidity in casting. It can be suitably cast using a specialized [[Centrifugal casting (industrial)|centrifugal casting]] method. Centrifugally cast 6061 is ideal for larger rings and sleeve applications that exceed limitations of most wrought offerings. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://johnsoncentrifugal.com/aluminum-alloys/|title=Aluminum Alloys {{!}} Johnson Centrifugal|website=johnsoncentrifugal.com|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref>\n\n== Standards ==\nDifferent forms and tempers of 6061 aluminum alloy are discussed in the following standards:<ref>[http://www.makeitfrom.com/material-properties/6061-3.3214-H20-A96061-Aluminum/ 6061 (3.3214, H20, A96061) Aluminum].

Typically, after welding, the properties near the weld are those of 6061-T4, a loss of strength of around 40%. The material can be re-heat-treated to restore near -T6 temper for the whole piece. After welding, the material can naturally age and restore some of its strength as well. Most strength is recovered in the first few days to a few weeks. Nevertheless, the Aluminum Design Manual (Aluminum Association) recommends the design strength of the material adjacent to the weld to be taken as 165 MPa/24000 PSI without proper heat treatment after the welding. Typical filler material is 4043 or 5356.\n\n=== Extrusions ===\n6061 is an alloy used in the production of [[extrusion]]s\u2014long constant\u2013cross-section structural shapes produced by pushing metal through a shaped [[die (manufacturing)|die]].\n\n=== Forgings ===\n6061 is an alloy that is suitable for hot [[forging]]. The billet is heated through an [[induction furnace]] and forged using a closed die process. This particular alloy is suitable for open die forgings. Automotive parts, ATV parts, and industrial parts are just some of the uses as a forging. Aluminum 6061 can be forged into flat or round bars, rings, blocks, discs and blanks, hollows, and spindles. 6061 can be forged into special and custom shapes.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 6061 Aluminum Alloy Forging {{!}} Anderson Shumaker|url = http://www.andersonshumaker.com/materials/aluminum/6061-aluminum.html|website = www.andersonshumaker.com|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}</ref>\n\n===Castings===\n\n6061 is not an alloy that is traditionally cast due to its low silicon content affecting the fluidity in casting.

Class I devices include simple devices such as arm slings and hand-held [[surgical instruments]]. Class II devices are considered to need more regulation than Class I devices and are required to undergo specific requirements before FDA approval. Class II devices include X-ray systems and physiological monitors. Class III devices require the most regulatory controls since the device supports or sustains human life or may not be well tested. Class III devices include replacement [[heart valves]] and implanted [[Cerebellum|cerebellar]] stimulators. Many implants typically fall under Class II and Class III devices.<ref name=\"SyringOver03\">{{cite web |url=http://www.qrasupport.com/FDA_MED_DEVICE.html |title=Overview: FDA Regulation of Medical Devices |author=Syring, G. |publisher=Quality and Regulatory Associates, LLC |date=6 May 2003 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"FDAClassify\">{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/ClassifyYourDevice/ |title=Classify Your Medical Device |work=FDA.gov/MedicalDevices |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |date=29 July 2014 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Materials==\n{{Expand section|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Commonly implanted metals===\nA variety of minimally bioreactive metals are implanted.  The most commonly implanted form of stainless steel is 316L, and for long-term implants, cobalt-chromium and titanium-based implant alloys are also used.  All of these are [[Passivation_(chemistry)|made passive]] by a thin layer of oxide on their surface. Stainless steel remains subject to corrosion, and is therefore only used for temporary implants, while \nthe titanium and [[cobalt-chrome]] alloys can be implanted indefinitely.  A consideration, however, is that metal ions do diffuse outward through the oxide, and end up in the surrounding tissue.  Bioreaction to metal implants includes the formation of a small envelope of fibrous tissue.  The thickness of this layer is determined by the products being dissolved, and the extent to which the implant moves around within the enclosing tissue.  Pure titanium, a preferred implant material, may have only a minimal fibrous encapsulation.  Stainless steel, on the other hand, may elicit encapsulation of as much as 2 mm.<ref name=\"Charmetals\">{{cite journal|pmid=9440845 |title=Characteristics of metals used in implants |last1=Gotman |first1=I. |journal=Journal of Endourology |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=383\u2013389 |doi=10.1089/end.1997.11.383 |date=December 1997 }}</ref>\n\n==Complications==\n[[File:Ruptured implant.JPG|thumb|300px|Complications can arise from implant failure. Internal rupturing of a breast implant can lead to bacterial infection, for example.]]\nUnder ideal conditions, implants should initiate the desired [[host response]]. Ideally, the implant should not cause any undesired reaction from neighboring or distant tissues. However, the interaction between the implant and the tissue surrounding the implant can lead to complications.<ref name=\"WongBio12\" /> The process of implantation of medical devices is subjected to the same complications that other invasive medical procedures can have during or after surgery. Common complications include [[infection]], [[inflammation]], and [[pain]]. Other complications that can occur include risk of [[Transplant rejection|rejection]] from implant-induced [[coagulation]] and [[Foreign body response|allergic foreign body response]]. Depending on the type of implant, the complications may vary.<ref name=\"WongBio12\" />\n\nWhen the site of an implant becomes infected during or after surgery, the surrounding tissue becomes infected by [[microorganisms]]. Three main categories of infection can occur after operation. Superficial immediate infections are caused by organisms that commonly grow near or on skin. The infection usually occurs at the surgical opening. Deep immediate infection, the second type, occurs immediately after surgery at the site of the implant. Skin-dwelling and airborne [[bacteria]] cause deep immediate infection. These bacteria enter the body by attaching to the implant's surface prior to implantation. Though not common, deep immediate infections can also occur from dormant bacteria from previous infections of the tissue at the implantation site that have been activated from being disturbed during the surgery. The last type, late infection, occurs months to years after the implantation of the implant. Late infections are caused by dormant [[blood-borne]] bacteria attached to the implant prior to implantation. The blood-borne bacteria colonize on the implant and eventually get released from it. Depending on the type of material used to make the implant, it may be infused with [[antibiotic]]s to lower the risk of infections during surgery. However, only certain types of materials can be infused with antibiotics, the use of antibiotic-infused implants runs the risk of rejection by the patient since the patient may develop a sensitivity to the antibiotic, and the antibiotic may not work on the bacteria.<ref name=\"BlackBio06\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kDLx3mKm1EC&printsec=frontcover |title=Biological Performance of Materials: Fundamentals of Biocompatibility |author=Black, J. |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |year=2006 |pages=520 |isbn=9780849339592 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nInflammation, a common occurrence after any surgical procedure, is the body's response to tissue damage as a result of trauma, infection, intrusion of foreign materials, or local [[cell death]], or as a part of an [[Immune system|immune response]]. Inflammation starts with the rapid dilation of local [[Capillary|capillaries]] to supply the local tissue with blood. The inflow of blood causes the tissue to become swollen and may cause cell death. The excess blood, or edema, can activate pain receptors at the tissue. The site of the inflammation becomes warm from local disturbances of fluid flow and the increased cellular activity to repair the tissue or remove debris from the site.<ref name=\"BlackBio06\" />\n\nImplant-induced coagulation is similar to the [[Coagulation#Physiology|coagulation process]] done within the body to prevent blood loss from damaged blood vessels. However, the coagulation process is triggered from [[protein]]s that become attached to the implant surface and lose their shapes. When this occurs, the protein changes conformation and different activation sites become exposed, which may trigger an immune system response where the body attempts to attack the implant to remove the foreign material. The trigger of the immune system response can be accompanied by inflammation. The immune system response may lead to chronic inflammation where the implant is rejected and has to be removed from the body. The immune system may encapsulate the implant as an attempt to remove the foreign material from the site of the tissue by encapsulating the implant in [[fibrinogen]] and [[platelet]]s. The encapsulation of the implant can lead to further complications, since the thick layers of fibrous encapsulation may prevent the implant from performing the desired functions. Bacteria may attack the fibrous encapsulation and become embedded into the fibers. Since the layers of fibers are thick, antibiotics may not be able to reach the bacteria and the bacteria may grow and infect the surrounding tissue. In order to remove the bacteria, the implant would have to be removed. Lastly, the immune system may accept the presence of the implant and repair and remodel the surrounding tissue. Similar responses occur when the body initiates an allergic foreign body response. In the case of an allergic foreign body response, the implant would have to be removed.<ref name=\"DeeAnIntro02\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KEXVyjO8KQIC&printsec=frontcover |title=An Introduction to Tissue-Biomaterial Interactions |author1=Dee, K.C. |author2=Puleo, D.A. |author3=Bizios, R. |publisher=Wiley-Liss |location=Hoboken, NJ |year=2002 |pages=248 |isbn=9780471461128 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Failures==\n{{main|Implant failure}}\nThe many examples of [[implant failure]] include [[Breast implant#Implant rupture|rupture]] of silicone [[breast implant]]s, [[hip replacement]] joints, and [[artificial heart valves]], such as the [[Bjork\u2013Shiley valve]], all of which have caused FDA intervention.

According to 21CFR 860.3, Class I devices are considered to pose the least amount of risk to the user and require the least amount of control. Class I devices include simple devices such as arm slings and hand-held [[surgical instruments]]. Class II devices are considered to need more regulation than Class I devices and are required to undergo specific requirements before FDA approval. Class II devices include X-ray systems and physiological monitors. Class III devices require the most regulatory controls since the device supports or sustains human life or may not be well tested. Class III devices include replacement [[heart valves]] and implanted [[Cerebellum|cerebellar]] stimulators. Many implants typically fall under Class II and Class III devices.<ref name=\"SyringOver03\">{{cite web |url=http://www.qrasupport.com/FDA_MED_DEVICE.html |title=Overview: FDA Regulation of Medical Devices |author=Syring, G. |publisher=Quality and Regulatory Associates, LLC |date=6 May 2003 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"FDAClassify\">{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/ClassifyYourDevice/ |title=Classify Your Medical Device |work=FDA.gov/MedicalDevices |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |date=29 July 2014 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Materials==\n{{Expand section|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Commonly implanted metals===\nA variety of minimally bioreactive metals are implanted.  The most commonly implanted form of stainless steel is 316L, and for long-term implants, cobalt-chromium and titanium-based implant alloys are also used.  All of these are [[Passivation_(chemistry)|made passive]] by a thin layer of oxide on their surface. Stainless steel remains subject to corrosion, and is therefore only used for temporary implants, while \nthe titanium and [[cobalt-chrome]] alloys can be implanted indefinitely.  A consideration, however, is that metal ions do diffuse outward through the oxide, and end up in the surrounding tissue.  Bioreaction to metal implants includes the formation of a small envelope of fibrous tissue.  The thickness of this layer is determined by the products being dissolved, and the extent to which the implant moves around within the enclosing tissue.  Pure titanium, a preferred implant material, may have only a minimal fibrous encapsulation.  Stainless steel, on the other hand, may elicit encapsulation of as much as 2 mm.<ref name=\"Charmetals\">{{cite journal|pmid=9440845 |title=Characteristics of metals used in implants |last1=Gotman |first1=I. |journal=Journal of Endourology |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=383\u2013389 |doi=10.1089/end.1997.11.383 |date=December 1997 }}</ref>\n\n==Complications==\n[[File:Ruptured implant.JPG|thumb|300px|Complications can arise from implant failure. Internal rupturing of a breast implant can lead to bacterial infection, for example.]]\nUnder ideal conditions, implants should initiate the desired [[host response]]. Ideally, the implant should not cause any undesired reaction from neighboring or distant tissues. However, the interaction between the implant and the tissue surrounding the implant can lead to complications.<ref name=\"WongBio12\" /> The process of implantation of medical devices is subjected to the same complications that other invasive medical procedures can have during or after surgery. Common complications include [[infection]], [[inflammation]], and [[pain]]. Other complications that can occur include risk of [[Transplant rejection|rejection]] from implant-induced [[coagulation]] and [[Foreign body response|allergic foreign body response]]. Depending on the type of implant, the complications may vary.<ref name=\"WongBio12\" />\n\nWhen the site of an implant becomes infected during or after surgery, the surrounding tissue becomes infected by [[microorganisms]]. Three main categories of infection can occur after operation. Superficial immediate infections are caused by organisms that commonly grow near or on skin. The infection usually occurs at the surgical opening. Deep immediate infection, the second type, occurs immediately after surgery at the site of the implant. Skin-dwelling and airborne [[bacteria]] cause deep immediate infection. These bacteria enter the body by attaching to the implant's surface prior to implantation. Though not common, deep immediate infections can also occur from dormant bacteria from previous infections of the tissue at the implantation site that have been activated from being disturbed during the surgery. The last type, late infection, occurs months to years after the implantation of the implant. Late infections are caused by dormant [[blood-borne]] bacteria attached to the implant prior to implantation. The blood-borne bacteria colonize on the implant and eventually get released from it. Depending on the type of material used to make the implant, it may be infused with [[antibiotic]]s to lower the risk of infections during surgery. However, only certain types of materials can be infused with antibiotics, the use of antibiotic-infused implants runs the risk of rejection by the patient since the patient may develop a sensitivity to the antibiotic, and the antibiotic may not work on the bacteria.<ref name=\"BlackBio06\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kDLx3mKm1EC&printsec=frontcover |title=Biological Performance of Materials: Fundamentals of Biocompatibility |author=Black, J. |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |year=2006 |pages=520 |isbn=9780849339592 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nInflammation, a common occurrence after any surgical procedure, is the body's response to tissue damage as a result of trauma, infection, intrusion of foreign materials, or local [[cell death]], or as a part of an [[Immune system|immune response]]. Inflammation starts with the rapid dilation of local [[Capillary|capillaries]] to supply the local tissue with blood. The inflow of blood causes the tissue to become swollen and may cause cell death. The excess blood, or edema, can activate pain receptors at the tissue. The site of the inflammation becomes warm from local disturbances of fluid flow and the increased cellular activity to repair the tissue or remove debris from the site.<ref name=\"BlackBio06\" />\n\nImplant-induced coagulation is similar to the [[Coagulation#Physiology|coagulation process]] done within the body to prevent blood loss from damaged blood vessels. However, the coagulation process is triggered from [[protein]]s that become attached to the implant surface and lose their shapes. When this occurs, the protein changes conformation and different activation sites become exposed, which may trigger an immune system response where the body attempts to attack the implant to remove the foreign material. The trigger of the immune system response can be accompanied by inflammation. The immune system response may lead to chronic inflammation where the implant is rejected and has to be removed from the body. The immune system may encapsulate the implant as an attempt to remove the foreign material from the site of the tissue by encapsulating the implant in [[fibrinogen]] and [[platelet]]s. The encapsulation of the implant can lead to further complications, since the thick layers of fibrous encapsulation may prevent the implant from performing the desired functions. Bacteria may attack the fibrous encapsulation and become embedded into the fibers. Since the layers of fibers are thick, antibiotics may not be able to reach the bacteria and the bacteria may grow and infect the surrounding tissue. In order to remove the bacteria, the implant would have to be removed. Lastly, the immune system may accept the presence of the implant and repair and remodel the surrounding tissue. Similar responses occur when the body initiates an allergic foreign body response. In the case of an allergic foreign body response, the implant would have to be removed.<ref name=\"DeeAnIntro02\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KEXVyjO8KQIC&printsec=frontcover |title=An Introduction to Tissue-Biomaterial Interactions |author1=Dee, K.C. |author2=Puleo, D.A. |author3=Bizios, R. |publisher=Wiley-Liss |location=Hoboken, NJ |year=2002 |pages=248 |isbn=9780471461128 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Failures==\n{{main|Implant failure}}\nThe many examples of [[implant failure]] include [[Breast implant#Implant rupture|rupture]] of silicone [[breast implant]]s, [[hip replacement]] joints, and [[artificial heart valves]], such as the [[Bjork\u2013Shiley valve]], all of which have caused FDA intervention.
