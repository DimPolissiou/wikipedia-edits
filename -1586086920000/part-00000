His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nHowever, Piper broke up soon after and Squier, the band's frontman, signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in the spring of 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (also known for his stints with [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling about 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in a 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned to team with [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]], who had recently produced Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania''. However, Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs - a rather odd choice for straight-forward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> ''Signs of Life'' finally came in September 1984 and brought Squier his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. The album saw him melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; on some occasions he played for half empty stadiums during the Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans. Squier removed the video from MTV's rotation, but the damage was already done.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued performing and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, playing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the strongest inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return anymore after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critic and audience reception was mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton.

In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years.

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nHowever, Piper broke up soon after and Squier, the band's frontman, signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in the spring of 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (also known for his stints with [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling about 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in a 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned to team with [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]], who had recently produced Def Leppard's wildly succesful ''Pyromania''. However, Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs - a rather odd choice for straight-forward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> ''Signs of Life'' finally came in September 1984 and brought Squier his third consecutive platinum certifaction. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. The album saw him melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; on some occasions he played for half empty stadiums during the Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans. Squier removed the video from MTV's rotation, but the damage was already done.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued performing and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, playing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the strongest inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return anymore after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critic and audience reception was mixed; many critized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years. It was released in collaboration with Squier, who provided two live bonus cuts from his personal collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staticmultimedia.com/music/news/shout~_factory_re-issuing_concrete_blonde_~_billy_squier|title=Shout!

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews. He also supported the Group for the East End and its native planting programs on eastern Long Island.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Post|date=May 14, 2000|url=https://nypost.com/2000/05/14/rocker-billys-a-country-squier/|title=Rocker Billy's A Country \u2018Squier\u2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=New York Social Diary|date=September 2, 2015|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/guest-diary/2015/end-of-summer-doings-at-madoo|title=End of Summer Doings at Madoo}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Billy Squier discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n*''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Emotions in Motion]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Happy Blue (Billy Squier album)|Happy Blue]]'' (1998)\n\n===Non-album soundtrack contributions===\n*''Fast Times (The Best Years Of Our Lives)'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Fast Times At Ridgemont High]]'' (1982)\n*''On Your Own'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1984)\n*''Shake Down'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<!--unused<ref name=\"parker\">{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Lyndsey|title=Martha, Martha, Martha! 35 Years Later, Original VJ Quinn Remembers MTV's Early Days|url=https://www.yahoo.com/music/martha-martha-martha-35-years-later-original-vj-quinn-remembers-mtvs-early-days-042906236.html|website=Yahoo!

Both he and Garvey were immigrants to the United States from Caribbean islands who had a vision of Pan-African goals.\n\nIn addition McGuire was known for his other religious contributions. Already a minister in the [[Moravian Church]] when he immigrated in 1894 to the US, McGuire soon joined the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]]. He was ordained in 1897 as an Episcopal [[priest]]. An early member of the American Negro Historical Society in Philadelphia, McGuire became more concerned about developing institutions that supported persons of African ancestry. In 1921 McGuire founded the [[African Orthodox Church]] (AOC); and he was consecrated that year as its first bishop, serving until his death in 1934. During his tenure, new congregations were started in several cities in the US, Canada, the Caribbean, and in East Africa.\n\nMcGuire envisioned the AOC as a home for Blacks of [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] belief who wanted ecclesiastical independence. It was based on [[Sacred tradition|Christian tradition]] and [[Apostolic succession]].<ref>Mead, Frank S. ''Handbook of Denominations in the United States.'' 10th edition. Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1995. pp.128-129.</ref> Orthodoxy attracted persons of African descent because it had not been implicated in colonialism or slavery.<ref name=MARTIN/>\n\n==Life==\n\nGeorge McGuire was born to an Afro-Caribbean family on 28 March 1866 in [[Swetes]], [[Antigua]]. He studied in local grammar schools, then at the Antigua branch of [[Mico College]] for teachers. He also studies at the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] Miskey Seminary in the [[Danish West Indies]]. From 1888 to 1894 McGuire served as pastor of a [[Moravian Church]] in the Danish West Indies.\n\n==Episcopal Church USA==\nIn 1894, McGuire immigrated to the United States. He initially joined the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], which was the first independent black denomination in the country, founded in the early nineteenth century. On 2 January 1895, McGuire formally joined the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], and two years later he was ordained as a priest.\n\nMcGuire was called to lead small, mostly black Episcopal churches in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; [[Richmond, Virginia]]; and [[Philadelphia]]. St. Philip's Episcopal Church of Richmond, Virginia lists \"Reverend George Alexander McQuire\" as rector from April 1898 to November 1900. After McGuire's tenure, the Rev. [[Raphael Morgan|Robert Josias \"Raphael\" Morgan]] was listed as the rector there from \"1901-April 1901\", likely acting on an interim basis until a full-time rector was called. The two men may have known each other. Morgan was later known as Fr. Raphael when he was ordained in 1907 as an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest.\n\nBy 1901 McGuire was appointed rector of [[African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas|St. Thomas' Episcopal Church in Philadelphia]]; this was the first black congregation in the Episcopal Church. Saint Thomas served the African-American elite of Philadelphia. It had been started in 1794 by [[Absalom Jones]], earlier a founder with [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]] of the [[Free African Society]]. This mutual aid society preceded the African Methodist Episcopal Church founded by Allen.<ref name=MARTIN>Tony Martin.

Cary D. Wintz, Paul Finkelman (Eds.). Taylor & Francis, 2004. p.776.</ref> McGuire was rector of St. Thomas from 1902-05.\n\nHe was succeeded as rector there by A.C.V. Cartier (1906\u201312). Cartier later followed Fr. Raphael Morgan in his interest in the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 1908 Fr Raphael recommended Cartier to the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]] for Orthodox ordination.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1909, McGuire served as Archdeacon for Colored Work in the [[Episcopal Diocese of Arkansas|Diocese of Arkansas]]. He was the church's highest-ranking African American and the first to achieve the rank of [[Archdeacon#Anglican Communion|Archdeacon]]. He worked to increase the number of missions in the state from one to nine. He encountered opposition from the local Episcopal bishop, who believed blacks should be segregated from whites and placed in their own church jurisdiction. Following the Reconstruction era, Arkansas and other southern states had imposed legal racial segregation in most public and private facilities. At the turn of the century, Arkansas and other former Confederate states effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most black citizens]] by raising barriers to voter registration.\n\nEventually McGuire resigned and moved North to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. There he established St. Bartholomew's Church for West Indians who were living in the Boston area. While in Cambridge, McGuire also studied at Boston College of Physicians and Surgeons, receiving his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree in 1910.<ref>''[http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6s235cs College of Physicians and Surgeons (Boston, Mass.)].'' Social Networks and Archival Context (SNAC). Retrieved: 10 February 2017.</ref> When his small church was not recognized by the Episcopal diocese, McGuire resigned in 1911. As he traveled across the U.S., he became more discouraged, believing that blacks did not have opportunities to advance in the Episcopal Church, and decided to leave it.\n\n==Return to Antigua==\n\nIn 1913 McGuire returned to the West Indies, settling in British-controlled [[Antigua and Barbuda|Antigua]] to care for his sick mother. While there he volunteered at a local parish, serving as a minister in the Church of England. He gained acclaim for practicing medicine on the island. When a strike of local [[sugar cane]] workers led to rioting and burning of the sugar cane fields, British colonial officials urged local and religious leaders to oppose the strikes, but McGuire refused and urged official to ensure that workers were paid decent, living wages.\n\n==UNIA==\n\nMcGuire returned to the United States in 1918 and soon afterward joined the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|UNIA]]. [[Marcus Garvey]], a Jamaican immigrant and the president and founder of UNIA, appointed him as first [[Chaplain]]-General of the organization, at its inaugural international convention in New York in August 1920. In this position McGuire wrote two important documents of UNIA, \"Universal Negro Ritual\", and \"Universal Negro Catechism\", the latter containing both religious and historical sections, reflecting his interest in religion and race history.<ref name=MARTIN/>\n\nThis was a period of black disillusionment and disenchantment with their status and with the enactment of discriminatory laws. This was not only true in the American South, but also in the Northern cities where the discrimination was also pervasive. In this period, some black leaders promoted separate development of the races.  The mainline churches, such as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] (Anglican), wanted to bring faith to the Blacks, but did not want to advocate \"political and social equality\".<ref>Metropolitan Makarios (Tillyrides) of Nairobi and All Kenya. ''The Origin of Orthodoxy in East Africa.'' Orthodox Research Institute.</ref> <!-- This section needs expansion -->\n\n==African Orthodox Church==\n\nOn 2 September 1921, in the [[Church of the Good Shepherd (New York City)|Church of the Good Shepherd]] in New York City, McGuire founded the African Orthodox Church(AOC). The new denomination was first called the ''Independent Episcopal Church''. A few years later at its first Conclave, or House of Bishops meeting, on 10 September 1924, the denomination was formally organized as the African Orthodox Church (AOC).<ref name=NET-MIN>[http://www.netministries.org/see/churches.exe/ch26904 African Orthodox Church Inc.], Net Ministries Network. Retrieved: 10 February 2017.</ref><ref name=DECOSTER>Right Rev. Philippe L. De Coster (B.Th., D.D. (Belgium), Latin Old Roman Catholic Church of Flanders).

Eucharist and Devotion, 1993-2008. p.3.</ref>\n\nMcGuire believed that blacks who supported the Protestant Episcopal church deserved ecclesiastical independence. Based on traditional Roman Catholic doctrines, was open to all but was under complete black leadership and control. McGuire declared to his followers: \"You must forget the white gods. Erase the white gods from your hearts. We must go back to the native church, to our own true God.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nMcGuire may have been attracted to the Eastern Orthodox Church because it was not associated with racism, colonialism or religious imperialism. It was never involved in widespread missionary activity and had limited contacts with Afro-Americans and Africans. It was not perceived as racist. The adherents of Eastern Orthodoxy were primarily southern and eastern Europeans, people who were recent immigrants to the US and not associated with the establishment. Oriental Orthodoxy was based in what was then known as the Middle East, Egypt, Ethiopia and southern India. The name, ''African Orthodox Church'', \"denoted its aim: to be a universal Black church in affiliation with a branch of Christianity not known for racism or colonialism.\"<ref name=NATS>Theodore Natsoulas. \"Patriarch McGuire and the Spread of the African Orthodox Church to Africa\", ''Journal of Religion in Africa,'' Vol. 12, Fasc. 2 (1981), pp.81-104.</ref>\n\nArticle one of the constitution of the African Orthodox church said: \n<blockquote>The name of this church, which was organized September 2nd, 1921, is and shall be THE AFRICAN ORTHODOX CHURCH. Its faith as declared, is Orthodox, in conformity with the Orthodox Churches of the East from which its Episcopate is derived. While it admits to membership and other privileges persons of all races, IT SEEKS PARTICULARLY TO REACH OUT TO THE MILLIONS OF AFRICAN DESCENT IN BOTH HEMISPHERES, and declares itself to be perpetually autonomous and controlled by Negroes. Hence the name, AFRICAN ORTHODOX.<ref>Warren C. Platt. \"The African Orthodox Church: An Analysis of Its First Decade\", ''Church History'', Vol. 58, No. 4 (Dec., 1989), pp.483-484.</ref></blockquote>\n\nShortly after the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|UNIA]] convention in August 1924, McGuire broke with [[Marcus Garvey]]. He focused on expanding the AOC church, which primarily attracted Anglican immigrants from the West Indies<ref name=NET-MIN/> who were from the [[High Church]] Anglican tradition ([[Anglo-Catholicism]]). McGuire would have liked the AOC to be designated as the official church of UNIA, but Garvey was unwilling to grant such an exclusive privilege to any denomination. McGuire resigned from the UNIA. He ensured official \"orthodox\" status for his new church by arranging apostolic succession for himself.<ref name=MARTIN/>\n\n===Consecration in the American Catholic Church===\n\nMcGuire initiated negotiations with the [[Orthodox Church in America|Russian Orthodox Church in America]] in order to obtain valid [[Apostolic succession|Apostolic Orders]]. The Russians were hesitant to assist the formation of another \"independent\" jurisdiction, however. They were willing to talk, but in the end, they intended to fully control this Black church. This was unacceptable to Fr. McGuire and the other leaders of this new jurisdiction. He met with similar positions from representatives of other Orthodox groups in the U.S.A. Finally the African Orthodox Church entered into negotiations with Archbishop [[Ren\u00e9 Vilatte|Joseph Ren\u00e9 Vilatte]] of the \"[[American Catholic Church (1915)|American Catholic Church]]\" (ACC), an episcopal sect which he had founded.{{#tag:ref|'''Joseph Ren\u00e9 Vilatte''' was ordained to the diaconate on 6 June 1885, and to the priesthood on 7 June 1885, by Bishop [[Eduard Herzog]], the [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland|Old Catholic Bishop of Berne, Switzerland]].<br>\n \t\nVilatte's episcopal consecration took place on 29 May 1892, in the Cathedral of Archbishop Alvares in [[Colombo]] ([[Ceylon]]), when he was consecrated by the Latin Rite [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] Bishop Mar Julious I ([[Antonio Francisco Xavier Alvares]], of the [[Brahmavar (Goan) Orthodox Church]]) and by two other Jacobite bishops, with the permission of the Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch [[Ignatius Peter IV|Ignatius Peter IV (III)]]. Vilatte's longtime goal had been to be recognized as the \"Old Catholic Archbishop of North America.\" The Jacobites consecrated him as: \"Mar Timotheous I, Jacobite Old Catholic Bishop of North America.\"<br>\n\t \nThe Episcopal Church subsequently [[Excommunication#Episcopal Church of the United States of America|excommunicated]] Vilatte. The Roman Catholic Church [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] him both in 1900 and in 1907 (but he was reconciled to Rome from 1925 up to his death in 1929). As bishop, Rene Vilatte consecrated more than 20 new bishops and new churches. Because these consecrations were made outside the authority of the Church, they were called into question. The Syro-Jacobite Church officially withdrew recognition of the secession churches in 1938. Vilatte was accused of not upholding the canons. He was excluded from the jurisdiction of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Church of Antioch]] and was considered an ''[[Episcopi vagantes]]''. <br>\nSome of the Old Catholic sects descended from Vilatte's consecrations claim that, although he had practically abandoned any connection with the Jacobites, some of the Jacobite sects in India consider him a \"Saint\". The validity of Vilatte's Orders in the Roman Catholic Church was never settled, but most non-Roman [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholics]] maintain that his Orders were valid.|group=note}}\n\nFr. McGuire was re-ordained as Bishop in the American Catholic Church, consecrated on 28 September 1921, in Chicago, Illinois, by Archbishop [[Joseph Ren\u00e9 Vilatte]]. He was assisted by bishop Carl A. Nybladh, who had been consecrated by Vilatte.<ref name=DECOSTER/>\n\nThe early issues of ''The Negro Churchman'', the official organ of the AOC, had articles that repeatedly tried to establish the validity of McGuire's consecration. On at least four occasions, a chart was printed on the cover page that traced the apostolic succession from the [[See of Antioch]] to McGuire:<ref name=NATS/>\n:# [[Ignatius Peter IV|Ignatius Peter III (IV)]], [[List of Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch|Syro-Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch]] and successor to S. Peter consecrated:\n:# Paul Athanasius (Paulose Mar Athanasious) in 1877, consecrated:\n:# Archbishop [[Antonio Francisco Xavier Alvares|Alvarez of Ceylon]] in 1889, consecrated:\n:# Archbishop [[Ren\u00e9 Vilatte|Vilatte]] in 1892, consecrated:\n:# Bishop McGuire in 1921.\n\n===Meeting with the Ecumenical Patriarch===\n\nMcGuire tried to gain recognition from the Greek Orthodox [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]. In December 1921, three months after his consecration, McGuire, through the intercession of Eastern Orthodox prelates, was granted an audience with Patriarch [[Meletius IV of Constantinople|Meletios]] while the latter was on a visit to New York City. The Patriarch was interested in the origins and dogma of the AOC. He accepted the Jacobite episcopal source as legitimate but was concerned over its [[Monophysitism|monophysite]] dogma. McGuire apparently had no difficulty in satisfying the Patriarch. Meletios also was concerned with Western Christian influences in dogma that might have permeated the AOC, especially on the question of the nature of the [[Trinity]]. (Both Roman Catholicism and Anglicanism adhere to the belief that the Holy Spirit [[Filioque|proceeds from both the Father and Son]], while Orthodoxy holds procession only from the Father). Here too McGuire appears to have satisfied the Patriarch.\n\nAreas of agreement between Greek Orthodoxy and the AOC included common acceptance of the dogmatic decisions of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|seven Ecumenical Councils]], the seven [[Eastern Orthodox Church#Holy mysteries .28sacraments.29|Sacraments]], the original form of the [[Nicene Creed]], the concept of [[transubstantiation]], the declaration of the Virgin Mary as [[Mother of God]] (God-bearer or ''Theotokos'' in Greek Orthodoxy), justification by both faith and good works, and the rejection of [[predestination]], a Protestant Calvinist belief. McGuire claimed that the Patriarch accepted the AOC as an Orthodox Church but would not afford it [[Full communion|communion]] with Eastern Orthodoxy until it demonstrated stability and growth.<ref name=NATS/>\n\nIn 1924 Meletios and his successor, [[Gregory VII of Constantinople|Gregorios VII]], requested more information and received copies of the AOC's Divine Liturgy, canons, constitution and Declaration of Faith. The AOC never gained the desired recognition from a major Eastern Orthodox Church. Orthodoxy does recognize different rites, but its leaders may have rejected the apparent eclectic nature of the AOC's liturgy and services. At the church's inception, the liturgy was described as a mixture of Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism and Orthodoxy. The chief service was the Mass; minor and major orders were conferred through the [[Roman Pontifical|Catholic Pontifical]]; and the official hymnal was the Anglican ''[[Hymns Ancient and Modern]]''. The AOC was essentially [[Anglo-Catholicism|High Anglican]] and it was Orthodox only to the extent that its leader had the title of Patriarch, that the original form of the [[Nicene Creed]] had been adopted, and that its episcopal source was in an Oriental Orthodox Church.<ref name=NATS/>\n\n===AOC consolidation and growth 1924-1934===\n\nIn 1924, the newly organized conclave of AOC unanimously elected McGuire as archbishop of the church. During the remaining decade of his life, McGuire built the AOC into a thriving international church. Branches were eventually established in Miami, Chicago, Harlem (New York), Boston, and Cambridge, Massachusetts of the US, Canada, Barbados, Cuba, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, and elsewhere. The official organ of AOC, ''The Negro Churchman'', was an effective link for the far-flung organization, with McGuire as its [[Editing|editor]].<ref name=MARTIN/> [[Endich Theological Seminary]] was founded shortly thereafter,<ref>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=fxsmAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false AFRICAN ORTHODOX CHURCH].\" In: Larry G.

It was an effort to promote widespread religious unity under Black leadership. The AOC's inclusion within the [[apostolic succession]] was intended to give it legitimacy both within the Black community and larger Christian world. McGuire did not achieve the growth in his church that he hoped for. While it did increase in size during its first decade, this was primarily through his forceful personality rather than attraction to its principle of apostolic succession. After McGuire's death, the AOC splintered and weakened. In South Africa there was growth, but not at the rate anticipated by [[Daniel William Alexander]]. He did plant new AOC churches in [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Uganda|Uganda]] and Kenya, where they are now under the administrative umbrella of the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria]].<ref name=NATS/>\n\nSecond, in its attempt to bring together Blacks of the [[diaspora]] and Africa into a common movement, the AOC was a manifestation of [[Pan-Africanism]] of the period. Spiritual and emotional needs left unattended in their respective countries, propelled Blacks in the United States and South Africa to affiliate and assert their autonomy in an area where the White establishments saw no threat. Discrimination, racism and second-class citizenship engendered this effort at ecclesiastical independence and racial cooperation on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref name=NATS/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[African Orthodox Church]]\n* [[Harlem Renaissance]]\n* [[Raphael Morgan]]\n* [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Uganda]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Byron Rushing.

Both he and Garvey were immigrants to the United States from Caribbean islands who had a vision of Pan-African goals.\n\nIn addition McGuire was known for his other religious contributions. Already a minister in the [[Moravian Church]] when he immigrated in 1894 to the US, McGuire soon joined the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]]. He was ordained in 1897 as an Episcopal [[priest]]. An early member of the American Negro Historical Society in Philadelphia, McGuire became more concerned about developing institutions that supported persons of African ancestry. In 1921 McGuire founded the [[African Orthodox Church]] (AOC); and he was consecrated that year as its first bishop, serving until his death in 1934. During his tenure, new congregations were started in several cities in the US, Canada, the Caribbean, and in East Africa.\n\nMcGuire envisioned the AOC as a home for Blacks of [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] belief who wanted ecclesiastical independence. It was based on [[Sacred tradition|Christian tradition]] and [[Apostolic succession]].<ref>Mead, Frank S. ''Handbook of Denominations in the United States.'' 10th edition. Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1995. pp.128-129.</ref> Orthodoxy attracted persons of African descent because it had not been implicated in colonialism or slavery.<ref name=MARTIN/>\n\n==Life==\n\nGeorge McGuire was born to an Afro-Caribbean family on 28 March 1866 in [[Swetes]], [[Antigua]]. He studied in local grammar schools, then at the Antigua branch of [[Mico College]] for teachers. He also studies at the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] Miskey Seminary in the [[Danish West Indies]]. From 1888 to 1894 McGuire served as pastor of a [[Moravian Church]] in the Danish West Indies.\n\n==Episcopal Church USA==\nIn 1894, McGuire immigrated to the United States. He initially joined the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], which was the first independent black denomination in the country, founded in the early nineteenth century. On 2 January 1895, McGuire formally joined the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], and two years later he was ordained as a priest.\n\nMcGuire was called to lead small, mostly black Episcopal churches in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; [[Richmond, Virginia]]; and [[Philadelphia]]. St. Philip's Episcopal Church of Richmond, Virginia lists \"Reverend George Alexander McQuire\" as rector from April 1898 to November 1900. After McGuire's tenure, the Rev. [[Raphael Morgan|Robert Josias \"Raphael\" Morgan]] was listed as the rector there from \"1901-April 1901\", likely acting on an interim basis until a full-time rector was called. The two men may have known each other. Morgan was later known as Fr. Raphael when he was ordained in 1907 as an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest.\n\nBy 1901 McGuire was appointed rector of [[African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas|St. Thomas' Episcopal Church in Philadelphia]]; this was the first black congregation in the Episcopal Church. Saint Thomas served the African-American elite of Philadelphia. It had been started in 1794 by [[Absalom Jones]], earlier a founder with [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]] of the [[Free African Society]]. This mutual aid society preceded the African Methodist Episcopal Church founded by Allen.<ref name=MARTIN>Tony Martin.

Cary D. Wintz, Paul Finkelman (Eds.). Taylor & Francis, 2004. p.776.</ref> McGuire was rector of St. Thomas from 1902-05.\n\nHe was succeeded as rector there by A.C.V. Cartier (1906\u201312). Cartier later followed Fr. Raphael Morgan in his interest in the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 1908 Fr Raphael recommended Cartier to the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]] for Orthodox ordination.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1909, McGuire served as Archdeacon for Colored Work in the [[Episcopal Diocese of Arkansas|Diocese of Arkansas]]. He was the church's highest-ranking African American and the first to achieve the rank of [[Archdeacon#Anglican Communion|Archdeacon]]. He worked to increase the number of missions in the state from one to nine. He encountered opposition from the local Episcopal bishop, who believed blacks should be segregated from whites and placed in their own church jurisdiction. Following the Reconstruction era, Arkansas and other southern states had imposed legal racial segregation in most public and private facilities. At the turn of the century, Arkansas and other former Confederate states effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most black citizens]] by raising barriers to voter registration.\n\nEventually McGuire resigned and moved North to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. There he established St. Bartholomew's Church for West Indians who were living in the Boston area. While in Cambridge, McGuire also studied at Boston College of Physicians and Surgeons, receiving his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree in 1910.<ref>''[http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6s235cs College of Physicians and Surgeons (Boston, Mass.)].'' Social Networks and Archival Context (SNAC). Retrieved: 10 February 2017.</ref> When his small church was not recognized by the Episcopal diocese, McGuire resigned in 1911. As he traveled across the U.S., he became more discouraged, believing that blacks did not have opportunities to advance in the Episcopal Church, and decided to leave it.\n\n==Return to Antigua==\n\nIn 1913 McGuire returned to the West Indies, settling in British-controlled [[Antigua and Barbuda|Antigua]] to care for his sick mother. While there he volunteered at a local parish, serving as a minister in the Church of England. He gained acclaim for practicing medicine on the island. When a strike of local [[sugar cane]] workers led to rioting and burning of the sugar cane fields, British colonial officials urged local and religious leaders to oppose the strikes, but McGuire refused and urged official to ensure that workers were paid decent, living wages.\n\n==UNIA==\n\nMcGuire returned to the United States in 1918 and soon afterward joined the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|UNIA]]. [[Marcus Garvey]], a Jamaican immigrant and the president and founder of UNIA, appointed him as first [[Chaplain]]-General of the organization, at its inaugural international convention in New York in August 1920. In this position McGuire wrote two important documents of UNIA, \"Universal Negro Ritual\", and \"Universal Negro Catechism\", the latter containing both religious and historical sections, reflecting his interest in religion and race history.<ref name=MARTIN/>\n\nThis was a period of black disillusionment and disenchantment with their status and with the enactment of discriminatory laws. This was not only true in the American South, but also in the Northern cities where the discrimination was also pervasive. In this period, some black leaders promoted separate development of the races.  The mainline churches, such as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] (Anglican), wanted to bring faith to the Blacks, but did not want to advocate \"political and social equality\".<ref>Metropolitan Makarios (Tillyrides) of Nairobi and All Kenya.

The new denomination was first called the ''Independent Episcopal Church''. A few years later at its first Conclave, or House of Bishops meeting, on 10 September 1924, the denomination was formally organized as the African Orthodox Church (AOC).<ref name=NET-MIN>[http://www.netministries.org/see/churches.exe/ch26904 African Orthodox Church Inc.], Net Ministries Network.

Eucharist and Devotion, 1993-2008. p.3.</ref>\n\nMcGuire believed that blacks who supported the Protestant Episcopal church deserved ecclesiastical independence. Based on traditional Roman Catholic doctrines, was open to all but was under complete black leadership and control. McGuire declared to his followers: \"You must forget the white gods. Erase the white gods from your hearts. We must go back to the native church, to our own true God.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nMcGuire may have been attracted to the Eastern Orthodox Church because it was not associated with racism, colonialism or religious imperialism. It was never involved in widespread missionary activity and had limited contacts with Afro-Americans and Africans. It was not perceived as racist. The adherents of Eastern Orthodoxy were primarily southern and eastern Europeans, people who were recent immigrants to the US and not associated with the establishment. Oriental Orthodoxy was based in what was then known as the Middle East, Egypt, Ethiopia and southern India. The name, ''African Orthodox Church'', \"denoted its aim: to be a universal Black church in affiliation with a branch of Christianity not known for racism or colonialism.\"<ref name=NATS>Theodore Natsoulas. \"Patriarch McGuire and the Spread of the African Orthodox Church to Africa\", ''Journal of Religion in Africa,'' Vol. 12, Fasc. 2 (1981), pp.81-104.</ref>\n\nArticle one of the constitution of the African Orthodox church said: \n<blockquote>The name of this church, which was organized September 2nd, 1921, is and shall be THE AFRICAN ORTHODOX CHURCH. Its faith as declared, is Orthodox, in conformity with the Orthodox Churches of the East from which its Episcopate is derived. While it admits to membership and other privileges persons of all races, IT SEEKS PARTICULARLY TO REACH OUT TO THE MILLIONS OF AFRICAN DESCENT IN BOTH HEMISPHERES, and declares itself to be perpetually autonomous and controlled by Negroes. Hence the name, AFRICAN ORTHODOX.<ref>Warren C. Platt. \"The African Orthodox Church: An Analysis of Its First Decade\", ''Church History'', Vol. 58, No. 4 (Dec., 1989), pp.483-484.</ref></blockquote>\n\nShortly after the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|UNIA]] convention in August 1924, McGuire broke with [[Marcus Garvey]]. He focused on expanding the AOC church, which primarily attracted Anglican immigrants from the West Indies<ref name=NET-MIN/> who were from the [[High Church]] Anglican tradition ([[Anglo-Catholicism]]). McGuire would have liked the AOC to be designated as the official church of UNIA, but Garvey was unwilling to grant such an exclusive privilege to any denomination. McGuire resigned from the UNIA. He ensured official \"orthodox\" status for his new church by arranging apostolic succession for himself.<ref name=MARTIN/>\n\n===Consecration in the American Catholic Church===\n\nMcGuire initiated negotiations with the [[Orthodox Church in America|Russian Orthodox Church in America]] in order to obtain valid [[Apostolic succession|Apostolic Orders]]. The Russians were hesitant to assist the formation of another \"independent\" jurisdiction, however. They were willing to talk, but in the end, they intended to fully control this Black church. This was unacceptable to Fr. McGuire and the other leaders of this new jurisdiction. He met with similar positions from representatives of other Orthodox groups in the U.S.A. Finally the African Orthodox Church entered into negotiations with Archbishop [[Ren\u00e9 Vilatte|Joseph Ren\u00e9 Vilatte]] of the \"[[American Catholic Church (1915)|American Catholic Church]]\" (ACC), an episcopal sect which he had founded.{{#tag:ref|'''Joseph Ren\u00e9 Vilatte''' was ordained to the diaconate on 6 June 1885, and to the priesthood on 7 June 1885, by Bishop [[Eduard Herzog]], the [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland|Old Catholic Bishop of Berne, Switzerland]].<br>\n \t\nVilatte's episcopal consecration took place on 29 May 1892, in the Cathedral of Archbishop Alvares in [[Colombo]] ([[Ceylon]]), when he was consecrated by the Latin Rite [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] Bishop Mar Julious I ([[Antonio Francisco Xavier Alvares]], of the [[Brahmavar (Goan) Orthodox Church]]) and by two other Jacobite bishops, with the permission of the Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch [[Ignatius Peter IV|Ignatius Peter IV (III)]]. Vilatte's longtime goal had been to be recognized as the \"Old Catholic Archbishop of North America.\" The Jacobites consecrated him as: \"Mar Timotheous I, Jacobite Old Catholic Bishop of North America.\"<br>\n\t \nThe Episcopal Church subsequently [[Excommunication#Episcopal Church of the United States of America|excommunicated]] Vilatte. The Roman Catholic Church [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] him both in 1900 and in 1907 (but he was reconciled to Rome from 1925 up to his death in 1929). As bishop, Rene Vilatte consecrated more than 20 new bishops and new churches. Because these consecrations were made outside the authority of the Church, they were called into question. The Syro-Jacobite Church officially withdrew recognition of the secession churches in 1938. Vilatte was accused of not upholding the canons. He was excluded from the jurisdiction of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Church of Antioch]] and was considered an ''[[Episcopi vagantes]]''. <br>\nSome of the Old Catholic sects descended from Vilatte's consecrations claim that, although he had practically abandoned any connection with the Jacobites, some of the Jacobite sects in India consider him a \"Saint\". The validity of Vilatte's Orders in the Roman Catholic Church was never settled, but most non-Roman [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholics]] maintain that his Orders were valid.|group=note}}\n\nFr. McGuire was re-ordained as Bishop in the American Catholic Church, consecrated on 28 September 1921, in Chicago, Illinois, by Archbishop [[Joseph Ren\u00e9 Vilatte]]. He was assisted by bishop Carl A. Nybladh, who had been consecrated by Vilatte.<ref name=DECOSTER/>\n\nThe early issues of ''The Negro Churchman'', the official organ of the AOC, had articles that repeatedly tried to establish the validity of McGuire's consecration. On at least four occasions, a chart was printed on the cover page that traced the apostolic succession from the [[See of Antioch]] to McGuire:<ref name=NATS/>\n:# [[Ignatius Peter IV|Ignatius Peter III (IV)]], [[List of Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch|Syro-Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch]] and successor to S. Peter consecrated:\n:# Paul Athanasius (Paulose Mar Athanasious) in 1877, consecrated:\n:# Archbishop [[Antonio Francisco Xavier Alvares|Alvarez of Ceylon]] in 1889, consecrated:\n:# Archbishop [[Ren\u00e9 Vilatte|Vilatte]] in 1892, consecrated:\n:# Bishop McGuire in 1921.\n\n===Meeting with the Ecumenical Patriarch===\n\nMcGuire tried to gain recognition from the Greek Orthodox [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]. In December 1921, three months after his consecration, McGuire, through the intercession of Eastern Orthodox prelates, was granted an audience with Patriarch [[Meletius IV of Constantinople|Meletios]] while the latter was on a visit to New York City. The Patriarch was interested in the origins and dogma of the AOC. He accepted the Jacobite episcopal source as legitimate but was concerned over its [[Monophysitism|monophysite]] dogma. McGuire apparently had no difficulty in satisfying the Patriarch. Meletios also was concerned with Western Christian influences in dogma that might have permeated the AOC, especially on the question of the nature of the [[Trinity]]. (Both Roman Catholicism and Anglicanism adhere to the belief that the Holy Spirit [[Filioque|proceeds from both the Father and Son]], while Orthodoxy holds procession only from the Father). Here too McGuire appears to have satisfied the Patriarch.\n\nAreas of agreement between Greek Orthodoxy and the AOC included common acceptance of the dogmatic decisions of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|seven Ecumenical Councils]], the seven [[Eastern Orthodox Church#Holy mysteries .28sacraments.29|Sacraments]], the original form of the [[Nicene Creed]], the concept of [[transubstantiation]], the declaration of the Virgin Mary as [[Mother of God]] (God-bearer or ''Theotokos'' in Greek Orthodoxy), justification by both faith and good works, and the rejection of [[predestination]], a Protestant Calvinist belief. McGuire claimed that the Patriarch accepted the AOC as an Orthodox Church but would not afford it [[Full communion|communion]] with Eastern Orthodoxy until it demonstrated stability and growth.<ref name=NATS/>\n\nIn 1924 Meletios and his successor, [[Gregory VII of Constantinople|Gregorios VII]], requested more information and received copies of the AOC's Divine Liturgy, canons, constitution and Declaration of Faith. The AOC never gained the desired recognition from a major Eastern Orthodox Church. Orthodoxy does recognize different rites, but its leaders may have rejected the apparent eclectic nature of the AOC's liturgy and services. At the church's inception, the liturgy was described as a mixture of Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism and Orthodoxy. The chief service was the Mass; minor and major orders were conferred through the [[Roman Pontifical|Catholic Pontifical]]; and the official hymnal was the Anglican ''[[Hymns Ancient and Modern]]''. The AOC was essentially [[Anglo-Catholicism|High Anglican]] and it was Orthodox only to the extent that its leader had the title of Patriarch, that the original form of the [[Nicene Creed]] had been adopted, and that its episcopal source was in an Oriental Orthodox Church.<ref name=NATS/>\n\n===AOC consolidation and growth 1924-1934===\n\nIn 1924, the newly organized conclave of AOC unanimously elected McGuire as archbishop of the church. During the remaining decade of his life, McGuire built the AOC into a thriving international church. Branches were eventually established in Miami, Chicago, Harlem (New York), Boston, and Cambridge, Massachusetts of the US, Canada, Barbados, Cuba, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, and elsewhere. The official organ of AOC, ''The Negro Churchman'', was an effective link for the far-flung organization, with McGuire as its [[Editing|editor]].<ref name=MARTIN/> [[Endich Theological Seminary]] was founded shortly thereafter,<ref>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=fxsmAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false AFRICAN ORTHODOX CHURCH].\" In: Larry G.

It was an effort to promote widespread religious unity under Black leadership. The AOC's inclusion within the [[apostolic succession]] was intended to give it legitimacy both within the Black community and larger Christian world. McGuire did not achieve the growth in his church that he hoped for. While it did increase in size during its first decade, this was primarily through his forceful personality rather than attraction to its principle of apostolic succession. After McGuire's death, the AOC splintered and weakened. In South Africa there was growth, but not at the rate anticipated by [[Daniel William Alexander]].

Spiritual and emotional needs left unattended in their respective countries, propelled Blacks in the United States and South Africa to affiliate and assert their autonomy in an area where the White establishments saw no threat. Discrimination, racism and second-class citizenship engendered this effort at ecclesiastical independence and racial cooperation on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref name=NATS/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[African Orthodox Church]]\n* [[Harlem Renaissance]]\n* [[Raphael Morgan]]\n* [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Uganda]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Byron Rushing.

The tail is half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body and laterally compressed. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low, smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\nAlpine newts are blackish\u2013grey to bluish on the sides and the back, while their belly is an unspotted orange. Males also have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Females are of a more drab, mottled colour than males. Body shape and colour differ slightly among the subspecies.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u20138 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|4-5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. They are usually light brown-yellow and darker towards the tail, which ends in a small, pointed filament.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n==Taxonomy and Systematics==\n\n===Nomenclature===\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768, as ''Triton alpestris'' from mount [[\u00d6tscher]] in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin), by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]].{{r|Laurenti1768}} Laurenti thought that males, females and larvae were different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. As this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages, the alpine newt was split off as [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, it was argued that a larva Laurenti had described as ''Proteus tritonius'' in fact represented the alpine newt. The name ''Ichthyosaura'' introduced by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] in 1801 for that larva{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}}\n\n===Subspecies===\n\nThe subdivision of the alpine newt is controversial. A number of subspecies have been described, but many were not recognised by later authors. Differences in shape and colour are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} However, there are clearly distinct ancient [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]] within the species (see section ''Evolution'' below). Several authors therefore argued that the alpine newt might even represent several [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} An article from 2018 accepted four species,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this has been considered premature in ''Amphibian Species of the World''.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\nFour subspecies were recognised in the ''Handbook of the Amphibians and Reptiles of Europe'' (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} and this has been followed by a 2010 monograph{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=16-36}} and ''Salamanders of the Old World'' (2014):{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=214}}\n\n*Alpine newt \u2013 ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|(Laurenti, 1768)}}: The [[nominate subspecies|nominate]], northernmost and most widespread subspecies. It is not a [[natural group]]: Populations from western and central Europe form a lineage with ''I. a. cyreni'', while eastern populations are closer to the Greek alpine newt.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} These eastern populations have also been separated as species ''I. reiseri'' with three subspecies.{{r|Raffaelli2018}}\n\n*Apennine alpine newt \u2013 ''I. a. apuana'' {{small|(Gray, 1850)}}: Has also been recognised as species ''I. apuana'' and isolated populations from southern Italy as subspecies ''I. a. inexpectata''.{{r|Raffaelli2018}}\n\n*Cantabrian alpine newt \u2013 ''I. a. cyreni'' {{small|(Mertens & Muller, 1940)}}: Close to the western populations of ''I. a. alpestris''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\n*Greek alpine newt \u2013 ''I. a. veluchiensis'' {{small|(Wolterstorff, 1935)}}: Close to the eastern populations of ''I. a. alpestris''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\n==Distribution==\n\nThe alpine newt is native to continental Europe, with its subspecies occuring in different areas:{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214\u2013215|2=iucn|3=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=39-46|4=RecueroBuckley2014|5=Raffaelli2018}}\n\n* The ''western group'' of the nominate subspecies ''I. a. alpestris'' occurs almost continuously from northwestern France over most of Germany and southern Poland to the northern [[Carpathians]] in Romania. It reaches southern Denmark in the north. In the south, it occurs until just north of mediterranean France and in the Alps.\n\n* The ''eastern group'' of the nominate subspecies is found in the [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece, and until Bulgaria in the east as well as in the southern Carpathians in Romania.\n\n* The Appenine alpine newt (''I. a. apuana'') is separated from the northern subspecies by the [[Po valley]]. It occurs form the extrem southeastern France over the [[Appenines]] until [[Latium]] in central Italy. Isolated populations from three mountain lakes in [[Cantabria]] have also been considered as different subspecies, ''I. a. inexpectata''.\n\n* The Cantabrian alpine newt (''I. a. cyreni'') is found in the [[Cantabrian mountains]] of northern Spain, isolated from the rest of the species' range. An isolated population in the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] of central Spain is probably the result of an introduction.\n\n* The Greek Alpine newt (''I. a. veluchiensis'') is found from the Greek mainland to the northern [[Peloponnese]], where the southernmost populations of the alpine newt occur.\n\nAlpine newts have been [[introduced species|introduced]] to Great Britain and the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] in central Spain{{r|iucn}} as well as New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==Habitat==\n\nLike other newts, the alpine newt depends on both humid, cover-rich land habitats as well as aquatic breeding sites. It tolerates a wide range of conditions. In its terrrestrial phase, it is mainly found in forested and recently cleared areas, where it hides under logs, stones or in small [[burrow]]s. Breeding sites can vary from temporary puddles to ponds, large reservoirs and quiet parts of streams, and the species is relatively tolerant regarding temperature and [[eutrophication]].{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\n==Life and behaviour==\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv | thumb | right | Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n[[File:Mesotriton alpestris apuanus04.jpg | thumb | right | Paedomorphic adult (above) and larva (below) of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nThe aquatic phase starts as soon as ice starts to disappear, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August. Alpine newts tend to visit the same breeding sites again each year.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Like in other newts, males perform a [[courtship display]], which differs somewhat from other species. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while and, fans its tail to stimulate the female and waves [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with rivals' display.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}  Experiments suggested that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}\n\nFemales attach their eggs individually to water plants or other objects. They lay clutches of 70\u2013390 eggs, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (with a 2.5\u20133 mm capsule). Incubation time depends on temperature, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks. They [[metamorphose]] into terrestrial [[eft]]s after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year. [[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults retain a larva-like appearance with [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is common. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts can co-occur and interbreed, but appear to prefer different prey.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\nThe alpine newt reaches [[sexual maturity]] at around three years in males, and four to five years in females, and can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\nFeeding takes place mainly during the night. Alpine newts take various [[invertebrates]] such as [[earthworms]], [[isopod]]s, small insects and [[crane fly]] and [[mayfly]] larvae, but also eggs and larvae of other amphibians. Their predators include snakes, birds and fish.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt [[population]]s have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular phylogenetic]] estimate.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Fossil remains of the alpine newt were found in the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be its [[sister species]].{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nAnalyses showed that populations fall into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which only in part correspond to described [[subspecies]] (see below).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the [[Miocene]] or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] and [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial DNA]] show different population structures, which may results from [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages. The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of population retreat, expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt is classified as [[Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]]; the population trend however is \"Decreasing\".{{r|iucn}} Threats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats, as well as the introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]], to breeding sites.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}} In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease. At least one introduced population in the United Kingdom was affected by [[chytridiomycosis]],{{r|iucn}} and for the exotic subspecies ''I. a. apuana'' in New Zealand, [[eradication]] was recommended.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | 30em | refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bell2016\">{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=B.D. | title = A review of potential alpine newt (''Ichthyosaura alpestris'') impacts on native frogs in New Zealand | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand | volume = 46 | issue=3\u20134 | year = 2016 | pages = 214\u2013231 | issn=0303-6758 | doi = 10.1080/03036758.2016.1216455}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolkay1928\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bolkay | first1 = J. | title = Die Sch\u00e4del der Salamandrinen, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf ihre systematische Bedeutung | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte | volume = 86 | issue = 3-4 | year = 1928 | pages = 259\u2013319 | issn = 0340-2061 |doi = 10.1007/BF02117989 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Frost2020\">{{ cite web |last=Frost |first=D.R. | year = 2020 | title = ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' (Laurenti, 1768).

The tail is half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body and laterally compressed. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low, smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\nAlpine newts are blackish\u2013grey to bluish on the sides and the back, while their belly is an unspotted orange. Males also have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Females are of a more drab, mottled colour than males. Body shape and colour differ slightly among the subspecies.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u20138 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|4-5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. They are usually light brown-yellow and darker towards the tail, which ends in a small, pointed filament.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n==Taxonomy and Systematics==\n\n===Nomenclature===\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768,{{r|Laurenti1768}} as ''Triton alpestris'' from mount [[\u00d6tscher]] in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin), by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]]. Laurenti thought that males, females and larvae were different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. As this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages, the alpine newt was split off as [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, it was argued that a larva Laurenti had described as ''Proteus tritonius'' in fact represented the alpine newt. The name ''Ichthyosaura'' introduced by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] in 1801 for that larva{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}}\n\n===Subspecies===\n\nThe subdivision of the alpine newt is controversial. A number of subspecies have been described, but many were not recognised by later authors. Differences in shape and colour are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} However, there are clearly distinct ancient [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]] within the species (see section ''Evolution'' below). Several authors therefore argued that the alpine newt might even represent several [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} An article from 2018 accepted four species,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this has been considered premature in ''Amphibian Species of the World''.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\nFour subspecies were recognised in the ''Handbook of the Amphibians and Reptiles of Europe'' (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} and this has been followed by a 2010 monograph{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=16-36}} and ''Salamanders of the Old World'' (2014):{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=214}}\n\n*Alpine newt \u2013 ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|(Laurenti, 1768)}}: The [[nominate subspecies|nominate]], northernmost and most widespread subspecies. It is not a [[natural group]]: Populations from western and central Europe form a lineage with ''I. a. cyreni'', while eastern populations are closer to the Greek alpine newt.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} These eastern populations have also been separated as species ''I. reiseri'' with three subspecies.{{r|Raffaelli2018}}\n\n*Apennine alpine newt \u2013 ''I. a. apuana'' {{small|(Gray, 1850)}}: Has also been recognised as species ''I. apuana'' and isolated populations from southern Italy as subspecies ''I. a. inexpectata''.{{r|Raffaelli2018}}\n\n*Cantabrian alpine newt \u2013 ''I. a. cyreni'' {{small|(Mertens & Muller, 1940)}}: Close to the western populations of ''I. a. alpestris''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\n*Greek alpine newt \u2013 ''I. a. veluchiensis'' {{small|(Wolterstorff, 1935)}}: Close to the eastern populations of ''I. a. alpestris''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\n==Distribution==\n\nThe alpine newt is native to continental Europe, with its subspecies occuring in different areas:{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214\u2013215|2=iucn|3=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=39-46|4=RecueroBuckley2014|5=Raffaelli2018}}\n\n* The ''western group'' of the nominate subspecies ''I. a. alpestris'' occurs almost continuously from northwestern France over most of Germany and southern Poland to the northern [[Carpathians]] in Romania. It reaches southern Denmark in the north. In the south, it occurs until just north of mediterranean France and in the Alps.\n\n* The ''eastern group'' of the nominate subspecies is found in the [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece, and until Bulgaria in the east as well as in the southern Carpathians in Romania.\n\n* The Appenine alpine newt (''I. a. apuana'') is separated from the northern subspecies by the [[Po valley]]. It occurs form the extrem southeastern France over the [[Appenines]] until [[Latium]] in central Italy. Isolated populations from three mountain lakes in [[Cantabria]] have also been considered as different subspecies, ''I. a. inexpectata''.\n\n* The Cantabrian alpine newt (''I. a. cyreni'') is found in the [[Cantabrian mountains]] of northern Spain, isolated from the rest of the species' range. An isolated population in the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] of central Spain is probably the result of an introduction.\n\n* The Greek Alpine newt (''I. a. veluchiensis'') is found from the Greek mainland to the northern [[Peloponnese]], where the southernmost populations of the alpine newt occur.\n\nAlpine newts have been [[introduced species|introduced]] to Great Britain and the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] in central Spain{{r|iucn}} as well as New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==Habitat==\n\nLike other newts, the alpine newt depends on both humid, cover-rich land habitats as well as aquatic breeding sites. It tolerates a wide range of conditions. In its terrrestrial phase, it is mainly found in forested and recently cleared areas, where it hides under logs, stones or in small [[burrow]]s. Breeding sites can vary from temporary puddles to ponds, large reservoirs and quiet parts of streams, and the species is relatively tolerant regarding temperature and [[eutrophication]].{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\n==Life and behaviour==\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv | thumb | right | Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n[[File:Mesotriton alpestris apuanus04.jpg | thumb | right | Paedomorphic adult (above) and larva (below) of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nThe aquatic phase starts as soon as ice starts to disappear, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August. Alpine newts tend to visit the same breeding sites again each year.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Like in other newts, males perform a [[courtship display]], which differs somewhat from other species. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while and, fans its tail to stimulate the female and waves [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with rivals' display.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}  Experiments suggested that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}\n\nFemales attach their eggs individually to water plants or other objects. They lay clutches of 70\u2013390 eggs, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (with a 2.5\u20133 mm capsule). Incubation time depends on temperature, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks. They [[metamorphose]] into terrestrial [[eft]]s after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year. [[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults retain a larva-like appearance with [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is common. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts can co-occur and interbreed, but appear to prefer different prey.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\nThe alpine newt reaches [[sexual maturity]] at around three years in males, and four to five years in females, and can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\nFeeding takes place mainly during the night. Alpine newts take various [[invertebrates]] such as [[earthworms]], [[isopod]]s, small insects and [[crane fly]] and [[mayfly]] larvae, but also eggs and larvae of other amphibians. Their predators include snakes, birds and fish.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt [[population]]s have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular phylogenetic]] estimate.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Fossil remains of the alpine newt were found in the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be its [[sister species]].{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nAnalyses showed that populations fall into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which only in part correspond to described [[subspecies]] (see below).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the [[Miocene]] or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] and [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial DNA]] show different population structures, which may results from [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages. The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of population retreat, expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt is classified as [[Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]]; the population trend however is \"Decreasing\".{{r|iucn}} Threats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats, as well as the introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]], to breeding sites.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}} In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease. At least one introduced population in the United Kingdom was affected by [[chytridiomycosis]],{{r|iucn}} and for the exotic subspecies ''I. a. apuana'' in New Zealand, [[eradication]] was recommended.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | 30em | refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bell2016\">{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=B.D. | title = A review of potential alpine newt (''Ichthyosaura alpestris'') impacts on native frogs in New Zealand | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand | volume = 46 | issue=3\u20134 | year = 2016 | pages = 214\u2013231 | issn=0303-6758 | doi = 10.1080/03036758.2016.1216455}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolkay1928\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bolkay | first1 = J. | title = Die Sch\u00e4del der Salamandrinen, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf ihre systematische Bedeutung | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte | volume = 86 | issue = 3-4 | year = 1928 | pages = 259\u2013319 | issn = 0340-2061 |doi = 10.1007/BF02117989 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Frost2020\">{{ cite web |last=Frost |first=D.R. | year = 2020 | title = ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' (Laurenti, 1768).

It runs from junction 8 of the [[M6 motorway|M6]] at [[West Bromwich]] near [[Birmingham]] to [[Exeter]] in [[Devon]]. Heading southwest, the M5 runs east of [[West Bromwich]] and west of Birmingham through [[Sandwell Valley]]. It continues past [[Bromsgrove]] (and from [[Birmingham]] and [[Bromsgrove]] is part of the Birmingham Motorway Box), [[Droitwich Spa]], [[Worcester, England|Worcester]], [[Tewkesbury]], [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucester]], [[Bristol]], [[Weston-super-Mare]], [[Bridgwater]], [[Taunton]], terminating at junction 31 for [[Exeter]]. Congestion on the section south of the [[M4 motorway|M4]] is common during the summer holidays, on Friday afternoons and bank holidays.\n==Route==\n[[File:M5 motorway, Cullompton.jpg|thumb|M5 near junction 28, [[Devon]]]]\nThe M5 follows the route of the [[A38 road]] quite closely. The two deviate slightly around [[Bristol]] and the area south of Bristol from junctions 16 to the [[Sedgemoor services]] north of junction 22. The A38 goes straight through the centre of Bristol and passes by [[Bristol Airport]], while the M5 skirts both, with access to the airport from junctions 18, 19 or 22. The A38 continues south into Devon from junction 31, near [[Exminster]]. Between junction 21, [[Weston-super-Mare]] and junction 22, [[Burnham-on-Sea]], the M5 passes by an isolated landmark hill called [[Brent Knoll Camp|Brent Knoll]]. The [[Willow Man]] sculpture is visible from both carriageways, and acts as a landmark just to the south of junction 23.\n\nJunction 15 of the M5 is a large four-level [[stack interchange]], named the [[Almondsbury Interchange]], where the M5 meets the busy [[M4 motorway|M4]]. The [[Avonmouth Bridge]], between junctions 18 and 19, is often a bottleneck during heavy traffic periods, due mainly to lane drops at either ends of the bridge for the respective junctions, and the sharp angle in the centre of the bridge, which causes larger vehicles to slow considerably.<ref>{{cite web|title=Out and About In Bristol|url=http://www.touruk.co.uk/bristol/Bristol-Attractions.htm?attraction=Out%20and%20About&attractiontype=O|publisher=Tour UK|accessdate=15 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402212509/http://www.touruk.co.uk/bristol/Bristol-Attractions.htm?attraction=Out%20and%20About&attractiontype=O|archivedate=2 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  There are split-level carriageways where the M5 ascends the hillsides above the [[Gordano Valley]], between [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], junction 19 and [[Clevedon]], junction 20.\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\nThe first {{convert|26|mi}} of the M5 motorway was constructed as a dual two-lane motorway with [[Worcestershire County Council]] acting as engineer.<ref name=charlesworth135-140>Charlesworth, George (1984), pp.135\u2013140.</ref>  This section{{spaced ndash}}from junction 4 ([[Lydiate Ash]]) in the north to a [[trumpet interchange|trumpet junction]] with the [[M50 motorway (Great Britain)|M50]] in the south{{spaced ndash}}opened in July 1962.<ref name=charlesworth135-140/><ref name=charlesworth100-123>Charlesworth, George (1984), Table 7.3 \u2013 pp.100\u2013123.</ref> This original section of the M5, from junctions 4 to 8, was widened to provide six lanes in the early 1990s.

The Ministry of Transport insisted that a dual 2-lane motorway would be built at a cost of around \u00a38 million. The Motorways archive also records that the carriageways were also built to a lower overall width of 88 feet rather than 100 to reduce the loss of agricultural land. When the decision became necessary to widen the Worcestershire section of M5, it cost \u00a3123 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://motorwayarchive.ihtservices.co.uk/en/motorways/motorway-listing/m5/m5-widening-between-junctions-3--8/index.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103192435/http://motorwayarchive.ihtservices.co.uk/en/motorways/motorway-listing/m5/m5-widening-between-junctions-3--8/index.cfm |archivedate=3 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|2|mi|km}} dual two-lane section between Junctions 16 and 17 built at [[Filton]], near [[Bristol]], was also opened in 1962, and was intended to replace the pre-war Filton bypass.<ref name=charlesworth135-140/><ref name=charlesworth100-123/><ref name=OS156>Ordnance Survey One Inch Map of Great Britain, Series 7 Sheet 156, major roads revised 1963.</ref> [[Gloucestershire County Council]] acted as engineer for this section, which was widened to a dual three-lane motorway in 1969.<ref name=charlesworth100-123/>\n\nNorth of Junction 4 the M5 was constructed in sections, from 1967 to 1970, together with the [[Frankley services]].

At the same time there were plans for large scale business & housing developments at Brockworth, near Gloucester. To relieve Junction 11 of some of the new traffic generated, & avoid more congestion around both Cheltenham & Gloucester, a new junction, Junction 11A, some 3.5 miles south of Junction 11, was constructed & opened in the mid-1990s.\n\n[[File:040424 026 avonmouth.jpg|thumb|The Avonmouth Bridge, Bristol]]\nThe [[Avonmouth Bridge]] was converted to eight lanes (four lanes in each direction) in the early 2000s. Later, in 2005\u20132006, parts of the M5 between Junctions 17 and 20 were widened to 7 lanes (four lanes climbing the hills and three lanes descending the hills); [[variable message sign]]s were added and parts of the central reservation was converted to a [[concrete step barrier]].

The distance from Junctions 12 and 13 is similar and traffic congestion is heavy on the A419 towards Junction 13 whereas it is usually lighter on the B4008 towards Junction 12. As traffic leaving the M5 northbound towards [[Gloucester]] needs to give way to this traffic coming from the B4008, the queue on the motorway can extend beyond the first sign for the junction.\n\nThe [[Cullompton services]] are signed on the motorway in the northbound direction only. This was implemented to reduce congestion at the low capacity junction, although there is still access available to the services southbound through the junction. Also, the northbound exit slip to the junction was reduced to one lane instead of two to reduce traffic on the small roundabout at the west side of the junction.\n[[File:M5 Motorway Entrance Sign.jpeg|thumb|M5 entrance sign at [[Exeter]]]]\nIn 2009, it was announced that the lighting between junctions 30 and 31 would be turned off between midnight and 5.00am to save energy.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/7940865.stm\n|title=Night switch-off for M5 lighting\n|work=BBC News\n|date = 12 March 2009\n|accessdate =10 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nProposals were announced in September 2009 for a new [[Gloucester services|Gloucester Services]] between junctions 11a and 12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/gloucestershireheadlines/Eco-services-plan-M5/article-1343458-detail/article.html|title=Eco-services plan for M5|work=This is Gloucestershire|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=15 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911234911/http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/gloucestershireheadlines/Eco-services-plan-M5/article-1343458-detail/article.html|archivedate=11 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A planning application was submitted in December 2009.

It runs from junction 8 of the [[M6 motorway|M6]] at [[West Bromwich]] near [[Birmingham]] to [[Exeter]] in [[Devon]]. Heading southwest, the M5 runs east of [[West Bromwich]] and west of Birmingham through [[Sandwell Valley]]. It continues past [[Bromsgrove]] (and from [[Birmingham]] and [[Bromsgrove]] is part of the Birmingham Motorway Box), [[Droitwich Spa]], [[Worcester, England|Worcester]], [[Tewkesbury]], [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucester]], [[Bristol]], [[Weston-super-Mare]], [[Bridgwater]], [[Taunton]], terminating at junction 31 for [[Exeter]]. Congestion on the section south of the [[M4 motorway|M4]] is common during the summer holidays, on Friday afternoons and bank holidays.\n==Route==\n[[File:M5 motorway, Cullompton.jpg|thumb|M5 near junction 28, [[Devon]]]]\nThe M5 follows the route of the [[A38 road]] quite closely. The two deviate slightly around [[Bristol]] and the area south of Bristol from junctions 16 to the [[Sedgemoor services]] north of junction 22. The A38 goes straight through the centre of Bristol and passes by [[Bristol Airport]], while the M5 skirts both, with access to the airport from junctions 18, 19 or 22. The A38 continues south into Devon from junction 31, near [[Exminster]]. Between junction 21, [[Weston-super-Mare]] and junction 22, [[Burnham-on-Sea]], the M5 passes by an isolated landmark hill called [[Brent Knoll Camp|Brent Knoll]]. The [[Willow Man]] sculpture is visible from both carriageways, and acts as a landmark just to the south of junction 23.\n\nJunction 15 of the M5 is a large four-level [[stack interchange]], named the [[Almondsbury Interchange]], where the M5 meets the busy [[M4 motorway|M4]]. The [[Avonmouth Bridge]], between junctions 18 and 19, is often a bottleneck during heavy traffic periods, due mainly to lane drops at either ends of the bridge for the respective junctions, and the sharp angle in the centre of the bridge, which causes larger vehicles to slow considerably.<ref>{{cite web|title=Out and About In Bristol|url=http://www.touruk.co.uk/bristol/Bristol-Attractions.htm?attraction=Out%20and%20About&attractiontype=O|publisher=Tour UK|accessdate=15 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402212509/http://www.touruk.co.uk/bristol/Bristol-Attractions.htm?attraction=Out%20and%20About&attractiontype=O|archivedate=2 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  There are split-level carriageways where the M5 ascends the hillsides above the [[Gordano Valley]], between [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], junction 19 and [[Clevedon]], junction 20.\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\nThe first {{convert|26|mi}} of the M5 motorway was constructed as a dual two-lane motorway with [[Worcestershire County Council]] acting as engineer.<ref name=charlesworth135-140>Charlesworth, George (1984), pp.135\u2013140.</ref>  This section{{spaced ndash}}from junction 4 ([[Lydiate Ash]]) in the north to a [[trumpet interchange|trumpet junction]] with the [[M50 motorway (Great Britain)|M50]] in the south{{spaced ndash}}opened in July 1962.<ref name=charlesworth135-140/><ref name=charlesworth100-123>Charlesworth, George (1984), Table 7.3 \u2013 pp.100\u2013123.</ref> This original section of the M5, from junctions 4 to 8, was widened to provide six lanes in the early 1990s.

The Ministry of Transport insisted that a dual 2-lane motorway would be built at a cost of around \u00a38 million. The Motorways archive also records that the carriageways were also built to a lower overall width of 88 feet rather than 100 to reduce the loss of agricultural land.

At the same time there were plans for large scale business & housing developments at Brockworth, near Gloucester. To relieve Junction 11 of some of the new traffic generated, & avoid more congestion around both Cheltenham & Gloucester, a new junction, Junction 11A, some 3.5 miles south of Junction 11, was constructed & opened in the mid-1990s.\n\n[[File:040424 026 avonmouth.jpg|thumb|The Avonmouth Bridge, Bristol]]\nThe [[Avonmouth Bridge]] was converted to eight lanes (four lanes in each direction) in the early 2000s. Later, in 2005\u20132006, parts of the M5 between Junctions 17 and 20 were widened to 7 lanes (four lanes climbing the hills and three lanes descending the hills); [[variable message sign]]s were added and parts of the central reservation was converted to a [[concrete step barrier]].

The distance from Junctions 12 and 13 is similar and traffic congestion is heavy on the A419 towards Junction 13 whereas it is usually lighter on the B4008 towards Junction 12.

This was implemented to reduce congestion at the low capacity junction, although there is still access available to the services southbound through the junction. Also, the northbound exit slip to the junction was reduced to one lane instead of two to reduce traffic on the small roundabout at the west side of the junction.\n[[File:M5 Motorway Entrance Sign.jpeg|thumb|M5 entrance sign at [[Exeter]]]]\nIn 2009, it was announced that the lighting between junctions 30 and 31 would be turned off between midnight and 5.00am to save energy.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/7940865.stm\n|title=Night switch-off for M5 lighting\n|work=BBC News\n|date = 12 March 2009\n|accessdate =10 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nProposals were announced in September 2009 for a new [[Gloucester services|Gloucester Services]] between junctions 11a and 12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/gloucestershireheadlines/Eco-services-plan-M5/article-1343458-detail/article.html|title=Eco-services plan for M5|work=This is Gloucestershire|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=15 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911234911/http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/gloucestershireheadlines/Eco-services-plan-M5/article-1343458-detail/article.html|archivedate=11 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A planning application was submitted in December 2009.

{"title_page": "Patrick Hume of Polwarth", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2017}}\n'''Sir Patrick Hume of [[Polwarth, Scottish Borders|Polwarth]] and Redbraes''' (c.1550\u2013 June 1609) was a Scottish courtier and [[makar]] ([[court poet]]), the eldest son of Sir Patrick Hume of Polwarth & Redbrayes and his spouse Agnes, daughter of Alexander Home of Manderston, Berwicksuire, all major [[Scottish Borders]] families with landholdings in [[The Merse]]. As eldest son, Patrick Hume succeeded to the family estates, including [[Redbraes Castle]], on the death of his father on 20th May 1599. His brothers notably included the cleric, poet and courtier [[Alexander Hume]] (c. 1557\u20131609). \n\nPatrick Hume was introduced to the Scottish court, probably by his father as a member of the royal household, sometime before 1580. He rose to prominence as one of the household servants of the king, [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]], and after 1589 to the [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]], becoming Scottish [[warden of the Marches]] in 1591 and keeper of [[Tantallon Castle]] the following year. \n\nHe is probably best known to history through his association with the [[Castalian Band]], the group of court poets writing in [[Scots language|Scots]] headed by the king in the 1580s and 1590s. Only two works by him are known, his first published poem, ''The Promine'' (1580), a hagiographical portrait of the king in [[aureate]] verse, and his contribution to ''The Flyting Betwixt Montgomerie and Polwart'' (c.1583), a poetic contest in which he proved himself a worthy opponent to [[Alexander Montgomerie]]. Both works have survived. \n\nHume was knighted in later life, probably around 1605, though he does not seem to have had quite the same courtly ambition as his younger brothers. He was a rather reluctant [[juror]] in the 1606 treason trial in [[Linlithgow]] brought by [[George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar]] on behalf of the king in London against a number of [[Church of Scotland]] ministers who were defying James' attempts to bring about a union between the Scottish and English Churches.<ref>[http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usebooks/lang-shorthistory/section15.html Undiscovered Scotland] See section ''Union of the Crowns''.</ref>\n\nHe was succeeded by his eldest son, also Sir Patrick Hume, who died in 1648.\n\nPatrick was married to Juliana Ker (sic) daughter of Sir Thomas Ker of Fernihurst by his spouse Jonet, daughter of Sir William Scott of Kirkud. Following Patrick's death she married in September 1613, as his third wife, [[Thomas Hamilton, 1st Earl of Haddington|Sir Thomas Hamilton of Priestfield]], (later Earl of Melrose and subsequently 1st Earl of Haddington.)

The [[Vanderbilt Cup]] soon became an institution on New York's [[Long Island]], attracting American and European competitors alike. However, the race was plagued by crowd control problems, which led to spectator deaths and injuries, and the cancellation of the 1907 event. Upon its return for 1908, the [[American Automobile Association]] did not adopt the new Grand Prix regulations agreed upon by the ''[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|Association Internationale des Automobiles Clubs Reconnus]]'' (AIACR).<ref name=\"Etzrodt\">{{cite web |last=Etzrodt |first=Hans |title=Grand Prix Winners 1895\u20131949.

Wagner won the race by the close margin of 56 seconds.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|pp=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nDespite the success of the Savannah event, it was decided that the 1909 race would be held on Long Island, in conjunction with the Vanderbilt Cup. However, only the Vanderbilt race was held and the Grand Prize pushed back to the next year. After the 1910 Vanderbilt Cup saw more issues, including the deaths of two riding mechanics and several serious spectator injuries, the Grand Prize was cancelled once again. A last-minute request by the Savannah club saved the race for the year, but only gave one month to prepare the course. A shorter {{convert|17|mi|km|adj=on}} course was laid out, but due to the short notice, most European teams were not able to make the trip. The leading trio from 1908 did make it and American [[David Bruce-Brown]] joined the Benz squad. Bruce-Brown won another incredibly tight race over teammate H\u00e9mery, this time by only 1.42 seconds.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|pp=16\u201318}}</ref> The 1911 event returned to Savannah, and this time the Vanderbilt Cup came with it; the Cup and Grand Prize were to be held together until 1916. Despite the success of the events, public pressure started to mount on the organizers. The use of convict labor and the militia drew criticism, as did the nuisance of closing roads for the event.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|p=26}}</ref> Two accidents on the open roads in practice, one resulting in the death of Jay McNay, cast a shadow over the event. The American entries dominated the support events and ran well throughout the Grand Prize, after poor showings in past years and once again Bruce-Brown triumphed, this time driving a Fiat.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|p=25}}</ref>\n\nFor 1912, Savannah succumbed to public pressure, and [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], won the bid for the race. A narrow, {{convert|7.88|mi|km|adj=on}} trapezoidal course was set up on the outskirts of the city, in [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]]. As in 1911, tragedy struck in practice when David Bruce-Brown was killed after a puncture sent him off the road. On the final lap of the race, [[Ralph DePalma]] collided with eventual winner [[Caleb Bragg]], seriously injuring DePalma and his mechanic and ending any chance of a second race at Milwaukee.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|pp=26\u201328}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1915 American Grand Prize grid 1.jpg|thumb|The grid for the 1915 Grand Prize in San Francisco]]\n\nThe Grand Prize was not held in 1913, after Long Island's bid was rejected and Savannah refused to provide sufficient prize money. [[Board track racing|Oval racing on board tracks]] had taken off in the United States, to the detriment of road racing. For 1914, the Grand Prize and Vanderbilt Cup were staged in [[Santa Monica, California]] near [[Los Angeles]], on an {{convert|8.4|mi|km|adj=on}} course, with the start/finish straight along the Pacific Ocean. The field was primarily American entries (twelve, against five European entries), and the Americans dominated, with [[Eddie Pullen]]'s [[Mercer (car)|Mercer]] winning by over 40 seconds.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|pp=29\u201331}}</ref> In 1915, the race shifted to San Francisco, in conjunction with the [[Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition]]. With the outbreak of World War I in Europe, almost all of the drivers and cars were American, except for a few cars imported earlier. The {{convert|3.84|mi|km|adj=on}} course was set up around the Exposition grounds and nearby oval track with a boarded main straightaway. Heavy rain began two hours into the race, covering the circuit in mud from the extensive flower arrangements, and warping the main straight's boards. [[Dario Resta]] in a [[Peugeot]] cruised to a seven-minute victory, and followed up a week later by winning the Vanderbilt Cup.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|pp=32\u201333}}</ref> For 1916, the Grand Prize returned to Santa Monica. The race would be a part of the [[1916 AAA Championship Car season|AAA National Championship]], which carried a 4.91-liter displacement limit. Although the limit for the Grand Prize was 7.37 liters, no large-displacement cars would enter. The race was the penultimate round of the championship, with Dario Resta leading [[Johnny Aitken]] after his Vanderbilt Cup win. However, both cars would be out before halfway. Although Aitken took over teammate [[Howdy Wilcox]]'s car for the win, the AAA awarded points only to Wilcox, and Resta took the championship.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|p=34}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Printz|first=John G.|title=U.S. 1894\u20131920: Short History|author2=Ken H.

Between a lack of European participation due to World War I and the growing American interest in oval racing, road racing fell by the wayside.

The starting grid included seven American drivers, but New Zealand's [[Bruce McLaren]], in a [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]], took his first win in F1 and was, at the time, the youngest driver ever to win a Grand Prix. McLaren took the lead on the last lap of the race when his team-mate, [[Jack Brabham]], ran out of fuel. Brabham had to push his car over the line to finish fourth. By virtue of [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]'s [[Tony Brooks (racing driver)|Tony Brooks]] finishing third, Brabham and Cooper took the Drivers' and Constructors' championships, respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|p=46}}</ref> Despite providing an exciting climax to the season, the race was not successful from the hosts' standpoint, the race's isolated location did not help the event's success as the promoters barely broke even.

[[Stirling Moss]] put on quite a show in his privately entered [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] by winning from pole position. However, while the driver's purse was enormous (as at Sebring), the event was no better received than the previous year's due to a lack of promotion, and proximity to the successful [[Los Angeles Times Grand Prix|Times Grand Prix]].<ref name=\"Nye 1978 47\"/> Again Moran and Cunningham would pay the prize money.<ref name=\"Capps 2000\"/>\n\n===Watkins Glen===\n{{tone|section|date=September 2018}}\n{{very long|section|date=September 2018}}\nThrough most of 1961, Ulmann was listed as the promoter of the USGP, and contacted organizers in [[Miami]] and [[Bill France, Sr.|Bill France]] of the [[Daytona International Speedway]] but was unable to reach agreements. In August, racing promoter [[Cameron Argetsinger]], Executive Director of the {{convert|2.35|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course]] located in the central Finger Lakes region of upstate [[New York (state)|New York]], offered his circuit to the [[Automobile Competition Committee for the United States]] (ACCUS) to host the Grand Prix. He succeeded and Watkins Glen would host the United States Grand Prix for the next 20 years. Over this time, the event became a tradition among the fans as loyal crowds gathered each autumn on the spread out hills of [[Upstate New York]]. It was one of the season's most popular events with the teams and drivers as well, receiving the Grand Prix Drivers' Association award for the best organized and best staged Grand Prix of the season in [[1965 United States Grand Prix|1965]], [[1970 United States Grand Prix|1970]], and [[1971 United States Grand Prix|1971]].{{fact|date=November 2019}} The isolated location of the track gave it a vacation-type atmosphere. Watkins Glen has the longest hosting record of any American Formula One race; the track became known as the \"Mecca\" of American road racing and it eventually wove itself into European Grand Prix racing culture.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|p=39}}</ref>\n\nWatkins Glen had hosted a series of [[Formula Libre]] events that attracted international entries. ACCUS accepted on August 28, leaving only six weeks to organize the event on October 8. Argetsinger assembled the field, but was unable to convince [[Scuderia Ferrari]] to make the trip, leaving [[Richie Ginther]] and recently crowned World Champion [[Phil Hill]] out of their home Grand Prix.<ref name=\"Capps 2000\"/> [[Innes Ireland]] took a surprise win, his first and the first for [[Team Lotus]]. [[Dan Gurney]]'s [[Porsche in Formula One|Porsche]] was second, and [[Tony Brooks (racing driver)|Tony Brooks]] was third in his final Grand Prix. [[Stirling Moss]], in his final Grand Prix, retired with engine problems. Unlike the previous two races, the race was well attended (over 60,000) and turned a profit. The Watkins Glen circuit had similarities to the British [[Brands Hatch]] circuit, in that a number of corners were banked and very fast and that the circuit was located in a very green part of the world.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|p=53}}</ref> The race purse was paid in cash, a popular move with the teams after the previous two years' payment issues.<ref name=\"Capps 2000\"/> Due to its position on the calendar near the end of the season, often either the final or penultimate round, championships were often decided before the event. In part to offset this, race organizers offered large sums of prize money; in 1969 the purse totaled $200,000 (with $50,000 for the winner),<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|p=85}}</ref> and when in 1972 it was raised to $275,000, the [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] team earned a record $100,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|pp=99\u2013100}}</ref>\n[[File:Hulme68.jpg|thumb|left|[[Denny Hulme]] in the [[1968 United States Grand Prix|1968 event]]]]\n1962 saw Briton Jim Clark win in a Lotus; the next three races were won by fellow-Briton Graham Hill, each time in a BRM. Hill's 1964 win was crucial to him as he carried a points advantage into the next and final race in Mexico. 1966 and 1967 saw Clark win; the '66 win was the only Formula One race he won that year, driving a Lotus with an overweight BRM H16 engine. Both the Drivers' and Constructors' championships were clinched by Australian [[Jack Brabham]] and his [[Brabham]] team. Clark dominated the 1967 event, leading comfortably from his teammate Hill and American Dan Gurney in an Eagle. In 1968 Mario Andretti put his Lotus 49 on pole position in his first ever Formula One race on a track he had never seen before. Andretti retired, and Briton Jackie Stewart won the race in a Ford/Cosworth powered Matra. Austrian Jochen Rindt won in 1969 \u2013 his first Formula One race win. He took advantage of Stewart's mechanical problems to pull a huge gap out on the rest of the field. Graham Hill had a much worse day, however. He punctured his car's rear right tire and the rubber came off the rim. The rubber exploded, sending Hill's Lotus cartwheeling off the course, and Hill was thrown out of the car, breaking both legs. 1970 saw Brazilian newcomer [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] win the race in only his fourth start in a Formula One race. Stewart retired his new Tyrrell and Fittipaldi, driving a Lotus, held off a charge from Mexican Pedro Rodriguez in a BRM. It was an emotional win for Colin Chapman's Lotus team, as team leader Rindt had been killed while practicing for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Lotus had not run the Canadian Grand Prix, but because the next closest championship contender [[Jacky Ickx]] did not score enough points to keep him in contention, the Drivers' Championship was won by Rindt posthumously at this race. Team Lotus also won the Constructors' Championship at the 1970 event.\n\n[[File:Wg ticket 1973.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ticket stub from the 1973 USGP]]\nIn 1971, the course was changed considerably. The entire lower section of the track was reconfigured, and a new section was constructed which added more than a mile to the course, lengthening it to {{convert|3.377|mi|km}}. It also saw a new pitlane and pit straight and three new corners (a new first, second-to last and last corners). The improvements cost nearly $2.5&nbsp;million ($13&nbsp;million in 2010 dollars).<ref>{{cite news|last=Britt|first=Bloys|title=29 Drivers To Test New Track|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jw9MAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KSQNAAAAIBAJ&pg=7060,5534003|accessdate=May 16, 2011|newspaper=[[Oxnard Press-Courier|The Press-Courier]]|date=September 26, 1971|location=Oxnard, California|page=28}}</ref> The alterations considerably heightened the driving challenge of the track, and it became even more popular than it had been with drivers, teams and fans.{{fact|date=November 2019}} Watkins Glen had been transformed from a quick, small circuit into a fast and very tough up-and-down circuit where just about every corner was banked and long; uncommonly hard driving and maximum effort was required for almost every part of a lap. 1971 was the first running on the completed full circuit (the circuit was not completed in time for previous races, so the completed short circuit was used) and it saw popular Frenchman [[Fran\u00e7ois Cevert]] win his only Grand Prix for Tyrrell, and the biggest cash prize in Formula One- $267,000. 1972 saw Jackie Stewart win after Emerson Fittipaldi had already won the championship at the previous race, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Cevert made it a Tyrrell 1\u20132. The race was at this point attracting lots of entries; 30 drivers entered and qualified for the 1972 race.\n\nJackie Stewart, unknown to almost everyone (including his wife Helen) had planned to retire after the 1973 race. He had already won his third Drivers' Championship two races previously at Monza and he would be running his 100th and final Grand Prix. But during qualifying, Stewart's teammate and friend Cevert was killed. Going into the nearly flat out uphill Esses, Cevert lost control and struck the barrier on the left side nearly head on at 150&nbsp;mph. The car vaulted over the barriers and Cevert was killed instantly. The marshals left Cevert in the car and threw a cover over the cockpit.{{fact|date=November 2019}} A distraught Stewart and his team's manager Ken Tyrrell withdrew the team, handing the Constructors' Championship to Lotus. Stewart retired with immediate effect. In the race, Swede Ronnie Peterson in a Lotus beat Briton driver James Hunt in a Hesketh-entered March to the finish by 0.6 of a second. American [[Peter Revson]] finished fifth at his home race.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fran\u00e7ois Cevert|url=http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&n=111|work=Motorsport Memorial|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe 1974 event was to decide the world championship between Fittipaldi and Swiss Clay Regazzoni, who had the same number of points. Regazzoni, driving a Ferrari, ran into a host of problems during the race and finished out of the points. Fittipaldi finished fifth which won him his second Drivers' Championship. The event was marred by yet another fatal accident. Austrian [[Helmut Koinigg]] crashed at the fast, long Outer Loop corner, the bend after the extended back straight on Lap 10. Koinigg's Surtees went straight on and the car went under the barriers, killing him instantly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helmuth Koinigg|url=http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&n=142|work=Motorsport Memorial|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}</ref> The race was a Brabham 1\u20132, with Argentine [[Carlos Reutemann]] winning with Brazilian [[Carlos Pace]] second. 1975 saw a medium speed chicane added to the Esses to slow the cars down. The race was a politically charged event. Regazzoni held up Fittipaldi's second placed McLaren for six laps to try to help his teammate and leader of the race [[Niki Lauda]] get ahead; Fittipaldi eventually lapped the Swiss. However, Regazzoni was black flagged by Clerk of the Course Berdie Martin, angering Ferrari team manager [[Luca di Montezemolo]], who withdrew Regazzoni in protest. Their other driver, recently crowned Drivers' Champion Lauda, went on to win from Fittipaldi.\n\n1976 saw James Hunt win crucially in a McLaren while his closest championship contender Lauda finished third. At this point, Hunt was only three points behind Lauda for the final race at Fuji, Japan. The race also saw Jacky Ickx crash at the Chute; the Belgian survived but was injured. 1977 saw rain throughout the race. Hunt won again on a wet track as he held off home favorite [[Mario Andretti]] in a [[Lotus 78]] to win by two seconds. The 1978 race took place two weeks after the death of Ronnie Peterson at Monza. Andretti had already accumulated enough points to win the Drivers' Championship before coming to Watkins Glen. Mechanical problems forced Andretti to retire early from the race, which was won by Carlos Reutemann in a [[Ferrari 312T3]]. 1979 saw Ferrari driver Gilles Villeneuve win a wet race after Australian Alan Jones retired after dominating much of the race.\n\nBy this time, Watkins Glen had begun to deteriorate. Drivers began complaining about the bumpy track surface, and the teams and press were concerned over facilities, the lackluster level of security and rowdy fans.<ref>{{cite news|title=Watkins Glen may lose|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TgQkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MO4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5307,883230|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=November 17, 1979|location=Spokane, Washington|page=24}}</ref> Race attendees began to go to the so-called \"Bog\", located inside the Boot, to set fire to objects and do other destructive things; cars and even a Greyhound bus in 1974 were burned there.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/07/archives/mob-at-the-glens-bog-burns-a-stolen-bus.html|title=Mob at The Glen's Bog Burns a Stolen Bus|last=|first=|date=October 7, 1974|work=|accessdate=February 2, 2020|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}</ref>{{fact|date=November 2019}} Even though the Bog was made into a parking lot in 1975, things still did not improve sufficiently over the years.{{fact|date=November 2019}} In 1978, the European motorsports governing body, FISA, demanded that the track owners make safety improvements to the track, which were made; and then the event was due to be cancelled for the 1980 season, but it was given a reprieve by FISA after promising to upgrade facilities over the winter.<ref>{{cite news|title=Grand Prix Alive at Watkins Glen|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J5djAAAAIBAJ&sjid=f3oNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4229,4705755|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[The Star-Phoenix]]|date=December 13, 1979|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|location=Saskatoon|page=D4}}</ref> After initially being given an April 13 date on the calendar, the race was moved to October 5.<ref>{{cite news|title=Watkins Glen Will Be Site For Grand Prix|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BDEaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oCQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5233,3515827|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|The Times-News]]|date=February 4, 1980|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|location=Hendersonville, North Carolina|page=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Mike|title=Long Beach hosts event|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LTwtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=p74EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6169,2524268|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[The Rock Hill Herald]]|date=March 24, 1980|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|location=Rock Hill, South Carolina|page=6}}</ref> Organizers were finally able to secure funding for circuit improvements in late August, and the track was resurfaced.<ref>{{cite news|title=Watkins Glen May Have Found 'Angel'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QNFKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oOkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3402,10257112|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[Schenectady Gazette]]|date=August 29, 1980|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|page=17}}</ref> But they still needed a $750,000 loan from the [[Formula One Constructors Association]] (FOCA) to pay prize money and other expenses.<ref name=\"Boca Breeze\">{{cite news|title=Watkins Glen loses sanction|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LyJUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gY0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5837,1600806|accessdate=May 16, 2011|newspaper=[[Boca Raton News]]|date=May 8, 1981|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|page=10B}}</ref> [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] won the [[1980 United States Grand Prix|1980 race]] for [[Williams F1|Williams]] after he went off at the first corner on the first lap and charged through the field into second place from 17th, and he ended up taking the checkered flag after pole sitter [[Bruno Giacomelli]] retired with electrical problems near the Chute.

After Watkins Glen's demise, other Formula One Grands Prix in the United States were briefly held on street circuits in Detroit and Dallas, and a car park in Las Vegas. The Detroit Grand Prix was the longest lasting, from 1982 to 1988; plans to continue Formula One races in Detroit at [[Belle Isle Park]] did not materialize, and in 1989, Formula One moved to the [[Sonoran Desert]] city of [[Phoenix, Arizona]], bringing the United States Grand Prix name back for the first time since 1980.<ref>{{cite news|last=Siano|first=Joseph|title=Auto Racing; Grand Prix Moves to Phoenix|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/30/sports/auto-racing-grand-prix-moves-to-phoenix.html|accessdate=May 18, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 30, 1989|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618040757/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/30/sports/auto-racing-grand-prix-moves-to-phoenix.html|archivedate=June 18, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The [[Phoenix street circuit]] in the centre of the city was unpopular with drivers and the event was largely ignored by the local populace. Phoenix, like many American cities was designed on the grid system, the circuit was made up entirely of 2nd gear 90-degree corners and provided nearly no driving challenge or exciting corners to watch cars go around. The circuit was less bumpy and wider than Detroit, and its long straights made it easy to overtake and difficult to judge braking.\n\nThe inaugural event in 1989 was held at short notice and it could only be held in June (Detroit's former date), one of the hottest months of Phoenix \u2013 a city with summer temperatures regularly going past {{convert|110|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Temperatures neared {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} on race weekend. Out of 40,000 capacity, 34,441 tickets were sold. Ecclestone expected the event to be sold out but was told that local populace avoids outdoor events during summer.<ref>Charles Kelly, The Arizona Republic Promoters happy despite the surprise of low attendance June 5, 1989</ref> The race was moved to March for 1990, as the opening round of the season, for the next two years. The [[McLaren]] team dominated all three years, with [[Alain Prost]] winning in 1989 and [[Ayrton Senna]] in 1990 and 1991. The 1989 race saw Prost win his only Grand Prix in the United States by taking advantage of Senna's engine electronics problems.  The 1990 race saw emerging French star [[Jean Alesi]] harrying Senna for a number of laps; the Tyrrell driver went on to finish second behind Senna. The circuit had to be changed for 1991 race due to the construction of a new Phoenix Suns basketball arena, and the revised circuit was generally seen to be an improvement. Senna won the race from pole position. On October 7, 1991, members of International Auto Sport Federation (FISA) met to discuss the agenda for the 1992 Formula One season, where they voted to cancel the contract with city of Phoenix.

Six American drivers have won the United States Grand Prix, all except one when it was known as the American Grand Prize, which was not part of the Grand Prix calendar. Chuck Daigh also won it as a non-championship race at Riverside in 1958. But while the event has been part of the Formula One World Championship, no American has won the event; however [[Mario Andretti]] won the [[1977 United States Grand Prix West]] in Long Beach, California.\n\n===Repeat winners (drivers)===\nDrivers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.

The race later became part of the [[Formula One]] World Championship. {{As of|2018}}, the race has been held 48 times, and it has taken place at 10 different locations in total. Since 2012, it has been held every year at the [[Circuit of the Americas]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings and the Vanderbilt Cup===\nInspired by the [[Gordon Bennett Cup (auto racing)|Gordon Bennett Cup]] and [[Circuit des Ardennes (motor racing)|Circuit des Ardennes]] races he had competed in, [[William Kissam Vanderbilt]] founded a series of road races in the United States to showcase American road racing to the world. The [[Vanderbilt Cup]] soon became an institution on New York's [[Long Island]], attracting American and European competitors alike. However, the race was plagued by crowd control problems, which led to spectator deaths and injuries, and the cancellation of the 1907 event. Upon its return for 1908, the [[American Automobile Association]] did not adopt the new Grand Prix regulations agreed upon by the ''[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|Association Internationale des Automobiles Clubs Reconnus]]'' (AIACR).<ref name=\"Etzrodt\">{{cite web |last=Etzrodt |first=Hans |title=Grand Prix Winners 1895\u20131949.

The race came down to a three-way battle between the Benz of [[Victor H\u00e9mery]] and the Fiats of [[Louis Wagner (driver)|Louis Wagner]] and [[Felice Nazzaro]]. Wagner won the race by the close margin of 56 seconds.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|pp=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nDespite the success of the Savannah event, it was decided that the 1909 race would be held on Long Island, in conjunction with the Vanderbilt Cup. However, only the Vanderbilt race was held and the Grand Prize pushed back to the next year. After the 1910 Vanderbilt Cup saw more issues, including the deaths of two riding mechanics and several serious spectator injuries, the Grand Prize was cancelled once again. A last-minute request by the Savannah club saved the race for the year, but only gave one month to prepare the course. A shorter {{convert|17|mi|km|adj=on}} course was laid out, but due to the short notice, most European teams were not able to make the trip. The leading trio from 1908 did make it and American [[David Bruce-Brown]] joined the Benz squad. Bruce-Brown won another incredibly tight race over teammate H\u00e9mery, this time by only 1.42 seconds.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|pp=16\u201318}}</ref> The 1911 event returned to Savannah, and this time the Vanderbilt Cup came with it; the Cup and Grand Prize were to be held together until 1916. Despite the success of the events, public pressure started to mount on the organizers. The use of convict labor and the militia drew criticism, as did the nuisance of closing roads for the event.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|p=26}}</ref> Two accidents on the open roads in practice, one resulting in the death of Jay McNay, cast a shadow over the event. The American entries dominated the support events and ran well throughout the Grand Prize, after poor showings in past years and once again Bruce-Brown triumphed, this time driving a Fiat.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|p=25}}</ref>\n\nFor 1912, Savannah succumbed to public pressure, and [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], won the bid for the race. A narrow, {{convert|7.88|mi|km|adj=on}} trapezoidal course was set up on the outskirts of the city, in [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]]. As in 1911, tragedy struck in practice when David Bruce-Brown was killed after a puncture sent him off the road. On the final lap of the race, [[Ralph DePalma]] collided with eventual winner [[Caleb Bragg]], seriously injuring DePalma and his mechanic and ending any chance of a second race at Milwaukee.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|pp=26\u201328}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1915 American Grand Prize grid 1.jpg|thumb|The grid for the 1915 Grand Prize in San Francisco]]\n\nThe Grand Prize was not held in 1913, after Long Island's bid was rejected and Savannah refused to provide sufficient prize money. [[Board track racing|Oval racing on board tracks]] had taken off in the United States, to the detriment of road racing. For 1914, the Grand Prize and Vanderbilt Cup were staged in [[Santa Monica, California]] near [[Los Angeles]], on an {{convert|8.4|mi|km|adj=on}} course, with the start/finish straight along the Pacific Ocean. The field was primarily American entries (twelve, against five European entries), and the Americans dominated, with [[Eddie Pullen]]'s [[Mercer (car)|Mercer]] winning by over 40 seconds.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|pp=29\u201331}}</ref> In 1915, the race shifted to San Francisco, in conjunction with the [[Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition]]. With the outbreak of World War I in Europe, almost all of the drivers and cars were American, except for a few cars imported earlier. The {{convert|3.84|mi|km|adj=on}} course was set up around the Exposition grounds and nearby oval track with a boarded main straightaway. Heavy rain began two hours into the race, covering the circuit in mud from the extensive flower arrangements, and warping the main straight's boards. [[Dario Resta]] in a [[Peugeot]] cruised to a seven-minute victory, and followed up a week later by winning the Vanderbilt Cup.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|pp=32\u201333}}</ref> For 1916, the Grand Prize returned to Santa Monica. The race would be a part of the [[1916 AAA Championship Car season|AAA National Championship]], which carried a 4.91-liter displacement limit. Although the limit for the Grand Prize was 7.37 liters, no large-displacement cars would enter. The race was the penultimate round of the championship, with Dario Resta leading [[Johnny Aitken]] after his Vanderbilt Cup win. However, both cars would be out before halfway. Although Aitken took over teammate [[Howdy Wilcox]]'s car for the win, the AAA awarded points only to Wilcox, and Resta took the championship.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|p=34}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Printz|first=John G.|title=U.S. 1894\u20131920: Short History|author2=Ken H.

Between a lack of European participation due to World War I and the growing American interest in oval racing, road racing fell by the wayside.

It was one of the season's most popular events with the teams and drivers as well, receiving the Grand Prix Drivers' Association award for the best organized and best staged Grand Prix of the season in [[1965 United States Grand Prix|1965]], [[1970 United States Grand Prix|1970]], and [[1971 United States Grand Prix|1971]].{{fact|date=November 2019}} The isolated location of the track gave it a vacation-type atmosphere. Watkins Glen has the longest hosting record of any American Formula One race; the track became known as the \"Mecca\" of American road racing and it eventually wove itself into European Grand Prix racing culture.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|p=39}}</ref>\n\nWatkins Glen had hosted a series of [[Formula Libre]] events that attracted international entries. ACCUS accepted on August 28, leaving only six weeks to organize the event on October 8. Argetsinger assembled the field, but was unable to convince [[Scuderia Ferrari]] to make the trip, leaving [[Richie Ginther]] and recently crowned World Champion [[Phil Hill]] out of their home Grand Prix.<ref name=\"Capps 2000\"/> [[Innes Ireland]] took a surprise win, his first and the first for [[Team Lotus]]. [[Dan Gurney]]'s [[Porsche in Formula One|Porsche]] was second, and [[Tony Brooks (racing driver)|Tony Brooks]] was third in his final Grand Prix. [[Stirling Moss]], in his final Grand Prix, retired with engine problems. Unlike the previous two races, the race was well attended (over 60,000) and turned a profit. The Watkins Glen circuit had similarities to the British [[Brands Hatch]] circuit, in that a number of corners were banked and very fast and that the circuit was located in a very green part of the world.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|p=53}}</ref> The race purse was paid in cash, a popular move with the teams after the previous two years' payment issues.<ref name=\"Capps 2000\"/> Due to its position on the calendar near the end of the season, often either the final or penultimate round, championships were often decided before the event. In part to offset this, race organizers offered large sums of prize money; in 1969 the purse totaled $200,000 (with $50,000 for the winner),<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|p=85}}</ref> and when in 1972 it was raised to $275,000, the [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] team earned a record $100,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1978|pp=99\u2013100}}</ref>\n[[File:Hulme68.jpg|thumb|left|[[Denny Hulme]] in the [[1968 United States Grand Prix|1968 event]]]]\n1962 saw Briton Jim Clark win in a Lotus; the next three races were won by fellow-Briton Graham Hill, each time in a BRM. Hill's 1964 win was crucial to him as he carried a points advantage into the next and final race in Mexico. 1966 and 1967 saw Clark win; the '66 win was the only Formula One race he won that year, driving a Lotus with an overweight BRM H16 engine. Both the Drivers' and Constructors' championships were clinched by Australian [[Jack Brabham]] and his [[Brabham]] team. Clark dominated the 1967 event, leading comfortably from his teammate Hill and American Dan Gurney in an Eagle. In 1968 Mario Andretti put his Lotus 49 on pole position in his first ever Formula One race on a track he had never seen before. Andretti retired, and Briton Jackie Stewart won the race in a Ford/Cosworth powered Matra. Austrian Jochen Rindt won in 1969 \u2013 his first Formula One race win. He took advantage of Stewart's mechanical problems to pull a huge gap out on the rest of the field. Graham Hill had a much worse day, however. He punctured his car's rear right tire and the rubber came off the rim. The rubber exploded, sending Hill's Lotus cartwheeling off the course, and Hill was thrown out of the car, breaking both legs. 1970 saw Brazilian newcomer [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] win the race in only his fourth start in a Formula One race. Stewart retired his new Tyrrell and Fittipaldi, driving a Lotus, held off a charge from Mexican Pedro Rodriguez in a BRM. It was an emotional win for Colin Chapman's Lotus team, as team leader Rindt had been killed while practicing for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Lotus had not run the Canadian Grand Prix, but because the next closest championship contender [[Jacky Ickx]] did not score enough points to keep him in contention, the Drivers' Championship was won by Rindt posthumously at this race. Team Lotus also won the Constructors' Championship at the 1970 event.\n\n[[File:Wg ticket 1973.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ticket stub from the 1973 USGP]]\nIn 1971, the course was changed considerably. The entire lower section of the track was reconfigured, and a new section was constructed which added more than a mile to the course, lengthening it to {{convert|3.377|mi|km}}. It also saw a new pitlane and pit straight and three new corners (a new first, second-to last and last corners). The improvements cost nearly $2.5&nbsp;million ($13&nbsp;million in 2010 dollars).<ref>{{cite news|last=Britt|first=Bloys|title=29 Drivers To Test New Track|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jw9MAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KSQNAAAAIBAJ&pg=7060,5534003|accessdate=May 16, 2011|newspaper=[[Oxnard Press-Courier|The Press-Courier]]|date=September 26, 1971|location=Oxnard, California|page=28}}</ref> The alterations considerably heightened the driving challenge of the track, and it became even more popular than it had been with drivers, teams and fans.{{fact|date=November 2019}} Watkins Glen had been transformed from a quick, small circuit into a fast and very tough up-and-down circuit where just about every corner was banked and long; uncommonly hard driving and maximum effort was required for almost every part of a lap. 1971 was the first running on the completed full circuit (the circuit was not completed in time for previous races, so the completed short circuit was used) and it saw popular Frenchman [[Fran\u00e7ois Cevert]] win his only Grand Prix for Tyrrell, and the biggest cash prize in Formula One- $267,000. 1972 saw Jackie Stewart win after Emerson Fittipaldi had already won the championship at the previous race, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Cevert made it a Tyrrell 1\u20132. The race was at this point attracting lots of entries; 30 drivers entered and qualified for the 1972 race.\n\nJackie Stewart, unknown to almost everyone (including his wife Helen) had planned to retire after the 1973 race. He had already won his third Drivers' Championship two races previously at Monza and he would be running his 100th and final Grand Prix. But during qualifying, Stewart's teammate and friend Cevert was killed. Going into the nearly flat out uphill Esses, Cevert lost control and struck the barrier on the left side nearly head on at 150&nbsp;mph. The car vaulted over the barriers and Cevert was killed instantly. The marshals left Cevert in the car and threw a cover over the cockpit.{{fact|date=November 2019}} A distraught Stewart and his team's manager Ken Tyrrell withdrew the team, handing the Constructors' Championship to Lotus. Stewart retired with immediate effect. In the race, Swede Ronnie Peterson in a Lotus beat Briton driver James Hunt in a Hesketh-entered March to the finish by 0.6 of a second. American [[Peter Revson]] finished fifth at his home race.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fran\u00e7ois Cevert|url=http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&n=111|work=Motorsport Memorial|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe 1974 event was to decide the world championship between Fittipaldi and Swiss Clay Regazzoni, who had the same number of points. Regazzoni, driving a Ferrari, ran into a host of problems during the race and finished out of the points. Fittipaldi finished fifth which won him his second Drivers' Championship. The event was marred by yet another fatal accident. Austrian [[Helmut Koinigg]] crashed at the fast, long Outer Loop corner, the bend after the extended back straight on Lap 10. Koinigg's Surtees went straight on and the car went under the barriers, killing him instantly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helmuth Koinigg|url=http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&n=142|work=Motorsport Memorial|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}</ref> The race was a Brabham 1\u20132, with Argentine [[Carlos Reutemann]] winning with Brazilian [[Carlos Pace]] second. 1975 saw a medium speed chicane added to the Esses to slow the cars down. The race was a politically charged event. Regazzoni held up Fittipaldi's second placed McLaren for six laps to try to help his teammate and leader of the race [[Niki Lauda]] get ahead; Fittipaldi eventually lapped the Swiss. However, Regazzoni was black flagged by Clerk of the Course Berdie Martin, angering Ferrari team manager [[Luca di Montezemolo]], who withdrew Regazzoni in protest. Their other driver, recently crowned Drivers' Champion Lauda, went on to win from Fittipaldi.\n\n1976 saw James Hunt win crucially in a McLaren while his closest championship contender Lauda finished third. At this point, Hunt was only three points behind Lauda for the final race at Fuji, Japan. The race also saw Jacky Ickx crash at the Chute; the Belgian survived but was injured. 1977 saw rain throughout the race. Hunt won again on a wet track as he held off home favorite [[Mario Andretti]] in a [[Lotus 78]] to win by two seconds. The 1978 race took place two weeks after the death of Ronnie Peterson at Monza. Andretti had already accumulated enough points to win the Drivers' Championship before coming to Watkins Glen. Mechanical problems forced Andretti to retire early from the race, which was won by Carlos Reutemann in a [[Ferrari 312T3]]. 1979 saw Ferrari driver Gilles Villeneuve win a wet race after Australian Alan Jones retired after dominating much of the race.\n\nBy this time, Watkins Glen had begun to deteriorate. Drivers began complaining about the bumpy track surface, and the teams and press were concerned over facilities, the lackluster level of security and rowdy fans.<ref>{{cite news|title=Watkins Glen may lose|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TgQkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MO4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5307,883230|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=November 17, 1979|location=Spokane, Washington|page=24}}</ref> Race attendees began to go to the so-called \"Bog\", located inside the Boot, to set fire to objects and do other destructive things; cars and even a Greyhound bus in 1974 were burned there.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/07/archives/mob-at-the-glens-bog-burns-a-stolen-bus.html|title=Mob at The Glen's Bog Burns a Stolen Bus|last=|first=|date=October 7, 1974|work=|accessdate=February 2, 2020|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}</ref>{{fact|date=November 2019}} Even though the Bog was made into a parking lot in 1975, things still did not improve sufficiently over the years.{{fact|date=November 2019}} In 1978, the European motorsports governing body, FISA, demanded that the track owners make safety improvements to the track, which were made; and then the event was due to be cancelled for the 1980 season, but it was given a reprieve by FISA after promising to upgrade facilities over the winter.<ref>{{cite news|title=Grand Prix Alive at Watkins Glen|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J5djAAAAIBAJ&sjid=f3oNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4229,4705755|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[The Star-Phoenix]]|date=December 13, 1979|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|location=Saskatoon|page=D4}}</ref> After initially being given an April 13 date on the calendar, the race was moved to October 5.<ref>{{cite news|title=Watkins Glen Will Be Site For Grand Prix|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BDEaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oCQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5233,3515827|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|The Times-News]]|date=February 4, 1980|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|location=Hendersonville, North Carolina|page=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Mike|title=Long Beach hosts event|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LTwtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=p74EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6169,2524268|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[The Rock Hill Herald]]|date=March 24, 1980|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|location=Rock Hill, South Carolina|page=6}}</ref> Organizers were finally able to secure funding for circuit improvements in late August, and the track was resurfaced.<ref>{{cite news|title=Watkins Glen May Have Found 'Angel'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QNFKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oOkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3402,10257112|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[Schenectady Gazette]]|date=August 29, 1980|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|page=17}}</ref> But they still needed a $750,000 loan from the [[Formula One Constructors Association]] (FOCA) to pay prize money and other expenses.<ref name=\"Boca Breeze\">{{cite news|title=Watkins Glen loses sanction|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LyJUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gY0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5837,1600806|accessdate=May 16, 2011|newspaper=[[Boca Raton News]]|date=May 8, 1981|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|page=10B}}</ref> [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] won the [[1980 United States Grand Prix|1980 race]] for [[Williams F1|Williams]] after he went off at the first corner on the first lap and charged through the field into second place from 17th, and he ended up taking the checkered flag after pole sitter [[Bruno Giacomelli]] retired with electrical problems near the Chute.

After Watkins Glen's demise, other Formula One Grands Prix in the United States were briefly held on street circuits in Detroit and Dallas, and a car park in Las Vegas. The Detroit Grand Prix was the longest lasting, from 1982 to 1988; plans to continue Formula One races in Detroit at [[Belle Isle Park]] did not materialize, and in 1989, Formula One moved to the [[Sonoran Desert]] city of [[Phoenix, Arizona]], bringing the United States Grand Prix name back for the first time since 1980.<ref>{{cite news|last=Siano|first=Joseph|title=Auto Racing; Grand Prix Moves to Phoenix|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/30/sports/auto-racing-grand-prix-moves-to-phoenix.html|accessdate=May 18, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 30, 1989|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618040757/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/30/sports/auto-racing-grand-prix-moves-to-phoenix.html|archivedate=June 18, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The [[Phoenix street circuit]] in the centre of the city was unpopular with drivers and the event was largely ignored by the local populace. Phoenix, like many American cities was designed on the grid system, the circuit was made up entirely of 2nd gear 90-degree corners and provided nearly no driving challenge or exciting corners to watch cars go around. The circuit was less bumpy and wider than Detroit, and its long straights made it easy to overtake and difficult to judge braking.\n\nThe inaugural event in 1989 was held at short notice and it could only be held in June (Detroit's former date), one of the hottest months of Phoenix \u2013 a city with summer temperatures regularly going past {{convert|110|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Temperatures neared {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} on race weekend. Out of 40,000 capacity, 34,441 tickets were sold. Ecclestone expected the event to be sold out but was told that local populace avoids outdoor events during summer.<ref>Charles Kelly, The Arizona Republic Promoters happy despite the surprise of low attendance June 5, 1989</ref> The race was moved to March for 1990, as the opening round of the season, for the next two years. The [[McLaren]] team dominated all three years, with [[Alain Prost]] winning in 1989 and [[Ayrton Senna]] in 1990 and 1991. The 1989 race saw Prost win his only Grand Prix in the United States by taking advantage of Senna's engine electronics problems.  The 1990 race saw emerging French star [[Jean Alesi]] harrying Senna for a number of laps; the Tyrrell driver went on to finish second behind Senna. The circuit had to be changed for 1991 race due to the construction of a new Phoenix Suns basketball arena, and the revised circuit was generally seen to be an improvement. Senna won the race from pole position. On October 7, 1991, members of International Auto Sport Federation (FISA) met to discuss the agenda for the 1992 Formula One season, where they voted to cancel the contract with city of Phoenix. That same year, Phoenix assistant city manager David Garcia said the city had already invested $1.3&nbsp;million dollars preparing for 1992 race and was in negotiations with Ecclestone on contract cancelation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=932&dat=19911007&id=k5omAAAAIBAJ&sjid=q1MDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5884,4701482&hl=en|title=Phoenix may lose Formula One auto race|date=October 7, 1991|work=Kingman Daily Miner|accessdate=June 29, 2016}}</ref> Ecclestone was asked if poor attendance was to blame for the Phoenix race pull out, he said that attendance was never a problem but ability to place more than 20,000 seats in a way where fans can have a better view.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/december-1996/26/forlorn-usa |title=Article|date=1996 |website=www.motorsportmagazine.com|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref> There were rumors of a race on the streets of the [[Manhattan]] borough of [[New York City]] for 1992 and a race on the streets of the Las Vegas strip for 1995 but these never materialized and a Formula 1 event would not be held in United States for the next 9 years.\n\n===Indianapolis===\n[[File:flag crowd.jpg|thumb|left|Crowds at the inaugural running of the United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis exceeded 200,000]]\n\nIt was not until [[2000 United States Grand Prix|2000]] that another United States Grand Prix took place, this time at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] in Indiana.
