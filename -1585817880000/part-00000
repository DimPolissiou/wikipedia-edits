Invariably these are images of [[Jesus]] or the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. The most notable examples that are credited by tradition among the faithful are, in the Eastern church the Mandylion,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSX5DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Tradition of the Image of Edessa|last=Guscin|first=Mark|date=2016-02-08|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443888752|location=|pages=137|language=en}}</ref> also known as the [[Image of Edessa]], and the [[Hodegetria]] (depending on the version of their origin stories followed\u2014in many versions both are painted by human painters of Jesus or Mary while alive), and several Russian icons, and in the West the [[Shroud of Turin]], [[Veil of Veronica]], [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], and [[Manoppello Image]].  The term is also used of icons that are only regarded as normal human copies of a miraculously created original archetype.\n\nAlthough the most famous ''acheiropoieta'' today are mostly [[icon]]s in paint on wood panel, they exist with other medium, such as [[mosaic]]s, painted tile, and cloth.  [[Ernst Kitzinger]] distinguished two types: \"Either they are images believed to have been made by hands other than those of ordinary mortals or else they are claimed to be mechanical, though miraculous, impressions of the original\".<ref>Kitzinger, 113</ref>  The belief in such images becomes prominent only in the 6th century, by the end of which both the Mandylion and the Image of [[Camuliana]] were well known.  The pilgrim [[Antoninus of Piacenza (pilgrim)|Antoninus of Piacenza]] was shown a relic of the [[Veil of Veronica]] type in [[Memphis, Egypt]] in the 570s.<ref>Kitzinger, 113-114</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Eternal father painting guadalupe.jpg|thumb|right|[[God the Father]] painting [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], an unusual [[Marian art in the Catholic Church|Marian image]], 18th century.]]\nSuch images functioned as powerful [[relic]]s as well as icons, and their images were naturally seen as especially authoritative as to the true appearance of the subject.  Like other icon types believed to be painted from the live subject, such as the [[Hodegetria]] (thought to have been painted by [[Luke the Evangelist]]), they therefore acted as important references for other images in the tradition.  They therefore were copied on an enormous scale, and the belief that such images existed, and authenticated certain facial types, played an important role in the conservatism of [[iconography|iconographic]] traditions such as the [[Depiction of Jesus]].<ref name=\"Grigg, throughout\">Grigg, throughout</ref>  Beside, and conflated with, the developed legend of the Image of Edessa, was the tale of the Veil of Veronica, whose name was wrongly interpreted in a typical case of [[popular etymology]] to mean \"true icon\" or \"true image\", the fear of a \"false image\" remaining strong.\n\n===Conventional images believed to be authentic===\nA further and larger group of images, sometimes overlapping with acheiropoieta in popular tradition, were believed in the [[Early Middle Ages]] to have been created by conventional means in New Testament times, often by New Testament figures who, like many monks of the later period, were believed to have practiced as artists.  The best known of these, and the most commonly credited in the West, was Saint Luke, who was long believed to have had the Virgin Mary sit for her portrait, but in the East a number of other figures were believed by many to have created images, including narrative ones. [[Saint Peter]] was said to have \"illustrated his own account of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]]\", Luke to have illustrated an entire [[Gospel Book]], and the late 7th century [[Franks|Frankish]] pilgrim [[Arculf]] reported seeing in the [[Holy Land]] a cloth woven or embroidered by the Virgin herself with figures of Jesus and the apostles.  The apostles were also said to have been very active as patrons, commissioning cycles in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[fresco]] in their churches.<ref name=\"Grigg, 5-6, 5 quoted\">Grigg, 5-6, 5 quoted</ref>\n\nSuch beliefs clearly projected contemporary practices back to the 1st century, and in their developed form are not found before the lead-up to the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic Controversy]], but in the 4th century, [[Eusebius]], who disapproved of images, accepted that \"the features of His apostles Peter and Paul, and indeed of Christ himself, have been preserved in coloured portraits which I have examined\".<ref name=\"Grigg, 5-6, 5 quoted\"/>  Many famous images, including the Image of Edessa and Hodegetria, were described in versions of their stories as this type of image.  The belief that images presumably of the 6th century at the earliest were authentic products of the 1st century distorted any sense of stylistic anachronism, making it easier for further images to be accepted, just as the belief in acheiropoieta, which must have reflected a divine standard of realism and accuracy, distorted early medieval perceptions of what degree of realism was possible in art, accounting for the praise very frequently given to images for their realism, when to modern eyes the surviving corpus has little of this.  The standard depictions of both the features of the leading New Testament figures, and the [[iconography]] of key narrative scenes, seemed to have their authenticity confirmed by images believed to have been created either by direct witnesses or those able to hear the accounts of witnesses, or alternatively God himself or his angels.<ref name=\"Grigg, throughout\"/>\n\n==Acheiropoieta of 836==\nSuch icons were seen as powerful arguments against [[iconoclasm]]. In a document{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} apparently produced in the circle of the Patriarch of Constantinople, which purports to be the record of a (fictitious){{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Ecumenical council|Church council]] of 836, a list of ''acheiropoieta'' and icons miraculously protected is given as evidence for divine approval of icons. The ''acheiropoieta'' listed are:\n\n:1. the [[Image of Edessa]], described as still at [[Edessa]];\n:2. the image of the Virgin at [[Lod]], Israel, which was said to have miraculously appeared imprinted on a column of a church built by the apostles Peter and John;\n:3. another image of the Virgin, three [[cubit]]s high, at Lod in Israel, which was said to have miraculously appeared in another church.\n\nThe nine other miracles listed deal with the maintenance rather than creation of icons, which resist or repair the attacks of assorted pagans, Arabs, Persians, scoffers, madmen, iconoclasts and Jews.\n\nThis list seems to have had a regional bias, as other then-famous images are not mentioned, such as the ''Image of Camuliana'',<ref name=\"Mango1986\">{{cite book|last=Mango|first=Cyril A.|title=The Art of the Byzantine Empire 312-1453: Sources and Documents|url=https://archive.org/details/artofbyzantine00mang|url-access=registration|year=1986|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-6627-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/artofbyzantine00mang/page/115 115]\u2013}}</ref> later brought to the capital. Another example, and the only one which indisputably still exists, is a mosaic of the young Christ from the sixth century in the church of Latomos Monastery in [[Thessaloniki]] (now dedicated to Saint David). This was apparently covered by plaster during the Iconoclastic period, towards the end of which an earthquake caused the plaster to fall down, revealing the image (during the reign of Leo V, 813-20). However, this was only a subsidiary miracle, according to the account{{by whom|date=July 2014}} we have. This says that the mosaic was being constructed secretly, during the 4th century persecution of [[Galerius]], as an image of the Virgin, when it suddenly was transformed overnight into the present image of Christ.<ref>Grigg, 6; Cormac</ref>\n\n==Notable examples==\n[[File:Abgarwithimageofedessa10thcentury.jpg|210px|thumb|right|10th century depiction of the legend of King Abgarus]]\n\n{{see also|Holy Face of Jesus}}\n\n===Image of Edessa===\n{{main|Image of Edessa}}\nAccording to Christian legend, the image of Edessa, (known to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] as the ''Mandylion'', a Medieval Greek word not applied in any other context), was a holy relic consisting of a square or rectangle of cloth upon which a miraculous image of the face of Jesus was imprinted &mdash; the first [[icon]] (\"image\"). According to legend, [[Abgar V]] wrote to Jesus, asking him to come cure him of an illness. Abgar received an answering letter from Jesus, declining the invitation, but promising a future visit by one of his disciples. Along with the letter went a likeness of Jesus. This legend was first recorded in the early fourth century by Eusebius,<ref>Eusebius, ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiae]]'' 1.13.5 and .22.</ref> who said that he had transcribed and translated the actual letter in the Syriac chancery documents of the king of Edessa. Instead, [[Thaddeus of Edessa]], one of the [[seventy disciples]], is said to have come to Edessa, bearing the words of Jesus, by the virtues of which the king was miraculously healed.\n\nThe first record of the existence of a physical image in the ancient city of [[Edessa]] (now [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa]]) was in [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], writing about 600, who reports a portrait of Christ, of divine origin (\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), which effected the miraculous aid in the defence of Edessa against the Persians in 544.<ref>Evagrius, in [[Jacques Paul Migne]], ''Patrologia Graeca''lxxxvi, 2, cols. 2748f, noted by Runciman 1931, p. 240, note 5; remarking that \"the portrait of Christ has entered the class of \u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 icons\".</ref> The image was moved to [[Constantinople]] in the 10th century. The cloth disappeared from Constantinople during the [[Fourth Crusade]] [Sack of Constantinople] in 1204, reappearing as a relic in King [[Louis IX of France]]'s [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in [[Paris]]. It finally disappeared in the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=\"artnet1931\">Two documentary inventories: year 1534 (Gerard of St. Quentin de l'Isle, Paris) and year 1740.

To art historians, it is a Georgian icon of the 6th-7th century.\n\n===Image of Camuliana===\n{{Main|Camuliana}}\nThough it is now little known, having probably been destroyed in the period of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]],<ref>Beckwith, 88, although Heinrich Pfeiffer identifies it with the [[Veil of Veronica]] and [[Manoppello Image]]:Heinrich Pfeiffer, \"The concept of \"acheiropoietos\", the iconography of the face of Christ and the veil of Manoppello\", in di Lazzaro, [http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/PfeifferWeb.pdf]</ref>)  the icon of Christ from [[Camuliana]] in [[Cappadocia]] was the most famous Greek example, certainly from the time it reached Constantinople in 574, after which it was used as a [[palladium (protective image)|palladium]] in battles by [[Philippicus (general)|Philippikos]], [[Priscus (general)|Priscus]] and [[Heraclius]], and in the [[Pannonian Avars|Pannonian Avar]] [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|Siege of Constantinople in 626]], and praised by [[George Pisida]].<ref>Kitzinger, 111-112; Emerick, 356-357. Most fully covered by Von Dobsch\u00fctz, like most of the images here</ref>\n\n=== Lateran Palace Image in Rome ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Acheiropoieton.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Detail of the image now in the [[Lateran Palace]].]] -->\n\nThis image, also called the Uronica,<ref>B.M. Bolton, \"Advertise the Message: Images in Rome at the Turn of the Twelfth Century\", in D. Wood (ed) ''The Church and the Arts'' (Oxford, 1992) p. 117</ref> is kept in what was once the pope's private chapel, in a room now known as the [[Sancta Sanctorum]] at the top of the [[Scala Sancta]] in a surviving part of the old [[Lateran Palace]] in Rome. The legend is that this image was begun by Luke the Evangelist and finished by angels. \n \nIt is thought that the icon was painted in Rome between the 5th and 6th century. Today only slight traces under [[overpainting]] remain of the original image of a [[Christ in Majesty]] with a crossed [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], in the classic pose of the Teacher holding the Scroll of the Law in His left hand while His right is raised in benediction. Many times restored, the face completely changed when [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159\u20131181) had the present one, painted on silk, placed over the original. [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1189\u20131216) covered the rest of the holy icon with an embossed silver [[riza]], but other later embellishments completely covered its surface. It has also been cleaned during the recent restoration. \n[[File:Acheropita lateranense.jpg|thumb|left|The image in its setting in the Pontifical Sanctuary of the [[Holy Stairs]], Rome.]]\n\nThe doors protecting the icon, also in embossed silver, are of the 15th century. It has a [[baldachin]] in metal and gilded wood over it, replacing the one by Caradaossi (1452\u20131527) lost during the sack of Rome in 1527. The image itself was last inspected by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] art historian J. Wilpert in 1907.<ref>Bolton, ''ibid.'' p. 120</ref>\n\nAs early as the reign of [[Pope Sergius I]] (687\u2013701) there are records of the image being carried in annual procession at certain feasts, and [[Pope Stephen II]] (752\u2013757) carried the image on his shoulders in a procession to counter a threat from the [[Lombards]]. By the ninth century its elaborate procession had become a focus of the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]]. In the Middle Ages the Pope and the seven [[Cardinal (Roman Catholic)|cardinal-bishops]] would celebrate masses in the small sanctuary where it was housed, and at times would kiss its feet.<ref>Bolton, ''ibid.'' pp. 126-128</ref>  Although no longer a specific liturgical object, some Romans still venerate this icon, considering it a last hope in disasters and memorable events in the capital, a veneration which can be compared with that for the other ancient icon of the ''[[Salus Populi Romani]]'' in [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], again in Rome.  The former icon used to be taken across Rome annually in procession to \"meet\" the latter on the Feast of the Assumption.\n\n===The Veil of Veronica===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Veronica - Vatican2.jpg|190px|thumb|left|The Veronica, kept in the Vatican]] -->\n{{main|Veil of Veronica}}\nVeronica's Veil, known in Italian as the ''Volto Santo'' or Holy Face (but not to be confused with the carved [[crucifix]] [[Holy Face of Lucca|''Volto Santo'' of Lucca]])  is a legendary [[relic]].  The legend is of medieval origin, and only a feature of the [[Western church]]; its connection with any single surviving physical image is slighter still, though a number of images have been associated with it, several probably always meant to be received as copies. The image in the Vatican has a certain priority, if only because of the prestige of the papacy. The nuns of [[San Silvestro in Capite]] in Rome were forbidden to exhibit their rival image in 1517 to avoid competition with the Vatican Veronica; it is also now in the Vatican. Like the Genoa image, it is painted on panel and therefore is likely to have always been intended to be a copy.\n\nThe legend  says that [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] (a name meaning \"true image\") from [[Jerusalem]] encountered Jesus along the [[Via Dolorosa]] on the way to [[Calvary]]. When she paused to wipe the sweat (Latin ''suda'') off his face with her veil, his image was imprinted on the cloth. The event is commemorated by one of the [[Stations of the Cross]]. According to legend, Veronica later traveled to Rome to present the cloth to the Roman Emperor [[Tiberius]].  Legend has it that it has miraculous properties, being able to quench thirst, restore sight, and sometimes even raise the dead.

The image is clearly visible as a photographic negative, as was first observed in 1898 on the reverse photographic plate when amateur photographer [[Secondo Pia]] was unexpectedly allowed to photograph it. The shroud is kept in the royal chapel of the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist (Turin)|Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist]] in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has approved this image in association with the [[Catholic devotion|devotion]] to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] and some believe it is the cloth that covered [[Jesus]] at burial.  The shroud's linen has been [[radiocarbon dating|carbon dated]] and showed a date originating in the late 13th or early 14th century CE.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin|journal=Nature|date=February 1989|first=P.

It is the subject of intense debate among some scientists, believers, historians, and writers regarding where, when, and how the shroud and its images were created.\n\n===Virgin of Guadalupe===\n{{Main|Virgin of Guadalupe}}\nThis full length image of the Virgin is said to have miraculously been created at the unusually late date of 1531 (for the Western church) in Mexico, where it continues to enjoy an enormous reputation.\n\n[[File:1531 Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe anagoria.jpg|thumbnail]]\n\nIn 1929 and 1951 photographers found a figure reflected in the Virgin's eyes; upon inspection they said that the reflection was tripled in what is called the [[Purkinje effect]],{{dubious|reason=perhaps [[Purkinje images]]? - the [[Purkinje effect]] seems to be unrelated|date=February 2017}} commonly found in human eyes.[77]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} An ophthalmologist, Dr. Jose Aste Tonsmann, later enlarged an image of the Virgin's eyes by 2500x and claimed to have found not only the aforementioned single figure, but images of all the witnesses present when the tilma was first revealed before Zum\u00e1rraga in 1531, plus a small family group of mother, father, and a group of children, in the center of the Virgin's eyes, fourteen people in all.\n\nIn 1979 Philip Callahan, (biophysicist, USDA entomologist, NASA consultant) specializing in infrared imaging, was allowed direct access to visually inspect, and photograph, the image. He took numerous infrared photographs of the front of the tilma. Taking notes that were later published, his assistant noted that the original art work was neither cracked nor flaked, while later additions (gold leaf, silver plating the moon) showed serious signs of wear, if not complete deterioration.

He was disheartened with his mission, having made only a few converts. While he was praying by the banks of the [[Ebro]] River with some of his disciples, Mary miraculously appeared before him atop a pillar accompanied by angels. Mary assured James that the people would eventually be converted and their faith would be as strong as the pillar she was standing on. She gave him the pillar as a symbol and a wooden image of herself. James was also instructed to build a chapel on the spot where she left the pillar.\n\nIt is generally believed that Mary would have appeared to James through bilocation, as she was still living either in Ephesus or Jerusalem at the time of this event. She is believed to have died three to fifteen years after Jesus' death. After establishing the church, James returned to Jerusalem with some of his disciples where he became a martyr, beheaded in 44 AD under [[Herod Agrippa]]. His disciples allegedly returned his body to Spain.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Acheiropoietos Monastery]] in Kyrenia, Cyprus\n* [[Apauru\u1e63ey\u0101]]\n* [[Church of the Acheiropoietos]] in Thessaloniki, Greece\n* [[Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena]]\n* [[Swayambhu]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Beckwith, John, ''Early Christian and Byzantine Art'', Penguin History of Art (now Yale), 2nd edn. 1979, {{ISBN|0140560335}}\n*di Lazzaro, P.

Invariably these are images of [[Jesus]] or the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. The most notable examples that are credited by tradition among the faithful are, in the Eastern church the Mandylion,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSX5DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Tradition of the Image of Edessa|last=Guscin|first=Mark|date=2016-02-08|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443888752|location=|pages=137|language=en}}</ref> also known as the [[Image of Edessa]], and the [[Hodegetria]] (depending on the version of their origin stories followed\u2014in many versions both are painted by human painters of Jesus or Mary while alive), and several Russian icons, and in the West the [[Shroud of Turin]], [[Veil of Veronica]], [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], and [[Manoppello Image]].  The term is also used of icons that are only regarded as normal human copies of a miraculously created original archetype.\n\nAlthough the most famous ''acheiropoieta'' today are mostly [[icon]]s in paint on wood panel, they exist with other medium, such as [[mosaic]]s, painted tile, and cloth.  [[Ernst Kitzinger]] distinguished two types: \"Either they are images believed to have been made by hands other than those of ordinary mortals or else they are claimed to be mechanical, though miraculous, impressions of the original\".<ref>Kitzinger, 113</ref>  The belief in such images becomes prominent only in the 6th century, by the end of which both the Mandylion and the Image of [[Camuliana]] were well known.  The pilgrim [[Antoninus of Piacenza (pilgrim)|Antoninus of Piacenza]] was shown a relic of the [[Veil of Veronica]] type in [[Memphis, Egypt]] in the 570s.<ref>Kitzinger, 113-114</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Eternal father painting guadalupe.jpg|thumb|right|[[God the Father]] painting [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], an unusual [[Marian art in the Catholic Church|Marian image]], 18th century.]]\nSuch images functioned as powerful [[relic]]s as well as icons, and their images were naturally seen as especially authoritative as to the true appearance of the subject.  Like other icon types believed to be painted from the live subject, such as the [[Hodegetria]] (thought to have been painted by [[Luke the Evangelist]]), they therefore acted as important references for other images in the tradition.  They therefore were copied on an enormous scale, and the belief that such images existed, and authenticated certain facial types, played an important role in the conservatism of [[iconography|iconographic]] traditions such as the [[Depiction of Jesus]].<ref name=\"Grigg, throughout\">Grigg, throughout</ref>  Beside, and conflated with, the developed legend of the Image of Edessa, was the tale of the Veil of Veronica, whose name was wrongly interpreted in a typical case of [[popular etymology]] to mean \"true icon\" or \"true image\", the fear of a \"false image\" remaining strong.\n\n===Conventional images believed to be authentic===\nA further and larger group of images, sometimes overlapping with acheiropoieta in popular tradition, were believed in the [[Early Middle Ages]] to have been created by conventional means in New Testament times, often by New Testament figures who, like many monks of the later period, were believed to have practiced as artists.  The best known of these, and the most commonly credited in the West, was Saint Luke, who was long believed to have had the Virgin Mary sit for her portrait, but in the East a number of other figures were believed by many to have created images, including narrative ones. [[Saint Peter]] was said to have \"illustrated his own account of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]]\", Luke to have illustrated an entire [[Gospel Book]], and the late 7th century [[Franks|Frankish]] pilgrim [[Arculf]] reported seeing in the [[Holy Land]] a cloth woven or embroidered by the Virgin herself with figures of Jesus and the apostles.  The apostles were also said to have been very active as patrons, commissioning cycles in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[fresco]] in their churches.<ref name=\"Grigg, 5-6, 5 quoted\">Grigg, 5-6, 5 quoted</ref>\n\nSuch beliefs clearly projected contemporary practices back to the 1st century, and in their developed form are not found before the lead-up to the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic Controversy]], but in the 4th century, [[Eusebius]], who disapproved of images, accepted that \"the features of His apostles Peter and Paul, and indeed of Christ himself, have been preserved in coloured portraits which I have examined\".<ref name=\"Grigg, 5-6, 5 quoted\"/>  Many famous images, including the Image of Edessa and Hodegetria, were described in versions of their stories as this type of image.  The belief that images presumably of the 6th century at the earliest were authentic products of the 1st century distorted any sense of stylistic anachronism, making it easier for further images to be accepted, just as the belief in acheiropoieta, which must have reflected a divine standard of realism and accuracy, distorted early medieval perceptions of what degree of realism was possible in art, accounting for the praise very frequently given to images for their realism, when to modern eyes the surviving corpus has little of this.  The standard depictions of both the features of the leading New Testament figures, and the [[iconography]] of key narrative scenes, seemed to have their authenticity confirmed by images believed to have been created either by direct witnesses or those able to hear the accounts of witnesses, or alternatively God himself or his angels.<ref name=\"Grigg, throughout\"/>\n\n==Acheiropoieta of 836==\nSuch icons were seen as powerful arguments against [[iconoclasm]]. In a document{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} apparently produced in the circle of the Patriarch of Constantinople, which purports to be the record of a (fictitious){{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Ecumenical council|Church council]] of 836, a list of ''acheiropoieta'' and icons miraculously protected is given as evidence for divine approval of icons. The ''acheiropoieta'' listed are:\n\n:1. the [[Image of Edessa]], described as still at [[Edessa]];\n:2. the image of the Virgin at [[Lod]], Israel, which was said to have miraculously appeared imprinted on a column of a church built by the apostles Peter and John;\n:3. another image of the Virgin, three [[cubit]]s high, at Lod in Israel, which was said to have miraculously appeared in another church.\n\nThe nine other miracles listed deal with the maintenance rather than creation of icons, which resist or repair the attacks of assorted pagans, Arabs, Persians, scoffers, madmen, iconoclasts and Jews.\n\nThis list seems to have had a regional bias, as other then-famous images are not mentioned, such as the ''Image of Camuliana'',<ref name=\"Mango1986\">{{cite book|last=Mango|first=Cyril A.|title=The Art of the Byzantine Empire 312-1453: Sources and Documents|url=https://archive.org/details/artofbyzantine00mang|url-access=registration|year=1986|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-6627-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/artofbyzantine00mang/page/115 115]\u2013}}</ref> later brought to the capital. Another example, and the only one which indisputably still exists, is a mosaic of the young Christ from the sixth century in the church of Latomos Monastery in [[Thessaloniki]] (now dedicated to Saint David). This was apparently covered by plaster during the Iconoclastic period, towards the end of which an earthquake caused the plaster to fall down, revealing the image (during the reign of Leo V, 813-20). However, this was only a subsidiary miracle, according to the account{{by whom|date=July 2014}} we have. This says that the mosaic was being constructed secretly, during the 4th century persecution of [[Galerius]], as an image of the Virgin, when it suddenly was transformed overnight into the present image of Christ.<ref>Grigg, 6; Cormac</ref>\n\n==Notable examples==\n[[File:Abgarwithimageofedessa10thcentury.jpg|210px|thumb|right|10th century depiction of the legend of King Abgarus]]\n\n{{see also|Holy Face of Jesus}}\n\n===Image of Edessa===\n{{main|Image of Edessa}}\nAccording to Christian legend, the image of Edessa, (known to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] as the ''Mandylion'', a Medieval Greek word not applied in any other context), was a holy relic consisting of a square or rectangle of cloth upon which a miraculous image of the face of Jesus was imprinted &mdash; the first [[icon]] (\"image\"). According to legend, [[Abgar V]] wrote to Jesus, asking him to come cure him of an illness. Abgar received an answering letter from Jesus, declining the invitation, but promising a future visit by one of his disciples. Along with the letter went a likeness of Jesus. This legend was first recorded in the early fourth century by Eusebius,<ref>Eusebius, ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiae]]'' 1.13.5 and .22.</ref> who said that he had transcribed and translated the actual letter in the Syriac chancery documents of the king of Edessa. Instead, [[Thaddeus of Edessa]], one of the [[seventy disciples]], is said to have come to Edessa, bearing the words of Jesus, by the virtues of which the king was miraculously healed.\n\nThe first record of the existence of a physical image in the ancient city of [[Edessa]] (now [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa]]) was in [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], writing about 600, who reports a portrait of Christ, of divine origin (\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), which effected the miraculous aid in the defence of Edessa against the Persians in 544.<ref>Evagrius, in [[Jacques Paul Migne]], ''Patrologia Graeca''lxxxvi, 2, cols. 2748f, noted by Runciman 1931, p. 240, note 5; remarking that \"the portrait of Christ has entered the class of \u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 icons\".</ref> The image was moved to [[Constantinople]] in the 10th century. The cloth disappeared from Constantinople during the [[Fourth Crusade]] [Sack of Constantinople] in 1204, reappearing as a relic in King [[Louis IX of France]]'s [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in [[Paris]].

To art historians, it is a Georgian icon of the 6th-7th century.\n\n===Image of Camuliana===\n{{Main|Camuliana}}\nThough it is now little known, having probably been destroyed in the period of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]],<ref>Beckwith, 88, although Heinrich Pfeiffer identifies it with the [[Veil of Veronica]] and [[Manoppello Image]]:Heinrich Pfeiffer, \"The concept of \"acheiropoietos\", the iconography of the face of Christ and the veil of Manoppello\", in di Lazzaro, [http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/PfeifferWeb.pdf]</ref>)  the icon of Christ from [[Camuliana]] in [[Cappadocia]] was the most famous Greek example, certainly from the time it reached Constantinople in 574, after which it was used as a [[palladium (protective image)|palladium]] in battles by [[Philippicus (general)|Philippikos]], [[Priscus (general)|Priscus]] and [[Heraclius]], and in the [[Pannonian Avars|Pannonian Avar]] [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|Siege of Constantinople in 626]], and praised by [[George Pisida]].<ref>Kitzinger, 111-112; Emerick, 356-357.

Bolton, \"Advertise the Message: Images in Rome at the Turn of the Twelfth Century\", in D. Wood (ed) ''The Church and the Arts'' (Oxford, 1992) p. 117</ref> is kept in what was once the pope's private chapel, in a room now known as the [[Sancta Sanctorum]] at the top of the [[Scala Sancta]] in a surviving part of the old [[Lateran Palace]] in Rome. The legend is that this image was begun by Luke the Evangelist and finished by angels. \n \nIt is thought that the icon was painted in Rome between the 5th and 6th century. Today only slight traces under [[overpainting]] remain of the original image of a [[Christ in Majesty]] with a crossed [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], in the classic pose of the Teacher holding the Scroll of the Law in His left hand while His right is raised in benediction. Many times restored, the face completely changed when [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159\u20131181) had the present one, painted on silk, placed over the original. [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1189\u20131216) covered the rest of the holy icon with an embossed silver [[riza]], but other later embellishments completely covered its surface. It has also been cleaned during the recent restoration. \n[[File:Acheropita lateranense.jpg|thumb|left|The image in its setting in the Pontifical Sanctuary of the [[Holy Stairs]], Rome.]]\n\nThe doors protecting the icon, also in embossed silver, are of the 15th century. It has a [[baldachin]] in metal and gilded wood over it, replacing the one by Caradaossi (1452\u20131527) lost during the sack of Rome in 1527. The image itself was last inspected by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] art historian J. Wilpert in 1907.<ref>Bolton, ''ibid.'' p. 120</ref>\n\nAs early as the reign of [[Pope Sergius I]] (687\u2013701) there are records of the image being carried in annual procession at certain feasts, and [[Pope Stephen II]] (752\u2013757) carried the image on his shoulders in a procession to counter a threat from the [[Lombards]]. By the ninth century its elaborate procession had become a focus of the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]]. In the Middle Ages the Pope and the seven [[Cardinal (Roman Catholic)|cardinal-bishops]] would celebrate masses in the small sanctuary where it was housed, and at times would kiss its feet.<ref>Bolton, ''ibid.'' pp. 126-128</ref>  Although no longer a specific liturgical object, some Romans still venerate this icon, considering it a last hope in disasters and memorable events in the capital, a veneration which can be compared with that for the other ancient icon of the ''[[Salus Populi Romani]]'' in [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], again in Rome.  The former icon used to be taken across Rome annually in procession to \"meet\" the latter on the Feast of the Assumption.\n\n===The Veil of Veronica===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Veronica - Vatican2.jpg|190px|thumb|left|The Veronica, kept in the Vatican]] -->\n{{main|Veil of Veronica}}\nVeronica's Veil, known in Italian as the ''Volto Santo'' or Holy Face (but not to be confused with the carved [[crucifix]] [[Holy Face of Lucca|''Volto Santo'' of Lucca]])  is a legendary [[relic]].  The legend is of medieval origin, and only a feature of the [[Western church]]; its connection with any single surviving physical image is slighter still, though a number of images have been associated with it, several probably always meant to be received as copies. The image in the Vatican has a certain priority, if only because of the prestige of the papacy. The nuns of [[San Silvestro in Capite]] in Rome were forbidden to exhibit their rival image in 1517 to avoid competition with the Vatican Veronica; it is also now in the Vatican. Like the Genoa image, it is painted on panel and therefore is likely to have always been intended to be a copy.\n\nThe legend  says that [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] (a name meaning \"true image\") from [[Jerusalem]] encountered Jesus along the [[Via Dolorosa]] on the way to [[Calvary]]. When she paused to wipe the sweat (Latin ''suda'') off his face with her veil, his image was imprinted on the cloth. The event is commemorated by one of the [[Stations of the Cross]]. According to legend, Veronica later traveled to Rome to present the cloth to the Roman Emperor [[Tiberius]].  Legend has it that it has miraculous properties, being able to quench thirst, restore sight, and sometimes even raise the dead.

The shroud is kept in the royal chapel of the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist (Turin)|Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist]] in [[Turin]], [[Italy]].

It is the subject of intense debate among some scientists, believers, historians, and writers regarding where, when, and how the shroud and its images were created.\n\n===Virgin of Guadalupe===\n{{Main|Virgin of Guadalupe}}\nThis full length image of the Virgin is said to have miraculously been created at the unusually late date of 1531 (for the Western church) in Mexico, where it continues to enjoy an enormous reputation.\n\n[[File:1531 Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe anagoria.jpg|thumbnail]]\n\nIn 1929 and 1951 photographers found a figure reflected in the Virgin's eyes; upon inspection they said that the reflection was tripled in what is called the [[Purkinje effect]],{{dubious|reason=perhaps [[Purkinje images]]? - the [[Purkinje effect]] seems to be unrelated|date=February 2017}} commonly found in human eyes.[77]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} An ophthalmologist, Dr. Jose Aste Tonsmann, later enlarged an image of the Virgin's eyes by 2500x and claimed to have found not only the aforementioned single figure, but images of all the witnesses present when the tilma was first revealed before Zum\u00e1rraga in 1531, plus a small family group of mother, father, and a group of children, in the center of the Virgin's eyes, fourteen people in all.\n\nIn 1979 Philip Callahan, (biophysicist, USDA entomologist, NASA consultant) specializing in infrared imaging, was allowed direct access to visually inspect, and photograph, the image. He took numerous infrared photographs of the front of the tilma. Taking notes that were later published, his assistant noted that the original art work was neither cracked nor flaked, while later additions (gold leaf, silver plating the moon) showed serious signs of wear, if not complete deterioration. Callahan could not explain the excellent state of preservation of the un-retouched areas of the image on the tilma, particularly the upper two-thirds of the image. His findings, with photographs, were published in 1981.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Lord of Miracles of Buga===\n{{Main|Lord of Miracles of Buga}}\n\nThis is a tridimensional image of Jesus Christ crucified that comes from the 16th century, and it is attributed to a miraculous event occurred to an Amerindian woman of this South American Andean region, who worked washing clothes for wealthy families of the city of Buga.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n[[File: Buga2.png|thumbnail]]\n\nOn October 5, 2006, a team of specialists, using four different complementary technologies: X rays,  ultraviolet rays, pigment and stratigraphic analysis of the image, certified its incredibly well preserved condition.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nOfficial celebration in the religious Catholic calendar: September 14.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Our Lady of The Pillar ===\n{{Main|Our Lady of the Pillar}}\n[[File:El ap\u00f3stol Santiago y sus disc\u00edpulos adorando a la Virgen del Pilar.jpg|thumbnail]]\nAccording to ancient Spanish tradition in the early days of Christianity, [[James the Great]], one of the original Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ, was preaching the Gospel in what was then the pagan land of [[Caesaraugusta]] (now Zaragoza), in the Roman province of [[Hispania]]. He was disheartened with his mission, having made only a few converts. While he was praying by the banks of the [[Ebro]] River with some of his disciples, Mary miraculously appeared before him atop a pillar accompanied by angels. Mary assured James that the people would eventually be converted and their faith would be as strong as the pillar she was standing on. She gave him the pillar as a symbol and a wooden image of herself. James was also instructed to build a chapel on the spot where she left the pillar.\n\nIt is generally believed that Mary would have appeared to James through bilocation, as she was still living either in Ephesus or Jerusalem at the time of this event. She is believed to have died three to fifteen years after Jesus' death. After establishing the church, James returned to Jerusalem with some of his disciples where he became a martyr, beheaded in 44 AD under [[Herod Agrippa]]. His disciples allegedly returned his body to Spain.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Acheiropoietos Monastery]] in Kyrenia, Cyprus\n* [[Apauru\u1e63hey\u0101]]\n* [[Church of the Acheiropoietos]] in Thessaloniki, Greece\n* [[Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena]]\n* [[Swayambhu]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Beckwith, John, ''Early Christian and Byzantine Art'', Penguin History of Art (now Yale), 2nd edn. 1979, {{ISBN|0140560335}}\n*di Lazzaro, P.
