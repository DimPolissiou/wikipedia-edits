Dot tells Jack that Charlie is going to take Matthew back to Ireland and Charlie and Jack argue about it, with Jack later telling Charlie that he swore on Ronnie's grave to never leave Amy, Ricky and Matthew. When Charlie provokes Jack by saying Ronnie deserved to die, Jack punches him and Max tells Jack he may have lost his chances of keeping Matthew. Max learns that Jack still may get to keep Matthew despite the fight with Jack, so Max visits Charlie and beats him up to make it look like Jack did it. In April 2017, Jack is arrested and charged with assault. Dot attempts to mediate between Charlie and Jack, but they fail to come up with any solution and Jack plans to go on the run with Amy, Ricky and Matthew, but Dot tells Max and they talk him out of it.

[[Stacey Fowler]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) tells Jack he has to work things out with Charlie. Charlie's wife, [[Liz Cotton]] (Michelle Connolly) arrives in Albert Square in place of Charlie and tells Jack about her job and family, trying to assure him that Matthew would have a good life and that Amy and Ricky would be welcome to visit.

He appears to be fine, despite Mick insisting they should take him to hospital. Linda later finds Ollie is not breathing, but successfully resuscitates him.

After a heist involving Mick, he is suspected of stealing the money and [[Aidan Maguire]] ([[Patrick Bergin]]) frightens Linda when he lets himself into The Queen Vic when he has hold of Ollie.

She gets on well with her father, [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]), and they go for a drink together, where Masood tells Carmel that Shabnam has a daughter that she abandoned seven years ago. Carmel is understanding and offers her support to Shabnam but this just angers Shabnam as it wasn't his place to tell anyone. Carmel visits frequently and Shabnam dislikes her interference with planning the wedding. She is delighted when Shabnam and Kush announce they are expecting. Carmel visits unannounced, distraught that Kush's father is selling her house and Shabnam begrudgingly allows her to stay with them but catches her in bed with Masood. After Kush learns that the baby is dead, Masood contacts Carmel and allows her to stay with him. Before returning to Essex, she and Masood help Kush and Shabnam reconcile for their stillborn son, [[Shabnam Masood#Stillbirth|Zaair]]'s, funeral. Carmel returns in November for the wedding and before they leave for their honeymoon, she promises to run Kush's stall in his absence. She also befriends [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]).\n\nShortly after Kush and Shabnam return, Carmel sees Kush and a pregnant [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) whispering and, after talking to Stacey, she realizes that Kush could be the baby's father. She confronts them but they persuade her not to tell Shabnam or [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]), insisting it is not the right time. Carmel agrees, but warns Stacey that Kush may want access to the baby if it is his.\n\nCarmel returns to the square in the spring, saying that her former husband, [[Umar Kazemi]] ([[Selva Rasalingam]]), is selling her house after all and that she has nowhere to live, so Kush allows her to move in with him and is joined by her youngest son, [[Shakil Kazemi|Shakil]] ([[Shaheen Jafargholi]]) a few weeks later. Shakil tells her that Umar wants to meet to discuss a possible reunion but it turns out that Shakil was lying, making Carmel feel unwanted but she and Shakil soon make up. Carmel is encouraged to apply for the job of market Inspector by Denise, and is overjoyed when she gets the job. She gets on the traders' nerves initially but soon learns to work with them. Carmel begins sleeping with Masood and she hopes that it will lead to a relationship but Masood leaves to travel the world, leaving Carmel devastated. She is later shocked to discover Denise is pregnant, telling her to book a scan and pressures her to tell her who the father is, infuriating Denise as the baby's father is [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). When she feels her flat is too crowded, she decides to rent No. 31 after [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) leaves the square. However, Martin opposes her as he wants the house for his family, so Carmel retracts her deposit and decides to rent No. 41, Masood's house instead. Whilst moving in, Masood returns unexpectedly, forcing them to share the house as she has already signed the contract. When [[Belinda Peacock]] ([[Carli Norris]]) begins a relationship with Masood, she doubts her motives and accuses her of only being with Masood for financial purposes, to save her debt ridden salon, \"Elysium\". However, Belinda leaves the square soon after. Carmel and Denise are later furious to discover that Masood is planning to move to Pakistan and accuses him of leaving to reunite with his former wife [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]). They all reconciled before Masood leaves, telling him they'll always be there for him, and watch him leave. Carmel tries to talk Denise out of her decision to give her newborn son up for adoption, but eventually decides to support her, not wanting to end their friendship. Carmel tries to reason with market traders when they hear that the market be relocated. During the dispute, a bus crashes into the market and the viaduct. Carmel survives the crash and worries over Shakil's welfare when she learns he is on board, but is later relieved when he jumps off the top deck safely with the help of the others at the bottom.\n\nCarmel is shocked to discover that naked photos of Shakil have been sent around the school, and is angry to discover it was allegedly Shakil's former girlfriend, [[Bex Fowler]] ([[Jasmine Armfield]]) who sent them, although it was really [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]). Due to the tension between the Kazemis and the Fowlers, Martin and Stacey decide that Carmel should keep her distance from her grandson, which Carmel reacts badly to, and in the argument, she and Stacey physically fight after Carmel made a comment on Stacey's mental health.<ref name=\"9mar17pt2\"/> In April 2017, she becomes close to [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]), after he helps her make amends with Stacey, and also helps her with an interview for the Walford Council planning committee. Although she remains oblivious to Max's scheming. When Masood returns from travelling, he informs Carmel that he is not going to renew her tenancy contract. Although disappointed, Carmel asks Max whether they should find a home of their own, which slightly displeases him. Carmel is then delighted that the council has dropped the investigation and decides to make her a full-time employee. Shortly after having sex with Max, Carmel finds an engagement ring while tidying up the house and mistakenly believes Max wants to propose to her, when in fact it is intended for his secret girlfriend [[Fi Browning]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]). The following day Carmel still believes Max is going to propose to her and prepares to celebrate with him at The Queen Vic. However, when he walks into The Vic, he deliberately ignores her and kisses Fi, humiliating Carmel in front of everyone and finally revealing his scheme. Realising she has been used, Carmel upsettingly storms out of the pub. Carmel and Shakil then moves in with Kush and Denise. While Carmel is at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] for [[Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle|the wedding]] of [[Prince Harry]] and [[Meghan Markle]], Shakil is stabbed in the back by a gang and the delay in finding him proves fatal. She rushes to the hospital to be told her son is dead. After hearing that Kush may still leave for Dubai, she feels helpless and tries to commit suicide but she is then strengthened by the discovery of Shakil's watch. She attends Shakil's memorial in the Square's gardens and makes amends with [[Karen Taylor (EastEnders)|Karen Taylor]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]). Shaki's best mate, [[Keegan Baker]] ([[Zack Morris]]) takes her to where Shaki's killer, [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Bruno|Bruno]], lives and offers to square things but Carmel warns him against and they have the police arrest Bruno; outside the police station, Carmel reveals herself to his mother, [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Sophie|Sophie]] ([[Melanie Harris]]). When Carmel finds Keegan in possession of a knife, she anonymously hands it in and decides to campaign for a knife amnesty, where young people can hand in knives to a public knife bin and their identities remain secret. She then tries to start a youth club but fails. At Halloween, Keegan stabs a boy who disrespected Shakil and Carmel allows him to think that the boy died, Carmel and Karen have a heated row leading to Keegan finally being made to see sense. Carmel and Keegan make amends before she moves abroad.\n\nLangford was nominated for the \"Best Newcomer\" award at [[Inside Soap Awards#2015|The Inside Soap Awards 2015]] for her portrayal of Carmel.<ref name=InsideSoapLonglist>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a658118/inside-soap-awards-2015-longlist-revealed-whos-in-line-for-best-actor-actress-and-newcomer.html#~pmHi8CWFSFhM6F|title=Inside Soap Awards 2015 longlist revealed: Who's in line for Best Actor, Actress and Newcomer?|work=Digital Spy|date=14 July 2015}}</ref> She also won the \"Best Newcomer\" award at [[The British Soap Awards]] in 2016 for her portrayal of Carmel.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/05/28/british-soap-awards-2016-emmerdale-wins-best-soap-for-the-first/|title=British Soap Awards 2016: Emmerdale wins Best Soap for the first time, Danny Miller and Lacey Turner win in acting categories \u2013 plus full list of winners|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=28 May 2016|last1=McAloon|first1=Jonathan}}</ref> In September 2016, Laura-Jane Tyler of ''Inside Soap'' described Carmel as the \"life and soul of Walford\" amid a time for the show when it was \"on a low gas\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Hits & Misses!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=24\u201330 September 2016|issue=38|pages=98|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines International]]}}</ref> In July 2018, Langford was longlisted for the \"Best Actress\" accolade at [[Inside Soap Awards|The Inside Soap Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a862268/inside-soap-awards-2018-full-longlist-coronation-street-eastenders-emmerdale-hollyoaks/|title=Full list of nominations for the Inside Soap Awards 2018|last=Davies|first=Megan|date=24 July 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=26 July 2018}}</ref> She progressed to the viewer-voted shortlist in October 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a868513/coronation-street-inside-soap-awards-shortlist-2018/ |title=Inside Soap Awards 2018: Coronation Street tops the shortlist with 18 nominations |last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Paul Coker==\n{{Main|Paul Coker (EastEnders)}}\n'''Paul Coker''', played by [[Jonny Labey]], made his first screen appearance on 1 June 2015.

Stacey worries that Arthur could die and tells Bex about the possibility of Arthur having the syndrome. A doctor assures Stacey that the chance of Arthur displaying symptoms at a young age is small. Arthur undergoes an ECG and Stacey, Kush and Martin are told by the specialist that Arthur is at high risk at having the condition, but cannot have an operation or tests like Kush due to his age. Stacey is anxious that Arthur having a cardiac arrest is a sign of the condition and his parents are told about equipment that is not available on the NHS. Stacey is angry with Martin that he asked Kush for money to buy the equipment. Stacey and Martin panic when Arthur will not wake up, and when they receive Arthur's medical records at the hospital, Stacey and Martin are told that Arthur has swallowed Stacey's bipolar medication. Carmel is horrified when she finds bruises on Arthur's arms, and expresses her concerns to Kush that Stacey is unwell, while Stacey tells [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Jenna Russell]]) that he gained the bruises in hospital. However, Lily tells Carmel that Stacey was responsible, so Carmel reports it to social services, but tries to retract what she said after realising it was a mistake. Social services visit Stacey and Martin and tell them they received a report about Arthur. Arthur and Lily are placed in Carmel's care until social services have investigated. Arthur is looked over by a doctor, who has no concerns and Stacey and Martin can have Arthur and Lily back.

Martin keeps the children inside, away from Stacey, though the pair support each other briefly when Lily holds Hope by the upstairs window, asking for Stacey. Martin rejects Stacey when she says the children need her and he decides he will not let Stacey near the children. Martin decides to go for custody and when Kush and Carmel find out, Carmel wants Kush to get custody of Arthur, but Kush attempts to get them to resolve their problems. Martin sees Stacey, offering her contact, but Stacey contacts Lily's father, [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]), to help her and a locksmith changes the locks, devastating Martin. An unknown relative of Arthur's, [[Hayley Slater]] ([[Katie Jarvis]]), distracts Martin when he is looking after Hope and after finding out who she is, Stacey contacts Hayley again and when Martin is looking after Hope and Arthur, Hayley encourages Martin to take the children to a stay and play, buy them some tea and eat ice cream, disobeying Stacey's instructions.

Later that night, while he and his wife, [[Pam Coker]] ([[Lin Blakley]]), are celebrating their wedding anniversary, Les gets a text from Claudette, thanking him for her necklace. Claudette and Les meet again a week later at the park, with Claudette later arriving for her foster daughter [[Donna Yates]]' ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]) birthday celebrations as arranged by Pam. It's revealed that she knows Les and Pam from when the latter worked as a social worker and placed Donna in Claudette's care. Weeks later, it's revealed that both Claudette and Les are in [[Gran Canaria]] on business. Donna ironically suggests that the two should meet up. Claudette reappears when her son [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) introduces her to her new granddaughter [[#Pearl Fox-Hubbard|Pearl]], and his wife [[Kim Fox-Hubbard]] ([[Tameka Empson]]). Claudette is angry that she had to wait so long to meet Pearl. She is hostile towards Kim, her sister [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and their family friend [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]), as she believes that they have stolen Vincent from her. When Les' grandson, [[Paul Coker (EastEnders)|Paul Coker]] ([[Jonny Labey]]), arrives in Walford, he reveals that he knows Les and Claudette are having an affair.

Les attempts to dissuade Claudette from coming to the Coker and Sons centenary party but she goes anyway and tells Les that Vincent is aware of their meetings. Meanwhile, at home, Paul tells Pam about the affair. Claudette later realises that Pam knows while seeing her freak out at her face with her and Les in the newspaper photo. She makes plans to have dinner with Les, declining Pam's invitation to dinner on the way there. When Pam notes how Claudette used exactly the same words as Les did, Claudette sends Les home.

The next day, she helps Pam and Les prepare for their \"meeting\" with Christine, and tells Pam that \"seeing\" Christine for the first time will be easier than she thinks.

She moves in with Vincent, Kim and Pearl when he buys a large house on Albert Square.\n\nClaudette starts working in The Albert and meets Phil's aunt, [[Aunt Sal|Sal]] ([[Anna Karen]]), who is visiting the Mitchells. Sal reveals that Claudette used to work at a bar nearby and has known the Mitchell family for decades.

It is revealed that Claudette's husband, Henry, was an associate of [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]), [[Ted Hills]] ([[Brian Croucher]]), [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]) and Eric Mitchell, Phil's father. Vincent was told by Claudette that Henry was killed by Eric 34 years previously on Christmas Eve after a confrontation when Vincent was a child. A drunken Phil kidnaps Pearl which leads to an altercation between Vincent and Phil. Vincent says that Eric killed his father but Phil says Henry just left Walford.

She gets on well with her father, [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]), and they go for a drink together, where Masood tells Carmel that Shabnam has a daughter that she abandoned seven years ago. Carmel is understanding and offers her support to Shabnam but this just angers Shabnam as it wasn't his place to tell anyone. Carmel visits frequently and Shabnam dislikes her interference with planning the wedding. She is delighted when Shabnam and Kush announce they are expecting. Carmel visits unannounced, distraught that Kush's father is selling her house and Shabnam begrudgingly allows her to stay with them but catches her in bed with Masood. After Kush learns that the baby is dead, Masood contacts Carmel and allows her to stay with him. Before returning to Essex, she and Masood help Kush and Shabnam reconcile for their stillborn son, [[Shabnam Masood#Stillbirth|Zaair]]'s, funeral. Carmel returns in November for the wedding and before they leave for their honeymoon, she promises to run Kush's stall in his absence. She also befriends [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]).\n\nShortly after Kush and Shabnam return, Carmel sees Kush and a pregnant [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) whispering and, after talking to Stacey, she realizes that Kush could be the baby's father. She confronts them but they persuade her not to tell Shabnam or [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]), insisting it is not the right time. Carmel agrees, but warns Stacey that Kush may want access to the baby if it is his.\n\nCarmel returns to the square in the spring, saying that her former husband, [[Umar Kazemi]] ([[Selva Rasalingam]]), is selling her house after all and that she has nowhere to live, so Kush allows her to move in with him and is joined by her youngest son, [[Shakil Kazemi|Shakil]] ([[Shaheen Jafargholi]]) a few weeks later. Shakil tells her that Umar wants to meet to discuss a possible reunion but it turns out that Shakil was lying, making Carmel feel unwanted but she and Shakil soon make up. Carmel is encouraged to apply for the job of market Inspector by Denise, and is overjoyed when she gets the job. She gets on the traders' nerves initially but soon learns to work with them. Carmel begins sleeping with Masood and she hopes that it will lead to a relationship but Masood leaves to travel the world, leaving Carmel devastated. She is later shocked to discover Denise is pregnant, telling her to book a scan and pressures her to tell her who the father is, infuriating Denise as the baby's father is [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). When she feels her flat is too crowded, she decides to rent No. 31 after [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) leaves the square. However, Martin opposes her as he wants the house for his family, so Carmel retracts her deposit and decides to rent No. 41, Masood's house instead. Whilst moving in, Masood returns unexpectedly, forcing them to share the house as she has already signed the contract. When [[Belinda Peacock]] ([[Carli Norris]]) begins a relationship with Masood, she doubts her motives and accuses her of only being with Masood for financial purposes, to save her debt ridden salon, \"Elysium\". However, Belinda leaves the square soon after. Carmel and Denise are later furious to discover that Masood is planning to move to Pakistan and accuses him of leaving to reunite with his former wife [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]). They all reconciled before Masood leaves, telling him they'll always be there for him, and watch him leave. Carmel tries to talk Denise out of her decision to give her newborn son up for adoption, but eventually decides to support her, not wanting to end their friendship. Carmel tries to reason with market traders when they hear that the market be relocated. During the dispute, a bus crashes into the market and the viaduct. Carmel survives the crash and worries over Shakil's welfare when she learns he is on board, but is later relieved when he jumps off the top deck safely with the help of the others at the bottom.\n\nCarmel is shocked to discover that naked photos of Shakil have been sent around the school, and is angry to discover it was allegedly Shakil's former girlfriend, [[Bex Fowler]] ([[Jasmine Armfield]]) who sent them, although it was really [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]). Due to the tension between the Kazemis and the Fowlers, Martin and Stacey decide that Carmel should keep her distance from her grandson, which Carmel reacts badly to, and in the argument, she and Stacey physically fight after Carmel made a comment on Stacey's mental health.<ref name=\"9mar17pt2\"/> In April 2017, she becomes close to [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]), after he helps her make amends with Stacey, and also helps her with an interview for the Walford Council planning committee. Although she remains oblivious to Max's scheming. When Masood returns from travelling, he informs Carmel that he is not going to renew her tenancy contract. Although disappointed, Carmel asks Max whether they should find a home of their own, which slightly displeases him. Carmel is then delighted that the council has dropped the investigation and decides to make her a full-time employee. Shortly after having sex with Max, Carmel finds an engagement ring while tidying up the house and mistakenly believes Max wants to propose to her, when in fact it is intended for his secret girlfriend [[Fi Browning]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]). The following day Carmel still believes Max is going to propose to her and prepares to celebrate with him at The Queen Vic. However, when he walks into The Vic, he deliberately ignores her and kisses Fi, humiliating Carmel in front of everyone and finally revealing his scheme. Realising she has been used, Carmel upsettingly storms out of the pub. Carmel and Shakil then moves in with Kush and Denise. While Carmel is at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] for [[Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle|the wedding]] of [[Prince Harry]] and [[Meghan Markle]], Shakil is stabbed in the back by a gang and the delay in finding him proves fatal. She rushes to the hospital to be told her son is dead. After hearing that Kush may still leave for Dubai, she feels helpless and tries to commit suicide but she is then strengthened by the discovery of Shakil's watch. She attends Shakil's memorial in the Square's gardens and makes amends with [[Karen Taylor (EastEnders)|Karen Taylor]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]). Shaki's best mate, [[Keegan Baker]] ([[Zack Morris]]) takes her to where Shaki's killer, [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Bruno|Bruno]], lives and offers to square things but Carmel warns him against and they have the police arrest Bruno; outside the police station, Carmel reveals herself to his mother, [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Sophie|Sophie]] ([[Melanie Harris]]). When Carmel finds Keegan in possession of a knife, she anonymously hands it in and decides to campaign for a knife amnesty, where young people can hand in knives to a public knife bin and their identities remain secret. She then tries to start a youth club but fails. At Halloween, Keegan stabs a boy who disrespected Shakil and Carmel allows him to think that the boy died, Carmel and Karen have a heated row leading to Keegan finally being made to see sense. Carmel and Keegan make amends before she moves abroad.\n\nLangford was nominated for the \"Best Newcomer\" award at [[Inside Soap Awards#2015|The Inside Soap Awards 2015]] for her portrayal of Carmel.<ref name=InsideSoapLonglist>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a658118/inside-soap-awards-2015-longlist-revealed-whos-in-line-for-best-actor-actress-and-newcomer.html#~pmHi8CWFSFhM6F|title=Inside Soap Awards 2015 longlist revealed: Who's in line for Best Actor, Actress and Newcomer?|work=Digital Spy|date=14 July 2015}}</ref> She also won the \"Best Newcomer\" award at [[The British Soap Awards]] in 2016 for her portrayal of Carmel.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/05/28/british-soap-awards-2016-emmerdale-wins-best-soap-for-the-first/|title=British Soap Awards 2016: Emmerdale wins Best Soap for the first time, Danny Miller and Lacey Turner win in acting categories \u2013 plus full list of winners|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=28 May 2016|last1=McAloon|first1=Jonathan}}</ref> In September 2016, Laura-Jane Tyler of ''Inside Soap'' described Carmel as the \"life and soul of Walford\" amid a time for the show when it was \"on a low gas\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Hits & Misses!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=24\u201330 September 2016|issue=38|pages=98|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines International]]}}</ref> In July 2018, Langford was longlisted for the \"Best Actress\" accolade at [[Inside Soap Awards|The Inside Soap Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a862268/inside-soap-awards-2018-full-longlist-coronation-street-eastenders-emmerdale-hollyoaks/|title=Full list of nominations for the Inside Soap Awards 2018|last=Davies|first=Megan|date=24 July 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=26 July 2018}}</ref> She progressed to the viewer-voted shortlist in October 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a868513/coronation-street-inside-soap-awards-shortlist-2018/ |title=Inside Soap Awards 2018: Coronation Street tops the shortlist with 18 nominations |last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Paul Coker==\n{{Main|Paul Coker (EastEnders)}}\n'''Paul Coker''', played by [[Jonny Labey]], made his first screen appearance on 1 June 2015.

Stacey is anxious that Arthur having a cardiac arrest is a sign of the condition and his parents are told about equipment that is not available on the NHS. Stacey is angry with Martin that he asked Kush for money to buy the equipment. Stacey and Martin panic when Arthur will not wake up, and when they receive Arthur's medical records at the hospital, Stacey and Martin are told that Arthur has swallowed Stacey's bipolar medication. Carmel is horrified when she finds bruises on Arthur's arms, and expresses her concerns to Kush that Stacey is unwell, while Stacey tells [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Jenna Russell]]) that he gained the bruises in hospital. However, Lily tells Carmel that Stacey was responsible, so Carmel reports it to social services, but tries to retract what she said after realising it was a mistake. Social services visit Stacey and Martin and tell them they received a report about Arthur. Arthur and Lily are placed in Carmel's care until social services have investigated. Arthur is looked over by a doctor, who has no concerns and Stacey and Martin can have Arthur and Lily back. Social worker [[List of EastEnders characters (2014)#Fiona Payne|Fiona Payne]] (Sandra James-Young) tells Stacey and Martin she will be conducting further home visits.\n\nAfter Stacey cheats on Martin with Max, Stacey leaves Walford with Arthur, Lily and his half-sister, [[Hope Fowler]]. Stacey returns a few weeks later and when Stacey is out, Martin accuses her of being with Max, so Stacey decides Martin should leave; he is hurt Stacey does not regard Arthur and Lily as his children, but he angrily throws her out and exposes her affair. Martin keeps the children inside, away from Stacey, though the pair support each other briefly when Lily holds Hope by the upstairs window, asking for Stacey. Martin rejects Stacey when she says the children need her and he decides he will not let Stacey near the children. Martin decides to go for custody and when Kush and Carmel find out, Carmel wants Kush to get custody of Arthur, but Kush attempts to get them to resolve their problems. Martin sees Stacey, offering her contact, but Stacey contacts Lily's father, [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]), to help her and a locksmith changes the locks, devastating Martin. An unknown relative of Arthur's, [[Hayley Slater]] ([[Katie Jarvis]]), distracts Martin when he is looking after Hope and after finding out who she is, Stacey contacts Hayley again and when Martin is looking after Hope and Arthur, Hayley encourages Martin to take the children to a stay and play, buy them some tea and eat ice cream, disobeying Stacey's instructions. Hayley pretends to defend Martin in front of Stacey when she collects Arthur and Hope with police presence due to Martin not returning them.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Others==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" | Date(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Actor\n! scope=\"col\" | Circumstances\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|Dr Margaret Badini}}{{Anchor|Margaret Badini}}\n| {{nowrap|1 January \u2013 24 April<br/>(12 episodes)}}\n| [[Kim Vithana]]<ref name=\"1jan15\">{{cite episode|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04wty53|title=Episode dated 01/01/2015|series=EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders|credits=Writer: James Payne; Director: Lance Kneeshaw; Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC One]]|airdate=1 January 2015}}</ref>\n| A doctor who treats [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) after she is injured in a car accident.

Beijing's strongest supporters were in Asia, in [[Malaysia]] (81%) and [[Pakistan]] (81%); African nations of [[Kenya]] (78%), [[Senegal]] (77%) and [[Nigeria]] (76%); as well as Latin America, particularly in countries dependent on the Chinese market, such as [[Venezuela]] (71%), [[Brazil]] (65%) and [[Chile]] (62%).<ref name=pewglobal>[http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/07/18/chapter-3-attitudes-toward-china/ Chapter 3.

But in just 11 of the 38 nations surveyed was China actually viewed unfavorably by at least half of those surveyed. Japan was polled to have the most anti-China sentiment, where 93% see the People's Republic in a negative light, including 48% of Japanese who have a very unfavorable view of China. There were also majorities in Germany (64%), Italy (62%) and Israel (60%) who held negative views of China. The rise in anti-China sentiment in Germany was particularly striking:  from 33% disfavor in 2006 to 64% under the 2013 survey, with such views existing despite Germany's success exporting to China.<ref name=pewglobal />\n\nDespite China's general appeal to the young, half or more of those people surveyed in 26 of 38 nations felt that China acted unilaterally in international affairs, notably increasing tensions between China and other neighboring countries, excluding Russia, over territorial disputes. This concern about Beijing's failure to consider other countries' interests when making foreign policy decisions was particularly strong in the Asia-Pacific \u2013 in Japan (89%), South Korea (79%) and Australia (79%) \u2013 and in Europe \u2013 in Spain (85%), Italy (83%), France (83%) and Britain (82%). About half or more of those in the seven Middle Eastern nations surveyed also thought China acted unilaterally. This includes 79% of Israelis, 71% of Jordanians and 68% of Turks. There was relatively less concern about this issue in the U.S. (60%). African nations \u2013 in particular strong majorities in Kenya (77%), Nigeria (70%), South Africa (67%) and Senegal (62%) \u2013 believed Beijing considered their interests when making foreign policy decisions.<ref name=pewglobal /> When asked in 2013 whether China had the respect it should have, 56% of Chinese respondents felt China should have been more respected.<ref name=pewglobal />\n\n==History==\nWhile historical conflicts had stemmed anti-Chinese sentiment since antiquity, modern and organized anti-Chinese sentiment both date back to the 19th century.<ref name=\"Chinese Exclusion Act\">{{Cite book | url=https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=47 | title=Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)| isbn=978146831339| last1=Government| first1=US| date=2019-03-10}}</ref>{{not in citation|date=January 2020}} At the time of the [[British Empire]]'s [[First Opium War]] (1839-1842) against [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]], [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] regarded the Chinese as uncivilized and suggested that the British must attack China to show up their superiority as well as to demonstrate what a \"civilized\" nation could do.<ref name=\"Lovell Julia\">{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=SMZTCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA56-IA14&lpg=PA56-IA14&dq=british+sinophobia+opium+war#v=onepage&q=british%20sinophobia%20opium%20war&f=false | title=The Opium War: Drugs, Dreams, and the Making of Modern China| isbn=9781468313239| last1=Lovell| first1=Julia| date=2015-11-10}}</ref> The trend became commonly popular throughout the [[Second Opium War]] (1856-1860), when repeated attacks against foreign traders in China inflamed anti-Chinese campaigns.<ref name=\"Chinese Exclusion Act\" />{{not in citation|date=January 2020}} With the defeat of China in both wars, and violent behavior of Chinese towards foreigners, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] upon his arrival in [[Beijing|Peking]] in 1860 ordered the looting and burning of China's [[Old Summer Palace|Summer Palace]] in vengeance, highlighting the deep Sinophobic sentiment existing in the West.<ref>[https://www.historytoday.com/ewr-lumby/lord-elgin-and-burning-summer-palace Lord Elgin and the Burning of the Summer Palace].

After the [[Nagasaki incident|violence]] in [[Nagasaki]] caused by Chinese sailors, it stemmed anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan and following Qing China's non-apology, it even strained further. After the end of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Japan defeated China and soon acquired colonial possessions of [[Taiwan]] and [[Ryukyu Islands]].\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Sinophobia was still common in Europe, notably in Britain. Chinese men had been a fixture on [[London]]'s docks since the mid-eighteenth century, when they arrived as sailors who were employed by the East India Company, importing tea and spices from the Far East. Conditions on those long voyages were so dreadful that many sailors decided to abscond and take their chances on the streets rather than face the return journey. Those who stayed generally settled around the bustling docks, running laundries and small lodging houses for other sailors or selling exotic Asian produce. By the 1880s, a small but recognizable Chinese community had developed in the Limehouse area, to the consternation of white native-born Londoners, who feared [[Miscegenation|racial mixing]] and an influx of cheap labor. The entire Chinese population of London was only in the low hundreds\u2014in a city whose entire population was roughly estimated to be seven million\u2014but [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] feelings ran high, as was evidenced by the Aliens Act of 1905, a bundle of legislation which sought to restrict entry to poor and low-skilled foreign workers.<ref name=theparisreview>[https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/05/unspeakable-affections/ Unspeakable Affections] - Paris Review.

The Spaniards quelled the rebellion and massacred around 20,000 Chinese. The Chinese responded by fleeing to the [[Sulu Sultanate]] and supporting the Moro Muslims in their war against the Spanish.

However, they were denied by law the rights of citizenship, including the right to vote, and in the 1880s, \"[[tax per head|head taxes]]\" were implemented to curtail immigration from China.

The Exclusion Act was repealed in 1947, the same year in which [[Chinese Canadian]]s were given the right to vote.

Japan was polled to have the most anti-China sentiment, where 93% see the People's Republic in a negative light, including 48% of Japanese who have a very unfavorable view of China. There were also majorities in Germany (64%), Italy (62%) and Israel (60%) who held negative views of China.

After the [[Nagasaki incident|violence]] in [[Nagasaki]] caused by Chinese sailors, it stemmed anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan and following Qing China's non-apology, it even strained further. After the end of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Japan defeated China and soon acquired colonial possessions of [[Taiwan]] and [[Ryukyu Islands]].\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Sinophobia was still common in Europe, notably in Britain. Chinese men had been a fixture on [[London]]'s docks since the mid-eighteenth century, when they arrived as sailors who were employed by the East India Company, importing tea and spices from the Far East. Conditions on those long voyages were so dreadful that many sailors decided to abscond and take their chances on the streets rather than face the return journey. Those who stayed generally settled around the bustling docks, running laundries and small lodging houses for other sailors or selling exotic Asian produce. By the 1880s, a small but recognizable Chinese community had developed in the Limehouse area, to the consternation of white native-born Londoners, who feared [[Miscegenation|racial mixing]] and an influx of cheap labor. The entire Chinese population of London was only in the low hundreds\u2014in a city whose entire population was roughly estimated to be seven million\u2014but [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] feelings ran high, as was evidenced by the Aliens Act of 1905, a bundle of legislation which sought to restrict entry to poor and low-skilled foreign workers.<ref name=theparisreview>[https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/05/unspeakable-affections/ Unspeakable Affections] - Paris Review.

Its motives range from the desire of the Chinese to dominate Manila, to their desire to abort the Spaniards' moves which seemed to lead to their elimination. The Spaniards quelled the rebellion and massacred around 20,000 Chinese. The Chinese responded by fleeing to the [[Sulu Sultanate]] and supporting the Moro Muslims in their war against the Spanish. The Chinese supplied the Moros with weapons and joined them in directly fighting against the Spanish during the [[Spanish\u2013Moro conflict]]. Spain also upheld a plan to conquer China, but it never materialized.<ref>Samuel Hawley.

However, they were denied by law the rights of citizenship, including the right to vote, and in the 1880s, \"[[tax per head|head taxes]]\" were implemented to curtail immigration from China. In 1907, a riot in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] targeted Chinese and Japanese-owned businesses. In 1923, the federal government passed the ''[[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923|Chinese Immigration Act]]'', commonly known as the ''Exclusion Act'', prohibiting further Chinese immigration except under \"special circumstances\". The Exclusion Act was repealed in 1947, the same year in which [[Chinese Canadian]]s were given the right to vote. Restrictions would continue to exist on immigration from Asia until 1967, when all racial restrictions on [[immigration to Canada]] were repealed, and Canada adopted the current points based immigration system.
