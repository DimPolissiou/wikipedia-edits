On 2 June 1930, he married Irma Priest at St Andrews' Church in [[Subiaco, Western Australia|Subiaco]], with whom he was to have two sons and three daughters.\n\nIn the 1930s, he worked as a labourer and storeman, and became a foreman of sustenance gangs during the [[Great Depression]] who were digging contoured channels on dams in the [[South West (Western Australia)|South West]] region. By 1938, he was working for the Department of Water Supplies, and moved frequently with his young family as work demanded. He signed up for the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in 1941, but was rejected on medical grounds and was officially discharged on 9 February 1942. Around the same time, he settled in [[Innaloo, Western Australia|Innaloo]] and joined the Electricity and Gas Department of the [[City of Perth|Perth City Council]] (which became part of the [[State Electricity Commission of Western Australia|State Electricity Commission]] soon afterwards) as a linesman's assistant, and in 1949 he was promoted to linesman. He also became involved in the [[Australasian Society of Engineers]], in which he served as vice-president from 1947, and later as secretary.\n\nAt the [[1956 Western Australian state election|1956 state election]] on 7 April, he was elected for the [[Australian Labor Party (Western Australian Branch)|Labor Party]] to the seat of [[Electoral district of Wembley Beaches|Wembley Beaches]], which had hitherto been considered a safe seat for the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division)|Liberal Party]]. The previous Liberal member, [[Les Nimmo]], had decided to contest the seat of [[Electoral district of Leederville|Leederville]], and Marshall's strongest support came from his own suburb, where he obtained 66% of the vote. He resigned from his job at the State Electricity Commission and completed a term as a government backbencher. At the [[1959 Western Australian state election|1959 election]], with a statewide swing to the Liberals and with Nimmo recontesting the seat, he was defeated.\n\nAfter leaving politics he was employed by the Australasian Society of Engineers until 1962. Subsequently, he was re-employed by the SEC and relocated to [[Collie, Western Australia]] where he worked as clerk and then site clerk at [[Muja Power Station, Western Australia|Muja Power Station]], before retiring in 1967.\n\nHe died on 17 May 1975 in [[Karrinyup, Western Australia|Karrinyup]] and was cremated at [[Karrakatta Cemetery]].<ref name=blackbolton>{{Black and Bolton 2001|second=yes}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box|title=Member for [[Electoral district of Wembley Beaches|Wembley Beaches]]|before=[[Les Nimmo]]|after=[[Les Nimmo]]|years=1956\u20131959}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marshall, Frederick}}\n[[Category:1902 births]]\n[[Category:1975 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly]]\n[[Category:People from Grays]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian politicians]]\n[[Category:English emigrants to Australia]]\n[[Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Western Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=November 2016}}\n{{Infobox MLA | name =Frederick Marshall\n| birth_date      =6 June 1902\n| birth_place     =[[Grays]], [[Essex]], [[United Kingdom]]\n| death_date      =17 May 1975\n| death_place     =[[Karrinyup, Western Australia|Karrinyup]], [[Western Australia]]\n| constituency    =[[Electoral district of Wembley Beaches|Wembley Beaches]]\n| party           = [[Australian Labor Party (Western Australian Branch)|Labor]]\n| spouse          = Irma Robson\n| profession      = Electrical linesman\n| religion        = \n| signature       =\n| footnotes       =\n|}}\n\n'''Frederick Marshall''' (6 June 1902 &ndash; 17 May 1975) was an Australian politician, and a member of the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly]] from 1956 until 1959 representing the seats of [[Electoral district of Wembley Beaches|Wembley Beaches]].\n\n==Biography==\nMarshall was born in [[Grays]], [[Essex]], [[England]], to Benjamin Marshall, a general labourer and merchant seaman, and Jane n\u00e9e Rollingson, and was educated locally.

He signed up for the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in 1941, but was rejected on medical grounds and was officially discharged on 9 February 1942. Around the same time, he settled in [[Innaloo, Western Australia|Innaloo]] and joined the Electricity and Gas Department of the [[City of Perth|Perth City Council]] (which became part of the [[State Electricity Commission of Western Australia|State Electricity Commission]] soon afterwards) as a linesman's assistant, and in 1949 he was promoted to linesman. He also became involved in the [[Australasian Society of Engineers]], in which he served as vice-president from 1947, and later as secretary.\n\nAt the [[1956 Western Australian state election|1956 state election]] on 7 April, he was elected for the [[Australian Labor Party (Western Australian Branch)|Labor Party]] to the seat of [[Electoral district of Wembley Beaches|Wembley Beaches]], which had hitherto been considered a safe seat for the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division)|Liberal Party]]. The previous Liberal member, [[Les Nimmo]], had decided to contest the seat of [[Electoral district of Leederville|Leederville]], and Marshall's strongest support came from his own suburb, where he obtained 66% of the vote. He resigned from his job at the State Electricity Commission and completed a term as a government backbencher. At the [[1959 Western Australian state election|1959 election]], with a statewide swing to the Liberals and with Nimmo recontesting the seat, he was defeated.\n\nAfter leaving politics he was employed by the Australasian Society of Engineers until 1962. Subsequently, he was re-employed by the SEC and relocated to [[Collie, Western Australia]] where he worked as clerk and then site clerk at [[Muja Power Station, Western Australia|Muja Power Station]], before retiring in 1967.\n\nHe died on 17 May 1975 in [[Karrinyup, Western Australia|Karrinyup]] and was cremated at [[Karrakatta Cemetery]].<ref name=blackbolton>{{Black and Bolton 2001|second=yes}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box|title=Member for [[Electoral district of Wembley Beaches|Wembley Beaches]]|before=[[Les Nimmo]]|after=[[Les Nimmo]]|years=1956\u20131959}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marshall, Frederick}}\n[[Category:1902 births]]\n[[Category:1975 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly]]\n[[Category:People from Grays]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian politicians]]\n[[Category:English emigrants to Australia]]\n[[Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Western Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toGrays(link changed toGrays, Essex; link changed toGrays, Essex) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Marshall_(politician)"}
