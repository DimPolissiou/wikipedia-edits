Initiated by the architect and [[Driehaus Architecture Prize|Driehaus Prize]] winner [[L\u00e9on Krier]] in the spirit of the [[New Urbanism|urban village]], it enjoys the keen endorsement of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], on whose land it is built ([[Duchy of Cornwall]]). Due for completion in 2025, it is expected to house a population of 6,000. Poundbury currently provides employment for over 2,000 people in over 180 businesses.\n\nPoundbury has been praised for reviving the low-rise streetscape built to the human scale, and for echoing traditional local design features. But it has also been criticised as artificially nostalgic, and it has not succeeded in reducing car dependence.\n\n==Mission==\nPoundbury has been built according to the principles of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], who is known for holding strong views challenging the [[post-war]] trends in [[town planning]] that were suburban in character. Since starting in 1993, the town has received both criticism and praise from architects and design critics.\n\nThe development is built to a traditional high-density urban pattern, rather than a suburban one, focused on creating an integrated community of shops, businesses, and private and [[social housing]]. There is no [[zoning]]. The planners say they are designing the development around people rather than the car, and they aim to provide a high-quality environment, from the architecture to the selection of materials, to the signposts, and the [[landscaping]]. To avoid constant construction, utilities are buried in [[common utility duct]]s under the town. Common areas are maintained by a management company to which all residents belong. It consists of 35 percent social housing and is designed for [[sustainable development]],<ref>{{cite news |title=About Poundbury |url=http://www.poundburycommercial.com/about-poundbury/ |accessdate=15 July 2018 |publisher=www.poundburycommercial.com}}</ref> which includes [[carbon neutrality]].<ref>Pentreath, Ben, ''[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/94e6c310-3c8f-11e3-a8c4-00144feab7de.html How the Poundbury project became a model for innovation]'', ''Financial Times'', 1 November 2013</ref>\n\nTo some degree, the project shows similarities with the contemporary [[New Urbanism]] movement.

Initiated by the architect and [[Driehaus Architecture Prize|Driehaus Prize]] winner [[L\u00e9on Krier]] in the spirit of the [[New Urbanism|urban village]], it enjoys the keen endorsement of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], on whose land it is built ([[Duchy of Cornwall]]). Due for completion in 2025, it is expected to house a population of 6,000. Poundbury currently provides employment for over 2,000 people in over 180 businesses.\n\nPoundbury has been praised for reviving the low-rise streetscape built to the human scale, and for echoing traditional local design features. But it has also been criticised as artificially nostalgic, and it has not succeeded in reducing car dependence.\n\n==Mission==\nPoundbury has been built according to the principles of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], who is known for holding strong views challenging the [[post-war]] trends in [[town planning]] that were suburban in character. Since starting in 1993, the town has received both criticism and praise from architects and design critics.\n\nThe development is built to a traditional high-density urban pattern, rather than a suburban one, focused on creating an integrated community of shops, businesses, and private and [[social housing]]. There is no [[zoning]]. The planners say they are designing the development around people rather than the car, and they aim to provide a high-quality environment, from the architecture to the selection of materials, to the signposts, and the [[landscaping]]. To avoid constant construction, utilities are buried in [[common utility duct]]s under the town. Common areas are maintained by a management company to which all residents belong. It consists of 35 percent social housing and is designed for [[sustainable development]],<ref>{{cite news |title=About Poundbury |url=http://www.poundburycommercial.com/about-poundbury/ |accessdate=15 July 2018 |publisher=www.poundburycommercial.com}}</ref> which includes [[carbon neutrality]].<ref>Pentreath, Ben, ''[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/94e6c310-3c8f-11e3-a8c4-00144feab7de.html How the Poundbury project became a model for innovation]'', ''Financial Times'', 1 November 2013</ref>\n\nTo some degree, the project shows similarities with the contemporary [[New Urbanism]] movement.

Its members applied the respective techniques in projects for e.g. health analytics, crime analytics, education, business analytics. Fundamental research is being performed for feature selection, dynamic data mining, evolutionary algorithms, ubiquitous computing, among others. This group also disseminates research, development, and applications related to data science through conferences, seminars, and executive education courses.\n\n=== Consumer Analytics ===\n\nThis group focuses on the study of managerial decisions using empirical and normative models to characterize behavior and decision-making process of agents, which play a key role to improve the efficiency of the system. To analyze such systems, agent decisions are modeled using methods from a broad set of disciplines, including operations research, microeconomics, behavioral economics and consumer psychology.\n\nThe group has several research projects in collaboration with industry and public institutions, including: large [[Retail chains|big-box retail chains]], [[retail banking]], hotels, restaurants, hospitals, online market platforms, government procurement agencies, judicial courts, airlines, [[Competition law|antitrust regulation]], consumer protection agencies, among many more. Several of these projects have led to actual implementations that are currently been used in practice.\n\nThe group has an active research network with scholars from top business and engineering schools, such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and others.

Although it was initially not successful, the lead single, \"[[Who Will Save Your Soul]]\" eventually reached No. 11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], pressing the album to later sell over twelve million copies. In addition, \"[[You Were Meant for Me (Jewel song)|You Were Meant for Me]]\" and \"[[Foolish Games]]\" each became Top 10 hits on the same ''Billboard'' chart. Her second album ''[[Spirit (Jewel album)|Spirit]]'' was released in November 1998, certifying 4&times; Multi-Platinum in the United States. Its first single entitled \"[[Hands (Jewel song)|Hands]]\" reached No. 6 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 that year. Her 2001 release ''[[This Way (Jewel album)|This Way]]'' followed similar suit, certifying Platinum in the United States and producing the Top 30 hit, \"[[Standing Still (Jewel song)|Standing Still]]\".\n\nHer fourth album ''[[0304]]'' was released in June 2003 and aimed towards a more [[Pop music|pop]] sound. It reached No. 2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and certified Gold in the United States. The album's sound did not bring as major success as her previous releases, with its first single becoming the only major hit. In May 2006, her sixth album entitled ''[[Goodbye Alice in Wonderland]]'' was released, reaching No. 8 in the United States. Its sound was a departure from ''0304'', as it sound contained more elements that had originated in her debut album. Working with the country band, [[Big and Rich]], Jewel issued her first country album in June 2008 titled ''[[Perfectly Clear]].''<ref name=\"allmusicbio\"/> The release reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart and spawned the major country hit, \"[[Stronger Woman]]\".

However, the term \"junior college\" is now usually used to characterize private two-year institutions. The term \"community college\" has evolved to describe publicly funded two-year institutions. The main national advocacy organization for community colleges, which was founded in 1920 as the \"American Association of Junior Colleges,\" changed its name in 1992 to the \"[[American Association of Community Colleges]]\".<ref>{{cite web|title=About AACC: Who We Are|url=http://www.aacc.nche.edu/About/Who/Pages/default.aspx|website=American Association of Community Colleges|accessdate=12 February 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211170321/http://www.aacc.nche.edu/About/Who/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=11 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:UCC Gymnasium.jpg|thumb|right|A gymnasium at [[Union County College]] in Cranford, New Jersey.]]\n[[File:6.15.11HudsonCountyCommunityCollegeNorthCampusByLuigiNovi2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Building.|[[Hudson County Community College]] in Union City, NJ.]]\n\nCohen and  Brawer  noted other names: city college, county college (in New Jersey), and branch campus.  Other common components of the school  name include  vocational, technical, [[adult education]] and technical institute.  Nicknames include \"democracy's college\" and \"opportunity college.\"  <ref>Arthur M. Cohen and Florence B. Brawer, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vVbn9X6Wx6YC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false The American Community College]'' (4th ed. 2003) p 4</ref>\n\nIn several Californian cities and in other large cities such as [[Chicago]], with its [[City Colleges of Chicago]], community colleges are often called \"city colleges\", since they are municipally funded and designed to serve the needs of the residents of the city in which they are situated.  Also, the state's public two-year colleges are not solely found in its larger cities.\n\nNew York City's network of community colleges was established outside of the CUNY system, and integrated into that system at the insistence of the state government. Another example is [[Westchester Community College]]. In the late 1940s, the county operated a popular vocational institute. The New York state government required that the county transform its technical institute into a community college. The county government resisted this transformation, as it would be responsible for a third of the new institution's operating costs (in contrast, the state paid for all of the technical institute's operating costs). After a series of very heated meetings, fully reported in the local press, the county was forced to conform to the state government's wishes.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe origins, purposes, and funding of public two-year colleges varies widely among the states and, as in California, within states. Because the role played by rural community colleges in preparing excess rural youth for productive careers in urban centers is not well understood by policy makers, these smaller institutions do not receive sufficient state funding to offset their weak tax bases and, because of their relatively small size, much higher per-student costs when compared to urban community colleges. This inequity in basic institutional funding has led to the creation of such organizations as the [[Community Colleges of Appalachia]] and the tribal college association, which have sought to promote more equitable funding irrespective of an institution's size or location.{{dubious|date=November 2019}}\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early community colleges===\nBefore 1850, a few public institutions offered two years of college: [[Lasell Junior College]] in Auburndale, Massachusetts, and [[Vincennes University]] of Vincennes, Indiana. Helland cites a section from the 1899 Vincennes University catalog: \u201cThe Vincennes University occupies a unique position in the educational field. It is half-way between the commissioned high school and the full-fledged college: it is in fact a junior college.\u201d<ref>Phillip C. Helland, ''Establishment of Public Junior and Community Colleges in Minnesota 1914\u20131983,'' (Saint Paul, MN: Minnesota Community College System, 1987), p. 1.</ref>\n\nMany early community colleges were [[normal school]]s that prepared school teachers. Primary emphasis was placed on traditional middle class values and developing responsible citizens. As an example, Normal Schools began in the State of Massachusetts in the 1880s as extensions of local high schools. They were originated to meet the need for teacher preparation. In Saint Joseph, Missouri, a Normal School was added to the local high school to provide a career track for women who wanted to teach. Mr. Whiteford, the area's district superintendent, inquired of the [[University of Missouri]] to determine if credits from Saint Joseph Normal School could transfer into a baccalaureate program. The University's President Dr. Hill acknowledged the request and provided for the articulation. Coincidentally, Dr. Hill was actively involved in the American Association of Universities and calling for the establishment of junior colleges for this purpose.\n\nIn Minnesota, St. Paul's Public School District established a \u201cCity Training School\u201d for preparing teachers.<ref>B. F. Wright, \u201cAnnual Report of the Superintendent,\u201d Annual Report of the Board of Education. Saint Paul, MN: Globe Office. June 1883, 76\u201378.</ref>  The 1883 school's mission was to provide certified teachers and substitutes for the district. Mrs. M. E. Jenness from the Normal School at River Falls, Wisconsin, was the St. Paul School's first principal; Mrs. N. F. Wheaton was the Director of Practice. Wheaton had been employed at the Oshkosh Normal School in Wisconsin. In Minneapolis, a Normal Training School was instituted in the fall of 1887. Miss Adele Evers of Manchester Normal School in New Hampshire was appointed the first teacher; she was one of six candidates for the position.  Evers\u2019 references included work at Martha's Vineyard and Saratoga.<ref>John E. Bradley, \u201cSuperintendent\u2019s Report,\u201d The Tenth Annual Report of the Board of Education of the City of Minneapolis, Minneapolis: Tribune Job Printing Company. June 30, 1887, 17\u201319.</ref>\n\nBaltimore's Manual Training High School opened in 1884, was the first separate secondary school for education that was specifically work orientated.<ref>William H. Dooley, Industrial Education, (Cambridge: Riverside Press, 1919)</ref>  The Maryland institution was unique as a stand-alone campus. Other examples of sub-baccalaureate programs were the University Preparatory School and Junior College of Tonkawa. The result of the two- year schools founded in Oklahoma Public School Secondary System in 1902, both institutions later merged in 1914 and became the [[Oklahoma Institute of Technology]]. Dean Schneider of the [[University of Cincinnati]] developed an alternative high school with a cooperative plan where students spent one week in an occupation and the other in school. Industry provided the shop experiences and the classroom facilitated the academic.<ref>Charles A. Prosser and Charles A. Allen. Vocational Education in a Democracy. (New York: The Century Co., 1925), 225</ref>  There were also non-cooperative high schools; two examples were the Girl's Vocational High School in Kansas City, Missouri and the Delgado Trade School in New Orleans. A two-year, terminal education, was seen as more socially efficient for students who could advance past high school but not continue to attain bachelor's degrees. This national vocational movement gave junior colleges a target population, but numerous students wanted more than a semiprofessional education; many maintained a desire to transfer. Throughout this time period, there was a move for more public two-year institutions along with a trend to separate from high schools and affiliate with higher education. With the change in affiliation came a new status which encouraged junior colleges to develop additional credibility through the creation of professional criteria and use of scientific methods.\n\nBrint and Karabel conclude that \u201cThe two-year college has been a distinctively American creation, and nowhere else has it attained such prominence.\u201d<ref>Stephen Brint and Jerome Karabel, ''The Diverted Dream: Community Colleges and the Promise of Educational Opportunity in America, 1900\u20131985'' (Oxford University Press, 1989), p 19.</ref>  J. L. Ratcliff.<ref>James L. Ratcliff \u201cSeven Streams in the Historical Development of the Modern American Community College\u201d in ''A Handbook Of The Community College In America'' Ed. George A. Baker III (1994)</ref> suggests one perspective for the emergence of two-year post secondary institutions of the past century: they began in the private sector after the [[Panic of 1893]]. At that time of severe financial hardship J. M. Carroll, president of Baylor University, made a pragmatic suggestion to solve the problem of too many Baptist colleges with insufficient funds and not enough students to support them: reduce the smaller Baptist colleges\u2019 curriculum to the freshman and sophomore years. After this preliminary period, [[Baylor University]] accepted the two-year students and provided the junior and senior years of their academic plan. Carroll hoped this split would require fewer faculty and resources for the first two years of higher education.\n\nIn the larger cities early public community colleges were often an extension of [[high school]]s, like the first established, [[Joliet Junior College]], in Illinois in 1901. These initial community colleges generally were small (usually fewer than 200 students) and focused on a liberal arts education with the goal of [[college transfer|transferring]] students to four-year colleges. They reflected high school needs and lacked a definite identity. These examples of two-year structure innovations with transfer missions in the private and public sector provided a pragmatic approach for the preservation of existing institutions.\n\nJunior colleges grew in number from 20 in 1909 to 170 in 1919. By 1922, 37 states had set up 70 junior colleges, enrolling about 150 students each.  Meanwhile, another 137 were privately operated, with about 60 students each. Rapid expansion continued in the 1920s, with 440 junior colleges in 1930 enrolling about 70,000 students.  The peak year for private institutions came in 1949, when there were 322 junior colleges; 180 were affiliated with churches, 108 were independent non-profit, and 34 were private Schools run for-profit.<ref>Cohen and Brawer, ''The American Community College'' (4th ed. 2003) p 13-14</ref>\n\nMany factors contributed to rapid growth of community colleges. Students parents and businessmen wanted nearby, low-cost schools to provide training for the growing white collar labor force and for more advanced technical blue collar jobs. Four-year colleges were also growing, but not as fast; however many were located in rural or small-town areas away from the fast-growing metropolis.\n\nSeveral different movements supported the creation of community colleges, including local community support of public and private two-year institutions, the expansion of the public education system, increased professional standards for teachers, the vocational education movement, and an expanding demand for adult and community education. Numerous colleges and universities advocated for the development of junior colleges. Leadership felt small, private liberal arts colleges and high schools could provide the first two years of college while larger universities could focus resources on research and junior and senior level students.\n\n===Depression era===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s there was a shift in the purpose of community colleges to developing a workforce, which was influenced by wide unemployment during the [[Great Depression]]. Developing \"semiprofessionals\" became dominant national language to describe junior college students. The notion that engineers and supervisors make primary decisions about what and how activities were to be done in the workplace provided the origins for employees needed to carry out their decisions. This need for a class of workers to implement the decisions of the theoreticians demanded an educational delivery system other than the traditional four-year college or university. The closed shop of the artisan which had initially provided workers was no longer the educational program of choice. Nationally, a new two-year vehicle for educating the industrial worker found its launching within the secondary public school system under the leadership of local school districts.\n\n===Cold War era===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nAfter [[World War II]], the [[G.I. Bill]] afforded more educational opportunity to veterans which resulted in increased enrollments. Another factor that led to growth was the rise of adult and community education. After World War II, community colleges were seen as a good place to house continuing education programs. The 1947 [[President's Commission on Higher Education]] was an important national document for community colleges. It established a network of public community colleges that would provide education to a diverse group of students at little or no cost along with serving community needs through a comprehensive mission.\n\nThis national network exploded in the 1960s with 457 community colleges and the enrollment of [[baby boomer]]s. A series of grants through the Kellogg Junior College Leadership Programs helped train many community college leaders during this decade.\n\n[[Merritt College]], a junior college (and now a community college) in Oakland, California, was the site for organizing and educating members of the [[Black Panthers]] in the mid- to late-1960s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CKFlirjb2EAC&pg=PP1&dq=merritt+college+black+panthers#v=onepage&q=merritt%20college%20black%20panthers&f=false|title=Black Against Empire|work=google.com|isbn=9780520271852|last1=Bloom|first1=Joshua|author2=Waldo E Martin JR|last3=Martin|first3=Waldo E.|date=2013-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/facpub/479/|title=\"The Black Panther Party's Narratives of Resistance\" by David Ray Papke|work=marquette.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jsh/summary/v042/42.1.rogers.html|title=Project MUSE \u2013 The Marginalization of the Black Campus Movement|work=jhu.edu}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, growth continued when many enrolled to escape the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam era draft]]. The 1970s also marked a shift to faculty development, including more instructional training for the unique student body and mission of community colleges. In 1976, Coastline Community College was launched as the first \"college without walls,\" using television, a precursor today's online programs as well as using community facilities. During the 1980s, community colleges began to work more closely with high schools to prepare students for vocational and technical two-year programs.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, two-year community colleges were playing important roles in higher education as access mechanisms. They became an integral feature for those persons who were attending higher education for the first time or as non-traditional students. Brint and Karabel<ref>Stephen Brint and Jerome Karabel, The Diverted Dream: Community Colleges and the Promise of Educational Opportunity in America, 1900\u20131985.</ref>  have recognized the change that transpired from 1920 when fewer than 2 percent of all college freshmen were enrolled in a two-year college to the late 1980s when over 50 percent were matriculated. Junior colleges once located in high schools had left their origins to develop their own campuses and were called community colleges and still retained the transfer access mission. High school normal schools matured into teacher colleges or colleges of education within universities offering bachelor and graduate degrees. Industrial institutes integrated with local junior colleges to make these campus's programs more comprehensive community colleges. Along with this growth and legitimization of two-year mechanisms for the delivery of higher education, the emergence of two-year institutions provided an epistemological debate that divided the river of education flowing into the early 20th century into three streams of educational natures. \u201cIn the process of this struggle and adjustment some colleges will grow stronger, some will become academies, some junior colleges; the high schools will be elevated to a still more important position than that which they now occupy. The general result will be the growth of a system in the higher educational work of the United States, where now no system exists.\u201d<ref>William Rainey Harper, The Prospects of the Small College. (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1900), 45\u201346.</ref>\n\n===1990s and 2000s===\nIn recent history, a debate between the advocates and critics of community colleges gained strength. Advocates argued that community colleges served the needs of society by providing college opportunity to students who [[Post Secondary Transition For High School Students with Disabilities|otherwise cannot go to college]], training and retraining mid-level [[skilled worker]]s, and preserving the academic excellence of four-year universities. Critics argued that community colleges continued a culture of privilege through training business workers at public expense, not allowing the working class to advance in social class, protecting selective admissions at four-year institutions for the nation's elite, and discouraging transfer through [[cooling out]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Clark |first=Burton R. |year=1960 |title=The \"cooling-out\" function in higher education |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=569\u2013575 |doi=10.1086/222787 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the growth of community colleges has stabilized, enrollment continued to outgrow four-year institutions.

According to the Education Commission of the States there are three major types of higher education governance systems in the states; they are Governing Board States, Coordinating Board States and Planning/ Regulatory/Service Agency States. (from: [http://www.ecs.org The Education Commission of the States website])\n\n'''Governing board states (GBS)'''\n\nState-level governing boards are distinguished according to whether they are responsible for consolidated systems or multi-campus systems. Consolidated systems are composed of several previously independently governed institutions that were later consolidated into one system. Multi-campus systems developed primarily through extensions of various branches or campuses.\n\n'''Coordinating board states'''\n\nCoordinating boards vary significantly in formal authority and informal power and influence from state to state.  Generally, there is a state level board governing universities, colleges, and community colleges.  Each university and community college district will have its own board that is accountable to a state-coordinating agency.\n\n'''The Planning/Regulatory/Service Agency States (PRSA)'''\n\nThe PRSA states have limited or non-existent formal governing or coordinating authority, which carry out regulatory and service functions such as student financial aid.\n\nFor a comprehensive list of American community colleges and their state level governing boards:  ''[http://www.utexas.edu/world/comcol/state U.S. Community Colleges by State, University of Texas at Austin]''\n\nA more thorough description of state level college and university governance models can be found at: ''Models of Postsecondary Education Coordination and Governance in the States''\n\n<big>'''Local governance'''</big>\n\nMost community colleges are operated within special districts that draw property tax revenue from the local community, as a division of a state university, or as a sister institution within a statewide higher education system.\n\nIn all cases, community colleges are governed by a board of trustees, appointed by the state governor, or the board is elected by citizens residing within the community college district. In some instances, as with the City Colleges of Chicago, the board of trustees is appointed by the presiding local government.  In Chicago, it is the mayor who appoints the board.\n\nDepending on the operational system, the board of trustees may directly govern the college or may govern the college through a university or system-level office. Depending upon the locus of control, the board may or may not be subject to control by a state agency that supervises all community college districts or all higher education institutions within the state.\n\nThe board of trustees selects a president or chancellor of the community college to serve as the chief executive officer and lead the faculty and staff.\n\n<big>'''Multi-college district'''</big>\n\nMulti-college community college districts include several individually accredited community colleges within one district.  Each college is independent with distinct local administration, but they share a single board of trustees and report to a non-instructional central administrative office.\n\nThe Contra Costa Community College District is an example of one of the largest multi-college community college districts in California. The District consists of Contra Costa College, Diablo Valley College, Los Medanos College, San Ramon Campus, and Brentwood Center, and annually serves almost 62,000 students.\n\n<big>'''Multi-campus district'''</big>\n\nLarger schools implement a multi-campus system and generally share a single accreditation.  Local administrative governance varies. Extension campuses report to the main campus administration or a central administrative office.  A good example of this is [[College of DuPage]] in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, which has 6 satellite campuses within a 10-mile area, in addition to its main campus, which itself has 9 structures and an enrollment of over 30,000 students.\n\n<big>'''Faculty governance'''</big>\n\n'''Faculty senates and councils'''\n\nA faculty senate, or faculty council as this body is sometimes referred to, is the representative body of all faculty who participate in the governance processes of the community college. As with all governing bodies, the faculty senate is usually governed by a constitution and a set of bylaws specific to the college.  Membership in this body varies from college, with most restricting voting rights to tenured and tenure track faculty, and others allowing a wider array of members to include full-time, adjunct, continuing education, technical, and adult basic education faculty. (modified from: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110727185727/http://www.pima.edu/facsenate/ Pima Community College : Faculty Senate])\n\nThough this is not an exhaustive list, the mission of the faculty senate at the community college usually includes: matters concerning curricular decisions; strengthening the concept of the faculty as a college entity; promoting the gathering, exchanging, and disseminating of faculty views and concerns regarding college matters; promoting mutual accountability between the college faculty and the faculty representative to any college committee; advising the Chancellor and other administrators of faculty views on college matters; bringing the concerns of the Chancellor and other administrators on college matters to the faculty; promoting the involvement of all faculty members in the establishing, staffing, and functioning of college committees, task forces, or other initiatives; and participating in the policy review process of the college.\n\n<big>'''Collective bargaining units/agreements'''</big>\n\nMost community college faculty are bargained for employees.  While unions and their respective collective bargaining agreements serve to protect faculty rights and working conditions, collective bargaining agreements, or union contracts, provide faculty with a defined set of rules and regulations they must follow as a condition of employment.\nCollective bargaining swept into higher education on the coattails of legislation authorizing public employees to negotiate. As these laws were passed in various states in the 1960s and 1970s, employee groups ranging from refuse collectors to prison guards gained union representation and began negotiating contracts (Cohen & Brawer, 2008, p.&nbsp;147)\n\nCollective bargaining units exist for all divisions of community college faculty; however, participation by faculty groups differs from college to college.\n\n<big>'''Student governance'''</big>\n\nThere is a student government organizational presence on close to every community college campus in America The Student Government organization is the official voice of the student body, a vital link in effective student participation in all areas of student concern in relationship to the college's administration. By advocating student rights and services, the organization represents the student body and presents its concerns to the college administration, local, and national issues.  Through the Student Government organizations the college provides students with essential leadership experience, and valuable connections with faculty, staff administration, students, and the Board of Trustees.  Student involvement is usually based on criteria set by the institution; all students have the right as a student to participate in democratic process on campus.

Colleges are very special types of institutions with a unique mission\u2014the creation and dissemination of ideas. At the heart of shared governance is the belief that decision-making should be largely independent of short-term managerial and political considerations.  Faculty and professional staff are in the best position to shape and implement curriculum and research policy, to select academic colleagues and judge their work; and The perspective of all front-line personnel is invaluable in making sound decisions about allocating resources, setting goals, choosing top officers and guiding student life.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of governance at the community college, please see the AAUP's 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities and the 1998 statement on the same topic by the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges.  These documents more clearly define those matters that are the responsibility of the voting faculty and those reserved to the governing body and its delegates.

That is, anyone with a [[high school diploma]] or [[General Educational Development|GED]] may attend, regardless of academic status or [[college entrance exam]] scores. Students however do take [[placement testing|placement tests]] before enrolling, because not all courses are open admission. In California and Minnesota, students reaching age 18 are not required to have completed secondary education, but they must show an \"[[ability to benefit]]\" from a college's educational program. Under certain circumstances, community colleges also accept high school students or dropouts.\n\nThe open admission policy results in a wide range of students attending community college classes. Students range in age from teenagers in [[high school]] taking classes under a concurrent, or dual, enrollment policy (which allows both high school and college credits to be earned simultaneously) to working adults taking classes at night to complete a degree or gain additional skills in their field to students with graduate degrees who enroll to become more employable or to pursue lifelong interests. \"Reverse transfers\" (or those transferring from a university) constitute one of the fastest growing new community college cohorts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nOne threat to enrollment at community colleges has been the increasing popularity of for-profit e-learning and online universities.

Average Bachelor's completion rates are 10% higher for students that transferred to public four-year institutions than those who transferred to private non-profit four-year institutions. Community college students who transferred to very selective four-year institutions had bachelor's completion rates that were on average 36 percentage points higher than those of students who transferred to non-selective institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED563499.pdf|title=Tracking Transfer: New Measures of Institutional and State Effectiveness in Helping Community College Students Attain Bachelor's Degrees.|last=Jenkins|first=Davis|date=2016|website=Community College Research Center, Teachers College, Columbia University.|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Educational offerings ==\nCommunity colleges generally offer a range of programs. The majority of programs are offered on campus, however, distance and online educational opportunities have become increasingly common. Virtually all community colleges now offer courses and programs online.\n\n===Remedial education===\nAccording to the [[Center for Community College Student Engagement]], 68 percent of community college students require remedial coursework.<ref>https://www.ccsse.org/docs/underprepared_student.pdf</ref>\n\n===Associate degree===\nIn study towards an [[associate degree]], a student takes necessary courses needed to earn a degree that will allow for entry into jobs requiring some level of college education but not a full four-year degree. The associate degree program also allows students who wish to eventually obtain a [[bachelor's degree]] at a four-year college to complete the necessary \"core\" requirements to attend the college of their choice. Some states have mandated that the community college's curriculum be structured so as to satisfy \"core curriculum\" requirements at the state's public universities or private universities.\n\nMany community colleges have [[Articulation (education)|articulation]] arrangements with nearby four-year institutions, where a student obtaining an associate degree in a field will automatically have his/her classes counted toward the bachelor's degree requirement. For example, a community college associate degree in hotel and restaurant management, computers or accounting would count toward the four-year school's core requirement for a Business Administration degree. Some have gone one step further by arrangements with a four-year college for the student to obtain the bachelor's degree from the four-year college while taking all the courses via [[distance learning]] or other non-traditional modes, thus reducing the number of physical visits to the four-year school. One such example is [[College of DuPage]] (COD) in Illinois, who have implemented a program called 3+1. In this program, students can take three years of classes at the community college taught by COD professors and faculty, and in the fourth year attend classes on the COD campus, but taught by professors of nearby partner universities, such as [[Benedictine University]], [[Concordia University]], [[Governors State University]], [[Lewis University]], and [[Roosevelt University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cod.edu/academics/transfer_programs/3plus1.aspx|title=College of DuPage \u2013 3+1 Degree Programs \u2013 Earn Your Bachelor's Degree|work=cod.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Certification===\nCertification in an area of [[training]] (such as [[Licensed Practical Nurse|nursing]], [[computer repair]], [[allied health]], [[Police|law enforcement]], [[firefighting]], or [[welding]]), which require preparation for a state or national examination, or where certification would allow for hiring preference or a higher salary upon entering the workforce. These courses are often geared toward the needs of the local or area business community.\n\n===Local services===\nServices of local interest to members of the community, such as job placement, adult continuing education classes (either for personal achievement or to maintain certification in specialized fields), and developmental classes for children. Some community colleges offer opportunities for high school dropouts to return to school and earn a high school diploma or obtain a GED.\n\n=== Bachelor's degrees ===\n\nA growing trend in the United States is for community colleges to begin offering bachelor's degrees. As of 2013, nineteen states have authorized their community colleges to offer bachelor's degrees with California passing authorizing legislation in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accbd.org/resources/baccalaureate-conferring-locations/?ct=US|title=Baccalaureate Conferring Locations|author=|publisher=Community College Baccalaureate Association|date=October 2013|accessdate=2015-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/29/the-10-000-community-college-ba|title=The $10,000 Community College B.A.: California is the latest state to allow community colleges to offer select bachelor's degree programs.|author= Allie Bidwell|magazine=U.S. News & World Report|date=2014-09-29|accessdate=2015-01-23}}</ref>\n\nMany large community colleges, such as [[Miami-Dade College]] and [[St. Petersburg College]], in [[Florida]] have even completely dropped the words \"community\" or \"junior\" from their names as they have added bachelor's degree programs in limited fields and have started their evolution into four-year colleges while retaining their local commitments. Even some smaller community colleges, such as [[Northern New Mexico College]] in [[Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico]], have dropped community from their names and now offer six or more bachelor's degrees.<ref>[http://www.nnmc.edu/about/BaccalaureatePrograms.shtml]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509161917/http://www.nnmc.edu/about/BaccalaureatePrograms.shtml|date=May 9, 2008}}</ref> A few of the larger institutions, such as [[De Anza College]] in northern California and [[College of DuPage]] near Chicago, who both boast enrollment of over 25,000 students, continue to explore the [[cost-benefit analysis]] in offering 4-year degrees.  In more rural communities, community colleges may host branches of the local state university, and community colleges with specialized programs may offer four-year degrees in conjunction with other schools, some miles away. For instance, [[Southern Illinois University]] offers aviation management bachelor's degrees at [[Mt. San Antonio College]] and [[Palomar College]] in Southern California.\n\n== Advantages of community colleges ==\n* Community colleges emphasize the needs of local students and the local job market. Students who could not afford campus or off-site housing at a four-year college, or for other reasons cannot relocate, can attend courses while staying in their local community (though some colleges do offer student housing). They can even benefit university graduates, since some four-year schools fail to prepare their graduates for the kinds of jobs that are available in their surrounding regions. Over seven percent of the nation's community college students already possess a bachelor's degree. At some colleges, the figure is close to twenty percent.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://hechingerreport.org/graduates-of-four-year-universities-flock-to-community-colleges-for-job-skills/\n | title =Graduates of four-year universities flock to community colleges for job skills\n | last =Krupnick\n | first =Matt\n | date =28 October 2015\n | website =Hechinger Report\n | publisher =[[Teachers College, Columbia University]]\n | access-date =29 October 2015\n | quote =There\u2019s a lot of disciplines universities aren\u2019t offering. }}</ref>\n* Although an [[associate degree]] is typically less financially lucrative in the long term than a bachelor's degree, it can still provide a respectable income at much less cost in time, tuition, student loans, and lost earnings, along with the option of upgrading to a bachelor's degree at a later time.

In comparison, a large university college course may be taught to 300+ students by a teaching assistant, while the professor attends to research duties {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}. Outside of those teaching in the technical and vocational fields, most instructors at community colleges have [[master's degree]]s and many hold [[Doctorate|doctoral]] degrees. In addition, community college professors can help students achieve their goals, work more closely with them, and offer them support, while at four-year colleges and universities, a professor is also often expected to conduct academic research, and in some cases, to mentor [[graduate students]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Agrawal|first=Chad|title=Community College Transfer|url=http://www.communitycollegetransferstudents.com|work=Community College Transfer Students|accessdate=September 12, 2011}}</ref>\n* A number of community colleges have athletic programs; certain colleges also serve as incubators for college athletes, particularly in [[baseball]], [[basketball]] and [[college football|football]]. A talented player who would not meet the academic or athletic standards of a major college program may be able to play for two years in junior college, establishing an academic record in the process, and then transfer to the major college.<ref name=NYT-powell-042207>Robert Andrew Powell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/education/edlife/sport22.html?ref=edlife Community College: Tennis in a Parking Lot], ''The New York Times'', April 22, 2007</ref>\n*Community colleges offer far more academic flexibility than traditional four-year colleges and universities by giving students the opportunity to take more night classes and online courses. This is especially important for students that have to work, or have family obligations, while they are pursuing a degree. For those students that have to work or want to ease their way into the world of higher education, community college allows them to move at their own pace.\n*Contrary to popular belief, federal and private financial aid is also available to community college students. Federal student loans require students to only be enrolled half time \u2013 usually six credit hours or two college courses. In order for community college students to keep their financial aid, they just need to make sure they do not drop out of school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/community-colleges/slideshows/10-reasons-to-attend-a-community-college|title=10 Reasons to Attend a Community College|last=Mitchell|first=Travis|date=July 10, 2019|website=U.S. News|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Private loans are also beginning to become options for community college students. Private lenders are also beginning to offer loans for students attending two-year colleges and technical schools.\n*The science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, otherwise known as STEM, field is growing at a fast pace. Many careers in the STEM field are in high demand, and numerous community colleges have associate degree programs to help students with that first step in their college career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/community-colleges/slideshows/10-reasons-to-attend-a-community-college?slide=3|title=10 Reasons to Attend a Community College|last=Mitchell|first=Travis|date=July 10, 2019|website=U.S. News|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> According to the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University, STEM majors are the highest paying, with an average salary of $65,000 or more annually over the course of a recipient\u2019s career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/valueofcollegemajors/|title=The Economic Value of College Majors|date=2015-05-07|website=CEW Georgetown|language=en|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n== Disadvantages of community colleges ==\n* Transferring [[Credit (education)|credits]] can sometimes be a problem, as each four-year college has its own requirements for enrollment. However, many four-year colleges (usually near the community college) have made arrangements, known as articulation agreements, allowing associate degrees to qualify for transfer, some cases allowing the student to complete the bachelor's degree via [[distance learning]] from the community college campus. Some states have passed rules whereby certain associate degrees in a field will automatically transfer to state universities as the core curriculum for specified bachelor's degrees.  [[Minnesota]], Alabama, and Oregon have created a statewide \"transfer curriculum\" allowing credits to be transferred to any other public university and almost all of the private colleges. The North Carolina system has a similar agreement, whereby specific courses are designated for mandatory transfer credit to all statewide public four-year institutions. Illinois's [http://www.itransfer.org/ I-transfer program] program aids students in transferring credits across the state. California has a system known as Assist,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assist.org/|title=Welcome to ASSIST|work=assist.org}}</ref> which labels course equivalencies between all California Community Colleges and California public four-year colleges. Texas has a similar system known as [http://www.tccns.org/ TCCN] for labelling course equivalencies between all Texas Community Colleges and Texas public four-year institutions. \n* It is frequent for many courses to be taught by part-time [[lecturer]]s, [[Adjunct professors|adjuncts]], or [[contingent labor]], some with only a bachelor's degree in the field. Research conducted by the University of Washington's Labor Center suggests that community colleges' reliance on part-time (adjunct) faculty results in lower graduation rates than colleges with a full-time workforce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidehighered.com/news/2006/10/16/parttime|title=Adjuncts and Graduation Rates|work=insidehighered.com}}</ref> \n*According to federal statistics, 42% of public community college freshmen take remedial courses, and further studies show that 79% of remedial courses are taught by part-time faculty.<ref name=NYT-Merrow3-042207>John Merrow, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/education/edlife/22merrow-profile-3.html Community Colleges: A Harsh Reality], ''The New York Times'', April 22, 2007.</ref>\n* Individuals with associate degrees usually earn less than those with bachelor's degrees.<ref>See [[Personal income in the United States]] \u2013 chart on income by educational attainment.</ref>\n* While community colleges are open enrollment institutions, meaning they accept and enroll all prospective students as long as fees are paid and the student enrolls in classes, this open door policy is often seen as a revolving door, with many students, nearly 2/3 not completing their education.<ref>Boggs, G.

These schools typically offer six facets of education: \n# Transfer education \u2013 The traditional two-year student who will then transfer to a four-year institution to pursue a BS/BA degree.\n# Career education \u2013 The traditional two-year student that will graduate with an associate degree and directly enter the workforce.\n# Developmental \u2013 Remedial education for high school graduates who are not academically ready to enroll in college-level courses.\n# Continuing \u2013 Non-Credit courses offered to the community for personal development and interest.\n# Industry training \u2013 Contracted training and education wherein a local company pays the college to provide specific training or courses for their employees.\n# eLearning \u2013 Distance learning occurs online using one's computer and proctored exams. Pell grants and federal aid apply to eLearning also. For example, studying Spanish in an eLearning environment is possible when a student is in another state and federal aid is applied to out-of-state tuition.\n\nWithin the transfer education category, comprehensive schools typically have [[Articulation (education)|articulation]] agreements in place that provide prearranged acceptance into specific four-year institutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Associate Degree for Transfer|url=http://californiacommunitycolleges.cccco.edu/Students/AssociateDegreeforTransfer.aspx|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref> At some community colleges, the partnering four-year institution teaches the third and fourth year courses at the community college location and thereby allows a student to obtain a four-year degree without having to physically move to the four-year school.\n\nThere are institutions and organizations which provide community college research to inform practice and policy.\n\nFor background on U.S. community college libraries, see \"Disposed to Consolidation and Innovation: Criteria for the Community College Specialization.\"<ref>Kathleen M. Heim, \"Disposed to Consolidation and Innovation: Criteria for the Community College Specialization.\" ''Community and Junior College Libraries'' 3 (Summer 1985): 5\u201315.</ref>\n\n== Remediation ==\n\nRemediation, or sometimes referred to as developmental education, is a format of education aimed to help open doors for students by reinforcing or re-teaching them core skills. This educational strategy is utilized so students can meet competencies in various academic arenas and further progress in their academics. Remediation is prominent in community colleges, a type of two-year colleges, as these institutions are designed to accommodate students of various levels of academic abilities. Community college students are placed into remedial coursework according to their performance on placement-based testing they take prior to beginning classes.\n\n=== Assignment ===\n\nThe push in shifting students to enroll in remedial courses at community colleges stems from philosophical beliefs and reputations that these are the most appropriate places for instruction.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Tinto|first1=Vincent|title=Learning communities and the reconstruction of remedial education in higher education|journal=Paper Presented at the Conference of Replacing Remediation in Higher Education at Stanford University|url=https://vtinto.expressions.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Developmental-Education-Learning-Communities.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last1=Bettinger|first1=Eric|last2=Long|first2=Bridget|title=Remediation at the community college: Student participation and outcomes|journal=New Directions for Community Colleges|date=2005|volume=129}}</ref> All community colleges have developmental or remedial courses of some kind.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=McMillan|first1=Virginia|last2=Parke|first2=Scott|last3=Lanning|first3=Carol|title=Remedial/developmental education approaches for the current community college environment|journal=New Directions for Community Colleges|date=1997|volume=100}}</ref> Around 42 percent of first-year students attending two-year colleges in the United States sign up for remedial courses, twice as many as those at four-year universities or colleges.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last1=Callahan|first1=M.

However, the term \"junior college\" is now usually used to characterize private two-year institutions. The term \"community college\" has evolved to describe publicly funded two-year institutions. The main national advocacy organization for community colleges, which was founded in 1920 as the \"American Association of Junior Colleges,\" changed its name in 1992 to the \"[[American Association of Community Colleges]]\".<ref>{{cite web|title=About AACC: Who We Are|url=http://www.aacc.nche.edu/About/Who/Pages/default.aspx|website=American Association of Community Colleges|accessdate=12 February 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211170321/http://www.aacc.nche.edu/About/Who/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=11 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:UCC Gymnasium.jpg|thumb|right|A gymnasium at [[Union County College]] in Cranford, New Jersey.]]\n[[File:6.15.11HudsonCountyCommunityCollegeNorthCampusByLuigiNovi2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Building.|[[Hudson County Community College]] in Union City, NJ.]]\n\nCohen and  Brawer  noted other names: city college, county college (in New Jersey), and branch campus.  Other common components of the school  name include  vocational, technical, [[adult education]] and technical institute.  Nicknames include \"democracy's college\" and \"opportunity college.\"  <ref>Arthur M. Cohen and Florence B. Brawer, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vVbn9X6Wx6YC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false The American Community College]'' (4th ed. 2003) p 4</ref>\n\nIn several Californian cities and in other large cities such as [[Chicago]], with its [[City Colleges of Chicago]], community colleges are often called \"city colleges\", since they are municipally funded and designed to serve the needs of the residents of the city in which they are situated.  Also, the state's public two-year colleges are not solely found in its larger cities.\n\nNew York City's network of community colleges was established outside of the CUNY system, and integrated into that system at the insistence of the state government. Another example is [[Westchester Community College]]. In the late 1940s, the county operated a popular vocational institute. The New York state government required that the county transform its technical institute into a community college. The county government resisted this transformation, as it would be responsible for a third of the new institution's operating costs (in contrast, the state paid for all of the technical institute's operating costs). After a series of very heated meetings, fully reported in the local press, the county was forced to conform to the state government's wishes.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe origins, purposes, and funding of public two-year colleges varies widely among the states and, as in California, within states. Because the role played by rural community colleges in preparing excess rural youth for productive careers in urban centers is not well understood by policy makers, these smaller institutions do not receive sufficient state funding to offset their weak tax bases and, because of their relatively small size, much higher per-student costs when compared to urban community colleges. This inequity in basic institutional funding has led to the creation of such organizations as the [[Community Colleges of Appalachia]] and the tribal college association, which have sought to promote more equitable funding irrespective of an institution's size or location.{{dubious|date=November 2019}}\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early community colleges===\nBefore 1850, a few public institutions offered two years of college: [[Lasell Junior College]] in Auburndale, Massachusetts, and [[Vincennes University]] of Vincennes, Indiana. Helland cites a section from the 1899 Vincennes University catalog: \u201cThe Vincennes University occupies a unique position in the educational field. It is half-way between the commissioned high school and the full-fledged college: it is in fact a junior college.\u201d<ref>Phillip C. Helland, ''Establishment of Public Junior and Community Colleges in Minnesota 1914\u20131983,'' (Saint Paul, MN: Minnesota Community College System, 1987), p. 1.</ref>\n\nMany early community colleges were [[normal school]]s that prepared school teachers. Primary emphasis was placed on traditional middle class values and developing responsible citizens. As an example, Normal Schools began in the State of Massachusetts in the 1880s as extensions of local high schools. They were originated to meet the need for teacher preparation. In Saint Joseph, Missouri, a Normal School was added to the local high school to provide a career track for women who wanted to teach. Mr. Whiteford, the area's district superintendent, inquired of the [[University of Missouri]] to determine if credits from Saint Joseph Normal School could transfer into a baccalaureate program. The University's President Dr. Hill acknowledged the request and provided for the articulation. Coincidentally, Dr. Hill was actively involved in the American Association of Universities and calling for the establishment of junior colleges for this purpose.\n\nIn Minnesota, St. Paul's Public School District established a \u201cCity Training School\u201d for preparing teachers.<ref>B. F. Wright, \u201cAnnual Report of the Superintendent,\u201d Annual Report of the Board of Education. Saint Paul, MN: Globe Office. June 1883, 76\u201378.</ref>  The 1883 school's mission was to provide certified teachers and substitutes for the district. Mrs. M. E. Jenness from the Normal School at River Falls, Wisconsin, was the St. Paul School's first principal; Mrs. N. F. Wheaton was the Director of Practice. Wheaton had been employed at the Oshkosh Normal School in Wisconsin. In Minneapolis, a Normal Training School was instituted in the fall of 1887. Miss Adele Evers of Manchester Normal School in New Hampshire was appointed the first teacher; she was one of six candidates for the position.  Evers\u2019 references included work at Martha's Vineyard and Saratoga.<ref>John E.

Dooley, Industrial Education, (Cambridge: Riverside Press, 1919)</ref>  The Maryland institution was unique as a stand-alone campus. Other examples of sub-baccalaureate programs were the University Preparatory School and Junior College of Tonkawa. The result of the two- year schools founded in Oklahoma Public School Secondary System in 1902, both institutions later merged in 1914 and became the [[Oklahoma Institute of Technology]]. Dean Schneider of the [[University of Cincinnati]] developed an alternative high school with a cooperative plan where students spent one week in an occupation and the other in school. Industry provided the shop experiences and the classroom facilitated the academic.<ref>Charles A. Prosser and Charles A. Allen. Vocational Education in a Democracy. (New York: The Century Co., 1925), 225</ref>  There were also non-cooperative high schools; two examples were the Girl's Vocational High School in Kansas City, Missouri and the Delgado Trade School in New Orleans. A two-year, terminal education, was seen as more socially efficient for students who could advance past high school but not continue to attain bachelor's degrees. This national vocational movement gave junior colleges a target population, but numerous students wanted more than a semiprofessional education; many maintained a desire to transfer. Throughout this time period, there was a move for more public two-year institutions along with a trend to separate from high schools and affiliate with higher education. With the change in affiliation came a new status which encouraged junior colleges to develop additional credibility through the creation of professional criteria and use of scientific methods.\n\nBrint and Karabel conclude that \u201cThe two-year college has been a distinctively American creation, and nowhere else has it attained such prominence.\u201d<ref>Stephen Brint and Jerome Karabel, ''The Diverted Dream: Community Colleges and the Promise of Educational Opportunity in America, 1900\u20131985'' (Oxford University Press, 1989), p 19.</ref>  J. L. Ratcliff.<ref>James L. Ratcliff \u201cSeven Streams in the Historical Development of the Modern American Community College\u201d in ''A Handbook Of The Community College In America'' Ed. George A. Baker III (1994)</ref> suggests one perspective for the emergence of two-year post secondary institutions of the past century: they began in the private sector after the [[Panic of 1893]]. At that time of severe financial hardship J. M. Carroll, president of Baylor University, made a pragmatic suggestion to solve the problem of too many Baptist colleges with insufficient funds and not enough students to support them: reduce the smaller Baptist colleges\u2019 curriculum to the freshman and sophomore years. After this preliminary period, [[Baylor University]] accepted the two-year students and provided the junior and senior years of their academic plan. Carroll hoped this split would require fewer faculty and resources for the first two years of higher education.\n\nIn the larger cities early public community colleges were often an extension of [[high school]]s, like the first established, [[Joliet Junior College]], in Illinois in 1901. These initial community colleges generally were small (usually fewer than 200 students) and focused on a liberal arts education with the goal of [[college transfer|transferring]] students to four-year colleges. They reflected high school needs and lacked a definite identity. These examples of two-year structure innovations with transfer missions in the private and public sector provided a pragmatic approach for the preservation of existing institutions.\n\nJunior colleges grew in number from 20 in 1909 to 170 in 1919. By 1922, 37 states had set up 70 junior colleges, enrolling about 150 students each.  Meanwhile, another 137 were privately operated, with about 60 students each. Rapid expansion continued in the 1920s, with 440 junior colleges in 1930 enrolling about 70,000 students.  The peak year for private institutions came in 1949, when there were 322 junior colleges; 180 were affiliated with churches, 108 were independent non-profit, and 34 were private Schools run for-profit.<ref>Cohen and Brawer, ''The American Community College'' (4th ed. 2003) p 13-14</ref>\n\nMany factors contributed to rapid growth of community colleges. Students parents and businessmen wanted nearby, low-cost schools to provide training for the growing white collar labor force and for more advanced technical blue collar jobs. Four-year colleges were also growing, but not as fast; however many were located in rural or small-town areas away from the fast-growing metropolis.\n\nSeveral different movements supported the creation of community colleges, including local community support of public and private two-year institutions, the expansion of the public education system, increased professional standards for teachers, the vocational education movement, and an expanding demand for adult and community education. Numerous colleges and universities advocated for the development of junior colleges. Leadership felt small, private liberal arts colleges and high schools could provide the first two years of college while larger universities could focus resources on research and junior and senior level students.\n\n===Depression era===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s there was a shift in the purpose of community colleges to developing a workforce, which was influenced by wide unemployment during the [[Great Depression]]. Developing \"semiprofessionals\" became dominant national language to describe junior college students. The notion that engineers and supervisors make primary decisions about what and how activities were to be done in the workplace provided the origins for employees needed to carry out their decisions. This need for a class of workers to implement the decisions of the theoreticians demanded an educational delivery system other than the traditional four-year college or university. The closed shop of the artisan which had initially provided workers was no longer the educational program of choice. Nationally, a new two-year vehicle for educating the industrial worker found its launching within the secondary public school system under the leadership of local school districts.\n\n===Cold War era===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nAfter [[World War II]], the [[G.I. Bill]] afforded more educational opportunity to veterans which resulted in increased enrollments. Another factor that led to growth was the rise of adult and community education. After World War II, community colleges were seen as a good place to house continuing education programs. The 1947 [[President's Commission on Higher Education]] was an important national document for community colleges. It established a network of public community colleges that would provide education to a diverse group of students at little or no cost along with serving community needs through a comprehensive mission.\n\nThis national network exploded in the 1960s with 457 community colleges and the enrollment of [[baby boomer]]s. A series of grants through the Kellogg Junior College Leadership Programs helped train many community college leaders during this decade.\n\n[[Merritt College]], a junior college (and now a community college) in Oakland, California, was the site for organizing and educating members of the [[Black Panthers]] in the mid- to late-1960s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CKFlirjb2EAC&pg=PP1&dq=merritt+college+black+panthers#v=onepage&q=merritt%20college%20black%20panthers&f=false|title=Black Against Empire|work=google.com|isbn=9780520271852|last1=Bloom|first1=Joshua|author2=Waldo E Martin JR|last3=Martin|first3=Waldo E.|date=2013-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/facpub/479/|title=\"The Black Panther Party's Narratives of Resistance\" by David Ray Papke|work=marquette.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jsh/summary/v042/42.1.rogers.html|title=Project MUSE \u2013 The Marginalization of the Black Campus Movement|work=jhu.edu}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, growth continued when many enrolled to escape the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam era draft]]. The 1970s also marked a shift to faculty development, including more instructional training for the unique student body and mission of community colleges. In 1976, Coastline Community College was launched as the first \"college without walls,\" using television, a precursor today's online programs as well as using community facilities. During the 1980s, community colleges began to work more closely with high schools to prepare students for vocational and technical two-year programs.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, two-year community colleges were playing important roles in higher education as access mechanisms. They became an integral feature for those persons who were attending higher education for the first time or as non-traditional students. Brint and Karabel<ref>Stephen Brint and Jerome Karabel, The Diverted Dream: Community Colleges and the Promise of Educational Opportunity in America, 1900\u20131985.</ref>  have recognized the change that transpired from 1920 when fewer than 2 percent of all college freshmen were enrolled in a two-year college to the late 1980s when over 50 percent were matriculated. Junior colleges once located in high schools had left their origins to develop their own campuses and were called community colleges and still retained the transfer access mission. High school normal schools matured into teacher colleges or colleges of education within universities offering bachelor and graduate degrees. Industrial institutes integrated with local junior colleges to make these campus's programs more comprehensive community colleges. Along with this growth and legitimization of two-year mechanisms for the delivery of higher education, the emergence of two-year institutions provided an epistemological debate that divided the river of education flowing into the early 20th century into three streams of educational natures. \u201cIn the process of this struggle and adjustment some colleges will grow stronger, some will become academies, some junior colleges; the high schools will be elevated to a still more important position than that which they now occupy. The general result will be the growth of a system in the higher educational work of the United States, where now no system exists.\u201d<ref>William Rainey Harper, The Prospects of the Small College. (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1900), 45\u201346.</ref>\n\n===1990s and 2000s===\nIn recent history, a debate between the advocates and critics of community colleges gained strength. Advocates argued that community colleges served the needs of society by providing college opportunity to students who [[Post Secondary Transition For High School Students with Disabilities|otherwise cannot go to college]], training and retraining mid-level [[skilled worker]]s, and preserving the academic excellence of four-year universities. Critics argued that community colleges continued a culture of privilege through training business workers at public expense, not allowing the working class to advance in social class, protecting selective admissions at four-year institutions for the nation's elite, and discouraging transfer through [[cooling out]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Clark |first=Burton R. |year=1960 |title=The \"cooling-out\" function in higher education |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=569\u2013575 |doi=10.1086/222787 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the growth of community colleges has stabilized, enrollment continued to outgrow four-year institutions.

According to the Education Commission of the States there are three major types of higher education governance systems in the states; they are Governing Board States, Coordinating Board States and Planning/ Regulatory/Service Agency States. (from: [http://www.ecs.org The Education Commission of the States website])\n\n'''Governing board states (GBS)'''\n\nState-level governing boards are distinguished according to whether they are responsible for consolidated systems or multi-campus systems. Consolidated systems are composed of several previously independently governed institutions that were later consolidated into one system. Multi-campus systems developed primarily through extensions of various branches or campuses.\n\n'''Coordinating board states'''\n\nCoordinating boards vary significantly in formal authority and informal power and influence from state to state.  Generally, there is a state level board governing universities, colleges, and community colleges.  Each university and community college district will have its own board that is accountable to a state-coordinating agency.\n\n'''The Planning/Regulatory/Service Agency States (PRSA)'''\n\nThe PRSA states have limited or non-existent formal governing or coordinating authority, which carry out regulatory and service functions such as student financial aid.\n\nFor a comprehensive list of American community colleges and their state level governing boards:  ''[http://www.utexas.edu/world/comcol/state U.S. Community Colleges by State, University of Texas at Austin]''\n\nA more thorough description of state level college and university governance models can be found at: ''Models of Postsecondary Education Coordination and Governance in the States''\n\n<big>'''Local governance'''</big>\n\nMost community colleges are operated within special districts that draw property tax revenue from the local community, as a division of a state university, or as a sister institution within a statewide higher education system.\n\nIn all cases, community colleges are governed by a board of trustees, appointed by the state governor, or the board is elected by citizens residing within the community college district. In some instances, as with the City Colleges of Chicago, the board of trustees is appointed by the presiding local government.  In Chicago, it is the mayor who appoints the board.\n\nDepending on the operational system, the board of trustees may directly govern the college or may govern the college through a university or system-level office. Depending upon the locus of control, the board may or may not be subject to control by a state agency that supervises all community college districts or all higher education institutions within the state.\n\nThe board of trustees selects a president or chancellor of the community college to serve as the chief executive officer and lead the faculty and staff.\n\n<big>'''Multi-college district'''</big>\n\nMulti-college community college districts include several individually accredited community colleges within one district.  Each college is independent with distinct local administration, but they share a single board of trustees and report to a non-instructional central administrative office.\n\nThe Contra Costa Community College District is an example of one of the largest multi-college community college districts in California. The District consists of Contra Costa College, Diablo Valley College, Los Medanos College, San Ramon Campus, and Brentwood Center, and annually serves almost 62,000 students.\n\n<big>'''Multi-campus district'''</big>\n\nLarger schools implement a multi-campus system and generally share a single accreditation.  Local administrative governance varies. Extension campuses report to the main campus administration or a central administrative office.  A good example of this is [[College of DuPage]] in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, which has 6 satellite campuses within a 10-mile area, in addition to its main campus, which itself has 9 structures and an enrollment of over 30,000 students.\n\n<big>'''Faculty governance'''</big>\n\n'''Faculty senates and councils'''\n\nA faculty senate, or faculty council as this body is sometimes referred to, is the representative body of all faculty who participate in the governance processes of the community college. As with all governing bodies, the faculty senate is usually governed by a constitution and a set of bylaws specific to the college.  Membership in this body varies from college, with most restricting voting rights to tenured and tenure track faculty, and others allowing a wider array of members to include full-time, adjunct, continuing education, technical, and adult basic education faculty. (modified from: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110727185727/http://www.pima.edu/facsenate/ Pima Community College : Faculty Senate])\n\nThough this is not an exhaustive list, the mission of the faculty senate at the community college usually includes: matters concerning curricular decisions; strengthening the concept of the faculty as a college entity; promoting the gathering, exchanging, and disseminating of faculty views and concerns regarding college matters; promoting mutual accountability between the college faculty and the faculty representative to any college committee; advising the Chancellor and other administrators of faculty views on college matters; bringing the concerns of the Chancellor and other administrators on college matters to the faculty; promoting the involvement of all faculty members in the establishing, staffing, and functioning of college committees, task forces, or other initiatives; and participating in the policy review process of the college.\n\n<big>'''Collective bargaining units/agreements'''</big>\n\nMost community college faculty are bargained for employees.  While unions and their respective collective bargaining agreements serve to protect faculty rights and working conditions, collective bargaining agreements, or union contracts, provide faculty with a defined set of rules and regulations they must follow as a condition of employment.\nCollective bargaining swept into higher education on the coattails of legislation authorizing public employees to negotiate. As these laws were passed in various states in the 1960s and 1970s, employee groups ranging from refuse collectors to prison guards gained union representation and began negotiating contracts (Cohen & Brawer, 2008, p.&nbsp;147)\n\nCollective bargaining units exist for all divisions of community college faculty; however, participation by faculty groups differs from college to college.\n\n<big>'''Student governance'''</big>\n\nThere is a student government organizational presence on close to every community college campus in America The Student Government organization is the official voice of the student body, a vital link in effective student participation in all areas of student concern in relationship to the college's administration. By advocating student rights and services, the organization represents the student body and presents its concerns to the college administration, local, and national issues.  Through the Student Government organizations the college provides students with essential leadership experience, and valuable connections with faculty, staff administration, students, and the Board of Trustees.  Student involvement is usually based on criteria set by the institution; all students have the right as a student to participate in democratic process on campus.

Colleges are very special types of institutions with a unique mission\u2014the creation and dissemination of ideas. At the heart of shared governance is the belief that decision-making should be largely independent of short-term managerial and political considerations.  Faculty and professional staff are in the best position to shape and implement curriculum and research policy, to select academic colleagues and judge their work; and The perspective of all front-line personnel is invaluable in making sound decisions about allocating resources, setting goals, choosing top officers and guiding student life.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of governance at the community college, please see the AAUP's 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities and the 1998 statement on the same topic by the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges.  These documents more clearly define those matters that are the responsibility of the voting faculty and those reserved to the governing body and its delegates.

That is, anyone with a [[high school diploma]] or [[General Educational Development|GED]] may attend, regardless of academic status or [[college entrance exam]] scores. Students however do take [[placement testing|placement tests]] before enrolling, because not all courses are open admission. In California and Minnesota, students reaching age 18 are not required to have completed secondary education, but they must show an \"[[ability to benefit]]\" from a college's educational program. Under certain circumstances, community colleges also accept high school students or dropouts.\n\nThe open admission policy results in a wide range of students attending community college classes. Students range in age from teenagers in [[high school]] taking classes under a concurrent, or dual, enrollment policy (which allows both high school and college credits to be earned simultaneously) to working adults taking classes at night to complete a degree or gain additional skills in their field to students with graduate degrees who enroll to become more employable or to pursue lifelong interests. \"Reverse transfers\" (or those transferring from a university) constitute one of the fastest growing new community college cohorts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nOne threat to enrollment at community colleges has been the increasing popularity of for-profit e-learning and online universities. Many community colleges have supplemented their offerings with online courses to stave off competition from exclusively e-learning schools. For example, [[Northern Virginia Community College]]'s Extended Learning Institute<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eli.nvcc.edu|title=Extended Learning Institute :: Northern Virginia Community College|author=Northern Virginia Community College|work=nvcc.edu}}</ref> has been offering distance learning courses for thirty-five years.

The majority of programs are offered on campus, however, distance and online educational opportunities have become increasingly common. Virtually all community colleges now offer courses and programs online.\n\n===Remedial education===\nAccording to the [[Center for Community College Student Engagement]], 68 percent of community college students require remedial coursework.<ref>https://www.ccsse.org/docs/underprepared_student.pdf</ref>\n\n===Associate degree===\nIn study towards an [[associate degree]], a student takes necessary courses needed to earn a degree that will allow for entry into jobs requiring some level of college education but not a full four-year degree. The associate degree program also allows students who wish to eventually obtain a [[bachelor's degree]] at a four-year college to complete the necessary \"core\" requirements to attend the college of their choice. Some states have mandated that the community college's curriculum be structured so as to satisfy \"core curriculum\" requirements at the state's public universities or private universities.\n\nMany community colleges have [[Articulation (education)|articulation]] arrangements with nearby four-year institutions, where a student obtaining an associate degree in a field will automatically have his/her classes counted toward the bachelor's degree requirement. For example, a community college associate degree in hotel and restaurant management, computers or accounting would count toward the four-year school's core requirement for a Business Administration degree. Some have gone one step further by arrangements with a four-year college for the student to obtain the bachelor's degree from the four-year college while taking all the courses via [[distance learning]] or other non-traditional modes, thus reducing the number of physical visits to the four-year school. One such example is [[College of DuPage]] (COD) in Illinois, who have implemented a program called 3+1. In this program, students can take three years of classes at the community college taught by COD professors and faculty, and in the fourth year attend classes on the COD campus, but taught by professors of nearby partner universities, such as [[Benedictine University]], [[Concordia University]], [[Governors State University]], [[Lewis University]], and [[Roosevelt University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cod.edu/academics/transfer_programs/3plus1.aspx|title=College of DuPage \u2013 3+1 Degree Programs \u2013 Earn Your Bachelor's Degree|work=cod.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Certification===\nCertification in an area of [[training]] (such as [[Licensed Practical Nurse|nursing]], [[computer repair]], [[allied health]], [[Police|law enforcement]], [[firefighting]], or [[welding]]), which require preparation for a state or national examination, or where certification would allow for hiring preference or a higher salary upon entering the workforce. These courses are often geared toward the needs of the local or area business community.\n\n===Local services===\nServices of local interest to members of the community, such as job placement, adult continuing education classes (either for personal achievement or to maintain certification in specialized fields), and developmental classes for children. Some community colleges offer opportunities for high school dropouts to return to school and earn a high school diploma or obtain a GED.\n\n=== Bachelor's degrees ===\n\nA growing trend in the United States is for community colleges to begin offering bachelor's degrees. As of 2013, nineteen states have authorized their community colleges to offer bachelor's degrees with California passing authorizing legislation in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accbd.org/resources/baccalaureate-conferring-locations/?ct=US|title=Baccalaureate Conferring Locations|author=|publisher=Community College Baccalaureate Association|date=October 2013|accessdate=2015-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/29/the-10-000-community-college-ba|title=The $10,000 Community College B.A.: California is the latest state to allow community colleges to offer select bachelor's degree programs.|author= Allie Bidwell|magazine=U.S. News & World Report|date=2014-09-29|accessdate=2015-01-23}}</ref>\n\nMany large community colleges, such as [[Miami-Dade College]] and [[St. Petersburg College]], in [[Florida]] have even completely dropped the words \"community\" or \"junior\" from their names as they have added bachelor's degree programs in limited fields and have started their evolution into four-year colleges while retaining their local commitments. Even some smaller community colleges, such as [[Northern New Mexico College]] in [[Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico]], have dropped community from their names and now offer six or more bachelor's degrees.<ref>[http://www.nnmc.edu/about/BaccalaureatePrograms.shtml]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509161917/http://www.nnmc.edu/about/BaccalaureatePrograms.shtml|date=May 9, 2008}}</ref> A few of the larger institutions, such as [[De Anza College]] in northern California and [[College of DuPage]] near Chicago, who both boast enrollment of over 25,000 students, continue to explore the [[cost-benefit analysis]] in offering 4-year degrees.  In more rural communities, community colleges may host branches of the local state university, and community colleges with specialized programs may offer four-year degrees in conjunction with other schools, some miles away. For instance, [[Southern Illinois University]] offers aviation management bachelor's degrees at [[Mt. San Antonio College]] and [[Palomar College]] in Southern California.\n\n== Advantages of community colleges ==\n* Community colleges emphasize the needs of local students and the local job market. Students who could not afford campus or off-site housing at a four-year college, or for other reasons cannot relocate, can attend courses while staying in their local community (though some colleges do offer student housing). They can even benefit university graduates, since some four-year schools fail to prepare their graduates for the kinds of jobs that are available in their surrounding regions.

In comparison, a large university college course may be taught to 300+ students by a teaching assistant, while the professor attends to research duties {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}. Outside of those teaching in the technical and vocational fields, most instructors at community colleges have [[master's degree]]s and many hold [[Doctorate|doctoral]] degrees. In addition, community college professors can help students achieve their goals, work more closely with them, and offer them support, while at four-year colleges and universities, a professor is also often expected to conduct academic research, and in some cases, to mentor [[graduate students]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Agrawal|first=Chad|title=Community College Transfer|url=http://www.communitycollegetransferstudents.com|work=Community College Transfer Students|accessdate=September 12, 2011}}</ref>\n* A number of community colleges have athletic programs; certain colleges also serve as incubators for college athletes, particularly in [[baseball]], [[basketball]] and [[college football|football]].

This is especially important for students that have to work, or have family obligations, while they are pursuing a degree. For those students that have to work or want to ease their way into the world of higher education, community college allows them to move at their own pace.\n*Contrary to popular belief, federal and private financial aid is also available to community college students. Federal student loans require students to only be enrolled half time \u2013 usually six credit hours or two college courses. In order for community college students to keep their financial aid, they just need to make sure they do not drop out of school. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/community-colleges/slideshows/10-reasons-to-attend-a-community-college|title=10 Reasons to Attend a Community College|last=Mitchell|first=Travis|date=July 10, 2019|website=U.S. News|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Private loans are also beginning to become options for community college students. Private lenders are also beginning to offer loans for students attending two-year colleges and technical schools.\n*The science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, otherwise known as STEM, field is growing at a fast pace.

However, many four-year colleges (usually near the community college) have made arrangements, known as articulation agreements, allowing associate degrees to qualify for transfer, some cases allowing the student to complete the bachelor's degree via [[distance learning]] from the community college campus. Some states have passed rules whereby certain associate degrees in a field will automatically transfer to state universities as the core curriculum for specified bachelor's degrees.  [[Minnesota]], Alabama, and Oregon have created a statewide \"transfer curriculum\" allowing credits to be transferred to any other public university and almost all of the private colleges. The North Carolina system has a similar agreement, whereby specific courses are designated for mandatory transfer credit to all statewide public four-year institutions. Illinois's [http://www.itransfer.org/ I-transfer program] program aids students in transferring credits across the state. California has a system known as Assist,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assist.org/|title=Welcome to ASSIST|work=assist.org}}</ref> which labels course equivalencies between all California Community Colleges and California public four-year colleges. Texas has a similar system known as [http://www.tccns.org/ TCCN] for labelling course equivalencies between all Texas Community Colleges and Texas public four-year institutions. \n* It is frequent for many courses to be taught by part-time [[lecturer]]s, [[Adjunct professors|adjuncts]], or [[contingent labor]], some with only a bachelor's degree in the field. Research conducted by the University of Washington's Labor Center suggests that community colleges' reliance on part-time (adjunct) faculty results in lower graduation rates than colleges with a full-time workforce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidehighered.com/news/2006/10/16/parttime|title=Adjuncts and Graduation Rates|work=insidehighered.com}}</ref> \n*According to federal statistics, 42% of public community college freshmen take remedial courses, and further studies show that 79% of remedial courses are taught by part-time faculty.<ref name=NYT-Merrow3-042207>John Merrow, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/education/edlife/22merrow-profile-3.html Community Colleges: A Harsh Reality], ''The New York Times'', April 22, 2007.</ref>\n* Individuals with associate degrees usually earn less than those with bachelor's degrees.<ref>See [[Personal income in the United States]] \u2013 chart on income by educational attainment.</ref>\n* While community colleges are open enrollment institutions, meaning they accept and enroll all prospective students as long as fees are paid and the student enrolls in classes, this open door policy is often seen as a revolving door, with many students, nearly 2/3 not completing their education.<ref>Boggs, G.

These schools typically offer six facets of education: \n# Transfer education \u2013 The traditional two-year student who will then transfer to a four-year institution to pursue a BS/BA degree.\n# Career education \u2013 The traditional two-year student that will graduate with an associate degree and directly enter the workforce.\n# Developmental \u2013 Remedial education for high school graduates who are not academically ready to enroll in college-level courses.\n# Continuing \u2013 Non-Credit courses offered to the community for personal development and interest.\n# Industry training \u2013 Contracted training and education wherein a local company pays the college to provide specific training or courses for their employees.\n# eLearning \u2013 Distance learning occurs online using one's computer and proctored exams. Pell grants and federal aid apply to eLearning also. For example, studying Spanish in an eLearning environment is possible when a student is in another state and federal aid is applied to out-of-state tuition.\n\nWithin the transfer education category, comprehensive schools typically have [[Articulation (education)|articulation]] agreements in place that provide prearranged acceptance into specific four-year institutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Associate Degree for Transfer|url=http://californiacommunitycolleges.cccco.edu/Students/AssociateDegreeforTransfer.aspx|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref> At some community colleges, the partnering four-year institution teaches the third and fourth year courses at the community college location and thereby allows a student to obtain a four-year degree without having to physically move to the four-year school.\n\nThere are institutions and organizations which provide community college research to inform practice and policy.\n\nFor background on U.S. community college libraries, see \"Disposed to Consolidation and Innovation: Criteria for the Community College Specialization.\"<ref>Kathleen M.

This educational strategy is utilized so students can meet competencies in various academic arenas and further progress in their academics. Remediation is prominent in community colleges, a type of two-year colleges, as these institutions are designed to accommodate students of various levels of academic abilities. Community college students are placed into remedial coursework according to their performance on placement-based testing they take prior to beginning classes.\n\n=== Assignment ===\n\nThe push in shifting students to enroll in remedial courses at community colleges stems from philosophical beliefs and reputations that these are the most appropriate places for instruction.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Tinto|first1=Vincent|title=Learning communities and the reconstruction of remedial education in higher education|journal=Paper Presented at the Conference of Replacing Remediation in Higher Education at Stanford University|url=https://vtinto.expressions.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Developmental-Education-Learning-Communities.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last1=Bettinger|first1=Eric|last2=Long|first2=Bridget|title=Remediation at the community college: Student participation and outcomes|journal=New Directions for Community Colleges|date=2005|volume=129}}</ref> All community colleges have developmental or remedial courses of some kind.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=McMillan|first1=Virginia|last2=Parke|first2=Scott|last3=Lanning|first3=Carol|title=Remedial/developmental education approaches for the current community college environment|journal=New Directions for Community Colleges|date=1997|volume=100}}</ref> Around 42 percent of first-year students attending two-year colleges in the United States sign up for remedial courses, twice as many as those at four-year universities or colleges.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last1=Callahan|first1=M.

It is likely that \u0394FosB research will now progress into a new era \u2013 the use of \u0394FosB as a biomarker.&nbsp;...<br />Conclusions<br />\u0394FosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of \u0394FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for \u0394FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of \u0394FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of \u0394FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ''molecular switch'' (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of \u0394FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}</ref><ref name=\"G9a reverses \u0394FosB plasticity\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bili\u0144ski P, Wojty\u0142a A, Kapka-Skrzypczak L, Chwedorowicz R, Cyranka M, Studzi\u0144ski T | title = Epigenetic regulation in drug addiction | journal = Ann.

EFs and prefrontal cortex are the first to suffer, and suffer disproportionately, if something is not right in your life. They suffer first, and most, if you are stressed (Arnsten 1998, Liston et al. 2009, Oaten & Cheng 2005), sad (Hirt et al. 2008, von Hecker & Meiser 2005), lonely (Baumeister et al. 2002, Cacioppo & Patrick 2008, Campbell et al. 2006, Tun et al. 2012), sleep deprived (Barnes et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2007), or not physically fit (Best 2010, Chaddock et al. 2011, Hillman et al. 2008). Any of these can cause you to appear to have a disorder of EFs, such as ADHD, when you do not. You can see the deleterious effects of stress, sadness, loneliness, and lack of physical health or fitness at the physiological and neuroanatomical level in prefrontal cortex and at the behavioral level in worse EFs (poorer reasoning and problem solving, forgetting things, and impaired ability to exercise discipline and self-control).&nbsp;...<br />EFs can be improved (Diamond & Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).&nbsp;... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson & Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011)&nbsp;... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one's attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what's more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we would be at the mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn\u2019t make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice.&nbsp;...

The prefrontal cortex receives inputs not only from other cortical regions, including association cortex, but also, via the thalamus, inputs from subcortical structures subserving emotion and motivation, such as the amygdala (Chapter 14) and ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens; Chapter 15).&nbsp;...<br />In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.&nbsp;... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior.

Pitchers and colleagues (2010) reported that sexual experience was shown to cause DeltaFosB accumulation in several limbic brain regions including the NAc, medial pre-frontal cortex, VTA, caudate, and putamen, but not the medial preoptic nucleus. Next, the induction of c-Fos, a downstream (repressed) target of DeltaFosB, was measured in sexually experienced and naive animals. The number of mating-induced c-Fos-IR cells was significantly decreased in sexually experienced animals compared to sexually naive controls. Finally, DeltaFosB levels and its activity in the NAc were manipulated using viral-mediated gene transfer to study its potential role in mediating sexual experience and experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance. Animals with DeltaFosB overexpression displayed enhanced facilitation of sexual performance with sexual experience relative to controls. In contrast, the expression of DeltaJunD, a dominant-negative binding partner of DeltaFosB, attenuated sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance, and stunted long-term maintenance of facilitation compared to DeltaFosB overexpressing group.

Cross-sensitization is also bidirectional, as a history of amphetamine administration facilitates sexual behavior and enhances the associated increase in NAc DA&nbsp;... As described for food reward, sexual experience can also lead to activation of plasticity-related signaling cascades. The transcription factor delta FosB is increased in the NAc, PFC, dorsal striatum, and VTA following repeated sexual behavior (Wallace et al., 2008; Pitchers et al., 2010b). This natural increase in delta FosB or viral overexpression of delta FosB within the NAc modulates sexual performance, and NAc blockade of delta FosB attenuates this behavior (Hedges et al, 2009; Pitchers et al., 2010b). Further, viral overexpression of delta FosB enhances the conditioned place preference for an environment paired with sexual experience (Hedges et al., 2009).&nbsp;...

Incentive salience takes Pavlovian learning and memory as one input and as an equally important input takes neurobiological state factors (e.g. drug states, appetite states, satiety states) that can vary independently of learning. Neurobiological state changes can produce unlearned fluctuations or even reversals in the ability of a previously learned reward cue to trigger motivation. Such fluctuations in cue-triggered motivation can dramatically depart from all previously learned values about the associated reward outcome.&nbsp;... Associative learning and prediction are important contributors to motivation for rewards. Learning gives incentive value to arbitrary cues such as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that is associated with a reward (unconditioned stimulus or UCS). Learned cues for reward are often potent triggers of desires. For example, learned cues can trigger normal appetites in everyone, and can sometimes trigger compulsive urges and relapse in addicts.<br />Cue-triggered \u2018wanting\u2019 for the UCS<br />A brief CS encounter (or brief UCS encounter) often primes a pulse of elevated motivation to obtain and consume more reward UCS.

This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (\"wanting\") on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&nbsp;...<br />The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&nbsp;...<br />The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.&nbsp;... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}}</ref><ref name=\"Incentive salience and motivation review\" /><ref name=\"Reinforcement in addiction\" /> Reward sensitization normally occurs following chronically high levels of exposure to the stimulus.

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<br />G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of \u0394FosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while \u0394FosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation. }}</ref><ref name=\"Amphetamine epigenetics\">{{cite journal | vauthors = McCowan TJ, Dhasarathy A, Carvelli L | title = The Epigenetic Mechanisms of Amphetamine | journal = J.

Importantly, some studies have also correlated the epigenetic regulation induced by AMPH with the behavioral outcomes caused by this drug, suggesting therefore that epigenetics remodeling underlies the behavioral changes induced by AMPH.

The effects of pharmacological inhibition of HDACs on psychostimulant-induced plasticity appear to depend on the timecourse of HDAC inhibition. Studies employing co-administration procedures in which inhibitors are given acutely, just prior to psychostimulant administration, report heightened behavioral responses to the drug<sup>1,3,4,13,14</sup>. In contrast, experimental paradigms like the one employed here, in which HDAC inhibitors are administered more chronically, for several days prior to psychostimulant exposure, show inhibited expression<sup>3</sup> or decreased acquisition of behavioral adaptations to drug<sup>5,11,12</sup>. The clustering of seemingly discrepant results based on experimental methodologies is interesting in light of our present findings. Both HDAC inhibitors and psychostimulants increase global levels of histone acetylation in NAc. Thus, when co-administered acutely, these drugs may have synergistic effects, leading to heightened transcriptional activation of psychostimulant-regulated target genes. In contrast, when a psychostimulant is given in the context of prolonged, HDAC inhibitor-induced hyperacetylation, homeostatic processes may direct AcH3 binding to the promoters of genes (e.g., G9a) responsible for inducing chromatin condensation and gene repression (e.g., via H3K9me2) in order to dampen already heightened transcriptional activation.

Decreasing HDAC2 reverses both the molecular and behavioral consequences of alcohol addiction, thus implicating this enzyme as a potential treatment target (Fig. 3). HDAC2 is also crucial for the induction and maintenance of structural synaptic plasticity in other neurological domains such as memory formation [115]. Taken together, these findings underscore the potential usefulness of HDAC inhibition in treating alcohol use disorders&nbsp;... Given the ability of HDAC inhibitors to potently modulate the synaptic plasticity of learning and memory [118], these drugs hold potential as treatment for substance abuse-related disorders.&nbsp;... Our lab and others have published extensively on the ability of HDAC inhibitors to reverse the gene expression deficits caused by multiple models of alcoholism and alcohol abuse, the results of which were discussed above [25,112,113].

Over the past two decades, research has progressed from identifying \u0394FosB induction to investigating its subsequent action (38). It is likely that \u0394FosB research will now progress into a new era \u2013 the use of \u0394FosB as a biomarker.&nbsp;...<br />Conclusions<br />\u0394FosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of \u0394FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for \u0394FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of \u0394FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of \u0394FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ''molecular switch'' (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of \u0394FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}</ref><ref name=\"G9a reverses \u0394FosB plasticity\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bili\u0144ski P, Wojty\u0142a A, Kapka-Skrzypczak L, Chwedorowicz R, Cyranka M, Studzi\u0144ski T | title = Epigenetic regulation in drug addiction | journal = Ann.

In this way, the induction of CDK5 gene expression occurs together with suppression of the G9A gene coding for dimethyltransferase acting on the histone H3. A feedback mechanism can be observed in the regulation of these 2 crucial factors that determine the adaptive epigenetic response to cocaine. This depends on \u0394FosB inhibiting G9a gene expression, i.e. H3K9me2 synthesis which in turn inhibits transcription factors for \u0394FosB. For this reason, the observed hyper-expression of G9a, which ensures high levels of the dimethylated form of histone H3, eliminates the neuronal structural and plasticity effects caused by cocaine by means of this feedback which blocks \u0394FosB transcription}}</ref> \u0394FosB expression in these neurons directly and positively regulates drug [[self-administration]] and [[#Sensitization|reward sensitization]] through [[positive reinforcement]], while decreasing sensitivity to [[wikt:aversion|aversion]].{{#tag:ref|A decrease in aversion sensitivity, in simpler terms, means that an individual's behavior is less likely to be influenced by undesirable outcomes.|group=\"note\"|name=\"\u0394FosB behaviors\"}}<ref name=\"Cellular basis\" /><ref name=\"What the \u0394FosB?\" />\n\nAddiction exacts an \"astoundingly high financial and human toll\" on individuals and society as a whole.<ref name=\"Societal toll\">{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | page = 4 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 1: Basic Principles of Neuropharmacology | quote = Drug abuse and addiction exact an astoundingly high financial and human toll on society through direct adverse effects, such as lung cancer and hepatic cirrhosis, and indirect adverse effects&nbsp;\u2013for example, accidents and AIDS&nbsp;\u2013 on health and productivity.}}</ref><ref name=\"Epidem\">{{cite journal|vauthors = Merikangas KR, McClair VL | title = Epidemiology of Substance Use Disorders | date = June 2012 | journal = Hum.

EFs and prefrontal cortex are the first to suffer, and suffer disproportionately, if something is not right in your life. They suffer first, and most, if you are stressed (Arnsten 1998, Liston et al. 2009, Oaten & Cheng 2005), sad (Hirt et al. 2008, von Hecker & Meiser 2005), lonely (Baumeister et al. 2002, Cacioppo & Patrick 2008, Campbell et al. 2006, Tun et al. 2012), sleep deprived (Barnes et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2007), or not physically fit (Best 2010, Chaddock et al. 2011, Hillman et al. 2008). Any of these can cause you to appear to have a disorder of EFs, such as ADHD, when you do not. You can see the deleterious effects of stress, sadness, loneliness, and lack of physical health or fitness at the physiological and neuroanatomical level in prefrontal cortex and at the behavioral level in worse EFs (poorer reasoning and problem solving, forgetting things, and impaired ability to exercise discipline and self-control).&nbsp;...<br />EFs can be improved (Diamond & Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).&nbsp;... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson & Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011)&nbsp;... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one's attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what's more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we would be at the mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn\u2019t make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice.&nbsp;...

The prefrontal cortex receives inputs not only from other cortical regions, including association cortex, but also, via the thalamus, inputs from subcortical structures subserving emotion and motivation, such as the amygdala (Chapter 14) and ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens; Chapter 15).&nbsp;...<br />In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.&nbsp;... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior.

Pitchers and colleagues (2010) reported that sexual experience was shown to cause DeltaFosB accumulation in several limbic brain regions including the NAc, medial pre-frontal cortex, VTA, caudate, and putamen, but not the medial preoptic nucleus. Next, the induction of c-Fos, a downstream (repressed) target of DeltaFosB, was measured in sexually experienced and naive animals. The number of mating-induced c-Fos-IR cells was significantly decreased in sexually experienced animals compared to sexually naive controls. Finally, DeltaFosB levels and its activity in the NAc were manipulated using viral-mediated gene transfer to study its potential role in mediating sexual experience and experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance. Animals with DeltaFosB overexpression displayed enhanced facilitation of sexual performance with sexual experience relative to controls. In contrast, the expression of DeltaJunD, a dominant-negative binding partner of DeltaFosB, attenuated sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance, and stunted long-term maintenance of facilitation compared to DeltaFosB overexpressing group.

Cross-sensitization is also bidirectional, as a history of amphetamine administration facilitates sexual behavior and enhances the associated increase in NAc DA&nbsp;... As described for food reward, sexual experience can also lead to activation of plasticity-related signaling cascades. The transcription factor delta FosB is increased in the NAc, PFC, dorsal striatum, and VTA following repeated sexual behavior (Wallace et al., 2008; Pitchers et al., 2010b). This natural increase in delta FosB or viral overexpression of delta FosB within the NAc modulates sexual performance, and NAc blockade of delta FosB attenuates this behavior (Hedges et al, 2009; Pitchers et al., 2010b). Further, viral overexpression of delta FosB enhances the conditioned place preference for an environment paired with sexual experience (Hedges et al., 2009).&nbsp;...

Incentive salience takes Pavlovian learning and memory as one input and as an equally important input takes neurobiological state factors (e.g. drug states, appetite states, satiety states) that can vary independently of learning. Neurobiological state changes can produce unlearned fluctuations or even reversals in the ability of a previously learned reward cue to trigger motivation. Such fluctuations in cue-triggered motivation can dramatically depart from all previously learned values about the associated reward outcome.&nbsp;... Associative learning and prediction are important contributors to motivation for rewards. Learning gives incentive value to arbitrary cues such as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that is associated with a reward (unconditioned stimulus or UCS). Learned cues for reward are often potent triggers of desires. For example, learned cues can trigger normal appetites in everyone, and can sometimes trigger compulsive urges and relapse in addicts.<br />Cue-triggered \u2018wanting\u2019 for the UCS<br />A brief CS encounter (or brief UCS encounter) often primes a pulse of elevated motivation to obtain and consume more reward UCS.

This cue attraction is another signature feature of incentive salience&nbsp;... Two recognizable features of incentive salience are often visible that can be used in neuroscience experiments: (i) UCS-directed \u2018wanting\u2019 \u2013 CS-triggered pulses of intensified \u2018wanting\u2019 for the UCS reward; and (ii) CS-directed \u2018wanting\u2019 \u2013 motivated attraction to the Pavlovian cue, which makes the arbitrary CS stimulus into a motivational magnet.}}</ref>|group=\"note\"}}) that is assigned by the brain to a rewarding stimulus (e.g., a drug).

This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (\"wanting\") on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&nbsp;...<br />The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&nbsp;...<br />The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.&nbsp;... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}}</ref><ref name=\"Incentive salience and motivation review\" /><ref name=\"Reinforcement in addiction\" /> Reward sensitization normally occurs following chronically high levels of exposure to the stimulus.

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<br />G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of \u0394FosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while \u0394FosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation. }}</ref><ref name=\"Amphetamine epigenetics\">{{cite journal | vauthors = McCowan TJ, Dhasarathy A, Carvelli L | title = The Epigenetic Mechanisms of Amphetamine | journal = J.

Importantly, some studies have also correlated the epigenetic regulation induced by AMPH with the behavioral outcomes caused by this drug, suggesting therefore that epigenetics remodeling underlies the behavioral changes induced by AMPH.

The effects of pharmacological inhibition of HDACs on psychostimulant-induced plasticity appear to depend on the timecourse of HDAC inhibition. Studies employing co-administration procedures in which inhibitors are given acutely, just prior to psychostimulant administration, report heightened behavioral responses to the drug<sup>1,3,4,13,14</sup>. In contrast, experimental paradigms like the one employed here, in which HDAC inhibitors are administered more chronically, for several days prior to psychostimulant exposure, show inhibited expression<sup>3</sup> or decreased acquisition of behavioral adaptations to drug<sup>5,11,12</sup>. The clustering of seemingly discrepant results based on experimental methodologies is interesting in light of our present findings. Both HDAC inhibitors and psychostimulants increase global levels of histone acetylation in NAc. Thus, when co-administered acutely, these drugs may have synergistic effects, leading to heightened transcriptional activation of psychostimulant-regulated target genes. In contrast, when a psychostimulant is given in the context of prolonged, HDAC inhibitor-induced hyperacetylation, homeostatic processes may direct AcH3 binding to the promoters of genes (e.g., G9a) responsible for inducing chromatin condensation and gene repression (e.g., via H3K9me2) in order to dampen already heightened transcriptional activation.

Decreasing HDAC2 reverses both the molecular and behavioral consequences of alcohol addiction, thus implicating this enzyme as a potential treatment target (Fig. 3). HDAC2 is also crucial for the induction and maintenance of structural synaptic plasticity in other neurological domains such as memory formation [115]. Taken together, these findings underscore the potential usefulness of HDAC inhibition in treating alcohol use disorders&nbsp;... Given the ability of HDAC inhibitors to potently modulate the synaptic plasticity of learning and memory [118], these drugs hold potential as treatment for substance abuse-related disorders.&nbsp;... Our lab and others have published extensively on the ability of HDAC inhibitors to reverse the gene expression deficits caused by multiple models of alcoholism and alcohol abuse, the results of which were discussed above [25,112,113].

She is now distraught over her husband's neglect of her family. Often involved in some adventure, he rarely visits them. She sends their son [[Hyllus]] to find him, as she is concerned over prophecies about Heracles and the land he is currently in. After Hyllus sets off, a messenger arrives with word that Heracles, victorious in his recent battle, is making offerings on Cape [[Cenaeum]] and coming home soon to [[Trachis]].\n\n[[Lichas]], a herald of Heracles, brings in a procession of captives. He tells Deianeira a false story of why Heracles had laid siege to the city of Oechalia (in [[Euboea]]). He claimed [[King Eurytus of Oechalia|Eurytus]], the city's king, was responsible for Heracles being enslaved, and therefore Heracles vowed revenge against him and his people. Among the captured girls is [[Iole]], daughter of Eurytus. Deianeira soon learns that in truth Heracles laid siege to the city just to obtain Iole, whom he has taken as a lover.\n\nUnable to cope with the thought of her husband falling for this younger woman, she decides to use a love charm on him, a magic potion that will win him back.  When she was younger, she had been carried across a river by the [[centaur]], [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]. Halfway through he made a grab at her, but Heracles came to her rescue and quickly shot him with an arrow. As he died, he told her his blood, now mixed with the poison of the [[Lernaean Hydra]] in which Heracles' arrow had been dipped, would keep Heracles from loving any other woman more than her, if she follows his instructions. Deianeira dyes a robe with the blood and has Lichas carry it to Heracles with strict instructions that (a) no one else is to wear it, and (b) it is to be kept in the dark until he puts it on.\n\nAfter the gift is sent, she begins to have a bad feeling about it. She throws some of the left-over material into sunlight and it reacts like boiling acid. Nessus had lied about the love charm. Hyllus soon arrives to inform her that Heracles lies dying due to her gift. He was in such pain and fury that he killed Lichas, the deliverer of the gift: \"he made the white brain to ooze from the hair, as the skull was dashed to splinters, and blood scattered therewith\" (as translated by [[Sir Richard C. Jebb]]).\n\nDeianeira feels enormous shame for what she has done, amplified by her son's harsh words, and kills herself.  Hyllus discovers soon after that it wasn't actually her intention to kill her husband. The dying Heracles is carried to his home in horrible pain and furious over what he believes was a murder attempt by his wife. Hyllus explains the truth, and Heracles realizes that the prophecies about his death have come to pass: He was to be killed by someone who was already dead, and it turned out to be Nessus.\n\nIn the end, he is in so much pain that he is begging for someone to finish him off. In this weakened state, he says he is like a woman. He makes a final wish, which Hyllus promises to obey (under protest), that Hyllus is to marry Iole.

She is now distraught over her husband's neglect of her family. Often involved in some adventure, he rarely visits them. She sends their son [[Hyllus]] to find him, as she is concerned over prophecies about Heracles and the land he is currently in. After Hyllus sets off, a messenger arrives with word that Heracles, victorious in his recent battle, is making offerings on Cape [[Cenaeum]] and coming home soon to [[Trachis]].\n\n[[Lichas]], a herald of Heracles, brings in a procession of captives. He tells Deianeira a false story of why Heracles had laid siege to the city of Oechalia (in [[Euboea]]). He claimed [[King Eurytus of Oechalia|Eurytus]], the city's king, was responsible for Heracles being enslaved, and therefore Heracles vowed revenge against him and his people. Among the captured girls is [[Iole]], daughter of Eurytus. Deianeira soon learns that in truth Heracles laid siege to the city just to obtain Iole, whom he has taken as a lover.\n\nUnable to cope with the thought of her husband falling for this younger woman, she decides to use a love charm on him, a magic potion that will win him back.  When she was younger, she had been carried across a river by the [[centaur]], [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]. Halfway through he made a grab at her, but Heracles came to her rescue and quickly shot him with an arrow. As he died, he told her his blood, now mixed with the poison of the [[Lernaean Hydra]] in which Heracles' arrow had been dipped, would keep Heracles from loving any other woman more than her, if she follows his instructions. Deianeira dyes a robe with the blood and has Lichas carry it to Heracles with strict instructions that (a) no one else is to wear it, and (b) it is to be kept in the dark until he puts it on.\n\nAfter the gift is sent, she begins to have a bad feeling about it. She throws some of the left-over material into sunlight and it reacts like boiling acid. Nessus had lied about the love charm. Hyllus soon arrives to inform her that Heracles lies dying due to her gift. He was in such pain and fury that he killed Lichas, the deliverer of the gift: \"he made the white brain to ooze from the hair, as the skull was dashed to splinters, and blood scattered therewith\" (as translated by [[Sir Richard C. Jebb]]).\n\nDeianeira feels enormous shame for what she has done, amplified by her son's harsh words, and kills herself.  Hyllus discovers soon after that it wasn't actually her intention to kill her husband. The dying Heracles is carried to his home in horrible pain and furious over what he believes was a murder attempt by his wife. Hyllus explains the truth, and Heracles realizes that the prophecies about his death have come to pass: He was to be killed by someone who was already dead, and it turned out to be Nessus.\n\nIn the end, he is in so much pain that he is begging for someone to finish him off. In this weakened state, he says he is like a woman. He makes a final wish, which Hyllus promises to obey (under protest), that Hyllus is to marry Iole. The play concludes with Heracles being carried off to be burned alive, as an ending to his suffering.\n\n==Date==\nThe date of the first performance of ''Women of Trachis'' is unknown, and scholars have speculated a wide range of dates for its initial performance.
