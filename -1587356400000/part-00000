They recount the life and adventures of Thowra, a magnificent pale [[brumby]] (Australian wild horse) stallion, and his descendants, and are set in the [[Snowy Mountains]] region of Australia.\n\n==Characters==\n\n'''Thowra''': The Silver Brumby, Ghost Stallion. His cream coat, silvery mane and tail lead him to be hunted by man throughout his life.\n\n'''Bel Bel''': Thowra's cream coloured mother (she looks like Thowra). She taught him all she knew of the high country and of the dangers of man.\n\n'''Yarraman''': Thowra's handsome flaxen chestnut father. The greatest stallion of the High country mountains and king of the Cascade Brumbies.\n\n'''The Brolga''': The rival grey stallion. After battling Yarraman as a young stallion, he defeats and kills him when he reaches his prime. In turn, when Thowra reaches maturity, he defeats The Brolga, leaving him alive, and becomes king of the Cascade brumbies.\n\n'''Golden''': A palomino mare who, born with humans, is bought by the man pursuing Thowra. Thowra is intrigued by the stunning mare and shows her how to jump the fence of man. She lives with Thowra through the winter and into the summer. Through the winter Golden is carrying Thowra's foal. Although she lives in the wild, Golden lacked the confidence to give birth to Thowra's daughter without the help of man. Later, Thowra returns, bringing Golden and their foal, Kunama, to the Hidden Valley.\n\n'''Arrow''':\nThowra\u2019s older half brother(sired also by Yarraman) He is described to have Yarraman\u2019s flaxen chestnut colouring but his mother\u2019s cruel attitude and pinched looking face. \n\n'''Storm''' :\nThowra\u2019s bay half brother, sired by Yarraman. Storm\u2019s mother is Mirri\n\n'''Mirri''' :\nStorm\u2019s mother, best friend to Belbel. She is described as a bay mare.\n\n'''Kunama''' : The first daughter of Thowra and Golden. It means snow.\n\n'''Kunnilam''' : The second daughter of Thowra and Golden. It means sunshine.\n\n'''Cremebele''' : The third daughter of Thowra and Golden. It means creamy one.\n\n==The Silver Brumby==\n\n===Bel Bel=== hi I\u2019m me and u r I and I hate y\u2019all\n \n\n\n\n\n\n passed on both dilute and dun genes to Thowra.\n\n* No.1 Unknown Foal\n* No.2 Unknown Foal\n* No.3 Unknown Foal\n* Thowra\n* No.5 Chestnut Foal\n\n===Thowra===\n\nThowra is a creamy-silver stallion, son of the chestnut stallion Yarraman and the creamy mare Bel Bel. Being born in a storm, his dam named him after the Aboriginal word for 'wind' not only for the gale outside when he was born, but because she was worried he would have to be as fast as the wind to remain free from the tyranny of man. The majority of brumbies in the southern areas of Australia being black, bay, grey and yellow, the appearance of a cream horse causes quite a stir among wild herds and humans alike. Thowra is met with open hostility from other horses, stallions in particular, while the men of the mountains quickly become obsessed with trying to capture him for his rarity. To survive, Thowra is forced to become more cunning than both horse and man.\n\nThough he is mentioned in nearly every Silver Brumby book, Thowra is only a main character in ''The Silver Brumby'' (and ''Silver Brumby Whirlwind''), where he wins Golden for his mate, defeats the powerful stallion The Brolga, and becomes King of the Cascade Brumbies. However, there is always the ever-present threat of man, and at the end of the first novel, Thowra is forced to pull off a seemingly suicidal trick to stay free.\nThere is some indication that he can shapeshift into a white hawk and a whirlwind. \nIn the rest of the series, he is an ancestor of nearly all of the protagonists, and often helps them (and others) on their respective journeys.\n\n'''Colouring'''\n\nDue to the poetic license of the word \u2018silver\u2019 used to describe Thowra and his offspring it has misled some fans into believing that they are a pale grey or white, despite the fact they are described as \u2018cream\u2018 or 'creamies' just as often. The reason why he is known as 'The Silver Brumby' is that during winter Thowra's cream coat is described as becoming much paler, and takes on an almost silver sheen. In combination with his silver mane and tail, Thowra's pale winter coat enables him to blend into the snowy landscape of his native mountains.\n \nThough there is often much debate over the actual colour of the horses starring in the Silver Brumby novels, Thowra is almost most certainly a very pale [[palomino]], or \"Isabella.\" The reference to him and his kin as being \"creamies\" as well as silver would help back this up. Isabella palominos can be extremely light and comparable to a true \"cream\" or off-white colour. In Australian horsemen's language, \"creamy\" is a word used to refer to a palomino of any of the mid to lighter shades of this dilution. The final clue is that a sire who is [[Chestnut (coat)|chestnut]], combined with a palomino mother, is the perfect genetic recipe for palomino offspring since palomino is the presence of the [[cream gene]] over a chestnut base. Thowra would inherit the potential for chestnut from both his father AND mother. And his mother would provide the one creme gene he would need to share her own colour. The fact that Yarraman is described as a light chestnut makes an \"Isabella\", (or pale palomino) foal even more likely. It could be argued that some of Thowra's own offspring with Golden (most certainly also a palomino) might be [[Cream gene|cremello]] (double-dilute creme and even more pale, with pink skin and blue eyes), but Thowra himself could only really be a palomino.\n\nOther genealogical evidence from the books suggests that Thowra and the other \"creamies\", including his dam Bel Bel, daughter Kunama, son Lightning, and grandson Baringa are also Palominos, rather than cremello, which is the next most likely colouring. In 'The Silver Brumby', the special relationship between Thowra and his mother Bel Bel is due to their unusual shared colouring: Bel Bel's other foals by the chestnut stallion Yarraman are all chestnut.\n\nIn the cartoon series and the movie released in the mid-1990s, the 'creamies' are represented as Palominos, but earlier cover art shows the silver horses as greys (white) [http://www.janebadgerbooks.co.uk/australia/emitchell.html Original Cover Art]. Despite the early representation of Thowra as a [[Gray (horse)|grey]] horse, there are several grey horses within the books, including Thowra's mate Boon Boon, and the grey stallion Cloud and his mate, which are considered as distinctly different in colour from the 'creamies'. The two mares which form the foundation for Baringa's herd in \"Silver Brumby Kingdom\", Dawn and Moon, are described as being a highly unusual colour which like the colour 'creamy' is distinguished from a grey horse, and is described simply as 'white'. These horses are likely to have been what is now called 'cremello' or possibly 'smoky cream', rather than 'dominant white', as they are both out of two grey parents (neither of their parents could, therefore, carry the dominant white gene). Their foals by the 'creamy' Baringa are described as 'creamies' ( a 50% likelihood of a mating between a Palomino and a cremello horse). Though there are other ways for pure white foals to crop up, like a foal who is a grey, and 'greys out' early in life. Another possibility is maximum [[Sabino horse|sabino]] or maximum [[tobiano]].\n\nThowra is described as siring only three foals which are creamy like himself, these being an unnamed creamy foal upon the grey mare Boon Boon (which may have greyed out over a few years), and the true creamies the filly Kunama and colt Lightning from the creamy mare Golden. Golden is described as being a 'creamy' like Thowra himself, yet is much more clearly identified as being a Palomino by her name, indicating that she is probably a darker, more traditionally 'golden' coloured Palomino, though clearly still identifiable as being the same colour as Thowra.\n\nIn 'Silver Brumbies of the South', Thowra muses upon the fact that outside of these three foals, he had had no silver foals. Instead, 'he had got many creamies with dark points who rarely went free, for the men always hunted them, and he had got taffies, and some strangely handsome duns'. A 'creamy with dark points' would be a [[Buckskin (horse)|buckskin]], whilst 'Taffy' is the Australian term for what is sometimes called 'chocolate silver', or a brown coat with pale silvery mane and tail. These foals would have inherited one copy of the cream dilution gene from their sire, and their base colour from their mothers, but the unusual colours mentioned indicate that the 'silver' brumby carried other colour modifying genes in addition to the cream dilution gene, potentially including the [[silver dapple gene]] (which results in taffy), the [[dun gene]] or the [[flaxen gene]].\n\n===Thowra's Herd===\n*Boon Boon (daughter of The Brolga)\n*Golden\n*Kunama (but once fully grown, joined Tambo's Herd)\n*Koora\n*Cirrus\n*Yuri\n*Wingilla (born from Boon Boon)\n*unnamed black mare\n*2 unnamed grey mares (daughters of The Brolga)\n*unnamed chestnut daughter of Arrow\n*Arrow's black mare\n*creamy colt with dark points (firstborn of Boon Boon)\n*2 unnamed dun foals\n* Jillamatong 'Jilla' (creamy with dark points, born in Thowra's Cascade Herd)\n* Wanga (creamy with dark points, born in Thowra's Cascade Herd)\n* Yuri\n* Dilkara\nMany unnamed mares are also in his herd but are not mentioned in the story as they run separately with Storm's herd.\n\n===Silver Brumby's Daughter===\n\n===Kunama===\n\nThowra and Golden's daughter, Kunama, is a free-spirited and beautiful young filly, one of the first creamies begotten by Thowra. Her name means snow.\nAs a two-year-old, she is shown to possess a depth of intuition that is not shared by Thowra, her sire. This is perhaps partially because mares, without the luxury of a stallion's great strength and with the responsibility of foals at foot, must possess even greater wisdom than even the stallions of their herds if they are to remain free and wild. Kunama, having been trained in bush craft by both Thowra and Boon Boon, is cautious and wary of men, but not even this caution is enough to keep her in Thowra's Hidden Valley when her interest is captured by a young, spirited black stallion with an unusual splash of white on his flank, named Tambo, who is the son of a chestnut racehorse and another racehorse 'Highland Lass.' In the wild excitement of running with another young horse, Kunama does not heed the warnings of the wiser bush animals, and runs in the mountains for far longer than she should, even returning to the Cascades with Tambo during the summer, despite it being 'a time a silver filly must remain hidden or fear capture.' Eventually, a boy and his father manage to capture the silver filly, with the intention of turning her into a stock horse, but Kunama's longing for her freedom only succeeds in turning her into what the stock men call a bad horse. Kunama is eventually given her freedom by the boy out of pity, and she makes her way back to the Hidden Valley, remaining there with Tambo.\n\nKunama is full sister to Lighting and half-sister to Jillamatongagonga and Wangagonga, both creamies but with dark freckles. She is very damn Baringaginga and an unnamed chestnut filly.\n\n===Silver Brumbies of the South-Silver Brumby Kingdom===\n\n===Baringa===\n\nNephew to Lightning and son of Kunama, Baringa is a true silver horse. Strong, swift and smart, he is truly Thowra's grandson.\nBut when Thowra takes him to the southern lands he is only a yearling. When he adds the beautiful Dawn to his herd, life becomes even more dangerous. However, Baringa soon finds a secret canyon where he can keep his herd, and he learns how to fight just as well as his grandsire. Eventually, he becomes the Silver Stallion of Quambat Flat.\n\nBaringa's name means 'dawn' or 'light' in an Aboriginal language.\nBaringa's story is told in the books \"Silver Brumbies of the South\" and \"Silver Brumby Kingdom.\"\nBaringa is also known to have the most beautiful herd anyone has seen in the south.\n\nBaringa's Herd\n\n*Dawn: 'white and silver' filly\n*Moon: 'white and silver' filly\n*Yarolala: flaxen chestnut filly. Throwback to Yarraman. Daughter of Son Of Storm\n*Kalina: 'Cream and silver' colt. Baringa's first-born son. First foal of Dawn. Born during a great flood\n*An unnamed snow white filly foal by Moon\n*A blue roan filly, daughter of White-Face\n*A lazy pert round white mare who belonged to the black stallion previously, she thinks everything is a joke\n\n===Dawn===\nThe first mare to join Baringa's herd, Lightning and Baringa first saw her dancing in a spiral of silver mist on Quambat Flat. Though Lightning tried many times to (unsuccessfully) win Dawn over, she decided to run with the more compassionate Baringa.\nIn the events of ''Silver Brumby Kingdom'', Dawn is separated from the herd by a terrible flood and Baringa goes to search for her, eventually finding her on a small island in the middle of a river.\nBy this time she has borne Baringa's foal, whom they name Kalina.\nOf interest is the fact that, though Baringa already has a herd, it is heavily implied in ''Silver Brumby Kingdom'' that Dawn is the mare he loves most, even to the extent of leaving his herd to search for her.\nDawn is Moon's half-sister, and the two seem to be great friends.\n\n===Moon===\nThe second mare to join Baringaginga's herd; was called the 'hidden one'. She looks and has the same hoofprint as her half-sister Dawn. Moon originally followed The Ugly One. Her first foal was a snowy white filly.\n\n===Pert White Mare===\nOne of the mares Thowra brought for Baringa. She was originally owned by the black stallion, but when Thowra decided to steal her, she went along willingly, yet slowly. She is described as 'lazy' and 'round'. Often called \"Pert\"\nThowra is embarrassed but enjoys her stubbornness and is often 'fun'.\n\n===Unnamed Blue Roan Mare===\nOne of the mares Thowra brought for Baringa. When Thowra was looking for Baringa, she was the only one of her herd to tell him anything.\n\n===Kalina===\nSon of Dawn and Baringa, Kalina was born when Dawn was swept by the river onto a small island, and it took Baringa days to find her. Though Baringa originally wanted to name Kalina after the flood, Dawn believed that their foal shouldn't be called something so terrible, and they named him Kalina - \"for the marvellous beauty of the frost on snow\". He also sired Yuri's foal whilst they were searching for Thowra .\n\n===Koora===\nThowra's mare whom he left to run with Baringa. Had a silver colt with pale roan ears, Dilkara.\n\n===Lightning===\n\nSon of Thowra and Golden and the full brother of Kunama. Lightning is one of the only three silver foals Thowra sires. After being hidden away in the Secret Valley for two years, he is taken south by Thowra, along with Baringa.\nLightning is beautiful but arrogant and is said by Thowra to have been almost as difficult as Golden to train in the way of the bush. He is captivated by Dawn's beauty and constantly pursues her for his herd. However it appears that Goonda is the mare he loves the most. When the black stallion comes looking for his stolen mares and becomes captivated by Goonda, Lightning learnt one thing. He learnt that even the remembered beauty of Dawn meant nothing to him compared with his feeling for Goonda.\n\nLightning finally concedes that he must not go after Baringa's mares when Baringa defeats the black stallion when he could not.\n\nLightning's Herd\n\n*Goonda: Red roan filly\n*unnamed colt born to Goonda\n*2 unnamed grey mares\n*2 blue roan mares (Stolen from the black stallion and won by Baringa who gifts them to Lightning)\n*Yarolala: Chestnut flaxen filly (who later joins Baringa's herd)\n*3 unnamed roan mares (Stolen and taken back by the black)\n\n===Goonda===\nGoonda is a beautiful red(chestnut/sorrel) roan mare and the first mare to join Lightning's herd when they were both two years old. She is the daughter of Whiteface. Lightning won her after his first real fight against another grey colt. Her name means fire. She grows into a lovely mare with Thowra surprised at how beautiful she's become and the black stallion stopping in his tracks when he saw her. She adores Lightning and when she sees him fight for her as though possessed by the spirit of Thowra, knows that she will belong to Lightning forever.\n\n===Yarolala===\nA chestnut flaxen filly whose colouring is a throwback to the Yarraman line. She is a daughter of Son of Storm.\nYarolala heeds Lightning's call with the intention of following Baringa but loses track of him as he melts into the bush before either she or Lightning realizes he's gone. She stays with Lightning's herd but spends most of her time wandering in search of Baringa who she considers to be 'the most beautiful horse in the mountains'.\n\n===Other books in the series===\n\n===Moon FillyDelfia (1968)===\n\nThe colt Wurring is devoted to the beautiful orphan FillyDelfia Ilinga. But as she grows older and even more lovely, other stallions will challenge Wurring for her, including a mean iron grey stallion. Will the pair be separated?\n                                     \n\n                                                                                                 '''YES!'''\n\n===Ilinga===\nOne of the two protagonists of Moon Filly, Illinga is a strangely beautiful mare who is desperately trying to find Wurring (and vice versa) despite the efforts of an evil iron-grey stallion.\n\n'''Colouring'''\n\nThe description of Yuri's coat colour is strange since she is described as being both a dark chestnut, and as having a coat that \"glows\" at night by reflecting the moonlight. This calls to mind the metallic coats of Akhal-Teke's, though this unusual metallic or \"satin\" sheen can occur in any horse breed. Champagne horses are also noted for this unusual sheen, though the occurrence of the rather new champagne colour in brumbies seems highly unlikely. It is heavily suggested by Elyne Mitchell that the \"moon horses\" are a special breed that is very refined and beautiful beyond their colour alone. Was she inspired by the rare Akhal-Teke? Or perhaps by Arabians? (a known influence on wild brumbies along with their descendants the Thoroughbreds.) Only the author herself would truly know that.\n\nYuri's sire Wurring also may carry this glowing metallic sheen since he is described as glowing like the sun itself.\n\nAnother horse whose coat colour is under debate is Ilinga. Although for the most part described to be a very dark brown, she is later (as she matures) described to have silver hairs running through her hair. Those with a better knowledge of horse genetics argue that she is much more likely a silver dapple black, (a black base with the silver dilution gene which dilutes black pigment to a paler, almost cream colour at times) because she is described with 'the colour of moonlight running across her back,' and strands of silver in her hair. This would certainly tie in better to explain the connection with the moon because of the colour contrast, and throughout the novels the colour of the character has been significant. But since silver dapples are described in some of the brumby novels, it seems strange that the author would not describe them as such. Another possible fault in this theory is that she does not seem to have been born silver dapple black, but rather turned this colour as she matured.

They recount the life and adventures of Thowra, a magnificent pale [[brumby]] (Australian wild horse) stallion, and his descendants, and are set in the [[Snowy Mountains]] region of Australia.\n\n==Characters==\n\n'''Thowra''': The Silver Brumby, Ghost Stallion. His cream coat, silvery mane and tail lead him to be hunted by man throughout his life.\n\n'''Bel Bel''': Thowra's cream coloured mother (she looks like Thowra). She taught him all she knew of the high country and of the dangers of man.\n\n'''Yarraman''': Thowra's handsome flaxen chestnut father. The greatest stallion of the High country mountains and king of the Cascade Brumbies.\n\n'''The Brolga''': The rival grey stallion. After battling Yarraman as a young stallion, he defeats and kills him when he reaches his prime. In turn, when Thowra reaches maturity, he defeats The Brolga, leaving him alive, and becomes king of the Cascade brumbies.\n\n'''Golden''': A palomino mare who, born with humans, is bought by the man pursuing Thowra. Thowra is intrigued by the stunning mare and shows her how to jump the fence of man. She lives with Thowra through the winter and into the summer. Through the winter Golden is carrying Thowra's foal. Although she lives in the wild, Golden lacked the confidence to give birth to Thowra's daughter without the help of man. Later, Thowra returns, bringing Golden and their foal, Kunama, to the Hidden Valley.\n\n'''Arrow''':\nThowra\u2019s older half brother(sired also by Yarraman) He is described to have Yarraman\u2019s flaxen chestnut colouring but his mother\u2019s cruel attitude and pinched looking face. \n\n'''Storm''' :\nThowra\u2019s bay half brother, sired by Yarraman. Storm\u2019s mother is Mirri\n\n'''Mirri''' :\nStorm\u2019s mother, best friend to Belbel. She is described as a bay mare.\n\n'''Kunama''' : The first daughter of Thowra and Golden. It means snow.\n\n'''Kunnilam''' : The second daughter of Thowra and Golden. It means sunshine.\n\n'''Cremebele''' : The third daughter of Thowra and Golden. It means creamy one.\n\n==The Silver Brumby==\n\n===Bel Bel===\n\nAn extremely wise, creamy mare, mother of Thowra and good friends with Mirri, Storm's mother. Bel Bel runs with the stallion Yarraman, and in some cases is entrusted to go ahead and guide. Bel Bel, like Thowra, is scared of people, although in her case because she had always been hunted for her unusual colouration. She showed her son Thowra the ways of the hunted life, passing all her wisdom to him, which in turn Thowra passed down to his mare, Boon Boon, his daughter, Kunama, and his grandson, Baringa. He also tried to pass it down to his son, Lightning, and one of his favorite mares, Golden. Bel Bel is often described as a 'lone wolf' and dies on her own on the Ramshead Range, after one final chase. Bel Bel was the lead mare of Yarraman's herd.\nShe is described in The Silver Brumby's Daughter as an old creamy mare with dark points and great, wise eyes. This is a little puzzling, as at no other time are dark point mentioned. As such, she would be a buckskin or a dun. Thowra's colouration and progeny suggest that Bel Bel carried and passed on both dilute and dun genes to Thowra.\n\n* No.1 Unknown Foal\n* No.2 Unknown Foal\n* No.3 Unknown Foal\n* Thowra\n* No.5 Chestnut Foal\n\n===Thowra===\n\nThowra is a creamy-silver stallion, son of the chestnut stallion Yarraman and the creamy mare Bel Bel. Being born in a storm, his dam named him after the Aboriginal word for 'wind' not only for the gale outside when he was born, but because she was worried he would have to be as fast as the wind to remain free from the tyranny of man. The majority of brumbies in the southern areas of Australia being black, bay, grey and yellow, the appearance of a cream horse causes quite a stir among wild herds and humans alike. Thowra is met with open hostility from other horses, stallions in particular, while the men of the mountains quickly become obsessed with trying to capture him for his rarity. To survive, Thowra is forced to become more cunning than both horse and man.\n\nThough he is mentioned in nearly every Silver Brumby book, Thowra is only a main character in ''The Silver Brumby'' (and ''Silver Brumby Whirlwind''), where he wins Golden for his mate, defeats the powerful stallion The Brolga, and becomes King of the Cascade Brumbies. However, there is always the ever-present threat of man, and at the end of the first novel, Thowra is forced to pull off a seemingly suicidal trick to stay free.\nThere is some indication that he can shapeshift into a white hawk and a whirlwind. \nIn the rest of the series, he is an ancestor of nearly all of the protagonists, and often helps them (and others) on their respective journeys.\n\n'''Colouring'''\n\nDue to the poetic license of the word \u2018silver\u2019 used to describe Thowra and his offspring it has misled some fans into believing that they are a pale grey or white, despite the fact they are described as \u2018cream\u2018 or 'creamies' just as often. The reason why he is known as 'The Silver Brumby' is that during winter Thowra's cream coat is described as becoming much paler, and takes on an almost silver sheen. In combination with his silver mane and tail, Thowra's pale winter coat enables him to blend into the snowy landscape of his native mountains.\n \nThough there is often much debate over the actual colour of the horses starring in the Silver Brumby novels, Thowra is almost most certainly a very pale [[palomino]], or \"Isabella.\" The reference to him and his kin as being \"creamies\" as well as silver would help back this up. Isabella palominos can be extremely light and comparable to a true \"cream\" or off-white colour. In Australian horsemen's language, \"creamy\" is a word used to refer to a palomino of any of the mid to lighter shades of this dilution. The final clue is that a sire who is [[Chestnut (coat)|chestnut]], combined with a palomino mother, is the perfect genetic recipe for palomino offspring since palomino is the presence of the [[cream gene]] over a chestnut base. Thowra would inherit the potential for chestnut from both his father AND mother. And his mother would provide the one creme gene he would need to share her own colour. The fact that Yarraman is described as a light chestnut makes an \"Isabella\", (or pale palomino) foal even more likely. It could be argued that some of Thowra's own offspring with Golden (most certainly also a palomino) might be [[Cream gene|cremello]] (double-dilute creme and even more pale, with pink skin and blue eyes), but Thowra himself could only really be a palomino.\n\nOther genealogical evidence from the books suggests that Thowra and the other \"creamies\", including his dam Bel Bel, daughter Kunama, son Lightning, and grandson Baringa are also Palominos, rather than cremello, which is the next most likely colouring. In 'The Silver Brumby', the special relationship between Thowra and his mother Bel Bel is due to their unusual shared colouring: Bel Bel's other foals by the chestnut stallion Yarraman are all chestnut.\n\nIn the cartoon series and the movie released in the mid-1990s, the 'creamies' are represented as Palominos, but earlier cover art shows the silver horses as greys (white) [http://www.janebadgerbooks.co.uk/australia/emitchell.html Original Cover Art]. Despite the early representation of Thowra as a [[Gray (horse)|grey]] horse, there are several grey horses within the books, including Thowra's mate Boon Boon, and the grey stallion Cloud and his mate, which are considered as distinctly different in colour from the 'creamies'. The two mares which form the foundation for Baringa's herd in \"Silver Brumby Kingdom\", Dawn and Moon, are described as being a highly unusual colour which like the colour 'creamy' is distinguished from a grey horse, and is described simply as 'white'. These horses are likely to have been what is now called 'cremello' or possibly 'smoky cream', rather than 'dominant white', as they are both out of two grey parents (neither of their parents could, therefore, carry the dominant white gene). Their foals by the 'creamy' Baringa are described as 'creamies' ( a 50% likelihood of a mating between a Palomino and a cremello horse). Though there are other ways for pure white foals to crop up, like a foal who is a grey, and 'greys out' early in life. Another possibility is maximum [[Sabino horse|sabino]] or maximum [[tobiano]].\n\nThowra is described as siring only three foals which are creamy like himself, these being an unnamed creamy foal upon the grey mare Boon Boon (which may have greyed out over a few years), and the true creamies the filly Kunama and colt Lightning from the creamy mare Golden. Golden is described as being a 'creamy' like Thowra himself, yet is much more clearly identified as being a Palomino by her name, indicating that she is probably a darker, more traditionally 'golden' coloured Palomino, though clearly still identifiable as being the same colour as Thowra.\n\nIn 'Silver Brumbies of the South', Thowra muses upon the fact that outside of these three foals, he had had no silver foals. Instead, 'he had got many creamies with dark points who rarely went free, for the men always hunted them, and he had got taffies, and some strangely handsome duns'. A 'creamy with dark points' would be a [[Buckskin (horse)|buckskin]], whilst 'Taffy' is the Australian term for what is sometimes called 'chocolate silver', or a brown coat with pale silvery mane and tail. These foals would have inherited one copy of the cream dilution gene from their sire, and their base colour from their mothers, but the unusual colours mentioned indicate that the 'silver' brumby carried other colour modifying genes in addition to the cream dilution gene, potentially including the [[silver dapple gene]] (which results in taffy), the [[dun gene]] or the [[flaxen gene]].\n\n===Thowra's Herd===\n*Boon Boon (daughter of The Brolga)\n*Golden\n*Kunama (but once fully grown, joined Tambo's Herd)\n*Koora\n*Cirrus\n*Yuri\n*Wingilla (born from Boon Boon)\n*unnamed black mare\n*2 unnamed grey mares (daughters of The Brolga)\n*unnamed chestnut daughter of Arrow\n*Arrow's black mare\n*creamy colt with dark points (firstborn of Boon Boon)\n*2 unnamed dun foals\n* Jillamatong 'Jilla' (creamy with dark points, born in Thowra's Cascade Herd)\n* Wanga (creamy with dark points, born in Thowra's Cascade Herd)\n* Yuri\n* Dilkara\nMany unnamed mares are also in his herd but are not mentioned in the story as they run separately with Storm's herd.\n\n===Silver Brumby's Daughter===\n\n===Kunama===\n\nThowra and Golden's daughter, Kunama, is a free-spirited and beautiful young filly, one of the first creamies begotten by Thowra. Her name means snow.\nAs a two-year-old, she is shown to possess a depth of intuition that is not shared by Thowra, her sire. This is perhaps partially because mares, without the luxury of a stallion's great strength and with the responsibility of foals at foot, must possess even greater wisdom than even the stallions of their herds if they are to remain free and wild. Kunama, having been trained in bush craft by both Thowra and Boon Boon, is cautious and wary of men, but not even this caution is enough to keep her in Thowra's Hidden Valley when her interest is captured by a young, spirited black stallion with an unusual splash of white on his flank, named Tambo, who is the son of a chestnut racehorse and another racehorse 'Highland Lass.' In the wild excitement of running with another young horse, Kunama does not heed the warnings of the wiser bush animals, and runs in the mountains for far longer than she should, even returning to the Cascades with Tambo during the summer, despite it being 'a time a silver filly must remain hidden or fear capture.' Eventually, a boy and his father manage to capture the silver filly, with the intention of turning her into a stock horse, but Kunama's longing for her freedom only succeeds in turning her into what the stock men call a bad horse. Kunama is eventually given her freedom by the boy out of pity, and she makes her way back to the Hidden Valley, remaining there with Tambo.\n\nKunama is full sister to Lighting and half-sister to Jillamatongagonga and Wangagonga, both creamies but with dark freckles. She is very damn Baringaginga and an unnamed chestnut filly.\n\n===Silver Brumbies of the South-Silver Brumby Kingdom===\n\n===Baringa===\n\nNephew to Lightning and son of Kunama, Baringa is a true silver horse. Strong, swift and smart, he is truly Thowra's grandson.\nBut when Thowra takes him to the southern lands he is only a yearling. When he adds the beautiful Dawn to his herd, life becomes even more dangerous. However, Baringa soon finds a secret canyon where he can keep his herd, and he learns how to fight just as well as his grandsire. Eventually, he becomes the Silver Stallion of Quambat Flat.\n\nBaringa's name means 'dawn' or 'light' in an Aboriginal language.\nBaringa's story is told in the books \"Silver Brumbies of the South\" and \"Silver Brumby Kingdom.\"\nBaringa is also known to have the most beautiful herd anyone has seen in the south.\n\nBaringa's Herd\n\n*Dawn: 'white and silver' filly\n*Moon: 'white and silver' filly\n*Yarolala: flaxen chestnut filly. Throwback to Yarraman. Daughter of Son Of Storm\n*Kalina: 'Cream and silver' colt. Baringa's first-born son. First foal of Dawn. Born during a great flood\n*An unnamed snow white filly foal by Moon\n*A blue roan filly, daughter of White-Face\n*A lazy pert round white mare who belonged to the black stallion previously, she thinks everything is a joke\n\n===Dawn===\nThe first mare to join Baringa's herd, Lightning and Baringa first saw her dancing in a spiral of silver mist on Quambat Flat. Though Lightning tried many times to (unsuccessfully) win Dawn over, she decided to run with the more compassionate Baringa.\nIn the events of ''Silver Brumby Kingdom'', Dawn is separated from the herd by a terrible flood and Baringa goes to search for her, eventually finding her on a small island in the middle of a river.\nBy this time she has borne Baringa's foal, whom they name Kalina.\nOf interest is the fact that, though Baringa already has a herd, it is heavily implied in ''Silver Brumby Kingdom'' that Dawn is the mare he loves most, even to the extent of leaving his herd to search for her.\nDawn is Moon's half-sister, and the two seem to be great friends.\n\n===Moon===\nThe second mare to join Baringaginga's herd; was called the 'hidden one'. She looks and has the same hoofprint as her half-sister Dawn. Moon originally followed The Ugly One. Her first foal was a snowy white filly.\n\n===Pert White Mare===\nOne of the mares Thowra brought for Baringa. She was originally owned by the black stallion, but when Thowra decided to steal her, she went along willingly, yet slowly. She is described as 'lazy' and 'round'. Often called \"Pert\"\nThowra is embarrassed but enjoys her stubbornness and is often 'fun'.\n\n===Unnamed Blue Roan Mare===\nOne of the mares Thowra brought for Baringa. When Thowra was looking for Baringa, she was the only one of her herd to tell him anything.\n\n===Kalina===\nSon of Dawn and Baringa, Kalina was born when Dawn was swept by the river onto a small island, and it took Baringa days to find her. Though Baringa originally wanted to name Kalina after the flood, Dawn believed that their foal shouldn't be called something so terrible, and they named him Kalina - \"for the marvellous beauty of the frost on snow\". He also sired Yuri's foal whilst they were searching for Thowra .\n\n===Koora===\nThowra's mare whom he left to run with Baringa. Had a silver colt with pale roan ears, Dilkara.\n\n===Lightning===\n\nSon of Thowra and Golden and the full brother of Kunama. Lightning is one of the only three silver foals Thowra sires. After being hidden away in the Secret Valley for two years, he is taken south by Thowra, along with Baringa.\nLightning is beautiful but arrogant and is said by Thowra to have been almost as difficult as Golden to train in the way of the bush. He is captivated by Dawn's beauty and constantly pursues her for his herd. However it appears that Goonda is the mare he loves the most. When the black stallion comes looking for his stolen mares and becomes captivated by Goonda, Lightning learnt one thing. He learnt that even the remembered beauty of Dawn meant nothing to him compared with his feeling for Goonda.\n\nLightning finally concedes that he must not go after Baringa's mares when Baringa defeats the black stallion when he could not.\n\nLightning's Herd\n\n*Goonda: Red roan filly\n*unnamed colt born to Goonda\n*2 unnamed grey mares\n*2 blue roan mares (Stolen from the black stallion and won by Baringa who gifts them to Lightning)\n*Yarolala: Chestnut flaxen filly (who later joins Baringa's herd)\n*3 unnamed roan mares (Stolen and taken back by the black)\n\n===Goonda===\nGoonda is a beautiful red(chestnut/sorrel) roan mare and the first mare to join Lightning's herd when they were both two years old. She is the daughter of Whiteface. Lightning won her after his first real fight against another grey colt. Her name means fire. She grows into a lovely mare with Thowra surprised at how beautiful she's become and the black stallion stopping in his tracks when he saw her. She adores Lightning and when she sees him fight for her as though possessed by the spirit of Thowra, knows that she will belong to Lightning forever.\n\n===Yarolala===\nA chestnut flaxen filly whose colouring is a throwback to the Yarraman line. She is a daughter of Son of Storm.\nYarolala heeds Lightning's call with the intention of following Baringa but loses track of him as he melts into the bush before either she or Lightning realizes he's gone. She stays with Lightning's herd but spends most of her time wandering in search of Baringa who she considers to be 'the most beautiful horse in the mountains'.\n\n===Other books in the series===\n\n===Moon FillyDelfia (1968)===\n\nThe colt Wurring is devoted to the beautiful orphan FillyDelfia Ilinga. But as she grows older and even more lovely, other stallions will challenge Wurring for her, including a mean iron grey stallion. Will the pair be separated?\n                                     \n\n                                                                                                 '''YES!'''\n\n===Ilinga===\nOne of the two protagonists of Moon Filly, Illinga is a strangely beautiful mare who is desperately trying to find Wurring (and vice versa) despite the efforts of an evil iron-grey stallion.\n\n'''Colouring'''\n\nThe description of Yuri's coat colour is strange since she is described as being both a dark chestnut, and as having a coat that \"glows\" at night by reflecting the moonlight. This calls to mind the metallic coats of Akhal-Teke's, though this unusual metallic or \"satin\" sheen can occur in any horse breed. Champagne horses are also noted for this unusual sheen, though the occurrence of the rather new champagne colour in brumbies seems highly unlikely. It is heavily suggested by Elyne Mitchell that the \"moon horses\" are a special breed that is very refined and beautiful beyond their colour alone. Was she inspired by the rare Akhal-Teke? Or perhaps by Arabians? (a known influence on wild brumbies along with their descendants the Thoroughbreds.) Only the author herself would truly know that.\n\nYuri's sire Wurring also may carry this glowing metallic sheen since he is described as glowing like the sun itself.\n\nAnother horse whose coat colour is under debate is Ilinga. Although for the most part described to be a very dark brown, she is later (as she matures) described to have silver hairs running through her hair. Those with a better knowledge of horse genetics argue that she is much more likely a silver dapple black, (a black base with the silver dilution gene which dilutes black pigment to a paler, almost cream colour at times) because she is described with 'the colour of moonlight running across her back,' and strands of silver in her hair. This would certainly tie in better to explain the connection with the moon because of the colour contrast, and throughout the novels the colour of the character has been significant. But since silver dapples are described in some of the brumby novels, it seems strange that the author would not describe them as such. Another possible fault in this theory is that she does not seem to have been born silver dapple black, but rather turned this colour as she matured. Silver dapple horses are often born a buff or cream colour and with their first shed reveal their adult coat. \n\nAll this confusion over colour could simply be an over-analysis on the part of enthusiastic brumby book fans. Perhaps Elyne Mitchell herself, though clearly very knowledgeable about horses, was taking creative license in describing the colours of her horses, without giving any regard to how likely they were or the possible genetics.\n\n== Silver Brumby books, in order of publication ==\n*''[[The Silver Brumby (novel)|The Silver Brumby]]'' (1958) ({{ISBN|0006754708}}, paperback reprint)\n*''Silver Brumby's Daughter'' (1960)\n*''Silver Brumbies of the South'' (1965)\n*''Silver Brumby Kingdom'' (1966)\n*''Moon Filly'' (1968)\n*''Silver Brumby Whirlwind'' (1973)\n*''Son of the Whirlwind'' (1979)\n*''Silver Brumby, Silver Dingo'' (1993)\n*''Dancing Brumby'' (1995)\n*''Brumbies of the Night'' (1996)\n*''Dancing Brumby's Rainbow'' (1998)\n*''The Thousandth Brumby'' (1999)\n*''Brumby Stories'' (1999) (compilation)\n\n==Adaptations ==\n\nIn 1993 the first book, ''The Silver Brumby'', was adapted into a [[The Silver Brumby (1993 film)|film of the same name]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dGYzZLrBrS4C&lpg=PA1&pg=PA20#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Animal Movies Guide | publisher=Running Free Press | author=Wilson, Staci Layne | year=2007 | pages=20}}</ref> The film starred [[Russell Crowe]], [[Caroline Goodall]] and [[Amiel Daemion]].

{"title_page": "Community of practice", "text_new": "{{Community}}\nA '''community of practice''' ('''CoP''') is a group of people who share a craft or a profession. The concept was first proposed by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Jean Lave]] and educational theorist [[Etienne Wenger]] in their 1991 book ''Situated Learning'' {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book ''Communities of Practice'' {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}.\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunch room at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) {{Harv|Dub\u00e9|Bourhis|Jacob|2005}} when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance{{Harv|Sheridan|2015}}. A \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) {{Harv|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}} is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [[American pragmatism]], especially [[C. S. Peirce]]'s concept of the \"[[community of inquiry]]\" {{harv|Shields|2003}}, but also [[John Dewey]]'s principle of learning through occupation {{harv|Wallace|2007}}.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n===Origin and development===\nSince the publication of \"Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation\" {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}, communities of practice have been the focus of attention, first as a theory of learning and later as part of the field of knowledge management. See {{Harvtxt|Hildreth|Kimble|2004|}} for a review of how the concept has changed over the years. {{Harvtxt|Cox|2005}} offers a more critical view of the different ways in which the term communities of practice can be interpreted.\n\n====Early years====\nTo understand how learning occurs outside the classroom while at the [[Institute for Research on Learning]], Lave and Wenger studied how newcomers or novices to informal groups become established members of those groups {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Lave and Wenger first used the term communities of practice to describe learning through practice and participation, which they named [[situated learning]].\n\nThe structure of the community was created over time through a process of [[legitimate peripheral participation]]. Legitimation and participation together define the characteristic ways of belonging to a community whereas peripherality and participation are concerned with location and identity in the social world {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991|p= 29}}.\n\nLave and Wenger's research looked at how apprenticeships help people learn. They found that when newcomers join an established group or community, they spend some time initially observing and perhaps performing simple tasks in basic roles as they learn how the group works and how they can participate (an apprentice electrician, for example would watch and learn before actually doing any electrical work; initially taking on small simple jobs and eventually more complicated ones). Lave and Wenger described this socialization process as legitimate peripheral participation. The term \"community of practice\" is that group that Lave and Wenger referred to, who share a common interest and a desire to learn from and contribute to the community with their variety of experiences {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\n====Later years====\nIn his later work, {{Harvtxt|Wenger|1998}} abandoned the concept of legitimate peripheral participation and used the idea of an inherent tension in a [[Duality (CoPs)|duality]] instead.  He identifies four dualities that exist in communities of practice, participation-reification, designed-emergent, identification-negotiability and local-global, although the participation-reification duality has been the focus of particular interest because of its links to [[knowledge management]].\n\nHe describes the structure of a CoP as consisting of three interrelated terms: '[[mutual engagement]]', 'joint enterprise' and 'shared repertoire' {{Harv|Wenger|1998|pp= 72\u201373}}.\n\n* Mutual Engagement: Firstly, through participation in the community, members establish norms and build collaborative relationships; this is termed mutual engagement.  These relationships are the ties that bind the members of the community together as a social entity.\n* Joint Enterprise: Secondly, through their interactions, they create a shared understanding of what binds them together; this is termed the joint enterprise.  The joint enterprise is (re)negotiated by its members and is sometimes referred to as the 'domain' of the community.\n* Shared Repertoire: Finally, as part of its practice, the community produces a set of communal resources, which is termed their shared repertoire; this is used in the pursuit of their joint enterprise and can include both literal and symbolic meanings.\n\n====Present work====\nFor [[Etienne Wenger]], [[learning]] is central to human [[identity (social science)|identity]]. A primary focus of Wenger's more recent work is on learning as social participation \u2013 the individual as an active participant in the practices of social communities, and in the construction of his/her identity through these communities {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}. In this context, a community of practice is a group of individuals participating in communal activity, and experiencing/continuously creating their shared identity through engaging in and contributing to the practices of their communities.\n\nThe structural characteristics of a community of practice are again redefined to a domain of knowledge, a notion of community and a practice.\n\n; Domain\n:A domain of knowledge creates common ground, inspires members to participate, guides their learning and gives meaning to their actions.\n\n; Community\n:The notion of a community creates the social fabric for that learning.  A strong community fosters interactions and encourages a willingness to share ideas.\n\n; Practice\n:While the domain provides the general area of interest for the community, the practice is the specific focus around which the community develops, shares and maintains its core of knowledge.\n\nIn many organizations, communities of practice have become an integral part of the organization structure {{Harv|McDermott|Archibald|2010}}. These communities take on knowledge stewarding tasks that were formerly covered by more formal organizational structures. In some organizations there are both formal and informal communities of practice. There is a great deal of interest within organizations to encourage, support, and sponsor communities of practice in order to benefit from shared knowledge that may lead to higher productivity {{Harv|Wenger|2004}}. Communities of practice are now viewed by many in the business setting as a means to capturing the [[tacit knowledge]], or the know-how that is not so easily articulated.\n\nAn important aspect and function of communities of practice is increasing organization performance. {{Harvtxt|Lesser|Storck|2001|p=836}} identify four areas of organizational performance that can be affected by communities of practice: \n* Decreasing the learning curve of new employees\n* Responding more rapidly to customer needs and inquiries\n* Reducing rework and preventing \"reinvention of the wheel\"\n* Spawning new ideas for products and services\n\n== Examples ==\n\nThe communities Lave and Wenger studied were naturally forming as practitioners of craft and skill-based activities met to share experiences and insights {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\nLave and Wenger observed situated learning within a community of practice among Yucat\u00e1n midwives, Liberian tailors, navy quartermasters and meat cutters {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}} as well as insurance claims processors. {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}. Other fields have made use of the concept of CoPs. Examples include education {{Harv|Grossman|2001}}, sociolinguistics, material anthropology, [[medical education]], [[second language acquisition]] {{Harv|Kimble|Hildreth|Bourdon|2008}}, Parliamentary Budget Offices {{Harv|Chohan|2013}}, health care and business sectors,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Linda C |last2=Grimshaw |first2=Jeremy M |last3=Nielsen |first3=Camilla |last4=Judd |first4=Maria |last5=Coyte |first5=Peter C |last6=Graham |first6=Ian D |title=Use of communities of practice in business and health care sectors: A systematic review |journal=Implementation Science |date=17 May 2009 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=27 |doi=10.1186/1748-5908-4-27|pmid=19445723 |pmc=2694761 }}</ref> and child mental health practice ([[Adolescent Mentalization-Based Integrative Treatment|AMBIT]]).\n\nA famous example of a community of practice within an organization is that which developed around the Xerox customer service representatives who repaired the machines in the field {{Harv|Brown|Duguid|2000}}. The Xerox reps began exchanging tips and tricks over informal meetings over breakfast or lunch and eventually Xerox saw the value of these interactions and created the Eureka project to allow these interactions to be shared across the global network of representatives. The Eureka database has been estimated to have saved the corporation $100 million.\n\n===Compared to functional or project teams===\nCollaboration constellations differ in various ways. Some are under organizational control (e.g., teams, see below) others, like CoPs, are self-organized or under the control of individuals. For examples of how these and other collaboration types vary in terms of their temporal or boundary focus and the basis of their members' relationships, see {{Harvtxt|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}}.\n\nA [[project team]] differs from a community of practice in several significant ways {{harv|McDermott|1999}}. \n* A [[project team]] is driven by deliverables with shared goals, milestones and results.\n* A project team meets to share and exchange information and experiences just as the community of practice does, but team membership is defined by task.\n* A project team typically has designated members who remain consistent in their roles during the project.\n* A project team is dissolved once its mission is accomplished.\n\nBy contrast,\n* A community of practice is often organically created, with as many objectives as members of that community.\n* Community membership is defined by the knowledge of the members. CoP membership changes and members may take on new roles within the community as interests and needs arise.\n* A community of practice can exist as long as the members believe they have something to contribute to it, or gain from it.\n\n===Versus communities of interest===\nIn addition to the distinction between CoP and other types of organizational groupings found in the workplace, in some cases it is useful to differentiate CoP from [[community of interest]] (CoI).\n\n'''Community of interest'''\n* A group of people interested in sharing information and discussing a particular topic that interests them.\n* Members are not necessarily experts or practitioners of the topic around which the CoI has formed.\n* The purpose of the CoI is to provide a place where people who share a common interest can go and exchange information, ask questions, and express their opinions about the topic.\n* Membership in a CoI is not dependent upon expertise \u2013 one only needs to be interested in the subject.\n\n'''Community of practice'''\n* A CoP, in contrast, is a group of people who are active practitioners.\n* CoP participation is not appropriate for non-practitioners.\n* The purpose of a CoP, as discussed above, is to provide a way for practitioners to share tips and best practices, ask questions of their colleagues, and provide support for each other.\n* Membership is dependent on expertise \u2013 one should have at least some recent experience performing in the role or subject area of the CoP.\n* Example: Someone who is interested in photography and has some background/training in it finds an online CoP for working photojournalists, who use it to discuss various aspects of their work. Since this community is focused on working photojournalists, it would not be appropriate for an amateur photographer to contribute to the CoP discussions there. Depending on the CoP's structure, non-CoP members may have access to reading the discussions and accessing other materials of the community.\n\n== Benefits ==\n\n===Social capital===\n[[Social capital]] is said to be a multi-dimensional concept, with both public and private facets (Bourdieu 1991).<ref>Bourdieu, P. (1991). Language and symbolic power. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press</ref> That is, social capital may provide value to both the individual and the group as a whole. Through informal connections that participants build in their community of practice, and in the process of sharing their expertise, learning from others, and participating in the group, members are said to be acquiring [[social capital]] \u2013 especially those members who demonstrate expertise and experience.\n\n=== Knowledge management ===\n{{Harvtxt|Wasko|Faraj|2000}} describe three kinds of knowledge: \"knowledge as object\", \"knowledge embedded within individuals\", and \"knowledge embedded in a community\".<ref>Wasko, M.; Faraj, S. (2000). \"\"It is what one does\": why people participate and help others in electronic communities of practice\". Journal of Strategic Information Systems. 9 (2-3): 155\u2013173. doi:10.1016/S0963-8687(00)00045-7</ref> Communities of Practice have become associated with finding, sharing, transferring, and archiving knowledge, as well as making explicit \"expertise\", or [[tacit knowledge]]. Tacit knowledge is considered to be those valuable context-based experiences that cannot easily be captured, codified and stored {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}, also {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.\n\nBecause [[knowledge management]] is seen \"primarily as a problem of capturing, organizing, and retrieving information, evoking notions of databases, documents, query languages, and data mining\" {{Harv|Thomas|Kellogg|Erickson|2001}}, the community of practice, collectively and individually, is considered a rich potential source of helpful information in the form of actual experiences; in other words, [[best practices]].\n\nThus, for knowledge management, a community of practice is one source of content and context that if codified, documented and archived can be accessed for later use.\n\n== Factors ==\n\n===Individuals===\nMembers of communities of practice are thought to be more efficient and effective conduits of information and experiences. While organizations tend to provide manuals to meet the training needs of their employees, CoPs help foster the process of storytelling among colleagues which, in turn, helps them strengthen their skills on the job {{Harv|Seely Brown|Duguid|1991}}.\n\nStudies have shown that workers spend a third of their time looking for information and are five times more likely to turn to a co-worker rather than an explicit source of information (book, manual, or database) {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}. Time is saved by conferring with members of a CoP.  Members of the community have [[tacit knowledge]], which can be difficult to store and retrieve outside.  For example, one person can share the best way to handle a situation based on his experiences, which may enable the other person to avoid mistakes and shorten the learning curve.  In a CoP, members can openly discuss and brainstorm about a project, which can lead to new capabilities. The type of information that is shared and learned in a CoP is boundless {{Harv|Dalkir|2005}}. {{Harvtxt|Duguid|2005}} clarifies the difference between [[tacit knowledge]], or knowing ''how'', and [[explicit knowledge]], or knowing ''what''. Performing optimally in a job requires being able to convert theory into practice. Communities of practice help the individual bridge the gap between knowing ''what'' and knowing ''how'' {{Harv|Duguid|2005}}.\n\nAs members of communities of practice, individuals report increased communication with people (professionals, interested parties, hobbyists), less dependence on geographic proximity, and the generation of new knowledge {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}.\n\n====Social presence====\nCommunicating with others in a community of practice involves creating ''social presence''. {{harvtxt|Tu|2002}} defines social presence as \"the degree of salience of another person in an interaction and the consequent salience of an interpersonal relationship\" (p.&nbsp;38). It is believed that social presence affects how likely an individual is of participating in a CoP (especially in online environments) {{Harv|Tu|2002}}. Management of a community of practice often faces many barriers that inhibit individuals from engaging in knowledge exchange. Some of the reasons for these barriers are egos and personal attacks, large overwhelming CoPs, and time constraints {{Harv|Wasko|Faraj|2000}}.\n\n====Motivation====\nMotivation to share knowledge is critical to success in communities of practice. Studies show that members are motivated to become active participants in a CoP when they view knowledge as meant for the public good, a moral obligation and/or as a community interest {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}. Members of a community of practice can also be motivated to participate by using methods such as tangible returns (promotion, raises or bonuses), intangible returns (reputation, self-esteem) and community interest (exchange of practice related knowledge, interaction).\n\n====Collaboration====\nCollaboration is essential to ensuring that communities of practice thrive. Research has found that certain factors can indicate a higher level of collaboration in knowledge exchange in a business network {{Harv|Sveiby|Simon|2002}}. Sveiby and Simons found that more seasoned colleagues tend to foster a more collaborative culture. Additionally they noted that a higher educational level also predicts a tendency to favor collaboration.\n\n== Cultivating successful CoPs ==\n{{see also|Motivations for online participation}}\n\nWhat makes a community of practice succeed depends on the purpose and objective of the community as well as the interests and resources of the members of that community. Wenger identified seven actions that could be taken in order to cultivate communities of practice:\n\n# Design the community to evolve naturally \u2013 Because the nature of a community of practice is dynamic, in that the interests, goals, and members are subject to change, CoP forums should be designed to support shifts in focus.\n# Create opportunities for open dialog within and with outside perspectives \u2013 While the members and their knowledge are the CoP's most valuable resource, it is also beneficial to look outside of the CoP to understand the different possibilities for achieving their learning goals.\n# Welcome and allow different levels of participation \u2013 Wenger identifies 3 main levels of participation. 1) The core group who participate intensely in the community through discussions and projects. This group typically takes on leadership roles in guiding the group 2) The active group who attend and participate regularly, but not to the level of the leaders. 3) The peripheral group who, while they are passive participants in the community, still learn from their level of involvement. Wenger notes the third group typically represents the majority of the community.\n# Develop both public and private community spaces \u2013 While CoPs typically operate in public spaces where all members share, discuss and explore ideas, they should also offer private exchanges. Different members of the CoP could coordinate relationships among members and resources in an individualized approach based on specific needs.\n# Focus on the value of the community \u2013 CoPs should create opportunities for participants to explicitly discuss the value and productivity of their participation in the group.\n# Combine familiarity and excitement \u2013 CoPs should offer the expected learning opportunities as part of their structure, and opportunities for members to shape their learning experience together by brainstorming and examining the conventional and radical wisdom related to their topic.\n# Find and nurture a regular rhythm for the community \u2013 CoPs should coordinate a thriving cycle of activities and events that allow for the members to regularly meet, reflect, and evolve. The rhythm, or pace, should maintain an anticipated level of engagement to sustain the vibrancy of the community, yet not be so fast-paced that it becomes unwieldy and overwhelming in its intensity {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Adaptive management]]\n* [[Discourse community]]\n* [[Distributed leadership]]\n* [[Duality (CoPs)]]\n* [[Guild]]\n* [[Knowledge transfer]]\n* [[Knowledge tagging]]\n* [[Learning community]]\n* [[Learning organization]]\n* [[Network of practice]]\n* [[Organizational learning]]\n* [[Personal network]]\n* [[Professional learning community]]\n* [[Social environment]]\n* [[Situated cognition]]\n* [[Situated learning]]\n* [[Value network]]\n* [[Value network analysis]]\n* [[Virtual community of practice]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | doi=10.1108/13673270310463626 | ref=harv\n | last1=Ardichvilli | first1=Alexander\n | last2=Page | first2=Vaughn\n | last3=Wentling | first3=Tim\n | year=2003\n | title=Motivation and barriers to participation in virtual knowledge sharing in communities of practice\n | journal=Journal of Knowledge Management\n | volume=7 | issue=1\n | pages=64\u201377\n| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04d5387684ab24c90c684c364a08d24ec0ba9853\n }}\n*{{cite book | title=Language and symbolic power | url=https://archive.org/details/languagesymbolic0000bour_1991 | url-access=registration | publisher=Harvard University Press. | author=Bourdieu, P. | year=1991 | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}\n* {{cite journal | ref=harv\n | last1=Brown | first1=John Seely\n | last2=Duguid | first2=Paul\n | year=2000\n | title=Balancing act: How to capture knowledge without killing it\n | journal=Harvard Business Review\n | volume= | issue=\n | url=http://lymabe.edublogs.org/files/2007/04/balancing-act.doc\n}}\n* {{cite journal | doi=10.1177/0165551505057016 | ref=harv\n | last1=Cox| first1=Andrew\n | year=2005\n | title=What are communities of practice?

The concept was first proposed by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Jean Lave]] and educational theorist [[Etienne Wenger]] in their 1991 book ''Situated Learning'' {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book ''Communities of Practice'' {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}.\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunch room at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) {{Harv|Dub\u00e9|Bourhis|Jacob|2005}} when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance{{Harv|Sheridan|2015}}. A \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) {{Harv|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}} is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [[American pragmatism]], especially [[C. S. Peirce]]'s concept of the \"[[community of inquiry]]\" {{harv|Shields|2003}}, but also [[John Dewey]]'s principle of learning through occupation {{harv|Wallace|2007}}.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n===Origin and development===\nSince the publication of \"Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation\" {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}, communities of practice have been the focus of attention, first as a theory of learning and later as part of the field of knowledge management. See {{Harvtxt|Hildreth|Kimble|2004|}} for a review of how the concept has changed over the years. {{Harvtxt|Cox|2005}} offers a more critical view of the different ways in which the term communities of practice can be interpreted.\n\n====Early years====\nTo understand how learning occurs outside the classroom while at the [[Institute for Research on Learning]], Lave and Wenger studied how newcomers or novices to informal groups become established members of those groups {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Lave and Wenger first used the term communities of practice to describe learning through practice and participation, which they named [[situated learning]].\n\nThe structure of the community was created over time through a process of [[legitimate peripheral participation]]. Legitimation and participation together define the characteristic ways of belonging to a community whereas peripherality and participation are concerned with location and identity in the social world {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991|p= 29}}.\n\nLave and Wenger's research looked at how apprenticeships help people learn. They found that when newcomers join an established group or community, they spend some time initially observing and perhaps performing simple tasks in basic roles as they learn how the group works and how they can participate (an apprentice electrician, for example would watch and learn before actually doing any electrical work; initially taking on small simple jobs and eventually more complicated ones). Lave and Wenger described this socialization process as legitimate peripheral participation. The term \"community of practice\" is that group that Lave and Wenger referred to, who share a common interest and a desire to learn from and contribute to the community with their variety of experiences {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\n====Later years====\nIn his later work, {{Harvtxt|Wenger|1998}} abandoned the concept of legitimate peripheral participation and used the idea of an inherent tension in a [[Duality (CoPs)|duality]] instead.  He identifies four dualities that exist in communities of practice, participation-reification, designed-emergent, identification-negotiability and local-global, although the participation-reification duality has been the focus of particular interest because of its links to [[knowledge management]].\n\nHe describes the structure of a CoP as consisting of three interrelated terms: '[[mutual engagement]]', 'joint enterprise' and 'shared repertoire' {{Harv|Wenger|1998|pp= 72\u201373}}.\n\n* Mutual Engagement: Firstly, through participation in the community, members establish norms and build collaborative relationships; this is termed mutual engagement.  These relationships are the ties that bind the members of the community together as a social entity.\n* Joint Enterprise: Secondly, through their interactions, they create a shared understanding of what binds them together; this is termed the joint enterprise.  The joint enterprise is (re)negotiated by its members and is sometimes referred to as the 'domain' of the community.\n* Shared Repertoire: Finally, as part of its practice, the community produces a set of communal resources, which is termed their shared repertoire; this is used in the pursuit of their joint enterprise and can include both literal and symbolic meanings.\n\n====Present work====\nFor [[Etienne Wenger]], [[learning]] is central to human [[identity (social science)|identity]]. A primary focus of Wenger's more recent work is on learning as social participation \u2013 the individual as an active participant in the practices of social communities, and in the construction of his/her identity through these communities {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}. In this context, a community of practice is a group of individuals participating in communal activity, and experiencing/continuously creating their shared identity through engaging in and contributing to the practices of their communities.\n\nThe structural characteristics of a community of practice are again redefined to a domain of knowledge, a notion of community and a practice.\n\n; Domain\n:A domain of knowledge creates common ground, inspires members to participate, guides their learning and gives meaning to their actions.\n\n; Community\n:The notion of a community creates the social fabric for that learning.  A strong community fosters interactions and encourages a willingness to share ideas.\n\n; Practice\n:While the domain provides the general area of interest for the community, the practice is the specific focus around which the community develops, shares and maintains its core of knowledge.\n\nIn many organizations, communities of practice have become an integral part of the organization structure {{Harv|McDermott|Archibald|2010}}. These communities take on knowledge stewarding tasks that were formerly covered by more formal organizational structures. In some organizations there are both formal and informal communities of practice. There is a great deal of interest within organizations to encourage, support, and sponsor communities of practice in order to benefit from shared knowledge that may lead to higher productivity {{Harv|Wenger|2004}}. Communities of practice are now viewed by many in the business setting as a means to capturing the [[tacit knowledge]], or the know-how that is not so easily articulated.\n\nAn important aspect and function of communities of practice is increasing organization performance. {{Harvtxt|Lesser|Storck|2001|p=836}} identify four areas of organizational performance that can be affected by communities of practice: \n* Decreasing the learning curve of new employees\n* Responding more rapidly to customer needs and inquiries\n* Reducing rework and preventing \"reinvention of the wheel\"\n* Spawning new ideas for products and services\n\n== Examples ==\n\nThe communities Lave and Wenger studied were naturally forming as practitioners of craft and skill-based activities met to share experiences and insights {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\nLave and Wenger observed situated learning within a community of practice among Yucat\u00e1n midwives, Liberian tailors, navy quartermasters and meat cutters {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}} as well as insurance claims processors. {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}. Other fields have made use of the concept of CoPs. Examples include education {{Harv|Grossman|2001}}, sociolinguistics, material anthropology, [[medical education]], [[second language acquisition]] {{Harv|Kimble|Hildreth|Bourdon|2008}}, Parliamentary Budget Offices {{Harv|Chohan|2013}}, health care and business sectors,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Linda C |last2=Grimshaw |first2=Jeremy M |last3=Nielsen |first3=Camilla |last4=Judd |first4=Maria |last5=Coyte |first5=Peter C |last6=Graham |first6=Ian D |title=Use of communities of practice in business and health care sectors: A systematic review |journal=Implementation Science |date=17 May 2009 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=27 |doi=10.1186/1748-5908-4-27|pmid=19445723 |pmc=2694761 }}</ref> and child mental health practice ([[Adolescent Mentalization-Based Integrative Treatment|AMBIT]]).\n\nA famous example of a community of practice within an organization is that which developed around the Xerox customer service representatives who repaired the machines in the field {{Harv|Brown|Duguid|2000}}. The Xerox reps began exchanging tips and tricks over informal meetings over breakfast or lunch and eventually Xerox saw the value of these interactions and created the Eureka project to allow these interactions to be shared across the global network of representatives. The Eureka database has been estimated to have saved the corporation $100 million.\n\n===Compared to functional or project teams===\nCollaboration constellations differ in various ways. Some are under organizational control (e.g., teams, see below) others, like CoPs, are self-organized or under the control of individuals. For examples of how these and other collaboration types vary in terms of their temporal or boundary focus and the basis of their members' relationships, see {{Harvtxt|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}}.\n\nA [[project team]] differs from a community of practice in several significant ways {{harv|McDermott|1999}}. \n* A [[project team]] is driven by deliverables with shared goals, milestones and results.\n* A project team meets to share and exchange information and experiences just as the community of practice does, but team membership is defined by task.\n* A project team typically has designated members who remain consistent in their roles during the project.\n* A project team is dissolved once its mission is accomplished.\n\nBy contrast,\n* A community of practice is often organically created, with as many objectives as members of that community.\n* Community membership is defined by the knowledge of the members. CoP membership changes and members may take on new roles within the community as interests and needs arise.\n* A community of practice can exist as long as the members believe they have something to contribute to it, or gain from it.\n\n===Versus communities of interest===\nIn addition to the distinction between CoP and other types of organizational groupings found in the workplace, in some cases it is useful to differentiate CoP from [[community of interest]] (CoI).\n\n'''Community of interest'''\n* A group of people interested in sharing information and discussing a particular topic that interests them.\n* Members are not necessarily experts or practitioners of the topic around which the CoI has formed.\n* The purpose of the CoI is to provide a place where people who share a common interest can go and exchange information, ask questions, and express their opinions about the topic.\n* Membership in a CoI is not dependent upon expertise \u2013 one only needs to be interested in the subject.\n\n'''Community of practice'''\n* A CoP, in contrast, is a group of people who are active practitioners.\n* CoP participation is not appropriate for non-practitioners.\n* The purpose of a CoP, as discussed above, is to provide a way for practitioners to share tips and best practices, ask questions of their colleagues, and provide support for each other.\n* Membership is dependent on expertise \u2013 one should have at least some recent experience performing in the role or subject area of the CoP.\n* Example: Someone who is interested in photography and has some background/training in it finds an online CoP for working photojournalists, who use it to discuss various aspects of their work. Since this community is focused on working photojournalists, it would not be appropriate for an amateur photographer to contribute to the CoP discussions there. Depending on the CoP's structure, non-CoP members may have access to reading the discussions and accessing other materials of the community.\n\n== Benefits ==\n\n===Social capital===\n[[Social capital]] is said to be a multi-dimensional concept, with both public and private facets (Bourdieu 1991).<ref>Bourdieu, P. (1991). Language and symbolic power. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press</ref> That is, social capital may provide value to both the individual and the group as a whole. Through informal connections that participants build in their community of practice, and in the process of sharing their expertise, learning from others, and participating in the group, members are said to be acquiring [[social capital]] \u2013 especially those members who demonstrate expertise and experience.\n\n=== Knowledge management ===\n{{Harvtxt|Wasko|Faraj|2000}} describe three kinds of knowledge: \"knowledge as object\", \"knowledge embedded within individuals\", and \"knowledge embedded in a community\".<ref>Wasko, M.; Faraj, S. (2000). \"\"It is what one does\": why people participate and help others in electronic communities of practice\". Journal of Strategic Information Systems. 9 (2-3): 155\u2013173. doi:10.1016/S0963-8687(00)00045-7</ref> Communities of Practice have become associated with finding, sharing, transferring, and archiving knowledge, as well as making explicit \"expertise\", or [[tacit knowledge]]. Tacit knowledge is considered to be those valuable context-based experiences that cannot easily be captured, codified and stored {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}, also {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.\n\nBecause [[knowledge management]] is seen \"primarily as a problem of capturing, organizing, and retrieving information, evoking notions of databases, documents, query languages, and data mining\" {{Harv|Thomas|Kellogg|Erickson|2001}}, the community of practice, collectively and individually, is considered a rich potential source of helpful information in the form of actual experiences; in other words, [[best practices]].\n\nThus, for knowledge management, a community of practice is one source of content and context that if codified, documented and archived can be accessed for later use.\n\n== Factors ==\n\n===Individuals===\nMembers of communities of practice are thought to be more efficient and effective conduits of information and experiences. While organizations tend to provide manuals to meet the training needs of their employees, CoPs help foster the process of storytelling among colleagues which, in turn, helps them strengthen their skills on the job {{Harv|Seely Brown|Duguid|1991}}.\n\nStudies have shown that workers spend a third of their time looking for information and are five times more likely to turn to a co-worker rather than an explicit source of information (book, manual, or database) {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}. Time is saved by conferring with members of a CoP.  Members of the community have [[tacit knowledge]], which can be difficult to store and retrieve outside.  For example, one person can share the best way to handle a situation based on his experiences, which may enable the other person to avoid mistakes and shorten the learning curve.  In a CoP, members can openly discuss and brainstorm about a project, which can lead to new capabilities. The type of information that is shared and learned in a CoP is boundless {{Harv|Dalkir|2005}}. {{Harvtxt|Duguid|2005}} clarifies the difference between [[tacit knowledge]], or knowing ''how'', and [[explicit knowledge]], or knowing ''what''. Performing optimally in a job requires being able to convert theory into practice. Communities of practice help the individual bridge the gap between knowing ''what'' and knowing ''how'' {{Harv|Duguid|2005}}.\n\nAs members of communities of practice, individuals report increased communication with people (professionals, interested parties, hobbyists), less dependence on geographic proximity, and the generation of new knowledge {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}.\n\n====Social presence====\nCommunicating with others in a community of practice involves creating ''social presence''. {{harvtxt|Tu|2002}} defines social presence as \"the degree of salience of another person in an interaction and the consequent salience of an interpersonal relationship\" (p.&nbsp;38). It is believed that social presence affects how likely an individual is of participating in a CoP (especially in online environments) {{Harv|Tu|2002}}. Management of a community of practice often faces many barriers that inhibit individuals from engaging in knowledge exchange. Some of the reasons for these barriers are egos and personal attacks, large overwhelming CoPs, and time constraints {{Harv|Wasko|Faraj|2000}}.\n\n====Motivation====\nMotivation to share knowledge is critical to success in communities of practice. Studies show that members are motivated to become active participants in a CoP when they view knowledge as meant for the public good, a moral obligation and/or as a community interest {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}. Members of a community of practice can also be motivated to participate by using methods such as tangible returns (promotion, raises or bonuses), intangible returns (reputation, self-esteem) and community interest (exchange of practice related knowledge, interaction).\n\n====Collaboration====\nCollaboration is essential to ensuring that communities of practice thrive. Research has found that certain factors can indicate a higher level of collaboration in knowledge exchange in a business network {{Harv|Sveiby|Simon|2002}}. Sveiby and Simons found that more seasoned colleagues tend to foster a more collaborative culture. Additionally they noted that a higher educational level also predicts a tendency to favor collaboration.\n\n== Cultivating successful CoPs ==\n{{see also|Motivations for online participation}}\n\nWhat makes a community of practice succeed depends on the purpose and objective of the community as well as the interests and resources of the members of that community. Wenger identified seven actions that could be taken in order to cultivate communities of practice:\n\n# Design the community to evolve naturally \u2013 Because the nature of a community of practice is dynamic, in that the interests, goals, and members are subject to change, CoP forums should be designed to support shifts in focus.\n# Create opportunities for open dialog within and with outside perspectives \u2013 While the members and their knowledge are the CoP's most valuable resource, it is also beneficial to look outside of the CoP to understand the different possibilities for achieving their learning goals.\n# Welcome and allow different levels of participation \u2013 Wenger identifies 3 main levels of participation. 1) The core group who participate intensely in the community through discussions and projects. This group typically takes on leadership roles in guiding the group 2) The active group who attend and participate regularly, but not to the level of the leaders. 3) The peripheral group who, while they are passive participants in the community, still learn from their level of involvement. Wenger notes the third group typically represents the majority of the community.\n# Develop both public and private community spaces \u2013 While CoPs typically operate in public spaces where all members share, discuss and explore ideas, they should also offer private exchanges. Different members of the CoP could coordinate relationships among members and resources in an individualized approach based on specific needs.\n# Focus on the value of the community \u2013 CoPs should create opportunities for participants to explicitly discuss the value and productivity of their participation in the group.\n# Combine familiarity and excitement \u2013 CoPs should offer the expected learning opportunities as part of their structure, and opportunities for members to shape their learning experience together by brainstorming and examining the conventional and radical wisdom related to their topic.\n# Find and nurture a regular rhythm for the community \u2013 CoPs should coordinate a thriving cycle of activities and events that allow for the members to regularly meet, reflect, and evolve. The rhythm, or pace, should maintain an anticipated level of engagement to sustain the vibrancy of the community, yet not be so fast-paced that it becomes unwieldy and overwhelming in its intensity {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Adaptive management]]\n* [[Discourse community]]\n* [[Distributed leadership]]\n* [[Duality (CoPs)]]\n* [[Guild]]\n* [[Knowledge transfer]]\n* [[Knowledge tagging]]\n* [[Learning community]]\n* [[Learning organization]]\n* [[Network of practice]]\n* [[Organizational learning]]\n* [[Personal network]]\n* [[Professional learning community]]\n* [[Social environment]]\n* [[Situated cognition]]\n* [[Situated learning]]\n* [[Value network]]\n* [[Value network analysis]]\n* [[Virtual community of practice]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | doi=10.1108/13673270310463626 | ref=harv\n | last1=Ardichvilli | first1=Alexander\n | last2=Page | first2=Vaughn\n | last3=Wentling | first3=Tim\n | year=2003\n | title=Motivation and barriers to participation in virtual knowledge sharing in communities of practice\n | journal=Journal of Knowledge Management\n | volume=7 | issue=1\n | pages=64\u201377\n| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04d5387684ab24c90c684c364a08d24ec0ba9853\n }}\n*{{cite book | title=Language and symbolic power | url=https://archive.org/details/languagesymbolic0000bour_1991 | url-access=registration | publisher=Harvard University Press. | author=Bourdieu, P. | year=1991 | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}\n* {{cite journal | ref=harv\n | last1=Brown | first1=John Seely\n | last2=Duguid | first2=Paul\n | year=2000\n | title=Balancing act: How to capture knowledge without killing it\n | journal=Harvard Business Review\n | volume= | issue=\n | url=http://lymabe.edublogs.org/files/2007/04/balancing-act.doc\n}}\n* {{cite journal | doi=10.1177/0165551505057016 | ref=harv\n | last1=Cox| first1=Andrew\n | year=2005\n | title=What are communities of practice?

One of the stars of this association, [[NML Cygni]], is one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest stars currently known]]. The constellation is also home to [[Cygnus X-1]], a distant X-ray binary containing a supergiant and unseen massive companion that was the first object widely held to be a [[black hole]]. Many star systems in Cygnus have known planets as a result of the [[Kepler Mission]] observing one patch of the sky, an area around Cygnus. In addition, most of the eastern part of Cygnus is dominated by the [[Hercules\u2013Corona Borealis Great Wall]], a giant [[galaxy filament]] that is the largest known structure in the observable universe, covering most of the northern sky.\n\n== History and mythology ==\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Lacerta, Cygnus, Lyra, Vulpecula and Anser.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cygnus as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. Surrounding it are Lacerta, Vulpecula and Lyra.]]\n\n=== In Greek astronomy ===\nIn [[Greek mythology]], Cygnus has been identified with several different legendary swans. [[Zeus]] disguised himself as a swan to seduce [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], [[Sparta]]n king [[Tyndareus]]'s wife, who gave birth to the [[Castor and Pollux|Gemini]], [[Helen of Troy]], and [[Clytemnestra]];{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134\u2013137}} [[Orpheus]] was transformed into a swan after his murder, and was said to have been placed in the sky next to his [[lyre]] ([[Lyra]]); and the King [[Cycnus|Cygnus]] was transformed into a swan.\n\nThe Greeks also associated this constellation with the tragic story of [[Phaethon]], the son of [[Helios]] the sun god, who demanded to ride his father's sun chariot for a day.  Phaethon, however, was unable to control the reins, forcing Zeus to destroy the chariot (and Phaethon) with a thunderbolt, causing it to plummet to the earth into the river [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].  According to the myth, Phaethon's close friend or lover, Cygnus, grieved bitterly and spent many days diving into the river to collect Phaethon's bones to give him a proper burial.  The gods were so touched by Cygnus's devotion that they turned him into a swan and placed him among the stars.<ref>P.K. Chen (2007)'' A Constellation Album: Stars and Mythology of the Night Sky'', p. 70 ({{ISBN|978-1-931559-38-6}}).</ref>\n\nIn [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', there are three people named Cygnus, all of whom are transformed into swans. Alongside Cygnus, noted above, he mentions a boy from [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe]] who commits suicide when [[Phyllius]] refuses to give him a tamed bull that he demands, but is transformed into a swan and flies away. He also mentions a son of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] who is an invulnerable warrior in the [[Trojan War]] who is eventually defeated by [[Achilles]], but Neptune saves him by transforming him into a swan.\n\nTogether with other [[bird|avian]] constellations near the [[summer solstice]], [[Lyra#History|Vultur cadens]] and [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], Cygnus may be a significant part of the origin of the myth of the [[Stymphalian Birds]], one of [[The Twelve Labours]] of [[Hercules]].<ref>Allen (1963) p. 56.</ref>\n\n=== In World Astronomy ===\n''See also: [[Cygnus in Chinese astronomy]]''\n\nIn [[Hinduism]], the period of time (or  [[Muhurta]]) between  4:24 AM to 5:12 AM is called the [[Brahmamuhurtha]], which means \"the moment of the Universe\"; the star system in correlation is the Cygnus constellation. This is believed to be a highly auspicious time to meditate, do any task, or start the day.\n \nIn [[Polynesia]], Cygnus was often recognized as a separate constellation. In [[Tonga]] it was called ''Tuula-lupe'', and in the [[Tuamotus]] it was called ''Fanui-tai''.  In [[New Zealand]] it was called ''Mara-tea'', in the [[Society Islands]] it was called ''Pirae-tea'' or ''Taurua-i-te-haapa-raa-manu'', and in the Tuamotus it was called ''Fanui-raro''. Beta Cygni was named in New Zealand; it was likely called ''Whetu-kaupo''. Gamma Cygni was called ''Fanui-runga'' in the Tuamotus.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=282}}\n\nDeneb was also often a given name, in [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|the Islamic world of astronomy]]. The name ''Deneb'' comes from the [[Arabic]] name ''dhaneb'', meaning \"tail\", from the phrase ''Dhanab ad-Daj\u0101jah'', which means \u201cthe tail of the hen\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/cygnus-constellation/ |title=Cygnus Constellation: Facts, Myth, Star Map, Major Stars, Deep Sky Objects - Constellation Guide |website=Constellation Guide}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nA very large constellation, Cygnus is bordered by Cepheus to the north and east, Draco to the north and west, Lyra to the west, Vulpecula to the south, Pegasus to the southeast and Lacerta to the east.

The brightest of these are two gold-hued stars, which represent the bottom of the toy it is named for. A larger amateur instrument reveals 8 more stars, nebulosity to the east and west of the cluster, and a diameter of 9 arcminutes. The nebulosity in this region is part of the Gamma Cygni Nebula. The other stars, approximately 3700 light-years from Earth, are mostly blue-white and very hot.<ref name=\"S&T\" />\n\nOther open clusters in Cygnus include [[Dolidze 9]], [[Collinder 421]], [[Dolidze 11]], and [[Berkeley 90]]. Dolidze 9, 2800 light-years from Earth and relatively young at 20 million light-years old, is a faint open cluster with up to 22 stars visible in small and medium-sized amateur telescopes. Nebulosity is visible to the north and east of the cluster, which is 7 arcminutes in diameter. The brightest star appears in the eastern part of the cluster and is of the 7th magnitude; another bright star has a yellow hue. Dolidze 11 is an open cluster 400 million years old, farthest away of the three at 3700 light-years. More than 10 stars are visible in an amateur instrument in this cluster, of similar size to Dolidze 9 at 7 arcminutes in diameter, whose brightest star is of magnitude 7.5. It, too, has nebulosity in the east. Collinder 421 is a particularly old open cluster at an age of approximately 1 billion years; it is of magnitude 10.1. 3100 light-years from Earth, more than 30 stars are visible in a diameter of 8 arcseconds. The prominent star in the north of the cluster has a golden color, whereas the stars in the south of the cluster appear orange. Collinder 421 appears to be embedded in nebulosity, which extends past the cluster's borders to its west. Berkeley 90 is a smaller open cluster, with a diameter of 5 arcminutes.

[[DWB 87]] is another of the many bright emission nebulae in Cygnus, 7.8 by 4.3 arcminutes. It is in the Gamma Cygni area. Two other emission nebulae include [[Sharpless 2-112]] and [[Sharpless 2-115]]. When viewed in an amateur telescope, Sharpless 2\u2013112 appears to be in a teardrop shape. More of the nebula's eastern portion is visible with an [[O III]] (doubly ionized oxygen) filter. There is an orange star of magnitude 10 nearby and a star of magnitude 9 near the nebula's northwest edge. Further to the northwest, there is a dark rift and another bright patch. The whole nebula measures 15 arcminutes in diameter. Sharpless 2\u2013115 is another emission nebula with a complex pattern of light and dark patches. Two pairs of stars appear in the nebula; it is larger near the southwestern pair. The open cluster Berkeley 90 is embedded in this large nebula, which measures 30 by 20 arcminutes.<ref name=\"S&T\" />\n\nAlso of note is the [[Crescent Nebula]] (NGC 6888), located between Gamma and Eta Cygni, which was formed by the [[Wolf\u2013Rayet star]] [[WR 136|HD 192163]].\n\nIn recent years, amateur astronomers have made some notable Cygnus discoveries.  The \"[[Soap bubble nebula]]\" (PN G75.5+1.7), near the Crescent nebula, was discovered on a digital image by Dave Jurasevich in 2007.  In 2011, Austrian amateur Matthias Kronberger discovered a planetary nebula ([[Kronberger 61]], now nicknamed \"The Soccer Ball\") on old survey photos, confirmed recently in images by the Gemini Observatory; both of these are likely too faint to be detected by eye in a small amateur scope.\n\nBut a much more obscure and relatively 'tiny' object\u2014one which is readily seen in dark skies by amateur telescopes, under good conditions\u2014is the newly discovered nebula (likely reflection type) associated with the star 4 Cygni (HD 183056): an approximately fan-shaped glowing region of several arcminutes' diameter, to the south and west of the fifth-magnitude star.  It was first discovered visually near San Jose, California and publicly reported by amateur astronomer Stephen Waldee in 2007, and was confirmed photographically by Al Howard in 2010.  California amateur astronomer Dana Patchick also says he detected it on the Palomar Observatory survey photos in 2005 but had not published it for others to confirm and analyze at the time of Waldee's first official notices and later 2010 paper.\n\n[[Cygnus-X (star complex)|Cygnus X]] is the largest star-forming region in the Solar neighborhood and includes not only some of the [[Most luminous stars|brightest]] and [[List of most massive stars|most massive]] stars known (such as [[Cygnus OB2-12]]), but also [[Cygnus OB2]], a massive [[stellar association]] classified by some authors as a young [[globular cluster]].\n\nMore [[supernova]]e have been seen in the [[Fireworks Galaxy]] (NGC 6946) than in any other [[galaxy]].\n\n[[Cygnus A]] is the first [[radio galaxy]] discovered; at a distance of 730 million light-years from Earth, it is the closest powerful radio galaxy.

The constellation is also home to [[Cygnus X-1]], a distant X-ray binary containing a supergiant and unseen massive companion that was the first object widely held to be a [[black hole]]. Many star systems in Cygnus have known planets as a result of the [[Kepler Mission]] observing one patch of the sky, an area around Cygnus. In addition, most of the eastern part of Cygnus is dominated by the [[Hercules\u2013Corona Borealis Great Wall]], a giant [[galaxy filament]] that is the largest known structure in the observable universe, covering most of the northern sky.\n\n== History and mythology ==\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Lacerta, Cygnus, Lyra, Vulpecula and Anser.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cygnus as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825.

[[Zeus]] disguised himself as a swan to seduce [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], [[Sparta]]n king [[Tyndareus]]'s wife, who gave birth to the [[Castor and Pollux|Gemini]], [[Helen of Troy]], and [[Clytemnestra]];{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134\u2013137}} [[Orpheus]] was transformed into a swan after his murder, and was said to have been placed in the sky next to his [[lyre]] ([[Lyra]]); and the King [[Cycnus|Cygnus]] was transformed into a swan.\n\nThe Greeks also associated this constellation with the tragic story of [[Phaethon]], the son of [[Helios]] the sun god, who demanded to ride his father's sun chariot for a day.  Phaethon, however, was unable to control the reins, forcing Zeus to destroy the chariot (and Phaethon) with a thunderbolt, causing it to plummet to the earth into the river [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].  According to the myth, Phaethon's close friend or lover, Cygnus, grieved bitterly and spent many days diving into the river to collect Phaethon's bones to give him a proper burial.  The gods were so touched by Cygnus's devotion that they turned him into a swan and placed him among the stars.<ref>P.K. Chen (2007)'' A Constellation Album: Stars and Mythology of the Night Sky'', p. 70 ({{ISBN|978-1-931559-38-6}}).</ref>\n\nIn [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', there are three people named Cygnus, all of whom are transformed into swans. Alongside Cygnus, noted above, he mentions a boy from [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe]] who commits suicide when [[Phyllius]] refuses to give him a tamed bull that he demands, but is transformed into a swan and flies away. He also mentions a son of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] who is an invulnerable warrior in the [[Trojan War]] who is eventually defeated by [[Achilles]], but Neptune saves him by transforming him into a swan.\n\nTogether with other [[bird|avian]] constellations near the [[summer solstice]], [[Lyra#History|Vultur cadens]] and [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], Cygnus may be a significant part of the origin of the myth of the [[Stymphalian Birds]], one of [[The Twelve Labours]] of [[Hercules]].<ref>Allen (1963) p. 56.</ref>\n\n=== In non-western astronomy ===\n''See also: [[Cygnus in Chinese astronomy]]''\n\nIn [[Hinduism]], the period of time (or  [[Muhurta]]) between  4:24 AM to 5:12 AM is called the [[Brahmamuhurtha]], which means \"the moment of the Universe\"; the star system in correlation is the Cygnus constellation. This is believed to be a highly auspicious time to meditate, do any task, or start the day.\n \nIn [[Polynesia]], Cygnus was often recognized as a separate constellation. In [[Tonga]] it was called ''Tuula-lupe'', and in the [[Tuamotus]] it was called ''Fanui-tai''.  In [[New Zealand]] it was called ''Mara-tea'', in the [[Society Islands]] it was called ''Pirae-tea'' or ''Taurua-i-te-haapa-raa-manu'', and in the Tuamotus it was called ''Fanui-raro''.

Some open clusters can be difficult to make out from a rich background of stars.<ref name=\"thompson07\" />\n\n[[Messier 39|M39]] (NGC 7092) is an [[open cluster]] 950 light-years from Earth that is visible to the unaided eye under dark skies. It is loose, with about 30 stars arranged over a wide area; their conformation appears triangular. The brightest stars of M39 are of the 7th magnitude.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134\u2013137}} Another open cluster in Cygnus is [[NGC 6910]], also called the Rocking Horse Cluster, possessing 16 stars with a diameter of 5 arcminutes visible in a small amateur instrument; it is of magnitude 7.4. The brightest of these are two gold-hued stars, which represent the bottom of the toy it is named for. A larger amateur instrument reveals 8 more stars, nebulosity to the east and west of the cluster, and a diameter of 9 arcminutes. The nebulosity in this region is part of the Gamma Cygni Nebula. The other stars, approximately 3700 light-years from Earth, are mostly blue-white and very hot.<ref name=\"S&T\" />\n\nOther open clusters in Cygnus include [[Dolidze 9]], [[Collinder 421]], [[Dolidze 11]], and [[Berkeley 90]]. Dolidze 9, 2800 light-years from Earth and relatively young at 20 million light-years old, is a faint open cluster with up to 22 stars visible in small and medium-sized amateur telescopes. Nebulosity is visible to the north and east of the cluster, which is 7 arcminutes in diameter. The brightest star appears in the eastern part of the cluster and is of the 7th magnitude; another bright star has a yellow hue. Dolidze 11 is an open cluster 400 million years old, farthest away of the three at 3700 light-years. More than 10 stars are visible in an amateur instrument in this cluster, of similar size to Dolidze 9 at 7 arcminutes in diameter, whose brightest star is of magnitude 7.5. It, too, has nebulosity in the east. Collinder 421 is a particularly old open cluster at an age of approximately 1 billion years; it is of magnitude 10.1. 3100 light-years from Earth, more than 30 stars are visible in a diameter of 8 arcseconds. The prominent star in the north of the cluster has a golden color, whereas the stars in the south of the cluster appear orange. Collinder 421 appears to be embedded in nebulosity, which extends past the cluster's borders to its west. Berkeley 90 is a smaller open cluster, with a diameter of 5 arcminutes. More than 16 members appear in an amateur telescope.<ref name=\"S&T\">{{cite journal |title=Guide Me, Cygnus |last=French |first=Sue |pages=58\u201360 |journal=Sky and Telescope |date=September 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[NGC 6826]], the Blinking Planetary Nebula, is a [[planetary nebula]] with a magnitude of 8.5, 3200 light-years from Earth.

However, its characteristic shape is only visible in long-exposure photographs \u2013 it is difficult to observe in telescopes because of its low [[surface brightness]]. It has low surface brightness because it is so large; at its widest, the North America Nebula is 2 degrees across. Illuminated by a hot embedded star of magnitude 6, NGC 7000 is 1500 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134\u2013137}}\n\n[[File:Veil Nebula 2015-08-15 42 30s-ISO1600 AB 42 136-117-185 CVF.jpg|thumb|NGC 6992 (Eastern Veil Nebula - center) and NGC 6960 (Western Veil Nebula - upper right) photographed from a dark site.]]\n\nTo the south of [[Epsilon Cygni]] is the [[Veil Nebula]] (NGC 6960, 6962, 6979, 6992, and 6995), a 5,000-year-old [[supernova remnant]] covering approximately 3 degrees of the sky -<ref name=\"objects\" /> it is over 50 light-years long.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134\u2013137}} Because of its appearance, it is also called the [[Cygnus Loop]].<ref name=\"objects\" /> The Loop is only visible in long-exposure astrophotographs.

[[DWB 87]] is another of the many bright emission nebulae in Cygnus, 7.8 by 4.3 arcminutes. It is in the Gamma Cygni area. Two other emission nebulae include [[Sharpless 2-112]] and [[Sharpless 2-115]]. When viewed in an amateur telescope, Sharpless 2\u2013112 appears to be in a teardrop shape. More of the nebula's eastern portion is visible with an [[O III]] (doubly ionized oxygen) filter. There is an orange star of magnitude 10 nearby and a star of magnitude 9 near the nebula's northwest edge. Further to the northwest, there is a dark rift and another bright patch. The whole nebula measures 15 arcminutes in diameter. Sharpless 2\u2013115 is another emission nebula with a complex pattern of light and dark patches. Two pairs of stars appear in the nebula; it is larger near the southwestern pair. The open cluster Berkeley 90 is embedded in this large nebula, which measures 30 by 20 arcminutes.<ref name=\"S&T\" />\n\nAlso of note is the [[Crescent Nebula]] (NGC 6888), located between Gamma and Eta Cygni, which was formed by the [[Wolf\u2013Rayet star]] [[WR 136|HD 192163]].\n\nIn recent years, amateur astronomers have made some notable Cygnus discoveries.  The \"[[Soap bubble nebula]]\" (PN G75.5+1.7), near the Crescent nebula, was discovered on a digital image by Dave Jurasevich in 2007.  In 2011, Austrian amateur Matthias Kronberger discovered a planetary nebula ([[Kronberger 61]], now nicknamed \"The Soccer Ball\") on old survey photos, confirmed recently in images by the Gemini Observatory; both of these are likely too faint to be detected by eye in a small amateur scope.\n\nBut a much more obscure and relatively 'tiny' object\u2014one which is readily seen in dark skies by amateur telescopes, under good conditions\u2014is the newly discovered nebula (likely reflection type) associated with the star 4 Cygni (HD 183056): an approximately fan-shaped glowing region of several arcminutes' diameter, to the south and west of the fifth-magnitude star.  It was first discovered visually near San Jose, California and publicly reported by amateur astronomer Stephen Waldee in 2007, and was confirmed photographically by Al Howard in 2010.  California amateur astronomer Dana Patchick also says he detected it on the Palomar Observatory survey photos in 2005 but had not published it for others to confirm and analyze at the time of Waldee's first official notices and later 2010 paper.\n\n[[Cygnus-X (star complex)|Cygnus X]] is the largest star-forming region in the Solar neighborhood and includes not only some of the [[Most luminous stars|brightest]] and [[List of most massive stars|most massive]] stars known (such as [[Cygnus OB2-12]]), but also [[Cygnus OB2]], a massive [[stellar association]] classified by some authors as a young [[globular cluster]].\n\nMore [[supernova]]e have been seen in the [[Fireworks Galaxy]] (NGC 6946) than in any other [[galaxy]].\n\n[[Cygnus A]] is the first [[radio galaxy]] discovered; at a distance of 730 million light-years from Earth, it is the closest powerful radio galaxy. In the [[visible spectrum]], it appears as an [[elliptical galaxy]] in a small [[galaxy cluster|cluster]]. It is classified as an [[active galaxy]] because the [[supermassive black hole]] at its [[active galactic nucleus|nucleus]] is accreting matter, which produces two [[astrophysical jet|jets]] of matter from the poles.

The [[Brazil at the 1982 FIFA World Cup#Starting 11|1982 team]], with a midfield of [[S\u00f3crates]], [[Zico]], [[Paulo Roberto Falc\u00e3o|Falc\u00e3o]] and [[\u00c9der Aleixo de Assis|\u00c9der]], is remembered as perhaps the greatest team never to win a World Cup.<ref name=\"Mirror.co.uk\"/>\n\nSeveral players, including S\u00f3crates and Zico, from 1982 returned to play at the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico. Brazil, still a very good team and more disciplined defensively than four years earlier, met the [[Michel Platini]]-led France in the quarter-finals in a classic of [[Total Football]]. The game played to a 1\u20131 draw in regulation time, and after a goalless extra time, it all came down to a penalty shoot-out, where Brazil was defeated 4\u20133. After 40 years, Brazil was victorious in the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], this being their fourth victory in four tournaments hosted in Brazil. This achievement ended a 19-year streak without official titles for the Brazilians. The last one had been in the 1970 World Cup.\n\nAt the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] in Italy, Brazil was coached by [[Sebasti\u00e3o Lazaroni]], that had been the coach in the 1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica. With a [[Brazil at the 1990 FIFA World Cup#Starting 11|defensive scheme]], whose main symbol was midfielder [[Dunga]], forward [[Careca]] and three centre-backs, the team lacked creativity but made it to the second round. Brazil was eliminated by [[Diego Maradona]]-led Argentina in the round of 16 in [[Turin]], losing to their South American archrivals 1\u20130.<ref>[http://www.espnfc.com/feature/_/id/696774?cc=5739 \"World Cup 1990\"].ESPN.
