He was a philosopher, statesman and ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of [[Armenia]], and is still one of the driving forces of [[Armenian nationalism]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} People praised him as the \"prophet of the Armenians\".{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=266}} Nzhdeh founded a movement named ''[[Tseghakron]]'' (\"religion of the nation\"), which was among the core doctrines of the [[Armenian Youth Federation]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] upholding the ordered world,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} and praised [[Hayk]], the mythical patriarch of the [[Armenians]], and [[Vahagn]], the fire and warrior god \"[[Proto-Indo-European religion#Dragon or serpent|fighter of the serpent]]\", and believed Hetanism would awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}}\n\nThe first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the \"Order of the Children of Ari\" (or \"Ara\"; ''Arordineri Ukht'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard) Kakosyan (1936\u20132005).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]]; in 1979 he fled to the [[United States]] where he became familiar with the ideas of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] (1886\u20131955).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}}\n\nAccording to modern hetanists, Garegin Nzhdeh is [[Apotheosis|deified]] as an incarnation of Vahagn, the re-establisher of the true faith of the Armenians and of the Armenian values.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}}\n\n=== 1990s: Establishment of the Children of Ari ===\nThe hetanists re-emerged after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the soviet union]]. They began to hold rituals on traditional Armenian holidays. The [[Temple of Garni]] became the centre of the community, a council of priests was set up in order to manage the organisation and the rites.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106, note 7}} During the 1990s, the group reached visibility in wider Armenian society.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} According to the scholar Yulia Antonyan, the emergence of the Armenian Native Faith is attributable to the same causes which led to the rise of other modern religious movements, but also [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movements, in the other post-Soviet countries: The Armenian Native Faith represents the indigenous answer to the social and cultural upheavals which followed the collapse of Soviet society and of its atheist and materialist ideology.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=104}}\n\n=== Republican Party support and grassroots spread ===\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_13.jpg|thumb|An Arordiner priest]]\n[[Ashot Navasardyan]] (1950\u20131997) and [[Andranik Margaryan]] (1949\u20132007), founding fathers of the [[Republican Party of Armenia]], were hetanists like many other members of the party and took part in the very first ritual at the Temple of Garni.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=270}} The Armenian government provides financial support for the Children of Ari.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} Arordiner festivals are celebrated in some regions with the support of local municipalities.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107, note 8}} Despite this strong link with the nationalist political scene, hetanism itself does not have a political orientation, and the priests are forbidden from joining any political party.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}}\n\nAlthough it started among the Armenian intellectual elites as a means to reawaken Armenian identity, in most recent times the Armenian Native Faith movement has expanded its contingent of adherents among the provincial and rural populations,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} and among the [[Armenian diaspora]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} Besides the philosophical approach of the intellectuals, the common people are driven to the Armenian Native Faith by various reasons, ranging from [[mysticism]] to a sentimental devotion to the gods. Antonyan documented the case of a thirty-five years-old woman who believed to be [[Infertility|infertile]], and who joined the Armenian Native Faith movement after she allegedly became pregnant by praying to Anahit, goddess of fertility, and to Astghik, goddess of love and beauty.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} The woman gave her daughter the name \"Nana\", another name of the goddess of fertility.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}}\n\nLocal Arordiner communities have been organised in villages outside the capital [[Yerevan]]. The structure of the Order of the Children of Ari, and of the local communities themselves, is characterised by a clear hierarchy, with the council of priests, led by an elected chief, handling the organisation of all activities. The highest position within the hierarchy is that of the supreme priest, which has remained vacant since Slak Kakosyan's death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=267\u2013268}}\n\n== Cosmology and philosophy ==\n[[File:Aramazd.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of God Aramazd]]\n\n==== Chaos and Order ====\nThe theology of Hetanism is a [[monism]].

Thus, it is illogical to strive to create an eternal order - it is logically impossible, and ultimately will only create an illusion of order. Hetanists see the meaning of life and the way to escape the endless cycles of order and chaos in confronting the chaos personally and \"taming\" it, thus ensuring perfect harmony and stability in the universe and personal life of Hetanists.

That is to say, men are believed to come back to life in the following generations of their own descendants, in the kin which they begot while living.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} According to hetanist doctrines, the entire world goes through similar cycles, from the smaller ones represented by the days and the years, to the greatest ones represented by eras of ten thousand years.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nThe struggle between order and chaos unfolds through the cycle of each era: Order and connection with the ancestors prevail during the world's summer and spring; while chaos, confusion and forsaking of the ancestral roots prevail during the world's autumn and winter. In the latter period, beings are not in harmony with Ar, they are not nourished by cosmic energy. At the darkest stage of history, though, which according to Arordiners corresponds to the current times, Vahagn And Mihr(who is born again) bring the order back.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\n== Deities ==\nThe different deities are beneath the supreme Ar.

It is due to Anahit that the Armenian nation still exists and will continue to live.

A mountain in [[Sophene]] district was known as Anahit's throne (''Athor Anahta''). The entire district of Erez, in the province of Akilisene (Ekeghiats), was called ''Anahtakan Gavar''.\n\nAccording to [[Plutarch]], the temple of Erez was the wealthiest and the noblest in Armenia.   During the expedition of [[Mark Antony]] in Armenia, the statue was broken to pieces by the Roman soldiers. [[Pliny the Elder]] gives us the following story about it: The Emperor [[Augustus]], being invited to dinner by one of his generals, asked him if it were true that the wreckers of Anahit's statue had been punished by the wrathful goddess. \"No!\" answered the general, \"on the contrary, I have to\u2011day the good fortune of treating you with one part of the hip of that gold statue.\" The Armenians erected a new golden statue of Anahit in Erez, which was worshiped before the time of [[Gregory the Illuminator|St. Gregory Illuminator]].<ref name=\"Leeming\"/>\n\nThe annual festivity of the month [[Navasard]], held in honor of Anahit, was the occasion of great gatherings, attended with dance, music, recitals, competitions, etc. The sick went to the temples in pilgrimage, asking for recovery. The symbol of ancient Armenian medicine was the head of the bronze gilded statue of the goddess Anahit.\n\n=== Vahagn ===\nVahagn, somestimes known as Aray or Demetr, was the third God of the pantheon, who was described in ancient armenian poems as a bright and red-haired teen with fire-like hair and beard and eyes that shined like the sun. He is the dying and reborning God, who is born from the union of water and fire, soil and the sky.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|url=https://books.google.am/books?id=NyzDrkPG2nIC&pg=PA797|title=Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics: Algonquins-Art|date=October 2001|publisher=Adegi Graphics LLC|isbn=978-1-4021-9433-7|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHe is the most popular Armenian God and is a notable figure in the armenian consicene even nowadays.\n\nIt is said that Vahagn fought and conquered dragons, hence his title Vishabakagh, \"dragon reaper\", where dragons in Armenian lore are identified as \"[[Vishap]]s\". He was invoked as a god of courage, later identified with Heracles.\n\nThe Vahagnian song was sung to the accompaniment of the lyre by the bards of Goghten (modern Akulis), long after the conversion of Armenia to Christianity.\n\nThe stalk or reed, key to the situation, is an important word in Indo-European mythology, in connection with fire in its three forms. Vahagn was linked to [[Verethragna]], the hypostasis of victory in the texts of the [[Avesta]]; the name turned into Vahagn (the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] \"th\" becoming \"h\" in [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] [[Middle Persian]]), later on to take the form of Vahagn. See \u054e\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0563\u0576 for more on the origin of the name.\n\nThe name of the Armenian princely house of [[Vahevuni]]s is believed to derive from Vahagn. The Vahevunis were ranked high in the Royal Register of Armenia, recorded by King [[Valarshak]]. In pre-Christian Armenia, the Vahevunis hereditarily possessed the temple town of [[Ashtishat]] on the left bank of the [[Aratzani]] river and most likely also held the post of the [[Sparapet]], ''i.e.'', the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Armenian Army.<ref name=\"Leeming\"/>\n\nGaregin Njdeh, an armenian national hero, is considered a reincarnation of Vahagn.\n\n====== Astghik ======\nAstghik was the lover of Vahagn and was considered his polar opposite. She was the goddess of love and water. According to folk tradition, Vahagn met Astghik in the field of Ararat. Their marriage was a blessing for the earth, and soon holy rain started pouring from the sky fertilizing the lands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/agathangelos/en/AGATHANGELOS.html|title=AGATHANGELOS, History of St. Gregory and the Conversion of Armenia|website=www.vehi.net|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nHer name is the diminutive of Armenian \u0561\u057d\u057f\u0572 ''''ast\u0142'''' , meaning ''\"[[star]]\"'', and all star goddesses were originally called Night goddesses including the morning and evening star (Venus) which from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *h\u2082st\u1e17r is [[cognate]] to Sanskrit ''st\u1e5b\u0301'', Avestan ''star'', Pahlavi ''star'', Persian ''set\u0101r'', [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: ast\u1e17r etc.\n\nHer principal seat was in [[Ashtishat]] (Taron), located to the North from [[Mu\u015f]], where her chamber was dedicated to the name of [[Vahagn]], the personification of a sun-god, her lover or husband according to popular tales, and had been named \"Vahagn's bedroom\".\n\nOther temples and places of worship of Ast\u0142ik had been located in various towns and villages, such as the mountain of [[Palaty]] (to the South-West from [[Lake Van]]), in [[Artamet]] (12&nbsp;km from Van), etc.\n\nThe unique monuments of prehistoric Armenia, [[vishap]] \"dragon stones\" (Arm. vi\u0161ap 'serpent, water dragon'), spread in many provinces of historical Armenia \u2013 Gegharkunik, Aragatsotn, Javakhk, Tayk, etc., and are additional manifestations of her worship.\n\n=== Nane ===\nGoddess of War, Nane was depicted as a young beautiful woman in the clothing of a warrior, with spear and shield in hand\n\nIt is however known that in Ancient Armenia, it was traditional for Kings to meet with the oldest woman in their dynasty because she was often seen as the epitome of Nane. In Armenia and other countries around the world, the name Nane continues to be used not only as a personal name, but also as a nickname for the grandmother of the household. ''Nanna, Nani, Nannan, etc''\n\nThe [[temple]] of the goddess Nane was in the town of Thil across from the Lycus River. Her temple was destroyed during the Christianization of Armenia.\n\n=== Mihr ===\nMihr is somtimes considered to be out of the pantheon, as he has a special status as a sun-God. Together with Vahagn, he brings the world from chaos into order. \n\nMihr is the root of many Armenian proper names such as Mihran, Mihrdat and Mehruzhan. The Armenian hetanist temple Mehian also has the same source. The month of February was dedicated to Mihr and it was called Mehekan. In 301 A.D. Christianity became the official religion of Armenia, and the Armenian church adopted many hetanist rites and ceremonies. For example, the Christian fire-festival of [[Trndez]], which has hetanist roots is still celebrated in February, the month dedicated to Mihr.\n\nAramazd, Vahagn and Anahit together constituted the holy trinity of the hetanist religion. Contrary to other religions of the world, Armenains didn't have a conception of hell or bad Gods. All bad in the world comes from humanity, and the underground is root of life.\n\nArmenians consider holy the water, lions, apricot tree and fire.\n\n=== Spandaramet ===\nSpandaramet was the manifestation of the underworld, which, unlike in western traditions, was considered root of life and not death.\n\nSpandaramet was the guardian spirit of the land and the vines, the latter meaning, the Christian writers of the fifth century Armenians used to translate this name Dionysius. By associating Spandaramet with the [[Abyss (religion)|Abyss]], this word was used as a synonym for Hades, an idea that already appeared in other mythologies of [[Zoroastrianism]].\n\n=== The ''Ukhtagirk'' ===\n''Ukhtagirk'', the holy book of the Armenian Native Faith, may be translated as \"Book of Vows\". It was the life work of Slak Kakosyan, who finished the manuscript just before his death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} Kakosyan, however, is not the \"author\" of the ''Ukhtagirk'', but rather the \"recorder\" of oral traditions,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} its \"compiler\" (''kazmogh'').{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} The book was officially proclaimed the holy text of the Order of the Children of Ari in 2000, a couple of years before its completion, when the religious organisation was officially registered by the Armenian state.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n\nThe book is divided into seven parts: \u2460 ''Astvatsashoonch'' (\"Dictionary\"), which explains the Armenian language as a mystical system of symbols related to the root ''Ar''; \u2461 ''Tsagumnaran'' (\"Genesis\"), which explains in mythical terms the origin of the world, the gods and mankind; \u2462 ''Avetaran'' (\"Book of Testaments\") and \u2463 ''Dzonaran'' (\"Book of Odes\"), which deal with philosophical and ontological categories to explain reality and values; \u2464 ''Veharan'' (\"Book of Greatness\") and \u2465 ''Patgamaran'' (\"Book of Commandments\"), which present mythologised descriptions of Garegin Nzhdeh's life and ideas, respectively; and the seventh and last chapter, \u2466 ''Hymnergaran'' (\"Book of Hymns\"), which is a collection of poems written by Kakosyan and his followers, as well as by authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The mythological parts about creation rely upon Armenian medieval sources and folk knowledge.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271\u2013272}}\n\nChanting ritual texts from the book is considered to procure mystical experiences, and the physical book itself is crucial for some ritual activities, such as wedding ceremonies, in which the rings are passed to the bride and groom on top of a copy of the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} At the same time, Arordiners do not consider their book unquestionable, but the text is open to corrections as required by changing circumstances. This attitude is supported by a declaration of Slak Kakosyan himself, who conceived the book in the terms of a changeful and adaptable truth.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}}\n\n== Practices ==\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_30.jpg|thumb|300x300px|People gathered on the occasion of a public ceremony at the Temple of Garni]]\nArmenian Native Faith practices, rituals and representations mostly rely on the instructions given by the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} For instance, it is common for the priests to make pilgrimage to [[Khustup|Mount Khustup]], where, according to the book, Garegin Nzhdeh experienced the presence of the god Vahagn.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The priests' aim is to replicate such experience.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The veneration of Nzhdeh and the pilgrimage to his burial site, which is located on the slopes of the Khustup, is also slowly developing within the larger community of Hetanists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110, note 14}} In general, mountains are revered as holy, so, besides Khustup, other mountains, including [[Mount Ararat]] and [[Mount Aragats]], function as pilgrimage destination for hetanists.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275, 278}}\n\n=== Rituals ===\nArmenian Native Faith rituals include the yearly ceremonies performed on Armenian traditional holidays, and three [[rites of passage]]: The ''knunk'', a complex ritual of initiation; the ''psak'', that is wedding; and death rituals.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} The death rituals require the [[cremation]] of the body,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} and its return to the four elements. Fire is symbolised by the cremation itself; then the ashes are divided into three parts, of which one is buried in the earth, one is scattered in the air of the [[Garni Gorge]], and the third one is poured in the water of the Garni River.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}} Afterwards, the deceased is memorialised by the collective lighting of a torch.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=278}} The first Arordiner to be cremated was Kakosyan himself,when cremation is illegal in Armenia. Later, hetanists obtained by the state the right to cremate their dead.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}}[[File:Hetan_initiation_ritual_(0).PNG|thumb|Stage of a ''knunk'' ritual|alt=|left]]The Armenian term ''knunk'' may be translated as \"conversion\" or \"reversion\" (to the native way of life).{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}} Yulia Antonyan observed that about ten to twenty people take part to each ''knunk'' ritual, which is held on the occasion of the public ceremonies at the Temple of Garni. At the same time, there are many hetanists who believe that in order to worship the native gods of Armenia it is not necessary to undergo an official conversion.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}}\n\n=== Temples and idols ===\nArordiner public ceremonies and rituals are held at ancient sacred places, which are often in ruins.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The re-appropriation of churches that were built on native sacred sites is also common.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The most important of these sites is the first-century Temple of Garni, a temple which was rebuilt in 1975, which has become the main ceremonial center for the Armenian Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\nThe Arordiners have reconsecrated the temple to Vahagn, although historically it was dedicated to Mihr. They have also been given approval for the rearrangement of the compound, in order for it to match the ideal structure of ancient Armenian sanctuaries.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} They have added a holy spring dedicated to Slak Kakosyan and a wood of [[apricot]] trees, the holy tree of Armenian Native Faith. The temple is now organised into three sacred spaces: The first is the sacred spring, the second one is the temple proper, and the third one is the holy wood, located on a hillock.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=119|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2pp=275\u2013277}} The rituals at the Temple of Garni take place following a route which starts from the spring, passes through the temple, and endly reaches the holy wood.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} Downhill, each newly established local Arordiner community plants a tree, symbolising the unity and well-being of the group itself. These holy trees are adorned with ribbons and handkerchiefs symbolising one's requests to the gods.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275\u2013277}}\n\nBesides the Temple of Garni, other sites considered holy by the Arordiners and used for their rituals include the [[Metsamor Castle]] (third millennium BCE), considered a site for the cult of the mother goddess, the [[Erebuni Fortress]] (eighth century BCE), [[Shengavit Settlement|Shengavit]] (fourth to second millennium BCE) and [[Zorats Karer]] (third millennium BCE), and the mountains.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275\u2013277}} Sculptures representing the gods which have been realised within the context of modern Armenian Native Faith are inspired by both historical specimens and the creativity of modern artists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\n=== Holidays ===\nThe Arordiners celebrate a number of holidays:{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} Terendez, Zatik, Hambardzum, [[Vardavar]] and Khaghoghorhnek. To these holy days they add a holy day for the remembrance of ancestors (20 September), the Birth of Vahagn (21 March), the Birth of Mihr (22 December) and the Navasard, the New Year celebrated in August.\n\n== Poetry and legends ==\nSeveral hetanist legends and poems have survived till our days.

After the arrogant [[Titan (mythology)|Titanid]] [[Belus (Babylonian)|Bel]] made himself king over all, Hayk emigrated to the region near [[Mount Ararat]]. Hayk relocated near Mount Ararat with an extended household of at least 300 and settled there, founding a village he named ''Haykashen''. On the way he had left a detachment in another settlement with his grandson Kadmos. Bel sent one of his sons to entreat him to return, but was refused. Bel decided to march against him with a massive force, but Hayk was warned ahead of time by Kadmos of his pending approach. He assembled his own army along the shore of [[Lake Van]] and told them that they must defeat and kill Bel, or die trying to do so, rather than become his slaves. In his writings Moses states that:<blockquote>\u201c Hayk was a handsome, friendly man, with curly hair, sparkling eyes, and strong arms. He was a man of giant stature, a mighty archer and fearless warrior. Hayk and his people, from the time of their forefathers [[Noah]] and [[Japheth]], had migrated south toward the warmer lands near Babylon. In that land there ruled a wicked giant, Bel. Bel tried to impose his tyranny upon Hayk's people. But proud Hayk refused to submit to Bel. As soon as his son Aramaniak was born, Hayk rose up and led his people northward into the land of [[Ayrarat|Ararad]]. At the foot of the mountain he built a village and gave it his name, calling Haykashen. \u201d</blockquote>Hayk and his men soon discovered Bel's army positioned in a mountain pass (Moses of Chorene located the site as [[Dastakert]]), with the king in the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]].\n\nAt ''Dyutsaznamart'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0534\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0581\u0561\u0566\u0576\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0580\u057f, \"Battle of Giants\"), near [[Julamerk]] southeast of [[Lake Van]], on 11 August 2492 BC (according to the Armenian traditional chronology of the first month of the [[Armenian calendar]], Navasard or 2107 BC (according to \"The Chronological table\" of [[Mikael Chamchian]]), Hayk slew Bel with a nearly impossible shot using a long bow, sending the king's forces into disarray.\n\nThe hill where Bel with his warriors fell, Hayk named ''Gerezmank'' meaning \"tombs\". He embalmed the corpse of Bel and ordered it to be taken to Hark where it was to be buried in a high place in the view of the wives and sons of the king.\n\nSoon after, Hayk established the fortress of [[Haykaberd]] at the battle site and the town of Haykashen in the Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] (modern-day Turkey). He named the region of the battle ''Hayk'', and the site of the battle Hayots Dzor.\n\n=== Ara the handsome ===\nAnother ancient Armenian legend is connected with Ara the beautiful, God of spring and rebirth.\n\nAccording to the legend, Shamiram had fallen in love with the handsome Ara and asked him to marry her. When Ara refused, Semiramis, in the heat of passion, gathered the armies of [[Assyria]] and marched against Armenia. During the battle Semiramis was victorious, but Ara was slain despite her orders to capture him alive. To avoid continuous warfare with the Armenians, Shamiram, reputed to be a sorceress, took his body and prayed to the gods to raise Ara from the dead. When the Armenians advanced to avenge their leader, Shamiram disguised one of her lovers as Ara and spread the rumor that the gods had brought Ara back to life, convincing the Armenians not to continue the war. Nevertheless, Ara is reborn later and gets his revenge on the Assyrian queen.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt was also reported that a village called Lezk, near [[Van, Turkey|Van]], traditionally held that it was Ara's place of resurrection.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== Torq Angegh ===\nTorq was considered one of [[Hayk]]'s great-grandsons and reportedly represented as an unattractive male figure. He is mentioned by Armenian 5th Century historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] and considered one of the significant deities of the Armenian pantheon. Taken in the context of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] religions, it is conceivable that an etymological connection with [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Thor]]/Tyr is more than a simple coincidence. According to tradition, with his immense strength he threw rocks at the invading Greek navy, keeping the shores of Armenia safe.\n\n== Relations with Christianity ==\n[[File:\u054a\u0561\u0580_\u0533\u0561\u057c\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574.jpg|thumb|A ritual dance at the Temple of Garni]]\nThe relations between the Armenian Native Faith movement and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] have been good and collaborative, since both share the common interest of protecting and promoting Armenian identity, especially against what are perceived as disruptive foreign forces infiltrating the country, such as Protestants, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mormonism|Mormons]].{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} The Armenian Apostolic Church generally sees Arordiners as allies. A high-ranking spokesman of the Armenian Apostolic Church declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian Church has an unequivocal stance on sectarians (i.e. Protestants et al.), but we do not interfere into hetanos affairs.}}\nSimilarly, the head of an Armenian institution catering to the victims of destructive cults declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian nation must remember its pre-Christian past, and Ara's Children help them remember. They also support the Armenian Apostolic Church in its fight against destructive sects.}}\nArmenian Native Faith believers' attitude towards Christianity oscillates between two positions: The critique of the religion's role in Armenian history, and the conditional acceptance of the Armenian Apostolic Church as a national institution.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} Christianity is criticised for having destroyed the rich and highly developed ancient Armenian culture, replacing the values of courage, martial spirit and honour with those of humility, obedience and modesty, thus causing the collapse of Armenian statehood and condemning the nation to centuries of subordination to foreign powers, migrations, persecutions and massacres.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} According to the strongest accusations, Christianity is responsible for the \"first genocide of the Armenians\", which coincided with its forceful introduction in the fourth century.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nAt the same time, the Armenian Apostolic Church is considered an institution peculiar to the Armenian nation, and the fruit of a synthesis of Christian and indigenous elements, in which the former represent just the surface. The hetanists find proof of this in the Church's prayers devoted to the Sun and light, in Church festivals overlapping indigenous Armenian festivals, and in the practice of ''matagh'', Christian animal sacrifice. Moreover, the hetanists believe that the Armenian alphabet, which Church historiography holds to have been invented by the monk Mesrop Mahtots, is actually an elaboration of ancient Armenian symbolism based on the motif of the ''[[swastika]]''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nHetanists generally do not have problems visiting Armenian churches and treating them as holy places, since many of them were built on the site of pre-Christian temples. Furthermore, some figures of the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church are revered as Hetanists in disguise: The ''[[Catholicos|catholicoi]]'' (high-ranking bishops) Vazgen I (in charge 1954\u20131994) and Garegin I (1995\u20131999). The former was a supporter of Nzhdeh and on his tombstone, instead of a cross, he has a letter of the Armenian alphabet which is considered a variant of the ''swastika'' and symbolic of seven Armenian gods. The latter is said to have visited Garni before his death and, despite being terminally ill, to have walked alone to the temple.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n<references group=\"\" responsive=\"0\"></references>\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n* {{cite contribution|last1=Siekierski|first1=Konrad|last2=Antonyan|first2=Yulia|year=2013|contribution=A Neopagan Movement in Armenia: the Children of Ara|title=Modern Pagan and Native Faith Movements in Central and Eastern Europe|editor1=Kaarina Aitamurto|editor2=Scott Simpson|isbn=9781844656622|location=Durham|publisher=Acumen|pages=266\u2013282|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2010|title='Re-creation' of a Religion: Neo-paganism in Armenia|url=https://www.academia.edu/191429|journal=Laboratorium|language=ru|location=Saint-Petersburg|pages=103\u2013128|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|language=hy|archivedate=16 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416201021/http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=|ref=harv|pages=23\u201330|isbn=9789993079934|first=Yulia|location=Yerevan|publisher=Lingva|url=http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|title=Identities and Changing World, Proceedings of International Conference|contribution=The Aryan Myth and the New Armenian Paganism|year=2008|author-mask={{long dash}}|url-status=dead}}\n\n; Armenian neoshamanism\n\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2008|contribution=Magical and Healing Practices in Contemporary Urban Environment (in Armenian Cities of Yerevan, Gyumri, and Vanadzor|title=Figuring the South Caucasus: Societies and Environment|publisher=Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation|location=Tbilisi|isbn=9789941900914|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2006|title=On the Name and Origins of 'Chopchi' Healing Practices|journal=Bulletin of Armenian Studies|pages=61\u201366|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2003|title=Pre-Christian Healers in a Christian Society|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|volume=27|ref=harv|number=2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://arordiukht.do.am/ Order of the Children of Ari] \u2014 official website\n* [http://www.hayary.org/ Armenian Aryan Congregation] \u2014 official website\n\n[[Category:Hetanism]]\n[[Category:Religion in ancient history]]\n[[Category:Religion in Armenia]]\n", "text_old": "<noinclude>{{User:RMCD bot/subject notice|1=Hetanism|2=Talk:Armenian Native Faith#Requested move 10 April 2020 }}</noinclude>\n{{short description|Armenian Pre-Christian faith}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Sidebar with collapsible lists\n|name = Hetanism sidebar\n|bodyclass = plainlist\n|pretitle = Part of [[:Category:Hetanism|a series]] on\n|title = [[Hetanism]]\n|image = [[File:Left-Facing Armenian Eternity Sign UC 058E SVG.svg|150px|Arevakhach, symbol of Hetanism]]\n|caption = ''[[Arevakhach]]'', primary symbol of Hetanism\n|listtitlestyle = color:#ffffff; background-color:#800\n|contentclass = hlist \n\n|list1name = Primary\n|list1title = Main Conceptions\n|content1 =\n|list1 = {{startflatlist}}\n*[[Ar (hetanism)|Ar]]\n*[[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos vs. Order]]\n*[[Fire worship]]\n*[[List of water deities|Water worship]]\n*[[Monotheism]] with [[Polytheism|Polytheistic]] characteristics\n*[[Tseghakron]]\n*[[Armenian mythology]]\n*[[Monarchism]]\n{{endflatlist}}\n\n|list2name = Divine\n|list2title = Divine entities\n|list2 = {{startflatlist}}\n* [[Aramazd]]\n* [[Hayk]]\n* [[Anahit]]\n* [[Vahagn]]\n* [[Tir]]\n* [[Mihr]]\n* [[Vanatur]]\n* [[Ara the Beautiful]]\n* [[Turk\u2018 Ange\u0142|Turk-angel]]\n* [[Nane]]\n* [[Astghik]]\n* [[Spandaramet]]\n* [[Barshamin]]\n{{endflatlist}}\n\n|list3name = Scripture and worship\n|list3title = Scripture and worship\n|list3 = {{startflatlist}}\n*[[Ukhtagirq]]\n*[[Vardavar]]\n*[[Matagh]]\n*[[Knunk]]\n*[[Garni Temple]]\n{{endflatlist}}\n\n|list4name = Accounts and legends\n|list4title = Accounts and legends\n|list4 = {{startflatlist}}\n*[[Ughtagirk]]\n*[[Movses Khorenatsi]]\n*[[Anania Shirakatsi]]\n*[[Ara the Beautiful]]\n*[[Hayk and Bel]]\n*[[Birth of Vahagn]]\n*[[Creation myth]]\n{{endflatlist}}\n\n|list5name = History and culture\n|list5title = History and culture\n|list5 = {{startflatlist}}\n*[[Haldi]]sm\n*[[Matagh]]\n*[[Armenian calendar]]\n{{endflatlist}}\n\n|list7name = Related topics\n|list7title = Related topics\n|list7 = {{startflatlist}}\n*[[Zoroastrianism in Armenia]]\n*[[Kingdom of Armenia]]\n*[[Tseghakronism]]\n{{endflatlist}}\n\n|below = {{portal-inline|Religion}}\n\n}}\n'''Hetanism''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0540\u0565\u0569\u0561\u0576\u0578\u057d\u0578\u0582\u0569\u056b\u0582\u0576 ''Hetanosutiwn'') or '''Armenian native faith''', was the dominant<ref name=\"Romeny 2010\">{{Cite book|last=Romeny|first=R.

He was a philosopher, statesman and ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of [[Armenia]], and is still one of the driving forces of [[Armenian nationalism]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} People praised him as the \"prophet of the Armenians\".{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=266}} Nzhdeh founded a movement named ''[[Tseghakron]]'' (\"religion of the nation\"), which was among the core doctrines of the [[Armenian Youth Federation]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] upholding the ordered world,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} and praised [[Hayk]], the mythical patriarch of the [[Armenians]], and [[Vahagn]], the fire and warrior god \"[[Proto-Indo-European religion#Dragon or serpent|fighter of the serpent]]\", and believed Hetanism would awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}}\n\nThe first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the \"Order of the Children of Ari\" (or \"Ara\"; ''Arordineri Ukht'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard) Kakosyan (1936\u20132005).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]]; in 1979 he fled to the [[United States]] where he became familiar with the ideas of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] (1886\u20131955).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}}\n\nAccording to modern hetanists, Garegin Nzhdeh is [[Apotheosis|deified]] as an incarnation of Vahagn, the re-establisher of the true faith of the Armenians and of the Armenian values.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}}\n\n=== 1990s: Establishment of the Children of Ari ===\nThe hetanists re-emerged after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the soviet union]]. They began to hold rituals on traditional Armenian holidays. The [[Temple of Garni]] became the centre of the community, a council of priests was set up in order to manage the organisation and the rites.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106, note 7}} During the 1990s, the group reached visibility in wider Armenian society.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} According to the scholar Yulia Antonyan, the emergence of the Armenian Native Faith is attributable to the same causes which led to the rise of other modern religious movements, but also [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movements, in the other post-Soviet countries: The Armenian Native Faith represents the indigenous answer to the social and cultural upheavals which followed the collapse of Soviet society and of its atheist and materialist ideology.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=104}}\n\n=== Republican Party support and grassroots spread ===\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_13.jpg|thumb|An Arordiner priest]]\n[[Ashot Navasardyan]] (1950\u20131997) and [[Andranik Margaryan]] (1949\u20132007), founding fathers of the [[Republican Party of Armenia]], were hetanists like many other members of the party and took part in the very first ritual at the Temple of Garni.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=270}} The Armenian government provides financial support for the Children of Ari.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} Arordiner festivals are celebrated in some regions with the support of local municipalities.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107, note 8}} Despite this strong link with the nationalist political scene, hetanism itself does not have a political orientation, and the priests are forbidden from joining any political party.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}}\n\nAlthough it started among the Armenian intellectual elites as a means to reawaken Armenian identity, in most recent times the Armenian Native Faith movement has expanded its contingent of adherents among the provincial and rural populations,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} and among the [[Armenian diaspora]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} Besides the philosophical approach of the intellectuals, the common people are driven to the Armenian Native Faith by various reasons, ranging from [[mysticism]] to a sentimental devotion to the gods. Antonyan documented the case of a thirty-five years-old woman who believed to be [[Infertility|infertile]], and who joined the Armenian Native Faith movement after she allegedly became pregnant by praying to Anahit, goddess of fertility, and to Astghik, goddess of love and beauty.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} The woman gave her daughter the name \"Nana\", another name of the goddess of fertility.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}}\n\nLocal Arordiner communities have been organised in villages outside the capital [[Yerevan]]. The structure of the Order of the Children of Ari, and of the local communities themselves, is characterised by a clear hierarchy, with the council of priests, led by an elected chief, handling the organisation of all activities. The highest position within the hierarchy is that of the supreme priest, which has remained vacant since Slak Kakosyan's death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=267\u2013268}}\n\n== Cosmology and philosophy ==\n[[File:Aramazd.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of God Aramazd]]\n\n==== Chaos and Order ====\nThe theology of Hetanism is a [[monism]].

Thus, it is illogical to strive to create an eternal order - it is logically impossible, and ultimately will only create an illusion of order. Hetanists see the meaning of life and the way to escape the endless cycles of order and chaos in confronting the chaos personally and \"taming\" it, thus ensuring perfect harmony and stability in the universe and personal life of Hetanists.

That is to say, men are believed to come back to life in the following generations of their own descendants, in the kin which they begot while living.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} According to hetanist doctrines, the entire world goes through similar cycles, from the smaller ones represented by the days and the years, to the greatest ones represented by eras of ten thousand years.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nThe struggle between order and chaos unfolds through the cycle of each era: Order and connection with the ancestors prevail during the world's summer and spring; while chaos, confusion and forsaking of the ancestral roots prevail during the world's autumn and winter. In the latter period, beings are not in harmony with Ar, they are not nourished by cosmic energy. At the darkest stage of history, though, which according to Arordiners corresponds to the current times, Vahagn And Mihr(who is born again) bring the order back.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\n== Deities ==\nThe different deities are beneath the supreme Ar.

He was called almighty and all-father. His temple was in Kamakh, Ani province, which also was a grave for Armenian kings of the [[Artaxiad|artaxiad dynasty of Armenia.]] Along with his son and daughter Anahit and Vahagn, he constituted the holy triad of Hetanism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|url=https://books.google.am/books?id=NyzDrkPG2nIC&pg=PA797&dq=Anahit&hl=en&ei=eEwFTZncGs-dOt6zyaYB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Anahit&f=false|title=Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics: Algonquins-Art|date=October 2001|publisher=Adegi Graphics LLC|isbn=978-1-4021-9433-7|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Anahit ===\nDaughter of Aramazd.

It is due to Anahit that the Armenian nation still exists and will continue to live.

A mountain in [[Sophene]] district was known as Anahit's throne (''Athor Anahta''). The entire district of Erez, in the province of Akilisene (Ekeghiats), was called ''Anahtakan Gavar''.\n\nAccording to [[Plutarch]], the temple of Erez was the wealthiest and the noblest in Armenia.   During the expedition of [[Mark Antony]] in Armenia, the statue was broken to pieces by the Roman soldiers. [[Pliny the Elder]] gives us the following story about it: The Emperor [[Augustus]], being invited to dinner by one of his generals, asked him if it were true that the wreckers of Anahit's statue had been punished by the wrathful goddess. \"No!\" answered the general, \"on the contrary, I have to\u2011day the good fortune of treating you with one part of the hip of that gold statue.\" The Armenians erected a new golden statue of Anahit in Erez, which was worshiped before the time of [[Gregory the Illuminator|St. Gregory Illuminator]].<ref name=\"Leeming\"/>\n\nThe annual festivity of the month [[Navasard]], held in honor of Anahit, was the occasion of great gatherings, attended with dance, music, recitals, competitions, etc. The sick went to the temples in pilgrimage, asking for recovery. The symbol of ancient Armenian medicine was the head of the bronze gilded statue of the goddess Anahit.\n\n=== Vahagn ===\nVahagn, somestimes known as Aray or Demetr, was the third God of the pantheon, who was described in ancient armenian poems as a bright and red-haired teen with fire-like hair and beard and eyes that shined like the sun. He is the dying and reborning God, who is born from the union of water and fire, soil and the sky.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|url=https://books.google.am/books?id=NyzDrkPG2nIC&pg=PA797|title=Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics: Algonquins-Art|date=October 2001|publisher=Adegi Graphics LLC|isbn=978-1-4021-9433-7|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHe is the most popular Armenian God and is a notable figure in the armenian consicene even nowadays.\n\nIt is said that Vahagn fought and conquered dragons, hence his title Vishabakagh, \"dragon reaper\", where dragons in Armenian lore are identified as \"[[Vishap]]s\". He was invoked as a god of courage, later identified with Heracles.\n\nThe Vahagnian song was sung to the accompaniment of the lyre by the bards of Goghten (modern Akulis), long after the conversion of Armenia to Christianity.\n\nThe stalk or reed, key to the situation, is an important word in Indo-European mythology, in connection with fire in its three forms. Vahagn was linked to [[Verethragna]], the hypostasis of victory in the texts of the [[Avesta]]; the name turned into Vahagn (the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] \"th\" becoming \"h\" in [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] [[Middle Persian]]), later on to take the form of Vahagn. See \u054e\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0563\u0576 for more on the origin of the name.\n\nThe name of the Armenian princely house of [[Vahevuni]]s is believed to derive from Vahagn. The Vahevunis were ranked high in the Royal Register of Armenia, recorded by King [[Valarshak]]. In pre-Christian Armenia, the Vahevunis hereditarily possessed the temple town of [[Ashtishat]] on the left bank of the [[Aratzani]] river and most likely also held the post of the [[Sparapet]], ''i.e.'', the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Armenian Army.<ref name=\"Leeming\"/>\n\nGaregin Njdeh, an armenian national hero, is considered a reincarnation of Vahagn.\n\n====== Astghik ======\nAstghik was the lover of Vahagn and was considered his polar opposite. She was the goddess of love and water. According to folk tradition, Vahagn met Astghik in the field of Ararat. Their marriage was a blessing for the earth, and soon holy rain started pouring from the sky fertilizing the lands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/agathangelos/en/AGATHANGELOS.html|title=AGATHANGELOS, History of St. Gregory and the Conversion of Armenia|website=www.vehi.net|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nHer name is the diminutive of Armenian \u0561\u057d\u057f\u0572 ''''ast\u0142'''' , meaning ''\"[[star]]\"'', and all star goddesses were originally called Night goddesses including the morning and evening star (Venus) which from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *h\u2082st\u1e17r is [[cognate]] to Sanskrit ''st\u1e5b\u0301'', Avestan ''star'', Pahlavi ''star'', Persian ''set\u0101r'', [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: ast\u1e17r etc.\n\nHer principal seat was in [[Ashtishat]] (Taron), located to the North from [[Mu\u015f]], where her chamber was dedicated to the name of [[Vahagn]], the personification of a sun-god, her lover or husband according to popular tales, and had been named \"Vahagn's bedroom\".\n\nOther temples and places of worship of Ast\u0142ik had been located in various towns and villages, such as the mountain of [[Palaty]] (to the South-West from [[Lake Van]]), in [[Artamet]] (12&nbsp;km from Van), etc.\n\nThe unique monuments of prehistoric Armenia, [[vishap]] \"dragon stones\" (Arm. vi\u0161ap 'serpent, water dragon'), spread in many provinces of historical Armenia \u2013 Gegharkunik, Aragatsotn, Javakhk, Tayk, etc., and are additional manifestations of her worship.\n\n=== Nane ===\nGoddess of War, Nane was depicted as a young beautiful woman in the clothing of a warrior, with spear and shield in hand\n\nIt is however known that in Ancient Armenia, it was traditional for Kings to meet with the oldest woman in their dynasty because she was often seen as the epitome of Nane. In Armenia and other countries around the world, the name Nane continues to be used not only as a personal name, but also as a nickname for the grandmother of the household. ''Nanna, Nani, Nannan, etc''\n\nThe [[temple]] of the goddess Nane was in the town of Thil across from the Lycus River. Her temple was destroyed during the Christianization of Armenia.\n\n=== Mihr ===\nMihr is somtimes considered to be out of the pantheon, as he has a special status as a sun-God. Together with Vahagn, he brings the world from chaos into order. \n\nMihr is the root of many Armenian proper names such as Mihran, Mihrdat and Mehruzhan. The Armenian hetanist temple Mehian also has the same source. The month of February was dedicated to Mihr and it was called Mehekan. In 301 A.D. Christianity became the official religion of Armenia, and the Armenian church adopted many hetanist rites and ceremonies. For example, the Christian fire-festival of [[Trndez]], which has hetanist roots is still celebrated in February, the month dedicated to Mihr.\n\nAramazd, Vahagn and Anahit together constituted the holy trinity of the hetanist religion. Contrary to other religions of the world, Armenains didn't have a conception of hell or bad Gods. All bad in the world comes from humanity, and the underground is root of life.\n\nArmenians consider holy the water, lions, apricot tree and fire.\n\n=== Spandaramet ===\nSpandaramet was the manifestation of the underworld, which, unlike in western traditions, was considered root of life and not death.\n\nSpandaramet was the guardian spirit of the land and the vines, the latter meaning, the Christian writers of the fifth century Armenians used to translate this name Dionysius. By associating Spandaramet with the [[Abyss (religion)|Abyss]], this word was used as a synonym for Hades, an idea that already appeared in other mythologies of [[Zoroastrianism]].\n\n=== The ''Ukhtagirk'' ===\n''Ukhtagirk'', the holy book of the Armenian Native Faith, may be translated as \"Book of Vows\". It was the life work of Slak Kakosyan, who finished the manuscript just before his death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} Kakosyan, however, is not the \"author\" of the ''Ukhtagirk'', but rather the \"recorder\" of oral traditions,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} its \"compiler\" (''kazmogh'').{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} The book was officially proclaimed the holy text of the Order of the Children of Ari in 2000, a couple of years before its completion, when the religious organisation was officially registered by the Armenian state.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n\nThe book is divided into seven parts: \u2460 ''Astvatsashoonch'' (\"Dictionary\"), which explains the Armenian language as a mystical system of symbols related to the root ''Ar''; \u2461 ''Tsagumnaran'' (\"Genesis\"), which explains in mythical terms the origin of the world, the gods and mankind; \u2462 ''Avetaran'' (\"Book of Testaments\") and \u2463 ''Dzonaran'' (\"Book of Odes\"), which deal with philosophical and ontological categories to explain reality and values; \u2464 ''Veharan'' (\"Book of Greatness\") and \u2465 ''Patgamaran'' (\"Book of Commandments\"), which present mythologised descriptions of Garegin Nzhdeh's life and ideas, respectively; and the seventh and last chapter, \u2466 ''Hymnergaran'' (\"Book of Hymns\"), which is a collection of poems written by Kakosyan and his followers, as well as by authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The mythological parts about creation rely upon Armenian medieval sources and folk knowledge.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271\u2013272}}\n\nChanting ritual texts from the book is considered to procure mystical experiences, and the physical book itself is crucial for some ritual activities, such as wedding ceremonies, in which the rings are passed to the bride and groom on top of a copy of the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} At the same time, Arordiners do not consider their book unquestionable, but the text is open to corrections as required by changing circumstances. This attitude is supported by a declaration of Slak Kakosyan himself, who conceived the book in the terms of a changeful and adaptable truth.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}}\n\n== Practices ==\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_30.jpg|thumb|300x300px|People gathered on the occasion of a public ceremony at the Temple of Garni]]\nArmenian Native Faith practices, rituals and representations mostly rely on the instructions given by the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} For instance, it is common for the priests to make pilgrimage to [[Khustup|Mount Khustup]], where, according to the book, Garegin Nzhdeh experienced the presence of the god Vahagn.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The priests' aim is to replicate such experience.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The veneration of Nzhdeh and the pilgrimage to his burial site, which is located on the slopes of the Khustup, is also slowly developing within the larger community of Hetanists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110, note 14}} In general, mountains are revered as holy, so, besides Khustup, other mountains, including [[Mount Ararat]] and [[Mount Aragats]], function as pilgrimage destination for hetanists.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275, 278}}\n\n=== Rituals ===\nArmenian Native Faith rituals include the yearly ceremonies performed on Armenian traditional holidays, and three [[rites of passage]]: The ''knunk'', a complex ritual of initiation; the ''psak'', that is wedding; and death rituals.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} The death rituals require the [[cremation]] of the body,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} and its return to the four elements. Fire is symbolised by the cremation itself; then the ashes are divided into three parts, of which one is buried in the earth, one is scattered in the air of the [[Garni Gorge]], and the third one is poured in the water of the Garni River.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}} Afterwards, the deceased is memorialised by the collective lighting of a torch.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=278}} The first Arordiner to be cremated was Kakosyan himself,when cremation is illegal in Armenia. Later, hetanists obtained by the state the right to cremate their dead.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}}[[File:Hetan_initiation_ritual_(0).PNG|thumb|Stage of a ''knunk'' ritual|alt=|left]]The Armenian term ''knunk'' may be translated as \"conversion\" or \"reversion\" (to the native way of life).{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}} Yulia Antonyan observed that about ten to twenty people take part to each ''knunk'' ritual, which is held on the occasion of the public ceremonies at the Temple of Garni. At the same time, there are many hetanists who believe that in order to worship the native gods of Armenia it is not necessary to undergo an official conversion.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}}\n\n=== Temples and idols ===\nArordiner public ceremonies and rituals are held at ancient sacred places, which are often in ruins.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The re-appropriation of churches that were built on native sacred sites is also common.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The most important of these sites is the first-century Temple of Garni, a temple which was rebuilt in 1975, which has become the main ceremonial center for the Armenian Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\nThe Arordiners have reconsecrated the temple to Vahagn, although historically it was dedicated to Mihr. They have also been given approval for the rearrangement of the compound, in order for it to match the ideal structure of ancient Armenian sanctuaries.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} They have added a holy spring dedicated to Slak Kakosyan and a wood of [[apricot]] trees, the holy tree of Armenian Native Faith. The temple is now organised into three sacred spaces: The first is the sacred spring, the second one is the temple proper, and the third one is the holy wood, located on a hillock.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=119|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2pp=275\u2013277}} The rituals at the Temple of Garni take place following a route which starts from the spring, passes through the temple, and endly reaches the holy wood.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} Downhill, each newly established local Arordiner community plants a tree, symbolising the unity and well-being of the group itself. These holy trees are adorned with ribbons and handkerchiefs symbolising one's requests to the gods.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275\u2013277}}\n\nBesides the Temple of Garni, other sites considered holy by the Arordiners and used for their rituals include the [[Metsamor Castle]] (third millennium BCE), considered a site for the cult of the mother goddess, the [[Erebuni Fortress]] (eighth century BCE), [[Shengavit Settlement|Shengavit]] (fourth to second millennium BCE) and [[Zorats Karer]] (third millennium BCE), and the mountains.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275\u2013277}} Sculptures representing the gods which have been realised within the context of modern Armenian Native Faith are inspired by both historical specimens and the creativity of modern artists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\n=== Holidays ===\nThe Arordiners celebrate a number of holidays:{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} Terendez, Zatik, Hambardzum, [[Vardavar]] and Khaghoghorhnek. To these holy days they add a holy day for the remembrance of ancestors (20 September), the Birth of Vahagn (21 March), the Birth of Mihr (22 December) and the Navasard, the New Year celebrated in August.\n\n== Poetry and legends ==\nSeveral hetanist legends and poems have survived till our days.

After the arrogant [[Titan (mythology)|Titanid]] [[Belus (Babylonian)|Bel]] made himself king over all, Hayk emigrated to the region near [[Mount Ararat]]. Hayk relocated near Mount Ararat with an extended household of at least 300 and settled there, founding a village he named ''Haykashen''. On the way he had left a detachment in another settlement with his grandson Kadmos. Bel sent one of his sons to entreat him to return, but was refused. Bel decided to march against him with a massive force, but Hayk was warned ahead of time by Kadmos of his pending approach. He assembled his own army along the shore of [[Lake Van]] and told them that they must defeat and kill Bel, or die trying to do so, rather than become his slaves. In his writings Moses states that:<blockquote>\u201c Hayk was a handsome, friendly man, with curly hair, sparkling eyes, and strong arms. He was a man of giant stature, a mighty archer and fearless warrior. Hayk and his people, from the time of their forefathers [[Noah]] and [[Japheth]], had migrated south toward the warmer lands near Babylon. In that land there ruled a wicked giant, Bel. Bel tried to impose his tyranny upon Hayk's people. But proud Hayk refused to submit to Bel. As soon as his son Aramaniak was born, Hayk rose up and led his people northward into the land of [[Ayrarat|Ararad]]. At the foot of the mountain he built a village and gave it his name, calling Haykashen. \u201d</blockquote>Hayk and his men soon discovered Bel's army positioned in a mountain pass (Moses of Chorene located the site as [[Dastakert]]), with the king in the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]].\n\nAt ''Dyutsaznamart'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0534\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0581\u0561\u0566\u0576\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0580\u057f, \"Battle of Giants\"), near [[Julamerk]] southeast of [[Lake Van]], on 11 August 2492 BC (according to the Armenian traditional chronology of the first month of the [[Armenian calendar]], Navasard or 2107 BC (according to \"The Chronological table\" of [[Mikael Chamchian]]), Hayk slew Bel with a nearly impossible shot using a long bow, sending the king's forces into disarray.\n\nThe hill where Bel with his warriors fell, Hayk named ''Gerezmank'' meaning \"tombs\". He embalmed the corpse of Bel and ordered it to be taken to Hark where it was to be buried in a high place in the view of the wives and sons of the king.\n\nSoon after, Hayk established the fortress of [[Haykaberd]] at the battle site and the town of Haykashen in the Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] (modern-day Turkey). He named the region of the battle ''Hayk'', and the site of the battle Hayots Dzor.\n\n=== Ara the handsome ===\nAnother ancient Armenian legend is connected with Ara the beautiful, God of spring and rebirth.\n\nAccording to the legend, Shamiram had fallen in love with the handsome Ara and asked him to marry her. When Ara refused, Semiramis, in the heat of passion, gathered the armies of [[Assyria]] and marched against Armenia. During the battle Semiramis was victorious, but Ara was slain despite her orders to capture him alive. To avoid continuous warfare with the Armenians, Shamiram, reputed to be a sorceress, took his body and prayed to the gods to raise Ara from the dead. When the Armenians advanced to avenge their leader, Shamiram disguised one of her lovers as Ara and spread the rumor that the gods had brought Ara back to life, convincing the Armenians not to continue the war. Nevertheless, Ara is reborn later and gets his revenge on the Assyrian queen.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt was also reported that a village called Lezk, near [[Van, Turkey|Van]], traditionally held that it was Ara's place of resurrection.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== Torq Angegh ===\nTorq was considered one of [[Hayk]]'s great-grandsons and reportedly represented as an unattractive male figure. He is mentioned by Armenian 5th Century historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] and considered one of the significant deities of the Armenian pantheon. Taken in the context of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] religions, it is conceivable that an etymological connection with [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Thor]]/Tyr is more than a simple coincidence. According to tradition, with his immense strength he threw rocks at the invading Greek navy, keeping the shores of Armenia safe.\n\n== Relations with Christianity ==\n[[File:\u054a\u0561\u0580_\u0533\u0561\u057c\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574.jpg|thumb|A ritual dance at the Temple of Garni]]\nThe relations between the Armenian Native Faith movement and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] have been good and collaborative, since both share the common interest of protecting and promoting Armenian identity, especially against what are perceived as disruptive foreign forces infiltrating the country, such as Protestants, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mormonism|Mormons]].{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} The Armenian Apostolic Church generally sees Arordiners as allies. A high-ranking spokesman of the Armenian Apostolic Church declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian Church has an unequivocal stance on sectarians (i.e. Protestants et al.), but we do not interfere into hetanos affairs.}}\nSimilarly, the head of an Armenian institution catering to the victims of destructive cults declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian nation must remember its pre-Christian past, and Ara's Children help them remember. They also support the Armenian Apostolic Church in its fight against destructive sects.}}\nArmenian Native Faith believers' attitude towards Christianity oscillates between two positions: The critique of the religion's role in Armenian history, and the conditional acceptance of the Armenian Apostolic Church as a national institution.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} Christianity is criticised for having destroyed the rich and highly developed ancient Armenian culture, replacing the values of courage, martial spirit and honour with those of humility, obedience and modesty, thus causing the collapse of Armenian statehood and condemning the nation to centuries of subordination to foreign powers, migrations, persecutions and massacres.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} According to the strongest accusations, Christianity is responsible for the \"first genocide of the Armenians\", which coincided with its forceful introduction in the fourth century.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nAt the same time, the Armenian Apostolic Church is considered an institution peculiar to the Armenian nation, and the fruit of a synthesis of Christian and indigenous elements, in which the former represent just the surface. The hetanists find proof of this in the Church's prayers devoted to the Sun and light, in Church festivals overlapping indigenous Armenian festivals, and in the practice of ''matagh'', Christian animal sacrifice. Moreover, the hetanists believe that the Armenian alphabet, which Church historiography holds to have been invented by the monk Mesrop Mahtots, is actually an elaboration of ancient Armenian symbolism based on the motif of the ''[[swastika]]''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nHetanists generally do not have problems visiting Armenian churches and treating them as holy places, since many of them were built on the site of pre-Christian temples. Furthermore, some figures of the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church are revered as Hetanists in disguise: The ''[[Catholicos|catholicoi]]'' (high-ranking bishops) Vazgen I (in charge 1954\u20131994) and Garegin I (1995\u20131999). The former was a supporter of Nzhdeh and on his tombstone, instead of a cross, he has a letter of the Armenian alphabet which is considered a variant of the ''swastika'' and symbolic of seven Armenian gods. The latter is said to have visited Garni before his death and, despite being terminally ill, to have walked alone to the temple.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n<references group=\"\" responsive=\"0\"></references>\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n* {{cite contribution|last1=Siekierski|first1=Konrad|last2=Antonyan|first2=Yulia|year=2013|contribution=A Neopagan Movement in Armenia: the Children of Ara|title=Modern Pagan and Native Faith Movements in Central and Eastern Europe|editor1=Kaarina Aitamurto|editor2=Scott Simpson|isbn=9781844656622|location=Durham|publisher=Acumen|pages=266\u2013282|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2010|title='Re-creation' of a Religion: Neo-paganism in Armenia|url=https://www.academia.edu/191429|journal=Laboratorium|language=ru|location=Saint-Petersburg|pages=103\u2013128|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|language=hy|archivedate=16 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416201021/http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=|ref=harv|pages=23\u201330|isbn=9789993079934|first=Yulia|location=Yerevan|publisher=Lingva|url=http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|title=Identities and Changing World, Proceedings of International Conference|contribution=The Aryan Myth and the New Armenian Paganism|year=2008|author-mask={{long dash}}|url-status=dead}}\n\n; Armenian neoshamanism\n\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2008|contribution=Magical and Healing Practices in Contemporary Urban Environment (in Armenian Cities of Yerevan, Gyumri, and Vanadzor|title=Figuring the South Caucasus: Societies and Environment|publisher=Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation|location=Tbilisi|isbn=9789941900914|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2006|title=On the Name and Origins of 'Chopchi' Healing Practices|journal=Bulletin of Armenian Studies|pages=61\u201366|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2003|title=Pre-Christian Healers in a Christian Society|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|volume=27|ref=harv|number=2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://arordiukht.do.am/ Order of the Children of Ari] \u2014 official website\n* [http://www.hayary.org/ Armenian Aryan Congregation] \u2014 official website\n\n[[Category:Hetanism]]\n[[Category:Religion in ancient history]]\n[[Category:Religion in Armenia]]\n", "name_user": "BD2412", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eChristianity as state religion:Fixing links to disambiguation pages, improving links, other minor cleanup tasks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Native_Faith"}

It provides [[helicopter|rotary-wing]], [[tiltrotor]], and [[Fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing]] [[aircraft]], [[ground support equipment|support equipment]], pilots, maintenance personnel, as well as command and control assets to the commander.<ref>[http://hqinet001.hqmc.usmc.mil/AVN/ Marine Aviation homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806100030/http://hqinet001.hqmc.usmc.mil/AVN/ |date=2007-08-06 }}</ref> \n__TOC__\n\n==Role within the MAGTF==\nThe majority of aircraft usage within the MAGTF is for [[close air support]] or transport for the [[ground combat element]] (GCE) or [[logistics combat element]] (LCE), however, other specialized missions are available. The six main functions include: [[assault support]], [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-air warfare]], [[close air support|offensive air support]], [[electronic warfare]], [[Command and Control (Military)|control of aircraft and missiles]], and [[Reconnaissance|aerial reconnaissance]].<ref>{{cite news\n |title=MAWTS-1 hones warfighting edge \n |publisher=Naval Aviation News \n |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAX/is_6_84/ai_94262327 \n |accessdate=2007-04-01 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821151111/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAX/is_6_84/ai_94262327 \n |archivedate=2007-08-21 \n |url-status=live \n}}</ref>\n\nThe '''aviation combat element''' (ACE), which contributes the [[air power]] to the MAGTF, includes all aircraft ([[fixed-wing aircraft|fixed wing]], [[helicopter]]s, tiltrotor, and UAV) and aviation support units. The units are organized into detachments, squadrons, groups, and wings, except for low altitude air defense units, which are organized into platoons, detachments, batteries, and battalions. These units include [[aircraft pilot|pilots]], flight officers, enlisted aircrewmen, aviation logistics (aircraft [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], aviation electronics, aviation ordnance, and aviation supply) and Navy aviation medical and chaplain's corps personnel, as well as ground-based air defense units, and those units necessary for command and control (management and planning for manpower, intelligence, operations and training, and logistics functions), aviation command and control (tactical air command, air defense control, air support control, and air traffic control), communications, and aviation ground support (e.g., airfield services, bulk fuels/aircraft refueling, crash rescue, engineer construction and utilities support, EOD, motor transport, ground equipment supply and maintenance, local security/law enforcement, and the wing band).\n\n==Organization==\nThe size of the ACE varies in proportion to the size of the MAGTF. A [[Marine Expeditionary Force]] has a [[List of United States Marine Corps aircraft wings|Marine Aircraft Wing]] or MAW. A [[Marine Expeditionary Brigade]] holds a [[List of United States Marine Corps aircraft groups|Marine Aircraft Group]] or MAG, reinforced with a variety of aircraft squadrons and support personnel. The various [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s command a reinforced [[List of active United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons|squadron]], with various types of aircraft mixed into a single unit (known as a ''composite squadron'').\nGenerally, MEF postings are permanent, while MEBs and MEUs rotate their ACE, GCE, and LCE twice annually. 1st and 3rd Marine Aircraft Wings are unique in that they are subordinate to [[III MEF]] and [[I MEF]], respectively, while all other equivalent units numerical designators match the MEF to which attached.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Hierarchy of Marine Aviation units==\n\n===<center>[[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]]</center>===\n<center> ACE of [[III Marine Expeditionary Force]]\n[[File:USMC - 1MAW.png|center|200px]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- \n!

The six main functions include: [[assault support]], [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-air warfare]], [[close air support|offensive air support]], [[electronic warfare]], [[Command and Control (Military)|control of aircraft and missiles]], and [[Reconnaissance|aerial reconnaissance]].<ref>{{cite news\n |title=MAWTS-1 hones warfighting edge \n |publisher=Naval Aviation News \n |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAX/is_6_84/ai_94262327 \n |accessdate=2007-04-01 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821151111/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAX/is_6_84/ai_94262327 \n |archivedate=2007-08-21 \n |url-status=live \n}}</ref>\n\nThe '''aviation combat element''' (ACE), which contributes the [[air power]] to the MAGTF, includes all aircraft ([[fixed-wing aircraft|fixed wing]], [[helicopter]]s, tiltrotor, and UAV) and aviation support units. The units are organized into detachments, squadrons, groups, and wings, except for low altitude air defense units, which are organized into platoons, detachments, batteries, and battalions. These units include [[aircraft pilot|pilots]], flight officers, enlisted aircrewmen, aviation logistics (aircraft [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], aviation electronics, aviation ordnance, and aviation supply) and Navy aviation medical and chaplain's corps personnel, as well as ground-based air defense units, and those units necessary for command and control (management and planning for manpower, intelligence, operations and training, and logistics functions), aviation command and control (tactical air command, air defense control, air support control, and air traffic control), communications, and aviation ground support (e.g., airfield services, bulk fuels/aircraft refueling, crash rescue, engineer construction and utilities support, EOD, motor transport, ground equipment supply and maintenance, local security/law enforcement, and the wing band).\n\n==Organization==\nThe size of the ACE varies in proportion to the size of the MAGTF. A [[Marine Expeditionary Force]] has a [[List of United States Marine Corps aircraft wings|Marine Aircraft Wing]] or MAW. A [[Marine Expeditionary Brigade]] holds a [[List of United States Marine Corps aircraft groups|Marine Aircraft Group]] or MAG, reinforced with a variety of aircraft squadrons and support personnel. The various [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s command a reinforced [[List of active United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons|squadron]], with various types of aircraft mixed into a single unit (known as a ''composite squadron'').\nGenerally, MEF postings are permanent, while MEBs and MEUs rotate their ACE, GCE, and LCE twice annually. 1st and 3rd Marine Aircraft Wings are unique in that they are subordinate to [[III MEF]] and [[I MEF]], respectively, while all other equivalent units numerical designators match the MEF to which attached.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Hierarchy of Marine Aviation units==\n\n===<center>[[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]]</center>===\n<center> ACE of [[III Marine Expeditionary Force]]\n[[File:USMC - 1MAW.png|center|200px]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- \n!

The film, based on [[DC Comics]] characters, stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and provides a possible [[origin story]] for the character. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent counter-cultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying [[Gotham City]]. [[Robert De Niro]], [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Frances Conroy]], [[Brett Cullen]], [[Glenn Fleshler]], [[Bill Camp]], [[Shea Whigham]], and [[Marc Maron]] appear in supporting roles. ''Joker'' was produced by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[DC Films]], and Joint Effort, in association with [[Bron Studios|Bron Creative]] and [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], and distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nPhillips conceived ''Joker'' in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of [[Martin Scorsese]] (particularly ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]''), who was initially attached to the project as a producer. The graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' (1988) was the basis for the film's premise, but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration. Phoenix became attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by August. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[New York City]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], from September to December 2018. ''Joker'' is the first live-action [[Batman in film|theatrical ''Batman'' film]] to receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R-rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], due to its violent and disturbing content.\n\n''Joker'' premiered at the [[76th Venice International Film Festival]] on August 31, 2019, where it won the [[Golden Lion]], and was released in the United States on October 4, 2019. The film polarized critics; while it was highly praised for Phoenix's performance, the musical score, cinematography and production values, it was met with mixed reception concerning Phillips' screenplay and direction. The film's dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided opinion and also generated concerns of inspiring real-world violence; the movie theater where the [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting|2012 Aurora, Colorado mass shooting]] occurred during a screening of ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' refused to show it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|title=Why 'Joker' became one of the most divisive movies of the year|last=Cavna|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2019|website=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=October 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003213559/https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|archive-date=October 3, 2019}}</ref> Despite this, ''Joker'' became a major box office success, setting records for an October release. It has grossed over $1 billion, making it the first [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films|R-rated film]] to do so, the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films|31st-highest-grossing film]] of all time.\n\n''Joker'' received [[List of accolades received by Joker (2019 film)|numerous accolades]]. At the [[92nd Academy Awards]], the film earned a leading 11 nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Phoenix and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for [[Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir]]. Phoenix and Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir also won at the [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] and [[BAFTA Award]] ceremonies.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should generally be no more than 700 words. The current summary is 624 words.-->\nIn 1981, [[Clown|party clown]] and aspiring [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in [[Gotham City]]. Frequently teased and made fun of, Arthur is despondent of Gotham's ambiance, which is rife with crime and unemployment, leaving swathes of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from <!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM -->a medical disorder that causes him to laugh at uncomfortable and inappropriate times;<!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM --> he depends on social services for medication. After a gang of delinquents attacks Arthur in an alley, his co-worker, Randall, gives him a gun for protection. Arthur meets his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to his upcoming stand-up routine at a nightclub.\n\nWhile entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Despite his claim that the gun is a prop for his shows, Randall states it's real and lies to management that Arthur bought the gun himself and Arthur is fired. On the subway, still in his clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunken [[Wayne Enterprises]] businessmen; he shoots two in self-defense and executes the third. The killings are condemned by billionaire mayoral candidate [[Thomas Wayne]], who calls those envious of more successful people \"clowns.\" Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning clown masks in Arthur's image. Funding cuts shutter the social service program, leaving Arthur without his medication. All this results in Arthur having a mental breakdown, leading him to knock on Sophie's door and passionately kiss her, leading to a budding relationship.\n\nSophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably and has difficulty delivering his jokes. Popular talk show host Murray Franklin mocks Arthur by showing clips from the comedy routine on his show. Arthur intercepts a letter written by Penny to Thomas, alleging that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth. Arthur goes to [[Wayne Manor]], where he meets Thomas's young son [[Batman|Bruce]], but flees after a scuffle with the family butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. Following a visit from two [[Gotham City Police Department]] detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the train murders, Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized.\n\nAt a public event, Arthur confronts Thomas, who tells him that Penny is delusional and not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham State Hospital]] and steals Penny's case file; the file says Penny adopted Arthur as a baby and allowed her abusive boyfriend to harm them both. However, Penny says that Thomas used his influence to fabricate the adoption to hide their affair. Distraught, Arthur returns home and enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, Sophie tells him to leave and their previous encounters are revealed to be Arthur's delusions. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny with a pillow at the hospital.\n\nArthur is invited to appear on Murray's show due to the unexpected popularity of his comedy routine's clips. As he prepares, Arthur is visited by Randall and fellow ex-colleague Gary. Arthur brutally murders Randall but leaves Gary unharmed as he treated him well in the past. En{{nbsp}}route to the studio, Arthur is pursued by the two detectives onto a train filled with some of the clown protesters. One detective accidentally shoots a protester and incites a riot, allowing Arthur to escape.\n\nBefore the show goes live, Arthur requests that Murray introduce him as [[Joker (character)|Joker]], a reference to Murray's previous mockery. Arthur walks out to applause, but starts telling morbid jokes, confesses to the train murders, and rants about how society abandons the downtrodden and [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]].

The film, based on [[DC Comics]] characters, stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and provides a possible [[origin story]] for the character. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent counter-cultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying [[Gotham City]]. [[Robert De Niro]], [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Frances Conroy]], [[Brett Cullen]], [[Glenn Fleshler]], [[Bill Camp]], [[Shea Whigham]], and [[Marc Maron]] appear in supporting roles. ''Joker'' was produced by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[DC Films]], and Joint Effort, in association with [[Bron Studios|Bron Creative]] and [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], and distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nPhillips conceived ''Joker'' in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of [[Martin Scorsese]] (particularly ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]''), who was initially attached to the project as a producer. The graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' (1988) was the basis for the film's premise, but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration. Phoenix became attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by August. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[New York City]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], from September to December 2018. ''Joker'' is the first live-action [[Batman in film|theatrical ''Batman'' film]] to receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R-rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], due to its violent and disturbing content.\n\n''Joker'' premiered at the [[76th Venice International Film Festival]] on August 31, 2019, where it won the [[Golden Lion]], and was released in the United States on October 4, 2019. The film polarized critics; while it was highly praised for Phoenix's performance, the musical score, cinematography and production values, it was met with mixed reception concerning Phillips' screenplay and direction. The film's dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided opinion and also generated concerns of inspiring real-world violence; the movie theater where the [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting|2012 Aurora, Colorado mass shooting]] occurred during a screening of ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' refused to show it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|title=Why 'Joker' became one of the most divisive movies of the year|last=Cavna|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2019|website=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=October 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003213559/https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|archive-date=October 3, 2019}}</ref> Despite this, ''Joker'' became a major box office success, setting records for an October release. It has grossed over $1 billion, making it the first [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films|R-rated film]] to do so, the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films|31st-highest-grossing film]] of all time.\n\n''Joker'' received [[List of accolades received by Joker (2019 film)|numerous accolades]]. At the [[92nd Academy Awards]], the film earned a leading 11 nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Phoenix and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for [[Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir]].

The current summary is 624 words.-->\nIn 1981, [[Clown|party clown]] and aspiring [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in [[Gotham City]]. Frequently teased and made fun of, Arthur is despondent of Gotham's ambiance, which is rife with crime and unemployment, leaving swathes of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from <!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM -->a medical disorder that causes him to laugh at uncomfortable and inappropriate times;<!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM --> he depends on social services for medication. After a gang of delinquents attacks Arthur in an alley, his co-worker, Randall, gives him a gun for protection. Arthur meets his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to his upcoming stand-up routine at a nightclub.\n\nWhile entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Despite his claim that the gun is a prop for his shows, Randall states it's real and lies to management that Arthur bought the gun himself and Arthur is fired. On the subway, still in his clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunken [[Wayne Enterprises]] businessmen; he shoots two in self-defense and executes the third. The killings are condemned by billionaire mayoral candidate [[Thomas Wayne]], who calls those envious of more successful people \"clowns.\" Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning clown masks in Arthur's image. Funding cuts shutter the social service program, leaving Arthur without his medication. All this results in Arthur having a mental breakdown, leading him to knock on Sophie's door and passionately kiss her, leading to a budding relationship.\n\nSophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably and has difficulty delivering his jokes. Popular talk show host Murray Franklin mocks Arthur by showing clips from the comedy routine on his show. Arthur intercepts a letter written by Penny to Thomas, alleging that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth. Arthur goes to [[Wayne Manor]], where he meets Thomas's young son [[Batman|Bruce]], but flees after a scuffle with the family butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. Following a visit from two [[Gotham City Police Department]] detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the train murders, Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized.\n\nAt a public event, Arthur confronts Thomas, who tells him that Penny is delusional and not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham State Hospital]] and steals Penny's case file; the file says Penny adopted Arthur as a baby and allowed her abusive boyfriend to harm them both. However, Penny says that Thomas used his influence to fabricate the adoption to hide their affair. Distraught, Arthur returns home and enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, Sophie tells him to leave and their previous encounters are revealed to be Arthur's delusions. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny with a pillow at the hospital.\n\nArthur is invited to appear on Murray's show due to the unexpected popularity of his comedy routine's clips. As he prepares, Arthur is visited by Randall and fellow ex-colleague Gary. Arthur brutally murders Randall but leaves Gary unharmed as he treated him well in the past. En{{nbsp}}route to the studio, Arthur is pursued by the two detectives onto a train filled with some of the clown protesters. One detective accidentally shoots a protester and incites a riot, allowing Arthur to escape.\n\nBefore the show goes live, Arthur requests that Murray introduce him as [[Joker (character)|Joker]], a reference to Murray's previous mockery.

Masvidal developed an interest in mysticism and esoteric topics from a young age, becoming an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and eventually a practitioner of [[Buddhist meditation]] by his late 20s. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] In Miami, where the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups, Crypha and Seaweed. \n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Cynic (1988 - 1995, first hiatus) ===\n{{Main articles|Cynic (band)}}\n[[File:Masvidal with Death - Human era.jpg|200x200px|alt=|left|border]]\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.

Even in the alternative rock scene, where such voices are replete, his stands above in its emotional impact. Couple this with layered, acoustic guitars, haunting, rusty synths where needed and drumming which ties the whole thing into a neat, digestible package and you get Aeon Spoke.
