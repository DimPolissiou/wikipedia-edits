He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].

He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Biden is the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|presumptive Democratic nominee]] for [[President of the United States|president]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]. In January 2017, Obama awarded Biden the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] with distinction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-presidential-medal-freedom.html|title=Obama Surprises Joe Biden With Presidential Medal of Freedom|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=January 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref> After completing his second term as vice president, Biden joined the faculty of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was named the [[Benjamin Franklin]] Professor of Presidential Practice.<ref name=\"BidenUPenn\">{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-has-a-new-job-2017-2 |title=Here's what Joe Biden will do after 8 years as vice president |last=Berke |first=Jeremy |date=February 7, 2017 |website=Business Insider |access-date=February 8, 2017 |quote=}}</ref> He announced his [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|2020 candidacy for president]] on April 25, 2019, joining a large [[2020 Democratic Party presidential candidates|field of Democratic candidates]] pursuing the party nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/us/politics/biden-2020.html|title=Joe Biden's 2020 Plan Is Almost Complete.

In the film, high schooler Bird Fitcher finds a vintage Polaroid camera that holds dark and mysterious secrets. She soon realizes that those who get their picture taken by it meet a tragic death. It stars [[Kathryn Prescott]], [[Samantha Logan]], [[Tyler Young (actor)|Tyler Young]], and [[Javier Botet]].\n\n[[Dimension Films]] announced the film in 2015, with Klevberg set to direct and Blair Butler writing the script. [[Principal photography]]\u00a0began in\u00a0[[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] on March 9, 2017, and was completed in May 2017. The film was originally set to be released in August 2017, but was rescheduled several times. By October 2018, [[Lantern Entertainment]], which acquired [[The Weinstein Company]]/Dimension's assets through its bankruptcy, and 13 Films, an international distribution and finance company, had struck a deal to co-distribute the film internationally.\n\nPolaroid was theatrically released in Germany on January 10, 2019, by Wild Bunch, and in the United Kingdom on June 1, 2019. It was released in the United States on September 17, 2019, in select theatres and on VOD, by [[Vertical Entertainment]], before streaming on [[Netflix]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ihorror.com/long-awaited-polaroid-will-finally-be-released-in-september/|title=Long-Awaited 'Polaroid' will Finally be Released in September|first=Waylon|last=Jordan|date=August 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://1428elm.com/2020/02/16/polaroid-3-reasons/|title=3 Reasons Netflix\u2019s Polaroid is a must watch horror film|date=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThis MoVIE IS NOT DEMONICSarah and her friend are going through a box of her late mother's stuff when they find a Polaroid camera. The friend received a \u201clike\u201d from her crush, which provokes Sarah to take a photo in lingerie on the Polaroid camera. When the flash goes off, Sarah seems uneasy. Her friend leaves, and Sarah is home alone. When she takes a look at the Polaroid, there is a creepy shadow behind her in the photo of her. Startled, she treats it as a smudge and starts cleaning. She hears eerie sounds in the attic, which she investigates. She gets frightened in the attic and falls, but ends up dangling by her ankles instead of falling to the floor. While feeling a brief moment of relief as her hair dangles in her face, she is then pulled up by an entity and is killed offscreen before her dead body tumbles to the ground.\n\nShy high school student Bird is given an old [[Polaroid camera]] by her co-worker Tyler, who got it from a garage sale. The camera has the initials \u201cRJS\u201d carved into it. Bird snaps a picture of Tyler but later notices an odd smudge-like figure on his photo.\n\nBird attends a costume party with her best friend Kasey and meets her other friends Mina, Mina's boyfriend Devin, Avery, and Bird's high school crush Connor. She uses her Polaroid camera to take the group's picture and Avery later snaps a selfie with it. Meanwhile, Tyler is killed by the entity, and Sheriff Pembroke informs Bird. At home, Bird sees Tyler's photo free from the shadow, which has mysteriously transferred to Avery's photo.\n\nAvery is killed when the entity snaps her neck. When Bird learns about this, she tries to destroy the camera and attempts to warn her friends. Devin attempts to burn the group photo, but when the flames reach Mina in the photo, her arm spontaneously combusts and the flames cannot be extinguished. Kasey's fingers are slightly singed before Bird stomps out the fire and the photograph restores itself. Mina is taken to the hospital to undergo surgery for her arm; Devin and Kasey stay with her while Bird and Connor leave to learn more about the camera. Bird and Connor research and discover that the camera was owned by a photography teacher Roland Joseph Sable (RJS) from their school years ago. He was accused of torturing four students and killing three of them while taking maniacal photographs. One of the captives escaped and Roland was killed by police. Bird is attacked by the entity, which behaves like a photograph: following the same rules as photographic development (i.e. it is sensitive to heat). She questions why she was chased too and notices that her reflection is in the photo's background. \n\nMina is killed at the hospital by the entity when she is left alone briefly. Devin finds Mina's dead body and blames Bird for her death. Devin confronts Bird at the diner and accuses her of being responsible for what happened to Mina. He attempts to take a picture of her as a threat. With Connor and Devin both fighting for the camera, Devin is accidentally snapped by the camera and the shadow transfers to his photo, showing he is next. Devin lunges at Bird, Kasey saves Bird by stabbing Devin's photo with a pencil, injuring him in real life. Devin upset from being stabbed becomes aggressive and accidentally slaps a sheriff named Pembroke. Devin is detained and is later killed in his cell by the entity.\n\nConnor, Kasey, and Bird learn Roland's wife is alive and visit her. They meet an elderly lady named Lena Sable, who explains that the camera actually belonged to her daughter Rebecca Jane Sable (RJS). Lena explains that Rebecca was \"slow,\" and when gifted with the camera she became very attached to it. As a result, Rebecca was bullied by four classmates, who took the camera and used it to take inappropriate photos of her. She committed suicide out of shame, causing her father Roland to abduct and kill her bullies in a fit of rage. Now even in death, Roland roams, looking for the last bully who escaped to kill him. Lena shows the two a picture of the survivor and they search the yearbooks. Bird finds out that the survivor was Sheriff Pembroke. In an attempt to stop the entity from killing them, Connor takes a picture of Pembroke, who reveals that Roland was the real bully to Rebecca, having sexually assaulted her. The four students, including him, were Rebecca's friends trying to warn her of her father's actions upon finding her nude pictures in his possession. Fearing the public would find out, Roland abducted them, prompting Rebecca to kill herself in fear. \n\nThe entity tears Pembroke's picture in half, killing him. The entity stabs through Kasey's leg, impairing her ability to walk. Connor is separated from Kasey and Bird; the girls find safety in the school's showers, with Bird turning on the hot water to create heat, preventing the entity from reaching them. Bird leaves to find Connor, they reunite and she has an idea that involves getting the camera back (having been left where Sheriff Pembroke was killed) and going somewhere where the entity can \"fully develop.\" The entity manifests and drags Connor away, but Bird takes a picture of herself, prompting the creature to chase after her. She leads the entity into the school's dark room, where it is able to fully develop. She takes a picture of the entity, crushes the photo trying to kill it. Unsuccessful and fearing for her life she then burns it last minute, disintegrating the entity where everything took place many years ago.

The friend received a \u201clike\u201d from her crush, which provokes Sarah to take a photo in lingerie on the Polaroid camera. When the flash goes off, Sarah seems uneasy. Her friend leaves, and Sarah is home alone. When she takes a look at the Polaroid, there is a creepy shadow behind her in the photo of her. Startled, she treats it as a smudge and starts cleaning. She hears eerie sounds in the attic, which she investigates. She gets frightened in the attic and falls, but ends up dangling by her ankles instead of falling to the floor. While feeling a brief moment of relief as her hair dangles in her face, she is then pulled up by an entity and is killed offscreen before her dead body tumbles to the ground.\n\nShy high school student Bird is given an old [[Polaroid camera]] by her co-worker Tyler, who got it from a garage sale. The camera has the initials \u201cRJS\u201d carved into it. Bird snaps a picture of Tyler but later notices an odd smudge-like figure on his photo.\n\nBird attends a costume party with her best friend Kasey and meets her other friends Mina, Mina's boyfriend Devin, Avery, and Bird's high school crush Connor. She uses her Polaroid camera to take the group's picture and Avery later snaps a selfie with it. Meanwhile, Tyler is killed by the entity, and Sheriff Pembroke informs Bird. At home, Bird sees Tyler's photo free from the shadow, which has mysteriously transferred to Avery's photo.\n\nAvery is killed when the entity snaps her neck. When Bird learns about this, she tries to destroy the camera and attempts to warn her friends. Devin attempts to burn the group photo, but when the flames reach Mina in the photo, her arm spontaneously combusts and the flames cannot be extinguished. Kasey's fingers are slightly singed before Bird stomps out the fire and the photograph restores itself. Mina is taken to the hospital to undergo surgery for her arm; Devin and Kasey stay with her while Bird and Connor leave to learn more about the camera. Bird and Connor research and discover that the camera was owned by a photography teacher Roland Joseph Sable (RJS) from their school years ago. He was accused of torturing four students and killing three of them while taking maniacal photographs. One of the captives escaped and Roland was killed by police. Bird is attacked by the entity, which behaves like a photograph: following the same rules as photographic development (i.e. it is sensitive to heat). She questions why she was chased too and notices that her reflection is in the photo's background. \n\nMina is killed at the hospital by the entity when she is left alone briefly. Devin finds Mina's dead body and blames Bird for her death. Devin confronts Bird at the diner and accuses her of being responsible for what happened to Mina. He attempts to take a picture of her as a threat. With Connor and Devin both fighting for the camera, Devin is accidentally snapped by the camera and the shadow transfers to his photo, showing he is next. Devin lunges at Bird, Kasey saves Bird by stabbing Devin's photo with a pencil, injuring him in real life. Devin upset from being stabbed becomes aggressive and accidentally slaps a sheriff named Pembroke. Devin is detained and is later killed in his cell by the entity.\n\nConnor, Kasey, and Bird learn Roland's wife is alive and visit her. They meet an elderly lady named Lena Sable, who explains that the camera actually belonged to her daughter Rebecca Jane Sable (RJS). Lena explains that Rebecca was \"slow,\" and when gifted with the camera she became very attached to it. As a result, Rebecca was bullied by four classmates, who took the camera and used it to take inappropriate photos of her. She committed suicide out of shame, causing her father Roland to abduct and kill her bullies in a fit of rage. Now even in death, Roland roams, looking for the last bully who escaped to kill him. Lena shows the two a picture of the survivor and they search the yearbooks. Bird finds out that the survivor was Sheriff Pembroke. In an attempt to stop the entity from killing them, Connor takes a picture of Pembroke, who reveals that Roland was the real bully to Rebecca, having sexually assaulted her. The four students, including him, were Rebecca's friends trying to warn her of her father's actions upon finding her nude pictures in his possession. Fearing the public would find out, Roland abducted them, prompting Rebecca to kill herself in fear. \n\nThe entity tears Pembroke's picture in half, killing him. The entity stabs through Kasey's leg, impairing her ability to walk. Connor is separated from Kasey and Bird; the girls find safety in the school's showers, with Bird turning on the hot water to create heat, preventing the entity from reaching them. Bird leaves to find Connor, they reunite and she has an idea that involves getting the camera back (having been left where Sheriff Pembroke was killed) and going somewhere where the entity can \"fully develop.\" The entity manifests and drags Connor away, but Bird takes a picture of herself, prompting the creature to chase after her. She leads the entity into the school's dark room, where it is able to fully develop. She takes a picture of the entity, crushes the photo trying to kill it. Unsuccessful and fearing for her life she then burns it last minute, disintegrating the entity where everything took place many years ago. She reunites with her friends and throws the camera into a river.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kathryn Prescott]] as Bird Fitcher\n* [[Tyler Young (actor)|Tyler Young]] as Connor Bell\n* [[Samantha Logan]] as Kasey Walters\n* Keenan Tracey as Devin Lane\n* Priscilla Quintana as Mina Rodriguez\n* [[Javier Botet]] as The Entity\n* [[Mitch Pileggi]] as Thomas Pembroke\n* [[Katie Stevens]] as Avery Bishop\n* [[Davi Santos]] as Tyler Drew\n* [[Shauna MacDonald]] as Mrs. Fitcher \n* [[Grace Zabriskie]] as Lena Sable\n* Rhys Bevan John as Roland Joseph Sable\n* Emily Power as Rebecca Sable\n* [[Madelaine Petsch]] as Sarah Dawson\n* Erika Prevost as Linda Vu\n\n==Production==\n[[Dimension Films]] spearheaded the feature, an adaptation of the 2015 short film ''Polaroid'', written and directed by Norwegian director Lars Klevberg, who also directed the full length version.

Regularly broadcast since 1990, it is loosely based on the [[BBC Radio 4]] show ''[[The News Quiz]]'' and has a topical and [[satirical]] remit.\n\n''Have I Got News for You'' is often cited as beginning the increasing domination of panel shows in British TV comedy, and remains one of the genre's key standard-bearers. In recognition of this, the show received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2011 [[British Comedy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Winners|url=http://www.britishcomedyawards.com/winners-2011.aspx|publisher=The British Comedy Academy|accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref> It was the first time the honour had been bestowed upon a collective instead of an individual or double act. In 2016 they also received a [[BAFTA]] in the Comedy and Comedy Entertainment Programme category.\n\nThe programme was shown on [[BBC Two]] for its first ten years, before moving to [[BBC One]]. The [[UKTV]] channel [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] carries regular repeats of the show.  The programme is in its 59th series.\n\n==Format==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2019}}\n[[Image:HIGNFY Studio 2019.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Have I Got News for You'' studio]]\n''Have I Got News for You'' began on [[BBC2]] on 28 September 1990 and transferred to [[BBC One]] in October 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098820/?ref_=nv_sr_1 |title=Have I Got News For You |publisher=IMDB |date=2017 |accessdate= 2 March 2017}}</ref> \"Myself and Ian, we did a disastrous pilot for it,\" Paul Merton said nine years later.<ref name=\"South Bank Show\">''[[The South Bank Show]]'', 26 September 1999</ref> \"It was a beautiful summer's afternoon in 1990. Far too nice to be in a television studio, but I think the BBC had already bought it, so that's how it became a series.\"\n\nTwo series are made every year. At first, the number of episodes per series was inconsistent. However, a pattern soon formed at the start of series 3 in 1992 whereby the spring series between April and June comprises eight episodes and the autumn series from October to December contains nine, with a one-week break in the middle to allow the broadcasting of [[Children in Need]].\n\nFor its first 10 years, the programme was shown on [[BBC Two]]. In 2000, the BBC moved its nightly [[BBC One]] news bulletin, the ''[[BBC Nine O'Clock News]]'', from nine o'clock to ten o'clock (now known as the ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'') after [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] moved their long-running ten o'clock bulletin, [[ITV News at Ten|''News at Ten'']], to eleven o'clock. This left a gap in the schedules, and ''Have I Got News for You'' was moved as a result to 9pm on Friday nights on BBC One.\n\nThe 39th series, broadcast in early 2010, moved the show to a Thursday night slot. The 40th series remained in this new time slot, despite one episode being broadcast the day after due to the [[Royal Variety Performance]]; both series featured an extra episode, with the spring series now featuring 9 episodes and the autumn series 10 episodes.\n\nOver an hour's worth of material is recorded for each 30-minute programme for broadcast the following day, allowing the programme to remain topical while the BBC's lawyers have time to request cuts of potentially defamatory material. As for its popularity, Merton explained that it was mostly [[word-of-mouth]]:  \"No reviewer could possibly review it in that time. We started off with an audience of two million, and somebody might have mentioned it to their friend, and then it sort of built up a momentum of its own.\"<ref name=\"South Bank Show\"/>\n\nThe late-night weekend repeat has occasionally contained extra material from the week's recording. This became a permanent feature from the spring 2007 series, with the repeat having a running time of 40 minutes, and being titled (in the TV listings) ''Have I Got a Bit More News for You''.<ref name=\"chortle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/04/11/5212/a_lot_more_news_for_you |title=A lot more news for you : News 2007 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide |publisher=Chortle |date=2007-04-11 |accessdate=2017-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally recorded at [[the London Studios]], former home of [[London Weekend Television]], and as of the start of the autumn 2018 season (Series 56, episode 1) <ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bmgc4m |title=HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU; BBC1 Listings |publisher=BBC |date=2018-05-18 |accessdate=2018-05-18}}</ref> recording has now been moved to [[Elstree Studios]].<ref name=\"SRO Audiences\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sroaudiences.com/ |title=HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU - Free audience tickets: SRO Audiences : the tv audience company |publisher=SRO Audiences |date=2018-05-18 |accessdate=2018-05-18}}</ref> The [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 Election]] special episode was recorded at [[BBC Television Centre]] on the Friday morning after the election. The quiz aspect and scores are largely ignored in favour of the panellists' witty exchanges and jokes, and the format seems to change frequently.\n\n\"There's been a lot of confusion, with people saying, 'Well, they see the questions beforehand,' which we do,\" revealed Merton in 1999. \"But some people say we see the ''answers'', which we don't, because that would rob it of being a quiz.\"<ref name=\"South Bank Show\"/>\n\n\"There is a certain amount of show business that goes on in putting on a show,\" continued Merton. \"We found very early on that it's worth seeing the questions beforehand so that you can work out your depth of ignorance. If you really don't know, you think, 'Well, I've really got to try and say something here.' It's much better to be doing that for ten or fifteen minutes before the show than be doing it when the cameras are rolling, in front of an audience, going, 'Well, who's he?'\"<ref name=\"South Bank Show\"/>\n\n[[Norman Tebbit]] wrote an article in ''[[Daily Mail|The Mail on Sunday]]'' criticising the whole programme: 'Well, of course ''Have I Got News for You'' is all edited. These people, they couldn't improvise live. You put them on a stage, they wouldn't be able to improvise.' Merton said of this: \"Well, when Norman Tebbit said I couldn't improvise, I was... [''blows out cheeks and then goes silent''].\"<ref>Quote taken from a show on Merton's \"and this is me PAUL MERTON\" tour of 1999, as featured in ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' on 26 September 1999</ref>\n\n===Main section===\nThe main section of the show comprises several rounds, although, as noted above, this is liable to change. Since the show originally aired, several rounds have been dropped from the original format, but a typical show will usually consist of the following:\n* Round 1 is the \"Film Round\". Silent video clips, usually from news reports, are played to the teams. Two points are awarded for correctly identifying the story \u2013 but as the round covers the major stories of the week, the quiz aspect is downplayed here in favour of discussion and banter. The host will still ask questions to highlight details of a story, but no further points are awarded for the answers.\n** Sometimes, the clips used have been specially chosen from particular sources, such as in the 2008 Christmas special, which used clips from Christmas specials of various other TV programmes to provide the clues. The 1993 'Thatcher special' presented a slight variation called ''Who Dares Loses?'', where the teams had to identify who in the clip 'lost'.\n** On rare occasions, sound is added to the clip, such as a \"[[wikt:kerching|ker-ching]]\" in the montage that depicted the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 MPs' expenses scandal]] or the ''[[Blue Peter]]'' theme tune in the week that presenter [[Richard Bacon (TV presenter)|Richard Bacon]] had been caught taking drugs.\n** The only occasion that the video clip element of this round has been deviated from was during series 37, when one of the clips was audio only with no pictures. The question was about [[the Hum]], which none of the panel could hear anyway.\n** Early series featured two similar games later in the show; the \"Connections Round\", with the panel identifying the individuals and the story that linked them, and the \"Archive Round\", featuring pre-1990 news footage in a 'what happened next?' format. Both were dropped as the more popular rounds began to use up more time.\n* Round 2 was originally the \"Tabloid Headlines Round\", in which the panellists identified and commented on the more flippant stories of the week from sufficiently pun-filled [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] headlines.\n** Another of the original rounds later dropped was the similar \"Mini-Headlines Round\", where the panel had to identify a story from the four words used in the original tabloid report as effective chapter headings.\n** In 2004, the headlines were filtered out and replaced with a picture game. An image is slowly revealed to the teams, the object being for one to buzz in before the other and guess how the resulting person or object is relevant to the week's news. Originally this took the form of the \"Picture-Spin Quiz\". Regular variants since have included the \"[[Jigsaw puzzle|Jigsaw]] of News\" and the Christmas-themed \"[[Giblets]] of News\", while others have featured wieldy props for the host, such as the \"[[Wheel of Fortune (UK game show)|Wheel]] of News\", the \"[[Slot machine|One-Armed Bandit]] of News\" and the \"[[High striker|Strengthometer]] of News\". A few versions have been more specific to that week's guest host; e.g. [[Dominic West]], star of American cop drama ''[[The Wire]]'', had the \"[[Police car|Squad Car]] of News\".\n** Occasionally the round is themed around one topic. In these instances, it usually becomes a more straightforward Q&A 'fingers-on-[[buzzer]]s' round.\n** Another slight variation is a spoof of an existing quiz/gameshow, often done when pertinent to the current guests. For example; a mock ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'' game when [[Magnus Magnusson]] appeared or the infamous \"Play Your Iraqi Cards Right\" from [[Bruce Forsyth]]'s first time as host, which took the format of [[Play Your Cards Right|the presenter's former game show]], as well as referencing a [[Most-wanted Iraqi playing cards|special deck of cards]] produced by the Americans for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].\n* Round 3 is the \"Odd One Out Round\", where four personalities, characters and/or objects are presented to a team, whereupon they must identify the interloper, and the topical, amusing or ridiculously obscure link between the other three. In one episode, Merton's \"Odd One Out\" selection consisted of 16 images and in another, the round comprised four photos of [[Michael Howard]]. On another occasion the four choices were Hislop, Merton and both guests, [[Germaine Greer]] and [[Charles Kennedy]]. The four pictures used were the live remote feeds from the studio cameras. (This technique was also used in an episode hosted by [[Ronnie Corbett]], when the comedian featured as one of the choices.) One week, after it had been revealed that a group of celebrities had taken out [[gag order|press injunctions]], the round consisted of four blanked out images, with the host, Rhod Gilbert, explaining that they were unable to reveal who exactly was the odd one out, or the reason.\n** A short-lived variant was another take on the aforementioned \"Connections Round\", with images of three people given, the teams working out what linked them.\n** When Bruce Forsyth was host, this round was replaced by \"Conveyer Belt Connections\", a reference to the final round of ''[[The Generation Game]]''. One of the belts consisted of people and objects whose resulting connection was that they had all been the Odd One Out in previous editions of the show. This included the disparate grouping together of [[sewage|raw sewage]], ''[[The Hay Wain]]'', [[Tinky Winky]] and [[Osama bin Laden]].\n* Round 4 is the \"Missing Words Round\", where newspaper headlines are displayed, with choice words blanked out. The panellists then suggest what these could be. Since 1994, a regular feature of this round is that some of the banners are taken from that week's choice of obscure \"guest publication\". Over the years, these have included ''Goat World'', ''Arthritis News'', ''International Car Park Design'', \"The Caravan Times\" and ''Diarrhoea Digest''. Examples of Missing Words are \"I'll take Edward up the _____\", \"Church may be forced to sell _____\" and \"PM sucked into _____\".\n* After the final scores are read out, there is often an additional Caption Competition, where potentially amusing pictures are shown, to which the panellists are invited to provide an apt headline. No points are awarded for this section.\n\n==Participants==\n\nThe original line-up, from 1990 to 2002, was [[Angus Deayton]] as chairman, with [[Ian Hislop]], the editor of ''[[Private Eye]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/ian-hislop-my-20-years-at-the-eye-421312.html |title=Ian Heslop: My 20 Years at the Eye |newspaper=Independent |date=2007 |accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> and comedian [[Paul Merton]] as team captains. Each captain was accompanied by a guest, usually a [[politician]], [[journalist]] or [[comedian]], or somebody particularly relevant to recent news.\n\nMerton took a break from ''Have I Got News for You'' during the 11th series in 1996, making only one appearance as a guest on Hislop's team. He was variously replaced as opposing team captain by [[Clive Anderson]], [[Alan Davies]] and [[Eddie Izzard]] (with another two episodes featuring an equal-billing [[double act]] as the opponents of Hislop's team). Merton later explained that at the time he was \"very tired\" of the show and that he thought it had become \"stuck in a rut\". Nevertheless, he added that he felt his absence gave the programme the \"shot in the arm\" it needed and that it had been \"better ever since\".<ref group=note>''The Very Best of Have I Got News for You'' (2002): DVD commentary</ref>\n\nIn May 2002, following newspaper headlines of his sex with a prostitute and use of illegal drugs,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1998242.stm |title=Deayton 'feels a fool' over reports |work=BBC News |date=20 May 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Deayton was relentlessly ridiculed on the show by Hislop and Merton (along with guests [[Dave Gorman]] and [[Ken Livingstone]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2005881.stm |title=Deayton in the lion's den |work=BBC News |date=24 May 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Following a second round of revelations about his private life later in the year, leading to further mockery, Deayton was fired in October, two shows into series 24.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2373711.stm |title=Quiz host Deayton fired by BBC |work=BBC News |date=30 October 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt short notice, Merton hosted the first episode after Deayton's departure, and was described as \"merciless\" in his treatment of his former co-star.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2384165.stm |title=Show goes on after Deayton exit |work=BBC News |date=1 November 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> A series of guest hosts appeared for the remainder of the series, including [[Anne Robinson]], [[Boris Johnson]], and [[Jeremy Clarkson]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/12_december/07/news_clarkson.shtml |work=BBC Press Office |title=HIGNFY Jeremy Clarkson |publisher=BBC |date=7 December 2002 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref> Despite an initial search for a permanent successor to Deayton, having a different guest host each week proved successful, with average audience figures increasing from 6 million to 7 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2984669.stm |title=TV quiz denies Clunes is new host |work=BBC News |date=29 April 2003 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> It was therefore announced in June 2003 that this feature would continue permanently.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jason |last=Deans |first2=Chris |last2=Tryhorn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jun/10/broadcasting.bbc |title=Forsyth boost for BBC news quiz |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=10 June 2003 |accessdate=15 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nHislop is the only person to have appeared in every episode \u2014 despite suffering from [[appendicitis]] during one 1994 edition and having to go to [[hospital]] immediately afterwards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/?page_id=338 |title=\"I Hope the Lawyers Are Getting All This!\" \u2014 The ''Have I Got News For You'' Story |publisher=Off the Telly |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608045207/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/?page_id=338 |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nApart from Merton, there are twelve other people who have appeared as a panellist after being a guest host: [[Clive Anderson]], [[Gyles Brandreth]], [[Marcus Brigstocke]], [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[Alan Johnson]] (both of whom subsequently appeared as a guest host again), [[Charles Kennedy]], [[Richard Madeley]], [[Richard Osman]], [[Robert Peston]], [[John Prescott]] and [[Liza Tarbuck]].

They play some of the same games including fill in the missing headline, however many games are off limits due to their visual nature.

Regularly broadcast since 1990, it is loosely based on the [[BBC Radio 4]] show ''[[The News Quiz]]'' and has a topical and [[satirical]] remit.\n\n''Have I Got News for You'' is often cited as beginning the increasing domination of panel shows in British TV comedy, and remains one of the genre's key standard-bearers. In recognition of this, the show received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2011 [[British Comedy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Winners|url=http://www.britishcomedyawards.com/winners-2011.aspx|publisher=The British Comedy Academy|accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref> It was the first time the honour had been bestowed upon a collective instead of an individual or double act. In 2016 they also received a [[BAFTA]] in the Comedy and Comedy Entertainment Programme category.\n\nThe programme was shown on [[BBC Two]] for its first ten years, before moving to [[BBC One]]. The [[UKTV]] channel [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] carries regular repeats of the show.  The programme is in its 59th series. \n\n==Format==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2019}}\n[[Image:HIGNFY Studio 2019.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Have I Got News for You'' studio]]\n''Have I Got News for You'' began on [[BBC2]] on 28 September 1990 and transferred to [[BBC One]] in October 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098820/?ref_=nv_sr_1 |title=Have I Got News For You |publisher=IMDB |date=2017 |accessdate= 2 March 2017}}</ref> \"Myself and Ian, we did a disastrous pilot for it,\" Paul Merton said nine years later.<ref name=\"South Bank Show\">''[[The South Bank Show]]'', 26 September 1999</ref> \"It was a beautiful summer's afternoon in 1990. Far too nice to be in a television studio, but I think the BBC had already bought it, so that's how it became a series.\"\n\nTwo series are made every year. At first, the number of episodes per series was inconsistent. However, a pattern soon formed at the start of series 3 in 1992 whereby the spring series between April and June comprises eight episodes and the autumn series from October to December contains nine, with a one-week break in the middle to allow the broadcasting of [[Children in Need]].\n\nFor its first 10 years, the programme was shown on [[BBC Two]]. In 2000, the BBC moved its nightly [[BBC One]] news bulletin, the ''[[BBC Nine O'Clock News]]'', from nine o'clock to ten o'clock (now known as the ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'') after [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] moved their long-running ten o'clock bulletin, [[ITV News at Ten|''News at Ten'']], to eleven o'clock. This left a gap in the schedules, and ''Have I Got News for You'' was moved as a result to 9pm on Friday nights on BBC One.\n\nThe 39th series, broadcast in early 2010, moved the show to a Thursday night slot. The 40th series remained in this new time slot, despite one episode being broadcast the day after due to the [[Royal Variety Performance]]; both series featured an extra episode, with the spring series now featuring 9 episodes and the autumn series 10 episodes.\n\nOver an hour's worth of material is recorded for each 30-minute programme for broadcast the following day, allowing the programme to remain topical while the BBC's lawyers have time to request cuts of potentially defamatory material. As for its popularity, Merton explained that it was mostly [[word-of-mouth]]:  \"No reviewer could possibly review it in that time. We started off with an audience of two million, and somebody might have mentioned it to their friend, and then it sort of built up a momentum of its own.\"<ref name=\"South Bank Show\"/>\n\nThe late-night weekend repeat has occasionally contained extra material from the week's recording. This became a permanent feature from the spring 2007 series, with the repeat having a running time of 40 minutes, and being titled (in the TV listings) ''Have I Got a Bit More News for You''.<ref name=\"chortle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/04/11/5212/a_lot_more_news_for_you |title=A lot more news for you : News 2007 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide |publisher=Chortle |date=2007-04-11 |accessdate=2017-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally recorded at [[the London Studios]], former home of [[London Weekend Television]], and as of the start of the autumn 2018 season (Series 56, episode 1) <ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bmgc4m |title=HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU; BBC1 Listings |publisher=BBC |date=2018-05-18 |accessdate=2018-05-18}}</ref> recording has now been moved to [[Elstree Studios]].<ref name=\"SRO Audiences\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sroaudiences.com/ |title=HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU - Free audience tickets: SRO Audiences : the tv audience company |publisher=SRO Audiences |date=2018-05-18 |accessdate=2018-05-18}}</ref> The [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 Election]] special episode was recorded at [[BBC Television Centre]] on the Friday morning after the election. The quiz aspect and scores are largely ignored in favour of the panellists' witty exchanges and jokes, and the format seems to change frequently.\n\n\"There's been a lot of confusion, with people saying, 'Well, they see the questions beforehand,' which we do,\" revealed Merton in 1999. \"But some people say we see the ''answers'', which we don't, because that would rob it of being a quiz.\"<ref name=\"South Bank Show\"/>\n\n\"There is a certain amount of show business that goes on in putting on a show,\" continued Merton. \"We found very early on that it's worth seeing the questions beforehand so that you can work out your depth of ignorance. If you really don't know, you think, 'Well, I've really got to try and say something here.' It's much better to be doing that for ten or fifteen minutes before the show than be doing it when the cameras are rolling, in front of an audience, going, 'Well, who's he?'\"<ref name=\"South Bank Show\"/>\n\n[[Norman Tebbit]] wrote an article in ''[[Daily Mail|The Mail on Sunday]]'' criticising the whole programme: 'Well, of course ''Have I Got News for You'' is all edited. These people, they couldn't improvise live. You put them on a stage, they wouldn't be able to improvise.' Merton said of this: \"Well, when Norman Tebbit said I couldn't improvise, I was... [''blows out cheeks and then goes silent''].\"<ref>Quote taken from a show on Merton's \"and this is me PAUL MERTON\" tour of 1999, as featured in ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' on 26 September 1999</ref>\n\n===Main section===\nThe main section of the show comprises several rounds, although, as noted above, this is liable to change. Since the show originally aired, several rounds have been dropped from the original format, but a typical show will usually consist of the following:\n* Round 1 is the \"Film Round\". Silent video clips, usually from news reports, are played to the teams. Two points are awarded for correctly identifying the story \u2013 but as the round covers the major stories of the week, the quiz aspect is downplayed here in favour of discussion and banter. The host will still ask questions to highlight details of a story, but no further points are awarded for the answers.\n** Sometimes, the clips used have been specially chosen from particular sources, such as in the 2008 Christmas special, which used clips from Christmas specials of various other TV programmes to provide the clues. The 1993 'Thatcher special' presented a slight variation called ''Who Dares Loses?'', where the teams had to identify who in the clip 'lost'.\n** On rare occasions, sound is added to the clip, such as a \"[[wikt:kerching|ker-ching]]\" in the montage that depicted the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 MPs' expenses scandal]] or the ''[[Blue Peter]]'' theme tune in the week that presenter [[Richard Bacon (TV presenter)|Richard Bacon]] had been caught taking drugs.\n** The only occasion that the video clip element of this round has been deviated from was during series 37, when one of the clips was audio only with no pictures. The question was about [[the Hum]], which none of the panel could hear anyway.\n** Early series featured two similar games later in the show; the \"Connections Round\", with the panel identifying the individuals and the story that linked them, and the \"Archive Round\", featuring pre-1990 news footage in a 'what happened next?' format. Both were dropped as the more popular rounds began to use up more time.\n* Round 2 was originally the \"Tabloid Headlines Round\", in which the panellists identified and commented on the more flippant stories of the week from sufficiently pun-filled [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] headlines.\n** Another of the original rounds later dropped was the similar \"Mini-Headlines Round\", where the panel had to identify a story from the four words used in the original tabloid report as effective chapter headings.\n** In 2004, the headlines were filtered out and replaced with a picture game. An image is slowly revealed to the teams, the object being for one to buzz in before the other and guess how the resulting person or object is relevant to the week's news. Originally this took the form of the \"Picture-Spin Quiz\". Regular variants since have included the \"[[Jigsaw puzzle|Jigsaw]] of News\" and the Christmas-themed \"[[Giblets]] of News\", while others have featured wieldy props for the host, such as the \"[[Wheel of Fortune (UK game show)|Wheel]] of News\", the \"[[Slot machine|One-Armed Bandit]] of News\" and the \"[[High striker|Strengthometer]] of News\". A few versions have been more specific to that week's guest host; e.g. [[Dominic West]], star of American cop drama ''[[The Wire]]'', had the \"[[Police car|Squad Car]] of News\".\n** Occasionally the round is themed around one topic. In these instances, it usually becomes a more straightforward Q&A 'fingers-on-[[buzzer]]s' round.\n** Another slight variation is a spoof of an existing quiz/gameshow, often done when pertinent to the current guests. For example; a mock ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'' game when [[Magnus Magnusson]] appeared or the infamous \"Play Your Iraqi Cards Right\" from [[Bruce Forsyth]]'s first time as host, which took the format of [[Play Your Cards Right|the presenter's former game show]], as well as referencing a [[Most-wanted Iraqi playing cards|special deck of cards]] produced by the Americans for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].\n* Round 3 is the \"Odd One Out Round\", where four personalities, characters and/or objects are presented to a team, whereupon they must identify the interloper, and the topical, amusing or ridiculously obscure link between the other three. In one episode, Merton's \"Odd One Out\" selection consisted of 16 images and in another, the round comprised four photos of [[Michael Howard]]. On another occasion the four choices were Hislop, Merton and both guests, [[Germaine Greer]] and [[Charles Kennedy]]. The four pictures used were the live remote feeds from the studio cameras. (This technique was also used in an episode hosted by [[Ronnie Corbett]], when the comedian featured as one of the choices.) One week, after it had been revealed that a group of celebrities had taken out [[gag order|press injunctions]], the round consisted of four blanked out images, with the host, Rhod Gilbert, explaining that they were unable to reveal who exactly was the odd one out, or the reason.\n** A short-lived variant was another take on the aforementioned \"Connections Round\", with images of three people given, the teams working out what linked them.\n** When Bruce Forsyth was host, this round was replaced by \"Conveyer Belt Connections\", a reference to the final round of ''[[The Generation Game]]''. One of the belts consisted of people and objects whose resulting connection was that they had all been the Odd One Out in previous editions of the show. This included the disparate grouping together of [[sewage|raw sewage]], ''[[The Hay Wain]]'', [[Tinky Winky]] and [[Osama bin Laden]].\n* Round 4 is the \"Missing Words Round\", where newspaper headlines are displayed, with choice words blanked out. The panellists then suggest what these could be. Since 1994, a regular feature of this round is that some of the banners are taken from that week's choice of obscure \"guest publication\". Over the years, these have included ''Goat World'', ''Arthritis News'', ''International Car Park Design'', \"The Caravan Times\" and ''Diarrhoea Digest''. Examples of Missing Words are \"I'll take Edward up the _____\", \"Church may be forced to sell _____\" and \"PM sucked into _____\".\n* After the final scores are read out, there is often an additional Caption Competition, where potentially amusing pictures are shown, to which the panellists are invited to provide an apt headline. No points are awarded for this section.\n\n==Participants==\n\nThe original line-up, from 1990 to 2002, was [[Angus Deayton]] as chairman, with [[Ian Hislop]], the editor of ''[[Private Eye]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/ian-hislop-my-20-years-at-the-eye-421312.html |title=Ian Heslop: My 20 Years at the Eye |newspaper=Independent |date=2007 |accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> and comedian [[Paul Merton]] as team captains. Each captain was accompanied by a guest, usually a [[politician]], [[journalist]] or [[comedian]], or somebody particularly relevant to recent news.\n\nMerton took a break from ''Have I Got News for You'' during the 11th series in 1996, making only one appearance as a guest on Hislop's team.

It is a sequel to 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', the seventh mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the twelfth entry in the franchise overall. The film is written and directed by [[Simon Kinberg]] (in his feature directorial debut) and stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring <!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->[[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Sophie Turner]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], and [[Jessica Chastain]]<!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->. In ''Dark Phoenix'', the X-Men are forced to face the full power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] after a mission in space goes wrong.\n\nAfter ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) erased the events of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) from the [[X-Men (film series)|series']] timeline, Kinberg expressed interest in a new adaptation of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\" in a future film that would be more faithful than his previous attempt with ''The Last Stand'', which was not well received, and even he and writer [[Zak Penn]] were equally unhappy with how it turned out. The new adaptation was confirmed as a follow-up to ''Apocalypse'' in 2016. Kinberg signed on to make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] in June 2017, when the majority of the cast was set to return from ''Apocalypse''. Filming began later that month in [[Montreal]] and was completed in October 2017; the entire third act was later reshot in late 2018, following poor test screenings. The film was dedicated to the memory of ''X-Men'' co-creator [[Stan Lee]], who died in 2018.\n\n''Dark Phoenix'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed $252{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a $200-million budget and became the lowest-grossing installment in the series as well as a [[box office bomb]]. It also received generally unfavorable reviews from critics with various critical takes; many viewed it as a disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to Fox's ''X-Men'' series although the performances of the cast and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score were praised.<ref name=\"Reviews1\" /><ref name=\"Reviews2\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, eight-year-old [[Jean Grey]] and her parents get into a car accident that kills her mother. Shortly afterward, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] takes her to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] because her father was afraid of her.\n\nIn 1992, the [[X-Men]] respond to a distress signal from the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], which is critically damaged by solar flare-like energy during the [[STS-49]] mission. While they save the astronauts, Jean is stranded and struck by the energy which she absorbs into her body to save her team's aircraft from destruction. She survives the event, and her psychic powers are greatly amplified as a result, but they become uncontrollable, and she accidentally unleashes her power on mutants celebrating the victory at Xavier's school. Xavier had placed mental walls in Jean's mind as a girl to protect her psychic mind from experiencing trauma; these are destroyed by Jean's enhanced power, and the trauma slowly returns, resulting in her being full of rage and pain. She travels to her childhood hometown after finding out that her father is still alive and learns that he abandoned her. Jean recovers her complete memory of the car accident and remembers that she had inadvertently caused it rendering her mother unconscious at the wheel with her telepathy, which causes her to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. The X-Men arrive and attempt to take Jean home, but she uses her power against [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], injuring the former and killing the latter, before fleeing.\n\nJean travels to the mutant refugee island of [[Genosha]] to seek assistance from [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] in controlling her rage but is turned away by him after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Jean meets Vuk, the leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]]. She explains to Jean that she has bonded with [[Phoenix Force (comics)|a force of cosmic power]] that wiped out the D'Bari home planet long ago. The power had consumed all those it came across until it was drawn to Jean. Meanwhile, [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], mad with grief by Raven's death, allies with Erik and the mutant refugees in an attempt to kill Jean in [[New York City]].\n\nUpon learning of Erik's plan, the X-Men try to stop him and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|his faction of mutants]]. As they battle, Erik manages to enter the building and confront Jean, only to fall to her amplified powers. Xavier then enters the building with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]]. Jean attacks them until Xavier convinces her to read his memories &ndash; allowing her personality to resurface. Feeling remorseful, Jean offers to let Vuk take the force from her; however, it is revealed that doing so would kill Jean, as well as revealing that Vuk also intends to use the force to conquer Earth. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] are able to prevent Vuk from fully absorbing the force from Jean, though Jean loses consciousness from the ordeal. Troops sent by the U.S. government, who use stun weapons and power-inhibiting collars, attack and subdue both mutant factions, who are placed on a train headed towards a containment facility.\n\nOn the train, Xavier admits to Hank that the latter was right in his earlier accusations of violating Jean's mind. The train is attacked by Vuk and her D'Bari forces. When the soldiers are overpowered by the shape-shifters, the mutants are freed from their restraints to combat the threat. The mutants deal with most of the D'Bari attackers, but Vuk arrives and heads for Jean, defeating each mutant who attempts to stop her. Xavier confers with Jean within his mind, allowing Jean to gain control of her power. After forgiving Xavier, Jean saves the mutants from Vuk's attacks and the ensuing train wreck before proceeding to disintegrate the remaining D'Bari when they attack her. Vuk once again attempts to drain Jean of the force, but Jean takes Vuk into outer space, retakes the power that Vuk had received earlier, and then kills her. Jean then disappears in a burst of energy in the form of a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Xavier's school is renamed the \"Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters\", and Hank becomes their new dean with Xavier having retired. While settling himself in [[Paris]], Xavier is reunited with Erik and agrees to play a game of chess with him. As they start playing, a flaming phoenix appears in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Dark Phoenix cast.jpg|140|1150|The cast of ''Dark Phoenix'' promoting the film at the 2019 [[WonderCon]].

Many of the characters in the film turn against Xavier as some of his decisions regarding Jean Grey's abilities are revealed. Director [[Simon Kinberg]] felt that the character always acts out of concern for the \"greater good,\" though he may make some \"misguided\" choices at times. Kinberg hoped that each character would come across as having \"a valid point of view\" in the film.<ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" />\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: <br />Quicksilver's father and a powerful mutant who can control [[magnetic field]]s and manipulate metal, he is Xavier's former best friend and often rival. Magneto has formed a community of mutant refugees on the island of [[Genosha]],<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> which Kinberg compared to [[Israel]] in it being a homeland where mutants can be safe.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven / Mystique]]: <br />A shape-shifting mutant and Xavier's adopted sister. Lawrence described her role in the film as more maternal than before, as she leads the younger X-Men.<ref name=\"EWLawrence\" /> The film continues growing the schism between Mystique and Xavier, with Mystique not approving of some of Xavier's methods, though Kinberg hoped that this would be more subtle in ''Dark Phoenix'' than in previous ''X-Men'' films. The film also sees the character change between appearing as Raven and Mystique more than previously, with each change having a specific meaning to the character and story.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> She continues to have feelings for Beast.\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy / Beast]]: <br />A mutant with a beastly appearance and superhuman physical abilities. He is a teacher at Xavier's School and helps lead the younger X-Men. He continues to have feelings for Mystique.\n* [[Sophie Turner]] as [[Jean Grey]] / [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]: <br />An extremely powerful mutant with telepathic and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers who is one of Xavier's most prized students. The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix entity]] is unleashed in the film, leading to a fight between the two personalities for control. Turner studied [[dissociative identity disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]] for the role, particularly for scenes where she has to change from the vulnerable Jean to the confident Phoenix.<ref name=\"EWTurner\" /> Kinberg said Turner has the lead role in the film, a first for the actress.<ref name=\"ChastainTHR\" /> Summer Fontana portrays a young Jean Grey.\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers / Cyclops]]: <br />A mutant who fires concussive optic beams. The film develops his relationship with Jean Grey, which Kinberg called \"a huge part of the emotional core of the movie.\" This forces the character to become a leader in the film,<ref name=\"JeanScott\" /> as he is the most prominent character who holds on to hope as Jean grows more unstable.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Alexandra Shipp]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]: <br />An African mutant who can control the weather.\n* [[Evan Peters]] as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff / Quicksilver]]: <br />Magneto's mutant son who can move at [[Speedster (fiction)|superhuman speed]].

Kinberg and Singer both expressed interest in the prospect, and hinted that 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' would set up elements for a retelling. ''Apocalypse'' introduces [[Sophie Turner]] as a young Jean Grey, and begins exploring \"how powerful she is.\"<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" /> By April 2016, the sequel to ''Apocalypse'' was believed to indeed re-adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga.\"<ref name=\"HHApr2016\" /> In May 2016, Kinberg said that the next ''X-Men'' film after ''Apocalypse'' would be set in the 1990s, advancing one decade, as had been done for each of the previous few ''X-Men'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2016\" /> He also noted that ''Apocalypse'' had introduced younger versions of several characters from the original ''X-Men'' films to give them a new [[origin story]]\u2014including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and Jean Grey\u2014with the intention of then exploring them in their own line of films.

The final costumes for the film feature the yellow-and-blue design of the original comics, but combine features of designs from many different incarnations of the group. Kinberg also looked to ''Logan'' for general design inspiration, wanting to replicate the \"naturalistic\" and \"handmade\" quality of that film for the costumes, sets, props, and title design.

It becomes a \"fight for Jean's soul\" and features a twist that was intended to have significant repercussions on the entire franchise.<ref name=\"EWCover\" /> Lawrence revealed that she had worked to convince Kinberg to direct the film, and had promised to return for it if he did so, despite her dislike of the make-up required to portray her character.<ref name=\"EWLawrence2\" /> It was also revealed then that the film would introduce a version of the island [[Genosha]], adapted to the film as a mutant refuge led by Magneto;<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> and that it would focus on the female characters more so than previous films in the series, particularly Jean Grey as both the protagonist and antagonist of the film, and Chastain's character, with whom Grey has a complex relationship.<ref name=\"XWomen\" />\n\nFox delayed the film's release in March 2018, pushing it back from November 2, 2018 to February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This was because Fox and Kinberg wanted to schedule some routine reshoots for the film after receiving feedback from audiences during a test screening, but were not able to get all of the necessary cast members together until August or September 2018. This would not have left enough time to complete post-production work such as visual effects for the additional footage before the November 2018 release date.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> Specifically, Kinberg was looking to rework the third act of the film, and re-wrote part of the script ahead of the reshoots. With post-production already underway, the film was believed to have been under-budget, while the planned reshoots would cost less than $10{{nbsp}}million. Additionally, Kinberg and the studio had been looking to change the film's release date for \"some time\" to avoid competing with the Christmas-oriented film ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. The new February release date was noted as having the film opening away from other major studio films, while placing it on [[President's Day]] weekend, which had proved to be successful for ''Deadpool'' and Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.<ref name=\"THRReshoots\" /> Addressing the reshoots, Kinberg confirmed the scheduling delays, and described the photography as a \"normal\" part of the film's creation that would allow him \"enough time to have it ready and looking perfect.\"<ref name=\"KinbergReshoots\" />\n\nAt the end of April, a Fox panel at the 2018 CinemaCon revealed the first logo for the film. It did not include \"''X-Men''\" in the title, but included a circle around the 'X' in ''Dark Phoenix'' which was compared to the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' logo;<ref name=\"FirstLogo\" /> the film was later confirmed to be simply titled ''Dark Phoenix'' in the United States, and ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' for release internationally.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> By that August, the reshoots were expected to take place in Montreal over two-and-a-half weeks, though the Quebec Film and Television Bureau believed that these reshoots would take up to three months to complete, due to scheduling conflicts among the cast members.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /><ref name=\"ColliderReshootsAug2018\" /> The reshoots were set to take place at MTL Grand\u00e9 studios since MELS Studios was reserved for another production during the reshoot period,<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> and had begun by August 31.<ref name=\"ReshootsBegin\" /> At the end of September, after the release of the film's first trailer, Fox again delayed the film's release, setting it for June 7, 2019. This date was seen as a better time to release the film in China, where the trailer received more attention than in the United States, while also allowing it to take advantage of premium screens that had previously been reserved for Fox's newly-delayed and later canceled ''[[Gambit (unproduced film)|Gambit]]'' film.<ref name=\"Sep2018ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"DisneyMay2019ScheduleUpdate\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/gambit-movie-dead/ |title=\u2018Gambit\u2019 Is Dead; Disney Drops the X-Men Spinoff from the Schedule |website=[[Collider]] |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |date=May 7, 2019 |accessdate=May 7, 2019 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/78CX9lkfJ |archive-date=May 7, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The move was also reportedly to appease [[James Cameron]], who had ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' moved from December to February and did not want competition from another Fox would-be blockbuster; Kinberg and ''Dark Phoenix'' producers opposed the change as the film was not made for a summer and was facing heavy competition.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"We Were Wrong\": Behind Fox's ''Dark Phoenix'' Debacle |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/we-were-wrong-behind-dark-phoenix-foxs-dismal-x-men-franchise-finale-plans-1216859 |access-date=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, [[Lana Condor]] revealed that she was unable to return as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] due to her commitment to the film ''[[To All the Boys I've Loved Before (film)|To All the Boys I've Loved Before]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"CondorCollider\" /> [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]] serves as editor for the film.<ref name=\"EditorSmith\" /> Visual effects were provided by [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]], MELS, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Rodeo FX]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Soho VFX, with Phil Brennan serving as the main visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VisualEffects\" />\n\n==Music==\nEvan Peters stated in January 2018 that [[Hans Zimmer]] was composing the score for the film,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /> despite Zimmer having said in March 2016 that he would not score another superhero film following his experience working on ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"ZimmerNoSupers\" /> Zimmer later explained that in conversations with director [[Ron Howard]] he was convinced to not keep a \"blanket\" view, and to focus on waiting for the right story rather than avoiding an entire genre.

It is a sequel to 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', the seventh mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the twelfth entry in the franchise overall. The film is written and directed by [[Simon Kinberg]] (in his feature directorial debut) and stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring <!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->[[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Sophie Turner]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], and [[Jessica Chastain]]<!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->. In ''Dark Phoenix'', the X-Men are forced to face the full power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] after a mission in space goes wrong.\n\nAfter ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) erased the events of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) from the [[X-Men (film series)|series']] timeline, Kinberg expressed interest in a new adaptation of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\" in a future film that would be more faithful than his previous attempt with ''The Last Stand'', which was not well received, and even he and writer [[Zak Penn]] were equally unhappy with how it turned out. The new adaptation was confirmed as a follow-up to ''Apocalypse'' in 2016. Kinberg signed on to make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] in June 2017, when the majority of the cast was set to return from ''Apocalypse''. Filming began later that month in [[Montreal]] and was completed in October 2017; the entire third act was later reshot in late 2018, following poor test screenings. The film was dedicated to the memory of ''X-Men'' co-creator [[Stan Lee]], who died in 2018.\n\n''Dark Phoenix'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed $252{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a $200-million budget and became the lowest-grossing installment in the series as well as a [[box office bomb]]. It also received generally unfavorable reviews from critics with various critical takes; many viewed it as a disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to Fox's ''X-Men'' series although the performances of the cast and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score were praised.<ref name=\"Reviews1\" /><ref name=\"Reviews2\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, eight-year-old [[Jean Grey]] and her parents get into a car accident that kills her mother. Shortly afterward, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] takes her to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] because her father was afraid of her.\n\nIn 1992, the [[X-Men]] respond to a distress signal from the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], which is critically damaged by solar flare-like energy during the [[STS-49]] mission. While they save the astronauts, Jean is stranded and struck by the energy which she absorbs into her body to save her team's aircraft from destruction. She survives the event, and her psychic powers are greatly amplified as a result, but they become uncontrollable, and she accidentally unleashes her power on mutants celebrating the victory at Xavier's school. Xavier had placed mental walls in Jean's mind as a girl to protect her psychic mind from experiencing trauma; these are destroyed by Jean's enhanced power, and the trauma slowly returns, resulting in her being full of rage and pain. She travels to her childhood hometown after finding out that her father is still alive and learns that he abandoned her. Jean recovers her complete memory of the car accident and remembers that she had inadvertently caused it rendering her mother unconscious at the wheel with her telepathy, which causes her to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. The X-Men arrive and attempt to take Jean home, but she uses her power against [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], injuring the former and killing the latter, before fleeing.\n\nJean travels to the mutant refugee island of [[Genosha]] to seek assistance from [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] in controlling her rage but is turned away by him after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Jean meets Vuk, the leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]]. She explains to Jean that she has bonded with [[Phoenix Force (comics)|a force of cosmic power]] that wiped out the D'Bari home planet long ago. The power had consumed all those it came across until it was drawn to Jean. Meanwhile, [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], mad with grief by Raven's death, allies with Erik and the mutant refugees in an attempt to kill Jean in [[New York City]].\n\nUpon learning of Erik's plan, the X-Men try to stop him and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|his faction of mutants]]. As they battle, Erik manages to enter the building and confront Jean, only to fall to her amplified powers. Xavier then enters the building with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]]. Jean attacks them until Xavier convinces her to read his memories &ndash; allowing her personality to resurface. Feeling remorseful, Jean offers to let Vuk take the force from her; however, it is revealed that doing so would kill Jean, as well as revealing that Vuk also intends to use the force to conquer Earth. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] are able to prevent Vuk from fully absorbing the force from Jean, though Jean loses consciousness from the ordeal. Troops sent by the U.S. government, who use stun weapons and power-inhibiting collars, attack and subdue both mutant factions, who are placed on a train headed towards a containment facility.\n\nOn the train, Xavier admits to Hank that the latter was right in his earlier accusations of violating Jean's mind. The train is attacked by Vuk and her D'Bari forces. When the soldiers are overpowered by the shape-shifters, the mutants are freed from their restraints to combat the threat. The mutants deal with most of the D'Bari attackers, but Vuk arrives and heads for Jean, defeating each mutant who attempts to stop her. Xavier confers with Jean within his mind, allowing Jean to gain control of her power. After forgiving Xavier, Jean saves the mutants from Vuk's attacks and the ensuing train wreck before proceeding to disintegrate the remaining D'Bari when they attack her. Vuk once again attempts to drain Jean of the force, but Jean takes Vuk into outer space, retakes the power that Vuk had received earlier, and then kills her. Jean then disappears in a burst of energy in the form of a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Xavier's school is renamed the \"Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters\", and Hank becomes their new dean with Xavier having retired. While settling himself in [[Paris]], Xavier is reunited with Erik and agrees to play a game of chess with him. As they start playing, a flaming phoenix appears in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Dark Phoenix cast.jpg|140|1150|The cast of ''Dark Phoenix'' promoting the film at the 2019 [[WonderCon]].

Many of the characters in the film turn against Xavier as some of his decisions regarding Jean Grey's abilities are revealed. Director [[Simon Kinberg]] felt that the character always acts out of concern for the \"greater good,\" though he may make some \"misguided\" choices at times. Kinberg hoped that each character would come across as having \"a valid point of view\" in the film.<ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" />\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: <br />Quicksilver's father and a powerful mutant who can control [[magnetic field]]s and manipulate metal, he is Xavier's former best friend and often rival.

Lawrence described her role in the film as more maternal than before, as she leads the younger X-Men.<ref name=\"EWLawrence\" /> The film continues growing the schism between Mystique and Xavier, with Mystique not approving of some of Xavier's methods, though Kinberg hoped that this would be more subtle in ''Dark Phoenix'' than in previous ''X-Men'' films. The film also sees the character change between appearing as Raven and Mystique more than previously, with each change having a specific meaning to the character and story.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> She continues to have feelings for Beast.\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy / Beast]]: <br />A mutant with a beastly appearance and superhuman physical abilities. He is a teacher at Xavier's School and helps lead the younger X-Men. He continues to have feelings for Mystique.\n* [[Sophie Turner]] as [[Jean Grey]] / [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]: <br />An extremely powerful mutant with telepathic and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers who is one of Xavier's most prized students. The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix entity]] is unleashed in the film, leading to a fight between the two personalities for control. Turner studied [[dissociative identity disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]] for the role, particularly for scenes where she has to change from the vulnerable Jean to the confident Phoenix.<ref name=\"EWTurner\" /> Kinberg said Turner has the lead role in the film, a first for the actress.<ref name=\"ChastainTHR\" /> Summer Fontana portrays a young Jean Grey.\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers / Cyclops]]: <br />A mutant who fires concussive optic beams. The film develops his relationship with Jean Grey, which Kinberg called \"a huge part of the emotional core of the movie.\" This forces the character to become a leader in the film,<ref name=\"JeanScott\" /> as he is the most prominent character who holds on to hope as Jean grows more unstable.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Alexandra Shipp]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]: <br />An African mutant who can control the weather.\n* [[Evan Peters]] as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff / Quicksilver]]: <br />Magneto's mutant son who can move at [[Speedster (fiction)|superhuman speed]].

The studio chose to adapt the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" as only one of the film's \"parallel storylines\", with an executive at [[20th Century Fox]] suggesting that the \"[[Gifted (comics)|Gifted]]\" storyline also be in that film.<ref name=\"KinbergX3\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicmix.com/news/2008/04/15/interview-zak-penn-on-the-grand-x-men-fans-and-co-writing-hulk/ |title=INTERVIEW: ZAK PENN ON THE GRAND, X-MEN FANS AND CO-WRITING HULK |access-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> This version of the story was not well received by fans and critics. Kinberg stated that he and Penn were ultimately unhappy with how the adaptation turned out as well.<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" />\n\nAfter the timeline of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' franchise]] was [[retconned]] with the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', it was noted that a new adaptation of the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" could be made that ignores the events of ''The Last Stand''. Kinberg and Singer both expressed interest in the prospect, and hinted that 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' would set up elements for a retelling. ''Apocalypse'' introduces [[Sophie Turner]] as a young Jean Grey, and begins exploring \"how powerful she is.\"<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" /> By April 2016, the sequel to ''Apocalypse'' was believed to indeed re-adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga.\"<ref name=\"HHApr2016\" /> In May 2016, Kinberg said that the next ''X-Men'' film after ''Apocalypse'' would be set in the 1990s, advancing one decade, as had been done for each of the previous few ''X-Men'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2016\" /> He also noted that ''Apocalypse'' had introduced younger versions of several characters from the original ''X-Men'' films to give them a new [[origin story]]\u2014including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and Jean Grey\u2014with the intention of then exploring them in their own line of films. He added that he also hoped to see the cast of the previous trilogy of films return, namely [[James McAvoy]] as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], [[Michael Fassbender]] as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, and [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkh\u00f6lme / Mystique]].<ref name=\"CastHopes\" />\n\nIn July, Kinberg said he would begin writing the next mainline ''X-Men'' film \"real soon\".<ref name=\"KinbergJul2016\" /> That November, Fox was said to be pressing \"the reset button\" on the franchise due to the financial and critical under-performance of ''Apocalypse'', with the franchise being reconfigured and Singer not returning to direct the next film. McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, and [[Nicholas Hoult]]'s contracts from the previous trilogy had ended, but Kinberg was optimistically writing the new script with them in mind.<ref name=\"UniversePlans\" /> It was rumored in February 2017 that the next film would be titled ''X-Men: Supernova'', and would begin filming that June.<ref name=\"Supernova\" /> Also in February, Turner confirmed that she would return for the film.<ref name=\"TurnerFeb2017\" /> Kinberg was believed to be interested in making his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with the film,<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb2017\" /> and was described as the top contender for the job with interest from Fox. The studio was also looking to negotiate new deals with Lawrence, Fassbender, McAvoy, and Hoult to return.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20172\" /> By the end of the month, Kinberg described reports that he may direct the film as \"premature,\" but added that if he were to direct, he would not be daunted by the scale of the film due to his experience writing and producing many of the other ''X-Men'' films. He also reiterated that he would adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\" differently to how it was for ''The Last Stand'' if given another opportunity to do so.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20173\" />\n\n===Writing and original two-part plan===\n\nSimon Kinberg wanted a two-film story,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/olivia-munn-interview-lego-ninjago-movie-x-men-dark-phoenix/|title=Olivia Munn on 'The LEGO Ninjago Movie' & Returning for 'X-Men: Dark Phoenix'|first=Christina|last=Radish|date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> but in late pre-production, the studio canceled the second film, and Kinberg had to make major changes to the first film\u2019s script.<ref name=\"deadline-bomb\">{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/06/dark-phoenix-bombs-at-the-box-office-reasons-why-1202629749/|title=\u2018Dark Phoenix\u2019 Bound To Lose $100M+ After Worst Domestic Opening In \u2018X-Men\u2019 Series: Here\u2019s Why|first1=Anthony|last1=D'Alessandro|first2=Anthony|last2=D'Alessandro|date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> Chris Claremont also confirmed the two-film plan and revealed that they would have been titled ''Phoenix'' and ''Dark Phoenix''.

Kinberg also looked to ''Logan'' for general design inspiration, wanting to replicate the \"naturalistic\" and \"handmade\" quality of that film for the costumes, sets, props, and title design.

It becomes a \"fight for Jean's soul\" and features a twist that was intended to have significant repercussions on the entire franchise.<ref name=\"EWCover\" /> Lawrence revealed that she had worked to convince Kinberg to direct the film, and had promised to return for it if he did so, despite her dislike of the make-up required to portray her character.<ref name=\"EWLawrence2\" /> It was also revealed then that the film would introduce a version of the island [[Genosha]], adapted to the film as a mutant refuge led by Magneto;<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> and that it would focus on the female characters more so than previous films in the series, particularly Jean Grey as both the protagonist and antagonist of the film, and Chastain's character, with whom Grey has a complex relationship.<ref name=\"XWomen\" />\n\nFox delayed the film's release in March 2018, pushing it back from November 2, 2018 to February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This was because Fox and Kinberg wanted to schedule some routine reshoots for the film after receiving feedback from audiences during a test screening, but were not able to get all of the necessary cast members together until August or September 2018. This would not have left enough time to complete post-production work such as visual effects for the additional footage before the November 2018 release date.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> Specifically, Kinberg was looking to rework the third act of the film, and re-wrote part of the script ahead of the reshoots. With post-production already underway, the film was believed to have been under-budget, while the planned reshoots would cost less than $10{{nbsp}}million. Additionally, Kinberg and the studio had been looking to change the film's release date for \"some time\" to avoid competing with the Christmas-oriented film ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. The new February release date was noted as having the film opening away from other major studio films, while placing it on [[President's Day]] weekend, which had proved to be successful for ''Deadpool'' and Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.<ref name=\"THRReshoots\" /> Addressing the reshoots, Kinberg confirmed the scheduling delays, and described the photography as a \"normal\" part of the film's creation that would allow him \"enough time to have it ready and looking perfect.\"<ref name=\"KinbergReshoots\" />\n\nAt the end of April, a Fox panel at the 2018 CinemaCon revealed the first logo for the film. It did not include \"''X-Men''\" in the title, but included a circle around the 'X' in ''Dark Phoenix'' which was compared to the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' logo;<ref name=\"FirstLogo\" /> the film was later confirmed to be simply titled ''Dark Phoenix'' in the United States, and ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' for release internationally.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> By that August, the reshoots were expected to take place in Montreal over two-and-a-half weeks, though the Quebec Film and Television Bureau believed that these reshoots would take up to three months to complete, due to scheduling conflicts among the cast members.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /><ref name=\"ColliderReshootsAug2018\" /> The reshoots were set to take place at MTL Grand\u00e9 studios since MELS Studios was reserved for another production during the reshoot period,<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> and had begun by August 31.<ref name=\"ReshootsBegin\" /> At the end of September, after the release of the film's first trailer, Fox again delayed the film's release, setting it for June 7, 2019. This date was seen as a better time to release the film in China, where the trailer received more attention than in the United States, while also allowing it to take advantage of premium screens that had previously been reserved for Fox's newly-delayed and later canceled ''[[Gambit (unproduced film)|Gambit]]'' film.<ref name=\"Sep2018ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"DisneyMay2019ScheduleUpdate\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/gambit-movie-dead/ |title=\u2018Gambit\u2019 Is Dead; Disney Drops the X-Men Spinoff from the Schedule |website=[[Collider]] |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |date=May 7, 2019 |accessdate=May 7, 2019 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/78CX9lkfJ |archive-date=May 7, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The move was also reportedly to appease [[James Cameron]], who had ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' moved from December to February and did not want competition from another Fox would-be blockbuster; Kinberg and ''Dark Phoenix'' producers opposed the change as the film was not made for a summer and was facing heavy competition.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"We Were Wrong\": Behind Fox's ''Dark Phoenix'' Debacle |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/we-were-wrong-behind-dark-phoenix-foxs-dismal-x-men-franchise-finale-plans-1216859 |access-date=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, [[Lana Condor]] revealed that she was unable to return as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] due to her commitment to the film ''[[To All the Boys I've Loved Before (film)|To All the Boys I've Loved Before]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"CondorCollider\" /> [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]] serves as editor for the film.<ref name=\"EditorSmith\" /> Visual effects were provided by [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]], MELS, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Rodeo FX]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Soho VFX, with Phil Brennan serving as the main visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VisualEffects\" />\n\n==Music==\nEvan Peters stated in January 2018 that [[Hans Zimmer]] was composing the score for the film,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /> despite Zimmer having said in March 2016 that he would not score another superhero film following his experience working on ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"ZimmerNoSupers\" /> Zimmer later explained that in conversations with director [[Ron Howard]] he was convinced to not keep a \"blanket\" view, and to focus on waiting for the right story rather than avoiding an entire genre.
