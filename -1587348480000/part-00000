His service was not continuous, as he was not an MP for a spell in 1908 and between 1922 and 1924.\n\n[[Charles Pelham Villiers]] was the longest continuously serving MP. He was elected in 1835 and remained an MP continuously for over 62 years until his death on 16 January 1898, aged 96 years 13 days. Since the start of the 20th century, the longest continuous service by an MP has been 51 years 80 days by [[Edward Heath]], who sat from 1950 to 2001.\n\nThe longest continuous service record for a female MP is held by [[Harriet Harman]], first elected in October 1982. The longest total service record for a female MP is  held by [[Margaret Beckett|Dame Margaret Beckett]], who served for 4 years and 7 months between 1974 and 1979 and was then re-elected in June 1983. Beckett also holds the record for the longest span of service for a woman.\n\n===Shortest===\nThere are cases of MPs being elected posthumously; [[Edward Legge (Royal Navy officer)|Edward Legge]] (1710\u201347) was elected unopposed as [[Portsmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for Portsmouth]] on 15 December 1747, four days before news arrived that he had died 87 days previously in the [[West Indies]]. In 1780 [[John Kirkman]] was elected as [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for the City of London]] despite passing away before polls closed.<ref name=\"GBOR96\"/>\n\nIn more recent times, members have died after polling, but before the declaration of the results. In [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]], [[Thomas Higgins (Irish politician)|Thomas Higgins]] was declared elected for the seat of [[North Galway (UK Parliament constituency)|North Galway]], even though he had died earlier that morning, after polling day. More recently, in 1945 Sir [[Edward Taswell Campbell]] at [[Bromley (UK Parliament constituency)|Bromley]] and [[Leslie Pym]] at [[Monmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth]] died after polling, but nine days before the declaration of the results. Both were declared elected posthumously, and both had been MPs for a number of years. [[Noel Skelton]] is another example in 1935.\n\nThe shortest non-posthumous service was that of [[Alfred Dobbs]], who was declared elected [[Smethwick (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for Smethwick]] on 26 July 1945 and was killed the following day in a car accident on the way to take his seat.<ref>{{cite book |last=Buchanan |first=Tom |date=1991 |title=The Spanish Civil War and the British Labour Movement |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=98 |isbn=0521393337}}</ref>\n\nThe shortest service for women MPs has been 97 days in the case of [[Jane Dodds]], who was MP for [[Brecon and Radnorshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]] from a [[2019 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election|by-election on 1 August 2019]] to dissolution of Parliament on 6 November 2019 prior to [[2019 United Kingdom general election|the following month's general election]].

In the UK Parliament, [[William Vesey-FitzGerald, 2nd Baron FitzGerald and Vesey|William Vesey-FitzGerald]], [[Lord Charles Beresford]] and [[Arthur Henderson]] were exceptional in achieving it on no fewer than four occasions each: Vesey-FitzGerald over a span of 18 years through three [[by-election]]s and one general election, Beresford over a span of 25 years after voluntarily resigning or retiring from the House at stages of his naval career, Henderson invariably at by-elections following serial general election defeats in previous seats, in the shorter span of 14 years.

as:\n:-years when no parliaments were held, such as [[Charles I of England|Charles I's]] [[Personal Rule|rule without parliament]] covering 1630\u201339,\n:-Royalist MPs expelled during the English Civil Wars sitting again after the restoration of Charles II (1660),\n:-the Cavalier Parliament of 1661\u201379 which met without general elections in meantime.\n:-former Civil War and Commonwealth

century and the creation of the United Kingdom Parliament in 1801, possibly the longest gap between sitting was faced by [[Henry Drummond (1786\u20131860)]], of nearly 35 years between the dissolution

Another 59 year service span was enjoyed by two brothers, [[William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale]] (when Viscount Lowther before entering the House of Lords in 1841) and [[Henry Cecil Lowther]], from the former's election as MP for [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth]] in 1808 until the death of the latter as MP for [[Westmorland (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland]] (which he had represented since 1812) and [[Father of the House]] on 4 December 1867.\n\n[[Thomas Hyde Villiers]] and his brother [[Charles Pelham Villiers]] (above) had a span of nearly 72 years service from the former's first election as MP in 1826 to the latter's death as a serving MP and Father of the House in 1898, but this was broken by an interval when the former was out of parliament in 1831, and the gap between Thomas' death on 3 December 1832 and Charles' first election in [[1835 United Kingdom general election|1835]]. Their consecutive service thus totalled 69 years.\n\n===Representation of same constituency by brothers===\nWhere seats were in the patronage of territorial magnates, it was commonplace into the 19th century for brothers in (usually landowning) families to hold seats successively or (before the advent of single member seats) even concurrently, before the system of choosing candidates by local party associations became organised on a competitive selection basis.\nTwo brothers successively represented [[North Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Derbyshire]] for a total span of nearly 48 years. [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|Lord Cavendish of Keighley]] was MP from the [[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832 general election]] until succeeding his father and going to the House of Lords as Earl of Burlington in 1834. He was succeeded by [[Lord George Henry Cavendish]] from 1834 until the latter's death on 23 September 1880.\n\nThe last set of brothers to represent the same constituency were [[Frederick Guest|Frederick]] and [[Henry Guest]], who did so in connection with two successive constituencies:\n* [[East Dorset (UK Parliament constituency)|East Dorset]]. Frederick was first elected at the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910 general election]] but was unable to take his seat due to irregularity by an election agent, causing a [[1910 East Dorset by-election|by-election]] in June 1910 when he stepped aside in favour of Henry, who held the seat until the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910 general election]] when Henry in turn stepped aside in favour of Frederick who was elected, to hold the seat until the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]]. \n* [[Plymouth Drake (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Drake]], of which Frederick was MP from 1931 to his death in 1937 when Henry succeeded him at the by-election and held the seat until the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]].\n\n===Brother sets serving after the 2019 general election===\nSets with one brother still serving:\n:[[Boris Johnson]], MP for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] 2001\u201308 and [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] from [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], and [[Jo Johnson]], MP for [[Orpington (UK Parliament constituency)|Orpington]] 2010\u201319.\n:[[David Miliband]], MP for [[South Shields (UK Parliament constituency)|South Shields]] 2001\u201313, and [[Ed Miliband]], MP for [[Doncaster North (UK Parliament constituency)|Doncaster North]] from 2005.\n\n==Brother-sister sets of MPs==\n\n* [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym Lloyd George (later 1st Viscount Tenby)]], MP for [[Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Pembrokeshire]] 1922\u201324 and 1929\u201350 and [[Newcastle upon Tyne North (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle upon Tyne North]] 1951\u201357, and sister [[Megan Lloyd George|Lady Megan Lloyd George]], MP for [[Anglesey (UK Parliament constituency)|Anglesey]] 1929\u201351 and [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]] 1957\u201366.\n* [[Victor Cazalet]], MP for [[Chippenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chippenham]] 1924\u201343 and his sister [[Thelma Cazalet-Keir]], MP for [[Islington East (UK Parliament constituency)|Islington East]] 1931\u201345.\n\n===Brother-sister set serving after the 2019 general election===\n* Set with one sibling still serving \u2013 [[Keith Vaz]], MP for [[Leicester East (UK Parliament constituency)|Leicester East]] 1987\u20132019, and sister [[Valerie Vaz]], MP for [[Walsall South (UK Parliament constituency)|Walsall South]] from 2010.\n\n==Twins==\n[[James Grenville, 1st Baron Glastonbury|James Grenville]] and [[Richard Grenville (1742\u20131823)|Richard Grenville]] sat together as MPs for [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] from 1774 to 1780.\n\n[[Edward Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley|Edward John Stanley]], MP for [[North Cheshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Cheshire]], sat alongside his brother [[William Owen Stanley]], MP for [[Anglesey (UK Parliament constituency)|Anglesey]], from 1837 to 1841.\n\n[[Angela Eagle]] and [[Maria Eagle]], mentioned [[#Sister sets|above]], are the only twin sisters to have sat in the Commons together, last elected in 2019.\n\n==Ethnic minorities==\n{{main|List of ethnic minority politicians in the United Kingdom}}\n\n==LGBT members==\n{{main|List of the first LGBT holders of political offices in the United Kingdom}}\n\n==First general election victors by religious affiliation==\nWhen the UK Parliament was established in 1801, non-[[Anglican]]s were prevented from taking their seats as MPs under the [[Test Act 1672]]. However, [[Methodist]]s took communion at Anglican churches until 1795, and some continued to do so, and many [[Presbyterian]]s were prepared to accept Anglican communion, thus ensuring that members of these creeds were represented in the Parliament.<ref>Chris Pond, [http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-01493.pdf Parliament and Religious Disabilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928094928/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-01493.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}</ref>  Some [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] were also elected.\n\nThe first [[Roman Catholic]] general election victors in the UK Parliament were at the [[1830 United Kingdom general election|1830 general election]].

All began serving in the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 126 years.\n* [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Henry Paget, Lord Paget (later 1st Marquess of Anglesey)]] served 1790\u20131804 and 1806\u201310; [[Arthur Paget (diplomat)|Arthur Paget]] 1794\u20131807; [[Berkeley Paget]] 1807\u201326; [[Charles Paget (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Charles Paget]] 1804\u201326 and 1831\u201333 and 1833\u201334; [[Edward Paget|Sir Edward Paget]], 1796\u20131806 and 1810\u201320; and [[William Paget (MP)|William Paget]] 1790 to his death in 1794. Four of the brothers began serving under the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 79 years.\n\n===Longest span of service in the Commons by brothers===\nProbably the longest (though not continuous) all time span of service by brothers in the Commons, in the Parliament of England, was 85 years from 1562, when [[Henry Knollys (privateer)|Sir Henry Knollys]] was elected MP for [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]], until the death in 1648 of his brother [[Francis Knollys (admiral)|Sir Francis Knollys]] (above, aged reputedly 97) also representing Reading, although there were intervals of years when parliament did not meet. They were part of another set of six brothers who all sat at various times.\n\nSince regular parliamentary government was established by the start of the UK Parliament, contenders for longest span of continuous service include the four brothers [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] (also twice Prime Minister), [[William Yates Peel]], [[Jonathan Peel]] and [[Edmund Peel]], with a span of 59 years from Robert's by-election return on 15 April 1809 as MP for [[Cashel (UK Parliament constituency)|Cashel]], to the retirement of Jonathan at the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. Their collective service totalled 115 years and all four were simultaneously in Parliament when Edmund was sitting in 1831\u201332 and 1835\u201337 for [[Newcastle-under-Lyme (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle-under-Lyme]]. Another 59 year service span was enjoyed by two brothers, [[William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale]] (when Viscount Lowther before entering the House of Lords in 1841) and [[Henry Cecil Lowther]], from the former's election as MP for [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth]] in 1808 until the death of the latter as MP for [[Westmorland (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland]] (which he had represented since 1812) and [[Father of the House]] on 4 December 1867.\n\n[[Thomas Hyde Villiers]] and his brother [[Charles Pelham Villiers]] (above) had a span of nearly 72 years service from the former's first election as MP in 1826 to the latter's death as a serving MP and Father of the House in 1898, but this was broken by an interval when the former was out of parliament in 1831, and the gap between Thomas' death on 3 December 1832 and Charles' first election in [[1835 United Kingdom general election|1835]]. Their consecutive service thus totalled 69 years.\n\n===Representation of same constituency by brothers===\nWhere seats were in the patronage of territorial magnates, it was commonplace into the 19th century for brothers in (usually landowning) families to hold seats successively or (before the advent of single member seats) even concurrently, before the system of choosing candidates by local party associations became organised on a competitive selection basis.\nTwo brothers successively represented [[North Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Derbyshire]] for a total span of nearly 48 years.

The veterans protested the \"poor treatment in America's Veterans Hospitals\" and demanded better treatment for returning veterans, a full investigation of all [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) facilities, and a face-to-face meeting with head of the VA, [[Donald E. Johnson]]. The strike continued to escalate until Johnson finally agreed to fly out from Washington, D.C., and meet with the veterans. The hunger strike ended soon after that. Several months later Johnson resigned. In late August 1974, Kovic traveled to Belfast, Northern Ireland, where he spent a week in the Catholic stronghold of \"Turf Lodge,\" interviewing both political activists and residents. In the spring of 1975 Kovic, author Richard Boyle, and photo journalist Loretta Smith traveled to cover the war in Cambodia for Pacific News Service.<ref name=gay/>\n\nKovic was a speaker at the [[1976 Democratic National Convention]], seconding the nomination of draft resister [[Fritz Efaw]] for Vice President of the United States. ''Time'' magazine described the scene as one of the few poignant moments of the convention and many in the audience were brought to tears. On July 12, 1977, Kovic was arrested with 191 students and supporters during the [[Tent_city#Kent_State_University|anti-Gymnasium protests]] at Kent State University. In 1979, Ron Kovic gave a speech at The Libertarian National Convention which nominated Ed Clark for President. In 1988, Kovic was a Jesse Jackson delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1983, he published Around the World in Eight Days, a short novel about a Vietnam War veteran who wagers that he can circle the globe in eight days without the benefit of aircraft. Writing in American Book Review, Edmund Cardoni called the book \"wildly imaginative\" and noted that compared to Born on the Fourth of July, Around the World in Eight Days is \"more patently literary in the tribute it pays to the transformative power of narrative art.\"\n\nFrom 1990 to 1991, Kovic took part in several [[anti-war]] demonstrations against the first [[Gulf War]], which occurred not long after the release of his biographical film in 1989.<ref name=gay/> In early May 1999, following the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Kovic met with China's ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing at the Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. to express his most sincere condolences and present the ambassador and his staff with two dozen red roses. He was an outspoken critic of the [[Iraq War]].<ref name=gay/>\n\n===Since 2000===\nIn November 2003, Kovic joined protests in London against the visit of [[George W. Bush]]. He was the guest of honor at a reception held at London's city hall by Mayor [[Ken Livingstone]]. The following day, he led a march of several hundred thousand demonstrators on [[Trafalgar Square]], where a huge rally was held protesting the visit of George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. Kovic attended the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver]], Colorado. On Sunday, August 24, 2008, the day before the convention began, Kovic spoke, then led thousands in a march against the war which ended with him saying, \"In the city of Denver, we got welcomed home.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/politics/ci_10320524|title=Denverpost.com}}</ref>\n\nIn a new introduction to his book, ''[[Born on the Fourth of July]]'' (1976), written in March 2005, Kovic stated, \"I wanted people to understand. I wanted to share with them as nakedly and openly and intimately as possible what I had gone through, what I had endured. I wanted them to know what it really meant to be in a war, to be shot and wounded, to be fighting for my life on the intensive care ward, not the myth we had grown up believing. I wanted people to know about the hospitals and the enema room, about why I had become opposed to the war, why I had grown more and more committed to peace and nonviolence. I had been beaten by the police and arrested twelve times for protesting the war and I had spent many nights in jail in my wheelchair. I had been called a [[anticommunism|Communist]] and a traitor, simply for trying to tell the truth about what had happened in that war, but I refused to be intimidated.\" In 1989, Kovic presented actor [[Tom Cruise]] (born July 3, 1962) who portrayed him in the movie ''Born On The Fourth of July,'' on the last day of filming, the original Bronze Star Medal he had received,<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/17/movies/the-private-war-of-tom-cruise.html|title=The Private War of Tom Cruise|first=PAUL CHUTKOW; Paul Chutkow is a California-based|last=freelance|date=December 17, 1989|publisher=|accessdate=December 20, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> explaining to Cruise that he was giving him the medal as a gift <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0468407/bio|title=Ron Kovic|website=IMDb|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref> \"for his heroic performance.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that [[Oliver Stone]] said, \"He gave it to Tom for bravery for having gone through this experience in hell as much as any person can without actually having been there.\"\n\nIn March 2007, Kovic checked into the [[Ernest Bors]] Spinal Cord Injury ward of the Veterans Administration Hospital in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], California, for an undisclosed illness.\n\nOn January 20, 2008, Kovic observed his 40th anniversary of having been shot and paralyzed in the Vietnam War. Kovic, in March 2005, said: \"The scar will always be there, a living reminder of that war, but it has also become something beautiful now, something of faith and hope and love. I have been given the opportunity to move through that dark night of the soul to a new shore, to gain an understanding, a knowledge, and entirely different vision. I now believe I have suffered for a reason and in many ways I have found that reason in my commitment to peace and nonviolence. My life has been a blessing in disguise, even with the pain and great difficulty that my physical disability continues to bring. It is a blessing to speak on behalf of peace, to be able to reach such a great number of people.\"\n\nOn April 8, 2009, Kovic joined British MP [[George Galloway]] to launch Viva Palestina USA, an American branch of [[Viva Palestina]]. Kovic planned to co-lead with Galloway a humanitarian relief convoy to the Gaza Strip in early July 2009. On December 6, 2009 Kovic spoke honoring [[Bruce Springsteen]] at the 32nd annual [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in Washington, D.C. On December 22, 2009, Kovic, [[Oliver Stone]], and friends celebrated the 20th anniversary of the 1989 film release of ''Born on the Fourth of July'' at a dinner party in Torrance, California. In April 2010, Kovic traveled to Rome, Italy, as a member of the Council for Dignity, Forgiveness, and Reconciliation. Between April 19\u201326, he attended meetings at Rome's City Hall with other international peace activists, diplomats and academics, to discuss the need for conflict resolution and other more peaceful, nonviolent alternatives to war as a way of solving the world's many conflicts. On April 21, 2010, he spoke of his journey from war to peace, forgiveness, and reconciliation before Rome's mayor, [[Gianni Alemanno]], and other civic leaders at Rome's [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Augustan Peace), commissioned by the Roman Senate on July 4, 13 BC.\n\nOn July 4, 2016 [[Akashic Books]] published the 40th anniversary edition of ''Born on the Fourth of July'', with a foreword by [[Bruce Springsteen]], in conjunction with Kovic's latest book, ''Hurricane Street''. Naming it a Top 10 Pick for Spring 2016, [[Publishers Weekly]] reported, \"The author of the bestseller ''Born on the Fourth of July'' writes an impassioned and timely memoir about the 1974 American Veterans Movement that will strike a chord with veterans and their families today.\" Despite its creator's fatalism, \"Born On the Fourth of July\" has left ripples. Stone expressed great admiration for Kovic, praising him for affecting change in America's VA hospitals, and actively protesting both Gulf Wars. \"He's one of the strongest men I've ever met in my life,\" Stone said. \"I don't know how he's able to go through what he does every day.\" Born on the Fourth of July received a National Book Award nomination.\n\nKovic lives in [[Redondo Beach, California]], where he writes, paints, plays the piano, and gardens.

Writing in American Book Review, Edmund Cardoni called the book \"wildly imaginative\" and noted that compared to Born on the Fourth of July, Around the World in Eight Days is \"more patently literary in the tribute it pays to the transformative power of narrative art.\"\n\nFrom 1990 to 1991, Kovic took part in several [[anti-war]] demonstrations against the first [[Gulf War]], which occurred not long after the release of his biographical film in 1989.<ref name=gay/> In early May 1999, following the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Kovic met with China's ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing at the Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. to express his most sincere condolences and present the ambassador and his staff with two dozen red roses. He was an outspoken critic of the [[Iraq War]].<ref name=gay/>\n\n===Since 2000===\nIn November 2003, Kovic joined protests in London against the visit of [[George W. Bush]]. He was the guest of honor at a reception held at London's city hall by Mayor [[Ken Livingstone]]. The following day, he led a march of several hundred thousand demonstrators on [[Trafalgar Square]], where a huge rally was held protesting the visit of George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. Kovic attended the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver]], Colorado. On Sunday, August 24, 2008, the day before the convention began, Kovic spoke, then led thousands in a march against the war which ended with him saying, \"In the city of Denver, we got welcomed home.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/politics/ci_10320524|title=Denverpost.com}}</ref>\n\nIn a new introduction to his book, ''[[Born on the Fourth of July]]'' (1976), written in March 2005, Kovic stated, \"I wanted people to understand. I wanted to share with them as nakedly and openly and intimately as possible what I had gone through, what I had endured. I wanted them to know what it really meant to be in a war, to be shot and wounded, to be fighting for my life on the intensive care ward, not the myth we had grown up believing. I wanted people to know about the hospitals and the enema room, about why I had become opposed to the war, why I had grown more and more committed to peace and nonviolence. I had been beaten by the police and arrested twelve times for protesting the war and I had spent many nights in jail in my wheelchair. I had been called a [[anticommunism|Communist]] and a traitor, simply for trying to tell the truth about what had happened in that war, but I refused to be intimidated.\" In 1989, Kovic presented actor [[Tom Cruise]] (born July 3, 1962) who portrayed him in the movie ''Born On The Fourth of July,'' on the last day of filming, the original Bronze Star Medal he had received,<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/17/movies/the-private-war-of-tom-cruise.html|title=The Private War of Tom Cruise|first=PAUL CHUTKOW; Paul Chutkow is a California-based|last=freelance|date=December 17, 1989|publisher=|accessdate=December 20, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> explaining to Cruise that he was giving him the medal as a gift <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0468407/bio|title=Ron Kovic|website=IMDb|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref> \"for his heroic performance.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that [[Oliver Stone]] said, \"He gave it to Tom for bravery for having gone through this experience in hell as much as any person can without actually having been there.\"\n\nIn March 2007, Kovic checked into the [[Ernest Bors]] Spinal Cord Injury ward of the Veterans Administration Hospital in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], California, for an undisclosed illness.\n\nOn January 20, 2008, Kovic observed his 40th anniversary of having been shot and paralyzed in the Vietnam War. Kovic, in March 2005, said: \"The scar will always be there, a living reminder of that war, but it has also become something beautiful now, something of faith and hope and love. I have been given the opportunity to move through that dark night of the soul to a new shore, to gain an understanding, a knowledge, and entirely different vision. I now believe I have suffered for a reason and in many ways I have found that reason in my commitment to peace and nonviolence. My life has been a blessing in disguise, even with the pain and great difficulty that my physical disability continues to bring. It is a blessing to speak on behalf of peace, to be able to reach such a great number of people.\"\n\nOn April 8, 2009, Kovic joined British MP [[George Galloway]] to launch Viva Palestina USA, an American branch of [[Viva Palestina]]. Kovic planned to co-lead with Galloway a humanitarian relief convoy to the Gaza Strip in early July 2009. On December 6, 2009 Kovic spoke honoring [[Bruce Springsteen]] at the 32nd annual [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in Washington, D.C. On December 22, 2009, Kovic, [[Oliver Stone]], and friends celebrated the 20th anniversary of the 1989 film release of ''Born on the Fourth of July'' at a dinner party in Torrance, California. In April 2010, Kovic traveled to Rome, Italy, as a member of the Council for Dignity, Forgiveness, and Reconciliation. Between April 19\u201326, he attended meetings at Rome's City Hall with other international peace activists, diplomats and academics, to discuss the need for conflict resolution and other more peaceful, nonviolent alternatives to war as a way of solving the world's many conflicts. On April 21, 2010, he spoke of his journey from war to peace, forgiveness, and reconciliation before Rome's mayor, [[Gianni Alemanno]], and other civic leaders at Rome's [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Augustan Peace), commissioned by the Roman Senate on July 4, 13 BC.\n\nOn July 4, 2016 Akashic Books published the 40th anniversary edition of ''Born on the Fourth of July'', with a foreword by Bruce Springsteen, in conjunction with Kovic's latest book, ''Hurricane Street''. Naming it a Top 10 Pick for Spring 2016, [[Publishers Weekly]] reported, \"The author of the bestseller ''Born on the Fourth of July'' writes an impassioned and timely memoir about the 1974 American Veterans Movement that will strike a chord with veterans and their families today.\" Despite its creator's fatalism, \"Born On the Fourth of July\" has left ripples. Stone expressed great admiration for Kovic, praising him for affecting change in America's VA hospitals, and actively protesting both Gulf Wars. \"He's one of the strongest men I've ever met in my life,\" Stone said. \"I don't know how he's able to go through what he does every day.\" Born on the Fourth of July received a National Book Award nomination.\n\nKovic lives in [[Redondo Beach, California]], where he writes, paints, plays the piano, and gardens. He has never married, although he did have a relationship with Connie Panzarino (author of ''The Me in the Mirror'').<ref name=\"People Magazine\">{{cite book|last=People|first=Magazine|title=Ron Kovic: A Crippled Vet Born on the Fourth of July Is a New Breed of Yankee Doodle Dandy|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20067273,00.html}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Bruce Springsteen]] wrote the song \"[[Shut Out the Light]]\" after reading Kovic's memoir and then meeting him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bookmark/bruce-springsteen-gives-born-fourth-907432 |title= Bruce Springsteen Gives 'Born on the Fourth of July' New Foreword (Audio)|last1= Lewis|first1= Andy|date= July 1, 2016|website= www.HollywoodReporter.com|publisher= The Hollywood Reporter|access-date= October 25, 2016|quote=Springsteen and Kovic have been friendly for more than 30 years and the B-side song on the \"Born in the USA\" single, \"Shut Out the Light,\" was written by the Boss about Kovic.}}</ref> [[Tom Paxton]], the folk singer/political activist, wrote the song \"Born on the Fourth of July\", which is on his 1977 ''New Songs from the Briarpatch'' album, and met Kovic backstage at the Bottom Line Club in New York City the same year.\n\n==Personal life==\nKovic is the uncle of internet personality [[Adam Kovic]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Funhaus|title=Hottest Men In Hollywood - Dude Soup Podcast #219|date=2019-03-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jheil4TrKKE&t=107|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\n[[File:Ron Kovic (2105823755).jpg|thumb|right|Kovic in 1990 at the [[62nd Academy Awards]]]]\n*1973 \u2013 ''Operation Last Patrol''.

The idea of opening a new academy in the neighborhood had been in the air ever since the closing in 1834 of the [[Round Hill School]] in nearby [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]].<ref name=Harpers>{{cite journal |title=A Group of Classical Schools (II) |journal=Harper's New Monthly Magazine |date=October 1877 |page=706 }}</ref> In its early days, there was no arrangement of studies by terms and the students were not classified. Luther Wright, its principal from 1841 to 1849, believed it was desirable to have his pupils study together in a single room under his direction. However, the school's student population grew rapidly and the one-room schoolhouse scheme was soon no longer practicable, as more instructors and new buildings were added. By the 1850s the schools campus was dominated by three large buildings: North Hall, Middle Hall and South Hall. For many years the school was co-educational, with the students divided and taught separately in male and female departments, but in 1864 the female division was discontinued.<ref name=Cutter>{{cite book |title=Genealogical and personal memoirs relating to the families of the state of Massachusetts |authorlink=William Richard Cutter |last=Cutter |first=William Richard |publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Co. |year=1910 |url={{GBurl|id=kmujIJi3_FkC|p=338|dq=Williston+Academy+founded+Easthampton+Massachusetts}} |page=338 }}</ref><ref name=Howard>{{cite book |title=The life story of Henry Clay Trumbull |first=Philip Eugene |last=Howard |publisher=International Committee of Young Men's Christian Association |year=1906 |url={{GBurl|haLDRAAAAMAAJ|p=39}} |page=39 }}</ref>\n\nThe seminary comprised two faculties: classical and scientific. With the departure in 1863 of the school's second president, [[Josiah Clark]], a classicist Greek and Latin scholar who had vigorously fought against the expansion of the English department, the school's curriculum began to be modernized. Samuel Williston remained the dominant influence in the school's growth until his death in 1874. In the late 19th century the dual curricula had evolved into a more modern comprehensive course (e.g. with \"scientific and preparatory departments\",<ref name=Indep1914>{{cite news |title=Williston Seminary |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n41/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=July 6, 1914 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref> and in 1924 the school was renamed Williston Academy.

Luther Wright, its principal from 1841 to 1849, believed it was desirable to have his pupils study together in a single room under his direction. However, the school's student population grew rapidly and the one-room schoolhouse scheme was soon no longer practicable, as more instructors and new buildings were added. By the 1850s the schools campus was dominated by three large buildings: North Hall, Middle Hall and South Hall. For many years the school was co-educational, with the students divided and taught separately in male and female departments, but in 1864 the female division was discontinued.<ref name=Cutter>{{cite book |title=Genealogical and personal memoirs relating to the families of the state of Massachusetts |authorlink=William Richard Cutter |last=Cutter |first=William Richard |publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Co. |year=1910 |url={{GBurl|id=kmujIJi3_FkC|p=338|dq=Williston+Academy+founded+Easthampton+Massachusetts}} |page=338 }}</ref><ref name=Howard>{{cite book |title=The life story of Henry Clay Trumbull |first=Philip Eugene |last=Howard |publisher=International Committee of Young Men's Christian Association |year=1906 |url={{GBurl|haLDRAAAAMAAJ|p=39}} |page=39 }}</ref>\n\nThe seminary comprised two faculties: classical and scientific. With the departure in 1863 of the school's second president, [[Josiah Clark]], a classicist Greek and Latin scholar who had vigorously fought against the expansion of the English department, the school's curriculum began to be modernized. Samuel Williston remained the dominant influence in the school's growth until his death in 1874.
