Apart from minor technical alterations, mainly to accommodate the new generation of engines, the external design received a facelift to give the buses a less angular look, with internal panelling altered accordingly. Production of the old model ceased by autumn 2006.\n\nIn 2006 the Citaro received a much more substantial facelift, which can be seen from the outside by a revised front and rear design (analogous to the recently introduced low-entry buses). The hitherto characteristic feature of the first series, the \"washboard trim\" on the front of the vehicle, which was also available as a front advertising area and smooth surface without Mercedes star, accounted for a somewhat rounded front baffle. The lateral sweep of the front turn signals was reversed.\n\nIn May 2011, the second generation Citaro, referred to internally as the C2, was launched.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://roter-renner.de/nc/detail/datum/2011/05/20/die-entwicklung-steckt-im-detail.html |title=Die Entwicklung steckt im Detail |website=Der Rote Renner |date=20 May 2011 |access-date=21 August 2015 |language=German |trans-title=The development is in the details}}</ref> From 2012, the C2 could also be equipped with Euro 6 engines.

However, all models are available with either version.\n\nOther customizations include the number and type of doors as well as the internal layout. Two types of seats are offered as part of the standard range, again with a basic model for urban use and an enhanced version for longer-distance routes, although both also are available on all models.\n\nAside from the usual [[diesel engine]]s, the Citaro is also available with a powerful [[Euro IV]] [[compressed natural gas|natural gas]] engine (model M&nbsp;447&nbsp;hLAG) rated at 185&nbsp;kW (252&nbsp;PS) or 240&nbsp;kW (326&nbsp;PS) - the latter rating used mainly for interurban and articulated buses or standard-length city buses operating in areas with a hilly topography. These engines are also optionally available with [[Enhanced environmentally friendly vehicle|Enhanced Environmentally friendly Vehicle]] (EEV) certification, meaning that their emission levels are lower than even the most stringent [[European Union]] emissions standards.\n\n===Non-standard bodies===\n[[File:Mercedes irvine citaro sst.JPG|thumb|Irvine-Citaro of \u00dcSTRA [[Hannover]]]]\nAs a one-off, German operators [[\u00fcstra]] of [[Hanover]] and [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe|LVB]] of [[Leipzig]] took delivery of a batch of Citaros bodied to a special design by [[James Irvine (designer)|James Irvine]] for [[Expo 2000]]. Leipzig's vehicles were lent to Hanover for the duration of the exhibition, but subsequently returned to normal service in their home city. All other Citaros bodied by Mercedes-Benz were to standard designs, however a number of chassis were bodied by independent manufacturers, most notably [[Carrosserie Hess|Hess]] of Switzerland. However, the Citaro has more recently only been sold as a complete product.\n\nIn 2007 the workshops of the [[Szeged]] (Hungary) bus operator SZKT converted a regular Citaro to a trolleybus. As of April 2010, five such buses are already serving as a trolley and more examples are in preparation in the near future.<ref>YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB-7K4N7PtI Mercedes-Benz Citaro trolley in Szeged]. Retrieved on 31 October 2007.</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Centre of Ambulance Services in [[Dubai]] took delivery of three Citaros, which had been modified to become the world's largest [[ambulance]]s.\n\nIn 2010, the French city [[Rennes]] ordered a longer version of the Citaro, the '''Citaro M''', which is 13 meters long with an urban arrangement. 15&nbsp;vehicles were built over the chassis of the Setra S416NF.\n\n===Hydrogen fuel cell version===\n[[File:2010 09 27 Hannover 151150 (8599634777).jpg|thumb|Citaro FuelCell Hybrid 1st generation facelift at IAA Hannover 2010]]\n\nEven though the usual Citaro models are powered by [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] or [[natural gas]], there is also a [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]]-powered version, designated ''Citaro BZ'' or ''O530BZ''. About 35 of these buses have been in service in a variety of different world cities in order to [[Fuel cell bus trial|test the feasibility of hydrogen fuel cells]] in different operating circumstances and different conditions, especially weather conditions.\n\n===Hybrid electric version===\nThe Mercedes-Benz Citaro G BlueTec Hybrid is a [[hybrid electric bus|series-hybrid]] [[articulated bus]] with a compact 450&nbsp;kg, 4-cylinder, 4.8-litre, 160&nbsp;kW, Euro&nbsp;4 OM-924LA diesel engine providing power for a roof-mounted 19.4&nbsp;kWh [[lithium-ion battery]] pack, and four 80&nbsp;kW electric wheel [[hub motor]]s located on the centre and rear axles. (Contrast a conventional bus diesel engine: 6-cylinder, 12-litre, 1,000&nbsp;kg.) The battery pack is also charged by [[regenerative braking]] (recuperation). The manufacturer anticipates fuel consumption 20% lower than conventional diesel Citaros.\n<ref name=\"hybrid1\">{{cite web|url = http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/01/mercedes-benz-c.html|title = Mercedes-Benz Citaro G Bluetec Hybrid Bus Given 2008 DEKRA Environmental Award|publisher = Green Car Congress|date = 2008-01-31|accessdate = 2009-02-23}}</ref><ref name=\"hybrid2\">{{cite web|url = http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/01/citaro_hybrid_bus_dekra_2008.php|title = Citaro Hybrid Bus Wins 2008 DEKRA Environmental Award|author = Michael Graham Richard|publisher = Treehugger|date = 2008-01-31|accessdate = 2009-02-23}}</ref><ref name=\"hybrid3\">{{cite web|url = http://www2.mercedes-benz.co.uk/content/unitedkingdom/mpc/mpc_unitedkingdom_website/en/home_mpc/buses/home/bus_world/whats_new/News_2008/umweltpreis.0002.html|title = The 2008 DEKRA environmental award - The Citaro G Blue Tec Hybrid bus|publisher = Mercedes-Benz - Omnibus News|year = 2008|accessdate = 2009-02-23}}</ref> In 2010, selected bendy buses were delivered in hybrid version to Wuppertal, Stuttgart, Krefeld, Hamburg and M\u00fclheim.

Instead, in 2017, they launched '''Citaro Hybrid''' variants of diesel and CNG Citaro, which uses [[mild hybrid]] drive, much cheaper to manufacture than ''BlueTec Hybrid'' drive. It uses 14 kW, disc-shaped electric motor mounted between combustion engine and transmission for energy recuperation and can provide a torque of up to 220 Nm.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.mercedes-benz-bus.com/en_GB/models/citaro-hybrid/efficiency/hybrid-technology.html |title= ''Citaro hybrid: Hybrid technology'' |publisher= Mercedes-Benz Buses and Coaches UK |access-date= 2019-12-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Battery version / eCitaro===\n[[File:ASEAG 999.jpg|thumb|A battery-powered Citaro G 1st generation facelift operated by ASEAG Aachen]]\nSince 2015, [[Aachen]] Transport runs a battery-powered Citaro articulated bus as a test in scheduled operation. The vehicle was converted in 2014 from a hybrid bus to a battery bus. They removed all diesel components and installed 1300 traction batteries with a total capacity of approximately 180 kWh. The axle loads remained unchanged. The vehicle has four wheel hub motors with 60&nbsp;kW continuous power on the second and third axle and has a range of more than 50 kilometers. The conversion was carried out as part of the EU project Civitas (Cleaner and better transport in cities) and was funded by the Aachen Transport Association to 75 percent. The costs for the hardware (e.g. batteries) amounted to approximately 700,000 euros.\n\nMercedes-Benz tested prototypes of the Citaro with full electric drive. The bus features a modular battery pack design and use the same electric wheel hub motors as the Citaro G BlueTec Hybrid.

This is expected to save on spare parts inventory - this can be done together with the same diesel buses of the dispenser series - as well as lower acquisition costs compared to standard production trolleybuses. The modified type designation is O-530 Tr12, the six wagons bear the operating numbers T-860 to T-865.\n\nIn 2012, two Citaro trolleybuses also went into operation in Polish [[Gdynia]].

Apart from minor technical alterations, mainly to accommodate the new generation of engines, the external design received a facelift to give the buses a less angular look, with internal panelling altered accordingly. Production of the old model ceased by autumn 2006.\n\nIn 2006 the Citaro received a much more substantial facelift, which can be seen from the outside by a revised front and rear design (analogous to the recently introduced low-entry buses). The hitherto characteristic feature of the first series, the \"washboard trim\" on the front of the vehicle, which was also available as a front advertising area and smooth surface without Mercedes star, accounted for a somewhat rounded front baffle.

However, all models are available with either version.\n\nOther customizations include the number and type of doors as well as the internal layout. Two types of seats are offered as part of the standard range, again with a basic model for urban use and an enhanced version for longer-distance routes, although both also are available on all models.\n\nAside from the usual [[diesel engine]]s, the Citaro is also available with a powerful [[Euro IV]] [[compressed natural gas|natural gas]] engine (model M&nbsp;447&nbsp;hLAG) rated at 185&nbsp;kW (252&nbsp;PS) or 240&nbsp;kW (326&nbsp;PS) - the latter rating used mainly for interurban and articulated buses or standard-length city buses operating in areas with a hilly topography. These engines are also optionally available with [[Enhanced environmentally friendly vehicle|Enhanced Environmentally friendly Vehicle]] (EEV) certification, meaning that their emission levels are lower than even the most stringent [[European Union]] emissions standards.\n\n===Non-standard bodies===\n[[File:Mercedes irvine citaro sst.JPG|thumb|Irvine-Citaro of \u00dcSTRA [[Hannover]]]]\nAs a one-off, German operators [[\u00fcstra]] of [[Hanover]] and [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe|LVB]] of [[Leipzig]] took delivery of a batch of Citaros bodied to a special design by [[James Irvine (designer)|James Irvine]] for [[Expo 2000]]. Leipzig's vehicles were lent to Hanover for the duration of the exhibition, but subsequently returned to normal service in their home city. All other Citaros bodied by Mercedes-Benz were to standard designs, however a number of chassis were bodied by independent manufacturers, most notably [[Carrosserie Hess|Hess]] of Switzerland. However, the Citaro has more recently only been sold as a complete product.\n\nIn 2007 the workshops of the [[Szeged]] (Hungary) bus operator SZKT converted a regular Citaro to a trolleybus. As of April 2010, five such buses are already serving as a trolley and more examples are in preparation in the near future.<ref>YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB-7K4N7PtI Mercedes-Benz Citaro trolley in Szeged]. Retrieved on 31 October 2007.</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Centre of Ambulance Services in [[Dubai]] took delivery of three Citaros, which had been modified to become the world's largest [[ambulance]]s.\n\nIn 2010, the French city [[Rennes]] ordered a longer version of the Citaro, the '''Citaro M''', which is 13 meters long with an urban arrangement. 15&nbsp;vehicles were built over the chassis of the Setra S416NF.\n\n===Hydrogen fuel cell version===\n[[File:2010 09 27 Hannover 151150 (8599634777).jpg|thumb|Citaro FuelCell Hybrid 1st generation facelift at IAA Hannover 2010]]\n\nEven though the usual Citaro models are powered by [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] or [[natural gas]], there is also a [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]]-powered version, designated ''Citaro BZ'' or ''O530BZ''. About 35 of these buses have been in service in a variety of different world cities in order to [[Fuel cell bus trial|test the feasibility of hydrogen fuel cells]] in different operating circumstances and different conditions, especially weather conditions.\n\n===Hybrid electric version===\nThe Mercedes-Benz Citaro G BlueTec Hybrid is a [[hybrid electric bus|series-hybrid]] [[articulated bus]] with a compact 450&nbsp;kg, 4-cylinder, 4.8-litre, 160&nbsp;kW, Euro&nbsp;4 OM-924LA diesel engine providing power for a roof-mounted 19.4&nbsp;kWh [[lithium-ion battery]] pack, and four 80&nbsp;kW electric wheel [[hub motor]]s located on the centre and rear axles. (Contrast a conventional bus diesel engine: 6-cylinder, 12-litre, 1,000&nbsp;kg.) The battery pack is also charged by [[regenerative braking]] (recuperation). The manufacturer anticipates fuel consumption 20% lower than conventional diesel Citaros.\n<ref name=\"hybrid1\">{{cite web|url = http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/01/mercedes-benz-c.html|title = Mercedes-Benz Citaro G Bluetec Hybrid Bus Given 2008 DEKRA Environmental Award|publisher = Green Car Congress|date = 2008-01-31|accessdate = 2009-02-23}}</ref><ref name=\"hybrid2\">{{cite web|url = http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/01/citaro_hybrid_bus_dekra_2008.php|title = Citaro Hybrid Bus Wins 2008 DEKRA Environmental Award|author = Michael Graham Richard|publisher = Treehugger|date = 2008-01-31|accessdate = 2009-02-23}}</ref><ref name=\"hybrid3\">{{cite web|url = http://www2.mercedes-benz.co.uk/content/unitedkingdom/mpc/mpc_unitedkingdom_website/en/home_mpc/buses/home/bus_world/whats_new/News_2008/umweltpreis.0002.html|title = The 2008 DEKRA environmental award - The Citaro G Blue Tec Hybrid bus|publisher = Mercedes-Benz - Omnibus News|year = 2008|accessdate = 2009-02-23}}</ref> In 2010, selected bendy buses were delivered in hybrid version to Wuppertal, Stuttgart, Krefeld, Hamburg and M\u00fclheim.

Instead, in 2017, they launched '''Citaro Hybrid''' variants of diesel and CNG Citaro, which uses [[mild hybrid]] drive, much cheaper to manufacture than ''BlueTec Hybrid'' drive. It uses 14 kW, disc-shaped electric motor mounted between combustion engine and transmission for energy recuperation and can provide a torque of up to 220 Nm.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.mercedes-benz-bus.com/en_GB/models/citaro-hybrid/efficiency/hybrid-technology.html |title= ''Citaro hybrid: Hybrid technology'' |publisher= Mercedes-Benz Buses and Coaches UK |access-date= 2019-12-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Battery version / eCitaro===\n[[File:ASEAG 999.jpg|thumb|A battery-powered Citaro G 1st generation facelift operated by ASEAG Aachen]]\nSince 2015, [[Aachen]] Transport runs a battery-powered Citaro articulated bus as a test in scheduled operation. The vehicle was converted in 2014 from a hybrid bus to a battery bus. They removed all diesel components and installed 1300 traction batteries with a total capacity of approximately 180 kWh. The axle loads remained unchanged. The vehicle has four wheel hub motors with 60&nbsp;kW continuous power on the second and third axle and has a range of more than 50 kilometers. The conversion was carried out as part of the EU project Civitas (Cleaner and better transport in cities) and was funded by the Aachen Transport Association to 75 percent. The costs for the hardware (e.g. batteries) amounted to approximately 700,000 euros.\n\nMercedes-Benz tested prototypes of the Citaro with full electric drive. The bus features a modular battery pack design and use the same electric wheel hub motors as the Citaro G BlueTec Hybrid.

This is expected to save on spare parts inventory - this can be done together with the same diesel buses of the dispenser series - as well as lower acquisition costs compared to standard production trolleybuses. The modified type designation is O-530 Tr12, the six wagons bear the operating numbers T-860 to T-865.\n\nIn 2012, two Citaro trolleybuses also went into operation in Polish [[Gdynia]].

The originator and organiser for the project was Colin Dishington, a member of the Dorset Branch of the RMA, since renamed the Poole and District Branch. A suitable site was chosen on an exposed headland looking out over the wild seas of Kimmeridge Bay with a view down to Chapman's Pool and along the rugged Jurassic coastline to Portland. The site also overlooks a training area used by the Royal Marines both during World War II and since; in addition, it fitted the beauty and tranquility required for the memorial location. The land, which is within the boundary of the Enscombe estate, was freely given by the then owner, David Scott (Lt Col ret'd), and right of access to the site is written into the deeds of the tenant farmer.  It was decided to add to the initial Deal inscription to remember Royal Marines lost in all the conflicts from 1945-1990. As well as bearing the Corps' crest, the original stone also bears a message to passing walkers and those that come to pay their respects:<blockquote>Rest awhile and reflect that we who are living can enjoy the beauty of the sea and countryside.</blockquote>In 2005 a new stone was added to commemorate ongoing losses of Royal Marines in current conflicts over more recent years. A service of dedication was conducted by the Rev. W. Aires, with the stone unveiled by Maj.-Gen. F. C. Barton, CB CBE RM, on 19 August 2006. Each year since the unveiling, a service has been conducted by the RMA at the memorial. The calls are sounded by a serving RM bugler from the RM Band Service.  Details of the monument are registered with the Imperial War Museum's Monument section and local guides give reference to it. Access to the site is by footpath from the car park at Renscombe Farm. The original three-bar wooden rail fence has been replaced by a Purbeck stone wall to blend in with the stone walls of the area, and gives better protection to the garden, which is maintained by volunteers from the Poole and District RMA. As the site is on the main coastal path many people pause to reflect at the memorial, or use it as a resting point on their walk to enjoy the views. The ashes of RMA members have also been scattered in the monument gardens, and the families of those lost and resting elsewhere often visit the site, a truly peaceful and fitting memorial to the members of the Royal Marines family who have given their lives since WW2.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Dorset beaches]]\n* [[Jurassic Coast]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Chapmans_pool_to_hounstout.JPG|View across the cove to Hounstout\nImage:Crushed_ammonite_fossil_chapmans_pool_dorset.jpg|Crushed ammonite fossil on the beach\nImage:Chapmans pool panorama.jpg|Panoramic view of the cove\nImage:Chapmans pool from the west.jpg|The cove from the west\nImage:Chapmans pool beach and cliffs.jpg|Shale beach and cliffs\nImage:Chapmans pool from hounstout.jpg|The cove from Hounstout cliff\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Chapman's Pool}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060923120814/http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/kimpool.htm Ian West's ''Geology of the Wessex Coast'' Field Guide], including photographs\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070620183600/http://www.nci-st-albans.org.uk/ National Coastwatch Institution St Alban's Head Website]\n\n{{coord|50.59348|-2.06440|type:waterbody_region:GB|display=title}}\n{{Jurassic Coast}}\n\n[[Category:Landforms of Dorset]]\n[[Category:Isle of Purbeck]]\n[[Category:Coves of England]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:Chapman's Pool from Emmett's Hill.JPG|thumb|400px|Chapman's Pool, Dorset, seen from Emmett's Hill.]]\n\n'''Chapman's Pool''' is a small cove to the west of [[Worth Matravers]] on the [[Isle of Purbeck]], in [[Dorset]], [[England]].\n\n==Chapman's Pool Lifeboat==\nIn 1866, after much local pressure and because many lives were lost at sea nearby, the decision was made to build a [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] station at Chapman's Pool.

A service of dedication was conducted by the Rev. W. Aires, with the stone unveiled by Maj.-Gen. F. C. Barton, CB CBE RM, on 19 August 2006. Each year since the unveiling, a service has been conducted by the RMA at the memorial. The calls are sounded by a serving RM bugler from the RM Band Service.  Details of the monument are registered with the Imperial War Museum's Monument section and local guides give reference to it. Access to the site is by footpath from the car park at Renscombe Farm. The original three-bar wooden rail fence has been replaced by a Purbeck stone wall to blend in with the stone walls of the area, and gives better protection to the garden, which is maintained by volunteers from the Poole and District RMA. As the site is on the main coastal path many people pause to reflect at the memorial, or use it as a resting point on their walk to enjoy the views. The ashes of RMA members have also been scattered in the monument gardens, and the families of those lost and resting elsewhere often visit the site, a truly peaceful and fitting memorial to the members of the Royal Marines family who have given their lives since WW2.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Dorset beaches]]\n* [[Jurassic Coast]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Chapmans_pool_to_hounstout.JPG|View across the cove to Hounstout\nImage:Crushed_ammonite_fossil_chapmans_pool_dorset.jpg|Crushed ammonite fossil on the beach\nImage:Chapmans pool panorama.jpg|Panoramic view of the cove\nImage:Chapmans pool from the west.jpg|The cove from the west\nImage:Chapmans pool beach and cliffs.jpg|Shale beach and cliffs\nImage:Chapmans pool from hounstout.jpg|The cove from Hounstout cliff\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Chapman's Pool}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060923120814/http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/kimpool.htm Ian West's ''Geology of the Wessex Coast'' Field Guide], including photographs\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070620183600/http://www.nci-st-albans.org.uk/ National Coastwatch Institution St Alban's Head Website]\n\n{{coord|50.59348|-2.06440|type:waterbody_region:GB|display=title}}\n{{Jurassic Coast}}\n\n[[Category:Landforms of Dorset]]\n[[Category:Isle of Purbeck]]\n[[Category:Coves of England]]\n", "name_user": "Stavast22", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eChapman's Pool Lifeboat:Tidy sentence, and wikilink 'landslip'.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapmans_Pool"}

He dominated the [[Walpole\u2013Townshend ministry]], as well as the subsequent [[Walpole ministry]], and holds the record as the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by tenure|longest-serving British prime minister in history]]. [[William Arthur Speck|W. A. Speck]] wrote that Walpole's uninterrupted run of 20 years as Prime Minister \"is rightly regarded as one of the major feats of British political history...&nbsp;Explanations are usually offered in terms of his expert handling of the political system after 1720, [and] his unique blending of the surviving powers of the crown with the increasing influence of the Commons\".<ref>W. A. Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714\u20131760'' (1977) p. 203</ref>\n\nWalpole was a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] from the [[gentry]] class who was first elected to Parliament in 1701 and held many senior positions. He was a [[Squire#England|country squire]] and looked to country gentlemen for his political base. Historian Frank O'Gorman says his leadership in Parliament reflected his \"reasonable and persuasive oratory, his ability to move both the emotions as well as the minds of men, and, above all, his extraordinary self-confidence\".<ref>Frank O'Gorman, ''The Long Eighteenth Century: British Political and Social History 1688\u20131832'' (1997), p. 71</ref> Hoppit says Walpole's policies sought moderation: he worked for peace, lower taxes and growing exports and allowed a little more tolerance for Protestant Dissenters. He mostly avoided controversy and high-intensity disputes as his middle way attracted moderates from both the Whig and Tory camps,<ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty? England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) p. 410</ref> but his appointment to [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] stock-market crisis drew attention to a perceived protection of political allies by Walpole.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[H. T. Dickinson]] sums up his historical role by saying that \"Walpole was one of the greatest politicians in British history. He played a significant role in sustaining the Whig party, safeguarding the Hanoverian succession, and defending the principles of the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688)....He established a stable political supremacy for the Whig party and taught succeeding ministers how best to establish an effective working relationship between Crown and Parliament\".<ref>[[H. T. Dickinson]], \"Walpole, Sir Robert\", in David Loads, editor, ''Reader's Guide to British History'' (2003) p. 1338</ref> Scholars rank him highly among all British prime ministers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul Strangio|author2=Paul 't Hart|author3=James Walter|title=Understanding Prime-Ministerial Performance: Comparative Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMu2nAZmMbEC&pg=PA225|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|page=225|isbn=9780199666423}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWalpole was born in [[Houghton, Norfolk|Houghton]], Norfolk in 1676. One of 19 children, he was the third son and fifth child of [[Robert Walpole (1650\u20131700)|Robert Walpole]], a member of the local gentry and a Whig politician who represented the borough of [[Castle Rising]] in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], and his wife Mary Walpole, the daughter and heiress of Sir Geoffrey Burwell of [[Rougham, Suffolk]].  [[Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole]] was his younger brother.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n==Education and early business success==\nAs a child, Walpole attended a private school at [[Great Massingham|Massingham, Norfolk]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} Walpole entered [[Eton College]] in 1690{{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} where he was considered \"an excellent scholar\". He left Eton on 2 April 1696{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} and matriculated at [[King's College, Cambridge]] on the same day.{{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} On 25 May 1698, he left Cambridge after the death of his only remaining elder brother, Edward, so that he could help his father administer the family estate to which he had become the heir. Walpole had planned to become a clergyman but as he was now the eldest surviving son in the family, he abandoned the idea. In November 1700 his father died, and Robert succeeded to inherit the [[Walpole family|Walpole estate]]. A paper in his father's handwriting, dated 9 June 1700, shows the family estate in Norfolk and Suffolk to have been nine manors in Norfolk and one in Suffolk.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}\n\nAs a young man, Walpole had bought [[Share (finance)|shares]] in the [[South Sea Company]], which monopolized trade with Spain, the Caribbean and South America. The speculative market for slaves, rum and mahogany spawned a frenzy that had ramifications throughout Europe when it collapsed. However, Walpole had bought at the bottom and sold at the top, adding greatly to his inherited wealth and allowing him to create [[Houghton Hall]] as seen today.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Glentzer|first1=Molly|title='Houghton Hall' peeks at a real 'Downton Abbey'|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/arts-theater/article/Houghton-Hall-peeks-at-a-real-Downton-Abbey-5568249.php|newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date= 20 June 2014|accessdate=5 March 2016|quote=As a young man, Sir Robert bought shares of the South Seas Co., which monopolized trade with Spain, the Caribbean and South America. The speculative market for slaves, rum and mahogany spawned a frenzy that had ramifications throughout Europe when it collapsed. \"But Walpole bought at the bottom and sold at the top,\" Tinterow said. That fortune enabled him to build Houghton.}}</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nWalpole's political career began in January 1701 when he won a seat in the general election at [[Castle Rising (UK Parliament constituency)|Castle Rising]]. He left Castle Rising in 1702 so that he could represent the neighbouring borough of [[King's Lynn (UK Parliament constituency)|King's Lynn]], a [[pocket borough]] that would re-elect him for the remainder of his political career. Voters and politicians nicknamed him \"Robin\".{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}\n\nLike his father, Robert Walpole was a member of the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180, 181}} In 1705, Walpole was appointed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] to be a member of the council for her husband, [[Prince George of Denmark]], [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]. After having been singled out in a struggle between the Whigs and the government, Walpole became the intermediary for reconciling the government to the Whig leaders. His abilities were recognised by [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Lord Godolphin]] (the [[Lord High Treasurer]] and leader of the Cabinet) and he was subsequently appointed to the position of [[Secretary at War]] in 1708; for a short period of time in 1710 he also simultaneously held the post of [[Treasurer of the Navy]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=181\u201382}}\n\nDespite his personal clout, however, Walpole could not stop Lord Godolphin and the Whigs from pressing for the prosecution of [[Henry Sacheverell]], a minister who preached anti-Whig sermons. The trial was extremely unpopular with much of the country, causing the [[Sacheverell riots]], and was followed by the downfall of the Duke of Marlborough and the Whig Party in the general election of 1710. The new ministry, under the leadership of the Tory [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]], removed Walpole from his office of Secretary at War but he remained Treasurer of the Navy until 2 January 1711. Harley had first attempted to entice him and then threatened him to join the Tories, but Walpole rejected the offers, instead becoming one of the most outspoken members of the Whig Opposition.  He effectively defended Lord Godolphin against Tory attacks in parliamentary debate, as well as in the press.<ref>Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714\u20131760'' (1977) pp 206\u20139</ref>\n\nIn 1712, Walpole was accused of [[venality]] and corruption in the matter of two forage contracts for Scotland. Although it was proven that he had retained none of the money, Walpole was pronounced \"guilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption\".{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}} He was impeached by the House of Commons and found guilty by the [[House of Lords]]; he was then imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] for six months and expelled from Parliament. While in the Tower he was regarded as a political martyr, and visited by all the Whig leaders. After he was released, Walpole wrote and published anonymous pamphlets attacking the Harley ministry and assisted Sir [[Richard Steele]] in crafting political pamphlets. Walpole was re-elected for King's Lynn in 1713.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}}\n\n==Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry==\n{{Main|First Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry|Second Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry}}\nQueen Anne died in 1714.

He used his influence to prevent George II from entering the [[War of the Polish Succession]] in 1733, because it was a dispute between the Bourbons and the Habsburgs. He boasted, \"There are 50,000 men slain in Europe this year, and not one Englishman.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=C. Grant Robertson|title=England under the Hanoverians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVG7Nls67aQC&pg=PA66|year=1921|page=66}}</ref> By avoiding wars, Walpole could lower taxes.  He reduced the national debt with a sinking fund, and by negotiating lower interest rates.  He reduced the land tax from four shillings in 1721, to 3s in 1728, 2s in 1731 and finally to only 1s in 1732.  His long-term goal was to replace the land tax, which was paid by the local gentry, with excise and customs taxes, which were paid by merchants and ultimately by consumers.  Walpole joked that the landed gentry resembled hogs, which squealed loudly whenever anyone laid hands on him.  By contrast, he said, merchants were like sheep, and yielded their wool without complaint.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.W. Ward et al. eds. |title=The Cambridge Modern History: Volume VI: the Eighteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMgFAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA46|year=1909|page=46}}</ref> The joke backfired in 1733 when he was defeated in a major battle to impose excise taxes on wine and tobacco. To reduce the threat of smuggling, the tax was to be collected not at ports but at warehouses. This new proposal, however, was extremely unpopular and aroused the opposition of the nation's merchants. Walpole agreed to withdraw the bill before Parliament voted on it, but he dismissed the politicians who had dared to oppose it in the first place. Thus, Walpole lost a considerable element of his Whig Party to the Opposition.<ref>Paul Langford, ''A polite and commercial people: England, 1727\u20131783'' (1998). pp 28\u201333</ref>\n\nAfter the general elections of 1734, Walpole's supporters still formed a majority in the House of Commons although they were less numerous than before.

Walpole's domination over the House of Commons was highlighted by the ease with which he secured the rejection of Sir John Barnard's plan to reduce the interest on the national debt. Walpole was also able to persuade Parliament to pass the [[Licensing Act 1737|Licensing Act of 1737]] under which London theatres were regulated.<ref>{{harvnb|Leadam|1899|pp=195\u2013196}} 10 Geo.

They defended Walpole from the charge of evil political corruption by arguing that corruption is the universal human condition. Furthermore, they argued, political divisiveness was also universal and inevitable because of selfish passions that were integral to human nature. Arnall argued that government must be strong enough to control conflict, and in that regard Walpole was quite successful.

Though her death did not end his personal influence with George II, who had grown loyal to the Prime Minister during the preceding years, Walpole's domination of government continued to decline. His opponents acquired a vocal leader in the [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] who was estranged from his father, the King. Several young politicians including [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] and [[George Grenville]] formed a faction known as the \"[[Patriot Whigs|Patriot Boys]]\" and joined the Prince of Wales in opposition.<ref>{{Citation|first=Keith |last=Laybourn |year=2001 |title=British Political Leaders: A Biographical Dictionary |publisher=ABC-CLIO |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IolLcc5htJoC&pg=PA319 319]\u201320}}</ref>\n\nWalpole's failure to maintain a policy of avoiding military conflict eventually led to his fall from power.<ref>{{Citation |first=J.H. |last=Plumb |year=1960 |title=Sir Robert Walpole; the Making of a Statesman: The King's Minister|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brYNAQAAMAAJ |publisher=Cresset Press |page={{page needed|date=March 2014}} }}</ref> Under the [[Treaty of Seville (1729)|Treaty of Seville]] (1729), Great Britain agreed not to trade with the Spanish colonies in North America.

In 1739 Walpole abandoned all efforts to stop the conflict and commenced the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (so called because [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Robert Jenkins]], a Welsh mariner, claimed that a Spaniard inspecting his vessel had severed his ear).{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWalpole's influence continued to dramatically decline even after the war began. In the [[1741 British general election|1741 general election]] his supporters secured an increase in votes in constituencies that were decided by mass electorates but failed to win in many [[rotten borough|pocket boroughs]] (constituencies subject to the informal but strong influence of patrons). In general the government made gains in England and [[Wales]] but this was not enough to overturn the reverses of the [[1734 British general election|1734 election]] and further losses in [[Cornwall]] where many constituencies were obedient to the will of the Prince of Wales (who was also [[Duke of Cornwall]]). These constituencies returned members of parliament hostile to the Prime Minister. Similarly, the influence of the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] secured the election of members opposed to Walpole in some parts of Scotland. Walpole's new majority was difficult to determine because of the uncertain loyalties of many new members, but contemporaries and historians estimated it as low as fourteen to eighteen.<ref>{{Citation |last=Speck|first=W.

Moreover, his majority was not as strong as it had formerly been, his detractors\u2014such as William Pulteney, earl of Bath, and Lord Perceval\u2014being approximately as numerous as his supporters. Behind these political enemies were opposition Whigs, Tories and Jacobites. Walpole was alleged to have presided over an immense increase in corruption and to have enriched himself enormously whilst in office. Parliamentary committees were formed to investigate these charges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/robert-walpole|title=History of Sir Robert Walpole|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref> In 1742 when the House of Commons was prepared to determine the validity of a by-election in [[Chippenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chippenham]], Walpole and others agreed to treat the issue as a [[motion of no confidence]].

His former colleagues were still pleased to see him, perhaps in part because he retained the king's favour. After his resignation, his main political roles were to support the government by means of advice, to dole out some patronage and to speak on the ministry's behalf in the Lords.<ref>Jonathan Oates, \"Sir Robert Walpole after his Fall from Power, 1742\u20131745.\" ''History 91.302'' (2006): 218\u2013230.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nLord Orford was succeeded as Prime Minister by [[Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington|Lord Wilmington]] in an administration whose true head was [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Carteret]]. A committee was created to inquire into Walpole's ministry but no substantial evidence of wrongdoing or corruption was discovered. Though no longer a member of the Cabinet, Orford continued to maintain personal influence with George II and was often dubbed the \"Minister behind the Curtain\" for this advice and influence. In 1744 he managed to secure the dismissal of Carteret and the appointment of [[Henry Pelham]] whom he regarded as a political prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He advised Pelham to make use of his seat in the Commons to serve as a bridge between the King and Parliament, just as Walpole had done.{{sfn|Browning|1975|p=117}}<ref>{{citation |first=Jonathan |last=Aotes |title=Sir Robert Walpole after his Fall from Power, 1742\u20131745 |journal=History |date=April 2006 |volume=91 |issue=302 |pages=218\u2013230 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-229x.2006.00364.x}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Walpole also made two interventions in the Lords. The first was in January 1744 in the debate on Hanoverian troops being kept in British pay. Walpole prevented them from losing the troops. In his second intervention, Walpole, with fear of a Jacobite-inspired invasion in February 1744, made a speech on the situation. Frederick, Prince of Wales, usually hostile to Walpole, warmly received him at his court the next day, most likely because his father's throne, and the future of the whole Hanoverian dynasty, was at risk from the Stuart Pretender.<ref name=\"npg.org.uk\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw04757/Robert-Walpole-1st-Earl-of-Orford|title=Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford \u2013 National Portrait Gallery|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlong with his political interests in his last years, Walpole enjoyed the pleasures of the hunt. Back at his recently rebuilt country seat in Houghton, Norfolk, such pastimes were denied him due to \"dismal weather\".<ref>BL Add.

The Tories became a minor, insignificant faction, and the Whigs became a dominant and largely unopposed party. His influence on the development of the uncodified [[constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution of Great Britain]] was less momentous even though he is regarded as Great Britain's first Prime Minister.<ref name=\":1\" /> He relied primarily on the favour of the King rather than on the support of the House of Commons. His power stemmed from his personal influence instead of the influence of his office. Most of his immediate successors were, comparatively speaking, extremely weak; it would take several decades more for the premiership to develop into the most powerful and most important office in the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWalpole's strategy of keeping Great Britain at peace contributed greatly to the country's prosperity. Walpole also managed to secure the position of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian Dynasty]], and effectively countervailed Jacobitism. The Jacobite threat ended, soon after Walpole's term ended, with the defeat of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|rebellion of 1745]]. Later in the century, the Whig MP [[Edmund Burke]] \"admitted him into the whig pantheon\".<ref>{{cite ODNB|last=Taylor |first=Stephen |id=28601 |title=Walpole, Robert, first earl of Orford (1676\u20131745) |origyear=2004 |date=January 2008 |mode=cs2}}</ref> Burke wrote:\n\n{{quote|He was an honorable man and a sound Whig. He was not, as the Jacobites and discontented Whigs of his time have represented him, and as ill-informed people still represent him, a prodigal and corrupt minister. They charged him in their libels and seditious conversations as having first reduced corruption to a system. Such was their cant. But he was far from governing by corruption. He governed by party attachments. The charge of systematic corruption is less applicable to him, perhaps, than to any minister who ever served the crown for so great a length of time. He gained over very few from the Opposition. Without being a genius of the first class, he was an intelligent, prudent, and safe minister. He loved peace; and he helped to communicate the same disposition to nations at least as warlike and restless as that in which he had the chief direction of affairs. ... With many virtues, public and private, he had his faults; but his faults were superficial. A careless, coarse, and over familiar style of discourse, without sufficient regard to persons or occasions, and an almost total want of political decorum, were the errours by which he was most hurt in the public opinion: and those through which his enemies obtained the greatest advantage over him. But justice must be done. The prudence, steadiness, and vigilance of that man, joined to the greatest possible lenity in his character and his politics, preserved the crown to this royal family; and with it, their laws and liberties to this country.<ref>{{citation |last=Burke |first=Edmund |title=An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs |publisher=The Library of Liberal Arts |year=1962|pages=62\u201363}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] expressed scepticism as to whether \"an impartial Character of Sr Robert Walpole, will or can be transmitted to Posterity, for he governed this Kingdom so long that the various passions of Mankind mingled, and in a manner incorporated themselves, with every thing that was said or writt concerning him. Never was Man more flattered nor more abused, and his long power, was probably the chief cause of both\".{{sfn|Franklin|1993|p=114}} Chesterfield claimed he was \"much acquainted with him both in his publick and his private life\":\n\n{{quote|In private life he was good natured, Chearfull, social.

For he laughed at and ridiculed all notions of Publick virtue, and the love of one's Country, calling them the ''Chimerical school boy flights of Classical learning''; declaring himself at the same time, ''No Saint, no Spartan, no reformer''. He would frequently ask young fellows at their first appearance in the world, while their honest hearts were yet untainted, ''well are you to be an old Roman? a Patriot? you will soon come off of that, and grow wiser''. And thus he was more dangerous to the morals, than to the libertys of his country, to which I am persuaded that he meaned no ill in his heart. ...

George II offered this home to Walpole as a personal gift in 1732, but Walpole accepted it only as the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury, taking up his residence there on 22 September 1735. His immediate successors did not always reside in Number 10 (preferring their larger private residences) but the home has nevertheless become established as the official residence of the Prime Minister (in his or her capacity as First Lord of the Treasury).<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica\"/>\n\nWalpole has attracted attention from heterodox economists as a pioneer of protectionist policies, in the form of tariffs and subsidies to woollen manufacturers.

\"KG, KB\": he resigned the Bath on appointment to the Garter in 1726--> (26 August 1676 \u2013 18 March 1745), known between 1721 and 1742 as '''Sir Robert Walpole''', was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] politician who is generally regarded as the ''de facto'' first [[Prime Minister of Great Britain]].\n\nAlthough the exact dates of Walpole's dominance, dubbed the \"Robinocracy\",<ref>{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|Robinocracy}}</ref> are a matter of scholarly debate, the period 1721\u20131742 is often used. He dominated the [[Walpole\u2013Townshend ministry]], as well as the subsequent [[Walpole ministry]], and holds the record as the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by tenure|longest-serving British prime minister in history]]. [[William Arthur Speck|W. A. Speck]] wrote that Walpole's uninterrupted run of 20 years as Prime Minister \"is rightly regarded as one of the major feats of British political history...&nbsp;Explanations are usually offered in terms of his expert handling of the political system after 1720, [and] his unique blending of the surviving powers of the crown with the increasing influence of the Commons\".<ref>W. A. Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714\u20131760'' (1977) p. 203</ref>\n\nWalpole was a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] from the [[gentry]] class who was first elected to Parliament in 1701 and held many senior positions. He was a [[Squire#England|country squire]] and looked to country gentlemen for his political base. Historian Frank O'Gorman says his leadership in Parliament reflected his \"reasonable and persuasive oratory, his ability to move both the emotions as well as the minds of men, and, above all, his extraordinary self-confidence\".<ref>Frank O'Gorman, ''The Long Eighteenth Century: British Political and Social History 1688\u20131832'' (1997), p. 71</ref> Hoppit says Walpole's policies sought moderation: he worked for peace, lower taxes and growing exports and allowed a little more tolerance for Protestant Dissenters. He mostly avoided controversy and high-intensity disputes as his middle way attracted moderates from both the Whig and Tory camps,<ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty? England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) p. 410</ref> but his appointment to [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] stock-market crisis drew attention to a perceived protection of political allies by Walpole.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[H. T. Dickinson]] sums up his historical role by saying that \"Walpole was one of the greatest politicians in British history. He played a significant role in sustaining the Whig party, safeguarding the Hanoverian succession, and defending the principles of the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688)....He established a stable political supremacy for the Whig party and taught succeeding ministers how best to establish an effective working relationship between Crown and Parliament\".<ref>[[H. T. Dickinson]], \"Walpole, Sir Robert\", in David Loads, editor, ''Reader's Guide to British History'' (2003) p. 1338</ref> Scholars rank him highly among all British prime ministers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul Strangio|author2=Paul 't Hart|author3=James Walter|title=Understanding Prime-Ministerial Performance: Comparative Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMu2nAZmMbEC&pg=PA225|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|page=225|isbn=9780199666423}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWalpole was born in [[Houghton, Norfolk|Houghton]], Norfolk in 1676. One of 19 children, he was the third son and fifth child of [[Robert Walpole (1650\u20131700)|Robert Walpole]], a member of the local gentry and a Whig politician who represented the borough of [[Castle Rising]] in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], and his wife Mary Walpole, the daughter and heiress of Sir Geoffrey Burwell of [[Rougham, Suffolk]].  [[Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole]] was his younger brother.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n==Education and early business success==\nAs a child, Walpole attended a private school at [[Great Massingham|Massingham, Norfolk]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} Walpole entered [[Eton College]] in 1690{{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} where he was considered \"an excellent scholar\". He left Eton on 2 April 1696{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} and matriculated at [[King's College, Cambridge]] on the same day.{{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} On 25 May 1698, he left Cambridge after the death of his only remaining elder brother, Edward, so that he could help his father administer the family estate to which he had become the heir. Walpole had planned to become a clergyman but as he was now the eldest surviving son in the family, he abandoned the idea. In November 1700 his father died, and Robert succeeded to inherit the [[Walpole family|Walpole estate]]. A paper in his father's handwriting, dated 9 June 1700, shows the family estate in Norfolk and Suffolk to have been nine manors in Norfolk and one in Suffolk.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}\n\nAs a young man, Walpole had bought [[Share (finance)|shares]] in the [[South Sea Company]], which monopolized trade with Spain, the Caribbean and South America. The speculative market for slaves, rum and mahogany spawned a frenzy that had ramifications throughout Europe when it collapsed. However, Walpole had bought at the bottom and sold at the top, adding greatly to his inherited wealth and allowing him to create [[Houghton Hall]] as seen today.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Glentzer|first1=Molly|title='Houghton Hall' peeks at a real 'Downton Abbey'|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/arts-theater/article/Houghton-Hall-peeks-at-a-real-Downton-Abbey-5568249.php|newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date= 20 June 2014|accessdate=5 March 2016|quote=As a young man, Sir Robert bought shares of the South Seas Co., which monopolized trade with Spain, the Caribbean and South America.

That fortune enabled him to build Houghton.}}</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nWalpole's political career began in January 1701 when he won a seat in the general election at [[Castle Rising (UK Parliament constituency)|Castle Rising]]. He left Castle Rising in 1702 so that he could represent the neighbouring borough of [[King's Lynn (UK Parliament constituency)|King's Lynn]], a [[pocket borough]] that would re-elect him for the remainder of his political career. Voters and politicians nicknamed him \"Robin\".{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}\n\nLike his father, Robert Walpole was a member of the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180, 181}} In 1705, Walpole was appointed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] to be a member of the council for her husband, [[Prince George of Denmark]], [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]. After having been singled out in a struggle between the Whigs and the government, Walpole became the intermediary for reconciling the government to the Whig leaders. His abilities were recognised by [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Lord Godolphin]] (the [[Lord High Treasurer]] and leader of the Cabinet) and he was subsequently appointed to the position of [[Secretary at War]] in 1708; for a short period of time in 1710 he also simultaneously held the post of [[Treasurer of the Navy]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=181\u201382}}\n\nDespite his personal clout, however, Walpole could not stop Lord Godolphin and the Whigs from pressing for the prosecution of [[Henry Sacheverell]], a minister who preached anti-Whig sermons. The trial was extremely unpopular with much of the country, causing the [[Sacheverell riots]], and was followed by the downfall of the Duke of Marlborough and the Whig Party in the general election of 1710. The new ministry, under the leadership of the Tory [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]], removed Walpole from his office of Secretary at War but he remained Treasurer of the Navy until 2 January 1711. Harley had first attempted to entice him and then threatened him to join the Tories, but Walpole rejected the offers, instead becoming one of the most outspoken members of the Whig Opposition.  He effectively defended Lord Godolphin against Tory attacks in parliamentary debate, as well as in the press.<ref>Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714\u20131760'' (1977) pp 206\u20139</ref>\n\nIn 1712, Walpole was accused of [[venality]] and corruption in the matter of two forage contracts for Scotland. Although it was proven that he had retained none of the money, Walpole was pronounced \"guilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption\".{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}} He was impeached by the House of Commons and found guilty by the [[House of Lords]]; he was then imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] for six months and expelled from Parliament. While in the Tower he was regarded as a political martyr, and visited by all the Whig leaders. After he was released, Walpole wrote and published anonymous pamphlets attacking the Harley ministry and assisted Sir [[Richard Steele]] in crafting political pamphlets. Walpole was re-elected for King's Lynn in 1713.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}}\n\n==Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry==\n{{Main|First Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry|Second Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry}}\nQueen Anne died in 1714. Under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which excluded Roman Catholics from the line of succession, Anne was succeeded by her [[second cousin]], the [[Elector of Hanover]], [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]. George I distrusted the Tories, who he believed opposed his right to succeed to the Throne. The year of George's accession, 1714, marked the ascendancy of the Whigs who would remain in power for the next fifty years. Robert Walpole became a [[Privy Council of Great Britain|Privy Councillor]] and rose to the position of [[Paymaster of the Forces]]{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=184}} in a Cabinet nominally led by [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], but actually dominated by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]] (Walpole's brother-in-law) and [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|James Stanhope]].

He used his influence to prevent George II from entering the [[War of the Polish Succession]] in 1733, because it was a dispute between the Bourbons and the Habsburgs. He boasted, \"There are 50,000 men slain in Europe this year, and not one Englishman.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=C. Grant Robertson|title=England under the Hanoverians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVG7Nls67aQC&pg=PA66|year=1921|page=66}}</ref> By avoiding wars, Walpole could lower taxes.  He reduced the national debt with a sinking fund, and by negotiating lower interest rates.  He reduced the land tax from four shillings in 1721, to 3s in 1728, 2s in 1731 and finally to only 1s in 1732.  His long-term goal was to replace the land tax, which was paid by the local gentry, with excise and customs taxes, which were paid by merchants and ultimately by consumers.  Walpole joked that the landed gentry resembled hogs, which squealed loudly whenever anyone laid hands on him.  By contrast, he said, merchants were like sheep, and yielded their wool without complaint.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.W. Ward et al. eds. |title=The Cambridge Modern History: Volume VI: the Eighteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMgFAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA46|year=1909|page=46}}</ref> The joke backfired in 1733 when he was defeated in a major battle to impose excise taxes on wine and tobacco. To reduce the threat of smuggling, the tax was to be collected not at ports but at warehouses. This new proposal, however, was extremely unpopular and aroused the opposition of the nation's merchants. Walpole agreed to withdraw the bill before Parliament voted on it, but he dismissed the politicians who had dared to oppose it in the first place.

Walpole's domination over the House of Commons was highlighted by the ease with which he secured the rejection of Sir John Barnard's plan to reduce the interest on the national debt.

They defended Walpole from the charge of evil political corruption by arguing that corruption is the universal human condition. Furthermore, they argued, political divisiveness was also universal and inevitable because of selfish passions that were integral to human nature.

His opponents acquired a vocal leader in the [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] who was estranged from his father, the King. Several young politicians including [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] and [[George Grenville]] formed a faction known as the \"[[Patriot Whigs|Patriot Boys]]\" and joined the Prince of Wales in opposition.<ref>{{Citation|first=Keith |last=Laybourn |year=2001 |title=British Political Leaders: A Biographical Dictionary |publisher=ABC-CLIO |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IolLcc5htJoC&pg=PA319 319]\u201320}}</ref>\n\nWalpole's failure to maintain a policy of avoiding military conflict eventually led to his fall from power.<ref>{{Citation |first=J.H. |last=Plumb |year=1960 |title=Sir Robert Walpole; the Making of a Statesman: The King's Minister|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brYNAQAAMAAJ |publisher=Cresset Press |page={{page needed|date=March 2014}} }}</ref> Under the [[Treaty of Seville (1729)|Treaty of Seville]] (1729), Great Britain agreed not to trade with the Spanish colonies in North America.

In the [[1741 British general election|1741 general election]] his supporters secured an increase in votes in constituencies that were decided by mass electorates but failed to win in many [[rotten borough|pocket boroughs]] (constituencies subject to the informal but strong influence of patrons). In general the government made gains in England and [[Wales]] but this was not enough to overturn the reverses of the [[1734 British general election|1734 election]] and further losses in [[Cornwall]] where many constituencies were obedient to the will of the Prince of Wales (who was also [[Duke of Cornwall]]). These constituencies returned members of parliament hostile to the Prime Minister. Similarly, the influence of the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] secured the election of members opposed to Walpole in some parts of Scotland. Walpole's new majority was difficult to determine because of the uncertain loyalties of many new members, but contemporaries and historians estimated it as low as fourteen to eighteen.<ref>{{Citation |last=Speck|first=W.

Moreover, his majority was not as strong as it had formerly been, his detractors\u2014such as William Pulteney, earl of Bath, and Lord Perceval\u2014being approximately as numerous as his supporters. Behind these political enemies were opposition Whigs, Tories and Jacobites. Walpole was alleged to have presided over an immense increase in corruption and to have enriched himself enormously whilst in office. Parliamentary committees were formed to investigate these charges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/robert-walpole|title=History of Sir Robert Walpole|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref> In 1742 when the House of Commons was prepared to determine the validity of a by-election in [[Chippenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chippenham]], Walpole and others agreed to treat the issue as a [[motion of no confidence]].

His former colleagues were still pleased to see him, perhaps in part because he retained the king's favour. After his resignation, his main political roles were to support the government by means of advice, to dole out some patronage and to speak on the ministry's behalf in the Lords.<ref>Jonathan Oates, \"Sir Robert Walpole after his Fall from Power, 1742\u20131745.\" ''History 91.302'' (2006): 218\u2013230.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nLord Orford was succeeded as Prime Minister by [[Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington|Lord Wilmington]] in an administration whose true head was [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Carteret]]. A committee was created to inquire into Walpole's ministry but no substantial evidence of wrongdoing or corruption was discovered. Though no longer a member of the Cabinet, Orford continued to maintain personal influence with George II and was often dubbed the \"Minister behind the Curtain\" for this advice and influence. In 1744 he managed to secure the dismissal of Carteret and the appointment of [[Henry Pelham]] whom he regarded as a political prot\u00e9g\u00e9.

The first was in January 1744 in the debate on Hanoverian troops being kept in British pay. Walpole prevented them from losing the troops. In his second intervention, Walpole, with fear of a Jacobite-inspired invasion in February 1744, made a speech on the situation. Frederick, Prince of Wales, usually hostile to Walpole, warmly received him at his court the next day, most likely because his father's throne, and the future of the whole Hanoverian dynasty, was at risk from the Stuart Pretender.<ref name=\"npg.org.uk\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw04757/Robert-Walpole-1st-Earl-of-Orford|title=Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford \u2013 National Portrait Gallery|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlong with his political interests in his last years, Walpole enjoyed the pleasures of the hunt.

The Tories became a minor, insignificant faction, and the Whigs became a dominant and largely unopposed party. His influence on the development of the uncodified [[constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution of Great Britain]] was less momentous even though he is regarded as Great Britain's first Prime Minister.<ref name=\":1\" /> He relied primarily on the favour of the King rather than on the support of the House of Commons. His power stemmed from his personal influence instead of the influence of his office. Most of his immediate successors were, comparatively speaking, extremely weak; it would take several decades more for the premiership to develop into the most powerful and most important office in the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWalpole's strategy of keeping Great Britain at peace contributed greatly to the country's prosperity. Walpole also managed to secure the position of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian Dynasty]], and effectively countervailed Jacobitism. The Jacobite threat ended, soon after Walpole's term ended, with the defeat of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|rebellion of 1745]].

He was not, as the Jacobites and discontented Whigs of his time have represented him, and as ill-informed people still represent him, a prodigal and corrupt minister. They charged him in their libels and seditious conversations as having first reduced corruption to a system. Such was their cant. But he was far from governing by corruption. He governed by party attachments. The charge of systematic corruption is less applicable to him, perhaps, than to any minister who ever served the crown for so great a length of time. He gained over very few from the Opposition. Without being a genius of the first class, he was an intelligent, prudent, and safe minister. He loved peace; and he helped to communicate the same disposition to nations at least as warlike and restless as that in which he had the chief direction of affairs. ... With many virtues, public and private, he had his faults; but his faults were superficial. A careless, coarse, and over familiar style of discourse, without sufficient regard to persons or occasions, and an almost total want of political decorum, were the errours by which he was most hurt in the public opinion: and those through which his enemies obtained the greatest advantage over him. But justice must be done. The prudence, steadiness, and vigilance of that man, joined to the greatest possible lenity in his character and his politics, preserved the crown to this royal family; and with it, their laws and liberties to this country.<ref>{{citation |last=Burke |first=Edmund |title=An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs |publisher=The Library of Liberal Arts |year=1962|pages=62\u201363}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] expressed scepticism as to whether \"an impartial Character of Sr Robert Walpole, will or can be transmitted to Posterity, for he governed this Kingdom so long that the various passions of Mankind mingled, and in a manner incorporated themselves, with every thing that was said or writt concerning him.

For he laughed at and ridiculed all notions of Publick virtue, and the love of one's Country, calling them the ''Chimerical school boy flights of Classical learning''; declaring himself at the same time, ''No Saint, no Spartan, no reformer''. He would frequently ask young fellows at their first appearance in the world, while their honest hearts were yet untainted, ''well are you to be an old Roman? a Patriot? you will soon come off of that, and grow wiser''. And thus he was more dangerous to the morals, than to the libertys of his country, to which I am persuaded that he meaned no ill in his heart. ...

As a teenager, Platt worked at a confectionery shop in [[Surrey]] before travelling to [[New Zealand]] at the age of 19 after what was rumoured to be a broken romance.  Platt remained in New Zealand until 1927 when she moved to Australia to live in [[Sydney]].<ref name=\"adb\"/> There she worked at a cinema in the city and lived in a boarding house on Darlinghurst Road in [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] where accounts tell she entertained young, attractive men. Platt was a heavy drinker and a [[Jazz Age]] party-goer who had difficulty adjusting to stability. Her marriage to Italian-born Antonio Agostini (1903-1969), in a Sydney registry office during 1930, was the beginning of an unhappy time that would see the couple leave for [[Melbourne]] to remove her from the influence of her Sydney friends.\n\n==Discovery and initial investigation==\nAgostini disappeared from friends and family in late August 1934, around a week before the unidentified Pyjama Girl was found in Splitter's Creek, near [[Albury]], on the [[New South Wales]] side of the border with [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\nThe victim's body was discovered by a local man named Tom Griffith. Griffith had been leading a prize bull along the side of Howlong Road near Albury when he saw the body in a [[culvert]] running under the road and noticed a strong smell of kerosene. Slightly concealed by a hessian grain sack and badly burnt, the body would not have been visible to anybody driving by.\n\nThe victim's head was wrapped in a towel. She had been badly beaten and an x-ray revealed a bullet in her neck. In a detail that came to define the case, she was wearing yellow silk pyjamas with a Chinese dragon motif \u2013 in [[Great Depression in Australia|Depression-era Australia]], such clothing was luxurious, youthful and bohemian.<ref name=\"AustScreenOnline\"/>\n\nIt soon became apparent that the body was of a petite woman in her twenties, but her identity could not be established. After the initial investigation failed to identify her, the body was taken to [[Sydney]] where it was put on public exhibition. She was preserved in a bath of [[formalin]] for this purpose at the Sydney University Medical School, until 1942, when her body was transferred to police headquarters where it remained until 1944.<ref name=\"random-house\"/>\n\nSeveral names were suggested for the identity of the dead woman, among them Anna Philomena Morgan and Linda Agostini. Both women were missing, both bore a likeness to the Pyjama Girl and both were of the right age. However, New South Wales police satisfied themselves that neither of the missing women was the Pyjama Girl and she remained unidentified.<ref name=\"daily-telegraph-2015\"/>\n\n==Reopening of the case==\nIn 1944, ten years after the body had been discovered, the forensic evidence was re-examined and the [[Forensic dentistry|dental analysis]] of the victim was matched to Agostini.<ref name=\"adb\"/>\n\nTony Agostini had recently returned to Sydney after being held in internment camps at [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]] and [[Loveday, South Australia|Loveday]] from 1940 to 1944 due to his nationalist sympathies. The [[police commissioner]], William MacKay, who had known him before the war when he worked as a waiter at the restaurant that MacKay frequented, interviewed him. Noticing that he seemed to be in a nervous state, MacKay asked him what had come over him. Antonio Agostini then confessed to killing his wife.\n\nIn his statement, he admitted that he had accidentally shot and killed his wife when they were living in Melbourne. Worried that he might be accused of murder, he had driven the body over the state border to Albury and had dumped it in the culvert. He had poured [[petrol]] over the body and set fire to it, to destroy the evidence.<ref name=\"adb\"/>\n\nThe identification came just as public confidence in the New South Wales Police Force began to wane at their failure to catch the decade's most prolific killer. The circumstances under which Antonio Agostini \"confessed\" to killing his wife in their Melbourne townhouse are still very dubious today.\n\nThe arrest of Agostini was a sensation, as it meant that the Pyjama Girl had been identified. He was charged with murder and was extradited to Melbourne, where he was tried for murder. He was acquitted but was found guilty of manslaughter instead, and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He was released in 1948 and deported to [[Italy]], where he died in 1969.\n\n==New evidence==\nThe case might have been left there, but some cast doubt on its conclusion. In his 2004 book, ''The Pyjama Girl Mystery: A True Story of Murder, Obsession and Lies'', historian Richard Evans pointed out discrepancies with the evidence, calling Antonio Agostini's conviction the result of \"police corruption and a miscarriage of justice\".<ref=\"evans-2004\"/> The Pyjama Girl had brown eyes; Agostini's were blue. The victim had a different bust size to Agostini and she had a different shaped nose. Evans also points out that 125 women were originally on the police's list of possible identities, but that these other leads remained \"uneliminated and untraced\".<ref name=\"AHN\"/>\n\nEvans also suggests that Agostini was murdered around the same time as the Albury victim, and most likely in the confines of the couple's Melbourne townhouse, but that she was not the Pyjama Girl.<ref name=\"AHN\"/>\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe case was turned into a short film, ''[[The Pyjama Girl Murder Case]]'' in 1939 by director [[Rupert Kathner]].\n\nA film entitled ''[[La ragazza dal pigiama giallo]]'' (''The Pyjama Girl Case''), directed by Italian [[Flavio Mogherini]], was produced in 1977.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> A book written by [[Hugh Atkinson (novelist)|Hugh Geddes]], based on the film and bearing the same title, appeared in 1978.<ref name=\"geddes-1978\"/>\n\nA short film by Canberra film maker Huck Tyrrell, entitled ''Roadside'', was produced in 1998 and inspired by the murder. In the film the victim returns as a hitch-hiker who tells her story to the unsuspecting driver and eventually leads him to her remains.\n\nIn 2013, the [[HotHouse Theatre|Hothouse Theatre]] in Albury/Wodonga commissioned a play entitled ''The Pyjama Girl'' from Canberra playwright Emma Gibson which it performed.<ref name=\"hothouse\"/>\n\n==See also== \n* [[List of solved missing persons cases]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"adb\">{{Citation  | first=Bruce   | last=Pennay   | title =Agostini, Linda (1905 - 1934)    | publisher =[[Australian National University]]  | work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]  | url =http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130703b.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-02}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AustScreenOnline\">{{cite AV media| medium=Motion Picture| title=Australia Today \u2013 The Pyjama Girl Murder Case| year=1939| url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/australia-today-pyjama-girl/clip1/| publisher=[[Australian Screen Online]]}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"random-house\">{{cite book| title='Pyjama girl' murderer sentenced| work=Australia Through Time| edition=7th| publisher=Random House Australia| year=1999| isbn=978-0091838157}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"daily-telegraph-2015\">{{cite news| title=The Pyjama Girl murder| work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]| date=5 November 2015| url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/special-features/the-pyjama-girl-murder/story-fnknbqfy-1227591025452|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n<ref=\"evans-2004\">Evans, Richard (2004).
