At the time, Lissa was a famous center of Torah studies, and Mecklenburg began [[Torah study|studying Torah]] as a student of the local ''Rav'', [[Zechariah Mendel]], a friend and correspondent of Rabbi [[Akiva Eger]].

Mecklenburg initially thereafter went into business. In 1831, at the age of 46, following commercial difficulties, he decided to quit business and was offered the rabbinical position in the city of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], [[East Prussia]]. At that time, Koenigsburg Jews were under the increasing influence of the [[Haskalah]], a reform movement, which Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg strongly opposed.<ref name=\"tzvi\"/> Together with the [[Malbim]], he publicly opposed [[Reform Judaism]]'s 1844 [[Braunschweig]]  [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_16262.html convention]. In the same period, he wrote ''Haketav VehaKabbalah'', his own commentary to the Torah.\n\nHe served as Rabbi in K\u00f6nigsberg, for the rest of his life, for 34 years (1831\u201365). Before his death, he ordered that no [[hesped|eulogies]] be given at his funeral. In his will, he requested that ''Haketav Vehakabbalah'' be read after the public [[Torah reading]], during the [[shloshim|first 30 days of mourning]].<ref name=\"tzvi\"/>\n\nIn the opinion of others, Rabbi Yaakov Tzvi studied directly under Rabbi Akiva Eiger.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} He mentions in his ''Haketav Vehakabbaleh'' Rabbi A.

He announced the promotion's formation at John Arezzi's ''Wrestling Fans Fantasy Weekend'' convention in August 1990. Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 134.</ref> The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Paul Orndorff]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Ivan Koloff]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick.

[[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Albano]] were hired as commentators.\n\nThe promotion held a taping in [[New York City]] at the [[New York Penta]] in January 1991 that was plagued with legal issues.

''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 149.</ref> Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]].<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 156.</ref> The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 163.</ref>\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992 that aired on [[Prime Ticket]] as ''Thunder Hour'', a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993 that was never aired, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> [[ESPN2]] aired old episodes of ''Fury Hour'' and ''Thunder Hour'' in 1995, albeit in heavily edited form. Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|executive_producer = Lenny Duge\n|starring = See [[List of former Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) personnel|UWF alumni]]\n|country = United States\n|location = [[Reseda Country Club]] <small>(1990)</small><br>[[New York Penta]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Universal Studios Florida]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[War Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1992)</small>\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]] <small>(1990-1991)</small><br>[[Prime Ticket]] <small>(1992)</small><br>[[ESPN2]] <small>(1995)</small>\n|first_aired = October 1, 1990\n|last_aired = July 26, 1992\n|num_episodes = 69\n|list_episodes = List of UWF Fury Hour episodes\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year television deal with [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990, and aired on Monday nights as part of the network's ''Feet, Fists and Fury'' programming block that also included [[kickboxing]] and [[boxing]].<ref>https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/90-OCR/BC-1990-09-17-OCR-Page-0043.pdf</ref>\n\nA [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] occurred during a semifinal [[UWF Beach Brawl#SportsChannel Television Championship tournament brackets|SportsChannel Television Championship Tournament]] match between Steve Ray and [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] in May 1991.

Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 134.</ref> The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Paul Orndorff]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Ivan Koloff]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.184)</ref> The top homegrown talent included \"Wild Thing\" Steve Ray and \"Cutie Pie\" [[Louie Spicolli]]. [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Albano]] were hired as commentators.\n\nThe promotion held a taping in [[New York City]] at the [[New York Penta]] in January 1991 that was plagued with legal issues. The World Wrestling Federation sent cease and desist orders after [[The Honky Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]] and [[Rick Rude]] appeared on-camera.<ref name=02041991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/feb-4-1991-observer-newsletter-pivotal-week-life-dave-meltzer-89881|title=February 4, 1991 Observer Newsletter: Pivotal week in the life of Dave Meltzer|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=February 4, 1991|accessdate=September 7, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Both had recently walked out of the WWF but were still under contract to the company. Honky Tonk Man would later explain that the check he received from Abrams for this taping bounced, and he filed a formal complaint with the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] to get reimbursed.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r6kIfzFSSM</ref>\n\nAbrams hired Howard Brody, the owner of [[Ladies Major League Wrestling]], to help him expand UWF into the Florida market in mid-1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 149.</ref> Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]].<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 156.</ref> The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 163.</ref>\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992 that aired on [[Prime Ticket]] as ''Thunder Hour'', a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993 that was never aired, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> [[ESPN2]] aired old episodes of ''Fury Hour'' and ''Thunder Hour'' in 1995, albeit in heavily edited form. Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|executive_producer = Lenny Duge\n|starring = See [[List of former Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) personnel|UWF alumni]]\n|country = United States\n|location = [[Reseda Country Club]] <small>(1990)</small><br>[[New York Penta]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Universal Studios Florida]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[War Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1992)</small>\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]] <small>(1990-1991)</small><br>[[Prime Ticket]] <small>(1992)</small><br>[[ESPN2]] <small>(1995)</small>\n|first_aired = October 1, 1990\n|last_aired = July 26, 1992\n|num_episodes = 69\n|list_episodes = List of UWF Fury Hour episodes\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year television deal with [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990, and aired on Monday nights as part of the network's ''Feet, Fists and Fury'' programming block that also included [[kickboxing]] and [[boxing]].<ref>https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/90-OCR/BC-1990-09-17-OCR-Page-0043.pdf</ref>\n\nA famous [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] occurred during a semifinal [[UWF Beach Brawl#SportsChannel Television Championship tournament brackets|SportsChannel Television Championship Tournament]] match between Steve Ray and [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] in May 1991. Allegedly, [[Herb Abrams]] thought Ray was sleeping with his wife and paid Williams extra money to rough Ray up during the bout. Ray would claim years later that this was a [[worked shoot]] and both competitors had agreed to work stiff with each other prior to the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nAbrams signed a deal with [[Prime Ticket]] in June 1992 for the production and broadcast of new content.<ref>Meltzer, Dave.

July 6, 1992, p. 14.</ref> New episodes taped at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] aired as '''''Thunder Hour''''' on Sunday nights, and ''Fury Hour'' reruns began airing on Saturday mornings.\n\nIn March 1995, existing ''Fury Hour'' and ''Thunder Hour'' episodes were repackaged to a half-hour format and aired daily on [[ESPN2]]. Those same 24 repackaged episodes later re-aired on [[ESPN Classic]] in 2008 and 2009.<ref>[http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/index_topic/topic/10301 411mania \u00bb Wrestling \u00bb TV Reports] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922193027/http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/index_topic/topic/10301 |date=September 22, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/espnclassic.htm|title=UWF - ESPN Classic|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>Steve Ray tried suing ESPN Classic in 2014 for using his likeness during these rebroadcasts, but was unsuccessful.<ref>https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2015/04/espn-win-in-wrestling-footage-case-upheld-on-appeal-592704/</ref>\n\n[[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]] reran original one-hour format episodes of ''Fury Hour'' in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/01/21/320155.html|title=ESPN Classics Canada won't go Raw|publisher=SLAM Wrestling|date=January 21, 2004}}</ref>\n\n===Commentators===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Commentators\n!Tenure\n|-\n|[[Herb Abrams]] and [[Bruno Sammartino]]\n|September 24, 1990 - November 11, 1990\n|-\n|[[Craig Minervini|Craig DeGeorge]] and [[Bruno Sammartino]]\n|December 6, 1990 - July 20, 1991\n|-\n|Craig DeGeorge and [[Lou Albano]] \n|April 7, 1991\n|-\n|Craig DeGeorge and [[John Tolos]] \n|June 19, 1992\n|-\n|Carlo Gianelli and John Tolos\n|July 24, 1993 - September 23, 1994\n|-\n|}\n\n===Commissioners===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1993, the UWF released six volumes of [[PAL]] videos in Germany through Summit International Pictures under the \"Wrestling Super Champs\" banner. They were all compilations of Fury Hour matches. The same six \"Wrestling Super Champs\" volumes were re-released in Germany through J\u00fcnger Verlag under the \"Super Wrestling\" banner.\n\nRecent years have seen the emergence of UWF [[DVD]]s in Australia through Payless Entertainment. Each of the seven [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] DVDs contains one episode of ''Fury Hour''. The DVDs include ''Body Slammin'', ''Grand Slam'', ''Grudge Matches'', ''It's War'', ''Tag Team Madness'', ''The Main Event'', and ''Wrestling Wars''. In Germany, a [[DVD region code|Region 0]] DVD titled \"Wrestling Super 4 Champs\" was released containing two episodes of ''Fury Hour''.

In the late 19th and early 20th century most major denominations started overseas missionary activity.  The \"[[Mainline Protestant]]\" denominations promoted the \"[[Social Gospel]]\" in the early 20th century, calling on Americans to reform their society; the demand for [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of liquor]] was especially strong. After 1970, the mainline denominations (such as Methodists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians) lost membership and influence. The more conservative [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], and [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] denominations (such as the Southern Baptists) grew rapidly until the 1990s and helped form the [[Christian right|Religious Right]] in politics. The nation had a Catholic population from its founding, and as it expanded into areas that had been part of the Spanish and French empires, that population increased substantially.  Immigration from Catholic countries increased Catholic diversity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Catholic Church has been the largest religious organization in the United States since at least the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nAs Western Europe secularized in the late 20th century, the Americans largely resisted the trend, so that by the 21st century the US was one of the most strongly Christian of all major nations. Religiously based moral positions on issues such as abortion and homosexuality played a hotly debated [[religion and politics in the United States|role in American politics]].\n\n==Demographics==\nThe [[U.S. census]] has never asked Americans directly about their religion  or religious beliefs, but it did compile statistics from each denomination starting in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/religion.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508145129/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/religion.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=1999-05-08 |title=Religion - Publications - US Census Bureau |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2012-09-17 }}</ref>\n\nFinke and Stark conducted a statistical analysis of the official census data  after 1850, and Atlas for 1776, to estimate the number of Americans who were adherents to a specific denomination.

The percentage of Catholics in the United States increased from 1948 all the way to the 1980s, but then began declining again. The percentage of Jews in the United States has decreased from 4% to 2% during this same time period. There has been very little Jewish immigration to the US after 1948 in comparison to previous years.

Traditional Native American ceremonial ways can vary widely, and are based on the differing histories and beliefs of individual tribes, clans and bands. Early European explorers describe individual [[tribe (Native American)|Native American tribes]] and even small bands as each having their own religious practices. Theology may be [[Monotheism|monotheistic]], [[Polytheism|polytheistic]], [[Henotheism|henotheistic]], [[Animism|animistic]], or some combination thereof. Traditional beliefs are usually passed down in the forms of oral histories, stories, allegories and principles, and rely on face to face teaching in one's family and community.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u00c5ke Hultkrantz|title=The Religions of the American Indians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zo9nzMQLBEIC|year=1981|publisher=University of California Press|pages=1\u2013156|isbn=9780520042391}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ten-sq\u00faat-a-way.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Tenskwatawa, by [[George Catlin]].]]\n\nFrom time to time important religious leaders organized revivals.

Their position was opposed by the ruling class by the 1620s, which insisted that the Puritans conform to Anglican religious practices. Puritans in England were threatened as England verged on civil war.\n\nBeginning in 1630 and for the decade as many as 20,000 Puritans emigrated to America from England. Most settled in New England, but some went as far as the West Indies. Some went back to England during the English Civil War 1642-1646 and the Commonwealth.  Theologically, the Puritans were \"non-separating [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].\" Unlike the Pilgrims, who came to Massachusetts in 1620, the Puritans believed that the Church of England was a true church, though in need of major reforms. Every New England Congregational church was considered an independent entity, beholden to no hierarchy. There were no bishops. The membership was composed, at least initially, of men and women who had undergone a conversion experience and could prove it to other members.\n\n===Persecution in America===\n[[Image:Roger Williams statue by Franklin Simmons.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] was expelled from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1636 for advocating [[religious liberty]].]]\nAlthough they were victims of religious persecution in Europe, the Puritans supported the theory that sanctioned it: the need for uniformity of religion in the state.\n\nOnce in control in New England, they sought to break \"the very neck of Schism and vile opinions.\" The \"business\" of the first settlers, a Puritan minister recalled in 1681, \"was not Toleration, but [they] were professed enemies of it.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings|page=185|author=Thomas Herbert Johnson}}</ref> Puritans expelled dissenters from their colonies, a fate that in 1636 befell Roger Williams and in 1638 [[Anne Hutchinson]], America's first major female religious leader.\n\nThose who defied the Puritans by persistently returning to their jurisdictions risked [[capital punishment]], a penalty imposed on the [[Boston martyrs]], four [[Quaker]]s, between 1659 and 1661. Reflecting on the 17th century's intolerance, Thomas Jefferson was unwilling to concede to Virginians any moral superiority to the Puritans. Beginning in 1659, Virginia enacted anti-Quaker laws, including the death penalty for refractory Quakers. Jefferson surmised that \"if no capital execution took place here, as did in New England, it was not owing to the moderation of the church, or the spirit of the legislature.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_s5t3 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_s5t3/page/365 365] |title=A brief guide to beliefs: ideas, theologies, mysteries, and movements |last=Edwards |first=Linda |location=Westminster|publisher= John Knox Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-664-22259-8}}</ref>\n\n====Founding of Rhode Island====\nExpelled from Massachusetts in the winter in 1636, former Puritan leader Roger Williams issued an impassioned plea for freedom of conscience.

Jones formulated the first theory of the origins and essence of Quakerism as fundamentally \"mystical\" in his introduction to William Braithwaite's history of Quakerism [Jones based his introduction on an earlier exploration of the history of Christian mysticism, Studies in Mystical Religion, one of a handful of pioneering works in that  field in The early Twentieth century (1909). A few years later he expanded his study with Spiritual Reformers of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (1914)] (Braithwaite, 1912). ln 1921, he emphatically reaffirmed his thesis: \"No other large, organized, historically continuous body of Christians has yet existed which has been so fundamentally mystical, both in theory and practice, as the Society of Friends ... \" (Jones, 190 I, xiii). For over 25 years, Jones' claim seemed too accurate to question. But in 1955 a major shift in Quaker studies occurred when Hugh L. Doncaster claimed that new scholarship viewed Quakerism in another light. [See L. Hugh Doncaster, \"Forward to the Second Edition,\" in Wm. C. Braithwaite's The Beginnings of Quakerism, ed. Henry J. Cadbury (1955).] The paradigm shift had been set in motion with the publication of Geoffrey F. Nuttall's work, The Holy Spirit in Puritan Faith and Experience, in 1946 (revised 1992). Nuttall, a non-Quaker historian, supplanted .Jones' mystical theory with a new theory of Quakers as radical Puritans. According to NuttalI, George Fox and the Quakers, \"... who in the exclusive sense are not puritans but the puritans' fiercest foes, ... repeat, extend, and fuse so much of what is held by the radical, Separatist party within Puritanism, that they cannot be denied the name or excluded from consideration.\"}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/holyspiritinpuri0000nutt|url-access=registration|title=The Holy Spirit in Puritan Faith and Experience|last=Nuttall|first=Geoffrey F.|date=1992-07-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226609416|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/holyspiritinpuri0000nutt/page/13 13]|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Durnbaugh|first=Donald F.|date=2012-04-04|title=Baptists and Quakers\u2014Left Wing Puritans?|journal=Quaker History|volume=62|issue=2|pages=67\u201382|doi=10.1353/qkh.1973.0005|issn=1934-1504}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horle|first=Craig W.|date=1976-01-01|title=Quakers and Baptists 1647\u20131660|journal=Baptist Quarterly|volume=26|issue=8|pages=344\u2013362|doi=10.1080/0005576X.1976.11751464|issn=0005-576X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maclear|first=James F.|date=1950-12-01|title=Quakerism and the end of the Interregnum: a Chapter in the Domestication of Radical Puritanism|journal=Church History|volume=19|issue=4|pages=240\u2013270|doi=10.2307/3161160|issn=1755-2613|jstor=3161160}}</ref> Historians in support of the Puritan classification of Quakers notice that Quakers stretch the sober deportment of the Puritans into a glorification of \"plainness.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p0jndZXU-34C&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=sober+deportment+of+the+Puritans+into+a+glorification+of+%22plainness.%22#v=onepage&q=sober%20deportment%20of%20the%20Puritans%20into%20a%20glorification%20of%20%22plainness.%22&f=false|title=America on the Cusp of God's Grace: The Biblical Connection to the Stars and Stripes|last=Hurst|first=Dennis G.|date=2010-11-12|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781450269551|location=|pages=14|language=en|quote=They stretched the sober deportment of the Puritans into a glorification of \"plainness.\" Theologically, they expanded the Puritan concept of a church of individuals ...}}</ref> Theologically, they expanded the Puritan concept of a church of individuals regenerated by the [[Holy Spirit]] to the idea of the indwelling of the Spirit or the \"Light of Christ\" in every person.\n\nSuch teaching struck many of the Quakers' contemporaries as dangerous [[heresy]]. Quakers were severely persecuted in England for daring to deviate so far from orthodox Christianity. By 1680, 10,000 Quakers had been imprisoned in England and 243 had died of torture and mistreatment in jail.\n\nThis reign of terror impelled Friends to seek refuge in Rhode Island in the 1670s, where they soon became well entrenched. In 1681, when Quaker leader [[William Penn]] parlayed a debt owed by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to his father into a charter for the province of [[Pennsylvania]], many more Quakers were prepared to grasp the opportunity to live in a land where they might worship freely. By 1685, as many as 8,000 Quakers had come to Pennsylvania from England, Wales, and Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Although the Quakers may have resembled the Puritans in some religious beliefs and practices, they differed with them over the necessity of compelling [[religious uniformity]] in society.\n\n===Pennsylvania Germans===\nDuring the main years of German emigration to Pennsylvania in the mid-18th century, most of the emigrants were Lutherans, Reformed, or members of small sects\u2014[[Mennonite]]s, [[Amish]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Dunkers]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] and [[Schwenkfelders]]. The great majority became farmers.<ref>Joseph E.

His son [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]], was a Catholic who inherited the grant for Maryland from his father and was in charge 1630\u201345. In 1634, Lord Baltimore's two ships, the ''Ark'' and the ''Dove'', sailed with the first 200 settlers to Maryland. They included two Catholic priests. Lord Baltimore assumed that religion was a private matter. He rejected the need for an established church, guaranteed liberty of conscience to all Christians, and embraced pluralism.<ref>John D.

After the [[Glorious Revolution of 1689]] in England, the Church of England was legally established in the colony and English penal laws, which deprived Catholics of the right to vote, hold office, or worship publicly, were enforced.

The Church of England was legally established; the bishop of London who had oversight of Anglican in the colonies made it a favorite missionary target and sent in 22 clergymen (in priestly orders) by 1624.  In practice, establishment meant that local taxes were funneled through the local parish to handle the needs of local government, such as roads and poor relief, in addition to the salary of the minister.  There was never a bishop in colonial Virginia, and in practice the local vestry consisted of laymen who controlled the parish and handled local taxes, roads and poor relief.<ref>Edward L.

Some ministers solved their problems by encouraging parishioners to become devout at home, using the ''Book of Common Prayer'' for private prayer and devotion (rather than the Bible). This allowed devout Anglicans to lead an active and sincere religious life apart from the unsatisfactory formal church services. However, the stress on private devotion weakened the need for a bishop or a large institutional church of the sort Blair wanted. The stress on personal piety opened the way for the [[First Great Awakening]], which pulled people away from the established church.<ref>Edward L.

It resulted from powerful preaching that deeply affected listeners (already church members) with a deep sense of personal guilt and salvation by Christ.  Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made relationship with God intensely personal to the average person by creating a deep sense of spiritual guilt, forgiveness, redemption and peace. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom sees it as part of a \"great international Protestant upheaval\" that also created [[Pietism]] in Germany, the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Revival]] and [[Methodism]] in England.<ref>Sydney E. Armstrong, ''A Religious History of the American People''. (1972) p. 263</ref> It brought Christianity to the slaves and was an apocalyptic event in [[New England]] that challenged established church authority. It resulted in division between the new revivalists and the old traditionalists who insisted on ritual and doctrine.\nThe new style of sermons and the way people practiced their faith breathed new life into Christian faith in America. People became passionately and emotionally involved in their relationship with God, rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse in a detached manner. Ministers who used this new style of preaching were generally called \"new lights\", while the preachers of old were called \"old lights\". People began to study the [[Bible]] at home, which effectively decentralized the means of informing the public on religious manners and was akin to the individualistic trends present in Europe during the [[Protestant Reformation]].<ref name=\"Thomas S. Kidd 2007\"/>\n\nThe fundamental premise of evangelicalism is the conversion of individuals from a state of sin to a \"[[Born again Christianity|new birth]]\" through preaching of the Bible leading to [[Salvation by faith|faith]]. The First Great Awakening led to changes in American colonial society. In New England, the Great Awakening was influential among many [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].  In the Middle and Southern colonies, especially in the \"Backcountry\" regions, the Awakening was influential among [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]. In the South [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist]] preachers converted both whites and enslaved blacks.<ref>Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)</ref>\n\nDuring the first decades of the 18th century, in the [[Connecticut River Valley]], a series of local \"awakenings\" began in the Congregational church with ministers including [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]. The first new Congregational Church in the Massachusetts Colony during the great awakening period, was in 1731 at [[Uxbridge, MA|Uxbridge]] and called the Rev. [[Nathan Webb]] as its Pastor. By the 1730s, they had spread into what was interpreted as a general outpouring of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Spirit]] that bathed the American colonies, England, Wales, and Scotland.\n\nIn mass open-air revivals powerful preachers like [[George Whitefield]] brought thousands of souls to the [[Born again (Christianity)|new birth]]. The Great Awakening, which had spent its force in New England by the mid-1740s, split the Congregational and Presbyterian churches into supporters\u2014called \"[[New Lights]]\" and \"[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Side]]\"\u2014and opponents\u2014the \"Old Lights\" and \"Old Side.\" Many New England New Lights became [[Separate Baptists]]. Largely through the efforts of a charismatic preacher from New England named [[Shubal Stearns]] and paralleled by the New Side Presbyterians (who were eventually reunited on their own terms with the Old Side), they carried the Great Awakening into the southern colonies, igniting a series of the revivals that lasted well into the 19th century.<ref name=\"LOC Religion 18th century\"/>\n\nThe supporters of the Awakening and its evangelical thrust\u2014[[Presbyterian]]s, Baptists and [[Methodist]]s\u2014became the largest American Protestant denominations by the first decades of the 19th century. Opponents of the Awakening or those split by it\u2014Anglicans, Quakers, and Congregationalists\u2014were left behind.\n\nUnlike the [[Second Great Awakening]] that began about 1800 and which reached out to the unchurched, the First Great Awakening focused on people who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety, and their self-awareness.<ref name=\"Thomas S. Kidd 2007\">Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2007)</ref>\n\n===Evangelicals in the South===\nThe South had originally been settled and controlled by Anglicans, who dominated the ranks of rich planters but whose ritualistic high church established religion had little appeal to ordinary men and women, both white and black.<ref>Jewel L.

Baptist services emphasized emotion; the only ritual,  baptism, involved immersion (not sprinkling as in the Anglican tradition) of adults only. Opposed to the low moral standards prevalent around them, the Baptists strictly enforced their own high standards of personal morality, and especially opposed sexual misconduct, heavy drinking, frivolous spending, missing services, cursing, and revelry.  Church trials took place frequently, and Baptist churches expelled members who did not submit to discipline.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Spangler\n| first1                = Jewel L.\n| title                 = Virginians Reborn: Anglican Monopoly, Evangelical Dissent, and the Rise of the Baptists in the Late Eighteenth Century\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=R0RVN0vx50gC\n| location              = Charlottesville\n| publisher             = University of Virginia Press\n| date      = 2008\n| page                  = \n| isbn                  = 9780813926797\n}}\n</ref>\n\nMany historians have debated the implications of the religious rivalries for the coming of the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u20131783.<ref>Bonomi, ''Under the Cope of Heaven: Religion, Society, and Politics in Colonial America'' (1988) pp. 187\u2013222 and 269\u201378, cites over forty scholars.</ref>  The Baptist farmers did introduce a new egalitarian ethic that largely displaced the semi-aristocratic ethic of the Anglican planters. However, both groups supported the Revolution.  There was a sharp contrast between the austerity of the plain-living Baptists and the opulence of the Anglican planters, who controlled local government. Baptist church discipline, mistaken by the gentry for radicalism, served to ameliorate disorder. The struggle for religious toleration erupted and played out during the [[American Revolution]], as the Baptists worked to disestablish the Anglican church.<ref>Rhys Isaac, \"Evangelical Revolt: The Nature of the Baptists' Challenge to the Traditional Order in Virginia, 1765 to 1775,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 1974 31(3): 345\u2013368</ref>\n\nBaptists, [[German American|German Lutherans]] and Presbyterians funded their own ministers, and favored disestablishment of the Anglican church.\n\n====Methodists====\nMethodist missionaries were also active in the late colonial period. From 1776 to 1815 Methodist Bishop [[Francis Asbury]] made 42 trips into the western parts to visit Methodist congregations. In the 1780s itinerant Methodist preachers carried copies of an anti-slavery petition in their saddlebags throughout the state, calling for an end to slavery. At the same time, counter-petitions were circulated. The petitions were presented to the Assembly; they were debated, but no legislative action was taken, and after 1800 there was less and less religious opposition to slavery.<ref>Richard K. MacMaster, \"Liberty or Property? The Methodist Petition for Emancipation in Virginia, 1785,\" ''Methodist History,'' Oct 1971, Vol. 10 Issue 1, pp. 44\u201355</ref>\n\n====Masculinity and morality====\nEspecially in the Southern back country, most families had no religious affiliation whatsoever and their low moral standards were shocking to proper Englishmen.<ref name=\"Charles Woodmason 1969\"/>  The Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians and other evangelicals directly challenged these lax moral standards and refused to tolerate them in their ranks. The evangelicals identified as sinful the traditional standards of masculinity which revolved around gambling, drinking, and brawling, and arbitrary control over women, children, and slaves. The religious communities enforced new standards, creating a new male leadership role that followed Christian principles and became dominant in the 19th century.<ref name=\"Janet Moore Lindman 2000, pp 393-416\"/>\n\n==American Revolution==\n[[File:RichmondVA StJohnsChurch.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[St. John's Episcopal Church (Richmond, Virginia)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] is the oldest church in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and the site of the [[Second Virginia Convention]] where [[Patrick Henry]] delivered his \"[[Give me liberty or give me death]]\" speech.]]\n\nThe Revolution split some denominations, notably the Church of England, whose clergy (priests often referred to as 'ministers') were bound by oath to support the king, and the Quakers, who were traditionally [[pacifism|pacifist]]s. Religious practice suffered in certain places because of the absence of ministers and the destruction of churches.\n\n===Church of England===\n{{main article|Episcopal Church (United States)}}\nThe American Revolution inflicted deeper wounds on the [[Church of England]] in America than on any other denomination because the [[English monarch]] was the head of the church. Church of England priests, at their ordination, swore allegiance to the [[British crown]].\n\nThe [[Book of Common Prayer]] offered prayers for the monarch, beseeching God \"to be his defender and keeper, giving him victory over all his enemies,\" who in 1776 were American soldiers as well as friends and neighbors of American parishioners of the Church of England. Loyalty to the church and to its head could be construed as treason to the American cause.\n\nPatriotic American members of the Church of England, loathing to discard so fundamental a component of their faith as The Book of Common Prayer, revised it to conform to the political realities.  After the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] in which Great Britain  formally recognized American independence, Anglicans were left without leadership or a formal institution. Samuel Seabury was consecrated bishop by the Scottish Episcopal Church in 1784. He resided in New York. After the requirement to take an Oath of Allegiance to the Crown two Americans were consecrated bishops in London in 1786 for Virginia and Pennsylvania. The Protestant [[Episcopal Church of the United States]] was created in 1787 as an autonomous in communion with the Church of England. It adopted a modified Book of Common Prayer which most notably used the Scottish Canon (Eucharistic Prayer). This consecration prayer moved the eucharistic doctrine of the American Church much closer to the Roman Catholic and Orthodox teachings and virtually undid Cranmer's rejection of the eucharist as a material sacrifice offered to God (which had been the accepted theology from the early 3rd century).\n\n==The new nation==\nHistorians in recent decades have debated the nature of American religiosity in the early 19th century, focusing on issues of secularism, deism, traditional religious practices, and newly emerging evangelical forms based on the [[Great Awakening]].<ref>Christopher Grasso, \"The Religious and the Secular in the Early American Republic,\" ''Journal of the Early Republic'' (Summer 2016) 36#2 pp. 359\u2013388.</ref><ref>Craig Calhoun, Mark Juergensmeyer, and Jonathan VanAntwerpen, eds. ''Rethinking Secularism'' (Oxford University Press, 2011).</ref>\n\n===Constitution===\nThe Constitution ratified in 1788 makes no mention of religion except that no religious test is allowed for office holders.  However, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], adopted in 1791, has played a central role in defining the relationship of the federal government to the free exercise of religion, and to the prohibition establishment of an official church. Its policies were extended to cover state governments in the 1940s.  The government is not allowed to hinder the free exercise of religion, and is not allowed to sponsor any particular religion through taxation of favors.<ref>James S.

The treaty was a routine diplomatic agreement but has attracted later attention because the English version included a clause about religion in the United States. \n<blockquote>As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion,\u2014as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Muslims]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>,\u2014and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Mohammedan]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Franklin T. Lambert|Frank Lambert]], Professor of History at [[Purdue University]], the assurances in Article 11 were \"intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced.  John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers.\" Lambert writes, \n:\"By their actions, the Founding Fathers made clear that their primary concern was religious freedom, not the advancement of a state religion. Individuals, not the government, would define religious faith and practice in the United States. Thus the Founders ensured that in no official sense would America be a Christian Republic. Ten years after the Constitutional Convention ended its work, the country assured the world that the United States was a secular state, and that its negotiations would adhere to the rule of law, not the dictates of the Christian faith. The assurances were contained in the Treaty of Tripoli of 1797 and were intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced. John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank Lambert|title=The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CHIomb78VgC|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12602-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4CHIomb78VgC&pg=PA11 11]}}</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding the clear separation of government and religion, the predominant cultural and social nature of the nation did become strongly Christian.  In an 1892 employment case [[Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States]] the US Supreme Court stated,\n\"These, and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation.\"\n\n== Great Awakenings and evangelicalism ==\n[[File:Growth of Denominations in America 1780 to 1860.jpg|thumb|450px|During the Second Great Awakening, the number of local churches rose sharply; total membership in the denominations (not shown) also grew.<ref>Based on data in James A.

The Methodists and Baptists were the most active at sponsoring revivals. The number of Methodist church members grew from 58,000 in 1790 to 258,000 in 1820 and 1,661,000 in 1860. Over 70 years Methodist membership grew by a factor of 28.6 times when the total national population grew by a factor of eight times.<ref>US Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States: From: the Colonial Times to the Present'' (1976) pp. 8, 392</ref>\n\nIt made [[evangelicalism]] one of the dominant forces in American religion. Balmer explains that:\n:\"Evangelicalism itself, I believe, is quintessentially North American phenomenon, deriving as it did from the confluence of Pietism, Presbyterianism, and the vestiges of Puritanism. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain \u2013 warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans \u2013 even as the North American context itself has profoundly shaped the various manifestations of evangelicalism.: fundamentalism, neo-evangelicalism, the holiness movement, Pentecostalism, the charismatic movement, and various forms of African-American and Hispanic evangelicalism.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Randall Balmer|title=The Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C&pg=PR8|year=2002|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=vii\u2013viii|isbn=9780664224097}}</ref>\n\n===Second Great Awakening===\n[[File:1839-meth.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1839 Methodist camp meeting]]\n{{main article|Second Great Awakening}}\n{{see also|Camp meeting|Revival meeting}}\n\nIn 1800, major revivals began that spread across the nation: the decorous [[Second Great Awakening]] in New England and the exuberant [[Great Revival]] in [[Cane Ridge, Kentucky|Cane Ridge]], [[Kentucky]]. The principal religious innovation produced by the Kentucky revivals was the [[camp meeting]].\n\nThe revivals at first were organized by Presbyterian ministers who modeled them after the extended outdoor [[communion seasons]], used by the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, which frequently produced emotional, demonstrative displays of religious conviction. In Kentucky, the pioneers loaded their families and provisions into their wagons and drove to the Presbyterian meetings, where they pitched tents and settled in for several days.\n\nWhen assembled in a field or at the edge of a forest for a prolonged religious meeting, the participants transformed the site into a camp meeting. The religious revivals that swept the Kentucky camp meetings were so intense and created such gusts of emotion that their original sponsors, the Presbyterians, as well the Baptists, soon repudiated them. The Methodists, however, adopted and eventually domesticated camp meetings and introduced them into the eastern states, where for decades they were one of the evangelical signatures of the denomination.\n\nThe Second Great Awakening (1800\u20131830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. The great revival quickly spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee and southern Ohio. Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. The Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on ministers known as [[circuit rider (religious)|circuit rider]]s, who sought out people in remote frontier locations. The circuit riders came from among the common people, which helped them establish rapport with the frontier families they hoped to convert.\n\nThe Second Great Awakening exercised a profound impact on American religious history.  By 1859 evangelicalism emerged as a kind of national church or national religion and was the grand absorbing theme of American religious life.  The greatest gains were made by the very well organized Methodists. [[Francis Asbury]] (1745\u20131816) led the [[United Methodist Church|American Methodist movement]] as one of the most prominent religious leaders of the young republic.  Traveling throughout the eastern seaboard, [[Methodism]] grew quickly under Asbury's leadership into the nation's largest and most widespread denomination.  The numerical strength of the Baptists and Methodists rose relative to that of the denominations dominant in the colonial period\u2014the [[Anglicans]], Presbyterians, [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]]. Efforts to apply Christian teaching to the resolution of social problems presaged the [[Social Gospel]] of the late 19th century.  It also sparked the beginnings of groups such as the [[Mormons]], the [[Restoration Movement]] and the [[Holiness movement]].\n\n===Third Great Awakening===\n{{main article|Third Great Awakening}}\nThe Third Great Awakening was a period of religious activism in American history from the late 1850s to the 20th century. It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong sense of social activism.  It gathered strength from the [[postmillennial]] theology that the [[Second Coming]] of Christ would come after mankind had reformed the entire earth.  The [[Social Gospel]] Movement gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement.  New groupings emerged, such as the [[Holiness movement]] and [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]] movements, and [[Christian Science]].<ref>Robert William Fogel, ''The Fourth Great Awakening & the Future of Egalitarianism'' (2000)</ref>\n\nThe Protestant mainline churches were growing rapidly in numbers, wealth and educational levels, throwing off their frontier beginnings and become centered in towns and cities. Intellectuals and writers such as [[Josiah Strong]] advocated a muscular Christianity with systematic outreach to the unchurched in America and around the globe.  Others built colleges and universities to train the next generation. Each denomination supported active missionary societies, and made the role of missionary one of high prestige.  The great majority of pietistic mainline Protestants (in the North) supported the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and urged it to endorse prohibition and social reforms.<ref>Paul Kleppner, ''The Third Electoral System, 1853\u20131892: Parties, Voters, and Political Cultures'' (2009)</ref><ref>Richard Jensen, ''The Winning of the Midwest'' (1971) p. 171</ref> See [[Third Party System]]\n\nThe awakening in numerous cities in 1858 was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]].

In 1787, [[Richard Allen (reverend)|Richard Allen]] and his colleagues in Philadelphia broke away from the Methodist Church and in 1815 founded the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church]], which, along with independent black Baptist congregations, flourished as the century progressed.

Changing social conditions forced a shift from the gospel of wealth to the Social Gospel. the \"[[Gospel of wealth]]\" was an appeal to rich Christians to share their wealth in philanthropy, while the Social Gospel called on ministers to take the lead themselves in eliminating social evils. The second challenge emerged from modern science, where evolutionary Darwinism generated quite different religious responses in terms of biblical authoritarianism, romantic liberalism and scientific modernism. Protestantism gradually abandoned its emphasis on individual salvation and laissez-faire individualism; although this tendency was resisted by fundamentalists who sought, often blindly, to cling to the theological foundations of Christianity to which the denominations have begun again to return.<ref>Sidney E.  Mead, \"American Protestantism since the Civil War. II. From Americanism to Christianity.\" ''Journal of Religion'' 36.2 (1956): 67-89.

According to historian R. Laurence Moore, Christian Scientists, Pentecostals, Jehovah Witnesses and Catholics responded to hostile comments by sensing themselves as persecuted Americans on the margins of society, which made them cling tightly to their status as full citizens.. <ref>R. Laurence Moore, '' Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans'' (1986)</ref>\n\n===The  South===\nHistorian [[Edward Ayers]] describes an impoverished South with a rich Spiritual life:\n: Religious faith and language appeared everywhere in the New South. It permeated public speech as well as private emotion. For many people, religion provided the measure of politics, the power behind law and reform, the reason to reach out to the poor and exploited, a pressure to cross racial boundaries. People viewed everything from courtship to child-rearing to their own deaths in religious terms. Even those filled with doubt or disdain could not escape the images, the assumptions, the power of faith.<ref> Edward Ayres, ''The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction'' (1992), p 160. </ref>\nThe Baptists formed the largest grouping, for both Blacks and whites, with its loose networks of numerous small rural churches churches.  In second place for both races came the Methodists, with a hierarchical structure at the opposite end of the spectrum from the Baptists. Smaller fundamentalist groups that grew very large in the 20th century were starting to appear. Clusters of Roman Catholics appeared in the region's few cities, as well as southern Louisiana. Elite white Southerners, for the most part, were Episcopalians or Presbyterians. Across the region, ministers held high prestige positions, especially in the black community where they were typically political leaders as well. When the great majority Blacks were disenfranchised after 1890, the black preachers were still allowed to vote. Revivals were regular occurrences, attracting large crowds. It was usually the already converted who attended, so the number of new converts was relatively small but new or old, the all enjoyed the preaching and the socializing.<ref> Edward Ayres, ''The Promise of the New South'' (1992), pp  160. </ref><ref>Kenneth K.

The goal was to apply[[Christian ethics]] to [[social issue|social problem]]s, especially issues of [[social justice]] and  [[social evil]]s such as [[economic inequality]], [[poverty]], [[alcoholism]], [[crime]], [[Ethnic conflict|racial tensions]], [[slum]]s, unclean environment, [[child labor]], lack of [[labour unions|unionization]], poor schools, and the dangers of war.  Theologically, the Social Gospelers sought to put into practice the [[Lord's Prayer]]: \"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven\".<ref>Cecelia Tichi, ''Civic Passions: Seven Who Launched Progressive America (and What They Teach Us). (2009) pp 205-239. [https://archive.org/details/civicpassionssev0000tich online]</ref> They typically were [[postmillennialism|postmillennialist]]; that is, they believed the [[Second Coming]] could not happen until humankind rid itself of [[social evil]]s by human effort. Social Gospel theologians rejected [[premillennialist]] theology, which held the [[Second Coming]] of Christ was imminent, and Christians should devote their energies to preparing for it rather than social issues. That perspective was strongest among fundamentalists and in the South. The Social Gospel was more popular among clergy than laity.  Its leaders were predominantly associated with the liberal wing of the [[progressive movement]], and most were [[Liberal Christianity|theologically liberal]]. Important leaders included [[Richard T. Ely]], [[Josiah Strong]], [[Washington Gladden]], and [[Walter Rauschenbusch]].  Many politicians came under its influence, notably [[William Jennings Bryan]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]]. The most controversial Social Gospel reform was  [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], which was highly popular in rural areas \u2013 including the South \u2013 and unpopular in the larger cities where mainline Protestantism was weak among the electorate.<ref>Christopher H.

[[William Bell Riley]] took the initiative in the 1925 [[Scopes Trial]] by bringing in famed politician [[William Jennings Bryan]] as an assistant to the local prosecutor, Bryan drew national media attention to the trial. In the half century after the Scopes Trial, fundamentalists had little success in shaping government policy, and they were generally defeated in their efforts to reshape the [[Mainline Protestant|mainline denominations]], which refused to join fundamentalist attacks on evolution. Particularly after the Scopes Trial, liberals saw a division between Christians in favor of the teaching of evolution, whom they viewed as educated and tolerant, and Christians against evolution, whom they viewed as narrow-minded, tribal, obscurantist.<ref>David Goetz, \"The Monkey Trial\".

After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar antievolution laws for their states. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study, or at least relegate it to the status of unproven theory perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than in other US areas and persisted through the Sputnik era.<ref>George E.

Handy identifies a religious depression in the United States starting around 1925, that only grew worse during the economic depression which began in 1929. The identification of Protestantism with American culture undermined the religious messages. The fundamentalist churches said over expanded and were financially troubled. The mainstream churches were well enough financed in the late 1920s, but lost their self-confidence in terms of whether their social gospel was needed in an age of prosperity, especially since the great reform of prohibition was a failure. In terms of their network of international missions, the mainstream churches realized that the missions were a success in terms of opening modern schools and hospitals but a failure in terms of conversions. The leading theorist Daniel Fleming proclaimed that the continents for Christian outreach and Christian .conquest were no longer Africa and Asia, but rather, materialism, racial injustice, war and poverty. The number of missionaries from mainstream denominations began a steep decline.  By contrast, the evangelical and fundamentalist churches--never wedded to the social gospel-- escalated their efforts worldwide with a focus on conversion.<ref>William R.

Suddenly in 1932\u201333, the mainline churches lost one of their historic functions in distributing alms to the poor, and the national government took over that role without any religious dimension.  Handy argues that the deep self-doubt the religious revivals customary in times of economic depression was absent in the 1930s.  He concludes that Great Depression marked the end of the dominance of Protestantism in American life.<ref>Robert T.

Only a minority of religious leaders, typified by [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], paid serious attention to the threats to peace posed by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, or militaristic Japan.  After Pearl Harbor in December 1941, practically all the religious denominations gave some support to the war effort, such as providing chaplains. The pacifist churches, such as the Quakers and Mennonites were small but maintained their opposition to military service. Many young members, such as [[Richard Nixon]] voluntarily joining the military. Unlike in 1917\u20131918, the positions were generally respected by the government, which set up non-combat civilian roles for [[conscientious objectors]]. Typically, church members sent their sons into the military without protest, accepted shortages and rationing as a war necessity, purchased war bonds, working munitions industries, and prayed intensely for safe return and for victory. Church leaders, however, were much more cautious while holding fast to the ideals of peace, justice and humanitarianism, and sometimes criticizing military policies such as the bombing of enemy cities. They sponsored 10,000 military chaplains, and set up special ministries in and around military bases, focused not only on soldiers but their young wives who often followed them. The mainstream Protestant churches supported the \"[[Double V campaign]]\" of the black churches to achieve victory against the enemies abroad, and victory against racism on the home front. However, there was little religious protest against the incarceration of Japanese on the West Coast or against segregation of Blacks in the services. The intense moral outrage regarding the Holocaust largely appeared after the war ended, especially after 1960. Many church leaders supported studies of postwar peace proposals, typified by [[John Foster Dulles]], a leading Protestant layman and a leading adviser to top-level Republicans. The churches promoted strong support for European relief programs, especially through the United Nations.<ref> John  P.

They preach [[American exceptionalism]], oppose liberal scholars, and emphasize the Christian identity of many Founding Fathers.  critics argue that many of these Christian founders actually supported the separation of church and state and would not support the notion that they were trying to found a Christian nation.<ref>John Fea,  \"Using the Past to 'Save' Our Nation: The Debate over Christian America.\" ''OAH Magazine of History'' 27.1 (2013): 7-11.</ref><ref>John Fea, ''Was America Founded as a Christian Nation?

United States]]''  a Supreme Court decision in 1892  Justice [[David Josiah Brewer]] used the opportunity to present his personal views on the nation's religious base and concluded it was \"a Christian nation\". He later wrote and lectured widely on the topic, stressing that \"Christian nation\" was an informal designation and not a legal standard, :\n:[In] American life, as expressed by its laws, its business, its customs, and its society, we find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth. Among other matters, note the following: the form of oath universally prevailing, concluding with an appeal to the Almighty; the custom of opening sessions of all deliberative bodies and most conventions with prayer; the prefatory words of all wills, \"In the name of God, amen\"; the laws respecting the observance of the Sabbath, with the general cessation of all secular business, and the closing of courts, legislatures, and other similar public assemblies on that day; the churches and church organizations which abound in every city, town, and hamlet; the multitude of charitable organizations existing everywhere under Christian auspices; the gigantic missionary associations, with general support, and aiming to establish Christian missions in every quarter of the globe. These, and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation....There is no dissonance in these declarations. There is a universal language pervading them all, having one meaning. They affirm and reaffirm that this is a religious nation. These are not individual sayings, declarations of private persons.

Restorationists do not usually describe themselves as \"reforming\" a Christian church continuously existing from the time of Jesus, but as ''restoring'' the Church that they believe was lost at some point. \"Restorationism\" is often used to describe the Stone-Campbell [[Restoration Movement]].

This law also revoked polygamists' right to vote, made them ineligible for jury service, and prohibited them from holding political office.  The subsequent 1887 [[Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act]] disincorporated the LDS Church and confiscated church assets. It also: required an anti-polygamy oath for prospective voters, jurors and public officials; mandated civil marriage licenses; disallowed [[spousal privilege]] to not testify in polygamy cases; disenfranchised women; replaced local judges with federally appointed judges; and removed local control of schools. After a [[Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States|1890 Supreme Court ruling]] found the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act constitutional, and with most church leadership either in hiding or imprisoned, the church released the [[1890 Manifesto]] which advised church members against entering legally prohibited marriages. Dissenters moved to Canada or [[Mormon colonies in Mexico]], or into hiding in remote areas. With the polygamy issue resolved, church leaders were pardoned or had their sentences reduced, assets were restored to the church, and Utah was eventually granted statehood in 1896. After the [[Reed Smoot hearings]] began in 1904, a [[Second Manifesto]] was issued which specified that anyone entering into or solemnizing polygamous marriages would be excommunicated, and clarified that polygamy restrictions applied everywhere, and not just in the United States.<ref>Kathleen Flake, ''The Politics of American Religious Identity: The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot, Mormon Apostle'' (2004)</ref>\n\nThanks to worldwide [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary work]], the church grew from 7.7 million members worldwide in 1989 to 14 million in 2010.<ref>{{cite book|author=Matthew Bowman|title=The Mormon People: The Making of an American Faith|publisher=Random House|url=https://archive.org/details/mormonpeoplemaki00bowm_0|url-access=registration|year=2012|page=[https://archive.org/details/mormonpeoplemaki00bowm_0/page/218 218]|isbn=9780812983364}}</ref>\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\n{{main article|History of Jehovah's Witnesses}}\n\n[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] comprise a fast-growing denomination that has kept itself separate from other Christian denominations.

Legal troubles sometimes result when they forbid medical treatment of their children.<ref>Stephen Gottschalk, ''The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life'' 1973)</ref>\n\nThe Church is unique among American denominations in several ways.  It is highly centralized, with all the local churches merely branches of the mother church in Boston. There are no ministers, but there are practitioners who are integral to the movement. The practitioners operate local businesses that help members heal their illnesses by the power of the mind. They depend for their clientele on the approval of the Church. Starting in the late 19th century the Church has rapidly lost membership, although it does not publish statistics. Its flagship newspaper ''Christian Science Monitor'' lost most of its subscribers and dropped its paper version to become an online source.<ref>Stephen Gottschalk, \"Christian Science Polity in Crisis,\" ''The Christian Century'' Volume: 110.

Originally devoted to the salvation of souls, they eventually focused on the eradication of every kind of social ill. Benevolent societies were the direct result of the extraordinary energies generated by the evangelical movement\u2014specifically, by the \"activism\" resulting from conversion. \"The evidence of God's grace,\" Presbyterian evangelist [[Charles Grandison Finney]] insisted, \"was a person's benevolence toward others.\"<ref>Dwight Burlingame, ed. ''Philanthropy in America: a comprehensive historical encyclopedia'' (2004)</ref>\n\nThe evangelical establishment used this powerful network of voluntary, ecumenical benevolent societies to Christianize the nation. The earliest and most important of these organizations focused their efforts on the conversion of sinners to the new birth or to the creation of conditions (such as sobriety sought by [[Temperance movement|temperance societies]]) in which conversions could occur. The six largest societies in 1826\u201327 were: the American Education Society, the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], the [[American Bible Society]], the [[American Sunday School Union]], the [[American Tract Society]], and the [[American Home Missionary Society]].\n\nMost denominations operated missions abroad (and some to Indians and Asians in the US).

Grant was determined to divide Native American post appointments \"up among the religious churches\"; by 1872, 73 Indian agencies were divided among religious denominations.<ref> Francis Paul Prucha, ''The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians'' (1984), pp. 501\u2013503.</ref> A core policy was to put the western reservations under the control of religious denominations.  In 1872, of the 73 agencies assigned, the Methodists received 14 reservations; the Orthodox Quakers ten; the Presbyterians nine; the Episcopalians eight; the Catholics seven; the Hicksite Quakers  six; the Baptists five; the Dutch Reformed five; the Congregationalists three; the Disciples two; Unitarians two; [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] one; and Lutherans one. The selection criteria were vague and some critics saw the Peace Policy as violating Native American freedom of religion. Catholics wanted a bigger role and set up the [[Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions]] in 1874. The Peace Policy remained in force until 1881.<ref>Francis Paul Prucha, ''American Indian Policy in Crisis, Christian Reformers and the Indian, 1865\u20131900'' (2014) pp. 30\u201371.</ref>  Historian Cary Collins says Grant's Peace Policy, failed in the Pacific Northwest chiefly because of sectarian competition and the priority placed on proselytizing by the religious denominations.<ref>Cary C.

From 1886 to 1926 the most active recruiting agency was the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions (SVM), which used its base on campus YMCAs to appeal to enlist over 8,000 young Protestants. The idea quickly was copied by the new World's Student Christian Federation (WSCF), with strength in  Great Britain, and Europe, and even as far as Australia, India, China and Japan.

If the Church can give it to them, plus Christianity, they will take it; otherwise they will get it elsewhere, without Christianity\u2014and that speedily.

The Commission's report, ''Re-Thinking Missions: A Laymen's Inquiry After One Hundred Years'' (1932) and known as the \"Hocking report,\" reflected changing ideas about the wisdom of a reduced role for western missionaries.

In the Thirteen colonies, Catholicism was introduced with the settling of [[Maryland]] in 1634; this colony offered a rare example of [[religious toleration]] in a fairly intolerant age. Maryland law remained a major center, as exemplified by the pre-eminence of the Archdiocese of Baltimore in Catholic circles. However, at the time of the [[American Revolution]], Catholics formed less than one percent of the white population of the thirteen states.<ref>In his report on the state of Catholicism, [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] in 1785 estimated the Catholic population in the 13 states was 25,000; the 1790 Census counted four million Americans.

''The religious history of America'' (2002) p. 100</ref>  Religiously, the Catholics were characterized by personalism, discipline, and a prayer life that was essentially personal, demanding only a small role for priests and none for bishops.  Ritualism was important, and focused on daily prayers, Sunday Mass, and observance of two dozen holy days.<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience: A History from Colonial Times to the Present'' (1985) p. 94</ref>\n\nThe main source of Catholics in the United States was the huge numbers of European immigrants of the 19th and 20th centuries, especially from Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Poland. Recently, most Catholic immigrants come from [[Latin America]], especially from Mexico.<ref>James Terence Fisher, ''Communion of Immigrants: A History of Catholics in America'' (2002)</ref>\n\nThe [[Irish Americans|Irish]] came to dominate the church, providing most of the bishops, college presidents and lay leaders. They strongly supported the \"[[ultramontane]]\" position favoring the authority of the pope.<ref>James J. Hennesey, ''American Catholics: A History of the Roman Catholic Community in the United States'' (1983)</ref>\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, the first attempt at standardizing discipline in the church occurred with the convocation of the [[Plenary Councils of Baltimore]]. These councils resulted in the [[Baltimore Catechism]] and the establishment of [[The Catholic University of America]].<ref>James M. O'Toole, et al. ''The Faithful: A History of Catholics in America'' (2009)</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s the church went through dramatic changes, especially in the liturgy and the use of the language of the people instead of Latin.  The number of priests and nuns declined sharply as few entered and many left their vocations. Since 1990 scandals involving the coverup by bishops of priests who sexually abused young men has led to massive financial payments across the country\u2014and indeed in Europe as well.\n\n==Eastern Orthodoxy==\n{{Main article|History of the Eastern Orthodox Church in North America|Timeline of Eastern Orthodoxy in America}}\n\nEastern Orthodoxy spread to the North American continent with the founding of [[Russian America]], in what is today the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[Alaska]].  The spreading of the Orthodox faith went along with the [[Russian colonization of the Americas]] during the 18th and 19th centuries.  From there, it spread to the continental United States with the influx of immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]].\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}\n\n==Judaism==\n{{main article|History of the Jews in the United States}}\nThe [[history of the Jews in the United States]] comprises a theological dimension, with a three-way division into Orthodox, Conservative and Reform. In social terms the [[American Jews|Jewish]] ethnic community began with small groups of merchants in colonial ports such as [[New York City]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. In the mid- and late-19th century well-educated German Jews arrived and settled in towns and cities across the United States, especially as dry goods merchants. From 1880 to 1924 large numbers of Yiddish-speaking Jews arrived from [[Eastern Europe]], settling in New York City and other large cities. After 1926 numbers came as refugees from Europe; after 1980 many came from the [[Soviet Union]], and there has been a flow from [[Israel]]. [[Historical Jewish population comparisons|By the year 1900]] the 1.5 million Jews residing in the United States were the third most of any nation, behind Russia and [[Austria-Hungary]]. The proportion of the population has been about 2% to 3% since 1900, and in the 21st century Jews were widely diffused in major metropolitan areas around New York or the [[Northeastern United States]], and especially in [[South Florida]] and [[California]].<ref>Hasia Diner, ''The Jews of the United States, 1654\u20132000'' (2006)</ref><ref>Jonathan D.

Despite a common background, the groups' views on broader [[religious toleration]] were mixed. While some notable examples such as [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] of [[Rhode Island]] and [[William Penn]] ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies, others such as the [[Plymouth Colony]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] had established churches. The Dutch colony of the [[New Netherlands]] had also established the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] and outlawed all other worship, although enforcement by the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the last years of the colony was sparse.  Part of the reason for establishment was financial: the established Church was responsible for [[poor relief]], and dissenting churches would therefore have a significant advantage.\n\nThere were also opponents to the support of any established church even at the state level.  In 1773, [[Isaac Backus]], a prominent Baptist minister in [[New England]], observed that when \"church and state are separate, the effects are happy, and they do not at all interfere with each other: but where they have been confounded together, no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued.\"  Thomas Jefferson's influential [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] was enacted in 1786, five years before the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].\n\nMost Anglican ministers, and many Anglicans outside the South, were [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]. The Anglican Church was disestablished during the Revolution, and following the separation from Britain was reorganized as the independent [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].\n\n===Establishment Clause===\nThe [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] reads, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .\" In a letter written in 1802, [[Thomas Jefferson]] used the phrase \"[[separation of church and state]]\" to describe the combined effect of the Establishment Clause and the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]]. Though \"separation of church and state\" does not appear in the Constitution, it has since been quoted in several opinions handed down by the [[United States Supreme Court]].<ref>Jefferson's Danbury letter has been cited favorably by the Supreme Court many times. In its 1879 [[Reynolds v. United States]] decision the high court said Jefferson's observations 'may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [First] Amendment.' In the court's 1947 [[Everson v. Board of Education]] decision, Justice [[Hugo Black]] wrote, 'In the words of Thomas Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state.'</ref>\n\n[[Robert N. Bellah]] has argued in his writings that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the United States, this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the United States. He used the term [[Civil Religion]] to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the United States. His 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of [[John F. Kennedy]]: ''\"Considering the separation of church and state, how is a president justified in using the word 'God' at all?

''Divided by God''. p. 24 (\"Williams's metaphor was rediscovered by [[Isaac Backus]], a New England Baptist of Jefferson's generation, who believed, like Williams, that an established church\u2014which he considered to exist in the Massachusetts of his day\u2014would never protect religious dissenters like himself and must be opposed in order to keep religion pure.\")</ref>  It was later used by Jefferson as a commentary on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government, in an 1802 letter.\n\nJefferson's and Madison's conceptions of ''separation'' have long been debated.  Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia and vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment.\n\nAfter retiring from the presidency, Madison argued in his detached memoranda<ref>[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions64.html James Madison's Detached Memoranda]</ref> for a stronger separation of church and state, opposing the very presidential issuing of religious proclamations he himself had done, and also opposing the appointment of chaplains to Congress.\n\nJefferson's opponents said his position meant the rejection of Christianity, but this was a caricature. In setting up the University of Virginia, Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own, though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity, arising from his own [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]].<ref>Dumas Malone, ''Jefferson and his Times'' 6:393</ref>\n\n====Test acts====\n{{main article|No religious test clause}}\nThe absence of an establishment of religion did not necessarily imply that all men were free to hold office. Most colonies had a [[Test Act]], and several states retained them for a short time.  This stood in contrast to the Federal Constitution, which explicitly prohibits the employment of any religious test for Federal office, and which through the Fourteenth Amendment later extended this prohibition to the States.<ref>Bradley, Gerard V. \"No Religious Test Clause and the Constitution of Religious Liberty: A Machine That Has Gone of Itself, The.\" ''Case Western Reserve Law Review'' 37 (1986): 674.

While the ruling upheld the state law allowing taxpayer funding of transportation to religious schools as constitutional, ''Everson'' was also the first case to hold the Establishment Clause applicable to the state legislatures as well as Congress, based upon the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref name=\"Jonathan A.

In [[Lee v. Weisman]] The Supreme Court held in 1992:\n:the State may not place the student dissenter in the dilemma of participating or protesting. Since adolescents are often susceptible to peer pressure, especially in matters of social convention, the State may no more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use direct means. The embarrassment and intrusion of the religious exercise cannot be refuted by arguing that the prayers are of a de minimis character, since that is an affront to ...those for whom the prayers have meaning, and since any intrusion was both real and a violation of the objectors' rights.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Palestini |author2=Karen Palestini Falk|title=Law and American Education: An Instructor's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhP3CT4P2-AC&pg=PA33|year=2002|publisher=R&L Education|page=33|isbn=9781461731634}}</ref><ref>505 U.S. 577, Syllabus.</ref>\n\nIn 1962, the Supreme Court extended this analysis to the issue of prayer in public schools.  In [[Engel v. Vitale]] 370 U.S. 421 (1962), the Court determined it unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools, even when it is non-denominational and students may excuse themselves from participation.  As such, any teacher, faculty, or student can pray in school, in accordance with their own religion.  However, they may not lead such prayers in class, or in other \"official\" school settings such as assemblies or programs.\n\nCurrently, the Supreme Court applies a three-pronged test to determine whether legislation comports with the Establishment Clause, known as the \"[[Lemon Test]]\". First, the legislature must have adopted the law with a neutral or non-religious purpose. Second, the statute's principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Third, the statute must not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion.<ref name=\"Jonathan A.

In the late 19th and early 20th century most major denominations started overseas missionary activity.  The \"[[Mainline Protestant]]\" denominations promoted the \"[[Social Gospel]]\" in the early 20th century, calling on Americans to reform their society; the demand for [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of liquor]] was especially strong. After 1970, the mainline denominations (such as Methodists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians) lost membership and influence. The more conservative [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], and [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] denominations (such as the Southern Baptists) grew rapidly until the 1990s and helped form the [[Christian right|Religious Right]] in politics. The nation had a Catholic population from its founding, and as it expanded into areas that had been part of the Spanish and French empires, that population increased substantially.  Immigration from Catholic countries increased Catholic diversity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Catholic Church has been the largest religious organization in the United States since at least the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nAs Western Europe secularized in the late 20th century, the Americans largely resisted the trend, so that by the 21st century the US was one of the most strongly Christian of all major nations.

Traditional Native American ceremonial ways can vary widely, and are based on the differing histories and beliefs of individual tribes, clans and bands. Early European explorers describe individual [[tribe (Native American)|Native American tribes]] and even small bands as each having their own religious practices. Theology may be [[Monotheism|monotheistic]], [[Polytheism|polytheistic]], [[Henotheism|henotheistic]], [[Animism|animistic]], or some combination thereof. Traditional beliefs are usually passed down in the forms of oral histories, stories, allegories and principles, and rely on face to face teaching in one's family and community.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u00c5ke Hultkrantz|title=The Religions of the American Indians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zo9nzMQLBEIC|year=1981|publisher=University of California Press|pages=1\u2013156|isbn=9780520042391}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ten-sq\u00faat-a-way.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Tenskwatawa, by [[George Catlin]].]]\n\nFrom time to time important religious leaders organized revivals. In Indiana in 1805, [[Tenskwatawa]]  (called the Shanee Prophet by Americans) led a religious revival following a smallpox epidemic and a series of witch-hunts. His beliefs were based on the earlier teachings of the [[Lenape]] prophets, [[Scattamek]] and [[Neolin]], who predicted a coming apocalypse that would destroy the European-American settlers.<ref>Adam Jortner, ''The Gods of Prophetstown: The Battle of Tippecanoe and the Holy War for the American Frontier'' (2011)</ref>  Tenskwatawa urged the tribes to reject the ways of the Americans: to give up firearms, liquor, American style clothing, to pay traders only half the value of their debts, and to refrain from ceding any more lands to the United States. The revival led to warfare led by his brother [[Tecumseh]] against the white settlers.<ref>Rachel Buff, \"Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa: Myth, Historiography and Popular Memory.\" ''Historical Reflections/R\u00e9flexions Historiques'' (1995): 277\u2013299.</ref>\n\nNative Americans were the target of extensive Christian missionary activity. Catholics launched [[Jesuit Missions amongst the Huron]] and the [[Spanish missions in California]]) and various Protestant denominations.  Numerous Protestant denominations were active.

Their position was opposed by the ruling class by the 1620s, which insisted that the Puritans conform to Anglican religious practices. Puritans in England were threatened as England verged on civil war.\n\nBeginning in 1630 and for the decade as many as 20,000 Puritans emigrated to America from England. Most settled in New England, but some went as far as the West Indies. Some went back to England during the English Civil War 1642-1646 and the Commonwealth.  Theologically, the Puritans were \"non-separating [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].\" Unlike the Pilgrims, who came to Massachusetts in 1620, the Puritans believed that the Church of England was a true church, though in need of major reforms. Every New England Congregational church was considered an independent entity, beholden to no hierarchy. There were no bishops. The membership was composed, at least initially, of men and women who had undergone a conversion experience and could prove it to other members.\n\n===Persecution in America===\n[[Image:Roger Williams statue by Franklin Simmons.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] was expelled from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1636 for advocating [[religious liberty]].]]\nAlthough they were victims of religious persecution in Europe, the Puritans supported the theory that sanctioned it: the need for uniformity of religion in the state.\n\nOnce in control in New England, they sought to break \"the very neck of Schism and vile opinions.\" The \"business\" of the first settlers, a Puritan minister recalled in 1681, \"was not Toleration, but [they] were professed enemies of it.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings|page=185|author=Thomas Herbert Johnson}}</ref> Puritans expelled dissenters from their colonies, a fate that in 1636 befell Roger Williams and in 1638 [[Anne Hutchinson]], America's first major female religious leader.\n\nThose who defied the Puritans by persistently returning to their jurisdictions risked [[capital punishment]], a penalty imposed on the [[Boston martyrs]], four [[Quaker]]s, between 1659 and 1661. Reflecting on the 17th century's intolerance, Thomas Jefferson was unwilling to concede to Virginians any moral superiority to the Puritans. Beginning in 1659, Virginia enacted anti-Quaker laws, including the death penalty for refractory Quakers. Jefferson surmised that \"if no capital execution took place here, as did in New England, it was not owing to the moderation of the church, or the spirit of the legislature.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_s5t3 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_s5t3/page/365 365] |title=A brief guide to beliefs: ideas, theologies, mysteries, and movements |last=Edwards |first=Linda |location=Westminster|publisher= John Knox Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-664-22259-8}}</ref>\n\n====Founding of Rhode Island====\nExpelled from Massachusetts in the winter in 1636, former Puritan leader Roger Williams issued an impassioned plea for freedom of conscience.

Small numbers of Jews continued to come to the British North American colonies, settling mainly in the seaport towns.

Jones formulated the first theory of the origins and essence of Quakerism as fundamentally \"mystical\" in his introduction to William Braithwaite's history of Quakerism [Jones based his introduction on an earlier exploration of the history of Christian mysticism, Studies in Mystical Religion, one of a handful of pioneering works in that  field in The early Twentieth century (1909). A few years later he expanded his study with Spiritual Reformers of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (1914)] (Braithwaite, 1912). ln 1921, he emphatically reaffirmed his thesis: \"No other large, organized, historically continuous body of Christians has yet existed which has been so fundamentally mystical, both in theory and practice, as the Society of Friends ... \" (Jones, 190 I, xiii). For over 25 years, Jones' claim seemed too accurate to question. But in 1955 a major shift in Quaker studies occurred when Hugh L. Doncaster claimed that new scholarship viewed Quakerism in another light. [See L. Hugh Doncaster, \"Forward to the Second Edition,\" in Wm. C. Braithwaite's The Beginnings of Quakerism, ed. Henry J. Cadbury (1955).] The paradigm shift had been set in motion with the publication of Geoffrey F. Nuttall's work, The Holy Spirit in Puritan Faith and Experience, in 1946 (revised 1992). Nuttall, a non-Quaker historian, supplanted .Jones' mystical theory with a new theory of Quakers as radical Puritans. According to NuttalI, George Fox and the Quakers, \"... who in the exclusive sense are not puritans but the puritans' fiercest foes, ... repeat, extend, and fuse so much of what is held by the radical, Separatist party within Puritanism, that they cannot be denied the name or excluded from consideration.\"}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/holyspiritinpuri0000nutt|url-access=registration|title=The Holy Spirit in Puritan Faith and Experience|last=Nuttall|first=Geoffrey F.|date=1992-07-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226609416|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/holyspiritinpuri0000nutt/page/13 13]|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Durnbaugh|first=Donald F.|date=2012-04-04|title=Baptists and Quakers\u2014Left Wing Puritans?|journal=Quaker History|volume=62|issue=2|pages=67\u201382|doi=10.1353/qkh.1973.0005|issn=1934-1504}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horle|first=Craig W.|date=1976-01-01|title=Quakers and Baptists 1647\u20131660|journal=Baptist Quarterly|volume=26|issue=8|pages=344\u2013362|doi=10.1080/0005576X.1976.11751464|issn=0005-576X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maclear|first=James F.|date=1950-12-01|title=Quakerism and the end of the Interregnum: a Chapter in the Domestication of Radical Puritanism|journal=Church History|volume=19|issue=4|pages=240\u2013270|doi=10.2307/3161160|issn=1755-2613|jstor=3161160}}</ref> Historians in support of the Puritan classification of Quakers notice that Quakers stretch the sober deportment of the Puritans into a glorification of \"plainness.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p0jndZXU-34C&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=sober+deportment+of+the+Puritans+into+a+glorification+of+%22plainness.%22#v=onepage&q=sober%20deportment%20of%20the%20Puritans%20into%20a%20glorification%20of%20%22plainness.%22&f=false|title=America on the Cusp of God's Grace: The Biblical Connection to the Stars and Stripes|last=Hurst|first=Dennis G.|date=2010-11-12|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781450269551|location=|pages=14|language=en|quote=They stretched the sober deportment of the Puritans into a glorification of \"plainness.\" Theologically, they expanded the Puritan concept of a church of individuals ...}}</ref> Theologically, they expanded the Puritan concept of a church of individuals regenerated by the [[Holy Spirit]] to the idea of the indwelling of the Spirit or the \"Light of Christ\" in every person.\n\nSuch teaching struck many of the Quakers' contemporaries as dangerous [[heresy]]. Quakers were severely persecuted in England for daring to deviate so far from orthodox Christianity. By 1680, 10,000 Quakers had been imprisoned in England and 243 had died of torture and mistreatment in jail.\n\nThis reign of terror impelled Friends to seek refuge in Rhode Island in the 1670s, where they soon became well entrenched. In 1681, when Quaker leader [[William Penn]] parlayed a debt owed by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to his father into a charter for the province of [[Pennsylvania]], many more Quakers were prepared to grasp the opportunity to live in a land where they might worship freely. By 1685, as many as 8,000 Quakers had come to Pennsylvania from England, Wales, and Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Although the Quakers may have resembled the Puritans in some religious beliefs and practices, they differed with them over the necessity of compelling [[religious uniformity]] in society.\n\n===Pennsylvania Germans===\nDuring the main years of German emigration to Pennsylvania in the mid-18th century, most of the emigrants were Lutherans, Reformed, or members of small sects\u2014[[Mennonite]]s, [[Amish]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Dunkers]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] and [[Schwenkfelders]]. The great majority became farmers.<ref>Joseph E. Illick, ''Colonial Pennsylvania: A History'' (1976)</ref>\n\nThe colony was owned by [[William Penn]], a leading Quaker, and his agents encouraged German emigration to Pennsylvania by circulating promotional literature touting the economic advantages of Pennsylvania as well as the religious liberty available there.

Driven by \"the sacred duty of finding a refuge for his Roman Catholic brethren,\" [[George Calvert]] obtained a charter from Charles I in 1632 for the territory between Pennsylvania and Virginia.<ref>{{cite book |author=Charles McLean Andrews|title=The colonial period of American history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CTN2AAAAMAAJ|year=1936|publisher=Yale University Press|page=279}}</ref>  This Maryland charter offered no guidelines on religion, although it was assumed that Catholics would not be molested in the new colony.  His son [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]], was a Catholic who inherited the grant for Maryland from his father and was in charge 1630\u201345. In 1634, Lord Baltimore's two ships, the ''Ark'' and the ''Dove'', sailed with the first 200 settlers to Maryland. They included two Catholic priests. Lord Baltimore assumed that religion was a private matter. He rejected the need for an established church, guaranteed liberty of conscience to all Christians, and embraced pluralism.<ref>John D.

After the [[Glorious Revolution of 1689]] in England, the Church of England was legally established in the colony and English penal laws, which deprived Catholics of the right to vote, hold office, or worship publicly, were enforced.  Maryland's first state constitution in 1776 restored the freedom of religion.<ref>Beatriz Betancourt Hardy, \"Roman Catholics, Not Papists: Catholic Identity in Maryland, 1689\u20131776,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' (1997) 92#2 pp. 138\u2013161</ref>\n\n===Virginia and the Church of England===\n{{main article|Religion in early Virginia|Episcopal Diocese of Virginia#History}}\nVirginia was the largest, most populous and most important colony. The Church of England was legally established; the bishop of London who had oversight of Anglican in the colonies made it a favorite missionary target and sent in 22 clergymen (in priestly orders) by 1624.  In practice, establishment meant that local taxes were funneled through the local parish to handle the needs of local government, such as roads and poor relief, in addition to the salary of the minister.  There was never a bishop in colonial Virginia, and in practice the local vestry consisted of laymen who controlled the parish and handled local taxes, roads and poor relief.<ref>Edward L.

Some ministers solved their problems by encouraging parishioners to become devout at home, using the ''Book of Common Prayer'' for private prayer and devotion (rather than the Bible). This allowed devout Anglicans to lead an active and sincere religious life apart from the unsatisfactory formal church services. However, the stress on private devotion weakened the need for a bishop or a large institutional church of the sort Blair wanted. The stress on personal piety opened the way for the [[First Great Awakening]], which pulled people away from the established church.<ref>Edward L.

It resulted from powerful preaching that deeply affected listeners (already church members) with a deep sense of personal guilt and salvation by Christ.  Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made relationship with God intensely personal to the average person by creating a deep sense of spiritual guilt, forgiveness, redemption and peace. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom sees it as part of a \"great international Protestant upheaval\" that also created [[Pietism]] in Germany, the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Revival]] and [[Methodism]] in England.<ref>Sydney E. Armstrong, ''A Religious History of the American People''. (1972) p. 263</ref> It brought Christianity to the slaves and was an apocalyptic event in [[New England]] that challenged established church authority. It resulted in division between the new revivalists and the old traditionalists who insisted on ritual and doctrine.\nThe new style of sermons and the way people practiced their faith breathed new life into Christian faith in America. People became passionately and emotionally involved in their relationship with God, rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse in a detached manner. Ministers who used this new style of preaching were generally called \"new lights\", while the preachers of old were called \"old lights\". People began to study the [[Bible]] at home, which effectively decentralized the means of informing the public on religious manners and was akin to the individualistic trends present in Europe during the [[Protestant Reformation]].<ref name=\"Thomas S. Kidd 2007\"/>\n\nThe fundamental premise of evangelicalism is the conversion of individuals from a state of sin to a \"[[Born again Christianity|new birth]]\" through preaching of the Bible leading to [[Salvation by faith|faith]]. The First Great Awakening led to changes in American colonial society. In New England, the Great Awakening was influential among many [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].  In the Middle and Southern colonies, especially in the \"Backcountry\" regions, the Awakening was influential among [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]. In the South [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist]] preachers converted both whites and enslaved blacks.<ref>Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)</ref>\n\nDuring the first decades of the 18th century, in the [[Connecticut River Valley]], a series of local \"awakenings\" began in the Congregational church with ministers including [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]. The first new Congregational Church in the Massachusetts Colony during the great awakening period, was in 1731 at [[Uxbridge, MA|Uxbridge]] and called the Rev. [[Nathan Webb]] as its Pastor. By the 1730s, they had spread into what was interpreted as a general outpouring of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Spirit]] that bathed the American colonies, England, Wales, and Scotland.\n\nIn mass open-air revivals powerful preachers like [[George Whitefield]] brought thousands of souls to the [[Born again (Christianity)|new birth]]. The Great Awakening, which had spent its force in New England by the mid-1740s, split the Congregational and Presbyterian churches into supporters\u2014called \"[[New Lights]]\" and \"[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Side]]\"\u2014and opponents\u2014the \"Old Lights\" and \"Old Side.\" Many New England New Lights became [[Separate Baptists]]. Largely through the efforts of a charismatic preacher from New England named [[Shubal Stearns]] and paralleled by the New Side Presbyterians (who were eventually reunited on their own terms with the Old Side), they carried the Great Awakening into the southern colonies, igniting a series of the revivals that lasted well into the 19th century.<ref name=\"LOC Religion 18th century\"/>\n\nThe supporters of the Awakening and its evangelical thrust\u2014[[Presbyterian]]s, Baptists and [[Methodist]]s\u2014became the largest American Protestant denominations by the first decades of the 19th century. Opponents of the Awakening or those split by it\u2014Anglicans, Quakers, and Congregationalists\u2014were left behind.\n\nUnlike the [[Second Great Awakening]] that began about 1800 and which reached out to the unchurched, the First Great Awakening focused on people who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety, and their self-awareness.<ref name=\"Thomas S. Kidd 2007\">Thomas S.

Baptist services emphasized emotion; the only ritual,  baptism, involved immersion (not sprinkling as in the Anglican tradition) of adults only. Opposed to the low moral standards prevalent around them, the Baptists strictly enforced their own high standards of personal morality, and especially opposed sexual misconduct, heavy drinking, frivolous spending, missing services, cursing, and revelry.  Church trials took place frequently, and Baptist churches expelled members who did not submit to discipline.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Spangler\n| first1                = Jewel L.\n| title                 = Virginians Reborn: Anglican Monopoly, Evangelical Dissent, and the Rise of the Baptists in the Late Eighteenth Century\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=R0RVN0vx50gC\n| location              = Charlottesville\n| publisher             = University of Virginia Press\n| date      = 2008\n| page                  = \n| isbn                  = 9780813926797\n}}\n</ref>\n\nMany historians have debated the implications of the religious rivalries for the coming of the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u20131783.<ref>Bonomi, ''Under the Cope of Heaven: Religion, Society, and Politics in Colonial America'' (1988) pp. 187\u2013222 and 269\u201378, cites over forty scholars.</ref>  The Baptist farmers did introduce a new egalitarian ethic that largely displaced the semi-aristocratic ethic of the Anglican planters. However, both groups supported the Revolution.  There was a sharp contrast between the austerity of the plain-living Baptists and the opulence of the Anglican planters, who controlled local government. Baptist church discipline, mistaken by the gentry for radicalism, served to ameliorate disorder. The struggle for religious toleration erupted and played out during the [[American Revolution]], as the Baptists worked to disestablish the Anglican church.<ref>Rhys Isaac, \"Evangelical Revolt: The Nature of the Baptists' Challenge to the Traditional Order in Virginia, 1765 to 1775,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 1974 31(3): 345\u2013368</ref>\n\nBaptists, [[German American|German Lutherans]] and Presbyterians funded their own ministers, and favored disestablishment of the Anglican church.\n\n====Methodists====\nMethodist missionaries were also active in the late colonial period. From 1776 to 1815 Methodist Bishop [[Francis Asbury]] made 42 trips into the western parts to visit Methodist congregations. In the 1780s itinerant Methodist preachers carried copies of an anti-slavery petition in their saddlebags throughout the state, calling for an end to slavery. At the same time, counter-petitions were circulated. The petitions were presented to the Assembly; they were debated, but no legislative action was taken, and after 1800 there was less and less religious opposition to slavery.<ref>Richard K.

Religious practice suffered in certain places because of the absence of ministers and the destruction of churches.\n\n===Church of England===\n{{main article|Episcopal Church (United States)}}\nThe American Revolution inflicted deeper wounds on the [[Church of England]] in America than on any other denomination because the [[English monarch]] was the head of the church. Church of England priests, at their ordination, swore allegiance to the [[British crown]].\n\nThe [[Book of Common Prayer]] offered prayers for the monarch, beseeching God \"to be his defender and keeper, giving him victory over all his enemies,\" who in 1776 were American soldiers as well as friends and neighbors of American parishioners of the Church of England. Loyalty to the church and to its head could be construed as treason to the American cause.\n\nPatriotic American members of the Church of England, loathing to discard so fundamental a component of their faith as The Book of Common Prayer, revised it to conform to the political realities.  After the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] in which Great Britain  formally recognized American independence, Anglicans were left without leadership or a formal institution. Samuel Seabury was consecrated bishop by the Scottish Episcopal Church in 1784. He resided in New York. After the requirement to take an Oath of Allegiance to the Crown two Americans were consecrated bishops in London in 1786 for Virginia and Pennsylvania. The Protestant [[Episcopal Church of the United States]] was created in 1787 as an autonomous in communion with the Church of England. It adopted a modified Book of Common Prayer which most notably used the Scottish Canon (Eucharistic Prayer). This consecration prayer moved the eucharistic doctrine of the American Church much closer to the Roman Catholic and Orthodox teachings and virtually undid Cranmer's rejection of the eucharist as a material sacrifice offered to God (which had been the accepted theology from the early 3rd century).\n\n==The new nation==\nHistorians in recent decades have debated the nature of American religiosity in the early 19th century, focusing on issues of secularism, deism, traditional religious practices, and newly emerging evangelical forms based on the [[Great Awakening]].<ref>Christopher Grasso, \"The Religious and the Secular in the Early American Republic,\" ''Journal of the Early Republic'' (Summer 2016) 36#2 pp. 359\u2013388.</ref><ref>Craig Calhoun, Mark Juergensmeyer, and Jonathan VanAntwerpen, eds.

However, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], adopted in 1791, has played a central role in defining the relationship of the federal government to the free exercise of religion, and to the prohibition establishment of an official church. Its policies were extended to cover state governments in the 1940s.  The government is not allowed to hinder the free exercise of religion, and is not allowed to sponsor any particular religion through taxation of favors.<ref>James S.

The treaty was a routine diplomatic agreement but has attracted later attention because the English version included a clause about religion in the United States. \n<blockquote>As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion,\u2014as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Muslims]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>,\u2014and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Mohammedan]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Franklin T. Lambert|Frank Lambert]], Professor of History at [[Purdue University]], the assurances in Article 11 were \"intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced.  John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers.\" Lambert writes, \n:\"By their actions, the Founding Fathers made clear that their primary concern was religious freedom, not the advancement of a state religion. Individuals, not the government, would define religious faith and practice in the United States. Thus the Founders ensured that in no official sense would America be a Christian Republic. Ten years after the Constitutional Convention ended its work, the country assured the world that the United States was a secular state, and that its negotiations would adhere to the rule of law, not the dictates of the Christian faith. The assurances were contained in the Treaty of Tripoli of 1797 and were intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced. John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank Lambert|title=The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CHIomb78VgC|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12602-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4CHIomb78VgC&pg=PA11 11]}}</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding the clear separation of government and religion, the predominant cultural and social nature of the nation did become strongly Christian.

The Methodists and Baptists were the most active at sponsoring revivals. The number of Methodist church members grew from 58,000 in 1790 to 258,000 in 1820 and 1,661,000 in 1860. Over 70 years Methodist membership grew by a factor of 28.6 times when the total national population grew by a factor of eight times.<ref>US Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States: From: the Colonial Times to the Present'' (1976) pp. 8, 392</ref>\n\nIt made [[evangelicalism]] one of the dominant forces in American religion. Balmer explains that:\n:\"Evangelicalism itself, I believe, is quintessentially North American phenomenon, deriving as it did from the confluence of Pietism, Presbyterianism, and the vestiges of Puritanism. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain \u2013 warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans \u2013 even as the North American context itself has profoundly shaped the various manifestations of evangelicalism.: fundamentalism, neo-evangelicalism, the holiness movement, Pentecostalism, the charismatic movement, and various forms of African-American and Hispanic evangelicalism.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Randall Balmer|title=The Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C&pg=PR8|year=2002|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=vii\u2013viii|isbn=9780664224097}}</ref>\n\n===Second Great Awakening===\n[[File:1839-meth.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1839 Methodist camp meeting]]\n{{main article|Second Great Awakening}}\n{{see also|Camp meeting|Revival meeting}}\n\nIn 1800, major revivals began that spread across the nation: the decorous [[Second Great Awakening]] in New England and the exuberant [[Great Revival]] in [[Cane Ridge, Kentucky|Cane Ridge]], [[Kentucky]]. The principal religious innovation produced by the Kentucky revivals was the [[camp meeting]].\n\nThe revivals at first were organized by Presbyterian ministers who modeled them after the extended outdoor [[communion seasons]], used by the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, which frequently produced emotional, demonstrative displays of religious conviction. In Kentucky, the pioneers loaded their families and provisions into their wagons and drove to the Presbyterian meetings, where they pitched tents and settled in for several days.\n\nWhen assembled in a field or at the edge of a forest for a prolonged religious meeting, the participants transformed the site into a camp meeting. The religious revivals that swept the Kentucky camp meetings were so intense and created such gusts of emotion that their original sponsors, the Presbyterians, as well the Baptists, soon repudiated them. The Methodists, however, adopted and eventually domesticated camp meetings and introduced them into the eastern states, where for decades they were one of the evangelical signatures of the denomination.\n\nThe Second Great Awakening (1800\u20131830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. The great revival quickly spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee and southern Ohio. Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. The Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on ministers known as [[circuit rider (religious)|circuit rider]]s, who sought out people in remote frontier locations. The circuit riders came from among the common people, which helped them establish rapport with the frontier families they hoped to convert.\n\nThe Second Great Awakening exercised a profound impact on American religious history.  By 1859 evangelicalism emerged as a kind of national church or national religion and was the grand absorbing theme of American religious life.  The greatest gains were made by the very well organized Methodists. [[Francis Asbury]] (1745\u20131816) led the [[United Methodist Church|American Methodist movement]] as one of the most prominent religious leaders of the young republic.  Traveling throughout the eastern seaboard, [[Methodism]] grew quickly under Asbury's leadership into the nation's largest and most widespread denomination.  The numerical strength of the Baptists and Methodists rose relative to that of the denominations dominant in the colonial period\u2014the [[Anglicans]], Presbyterians, [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]]. Efforts to apply Christian teaching to the resolution of social problems presaged the [[Social Gospel]] of the late 19th century.  It also sparked the beginnings of groups such as the [[Mormons]], the [[Restoration Movement]] and the [[Holiness movement]].\n\n===Third Great Awakening===\n{{main article|Third Great Awakening}}\nThe Third Great Awakening was a period of religious activism in American history from the late 1850s to the 20th century. It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong sense of social activism.  It gathered strength from the [[postmillennial]] theology that the [[Second Coming]] of Christ would come after mankind had reformed the entire earth.  The [[Social Gospel]] Movement gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement.  New groupings emerged, such as the [[Holiness movement]] and [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]] movements, and [[Christian Science]].<ref>Robert William Fogel, ''The Fourth Great Awakening & the Future of Egalitarianism'' (2000)</ref>\n\nThe Protestant mainline churches were growing rapidly in numbers, wealth and educational levels, throwing off their frontier beginnings and become centered in towns and cities. Intellectuals and writers such as [[Josiah Strong]] advocated a muscular Christianity with systematic outreach to the unchurched in America and around the globe.  Others built colleges and universities to train the next generation. Each denomination supported active missionary societies, and made the role of missionary one of high prestige.  The great majority of pietistic mainline Protestants (in the North) supported the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and urged it to endorse prohibition and social reforms.<ref>Paul Kleppner, ''The Third Electoral System, 1853\u20131892: Parties, Voters, and Political Cultures'' (2009)</ref><ref>Richard Jensen, ''The Winning of the Midwest'' (1971) p. 171</ref> See [[Third Party System]]\n\nThe awakening in numerous cities in 1858 was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]].

Changing social conditions forced a shift from the gospel of wealth to the Social Gospel. the \"[[Gospel of wealth]]\" was an appeal to rich Christians to share their wealth in philanthropy, while the Social Gospel called on ministers to take the lead themselves in eliminating social evils. The second challenge emerged from modern science, where evolutionary Darwinism generated quite different religious responses in terms of biblical authoritarianism, romantic liberalism and scientific modernism. Protestantism gradually abandoned its emphasis on individual salvation and laissez-faire individualism; although this tendency was resisted by fundamentalists who sought, often blindly, to cling to the theological foundations of Christianity to which the denominations have begun again to return.<ref>Sidney E.  Mead, \"American Protestantism since the Civil War. II. From Americanism to Christianity.\" ''Journal of Religion'' 36.2 (1956): 67-89.

According to historian R. Laurence Moore, Christian Scientists, Pentecostals, Jehovah Witnesses and Catholics responded to hostile comments by sensing themselves as persecuted Americans on the margins of society, which made them cling tightly to their status as full citizens.. <ref>R. Laurence Moore, '' Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans'' (1986)</ref>\n\n===The  South===\nHistorian [[Edward Ayers]] describes an impoverished South with a rich Spiritual life:\n: Religious faith and language appeared everywhere in the New South. It permeated public speech as well as private emotion. For many people, religion provided the measure of politics, the power behind law and reform, the reason to reach out to the poor and exploited, a pressure to cross racial boundaries. People viewed everything from courtship to child-rearing to their own deaths in religious terms. Even those filled with doubt or disdain could not escape the images, the assumptions, the power of faith.<ref> Edward Ayres, ''The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction'' (1992), p 160. </ref>\nThe Baptists formed the largest grouping, for both Blacks and whites, with its loose networks of numerous small rural churches churches.  In second place for both races came the Methodists, with a hierarchical structure at the opposite end of the spectrum from the Baptists. Smaller fundamentalist groups that grew very large in the 20th century were starting to appear. Clusters of Roman Catholics appeared in the region's few cities, as well as southern Louisiana. Elite white Southerners, for the most part, were Episcopalians or Presbyterians. Across the region, ministers held high prestige positions, especially in the black community where they were typically political leaders as well. When the great majority Blacks were disenfranchised after 1890, the black preachers were still allowed to vote. Revivals were regular occurrences, attracting large crowds. It was usually the already converted who attended, so the number of new converts was relatively small but new or old, the all enjoyed the preaching and the socializing.<ref> Edward Ayres, ''The Promise of the New South'' (1992), pp  160. </ref><ref>Kenneth K.

The goal was to apply[[Christian ethics]] to [[social issue|social problem]]s, especially issues of [[social justice]] and  [[social evil]]s such as [[economic inequality]], [[poverty]], [[alcoholism]], [[crime]], [[Ethnic conflict|racial tensions]], [[slum]]s, unclean environment, [[child labor]], lack of [[labour unions|unionization]], poor schools, and the dangers of war.  Theologically, the Social Gospelers sought to put into practice the [[Lord's Prayer]]: \"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven\".<ref>Cecelia Tichi, ''Civic Passions: Seven Who Launched Progressive America (and What They Teach Us). (2009) pp 205-239. [https://archive.org/details/civicpassionssev0000tich online]</ref> They typically were [[postmillennialism|postmillennialist]]; that is, they believed the [[Second Coming]] could not happen until humankind rid itself of [[social evil]]s by human effort. Social Gospel theologians rejected [[premillennialist]] theology, which held the [[Second Coming]] of Christ was imminent, and Christians should devote their energies to preparing for it rather than social issues. That perspective was strongest among fundamentalists and in the South. The Social Gospel was more popular among clergy than laity.  Its leaders were predominantly associated with the liberal wing of the [[progressive movement]], and most were [[Liberal Christianity|theologically liberal]]. Important leaders included [[Richard T. Ely]], [[Josiah Strong]], [[Washington Gladden]], and [[Walter Rauschenbusch]].  Many politicians came under its influence, notably [[William Jennings Bryan]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]]. The most controversial Social Gospel reform was  [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], which was highly popular in rural areas \u2013 including the South \u2013 and unpopular in the larger cities where mainline Protestantism was weak among the electorate.<ref>Christopher H. Evans, ''The Social Gospel in American Religion: A History.''

[[William Bell Riley]] took the initiative in the 1925 [[Scopes Trial]] by bringing in famed politician [[William Jennings Bryan]] as an assistant to the local prosecutor, Bryan drew national media attention to the trial. In the half century after the Scopes Trial, fundamentalists had little success in shaping government policy, and they were generally defeated in their efforts to reshape the [[Mainline Protestant|mainline denominations]], which refused to join fundamentalist attacks on evolution. Particularly after the Scopes Trial, liberals saw a division between Christians in favor of the teaching of evolution, whom they viewed as educated and tolerant, and Christians against evolution, whom they viewed as narrow-minded, tribal, obscurantist.<ref>David Goetz, \"The Monkey Trial\".

After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar antievolution laws for their states. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study, or at least relegate it to the status of unproven theory perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than in other US areas and persisted through the Sputnik era.<ref>George E.

Handy identifies a religious depression in the United States starting around 1925, that only grew worse during the economic depression which began in 1929. The identification of Protestantism with American culture undermined the religious messages. The fundamentalist churches said over expanded and were financially troubled. The mainstream churches were well enough financed in the late 1920s, but lost their self-confidence in terms of whether their social gospel was needed in an age of prosperity, especially since the great reform of prohibition was a failure. In terms of their network of international missions, the mainstream churches realized that the missions were a success in terms of opening modern schools and hospitals but a failure in terms of conversions. The leading theorist Daniel Fleming proclaimed that the continents for Christian outreach and Christian .conquest were no longer Africa and Asia, but rather, materialism, racial injustice, war and poverty. The number of missionaries from mainstream denominations began a steep decline.  By contrast, the evangelical and fundamentalist churches--never wedded to the social gospel-- escalated their efforts worldwide with a focus on conversion.<ref>William R.

Suddenly in 1932\u201333, the mainline churches lost one of their historic functions in distributing alms to the poor, and the national government took over that role without any religious dimension.  Handy argues that the deep self-doubt the religious revivals customary in times of economic depression was absent in the 1930s.  He concludes that Great Depression marked the end of the dominance of Protestantism in American life.<ref>Robert T.

Only a minority of religious leaders, typified by [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], paid serious attention to the threats to peace posed by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, or militaristic Japan.  After Pearl Harbor in December 1941, practically all the religious denominations gave some support to the war effort, such as providing chaplains. The pacifist churches, such as the Quakers and Mennonites were small but maintained their opposition to military service. Many young members, such as [[Richard Nixon]] voluntarily joining the military. Unlike in 1917\u20131918, the positions were generally respected by the government, which set up non-combat civilian roles for [[conscientious objectors]]. Typically, church members sent their sons into the military without protest, accepted shortages and rationing as a war necessity, purchased war bonds, working munitions industries, and prayed intensely for safe return and for victory. Church leaders, however, were much more cautious while holding fast to the ideals of peace, justice and humanitarianism, and sometimes criticizing military policies such as the bombing of enemy cities. They sponsored 10,000 military chaplains, and set up special ministries in and around military bases, focused not only on soldiers but their young wives who often followed them. The mainstream Protestant churches supported the \"[[Double V campaign]]\" of the black churches to achieve victory against the enemies abroad, and victory against racism on the home front. However, there was little religious protest against the incarceration of Japanese on the West Coast or against segregation of Blacks in the services. The intense moral outrage regarding the Holocaust largely appeared after the war ended, especially after 1960. Many church leaders supported studies of postwar peace proposals, typified by [[John Foster Dulles]], a leading Protestant layman and a leading adviser to top-level Republicans. The churches promoted strong support for European relief programs, especially through the United Nations.<ref> John  P.

United States]]''  a Supreme Court decision in 1892  Justice [[David Josiah Brewer]] used the opportunity to present his personal views on the nation's religious base and concluded it was \"a Christian nation\". He later wrote and lectured widely on the topic, stressing that \"Christian nation\" was an informal designation and not a legal standard, :\n:[In] American life, as expressed by its laws, its business, its customs, and its society, we find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth. Among other matters, note the following: the form of oath universally prevailing, concluding with an appeal to the Almighty; the custom of opening sessions of all deliberative bodies and most conventions with prayer; the prefatory words of all wills, \"In the name of God, amen\"; the laws respecting the observance of the Sabbath, with the general cessation of all secular business, and the closing of courts, legislatures, and other similar public assemblies on that day; the churches and church organizations which abound in every city, town, and hamlet; the multitude of charitable organizations existing everywhere under Christian auspices; the gigantic missionary associations, with general support, and aiming to establish Christian missions in every quarter of the globe. These, and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation....There is no dissonance in these declarations. There is a universal language pervading them all, having one meaning. They affirm and reaffirm that this is a religious nation. These are not individual sayings, declarations of private persons.

Smith said he had a series of visions, [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelations]] from God and visitations from [[Angel#Latter-day Saint beliefs|angelic messengers]], providing him with ongoing instructions as [[prophet, seer, and revelator]] and a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restorer]] of the original and primary doctrines of [[early Christianity]].  After publishing the [[Book of Mormon]]\u2014which he said he translated by divine power from a record of ancient American prophets recorded on [[golden plates]]\u2014Smith organized the \"[[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]]\" in 1830.  He set up a [[theocracy]] at Nauvoo Illinois, and ran for president of the United States in 1844.  His top aide [[Brigham Young]] campaigned for Smith saying, \"He it is that God of Heaven designs to save this nation from destruction and preserve the Constitution.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth H.

Conflicts between Mormons and territorial federal appointees flared, included the [[Runaway Officials of 1851]]; this eventually led to the small-scale [[Utah War]] of 1857\u20131858, after which Utah remained occupied by Federal troops until 1861.\n\nCongress passed the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]] of 1862 to curb the Mormon practice of [[polygamy]] in the territory, but President [[Abraham Lincoln]] did not enforce this law; instead Lincoln gave Brigham Young [[wiktionary:tacit|tacit]] permission to ignore the act in exchange for not becoming involved with the [[American Civil War]].<ref name= Zion-courts>{{citation |last1= Firmage |first1= Edwin Brown |last2= Mangrum |first2= Richard Collin |title= Zion in the courts |year= 2001 |publisher= University of Illinois Press |isbn= 978-0-252-06980-2 |page= 139 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=9AimifP2a-4C |quote= Having signed the Morrill Act, Abraham Lincoln reportedly compared the LDS Church to a log he had encountered as a farmer that was 'too hard to split, too wet to burn and too heavy to move, so we plow around it.

This law also revoked polygamists' right to vote, made them ineligible for jury service, and prohibited them from holding political office.  The subsequent 1887 [[Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act]] disincorporated the LDS Church and confiscated church assets. It also: required an anti-polygamy oath for prospective voters, jurors and public officials; mandated civil marriage licenses; disallowed [[spousal privilege]] to not testify in polygamy cases; disenfranchised women; replaced local judges with federally appointed judges; and removed local control of schools. After a [[Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States|1890 Supreme Court ruling]] found the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act constitutional, and with most church leadership either in hiding or imprisoned, the church released the [[1890 Manifesto]] which advised church members against entering legally prohibited marriages. Dissenters moved to Canada or [[Mormon colonies in Mexico]], or into hiding in remote areas. With the polygamy issue resolved, church leaders were pardoned or had their sentences reduced, assets were restored to the church, and Utah was eventually granted statehood in 1896. After the [[Reed Smoot hearings]] began in 1904, a [[Second Manifesto]] was issued which specified that anyone entering into or solemnizing polygamous marriages would be excommunicated, and clarified that polygamy restrictions applied everywhere, and not just in the United States.<ref>Kathleen Flake, ''The Politics of American Religious Identity: The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot, Mormon Apostle'' (2004)</ref>\n\nThanks to worldwide [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary work]], the church grew from 7.7 million members worldwide in 1989 to 14 million in 2010.<ref>{{cite book|author=Matthew Bowman|title=The Mormon People: The Making of an American Faith|publisher=Random House|url=https://archive.org/details/mormonpeoplemaki00bowm_0|url-access=registration|year=2012|page=[https://archive.org/details/mormonpeoplemaki00bowm_0/page/218 218]|isbn=9780812983364}}</ref>\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\n{{main article|History of Jehovah's Witnesses}}\n\n[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] comprise a fast-growing denomination that has kept itself separate from other Christian denominations. It began in 1872 with [[Charles Taze Russell]], but experienced a major schism in 1917 as [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]] began his presidency. Rutherford gave new direction to the movement and renamed the movement \"Jehovah's witnesses\"<!--lower case \"w\" is correct--> in 1931.  The period from 1925 to 1933 saw many significant changes in doctrine. Attendance at their yearly [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Memorial of Christ's death|Memorial]] dropped from a high of 90,434 in 1925 to 63,146 in 1935.  Since 1950 growth has been very rapid.<ref>Stark et al., \"Why Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Grow So Rapidly: A Theoretical Application,\"  [[Journal of Contemporary Religion]],'' Vol. 12, # 2, 1997: 133\u2013157</ref>\n\nDuring the World War II, Jehovah's Witnesses experienced mob attacks in America and were temporarily banned in Canada and Australia because of their lack of support for the war effort. They won significant Supreme Court victories involving the rights of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] and [[Freedom of religion|religion]] that have had a great impact on legal interpretation of these rights for others.<ref>Patrick J.

Accounts of miraculous healing are common within the church, and adherents often refuse traditional medical treatments.  Legal troubles sometimes result when they forbid medical treatment of their children.<ref>Stephen Gottschalk, ''The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life'' 1973)</ref>\n\nThe Church is unique among American denominations in several ways.  It is highly centralized, with all the local churches merely branches of the mother church in Boston. There are no ministers, but there are practitioners who are integral to the movement. The practitioners operate local businesses that help members heal their illnesses by the power of the mind. They depend for their clientele on the approval of the Church. Starting in the late 19th century the Church has rapidly lost membership, although it does not publish statistics. Its flagship newspaper ''Christian Science Monitor'' lost most of its subscribers and dropped its paper version to become an online source.<ref>Stephen Gottschalk, \"Christian Science Polity in Crisis,\" ''The Christian Century'' Volume: 110.

In 1995, it renounced its 1845 origins in the defense of slavery and racial superiority.\n* [[Unitarian Universalism]] - a theologically liberal religious movement founded in 1961 from the union of the well established [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and [[Universalist]] churches.\n* [[United Church of Christ]] - formed in 1957 as a [[united and uniting churches|united and uniting]] church from a merger of the [[Congregational Christian Church]] and [[Evangelical and Reformed Church]]. Congregations participating in the merger descended from Congregationalist churches of New England, German Lutheran and Reformed Churches largely from the Midwest, and various of [[Campbellite]], [[Christian Connection|Christian Connexion]] and [[Christians (Stone Movement)|\"Christian\"]] churches. \n* [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]] - founded in 1810 in [[Dickson County, Tennessee]] by [[Samuel McAdow]], [[Finis Ewing]], and [[Samuel King (minister)|Samuel King]].\n\n==Benevolent and missionary societies==\n[[Benevolent society|Benevolent societies]] were an extremely new and conspicuous feature of the American landscape during the first half of the 19th century. Originally devoted to the salvation of souls, they eventually focused on the eradication of every kind of social ill. Benevolent societies were the direct result of the extraordinary energies generated by the evangelical movement\u2014specifically, by the \"activism\" resulting from conversion. \"The evidence of God's grace,\" Presbyterian evangelist [[Charles Grandison Finney]] insisted, \"was a person's benevolence toward others.\"<ref>Dwight Burlingame, ed. ''Philanthropy in America: a comprehensive historical encyclopedia'' (2004)</ref>\n\nThe evangelical establishment used this powerful network of voluntary, ecumenical benevolent societies to Christianize the nation. The earliest and most important of these organizations focused their efforts on the conversion of sinners to the new birth or to the creation of conditions (such as sobriety sought by [[Temperance movement|temperance societies]]) in which conversions could occur. The six largest societies in 1826\u201327 were: the American Education Society, the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], the [[American Bible Society]], the [[American Sunday School Union]], the [[American Tract Society]], and the [[American Home Missionary Society]].\n\nMost denominations operated missions abroad (and some to Indians and Asians in the US).

Grant was determined to divide Native American post appointments \"up among the religious churches\"; by 1872, 73 Indian agencies were divided among religious denominations.<ref> Francis Paul Prucha, ''The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians'' (1984), pp. 501\u2013503.</ref> A core policy was to put the western reservations under the control of religious denominations.  In 1872, of the 73 agencies assigned, the Methodists received 14 reservations; the Orthodox Quakers ten; the Presbyterians nine; the Episcopalians eight; the Catholics seven; the Hicksite Quakers  six; the Baptists five; the Dutch Reformed five; the Congregationalists three; the Disciples two; Unitarians two; [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] one; and Lutherans one. The selection criteria were vague and some critics saw the Peace Policy as violating Native American freedom of religion. Catholics wanted a bigger role and set up the [[Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions]] in 1874. The Peace Policy remained in force until 1881.<ref>Francis Paul Prucha, ''American Indian Policy in Crisis, Christian Reformers and the Indian, 1865\u20131900'' (2014) pp. 30\u201371.</ref>  Historian Cary Collins says Grant's Peace Policy, failed in the Pacific Northwest chiefly because of sectarian competition and the priority placed on proselytizing by the religious denominations.<ref>Cary C.

From 1886 to 1926 the most active recruiting agency was the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions (SVM), which used its base on campus YMCAs to appeal to enlist over 8,000 young Protestants. The idea quickly was copied by the new World's Student Christian Federation (WSCF), with strength in  Great Britain, and Europe, and even as far as Australia, India, China and Japan.

Mott explained about China in 1910:\n:It is Western education that the Chinese are clamoring for, and will have. If the Church can give it to them, plus Christianity, they will take it; otherwise they will get it elsewhere, without Christianity\u2014and that speedily.

The Commission's report, ''Re-Thinking Missions: A Laymen's Inquiry After One Hundred Years'' (1932) and known as the \"Hocking report,\" reflected changing ideas about the wisdom of a reduced role for western missionaries. It generated fierce debate. Commission members traveled to Asian cities to meet missionaries and local people. While in China, Hocking consulted with the famous writer [[Pearl S.

In the Thirteen colonies, Catholicism was introduced with the settling of [[Maryland]] in 1634; this colony offered a rare example of [[religious toleration]] in a fairly intolerant age. Maryland law remained a major center, as exemplified by the pre-eminence of the Archdiocese of Baltimore in Catholic circles. However, at the time of the [[American Revolution]], Catholics formed less than one percent of the white population of the thirteen states.<ref>In his report on the state of Catholicism, [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] in 1785 estimated the Catholic population in the 13 states was 25,000; the 1790 Census counted four million Americans.

''The religious history of America'' (2002) p. 100</ref>  Religiously, the Catholics were characterized by personalism, discipline, and a prayer life that was essentially personal, demanding only a small role for priests and none for bishops.  Ritualism was important, and focused on daily prayers, Sunday Mass, and observance of two dozen holy days.<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience: A History from Colonial Times to the Present'' (1985) p. 94</ref>\n\nThe main source of Catholics in the United States was the huge numbers of European immigrants of the 19th and 20th centuries, especially from Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Poland. Recently, most Catholic immigrants come from [[Latin America]], especially from Mexico.<ref>James Terence Fisher, ''Communion of Immigrants: A History of Catholics in America'' (2002)</ref>\n\nThe [[Irish Americans|Irish]] came to dominate the church, providing most of the bishops, college presidents and lay leaders.

Hennesey, ''American Catholics: A History of the Roman Catholic Community in the United States'' (1983)</ref>\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, the first attempt at standardizing discipline in the church occurred with the convocation of the [[Plenary Councils of Baltimore]]. These councils resulted in the [[Baltimore Catechism]] and the establishment of [[The Catholic University of America]].<ref>James M. O'Toole, et al. ''The Faithful: A History of Catholics in America'' (2009)</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s the church went through dramatic changes, especially in the liturgy and the use of the language of the people instead of Latin.  The number of priests and nuns declined sharply as few entered and many left their vocations. Since 1990 scandals involving the coverup by bishops of priests who sexually abused young men has led to massive financial payments across the country\u2014and indeed in Europe as well.\n\n==Eastern Orthodoxy==\n{{Main article|History of the Eastern Orthodox Church in North America|Timeline of Eastern Orthodoxy in America}}\n\nEastern Orthodoxy spread to the North American continent with the founding of [[Russian America]], in what is today the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[Alaska]].

In social terms the [[American Jews|Jewish]] ethnic community began with small groups of merchants in colonial ports such as [[New York City]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. In the mid- and late-19th century well-educated German Jews arrived and settled in towns and cities across the United States, especially as dry goods merchants. From 1880 to 1924 large numbers of Yiddish-speaking Jews arrived from [[Eastern Europe]], settling in New York City and other large cities. After 1926 numbers came as refugees from Europe; after 1980 many came from the [[Soviet Union]], and there has been a flow from [[Israel]]. [[Historical Jewish population comparisons|By the year 1900]] the 1.5 million Jews residing in the United States were the third most of any nation, behind Russia and [[Austria-Hungary]]. The proportion of the population has been about 2% to 3% since 1900, and in the 21st century Jews were widely diffused in major metropolitan areas around New York or the [[Northeastern United States]], and especially in [[South Florida]] and [[California]].<ref>Hasia Diner, ''The Jews of the United States, 1654\u20132000'' (2006)</ref><ref>Jonathan D.

Despite a common background, the groups' views on broader [[religious toleration]] were mixed. While some notable examples such as [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] of [[Rhode Island]] and [[William Penn]] ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies, others such as the [[Plymouth Colony]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] had established churches. The Dutch colony of the [[New Netherlands]] had also established the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] and outlawed all other worship, although enforcement by the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the last years of the colony was sparse.  Part of the reason for establishment was financial: the established Church was responsible for [[poor relief]], and dissenting churches would therefore have a significant advantage.\n\nThere were also opponents to the support of any established church even at the state level.  In 1773, [[Isaac Backus]], a prominent Baptist minister in [[New England]], observed that when \"church and state are separate, the effects are happy, and they do not at all interfere with each other: but where they have been confounded together, no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued.\"  Thomas Jefferson's influential [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] was enacted in 1786, five years before the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].\n\nMost Anglican ministers, and many Anglicans outside the South, were [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]. The Anglican Church was disestablished during the Revolution, and following the separation from Britain was reorganized as the independent [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].\n\n===Establishment Clause===\nThe [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] reads, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .\" In a letter written in 1802, [[Thomas Jefferson]] used the phrase \"[[separation of church and state]]\" to describe the combined effect of the Establishment Clause and the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]]. Though \"separation of church and state\" does not appear in the Constitution, it has since been quoted in several opinions handed down by the [[United States Supreme Court]].<ref>Jefferson's Danbury letter has been cited favorably by the Supreme Court many times. In its 1879 [[Reynolds v. United States]] decision the high court said Jefferson's observations 'may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [First] Amendment.' In the court's 1947 [[Everson v. Board of Education]] decision, Justice [[Hugo Black]] wrote, 'In the words of Thomas Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state.'</ref>\n\n[[Robert N. Bellah]] has argued in his writings that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the United States, this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the United States. He used the term [[Civil Religion]] to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the United States. His 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of [[John F. Kennedy]]: ''\"Considering the separation of church and state, how is a president justified in using the word 'God' at all? The answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension.\"<ref>{{Cite journal\n| first =Robert Neelly\n| last =Bellah\n| authorlink =Robert N.

There are allegations of [[discrimination against atheists]] in the United States.\n\n====Jefferson, Madison, and the \"wall of separation\"====\nThe phrase a \"hedge or ''wall of separation'' between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world\" was first used by Baptist theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], the founder of the colony of Rhode Island.<ref>Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. p. 24 (\"Williams's metaphor was rediscovered by [[Isaac Backus]], a New England Baptist of Jefferson's generation, who believed, like Williams, that an established church\u2014which he considered to exist in the Massachusetts of his day\u2014would never protect religious dissenters like himself and must be opposed in order to keep religion pure.\")</ref>  It was later used by Jefferson as a commentary on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government, in an 1802 letter.\n\nJefferson's and Madison's conceptions of ''separation'' have long been debated.  Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia and vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment.\n\nAfter retiring from the presidency, Madison argued in his detached memoranda<ref>[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions64.html James Madison's Detached Memoranda]</ref> for a stronger separation of church and state, opposing the very presidential issuing of religious proclamations he himself had done, and also opposing the appointment of chaplains to Congress.\n\nJefferson's opponents said his position meant the rejection of Christianity, but this was a caricature. In setting up the University of Virginia, Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own, though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity, arising from his own [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]].<ref>Dumas Malone, ''Jefferson and his Times'' 6:393</ref>\n\n====Test acts====\n{{main article|No religious test clause}}\nThe absence of an establishment of religion did not necessarily imply that all men were free to hold office. Most colonies had a [[Test Act]], and several states retained them for a short time.  This stood in contrast to the Federal Constitution, which explicitly prohibits the employment of any religious test for Federal office, and which through the Fourteenth Amendment later extended this prohibition to the States.<ref>Bradley, Gerard V. \"No Religious Test Clause and the Constitution of Religious Liberty: A Machine That Has Gone of Itself, The.\" ''Case Western Reserve Law Review'' 37 (1986): 674. [http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1066&context=law_faculty_scholarship online]</ref>\n\n[[Article Six of the United States Constitution]] provides that  \"no [[religious test|religious Test]] shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States\".  Prior to the inclusion of the Bill of Rights, this was the only mention of religious freedom in the Constitution.\n\n===First Amendment===\nThe first amendment to the US Constitution states \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\" The two parts, known as the \"establishment clause\" and the \"free exercise clause\" respectively, form the textual basis for the Supreme Court's interpretations of the \"separation of church and state\" doctrine.\n\nOn August 15, 1789 Madison said, \"he apprehended the meaning of the words to be, that Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law, nor compel men to worship God in any manner contrary to their conscience....\u201d<ref>[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions53.html The Founders' Constitution]\nVolume 5, Amendment I (Religion), Document 53.  The University of Chicago Press, retrieved 8/9/07.</ref>\n\nAll states disestablished religion by 1833; Massachusetts was the last state. This ended the practice of allocating taxes to churches.\n\n===Supreme Court since 1947===\n{{Main|School prayer#United States}}\nThe phrase ''\"separation of church and state\"'' became a definitive part of Establishment Clause [[jurisprudence]] in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'', 330 U.S. 1 (1947), a case that dealt with a state law that allowed government funds for transportation to religious schools.  While the ruling upheld the state law allowing taxpayer funding of transportation to religious schools as constitutional, ''Everson'' was also the first case to hold the Establishment Clause applicable to the state legislatures as well as Congress, based upon the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref name=\"Jonathan A. Wright 2010\">Jonathan A. Wright, ''Separation of Church and State'' (2010)</ref>\n\nIn 1949 Bible reading was a part of routine in the public schools of at least thirty-seven states. In twelve of these states, Bible reading was legally required by state laws; 11 states passed these laws after 1913. In 1960, 42 per cent of school districts nationwide tolerated or required Bible reading, and 50 per cent reported some form of homeroom daily devotional exercise. <ref>Adam Laats, \"Our schools, our country: American evangelicals, public schools, and the Supreme Court decisions of 1962 and 1963.\" ''Journal of religious history'' 36.3 (2012): 319-334 at p 321-22.</ref>\n\nSince 1962, the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that prayers organized by public school officials schools are unconstitutional. Students are allowed to pray privately, and to join religious clubs after school hours. Colleges, universities, and private schools are not affected by the Supreme Court rulings.  Reactions to ''Engel'' and ''Abington'' were widely negative, with over 150 constitutional amendments submitted to reverse the policy. None passed Congress.<ref>Geoffrey R. Stone, \"In Opposition to the School Prayer Amendment.\" ''University of Chicago Law Review'' 50 (1983): 823-848.  [http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4338&context=uclrev online].</ref>  It is a matter of the government promoting an establishment of religion. The Supreme Court has also ruled that so-called \"voluntary\" school prayers are also unconstitutional, because they force some students to be outsiders to the main group, and because they subject dissenters to intense peer group pressure. In [[Lee v. Weisman]] The Supreme Court held in 1992:\n:the State may not place the student dissenter in the dilemma of participating or protesting. Since adolescents are often susceptible to peer pressure, especially in matters of social convention, the State may no more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use direct means. The embarrassment and intrusion of the religious exercise cannot be refuted by arguing that the prayers are of a de minimis character, since that is an affront to ...those for whom the prayers have meaning, and since any intrusion was both real and a violation of the objectors' rights.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Palestini |author2=Karen Palestini Falk|title=Law and American Education: An Instructor's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhP3CT4P2-AC&pg=PA33|year=2002|publisher=R&L Education|page=33|isbn=9781461731634}}</ref><ref>505 U.S. 577, Syllabus.</ref>\n\nIn 1962, the Supreme Court extended this analysis to the issue of prayer in public schools.  In [[Engel v. Vitale]] 370 U.S. 421 (1962), the Court determined it unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools, even when it is non-denominational and students may excuse themselves from participation.  As such, any teacher, faculty, or student can pray in school, in accordance with their own religion.  However, they may not lead such prayers in class, or in other \"official\" school settings such as assemblies or programs.\n\nCurrently, the Supreme Court applies a three-pronged test to determine whether legislation comports with the Establishment Clause, known as the \"[[Lemon Test]]\". First, the legislature must have adopted the law with a neutral or non-religious purpose. Second, the statute's principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Third, the statute must not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion.<ref name=\"Jonathan A.

[http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/StaffCorps/Pages/CivilEngineerCorps(CEC).aspx] Several Civil Engineer Corps officers, primarily those serving during or around the time of World War 2, have held the rank of Vice Admiral, and one officer has held the 4 star rank of Admiral, but there are no current billets within the US Navy that require Civil Engineer Corps officers of either rank.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:CEC Insignia.jpg|thumb|WWII Naval Officers from the Civil Engineer Corps, Medical Corps, Dental Corps and Supply Corps assigned to Naval Construction Battalions had a Silver Seabee on their Corps insignia. ]]\n[[File:U.S. Naval insignia per USMC regulation.jpg|thumb|U.S. Naval insignia, brass subdued per USMC regulation for officers in CBs transferred to the Corps.]]\n\n\nCivil engineers were employed by the Navy Department as early as 1827, when Mr. Loammi Baldwin was appointed to superintendent of the construction of dry docks at Boston and Norfolk.<ref name= \"CEC\"/> Prior to the passage of the Act of 2 March 1867 civil engineers were appointed by the Secretary, but under authority of that act they were to be commissioned by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; they were appropriated for as part of the civil establishment at the several navy yards and stations under the control of the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] until 1870.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   At that time their pay was regulated by section 3 of the Act of 15 July, 1870 that  \"fixed\" the annual pay of officers of the Navy on the active list.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   Appropriations for their pay have been made since 1870 under the head of \"Pay of the Navy\".\n\nThe discretionary authority given to the President by the Statute of 3 March 1871, to determine and fix the relative rank of civil engineers was not exercised until the 24th of February 1881, when relative rank was conferred upon them and fixed as follows: One with the relative rank of captain ([[Captain (United States)|CAPT]]), two with that of commander ([[Commander|CDR]]), three with that of lieutenant-commander ([[lieutenant commander|LCDR]]), and four with that of lieutenant ([[lieutenant|LT]]).<ref name= \"CEC\"/>\n\nThe Navy Regulations for 1876 failed to list civil engineers among the staff officers of the Navy, and the uniform regulations for that year did not prescribe a uniform or a corps device for that class of officer. In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, which is a distinguishing mark of the line - with the following distinctive marks and devices instead of those worn by other officers:\n\n\"The sleeve lace to be on light blue velvet.\n\n\"Shoulder straps - border embroidered gold, body light blue cloth and the letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.\n\n\"The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\"\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two live oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps in lieu of the Old English letters C.E., and worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by the enlisted sailors, pay grades of E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N. Laycock discussing his modular pontoon box system with Admiral Moreell.]]\nBesides providing the command leadership and engineering skills needed by the Naval Construction Force(NCF), the CEC made a major contribution to the war effort.

It's purpose was to enable the Marines to land on Tinian's beaches bordered by coral embankments up to 15 feet high.  Ten LVTs were modified using beams salvaged from a sugar factory on Saipan.  The  commanding  Marine General was skeptical of the design.  He ordered that a tank test one a hundred times before he would use it it combat.  The ramps not only stood up, but they allowed the Marines land where there were no defenses as a landing there had been  thought impossible.  So, the astonished Japanese were completely outflanked due to CEC engineering.\n\n===Naval Combat Demolition Units===\nOperational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. was the very first USN \"demolitions\" unit.  In early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) [[Solomons, Maryland]] with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six Officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from NTC Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course.

He heard that Admiral Turner was interested in blasting coral and made contact.  The Admiral commissioned Lt.

Crist had gotten 30 officers and 150  enlisted together when the disaster at [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] happened.  With [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] the next operation Lt. Crist's 180 men were used to form UDT 1 and UDT 2.  Cmdr. E.D. Brewster (CEC) was selected to command UDT 1 and UDT 2 had  Lt. Crist.

In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, which is a distinguishing mark of the line - with the following distinctive marks and devices instead of those worn by other officers:\n\n\"The sleeve lace to be on light blue velvet.\n\n\"Shoulder straps - border embroidered gold, body light blue cloth and the letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.\n\n\"The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\"\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two live oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps in lieu of the Old English letters C.E., and worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by the enlisted sailors, pay grades of E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N. Laycock discussing his modular pontoon box system with Admiral Moreell.]]\nBesides providing the command leadership and engineering skills needed by the Naval Construction Force(NCF), the CEC made a major contribution to the war effort.

It's purpose was to enable the Marines to land on Tinian's beaches bordered by coral embankments up to 15 feet high.  Ten LVTs were modified using beams salvaged from a sugar factory on Saipan.  The  commanding  Marine General was skeptical of the design.  He ordered that a tank test one a hundred times before he would use it it combat.  The ramps not only stood up, but they allowed the Marines land where there were no defenses as a landing there had been  thought impossible.  So, the astonished Japanese were completely outflanked due to CEC engineering.\n\n===Naval Combat Demolition Units===\nOperational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. was the very first USN \"demolitions\" unit.  In early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) [[Solomons, Maryland]] with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six Officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from NTC Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course.

He heard that Admiral Turner was interested in blasting coral and made contact.  The Admiral commissioned Lt.

Crist had gotten 30 officers and 150  enlisted together when the disaster at [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] happened.  With [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] the next operation Lt. Crist's 180 men were used to form UDT 1 and UDT 2.  Cmdr. E.D. Brewster (CEC) was selected to command UDT 1 and UDT 2 had  Lt. Crist.
