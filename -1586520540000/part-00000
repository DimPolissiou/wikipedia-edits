Its purpose was to carry the Railway Line across Knapsack Gully. It formed part of the Zig Zag, which climbed the eastern escarpment from Emu Plains to today's Glenbrook. Whitton also designed and built The Victoria Bridge across the Nepean River at Penrith. \n[[File:Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone (2886372648).jpg|thumb|View From Emu Plains, New South Wales]]\nConstruction of the Knapsack Gully Viaduct started in March 1863 by contractor W. Watkins, who also completed the stone piers of the Victoria Bridge at Penrith. Work was completed in 1865, with the bridge being constructed from local sandstone quarried in the neighbourhood around [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]], and carried a single rail line.\n\nThe viaduct fell into disuse in 1913 after the completion of the Glenbrook Gorge Deviation. In 1926, after over a decade of disuse, the Knapsack Viaduct was taken over by the Main Roads Board. The board sort to improve the route of the Great Western Highway between [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]] and [[Blaxland, New South Wales|Blaxland]], that at the time zig zagged up what is today Old Bathurst Road. The viaduct's carriageway was widened to allow for two car lanes, by trimming back the inside face of the stone parapets. The new road was opened by Governor Sir Dudley DeChair on 23 October 1926. The viaduct was again widened in 1939, with the construction of a reinforced concrete cantilevered deck, because of increased traffic use.\n\nThe final deviation of the [[Great Western Highway]], with the opening of the [[M4 Western Motorway|M4]] finally ended traffic flow across the Knapsack Viaduct in 1993. In 1995 the Viaduct was reopened to the public as part of the historic Lapstone Zig Zag walk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4301012|title=Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone {{!}} NSW Environment & Heritage|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nThe line of the old track and cuttings (including the long abandoned platform of Lucasville station), and the old Knapsack Gully bridge is now a popular [[bushwalking]] track.<ref name=\"walks1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/glenbrook-eastern-blue-mountains/lapstone-bridge-zigzig-walk.html |title=Wildwalks |location=AU-NS |publisher=Wildwalks |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> Often a cacophony of [[Bird vocalization|birdsong]] and insects can be heard where the gully is deep at the viaduct and it would tend to echo these sounds, especially that of the [[bell miner]].

In 1995 the Viaduct was reopened to the public as part of the historic Lapstone Zig Zag walk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4301012|title=Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone {{!}} NSW Environment & Heritage|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nThe line of the old track and cuttings (including the long abandoned platform of Lucasville station), and the old Knapsack Gully bridge is now a popular [[bushwalking]] track.<ref name=\"walks1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/glenbrook-eastern-blue-mountains/lapstone-bridge-zigzig-walk.html |title=Wildwalks |location=AU-NS |publisher=Wildwalks |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> Often a cacophony of [[Bird vocalization|birdsong]] and insects can be heard where the gully is deep at the viaduct and it would tend to echo these sounds, especially that of the [[bell miner]].

Netzer was on the bench, but the Borussia fans demanded he be substituted on. Cameras were trained on him, watching his every movement. During the entire first half, spectators at the Rheinstadion demanded to see Netzer subbed in. At half-time Weisweiler wanted to substitute Netzer on, but he rejected this, saying, \"better that it not be me\".<ref name=\"abschied\" />\n\nIn the 58th minute, Gladbach attacker [[Jupp Heynckes]] was fouled by [[Jupp Kapellmann]] inside the box, and referee [[Kurt Tschenscher]] awarded a penalty. Contrary to the old football rule, Heynckes himself took the penalty, and saw it saved by K\u00f6ln goalkeeper [[Gerhard Welz]]. Protests that Welz had moved too early were dismissed by the referee. Further into the second half, K\u00f6ln twice hit the crossbar via [[J\u00fcrgen Glowacz]] in the 67th minute and [[Heinz Flohe]] in the 81st minutes. In the 86th minute, a shot by Gladbach's Heynckes also hit the woodwork. However, at the end of 90 minutes the score remained level at 1\u20131, and extra time was required.<ref>Dino Reisner: DFB-Pokal: Tore, Dramen, Sensationen aus 60 Jahren Spitzenfu\u00dfball, Stiebner Verlag GmbH, 2011,[https://books.google.com/books?id=uRcEZcNJE2wC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=Heynckes+welz+elfmeter&source=bl&ots=pT4BIwtSsJ&sig=8R_MIx9NtSGoQtVCwwnZTviEyZY&hl=de&sa=X&ei=smF_Up_hIIjPtAay9oG4Cg&ved=0CF8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Heynckes%20welz%20elfmeter&f=false S. 63]</ref>\n\nAs the game went to extra time, Netzer spoke to the exhausted [[Christian Kulik]], asking whether he still felt fit.

At the same time Netzer had to admit internally that the decision was justified due to concerns over his fitness.<ref name=\"wz\"/> For his replacement, Weisweiler brought on [[Herbert Wimmer]] as central midfielder and team captain.\n\n1. FC K\u00f6ln had made the cup final thrice in the previous five seasons, winning once, and went into the match as a slight favourites.<ref name=\"einestage\">[http://einestages.spiegel.de/s/ab/28630/dfb-pokalfinale-1973-als-sich-netzer-unsterblich-machte.html Als Netzer sich unsterblich machte] auf einestages.de</ref>\n\n==Route to the final==\nThe DFB-Pokal began with 32 teams in a [[Two-legged tie|two-legged]] knockout cup competition. There were a total of four rounds leading up to the final. Teams were drawn against each other, and following two legs of 90 minutes each, the winner on [[Playoff format#Total points series (aggregate)|aggregate]] would advance. If still tied, 30 minutes of [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] was played. If the score was still level, a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] was used to determine the winner.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dfb.de/dfb-pokal/modus/ |title=Modus |trans-title=Mode |website=dfb.de |publisher=[[German Football Association]] |date=15 August 2012 |access-date=11 June 2015 |language=German}}</ref>\n\n''Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]]\n!

Netzer was on the bench, but the Borussia fans demanded he be substituted on. Cameras were trained on him, watching his every movement. During the entire first half, spectators at the Rheinstadion demanded to see Netzer subbed in. At half-time Weisweiler wanted to substitute Netzer on, but he rejected this, saying, \"better that it not be me\".<ref name=\"abschied\" />\n\nIn the 58th minute, Gladbach attacker [[Jupp Heynckes]] was fouled by [[Jupp Kapellmann]] inside the box, and referee [[Kurt Tschenscher]] awarded a penalty. Contrary to the old football rule, Heynckes himself took the penalty, and saw it saved by K\u00f6ln goalkeeper [[Gerhard Welz]]. Protests that Welz had moved too early were dismissed by the referee. Further into the second half, K\u00f6ln twice hit the crossbar via [[J\u00fcrgen Glowacz]] in the 67th minute and [[Heinz Flohe]] in the 81st minutes. In the 86th minute, a shot by Gladbach's Heynckes also hit the woodwork. However, at the end of 90 minutes the score remained level at 1\u20131, and extra time was required.<ref>Dino Reisner: DFB-Pokal: Tore, Dramen, Sensationen aus 60 Jahren Spitzenfu\u00dfball, Stiebner Verlag GmbH, 2011,[https://books.google.com/books?id=uRcEZcNJE2wC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=Heynckes+welz+elfmeter&source=bl&ots=pT4BIwtSsJ&sig=8R_MIx9NtSGoQtVCwwnZTviEyZY&hl=de&sa=X&ei=smF_Up_hIIjPtAay9oG4Cg&ved=0CF8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Heynckes%20welz%20elfmeter&f=false S. 63]</ref>\n\nAs the game went to extra time, Netzer spoke to the exhausted [[Christian Kulik]], asking whether he still felt fit. Upon Kulik expressing doubt, Netzer took off his training jacket, went to Weisweiler, and informed him that he would be substituting himself in for Kulik, saying \"I'll play now then\".<ref name=\"wz\"/><ref name=\"kulik\"/>\n\nIn the 94th minute, minutes after his substition, Netzer scored what would be the winning goal with his second touch of the match following a wall pass with teammate [[Rainer Bonhof]].<ref name=\"yesterday\"/><ref name=\"wz\"/> Netzer later admitted that he took the ball \"completely wrong\" with the outer instep, thereby out of reach of the keeper Welz.<ref name=\"abschied\"/> He called it \"the luckiest moment of my football career\", because it was \"meant\" to go awry.<ref>[http://dfbpokal-walkoffame.de/pokalheld/guenter-netzer/ ''Er spielte doch''.] dfbpokal-walkoffame.de</ref> His winning goal was later voted [[Goal of the Month (Germany)|Goal of the Month]] for June 1971 and [[Goal of the Year (Germany)|Goal of the Year]] for 1971.<ref>{{cite web | title = Die zehn wichtigsten Pokalfinals aller Zeiten | publisher = sportal.de | date = 18 April 2008 | accessdate = 7 October 2008 | url = http://www.sportal.de/sportal/generated/article/fussball/2008/04/18/9312100000.html | language = German | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723001646/http://www.sportal.de/sportal/generated/article/fussball/2008/04/18/9312100000.html | archive-date = 23 July 2011 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Details===\n<onlyinclude>{{Football box\n|date       = {{Start date|1973|6|23|df=y}}\n|time       = 16:00 [[Central European Time|CET]]\n|team1      = [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]]\n|score      = 2\u20131\n|aet        = yes\n|report     = https://www.dfb.de/dfb-pokal/spieltag/?spieledb_path=%2Fmatches%2F562427\n|team2      = [[1.

They serve a multitude of functions{{mdash}}including climbing, digging, and fighting{{mdash}}and have undergone numerous adaptive changes in different animal [[Taxon|taxa]]. Claws are pointed at their ends and are composed of two layers: a thick, deep layer and a superficial, hardened layer which serves a protective function. The underlying bone is a virtual mold of the overlying horny structure and therefore has the same shape as the claw or nail. Compared to claws, nails are flat, less curved, and do not extend far beyond the tip of the digits. The ends of the nails usually consist only of the \"superficial\", hardened layer and are not pointed like claws.<ref name=\"Ankel-Simons-342\" /><!-- ref for para -->\n\nWith only a few exceptions, primates retain [[plesiomorphic]] (original, \"primitive\") hands with five digits, each equipped with either a nail or a claw. For example, nearly all living [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] primates have nails on all digits except the second toe which is equipped with a [[grooming claw]]. [[Tarsier]]s have a grooming claw on second and third toes. Less commonly known, a grooming claw is also found on the second pedal digit of [[owl monkey]]s (''Aotus''), [[titi]]s (''Callicebus''), and possibly other [[New World monkey]]s.<ref name=Maiolino>{{Cite journal | last1 = Maiolino | first1 = S. | last2 = Boyer | first2 = D.

Bailey]] \u2013 '''14''' (14.14)\n}}\n\nThe '''1950\u201351 Ashes series''' consisted of five [[cricket]] [[Test cricket|Test matches]], each of six days with five hours play each day and [[Over (cricket)|eight ball overs]]. It formed part of the '''[[MCC tour of Australia in 1950\u201351]]''' and the matches outside the Tests were played in the name of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]]. The '''[[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England team]]''' under the captaincy of the big-hearted [[all-rounder]] [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] was regarded as the weakest sent to Australia and \"without [[Alec Bedser|Bedser]] and [[Len Hutton|Hutton]], [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] would have been little better than a [[Club cricket|club side]]\".<ref>p220, Kay</ref> Few gave them a chance of regaining [[the Ashes]] and they lost the series 4\u20131 to [[Lindsay Hassett]]'s '''[[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian team]]''', which had far greater reserves of talent. In the Fifth and final Test England beat Australia for the first time since 1938 and ended their unbeaten run of 14 Tests against England, 26 Tests against all teams and 96 games in all cricket since the [[Second World War]]. After this victory England would defeat Australia in [[Australian cricket team in England in 1953|1953]], [[1954\u201355 Ashes series|1954\u201355]] and [[Australian cricket team in England in 1956|1956]].\n\nIt was a great all round team effort from the Australians; the captain [[Lindsay Hassett]] made 366 runs (40.66), [[Neil Harvey]] 362 runs (40.22), [[Keith Miller]] 350 runs (43.75) and [[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]] 125 runs (41.66). The [[fast bowler]] [[Ray Lindwall]] took 15 wickets (22.93), his new-ball partner [[Keith Miller]] 17 wickets (17.70), [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] 22 wickets (19.18) and the mystery spin of [[Jack Iverson]] 21 wickets (15.23) in his only Test series. This was the first Ashes series to be played since the retirement of [[Don Bradman]] and it saw the debut of [[Ken Archer]], [[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]], [[Graeme Hole]] and [[Jack Iverson]] for [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] and [[John Warr]] and [[Roy Tattersall]] for England.\n\nDespite their defeat it was two English players who dominated the series; [[Len Hutton]] \"a [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] among the [[minnows]]\" made 533 runs (88.83) with an average double that of any other batsman, English or Australian.<ref>p 79, Swanton</ref> [[Alec Bedser]] took 30 wickets (16.06) and began his dominance of Australian batsmen that would continue into 1953, when he and Hutton would be instrumental in regaining the Ashes for England. The forty-year-old [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] had a successful series and won considerable popularity with his jovial determination to fight on regardless of the odds. Given the close results in the First and Second Tests it is possible that [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] could have won had [[Bill Edrich]] or [[Jim Laker]] been brought over, or [[Denis Compton]] had been fully fit. The [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] strokemaker had a chequered tour, averaging 7.57 in the Tests and 92.11 in his other First Class matches.\n\n==First Test \u2013 Brisbane==\n{{Test match |\ndate = 1\u20134 December 1950|\nteam1 = {{cr|Australia}}|\nteam2 = {{cr|England}}|\n\nscore-team1-inns1 = 228|\nruns-team1-inns1 = [[Neil Harvey|R.N.

Nobody seems to know why, and all sorts of arguments are ventilated for and against more cricket Tests on the [[The Gabba|Woolloongabba]] ground. I am all in favour of robbing Queensland of its greatest cricketing occasion, for the ground depresses. It is not a cricket ground at all. It is a [[concentration camp]]! Wire fences abound. Spectators are herded and sorted out into lots as though for all the world this was a slave market and not a game of cricket. The stands are of wood and filthy to sit on. The dining rooms are barns, without a touch of colour or a picture on the wall. Everywhere there is dust and dirt...The field is rough, although the wicket is usually a good one until it rains. Then it is a strip of turf with thousands of demons prancing up and down...at [[Brisbane]] only a [[Len Hutton|Hutton]] could stay, let alone score runs.''\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref>pp59-60, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSelection of the [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian team]] would seem to be a simple process as eight of its members were highly talented cricketers who almost picked themselves; [[Lindsay Hassett]], [[Arthur Morris]], [[Neil Harvey]], [[Don Tallon]], [[Keith Miller]], [[Ray Lindwall]], [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]], and [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]]. [[Don Tallon]] replaced [[Ron Saggers]] who had kept wicket on the tour of [[History of cricket in South Africa from 1945\u201346 to 1970|South Africa in 1949\u201350]], which Tallon had missed. [[Ray Lindwall]] had been dropped for the last Test in South Africa, his form suffering from a series of ailments, but was recalled to the team to replace [[Geff Noblet]]. Batsmen [[Jack Moroney]] and [[Sam Loxton]] kept their places, but leg-spinner [[Colin McCool]] was replaced by the 35-year-old debutant mystery spinner [[Jack Iverson]]. The task for the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] tour selectors was not quite so easy. The managers [[Michael Green (cricketer, born 1891)|Brigadier Michael Green]] and [[John Nash (cricket administrator)|John Nash]], captain [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]], vice-captain [[Denis Compton]] and [[History of English amateur cricket|senior professional]] [[Len Hutton]] kept most of the team from the Fourth and final Test against the [[West Indian national cricket team|West Indies]] in 1950. This was not the best recommendation as they had lost the series 3\u20131 and the last Test by an innings even though Hutton carried his bat for 202 out of 344. [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]], [[Denis Compton]], [[Len Hutton]], [[Reg Simpson]], [[John Dewes]], [[Trevor Bailey]], [[Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)|Arthur McIntyre]], [[Alec Bedser]], [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] all stayed, but the young opener [[David Sheppard]] was replaced by veteran [[Cyril Washbrook]] and [[Godfrey Evans]] returned as [[wicket-keeper]]. Apart from Hutton, Washbrook, Compton and Simpson the batsmen were not in fine form. Dewes was chosen after he had made a gritty 117 against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] in the last tour match before the Test. The reserve wicket-keeper [[Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)|Arthur McIntyre]] was in the team for his batting and as ''[[How Now Brown Cow|Brown's Cows]]'' were desperately short of good fielders and McIntyre had a good throwing arm.<ref>p19, O'Reilly</ref> While the crowd was waiting for the captains to come out and toss a dapper little man came out and inspected the pitch and he passed by the spectators completely unnoticed. It was the Test selector [[Sir Donald Bradman]], such is fame.<ref>p65, Fingleton</ref> [[Keith Miller]] had recently made a slow 201 not out against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] on the flat [[The Gabba|Woolloongabba]] pitch and predicted that the Test would be \"the dullest in history\".<ref>p69, Fingleton</ref> [[Lindsay Hassett]] won the toss (as he would 9 times out of 10 in Ashes Tests) and although the [[The Gabba|Woolloongabba Ground]] had a reputation as \"result\" wicket it looked plumb and he batted without hesitation.<ref>pp61-66, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp128-130, Kay</ref><ref>p18, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Australia \u2013 First Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''Seldom has an [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England cricket team]] gone into the field with the odds greater against them than did the side under Freddie Brown's command at Brisbane on the first day of December 1950. The tour had up to that date been one long succession of inglorious displays that had riled the critics without exception...it was no exaggeration to state that before the game began not one man in the crowd of 13,000 was prepared for the shocks that followed.''\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref>p128, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n''[[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Brown]] called his team together the night before the Test began. His first words were \"Chaps, you have got to get stuck into this with me. I have not lost faith. We can win if we go out there to-morrow and get stuck right into it.\" He told them that he knew they had not produced their English form. He told them that their batting, bowling, fielding and catching were too often just too bad to be true. Chosen, as they were, to represent their country, they obviously could do better. Brown's told them just what he thought of everything. He finished by saying that if they went on to the field on the morrow with confidence in themselves, they could do the job.''\n:[[Jack Fingleton]]<ref>p64, Fingleton</ref>\n</blockquote>\nOne of the good points about the tour so far had been the rise of [[Trevor Bailey]] as new ball partner for [[Alec Bedser]]. He bowled the first over, but mistimed his run up for the first ball and had to walk back and start again, swinging his fourth ball to tickle the edge of [[Jack Moroney]]'s bat and send it to [[Len Hutton]] at [[Fielding (cricket)|fine leg]] for a duck.\n\n[[Neil Harvey]] joined [[Arthur Morris]] and they took the score to 66/1 by lunch, though Morris constantly played and missed at Bedser's in-swingers and made only 24 runs to 38 by the more fluent Harvey. [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] (1/81) came on to bowl a typical over with two [[long hop]]s, which Harvey cracked into the square-leg fence, but the first ball of the next had him groping at a [[googly]] that turned so fiercely that it missed both bat and stumps, \"a real pearl that morally bowled Harvey all the way\".<ref>p26, O'Reilly</ref> The following ball had Wright appealing for [[leg before wicket|lbw]], but it was turned down as it turned so much that it would have missed the stumps.\n\nReturning after the break Bedser dismissed the labouring Morris [[leg before wicket|lbw]] to bring [[Keith Miller]] on at 69/2. [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England's]] fielding had dramatically improved over its reputation on tour \u2013 Bedser had bowled seven eight ball overs for 6 runs \u2013 but these two strokemakers increased the run rate much to the joy of the crowd. Miller hit a typical [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] over for 12 as he served up a mixture of [[full toss]]es, [[long hop]]s, googlies, fierce leg-breaks and cunningly flighted balls. Harvey's 50 with 6 boundaries brought a cheer from the crowd, and he hit 3 more, a cover-drive and a pull off Bedser and dancing three steps down the wicket to hit Wright to the sightscreen. The [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] spinner returned to the wicket with his [[Triple jump|hop, skip and a jump]] and bowled a [[googly]] that Miller mishit it to a surprised [[Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)|Arthur McIntyre]] at short mid-on to have him out for 15.\n\n[[Lindsay Hassett]] was almost out first ball to Bedser, but a difficult chance was missed by [[Denis Compton]] and the Australian captain took a single. Bedser then bowled one of his rare out-swingers to Neil Harvey, [[Godfrey Evans]] taking the catch and whipping off the bails to have the [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victorian]] left-hander [[caught]] and [[stumped]], but the bowler's umpire responded first and Harvey was \"c. Evans b. Bedser\" for 74.\n\nHassett did not survive long, his off-stump was knocked over by a Bedser \"special\" and from 116/2 [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] had collapsed to 129/5. [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] came on the relieve Bedser and Evans took another great catch to remove Loxton (24), though [[Ray Lindwall]] (41) saw Australia to tea for 166/6.\n\nBrown (2/63) continued after the break, mixing up his medium-paced seamers with leg-spin to have the out of form Australian wicket-keeper [[Don Tallon]] caught by [[Reg Simpson]] on the square leg boundary at 172/7.\n\nLindwall and [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] held things up for three-quarters of an hour while adding 47 before Bailey (3/28) took the new ball. Simpson caught Johnson off Bailey and Bedser took Lindwall to give Bailey his third wicket.\n\nBedser was brought back on and Bill Johnston flipped him over the slips to the boundary. As he came to a halt half way down the pitch he stopped to chat with [[Alec Bedser|Alec]] while Iverson completed two runs. Only now did Johnston realise that [[Reg Simpson]] had stopped the ball and was throwing it in to [[Godfrey Evans|Evans]]. He ran back towards his crease running like a duck trying to take off from water alongside Iverson making his third run. Johnston got home, Iverson stopped two yards short to turn back to the bowler's end, but Evans missed the bowler's stumps and he was safe.\n\nAfter this comedy routine Bedser (4/45) had [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] caught by Hutton in the slips to dismiss Australia for 228 ten minutes before stumps, the last 4 wickets falling for just 9 runs. This low score after Australia had chosen to bat on a good wicket was a coup for the touring team, whose performance surprised everyone, it now only remained to see how well their batsmen could perform.<ref>pp66-76, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp128-134, Kay</ref><ref>pp23-35, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===England \u2013 First Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''...the ball proceeded to perform capers all against the laws of [[gravitation]], and there came the craziest day's cricket imaginable, with twenty wickets falling for 130 runs and two [[Declaration and forfeiture|declarations]] that must surely be unique in the annuals of Test cricket.''\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref>p129, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOn the recommendation of an MCC committee member in Australia the tour selectors had decided to demote [[Len Hutton]] \u2013 the best opener in the world \u2013 to bat at number 5 so that he could stiffen the fragile lower order. This was possible as they had two other openers in [[Cyril Washbrook]] and [[Reg Simpson]] and Hutton declined to object as he was outvoted and did not want to appear obstinate. The two new openers went out to the middle on the first day, but Simpson successfully appealed for bad light and no ball was bowled. It rained on the Saturday morning and though it dried out on the rest day that followed more rain poured down overnight and play was suspended until the Monday afternoon. [[Keith Miller]] and [[Denis Compton]] took advantage of the situation by going to the local [[horse racing]] track, ringing the ground to check when play was to resume and dashing back just in time.<ref>p103, [[Keith Miller]], ''Cricket Crossfire'', Olbourne Press, 1956</ref>\n\nAlthough other First Class games had their pitches covered they were not for Test matches \u2013 a ruling that would change as a result of what was to follow. The pitch was reduced to a \"mudheap\", \"sticky dog\" or \"glue-pot\" so beloved by purists as only a batsman with classic technique could hope to play on it, in other words [[Len Hutton]]. The roller reduced the effects of the rain and Simpson (12) and Washbrook (19) added 28 for the first wicket while the going was good.\n\nThe wicket-keeper [[Godfrey Evans]] (16) was brought in as a [[nightwatchman (cricket)|\"daywatchman\"]] while the pitch dried out to normality. [[Ray Lindwall]] bowled only one over before being taken off and [[Keith Miller]] (2/29) and [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] (5/35) were brought on by Hassett to exploit the conditions with their part-time spin as England collapsed from 49/1 to 67/7 as good length balls leapt chest-high, shot along the ground, turned and straightened.\n\nBrown declared on 68/7, 160 runs behind, a move without precedent in Test cricket, but the England captain wanted to get the Australians onto the pitch before it dried out and became inhabitable. With hindsight he should have delayed as Hutton was still 8 not out and could have added some runs. As it was England was forced to bat again before stumps, but few captains anticipate getting Australia 32/7.<ref>pp75-83, Fingleton</ref><ref>p129 & pp135-136, Kay</ref><ref>pp35-41, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Australia \u2013 Second Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''...the ball hit first a thigh, then a chest. Sometimes it would go over the batsman\u2019s head, and whenever it came through at a playable height one of the many pairs of snatching hands in the leg trap took a catch that spelled doom first to [[Arthur Morris|Morris]], then [[Sam Loxton|Loxton]] and finally [[Neil Harvey|Harvey]]. [[Keith Miller|Miller]], [[Jack Moroney|Moroney]], [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] and [[Lindsay Hassett|Hassett]] preferred to thrust their legs in the way and found the umpire in league with the opposition on this afternoon of \"crazy\" cricket.'\u2019\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref name=\"Kay 136\">p136, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIf the English batsmen had struggled the Australians completely floundered. [[Jack Moroney]], [[Arthur Morris]] and [[Sam Loxton]] were out for ducks and [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] were 0/3 in a matter of minutes as [[Trevor Bailey]] took his new best Test figures of 4/22 and [[Alec Bedser]] 3/9. This was the worst start to a Test innings until [[Alec Bedser]] and [[Fred Trueman]] reduced India to 0/4 at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] in [[Indian cricket team in England in 1952|1952]]. [[Neil Harvey]] top-scored with 12, but the only runs came from the edge of the bat and after an hour Hassett gave up and declared on 32/7, leaving [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] 193 to win. This was a gamble as although there was still time to take quick wickets the pitch might recover the next day.<ref name=\"Kay 136\" /><ref>pp83-84, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp41-43, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===England \u2013 Second Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''At [[The Gabba|Brisbane]], on a wicket that was the worst that I have ever seen, the [[Yorkshireman]] was superb. The head-high bouncer was safely ignored. The chest-high deliveries of both the pace men and the spinners were played safely to the ground, out of the way of the many grasping hands in the leg-trap, and [[Len Hutton|Hutton's]] display was a perfect lesson in the art of batsmanship...that will long remain in my memory, being by far the best innings I have ever seen played.''\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref>p14 & p130, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe batting captain is allowed seven minutes of rolling before his innings and [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] asked for the heavy roller to press down the wicket and take some of the demons out of it. In those days the [[The Gabba|Woolloongabba]] still used an old heavy roller drawn by a horse called Dobbin. As it had to be unhitched and led round after each pull of the roller over the pitch, most of the seven minutes was wasted and Brown did not get much of the rolling he asked for. This was of great importance as if he had insisted on seven minutes actual ''rolling'' instead of messing about at either end the wicket would have been much less dangerous and England would have had less time to bat out before stumps.<ref>pp84-85, Fingleton</ref> Though as [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] pointed out the time limits were devised when horse-drawn rollers were the norm and mechanical rollers were unheard of.<ref>pp37-38, O'Reilly</ref> Initially it made no difference as [[Reg Simpson]] was bowled first ball by a [[full toss]] from [[Ray Lindwall]] (2/21). The veteran England [[scorer]] [[Bill Ferguson (cricket scorer)|Bill Ferguson]] was using his famous Ferguson Charts to record the details of each innings; how many runs a batsman had scored, how many balls, how many minutes, how many boundaries, etc; When Simpson was out one wag called out \"How long Bill, and how many fours?\" which produced a roar of laughter from the [[press box]] that astonished the crowd.<ref>p79, Kay</ref>\n\n[[Cyril Washbrook]] (6) and [[John Dewes]] (9) were determined to see out the day with dead bats and the wicket showed no signs of danger, but [[Sam Loxton]] took a superb catch to get rid of the Lancastrian (Washbrook) off Lindwall. [[Jack Iverson]] was called up to bowl his first Test over 27 minutes before stumps and had [[Trevor Bailey]] in all kinds of trouble as his poked and prodded and could have been out five or six times in the mystery spinner's maiden over. Dewes was bowled by [[Keith Miller]] and with one over from Iverson remaining, [[Alec Bedser]] came out and immediately appealed against the bad light, but was turned down as he had yet to face a ball.\n\nBedser holed out to [[Neil Harvey]] off Iverson, Bailey gave a simple catch to [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] and [[Godfrey Evans]] ran out his fellow wicket-keeper [[Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)|Arthur McIntyre]] when he called for an unnecessary third run.\n\nBrown had fed in [[Nightwatchman (cricket)|nightwatchman]] after nightwatchman in order to save Hutton, Compton and himself for the next day, but the [[Pudsey|Man from Pudsey]] still had to come out at 30/6 to survive the last two balls of an extraordinary day. When asked for his opinion that night Hutton said they might win \"if the others will stay till lunch and it doesn't rain again\".<ref>p137, Kay</ref> It did not rain again, but needing 163 to win with only four wickets in hand there was no room for mistakes.\n\nIn the morning Brown, the umpires and a stopwatch ensured that England got their full 10 minutes rolling at the start of the day, which took nearly half an hour to complete. Evans (5) helped Hutton add 16 runs before he was caught by Loxton off Bill Johnston (2/30). [[Denis Compton]] came to the crease, but lasted one ball as he departed like Evans \"c Loxton, b Johnston\".\n\nBrown came in at number 10 and held on grimly as Hutton peeled off 3 boundaries, though in the end the captain made 17 of their 29 runs together before he became Loxton's fourth victim when he was caught off Iverson (4/43).\n\n[[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] was the last man in at 77/9 and his batting tended to be a hit-and-miss affair which rarely reached double figures. Hutton (62 not out) farmed the bowling ruthlessly, making 43 of the 45 runs added for the last wicket. Wright managed to hold a straight bat up to the few balls he was left to face until the last four balls from Iverson before lunch. He kept out the first three, but spooned the last to [[Ray Lindwall]] at square leg and the match was over. The 12,000 strong crowd gave Hutton an heroic ovation and after lunch he replied to the congratulations showered on him with by admitting that \"with a bit of luck I'd have won the game\".<ref>pp84-93, Fingleton</ref><ref>p130, pp136-139, Kay</ref><ref>pp43-45, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Result===\n[[File:Operation Crossroads Baker Edit.jpg|thumb|left|Some blamed the rainstorm that wrecked the First Test on the American [[atomic bomb]] experiments at [[Bikini Atoll]].]]\n<blockquote>\n''Australia's cricket ego was in no way deflated by what happened at [[Brisbane]].

There was too many clouds about in Brisbane for the city to miss rain for a whole week. Old women of both sexes ''[sic]'' were blaming our weather upsets on the [[atomic bomb]] experiment carried out by the Americans on [[Bikini Atoll]], to our north... and so there was no national caterwauling over Australia's loss of face at [[Brisbane]].

Few Australians fail to credit a gutsy performance and the stock of the tourists rocketed. It was also apparent that [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950\u201351|Australia]] had a chink in their armour as their batting collapsed on a perfectly good wicket on the first day and had been badly shown up on the rain-affected wicket on the third, but their bowling remained strong and [[Jack Iverson]] (4/43) had justified the selector's confidence in him.<ref>pp94-96, Fingleton</ref><ref>p130 & pp138-139, Kay</ref><ref>p46, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n==Second Test \u2013 Melbourne==\n{{Test match |\ndate = 22\u201327 December 1950|\nteam1 = {{cr|Australia}}|\nteam2 = {{cr|England}}|\n\nscore-team1-inns1 = 194|\nruns-team1-inns1 = [[Lindsay Hassett|A.L.

His famously damaged knee had swollen up after making another century \u2013 115 vs an [[MCC tour of Australia in 1950-51#Australian XI vs MCC|Australian XI]] \u2013 and hourly bulletins were posted by the MCC manager [[Michael Green (cricketer, born 1891)|Brigadier Michael Green]] expressing optimistically that he would play in order to help draw a large crowd for the Test, though doubts where express by those who had seen him. In the end he was unfit to play and was replaced by the [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Welsh]] amateur batsmen [[Gilbert Parkhouse]] who had made 58 in the [[MCC tour of Australia in 1950-51#Australian XI vs MCC|Australian XI]] game, adding 130 with the luckless Compton. The reserve wicket-keeper [[Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)|Arthur McIntyre]] was also dropped from his batting role and the teenaged [[Brian Close]] was brought in as the best of a bad bunch, having hit 105 not out against [[long hop]]s and [[full toss]]es served up in a minor game. Brown thought that if nothing else as an [[all-rounder]] he could help take some of the strain off the other bowlers and so Close became the youngest Englishman to play Australia in a Test. [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] made only one change, dropping [[Jack Moroney]] for having made a pair in the First Test. His successor was chosen in the [[MCC tour of Australia in 1950-51#Australian XI vs MCC|Australian XI]] game and opener [[Ken Archer]] (12th man at Brisbane) was given his [[Baggy green|Baggy Green]] ahead of the middle order batsman [[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]] (who was made 12th man), although he had only made 81 to Burke's 128.

[[Neil Harvey]] (42) came in at 6/1 and [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] were 67/1 at lunch despite the bowling of Bedser (who bowled unchanged throughout the morning) and [[Trevor Bailey|Bailey]] and surprisingly good English fielding. Hassett even apologised to Brown as the ball was constantly fell just short of the slips, or flew over their heads as Harvey rode his luck. After lunch Bedser tickled Harvey's edge with a ball that [[Godfrey Evans]] snapped up instinctively, but had he missed few would have realised was a chance. The big bowler then held onto [[Ken Archer]] (26) in the slips by throwing himself to the ground and taking the ball in his outstretched right hand and [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] were 89/3. [[Keith Miller]], whose [[Matinee idol|matin\u00e9e idol]] looks greatly affected his teenager fans, made 18, but his potential boundaries were stymied by [[Cyril Washbrook]] in the covers and [[Reg Simpson]] on the boundary-fence and he was trapped [[leg before wicket|lbw]] by [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] (1/28) to bring [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] down to 93/4 on a good pitch on a perfect sunny day.

[[Cyril Washbrook]] was joined by [[Len Hutton]] \u2013 still batting in the middle order \u2013 to re-establish their old partnership and set about restoring the innings. Washbrook (21) made some charming cover-drives before he was given out [[leg before wicket|lbw]] to [[Ray Lindwall]] (2/46), although only he and [[Don Tallon]] appealed and the other nine fielders remained silent. [[Jack Iverson]] was brought on and saw a ball flick off Hutton's pads as he checked a sweep (it was the over before lunch).

Captain [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] and [[Gilbert Parkhouse]] returned to the crease after lunch and made the best of things, but the Welshman's stilt-like footwork was his undoing and he was caught by Hassett off Miller. He was replaced by [[Trevor Bailey]] who steadfastly defended at one end while his captain brought the crowd to its feet hitting Johnson straight down the ground for six and through the covers for four. He hit three more boundaries in his 62 and they added 65 for the seventh wicket. Bailey was out first, bowled by Lindwall and Brown was caught by Johnson off Iverson. [[Godfrey Evans]] hit Lindwall straight to the boundary and took 8 runs off Miller, which resulted in a bouncer, which the keeper dodged like a [[Boxing|boxer]], and the bowler being booed. Evans cracked another four past point off Miller, who was removed from the attack, and passed 1,000 runs in Tests, but was \"c Johnson, b Iverson\" for 49 and was cheered by the crowd when he left. [[Alec Bedser]] (5 not out) had batted for nearly an hour helping Evans, but [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] (2) only lasted five minutes and [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] were out for 197, exceeding [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia's]] First Innings by only 3 runs.

To be fair they had made 212 for the first wicket against the [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/19/19416.html West Indies at Trent Bridge] earlier in the year. On this occasion they added 21 against Lindwall and Miller when the spinners were brought on.

[[John Dewes]], coming in to bat from his sick bed like [[Eddie Paynter]] in the Fourth Test of 1932\u201333, stayed in for 46&nbsp;minutes making a gutsy 5 before falling to Iverson (2/36) at 82/4. In the lunch break [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] needed less than a hundred runs to win and there was an earnest discussion as to whether Hutton should bat in his usual careful way or should try to make the runs before he ran out of partners, as had happened at [[The Gabba|Brisbane]]. He decided on the latter and by forcing the pace struck out at Bill Johnston (4/26) and was caught at square leg for 40, which caused a deathly silence across the 50,000 strong crowd. As in the first innings [[Brian Close]] was soon out ([[leg before wicket|lbw]] to Johnston for 1), Brown was bowled by Lindwall, who then removed Evans \"with a ball which pitched outside the off stump, came in at a crazy angle and knocked back the off stump without leaving the turf by a centimetre\".<ref>p107, [[Keith Miller]], ''Cricket Crossfire'', Oldbourne Press, 1956</ref> [[Gilbert Parkhouse]], who batted manfully for 102 minutes and when he was out for 28 [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] were 134/9 and still needed 45 to win.

[[Sydney Cricket Ground|Sydney]] is a famous spinning wicket, though the three tour matches the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] had seen lots of runs for few wickets. In the [[MCC tour of Australia in 1950-51|New South Wales]] game immediately before the Third Test they had made 553/8 with [[Len Hutton]] making 150 and [[Reg Simpson]] 259 and the fast-medium bowler [[John Warr]] took 4/67. As a result the unhappy [[Brian Close]] was dropped in favour of Warr, making his debut, and [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] went into the Test with [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] as the only specialist spinner, supported by the part-time spin of [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] and [[Denis Compton]]. The leg-spinner [[Eric Hollies]] had taken 5 wickets (78.60) in his three games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and off-spinner [[Bob Berry (cricketer)|Bob Berry]] was going for 4 runs an over in his containment role and were not chosen.

Hutton was full of confidence, 19 runs came off the first three overs and [[Keith Miller]] asked for a new ball in the fourth. [[Herbert Elphinstone|Umpire Elphinstone]] examined the ball and changed it for a new one, which he ground into the dust to take the shine off. Hutton insisted on a look and bounced on the grass a few times so that it would lose its shape. It made no difference as another 8 runs came of the next two overs and Miller was taken off, only to take a diving catch off [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] (3/94) to dismiss Washbrook. Miller said this was the finest catch of his career; \"He played the perfect cut, but, fielding in the gully, I had anticipated the shot. I ran across before he played it, flung out my hand and held the ball. I was just as astonished as Cyril\".<ref>p161, [[Keith Miller]], ''Cricket Crossfire'', Oldbourne Press, 1956</ref> Hutton (62) and Simpson (49) took the score to 128/1 when Miller was brought back on to bowl one of his most famous overs. He bowled a \"super ball\" to dismiss Hutton [[leg before wicket|lbw]] and bowled [[Denis Compton]] for a duck when the ball clipped the edge of the bat and ricocheted into the stumps. [[Gilbert Parkhouse]] survived until tea, but [[Reg Simpson]] guided another ball from Miller to [[Sam Loxton]] at short-fine-leg and [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] were 137/4. The popular [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] strode out to the applause of the crowd hoping for some more Melbourne-style big-hitting and they were not disappointed. Hassett took the new ball, but Brown hit [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] to the fence, lofted [[Ray Lindwall|Lindwall]] into the deep and cracked a straight-drive onto [[Andrew Barlow|Umpire Barlow's]] foot. He added 50 with Parkhouse (25) before the [[Welshman]] pulled [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] to [[Arthur Morris]] at mid-on at 187/5. He was replaced by [[Trevor Bailey]] who held up one end while Brown scattered the in-field and clouted the [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] bowling round the ground. When he was finally out the next day, playing over a [[yorker]] from [[Ray Lindwall]] for 79, he had made his highest Test score, the highest for [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] so far in the series, and received a royal reception from the crowd. [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] was now 258/6, their highest innings of a low scoring series, but without their fiery captain they collapsed to 290 all out. Bailey had his thumb broken by a Lindwall [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] at 263/6 and was taken to [[St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne|St Vincent's Hospital]]. [[Godfrey Evans]] struck 3 fours in his 23 not out, but [[Alec Bedser]] was bowled by Lindwall (2/60) and [[John Warr]] by Miller (4/37).

The bowling thus fell heavily on the shoulders of [[Alec Bedser]], the 40-year-old captain [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] and debutant [[John Warr]]. They had no regular spinner and would have to rely on Brown's part-time leg-spin, the [[left-arm unorthodox spin]] of the injured [[Denis Compton]] and the comedy leg-breaks of [[Len Hutton]]. In the end Compton only bowled 6 overs and Hutton none; the bowling was completed by Bedser (43\u20134\u2013107\u20134), Warr (36\u20134\u2013142\u20130) and Brown (44\u20134\u2013153\u20134), bowling [[Over (cricket)|eight-ball overs]]. The innings began with [[John Warr]] bowling to [[Ken Archer]] as [[Arthur Morris]] always batted second and his [[archenemy|nemesis]] [[Alec Bedser]] bowled him with the first ball of the second over. Although [[Neil Harvey]] had made 74, 12, 42 and 31 batting at number 3 [[Lindsay Hassett]] finally saw that the left-handed strokemaker would fare better further down the order and came in himself. With rain expected over the weekend Brown set defensive fields and with the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] fielding on top form Archer (44 not out) and Hassett (62 not out) slowly batted out the day for 110/1 despite the constant barracking of the crowd, who shouted \"Get on with it!\". There was rain on the rest day, but most of it avoided the ground and it rolled out well. When play resumed the wicket took a lot of pace and bounce from the ball and [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] were doomed to a long day in the field. Even so [[Godfrey Evans]] took a brilliant catch off a leg-glance by Archer (48) off Bedser, who was involved in the first 6 wickets to fall. Brown bowled a leg-spinner that fizzed off the pitch and beat Hassett (70) and missed the stumps, but his next ball the Australian captain hit a catch to Bedser at mid-on and his team was 122/3. The presence of [[Neil Harvey]] and [[Keith Miller]] at the crease against a depleted bowling attack would usually ensure a flow of runs, but while Harvey hit 39 in 79&nbsp;minutes before being bowled by Bedser, Miller nudged his way at the funeral rate of 24 runs an hour. [[Sam Loxton]] survived a close [[run out]] when [[Cyril Washbrook]] brilliantly threw down his stumps, but was out for 17 when he hoisted a [[long hop]] from Brown into the hands of Bedser, who then caught [[Don Tallon]] [[leg before wicket|lbw]] for 18. At 252/6 [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] were still 38 runs behind when [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] came to the crease and started to hit the ball around in his top Test score of 77, he added 150 with Miller in the highest seventh wicket stand for Australia since [[Clem Hill]] and [[Hugh Trumble]] made 165 at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]] in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1897\u201398|1897\u201398]]. They took [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] past 300 and 400 for the first time in the series and Miller reached his century after 274&nbsp;minutes. Brown bowled Johnson, had Lindwall [[leg before wicket|lbw]] and had Australia 406/8. With the tail now in Miller lifted Warr for six, but ran out [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] and [[Jack Iverson]] to end the innings with his then highest Test score of 145 not out.

He had Hutton out for 9, the ball was snicked behind, where the wicket-keeper [[Don Tallon]] knocked it to [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] in the slips who [[juggle]]d the ball and dropped it, upon which Tallon dived across and took the catch. [[Reg Simpson]] showed his usual bad form against spinners and was caught behind for a duck (even though Tallon did not appeal) and Washbrook was bowled for 34 after hitting two boundaries off Johnson. [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] were now 45/3 and Iverson had taken 3/2.

It lacked virility from birth. The Australians came to it with no great spirit of adventure or relish after [[the Ashes]] had been won. The policy was, after winning the toss, to hold tight and let the pitch and the Englishmen go to pieces. What went to pieces, of course, was the game itself.''\n:[[Jack Fingleton]]<ref name=\"p188, Fingleton\">p188, Fingleton</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAlthough [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] had wrapped up [[the Ashes]] there was still considerable interest in the series as many felt that [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown's]] team deserved a win for all their efforts. Since the Third Test they had won four games on the trot by 9 wickets, 10 wickets, an innings and 25 runs and 152 runs and morale was as high as it had ever been. After his dismal showing at [[Sydney Cricket Ground|Sydney]] the Australian vice-captain [[Arthur Morris]] asked to be dropped, he had been dismissed four times out of five by [[Alec Bedser]] (for 25, 0, 2 and 0) and was nicknamed \"Bedser's Bunny\". The selectors declined and instead dropped [[Sam Loxton]] after 11 consecutive Tests and brought in [[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]] of [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] to strengthen the lower order batting. Loxton was an outstanding fielder and was still brought to [[Adelaide]] as 12th man. [[Roy Tattersall]] of [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] had been flown out as a replacement for the injured [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] and was picked for his debut. This young [[off-spinner]] had topped the tables in 1950 with 193 wickets (13.59), including twenty 5-wicket and six 10-wicket hauls. The [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] players had been singing his praises since they arrived in Australia, so there was much curiosity about him down under. [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]]'s pulled leg-muscle has recovered and he would also play and Tattersall replaced [[Trevor Bailey]], whose broken thumb had not yet mended. [[Gilbert Parkhouse]] was dropped and replaced by his fellow amateur [[David Sheppard]] and despite taking 0/142 at [[Sydney Cricket Ground|Sydney]] [[John Warr]] was kept in the team. The [[Adelaide Oval]] was notorious for being the flattest wicket in Australia, but had taken spin from the first morning in the tour match when the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] (211 & 220) beat [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] (126 & 153) by 152 runs. Even so when [[Lindsay Hassett]] won the toss he made the easy decision to bat first.<ref>pp172-174, Fingleton</ref><ref>p174 & pp198-200, Kay</ref><ref>pp100-103, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Australia \u2013 First Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''[[Arthur Morris|Morris]] had become very fed up of hearing [[Alec Bedser|Bedser's]] name. He sat that morning at No. 13 table in the hotel dining-room and gave a shudder when he saw it \u2013 but decided to sit tight. This, then, was a happy day for him. he had come back to the ranks of Test batsmen again.''\n:[[Jack Fingleton]]<ref>p176, Fingleton</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe first [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] wicket fell before a run was on the board for the third time in the series, but it was [[Ken Archer]] who succumbed to [[Alec Bedser]] when he glanced the third ball of the day to [[Denis Compton]] at short fine-leg, though he hung about the wicket even after he was given out by [[Andrew Barlow|Umpire Barlow]]. Having livened up the crowd the bowlers had a tough day as the [[Adelaide Oval]] was up to its usual standards. [[Arthur Morris]] batted a very careful and composed innings, the highest of his Test career as he laid his reputation as \"Bedser's Bunny\" to rest. He made 206 out of [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia's]] 371 before he was the last man out, spending 7 hours and 42&nbsp;minutes at the crease and striking 23 boundaries in the process. He passed 2,000 runs in Tests and made his seventh [[the Ashes|Ashes]] century in four years, overtaking [[Victor Trumper]] and [[Bill Woodfull]] placing him behind only [[Sir Donald Bradman]] on the list of Australian century-makers against [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]]. No other [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] batsman made 50, but he added 95 runs for the second wicket with [[Lindsay Hassett]] (43), 110 for the third wicket with [[Neil Harvey]] (44) and 76 for the fourth wicket with [[Keith Miller]] (44). Thereafter wickets fell sharply, the last five falling for 14 runs, and the innings ended when he was bowled by [[Roy Tattersall]] (3/95). The young [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] off-spinner had an impressive debut which justified his selection even though he had to borrow [[E.W. Swanton]]'s boots because his feet had swollen on the flight. He began by conceding only 5 runs from his first 6 overs and spun the ball so much that it floated across the wicket before turning on the unhelpful wicket. He dismissed fellow debutant [[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]] with a ball that he bowled at the leg stump so that Burke went down on one knee to sweep it, but it floated over the wicket and knocked over the off-stump. He also bowled [[Don Tallon]], getting his three wickets without any help from the fielders. [[Alec Bedser]] returned figures of 3/74, but Hassett protected Morris early in his innings and Miller hit his first over of the second day for 15. [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] took 4/99 and only Morris, a noted player of spinners, was able to master him, but [[John Warr]] (0/63) could still not take a wicket.<ref>pp174-178, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp200-205, Kay</ref><ref>pp103-107, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===England \u2013 First Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''The [[Yorkshireman]] was magnificent.

Hutton made 156 not out in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England's]] 272, hit 11 fours and nobody else made 30. [[Ray Lindwall]] (3/51) dismissed [[Cyril Washbrook]] for 2 when the pedestrian [[Jack Iverson]] took a high, leaping catch when the batsmen heaved the ball to the leg-side. The spinners were soon on and Hutton hit [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] for two boundaries. He went two yards down the wicket and was almost stumped by [[Don Tallon]] for 34, but he nicked the ball and the deflection made Tallon miss both the catch and the stumping. [[Reg Simpson]] was the second highest scorer with 29 and together they added 83 for the second wicket before Simpson was bowled by the left-arm bowler [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] and [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] finished the day 96/2. The following morning Lindwall and Miller argued with Tallon that he ought to stand three yards closer to the stumps as the pitch was so slow. He refused and Lindwall bowled at a reduced pace, so nudged by Miller Tallon moved up for the third ball, which nicked [[Denis Compton]]'s bat and the keeper took the catch low off the ground. Had he remained back Tallon could not have made the catch. The other [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] batsmen made a steady procession to and from the wicket as Bill Johnston (3/68) and Iverson (3/58) worked their way through the order as Hutton batted serenely on, now untouchable by any of the bowlers. [[David Sheppard]] almost ran Hutton out when he rushed down the wicket to get off the mark, [[Godfrey Evans]] tried to do the same, but Hutton wisely ignored him and the keeper scrambled back before his wicket was wrecked by Lindwall. [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] was caught [[Leg before wicket|leg before]] by Miller (1/30), who immediately appealed and [[Arthur Cocks (umpire)|Umpire Cocks]] gave him out, then the ball rolled back onto his stumps and knocked off a bail, so he ended up being bowled. Debutant [[Roy Tattersall]] was crowded by the [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] fielders and was caught by [[Neil Harvey]] off Iverson for a duck. [[John Warr]] was bowled for another duck by Bill Johnston. [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] came in at 219/9 and held off the Australian attack for over an hour as he and Hutton added 53 for the last wicket, resembling their last stand at [[The Gabba|Brisbane]]. Lindwall wasn't recalled to the attack until after 5 o'clock and promptly caught the [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] spinner [[leg before wicket]] for 14. [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] were out for 272, 99 runs behind [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] and Hutton was applauded off the field by the [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] team.<ref>pp174-183, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp205-207, Kay</ref><ref>pp107-114, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Australia \u2013 Second Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''[[Marylebone Cricket Club|M.C.C.]] captain [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]], and a joint manager of the team, [[Michael Green (cricketer, born 1891)|Brigadier M.

Brigadier Green was admitted to the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] in a semi-conscious condition, suffering from a probable fractured nose, and Brown was treated for cuts to the head and left knee. Brown, who had four stitches inserted in his left knee and two in his head, is reported to have said soon after the accident that he would play today.

Archer called Morris for a run off Bedser, but they both hesitated in the middle and Morris was run out for 16 by a left-handed throw from [[David Sheppard]]. [[Lindsay Hassett]] was almost bowled first ball, but survived and [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] were 34/1 at stumps.

Bedser (5/46) had Lindwall caught by Compton in second slip and Brown (5/49) had Iverson caught by Washbrook in the covers and the [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] innings closed on 217. It was Brown's best bowling and his only five-wicket haul in Tests.<ref>pp190-196, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp221-225, Kay</ref><ref>pp130-134, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===England \u2013 First Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''It was interesting to see the crowd's reaction to the English last-wicket partnership. They cheered every scoring shot and went into ecstasy over [[Roy Tattersall|Tattersall's]] efforts. It was quite obvious that they had decided to fight the battle out for [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] and were plainly partisan...There are many Australians, and I am one of them, who believe that cricket will reach its highest level again when England and Australia are on level pegging. These were the people who cheered the tenth-wicket partnership to the echo.''\n:[[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]]<ref>p143, O'Reilly</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe old firm of [[Len Hutton|Hutton]] and [[Cyril Washbrook|Washbrook]] opened for [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] and added 40 runs in 32&nbsp;minutes for the first wicket before Washbrook tickled a ball from [[Keith Miller]] into the gloves of [[Don Tallon]]. Brown thought that if the [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] bowling was attacked they would buckle under and [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] would get more runs, in any case Hutton hit 8 boundaries in his 79 and added 131 runs with [[Reg Simpson]] in 142&nbsp;minutes, the only century stand of the series for [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] . With Hutton in fine form the [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Notts]] opener was able to play himself in and at 171/1 the English batsmen were in finally in control. In desperation Hassett brought on debutant [[Graeme Hole]] to try out his off-spinners and to everyone's surprise his fourth ball clean bowled the England opener and the [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] bowling attack took an interest in affairs again. Lindwall (3/77) and Miller (4/76) bowled with greater speed and hostility than at any time in the series and by stumps [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] were 218/6 with [[Denis Compton|Compton]], [[David Sheppard|Sheppard]], [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Brown]] and [[Godfrey Evans|Evans]] all gone and Simpson (80 not out) left with [[Alec Bedser]] (3 not out). Lindwall bowled Bedser for 11 and [[Jack Iverson]] (2/40) disposed of [[Trevor Bailey]] and [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] to bring last man [[Roy Tattersall]] in at 246/9 with [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] just 18 runs ahead. With Simpson on 92 the main concern was whether he would reach 100 on this his 31st birthday, but this was soon resolved when he hit 11 runs off his next over from Miller. Hassett spread out the field to allow Simpson to take singles so they could concentrate on Tattersall, who was surrounded with close fielders. The young Lancastrian kept a straight bat and Simpson cracked 6 fours as they hit 50 runs in the 34&nbsp;minutes before lunch. Miller bowled Tattersall for 10 after the break and Simpson was left on 156 not out, his highest score in Tests and his greatest Test innings. Their stand added 74 runs in 55&nbsp;minutes and took [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] to 320, their only score of the series over 300, and a lead of 103 runs.<ref>pp196-202, Fingleton</ref><ref>p225-230, Kay</ref><ref>pp134-143, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Australia \u2013 Second Innings===\n[[File:Graeme Hole 1949.jpg|thumb|[[Graeme Hole]] made 18 and 63 on his Test debut.]]\n<blockquote>\n''[[Alec Bedser|Bedser]] was given a wonderful ovation when he came off the field with five more wickets to his name, and a match record of 10 for 105 \u2013 just one more instance of proof furnished by the [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] man that on Australian wickets he is the world's outstanding pace bowler.''\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref>p231, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] hopes that they could set [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] a good target received an immediate double blow as [[Alec Bedser]] sent Morris and Burke straight back to the [[pavilion]]. [[Lindsay Hassett]] and [[Neil Harvey]] salvaged a stand of 81 from the wreckage of 6/2, with Harvey swashbuckling his way to 52 in what [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] thought was his best innings of the series. He was torpedoed by a shooter from [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] (3/56) and [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] (1/32) caught and bowled [[Keith Miller]] for a duck to leave them 89/4. Hassett found another partner in [[Graeme Hole]] and saw out the day at 129/4, but was skittled in the morning for 48 \u2013 [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]]'s 100th test wicket \u2013 when a leg-spinner zipped one past his bat and toppled his off-stump. Wright finally showed why he was so feared on the county circuit when [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] lofted a googly to Brown at mid-off. [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] were now 142/6, a mere 39 runs ahead, but Hole stood steady for three hours making 63 until he was bowled by [[Trevor Bailey]] (1/32). Brown figured that if anybody deserved some easy wickets it was Bedser and the big [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] bowler removed Lindwall, Johnston and Iverson for five runs and ending his superb tour with 5/59, 10/105 in the match. His 30 wickets (16.06) was the most by an English bowler in Australia since [[Harold Larwood]]'s 33 wickets (19.51) in 1932\u201333.<ref>pp202-208, Fingleton</ref><ref>p230-231, Kay</ref><ref>pp143-150, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===England \u2013 Second Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''Not once, but three times, the stumps were plucked by players eager to grab [[souvenir]]s of an historic occasion. First of all, the Australian captain bowled a [[full toss]] down the leg side and took it for granted that [[Denis Compton|Compton]] would hit the ball to the boundary rails. He forgot that Compton was out of form and out of luck. Instead of the ball going to the rails, it was missed completely and poor [[Don Tallon|Tallon]], with his arms full of stumps and bails, had to drop the lot and take the ball.''\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref>pp218-219, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] needed 95 runs to win and \"an [[earthquake]] would not have shaken [[Len Hutton|Hutton's]] determination not to be out when until victory was gained\".<ref>P219, Kay</ref> he made 60 not out, his fifth innings over 50 and fourth unbeaten innings of the series and hit the winning runs. Washbrook (7) and Simpson (15) did not last the pace, but [[Denis Compton]] finally had some luck as he made 11 not out. [[Lindsay Hassett]] bowled the last over with the fielders crowded round the batsman, not in the hope of a catch, but so they could fight [[Don Tallon]] and the umpire for [[souvenir]] stumps and bails. They jumped the gun twice, once when Hassett bowled a rank [[full toss]] down the leg side, expecting [[Denis Compton]] to sweep it to the boundary, so did the umpire who called no ball and grabbed two stumps, Hassett the other and Tallon three, but the Compton missed, Tallon dropped his stumps as he jumped on the ball and they had to start again. The next ball was a single, then with one run to win [[Len Hutton|Hutton]] amused himself by smothering a full toss amidst the chaos. Play was held up until [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] returned a bail he had hidden in his pocket. Finally, Compton pulled a stump out the ground and ran down the wicket as Hutton pushed the ball wide of square-leg and trotted over the crease to be congratulated by Hassett while Tallon fought off the close fielders for the stumps. The English batsmen were cheered off the pitch and they shouted for Brown to give them a speech, which he did, giving particular thanks to [[Len Hutton]] and [[Alec Bedser]]. The team repaired to their hotel for toasts of [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] \"To [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] \u2013 and to Freddie Brown\" and to read the congratulatory telegrams that poured in from all over the world.<ref>pp208-211, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp218-222 & pp231-232, Kay</ref><ref>pp150-151, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Result===\n[[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] beat [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] by 8 wickets, but still lost the series 4\u20131. It was the first Test [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] had won since the First Test vs the West Indies at [[Old Trafford cricket ground|Old Trafford]] in [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1950|1950]], having lost the 7 intervening Tests. It was their first victory over Australia since the Fifth Test at [[the Oval]] in 1938, 15 Tests previously. The only survivors were [[Len Hutton]] and [[Denis Compton]], the batsmen at the wicket when the winning runs were scored, and [[Lindsay Hassett]], who bowled the final over. It was the first Test Australia had lost since [[the Oval]] in [[Australian cricket team in England in 1938|1938]] and ended their run of 26 Tests and 96 games in all cricket without defeat.<ref>pp211-213, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp218, pp220-221 & pp231-232, Kay</ref>\n\n==1950\u201351 Test Series Averages==\n[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Marylebone_Cricket_Club_in_Australia_and_New_Zealand_1950-51/Team_Averages.html Source] As was the convention of the time gentleman amateurs have their initials in front of their surname and professional players have their initials after their name, if used at all.<ref>p42, p56, p68, Brown.</ref><ref>p14 and p97, [[Fred Titmus]], ''My Life in Cricket'', John Blake Publishing Ltd, 2005</ref> The Australians were all amateurs until the [[Kerry Packer|Packer Revolution]], even though they played like professionals.

[[Len Hutton]]'s batting average (88.83) was double that of every other batsmen in the series. [[Keith Miller]] (43.75) topped the Australian batting averages, the lowest average to do so by an Australian since the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1911\u201312|1911\u201312 Ashes series]] when [[Sidney Barnes]] and [[Frank Foster (cricketer)|Frank Foster]] ran riot.

It formed part of the '''[[MCC tour of Australia in 1950\u201351]]''' and the matches outside the Tests were played in the name of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]]. The '''[[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England team]]''' under the captaincy of the big-hearted [[all-rounder]] [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] was regarded as the weakest sent to Australia and \"without [[Alec Bedser|Bedser]] and [[Len Hutton|Hutton]], [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] would have been little better than a [[Club cricket|club side]]\".<ref>p220, Kay</ref> Few gave them a chance of regaining [[the Ashes]] and they lost the series 4\u20131 to [[Lindsay Hassett]]'s '''[[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian team]]''', which had far greater reserves of talent. In the Fifth and final Test England beat Australia for the first time since 1938 and ended their unbeaten run of 14 Tests against England, 26 Tests against all teams and 96 games in all cricket since the [[Second World War]]. After this victory England would defeat Australia in [[Australian cricket team in England in 1953|1953]], [[1954\u201355 Ashes series|1954\u201355]] and [[Australian cricket team in England in 1956|1956]].\n\nIt was a great all round team effort from the Australians; the captain [[Lindsay Hassett]] made 366 runs (40.66), [[Neil Harvey]] 362 runs (40.22), [[Keith Miller]] 350 runs (43.75) and [[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]] 125 runs (41.66). The [[fast bowler]] [[Ray Lindwall]] took 15 wickets (22.93), his new-ball partner [[Keith Miller]] 17 wickets (17.70), [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] 22 wickets (19.18) and the mystery spin of [[Jack Iverson]] 21 wickets (15.23) in his only Test series. This was the first Ashes series to be played since the retirement of [[Don Bradman]] and it saw the debut of [[Ken Archer]], [[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]], [[Graeme Hole]] and [[Jack Iverson]] for [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] and [[John Warr]] and [[Roy Tattersall]] for England.\n\nDespite their defeat it was two English players who dominated the series; [[Len Hutton]] \"a [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] among the [[minnows]]\" made 533 runs (88.83) with an average double that of any other batsman, English or Australian.<ref>p 79, Swanton</ref> [[Alec Bedser]] took 30 wickets (16.06) and began his dominance of Australian batsmen that would continue into 1953, when he and Hutton would be instrumental in regaining the Ashes for England. The forty-year-old [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] had a successful series and won considerable popularity with his jovial determination to fight on regardless of the odds. Given the close results in the First and Second Tests it is possible that [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] could have won had [[Bill Edrich]] or [[Jim Laker]] been brought over, or [[Denis Compton]] had been fully fit. The [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] strokemaker had a chequered tour, averaging 7.57 in the Tests and 92.11 in his other First Class matches.\n\n==First Test \u2013 Brisbane==\n{{Test match |\ndate = 1\u20134 December 1950|\nteam1 = {{cr|Australia}}|\nteam2 = {{cr|England}}|\n\nscore-team1-inns1 = 228|\nruns-team1-inns1 = [[Neil Harvey|R.N.

Nobody seems to know why, and all sorts of arguments are ventilated for and against more cricket Tests on the [[The Gabba|Woolloongabba]] ground. I am all in favour of robbing Queensland of its greatest cricketing occasion, for the ground depresses. It is not a cricket ground at all. It is a [[concentration camp]]! Wire fences abound. Spectators are herded and sorted out into lots as though for all the world this was a slave market and not a game of cricket. The stands are of wood and filthy to sit on. The dining rooms are barns, without a touch of colour or a picture on the wall. Everywhere there is dust and dirt...The field is rough, although the wicket is usually a good one until it rains. Then it is a strip of turf with thousands of demons prancing up and down...at [[Brisbane]] only a [[Len Hutton|Hutton]] could stay, let alone score runs.''\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref>pp59-60, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSelection of the [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian team]] would seem to be a simple process as eight of its members were highly talented cricketers who almost picked themselves; [[Lindsay Hassett]], [[Arthur Morris]], [[Neil Harvey]], [[Don Tallon]], [[Keith Miller]], [[Ray Lindwall]], [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]], and [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]]. [[Don Tallon]] replaced [[Ron Saggers]] who had kept wicket on the tour of [[History of cricket in South Africa from 1945\u201346 to 1970|South Africa in 1949\u201350]], which Tallon had missed. [[Ray Lindwall]] had been dropped for the last Test in South Africa, his form suffering from a series of ailments, but was recalled to the team to replace [[Geff Noblet]]. Batsmen [[Jack Moroney]] and [[Sam Loxton]] kept their places, but leg-spinner [[Colin McCool]] was replaced by the 35-year-old debutant mystery spinner [[Jack Iverson]]. The task for the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] tour selectors was not quite so easy. The managers [[Michael Green (cricketer, born 1891)|Brigadier Michael Green]] and [[John Nash (cricket administrator)|John Nash]], captain [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]], vice-captain [[Denis Compton]] and [[History of English amateur cricket|senior professional]] [[Len Hutton]] kept most of the team from the Fourth and final Test against the [[West Indian national cricket team|West Indies]] in 1950. This was not the best recommendation as they had lost the series 3\u20131 and the last Test by an innings even though Hutton carried his bat for 202 out of 344. [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]], [[Denis Compton]], [[Len Hutton]], [[Reg Simpson]], [[John Dewes]], [[Trevor Bailey]], [[Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)|Arthur McIntyre]], [[Alec Bedser]], [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] all stayed, but the young opener [[David Sheppard]] was replaced by veteran [[Cyril Washbrook]] and [[Godfrey Evans]] returned as [[wicket-keeper]]. Apart from Hutton, Washbrook, Compton and Simpson the batsmen were not in fine form. Dewes was chosen after he had made a gritty 117 against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] in the last tour match before the Test. The reserve wicket-keeper [[Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)|Arthur McIntyre]] was in the team for his batting and as ''[[How Now Brown Cow|Brown's Cows]]'' were desperately short of good fielders and McIntyre had a good throwing arm.<ref>p19, O'Reilly</ref> While the crowd was waiting for the captains to come out and toss a dapper little man came out and inspected the pitch and he passed by the spectators completely unnoticed. It was the Test selector [[Sir Donald Bradman]], such is fame.<ref>p65, Fingleton</ref> [[Keith Miller]] had recently made a slow 201 not out against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] on the flat [[The Gabba|Woolloongabba]] pitch and predicted that the Test would be \"the dullest in history\".<ref>p69, Fingleton</ref> [[Lindsay Hassett]] won the toss (as he would 9 times out of 10 in Ashes Tests) and although the [[The Gabba|Woolloongabba Ground]] had a reputation as \"result\" wicket it looked plumb and he batted without hesitation.<ref>pp61-66, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp128-130, Kay</ref><ref>p18, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Australia \u2013 First Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''Seldom has an [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England cricket team]] gone into the field with the odds greater against them than did the side under Freddie Brown's command at Brisbane on the first day of December 1950. The tour had up to that date been one long succession of inglorious displays that had riled the critics without exception...it was no exaggeration to state that before the game began not one man in the crowd of 13,000 was prepared for the shocks that followed.''\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref>p128, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n''[[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Brown]] called his team together the night before the Test began. His first words were \"Chaps, you have got to get stuck into this with me. I have not lost faith. We can win if we go out there to-morrow and get stuck right into it.\" He told them that he knew they had not produced their English form. He told them that their batting, bowling, fielding and catching were too often just too bad to be true. Chosen, as they were, to represent their country, they obviously could do better. Brown's told them just what he thought of everything. He finished by saying that if they went on to the field on the morrow with confidence in themselves, they could do the job.''\n:[[Jack Fingleton]]<ref>p64, Fingleton</ref>\n</blockquote>\nOne of the good points about the tour so far had been the rise of [[Trevor Bailey]] as new ball partner for [[Alec Bedser]]. He bowled the first over, but mistimed his run up for the first ball and had to walk back and start again, swinging his fourth ball to tickle the edge of [[Jack Moroney]]'s bat and send it to [[Len Hutton]] at [[Fielding (cricket)|fine leg]] for a duck.\n\n[[Neil Harvey]] joined [[Arthur Morris]] and they took the score to 66/1 by lunch, though Morris constantly played and missed at Bedser's in-swingers and made only 24 runs to 38 by the more fluent Harvey. [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] (1/81) came on to bowl a typical over with two [[long hop]]s, which Harvey cracked into the square-leg fence, but the first ball of the next had him groping at a [[googly]] that turned so fiercely that it missed both bat and stumps, \"a real pearl that morally bowled Harvey all the way\".<ref>p26, O'Reilly</ref> The following ball had Wright appealing for [[leg before wicket|lbw]], but it was turned down as it turned so much that it would have missed the stumps.\n\nReturning after the break Bedser dismissed the labouring Morris [[leg before wicket|lbw]] to bring [[Keith Miller]] on at 69/2. [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England's]] fielding had dramatically improved over its reputation on tour \u2013 Bedser had bowled seven eight ball overs for 6 runs \u2013 but these two strokemakers increased the run rate much to the joy of the crowd. Miller hit a typical [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] over for 12 as he served up a mixture of [[full toss]]es, [[long hop]]s, googlies, fierce leg-breaks and cunningly flighted balls. Harvey's 50 with 6 boundaries brought a cheer from the crowd, and he hit 3 more, a cover-drive and a pull off Bedser and dancing three steps down the wicket to hit Wright to the sightscreen. The [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] spinner returned to the wicket with his [[Triple jump|hop, skip and a jump]] and bowled a [[googly]] that Miller mishit it to a surprised [[Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)|Arthur McIntyre]] at short mid-on to have him out for 15.\n\n[[Lindsay Hassett]] was almost out first ball to Bedser, but a difficult chance was missed by [[Denis Compton]] and the Australian captain took a single. Bedser then bowled one of his rare out-swingers to Neil Harvey, [[Godfrey Evans]] taking the catch and whipping off the bails to have the [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victorian]] left-hander [[caught]] and [[stumped]], but the bowler's umpire responded first and Harvey was \"c. Evans b. Bedser\" for 74.\n\nHassett did not survive long, his off-stump was knocked over by a Bedser \"special\" and from 116/2 [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] had collapsed to 129/5. [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] came on the relieve Bedser and Evans took another great catch to remove Loxton (24), though [[Ray Lindwall]] (41) saw Australia to tea for 166/6.\n\nBrown (2/63) continued after the break, mixing up his medium-paced seamers with leg-spin to have the out of form Australian wicket-keeper [[Don Tallon]] caught by [[Reg Simpson]] on the square leg boundary at 172/7.\n\nLindwall and [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] held things up for three-quarters of an hour while adding 47 before Bailey (3/28) took the new ball. Simpson caught Johnson off Bailey and Bedser took Lindwall to give Bailey his third wicket.\n\nBedser was brought back on and Bill Johnston flipped him over the slips to the boundary. As he came to a halt half way down the pitch he stopped to chat with [[Alec Bedser|Alec]] while Iverson completed two runs. Only now did Johnston realise that [[Reg Simpson]] had stopped the ball and was throwing it in to [[Godfrey Evans|Evans]]. He ran back towards his crease running like a duck trying to take off from water alongside Iverson making his third run. Johnston got home, Iverson stopped two yards short to turn back to the bowler's end, but Evans missed the bowler's stumps and he was safe.\n\nAfter this comedy routine Bedser (4/45) had [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] caught by Hutton in the slips to dismiss Australia for 228 ten minutes before stumps, the last 4 wickets falling for just 9 runs. This low score after Australia had chosen to bat on a good wicket was a coup for the touring team, whose performance surprised everyone, it now only remained to see how well their batsmen could perform.<ref>pp66-76, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp128-134, Kay</ref><ref>pp23-35, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===England \u2013 First Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''...the ball proceeded to perform capers all against the laws of [[gravitation]], and there came the craziest day's cricket imaginable, with twenty wickets falling for 130 runs and two [[Declaration and forfeiture|declarations]] that must surely be unique in the annuals of Test cricket.''\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref>p129, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOn the recommendation of an MCC committee member in Australia the tour selectors had decided to demote [[Len Hutton]] \u2013 the best opener in the world \u2013 to bat at number 5 so that he could stiffen the fragile lower order. This was possible as they had two other openers in [[Cyril Washbrook]] and [[Reg Simpson]] and Hutton declined to object as he was outvoted and did not want to appear obstinate. The two new openers went out to the middle on the first day, but Simpson successfully appealed for bad light and no ball was bowled. It rained on the Saturday morning and though it dried out on the rest day that followed more rain poured down overnight and play was suspended until the Monday afternoon. [[Keith Miller]] and [[Denis Compton]] took advantage of the situation by going to the local [[horse racing]] track, ringing the ground to check when play was to resume and dashing back just in time.<ref>p103, [[Keith Miller]], ''Cricket Crossfire'', Olbourne Press, 1956</ref>\n\nAlthough other First Class games had their pitches covered they were not for Test matches \u2013 a ruling that would change as a result of what was to follow. The pitch was reduced to a \"mudheap\", \"sticky dog\" or \"glue-pot\" so beloved by purists as only a batsman with classic technique could hope to play on it, in other words [[Len Hutton]]. The roller reduced the effects of the rain and Simpson (12) and Washbrook (19) added 28 for the first wicket while the going was good.\n\nThe wicket-keeper [[Godfrey Evans]] (16) was brought in as a [[nightwatchman (cricket)|\"daywatchman\"]] while the pitch dried out to normality. [[Ray Lindwall]] bowled only one over before being taken off and [[Keith Miller]] (2/29) and [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] (5/35) were brought on by Hassett to exploit the conditions with their part-time spin as England collapsed from 49/1 to 67/7 as good length balls leapt chest-high, shot along the ground, turned and straightened.\n\nBrown declared on 68/7, 160 runs behind, a move without precedent in Test cricket, but the England captain wanted to get the Australians onto the pitch before it dried out and became inhabitable. With hindsight he should have delayed as Hutton was still 8 not out and could have added some runs. As it was England was forced to bat again before stumps, but few captains anticipate getting Australia 32/7.<ref>pp75-83, Fingleton</ref><ref>p129 & pp135-136, Kay</ref><ref>pp35-41, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Australia \u2013 Second Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''...the ball hit first a thigh, then a chest. Sometimes it would go over the batsman\u2019s head, and whenever it came through at a playable height one of the many pairs of snatching hands in the leg trap took a catch that spelled doom first to [[Arthur Morris|Morris]], then [[Sam Loxton|Loxton]] and finally [[Neil Harvey|Harvey]]. [[Keith Miller|Miller]], [[Jack Moroney|Moroney]], [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] and [[Lindsay Hassett|Hassett]] preferred to thrust their legs in the way and found the umpire in league with the opposition on this afternoon of \"crazy\" cricket.'\u2019\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref name=\"Kay 136\">p136, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIf the English batsmen had struggled the Australians completely floundered. [[Jack Moroney]], [[Arthur Morris]] and [[Sam Loxton]] were out for ducks and [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] were 0/3 in a matter of minutes as [[Trevor Bailey]] took his new best Test figures of 4/22 and [[Alec Bedser]] 3/9. This was the worst start to a Test innings until [[Alec Bedser]] and [[Fred Trueman]] reduced India to 0/4 at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] in [[Indian cricket team in England in 1952|1952]]. [[Neil Harvey]] top-scored with 12, but the only runs came from the edge of the bat and after an hour Hassett gave up and declared on 32/7, leaving [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] 193 to win. This was a gamble as although there was still time to take quick wickets the pitch might recover the next day.<ref name=\"Kay 136\" /><ref>pp83-84, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp41-43, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===England \u2013 Second Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''At [[The Gabba|Brisbane]], on a wicket that was the worst that I have ever seen, the [[Yorkshireman]] was superb. The head-high bouncer was safely ignored. The chest-high deliveries of both the pace men and the spinners were played safely to the ground, out of the way of the many grasping hands in the leg-trap, and [[Len Hutton|Hutton's]] display was a perfect lesson in the art of batsmanship...that will long remain in my memory, being by far the best innings I have ever seen played.''\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref>p14 & p130, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe batting captain is allowed seven minutes of rolling before his innings and [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] asked for the heavy roller to press down the wicket and take some of the demons out of it. In those days the [[The Gabba|Woolloongabba]] still used an old heavy roller drawn by a horse called Dobbin. As it had to be unhitched and led round after each pull of the roller over the pitch, most of the seven minutes was wasted and Brown did not get much of the rolling he asked for. This was of great importance as if he had insisted on seven minutes actual ''rolling'' instead of messing about at either end the wicket would have been much less dangerous and England would have had less time to bat out before stumps.<ref>pp84-85, Fingleton</ref> Though as [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] pointed out the time limits were devised when horse-drawn rollers were the norm and mechanical rollers were unheard of.<ref>pp37-38, O'Reilly</ref> Initially it made no difference as [[Reg Simpson]] was bowled first ball by a [[full toss]] from [[Ray Lindwall]] (2/21). The veteran England [[scorer]] [[Bill Ferguson (cricket scorer)|Bill Ferguson]] was using his famous Ferguson Charts to record the details of each innings; how many runs a batsman had scored, how many balls, how many minutes, how many boundaries, etc; When Simpson was out one wag called out \"How long Bill, and how many fours?\" which produced a roar of laughter from the [[press box]] that astonished the crowd.<ref>p79, Kay</ref>\n\n[[Cyril Washbrook]] (6) and [[John Dewes]] (9) were determined to see out the day with dead bats and the wicket showed no signs of danger, but [[Sam Loxton]] took a superb catch to get rid of the Lancastrian (Washbrook) off Lindwall. [[Jack Iverson]] was called up to bowl his first Test over 27 minutes before stumps and had [[Trevor Bailey]] in all kinds of trouble as his poked and prodded and could have been out five or six times in the mystery spinner's maiden over. Dewes was bowled by [[Keith Miller]] and with one over from Iverson remaining, [[Alec Bedser]] came out and immediately appealed against the bad light, but was turned down as he had yet to face a ball.\n\nBedser holed out to [[Neil Harvey]] off Iverson, Bailey gave a simple catch to [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] and [[Godfrey Evans]] ran out his fellow wicket-keeper [[Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)|Arthur McIntyre]] when he called for an unnecessary third run.\n\nBrown had fed in [[Nightwatchman (cricket)|nightwatchman]] after nightwatchman in order to save Hutton, Compton and himself for the next day, but the [[Pudsey|Man from Pudsey]] still had to come out at 30/6 to survive the last two balls of an extraordinary day. When asked for his opinion that night Hutton said they might win \"if the others will stay till lunch and it doesn't rain again\".<ref>p137, Kay</ref> It did not rain again, but needing 163 to win with only four wickets in hand there was no room for mistakes.\n\nIn the morning Brown, the umpires and a stopwatch ensured that England got their full 10 minutes rolling at the start of the day, which took nearly half an hour to complete. Evans (5) helped Hutton add 16 runs before he was caught by Loxton off Bill Johnston (2/30). [[Denis Compton]] came to the crease, but lasted one ball as he departed like Evans \"c Loxton, b Johnston\".\n\nBrown came in at number 10 and held on grimly as Hutton peeled off 3 boundaries, though in the end the captain made 17 of their 29 runs together before he became Loxton's fourth victim when he was caught off Iverson (4/43).\n\n[[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] was the last man in at 77/9 and his batting tended to be a hit-and-miss affair which rarely reached double figures. Hutton (62 not out) farmed the bowling ruthlessly, making 43 of the 45 runs added for the last wicket. Wright managed to hold a straight bat up to the few balls he was left to face until the last four balls from Iverson before lunch. He kept out the first three, but spooned the last to [[Ray Lindwall]] at square leg and the match was over. The 12,000 strong crowd gave Hutton an heroic ovation and after lunch he replied to the congratulations showered on him with by admitting that \"with a bit of luck I'd have won the game\".<ref>pp84-93, Fingleton</ref><ref>p130, pp136-139, Kay</ref><ref>pp43-45, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Result===\n[[File:Operation Crossroads Baker Edit.jpg|thumb|left|Some blamed the rainstorm that wrecked the First Test on the American [[atomic bomb]] experiments at [[Bikini Atoll]].]]\n<blockquote>\n''Australia's cricket ego was in no way deflated by what happened at [[Brisbane]]. All teams have their bad days, and that generally was considered sufficient excuse for [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia's]] collapse for 228 on a plumb pitch: as for the other collapse \u2013 Australian cricket thought does not believe in pondering long over national deficiencies on a sticky pitch. The possibility of a wet pitch in Brisbane was suggested by other Tests there and the weather preceding the game.

His famously damaged knee had swollen up after making another century \u2013 115 vs an [[MCC tour of Australia in 1950-51#Australian XI vs MCC|Australian XI]] \u2013 and hourly bulletins were posted by the MCC manager [[Michael Green (cricketer, born 1891)|Brigadier Michael Green]] expressing optimistically that he would play in order to help draw a large crowd for the Test, though doubts where express by those who had seen him. In the end he was unfit to play and was replaced by the [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Welsh]] amateur batsmen [[Gilbert Parkhouse]] who had made 58 in the [[MCC tour of Australia in 1950-51#Australian XI vs MCC|Australian XI]] game, adding 130 with the luckless Compton. The reserve wicket-keeper [[Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)|Arthur McIntyre]] was also dropped from his batting role and the teenaged [[Brian Close]] was brought in as the best of a bad bunch, having hit 105 not out against [[long hop]]s and [[full toss]]es served up in a minor game. Brown thought that if nothing else as an [[all-rounder]] he could help take some of the strain off the other bowlers and so Close became the youngest Englishman to play Australia in a Test. [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] made only one change, dropping [[Jack Moroney]] for having made a pair in the First Test. His successor was chosen in the [[MCC tour of Australia in 1950-51#Australian XI vs MCC|Australian XI]] game and opener [[Ken Archer]] (12th man at Brisbane) was given his [[Baggy green|Baggy Green]] ahead of the middle order batsman [[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]] (who was made 12th man), although he had only made 81 to Burke's 128.

Hassett even apologised to Brown as the ball was constantly fell just short of the slips, or flew over their heads as Harvey rode his luck. After lunch Bedser tickled Harvey's edge with a ball that [[Godfrey Evans]] snapped up instinctively, but had he missed few would have realised was a chance. The big bowler then held onto [[Ken Archer]] (26) in the slips by throwing himself to the ground and taking the ball in his outstretched right hand and [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] were 89/3. [[Keith Miller]], whose [[Matinee idol|matin\u00e9e idol]] looks greatly affected his teenager fans, made 18, but his potential boundaries were stymied by [[Cyril Washbrook]] in the covers and [[Reg Simpson]] on the boundary-fence and he was trapped [[leg before wicket|lbw]] by [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] (1/28) to bring [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] down to 93/4 on a good pitch on a perfect sunny day.

[[Cyril Washbrook]] was joined by [[Len Hutton]] \u2013 still batting in the middle order \u2013 to re-establish their old partnership and set about restoring the innings. Washbrook (21) made some charming cover-drives before he was given out [[leg before wicket|lbw]] to [[Ray Lindwall]] (2/46), although only he and [[Don Tallon]] appealed and the other nine fielders remained silent. [[Jack Iverson]] was brought on and saw a ball flick off Hutton's pads as he checked a sweep (it was the over before lunch). Iverson yelled \"Catch it\", Tallon dived forwards to take the ball an inch off the ground and the bewildered opener was given out for 12.

Captain [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] and [[Gilbert Parkhouse]] returned to the crease after lunch and made the best of things, but the Welshman's stilt-like footwork was his undoing and he was caught by Hassett off Miller. He was replaced by [[Trevor Bailey]] who steadfastly defended at one end while his captain brought the crowd to its feet hitting Johnson straight down the ground for six and through the covers for four. He hit three more boundaries in his 62 and they added 65 for the seventh wicket. Bailey was out first, bowled by Lindwall and Brown was caught by Johnson off Iverson. [[Godfrey Evans]] hit Lindwall straight to the boundary and took 8 runs off Miller, which resulted in a bouncer, which the keeper dodged like a [[Boxing|boxer]], and the bowler being booed. Evans cracked another four past point off Miller, who was removed from the attack, and passed 1,000 runs in Tests, but was \"c Johnson, b Iverson\" for 49 and was cheered by the crowd when he left. [[Alec Bedser]] (5 not out) had batted for nearly an hour helping Evans, but [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] (2) only lasted five minutes and [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] were out for 197, exceeding [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia's]] First Innings by only 3 runs.

To be fair they had made 212 for the first wicket against the [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/19/19416.html West Indies at Trent Bridge] earlier in the year. On this occasion they added 21 against Lindwall and Miller when the spinners were brought on.

[[John Dewes]], coming in to bat from his sick bed like [[Eddie Paynter]] in the Fourth Test of 1932\u201333, stayed in for 46&nbsp;minutes making a gutsy 5 before falling to Iverson (2/36) at 82/4. In the lunch break [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] needed less than a hundred runs to win and there was an earnest discussion as to whether Hutton should bat in his usual careful way or should try to make the runs before he ran out of partners, as had happened at [[The Gabba|Brisbane]]. He decided on the latter and by forcing the pace struck out at Bill Johnston (4/26) and was caught at square leg for 40, which caused a deathly silence across the 50,000 strong crowd. As in the first innings [[Brian Close]] was soon out ([[leg before wicket|lbw]] to Johnston for 1), Brown was bowled by Lindwall, who then removed Evans \"with a ball which pitched outside the off stump, came in at a crazy angle and knocked back the off stump without leaving the turf by a centimetre\".<ref>p107, [[Keith Miller]], ''Cricket Crossfire'', Oldbourne Press, 1956</ref> [[Gilbert Parkhouse]], who batted manfully for 102 minutes and when he was out for 28 [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] were 134/9 and still needed 45 to win.

When he was finally out the next day, playing over a [[yorker]] from [[Ray Lindwall]] for 79, he had made his highest Test score, the highest for [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] so far in the series, and received a royal reception from the crowd. [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] was now 258/6, their highest innings of a low scoring series, but without their fiery captain they collapsed to 290 all out. Bailey had his thumb broken by a Lindwall [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] at 263/6 and was taken to [[St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne|St Vincent's Hospital]]. [[Godfrey Evans]] struck 3 fours in his 23 not out, but [[Alec Bedser]] was bowled by Lindwall (2/60) and [[John Warr]] by Miller (4/37). Bailey returned at 281/8 and tried to bat one-handed before he was caught by [[Don Tallon]] of Ian Johnson. [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] joined Evans, but was run out for a duck by his [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] team-mate, tripping over his bat and pulling a [[muscle]] as he rushed home and [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] were all out for 290.<ref>pp141-146, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp170-174, Kay</ref><ref>pp74-83, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Australia \u2013 First Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''[[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Brown]] had only himself and [[John Warr]] to bowl along with [[Alec Bedser|Bedser]], and there began a performance that for sheer determination and willingness to work must stand unrivalled in Test history, for it was essential that runs should be kept down as well as wickets taken...''\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref>p175, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[File:Miller cut.jpg|thumb|left|A famous photograph of [[Keith Miller]] cutting the ball on his way to 145 not out in the Third Test on his home ground at Sydney]]\nThe [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] bowling attack was badly depleted, [[Trevor Bailey]] was unfit to play and did not field and the leg-spinner [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]], who might have been a real handful on the turning [[Sydney Cricket Ground|Sydney]] wicket, played for only a few overs before retiring. The bowling thus fell heavily on the shoulders of [[Alec Bedser]], the 40-year-old captain [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] and debutant [[John Warr]]. They had no regular spinner and would have to rely on Brown's part-time leg-spin, the [[left-arm unorthodox spin]] of the injured [[Denis Compton]] and the comedy leg-breaks of [[Len Hutton]]. In the end Compton only bowled 6 overs and Hutton none; the bowling was completed by Bedser (43\u20134\u2013107\u20134), Warr (36\u20134\u2013142\u20130) and Brown (44\u20134\u2013153\u20134), bowling [[Over (cricket)|eight-ball overs]]. The innings began with [[John Warr]] bowling to [[Ken Archer]] as [[Arthur Morris]] always batted second and his [[archenemy|nemesis]] [[Alec Bedser]] bowled him with the first ball of the second over. Although [[Neil Harvey]] had made 74, 12, 42 and 31 batting at number 3 [[Lindsay Hassett]] finally saw that the left-handed strokemaker would fare better further down the order and came in himself. With rain expected over the weekend Brown set defensive fields and with the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] fielding on top form Archer (44 not out) and Hassett (62 not out) slowly batted out the day for 110/1 despite the constant barracking of the crowd, who shouted \"Get on with it!\". There was rain on the rest day, but most of it avoided the ground and it rolled out well. When play resumed the wicket took a lot of pace and bounce from the ball and [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] were doomed to a long day in the field. Even so [[Godfrey Evans]] took a brilliant catch off a leg-glance by Archer (48) off Bedser, who was involved in the first 6 wickets to fall. Brown bowled a leg-spinner that fizzed off the pitch and beat Hassett (70) and missed the stumps, but his next ball the Australian captain hit a catch to Bedser at mid-on and his team was 122/3. The presence of [[Neil Harvey]] and [[Keith Miller]] at the crease against a depleted bowling attack would usually ensure a flow of runs, but while Harvey hit 39 in 79&nbsp;minutes before being bowled by Bedser, Miller nudged his way at the funeral rate of 24 runs an hour. [[Sam Loxton]] survived a close [[run out]] when [[Cyril Washbrook]] brilliantly threw down his stumps, but was out for 17 when he hoisted a [[long hop]] from Brown into the hands of Bedser, who then caught [[Don Tallon]] [[leg before wicket|lbw]] for 18. At 252/6 [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] were still 38 runs behind when [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] came to the crease and started to hit the ball around in his top Test score of 77, he added 150 with Miller in the highest seventh wicket stand for Australia since [[Clem Hill]] and [[Hugh Trumble]] made 165 at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]] in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1897\u201398|1897\u201398]]. They took [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] past 300 and 400 for the first time in the series and Miller reached his century after 274&nbsp;minutes. Brown bowled Johnson, had Lindwall [[leg before wicket|lbw]] and had Australia 406/8. With the tail now in Miller lifted Warr for six, but ran out [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] and [[Jack Iverson]] to end the innings with his then highest Test score of 145 not out. He had taken [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] to 426 and gave them a lead of 136.<ref>pp146-148, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp174-178, Kay</ref><ref>pp83-94, O'Reilly</ref>\n[[File:DonTallon.jpg|thumb|[[Don Tallon]] deflected a ball from [[Jack Iverson]] to [[Len Hutton]] onto [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] at slip, then caught the rebound.]]\n\n===England \u2013 Second Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''When a bowler of [[Jack Iverson]]'s ability to control direction and length can spin the ball so far as that, no batsman is likely to give him trouble.

[[Lindsay Hassett]] soon took the off and brought on the spinners. [[Jack Iverson]] had not bowled in the first innings and with his negligible ability with the bat and in the field some thought he was due to be dropped. It was soon apparent that he was in complete control of the situation, his line and length were flawless and he was turning the ball from outside the off-stump past the leg-stump. He had Hutton out for 9, the ball was snicked behind, where the wicket-keeper [[Don Tallon]] knocked it to [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] in the slips who [[juggle]]d the ball and dropped it, upon which Tallon dived across and took the catch. [[Reg Simpson]] showed his usual bad form against spinners and was caught behind for a duck (even though Tallon did not appeal) and Washbrook was bowled for 34 after hitting two boundaries off Johnson. [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] were now 45/3 and Iverson had taken 3/2. [[Denis Compton]] avoided his pair and held out for 104&nbsp;minutes making 23, his highest score of a terrible series, before running out [[Gilbert Parkhouse]] for 18 and popping a catch to the hungry [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] off [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] (1/31). [[Godfrey Evans|Evans]] whacked 14 runs with 3 fours before Johnson (1/32) bowled him. [[Trevor Bailey]] bravely came out to bat with one hand in plaster, much to the surprise of his captain who asked \"What are the devil are you doing here, Trevor?\", Bailey replied \"I thought I would hold them up for a bit Skipper\"<ref>p112, [[Ray Lindwall]], ''Flying Stumps'', Marlin Books, 1977</ref> and held up one end with his 0 not out.

What went to pieces, of course, was the game itself.''\n:[[Jack Fingleton]]<ref name=\"p188, Fingleton\">p188, Fingleton</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAlthough [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] had wrapped up [[the Ashes]] there was still considerable interest in the series as many felt that [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown's]] team deserved a win for all their efforts. Since the Third Test they had won four games on the trot by 9 wickets, 10 wickets, an innings and 25 runs and 152 runs and morale was as high as it had ever been. After his dismal showing at [[Sydney Cricket Ground|Sydney]] the Australian vice-captain [[Arthur Morris]] asked to be dropped, he had been dismissed four times out of five by [[Alec Bedser]] (for 25, 0, 2 and 0) and was nicknamed \"Bedser's Bunny\". The selectors declined and instead dropped [[Sam Loxton]] after 11 consecutive Tests and brought in [[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]] of [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] to strengthen the lower order batting. Loxton was an outstanding fielder and was still brought to [[Adelaide]] as 12th man. [[Roy Tattersall]] of [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] had been flown out as a replacement for the injured [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] and was picked for his debut. This young [[off-spinner]] had topped the tables in 1950 with 193 wickets (13.59), including twenty 5-wicket and six 10-wicket hauls. The [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] players had been singing his praises since they arrived in Australia, so there was much curiosity about him down under. [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]]'s pulled leg-muscle has recovered and he would also play and Tattersall replaced [[Trevor Bailey]], whose broken thumb had not yet mended. [[Gilbert Parkhouse]] was dropped and replaced by his fellow amateur [[David Sheppard]] and despite taking 0/142 at [[Sydney Cricket Ground|Sydney]] [[John Warr]] was kept in the team. The [[Adelaide Oval]] was notorious for being the flattest wicket in Australia, but had taken spin from the first morning in the tour match when the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] (211 & 220) beat [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] (126 & 153) by 152 runs. Even so when [[Lindsay Hassett]] won the toss he made the easy decision to bat first.<ref>pp172-174, Fingleton</ref><ref>p174 & pp198-200, Kay</ref><ref>pp100-103, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Australia \u2013 First Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''[[Arthur Morris|Morris]] had become very fed up of hearing [[Alec Bedser|Bedser's]] name.

This, then, was a happy day for him. he had come back to the ranks of Test batsmen again.''\n:[[Jack Fingleton]]<ref>p176, Fingleton</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe first [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] wicket fell before a run was on the board for the third time in the series, but it was [[Ken Archer]] who succumbed to [[Alec Bedser]] when he glanced the third ball of the day to [[Denis Compton]] at short fine-leg, though he hung about the wicket even after he was given out by [[Andrew Barlow|Umpire Barlow]]. Having livened up the crowd the bowlers had a tough day as the [[Adelaide Oval]] was up to its usual standards. [[Arthur Morris]] batted a very careful and composed innings, the highest of his Test career as he laid his reputation as \"Bedser's Bunny\" to rest. He made 206 out of [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia's]] 371 before he was the last man out, spending 7 hours and 42&nbsp;minutes at the crease and striking 23 boundaries in the process. He passed 2,000 runs in Tests and made his seventh [[the Ashes|Ashes]] century in four years, overtaking [[Victor Trumper]] and [[Bill Woodfull]] placing him behind only [[Sir Donald Bradman]] on the list of Australian century-makers against [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]]. No other [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] batsman made 50, but he added 95 runs for the second wicket with [[Lindsay Hassett]] (43), 110 for the third wicket with [[Neil Harvey]] (44) and 76 for the fourth wicket with [[Keith Miller]] (44). Thereafter wickets fell sharply, the last five falling for 14 runs, and the innings ended when he was bowled by [[Roy Tattersall]] (3/95). The young [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] off-spinner had an impressive debut which justified his selection even though he had to borrow [[E.W. Swanton]]'s boots because his feet had swollen on the flight. He began by conceding only 5 runs from his first 6 overs and spun the ball so much that it floated across the wicket before turning on the unhelpful wicket. He dismissed fellow debutant [[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]] with a ball that he bowled at the leg stump so that Burke went down on one knee to sweep it, but it floated over the wicket and knocked over the off-stump. He also bowled [[Don Tallon]], getting his three wickets without any help from the fielders. [[Alec Bedser]] returned figures of 3/74, but Hassett protected Morris early in his innings and Miller hit his first over of the second day for 15. [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] took 4/99 and only Morris, a noted player of spinners, was able to master him, but [[John Warr]] (0/63) could still not take a wicket.<ref>pp174-178, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp200-205, Kay</ref><ref>pp103-107, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===England \u2013 First Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''The [[Yorkshireman]] was magnificent.

Hutton made 156 not out in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England's]] 272, hit 11 fours and nobody else made 30. [[Ray Lindwall]] (3/51) dismissed [[Cyril Washbrook]] for 2 when the pedestrian [[Jack Iverson]] took a high, leaping catch when the batsmen heaved the ball to the leg-side. The spinners were soon on and Hutton hit [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] for two boundaries. He went two yards down the wicket and was almost stumped by [[Don Tallon]] for 34, but he nicked the ball and the deflection made Tallon miss both the catch and the stumping. [[Reg Simpson]] was the second highest scorer with 29 and together they added 83 for the second wicket before Simpson was bowled by the left-arm bowler [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] and [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] finished the day 96/2. The following morning Lindwall and Miller argued with Tallon that he ought to stand three yards closer to the stumps as the pitch was so slow. He refused and Lindwall bowled at a reduced pace, so nudged by Miller Tallon moved up for the third ball, which nicked [[Denis Compton]]'s bat and the keeper took the catch low off the ground. Had he remained back Tallon could not have made the catch. The other [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] batsmen made a steady procession to and from the wicket as Bill Johnston (3/68) and Iverson (3/58) worked their way through the order as Hutton batted serenely on, now untouchable by any of the bowlers. [[David Sheppard]] almost ran Hutton out when he rushed down the wicket to get off the mark, [[Godfrey Evans]] tried to do the same, but Hutton wisely ignored him and the keeper scrambled back before his wicket was wrecked by Lindwall. [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] was caught [[Leg before wicket|leg before]] by Miller (1/30), who immediately appealed and [[Arthur Cocks (umpire)|Umpire Cocks]] gave him out, then the ball rolled back onto his stumps and knocked off a bail, so he ended up being bowled. Debutant [[Roy Tattersall]] was crowded by the [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] fielders and was caught by [[Neil Harvey]] off Iverson for a duck. [[John Warr]] was bowled for another duck by Bill Johnston.

There must be few people who did not welcome [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England's]] victory in the Fifth Test because it broke the monotonous string of Australian victories and sympathy was entirely with [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] and his men for the gallant performances they had put up throughout the tour.''\n:[[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]]<ref>p177, O'Reilly</ref>\n</blockquote>\nGoing into the final Test [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] dropped the luckless [[John Warr]] in favour of [[Trevor Bailey]] and [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] has recovered enough for him to retain his place as captain. The [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] selectors declined to use the game to test some new players and kept their team except to drop [[Ken Archer]] in favour of debutant [[Graeme Hole]]. [[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]] was promoted to open the innings with [[Arthur Morris]], even though he had failed as Morris' opening partner for [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] and had found success only as a middle order batsman. The players returned to [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]] \u2013 scene of the Second Test \u2013 as in those days [[Sydney Cricket Ground|Sydney]] and [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]] alternated having two Tests in [[the Ashes]] series. [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] played even though he had a foot infection, and was spared from bowling too much by Hassett. There had been thunderstorms in the week before the Test, and the outfield and bowler's run ups were soft. [[Lindsay Hassett]] won the toss as a matter of course and [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] batted first.<ref>p190, Fingleton</ref><ref>p221, Kay</ref><ref>pp125-130, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Australia \u2013 First Innings===\n[[File:Keith Miller.jpg|thumb|left|[[Keith Miller]] always called [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] \"C and B\" after the England captain had him was caught and bowled in both innings.<ref>p158, [[Keith Miller]], ''Cricket Crossfire'', Oldbourne Press, 1956</ref>]]\n<blockquote>\n''[[Jack Iverson|Iverson]], last man in, arrived on the scene with his old [[battle-axe]] bat. This bat, which must be one of the strangest ever to make an appearance in a Test match, is bolstered up with a solid slab of leather bound firmly round the blade. It has the colour of a very old [[violin]]. Its handle is so pliable that it can be twisted in all directions. It must have seen its best days when its owner was a little boy at school. It has been a scrap-heap job for years. But Iverson seldom places much strain upon it.''\n:[[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]]<ref>pp133-134, O'Reilly</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]] provided the customary early wicket to fall, caught by [[Roy Tattersall]] at forward short-leg off [[Alec Bedser]] after he swopped ends with [[Trevor Bailey]]. Regardless of his recent double-century at [[Adelaide Oval|Adelaide]] Morris (50) \"mistimed, misjudged and mishit\",<ref>p131, O'Reilly</ref> but managed to stay in as he and captain [[Lindsay Hassett]] (92) slowly increased the [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] innings. They were barracked heavily by the small crowd of 7,000 (in a stadium capable of holding 80,000) who wanted them to make way for the strokemakers [[Neil Harvey]] and [[Keith Miller]]. Their quality only became apparent when Morris was [[leg before wicket|lbw]] to [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Brown]] at 111/2, closely followed by Harvey caught behind on 114/3 and Miller caught-and-bowled on 123/4 to give the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] captain a spell of 3/0. The crowd increased to 20,000 as news of the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] success traveled during the day and people came into see the fun. Hassett continued to hold the innings together, but Bedser worked his way through the line-up, bowling [[Graeme Hole]] and catching [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] [[leg before wicket|lbw]]. [[Len Hutton]] took an excellent catch off Brown to dismiss the Australian captain 8 runs short of his century and another off Bedser to dispose of [[Don Tallon]]. [[Ray Lindwall]] (21) and [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] (12 not out) led a small fight back to get [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] from 187/8 to 206/8 at stumps and not for the first time [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] had the advantage on the first day. The injury-prone [[Trevor Bailey]] had fallen heavily when bowling and an X-ray over the weekend found that he had chipped a bone in his foot, but he came back to play. The second day was lost to heavy rain and fears of another [[The Gabba|Brisbane-like]] sticky rose, but the pitch dried out on the Sunday and flattened out nicely when pressed by the big electric roller on the Monday. Bedser (5/46) had Lindwall caught by Compton in second slip and Brown (5/49) had Iverson caught by Washbrook in the covers and the [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] innings closed on 217. It was Brown's best bowling and his only five-wicket haul in Tests.<ref>pp190-196, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp221-225, Kay</ref><ref>pp130-134, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===England \u2013 First Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''It was interesting to see the crowd's reaction to the English last-wicket partnership. They cheered every scoring shot and went into ecstasy over [[Roy Tattersall|Tattersall's]] efforts. It was quite obvious that they had decided to fight the battle out for [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] and were plainly partisan...There are many Australians, and I am one of them, who believe that cricket will reach its highest level again when England and Australia are on level pegging. These were the people who cheered the tenth-wicket partnership to the echo.''\n:[[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]]<ref>p143, O'Reilly</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe old firm of [[Len Hutton|Hutton]] and [[Cyril Washbrook|Washbrook]] opened for [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] and added 40 runs in 32&nbsp;minutes for the first wicket before Washbrook tickled a ball from [[Keith Miller]] into the gloves of [[Don Tallon]]. Brown thought that if the [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] bowling was attacked they would buckle under and [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] would get more runs, in any case Hutton hit 8 boundaries in his 79 and added 131 runs with [[Reg Simpson]] in 142&nbsp;minutes, the only century stand of the series for [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] . With Hutton in fine form the [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Notts]] opener was able to play himself in and at 171/1 the English batsmen were in finally in control. In desperation Hassett brought on debutant [[Graeme Hole]] to try out his off-spinners and to everyone's surprise his fourth ball clean bowled the England opener and the [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] bowling attack took an interest in affairs again. Lindwall (3/77) and Miller (4/76) bowled with greater speed and hostility than at any time in the series and by stumps [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] were 218/6 with [[Denis Compton|Compton]], [[David Sheppard|Sheppard]], [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Brown]] and [[Godfrey Evans|Evans]] all gone and Simpson (80 not out) left with [[Alec Bedser]] (3 not out). Lindwall bowled Bedser for 11 and [[Jack Iverson]] (2/40) disposed of [[Trevor Bailey]] and [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] to bring last man [[Roy Tattersall]] in at 246/9 with [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] just 18 runs ahead. With Simpson on 92 the main concern was whether he would reach 100 on this his 31st birthday, but this was soon resolved when he hit 11 runs off his next over from Miller. Hassett spread out the field to allow Simpson to take singles so they could concentrate on Tattersall, who was surrounded with close fielders. The young Lancastrian kept a straight bat and Simpson cracked 6 fours as they hit 50 runs in the 34&nbsp;minutes before lunch. Miller bowled Tattersall for 10 after the break and Simpson was left on 156 not out, his highest score in Tests and his greatest Test innings. Their stand added 74 runs in 55&nbsp;minutes and took [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] to 320, their only score of the series over 300, and a lead of 103 runs.<ref>pp196-202, Fingleton</ref><ref>p225-230, Kay</ref><ref>pp134-143, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===Australia \u2013 Second Innings===\n[[File:Graeme Hole 1949.jpg|thumb|[[Graeme Hole]] made 18 and 63 on his Test debut.]]\n<blockquote>\n''[[Alec Bedser|Bedser]] was given a wonderful ovation when he came off the field with five more wickets to his name, and a match record of 10 for 105 \u2013 just one more instance of proof furnished by the [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] man that on Australian wickets he is the world's outstanding pace bowler.''\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref>p231, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australian]] hopes that they could set [[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] a good target received an immediate double blow as [[Alec Bedser]] sent Morris and Burke straight back to the [[pavilion]]. [[Lindsay Hassett]] and [[Neil Harvey]] salvaged a stand of 81 from the wreckage of 6/2, with Harvey swashbuckling his way to 52 in what [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] thought was his best innings of the series. He was torpedoed by a shooter from [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] (3/56) and [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] (1/32) caught and bowled [[Keith Miller]] for a duck to leave them 89/4. Hassett found another partner in [[Graeme Hole]] and saw out the day at 129/4, but was skittled in the morning for 48 \u2013 [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]]'s 100th test wicket \u2013 when a leg-spinner zipped one past his bat and toppled his off-stump. Wright finally showed why he was so feared on the county circuit when [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] lofted a googly to Brown at mid-off. [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|Australia]] were now 142/6, a mere 39 runs ahead, but Hole stood steady for three hours making 63 until he was bowled by [[Trevor Bailey]] (1/32). Brown figured that if anybody deserved some easy wickets it was Bedser and the big [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] bowler removed Lindwall, Johnston and Iverson for five runs and ending his superb tour with 5/59, 10/105 in the match. His 30 wickets (16.06) was the most by an English bowler in Australia since [[Harold Larwood]]'s 33 wickets (19.51) in 1932\u201333.<ref>pp202-208, Fingleton</ref><ref>p230-231, Kay</ref><ref>pp143-150, O'Reilly</ref>\n\n===England \u2013 Second Innings===\n<blockquote>\n''Not once, but three times, the stumps were plucked by players eager to grab [[souvenir]]s of an historic occasion.

He forgot that Compton was out of form and out of luck. Instead of the ball going to the rails, it was missed completely and poor [[Don Tallon|Tallon]], with his arms full of stumps and bails, had to drop the lot and take the ball.''\n:[[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]]<ref>pp218-219, Kay</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[English cricket team in Australia in 1950-51|England]] needed 95 runs to win and \"an [[earthquake]] would not have shaken [[Len Hutton|Hutton's]] determination not to be out when until victory was gained\".<ref>P219, Kay</ref> he made 60 not out, his fifth innings over 50 and fourth unbeaten innings of the series and hit the winning runs. Washbrook (7) and Simpson (15) did not last the pace, but [[Denis Compton]] finally had some luck as he made 11 not out. [[Lindsay Hassett]] bowled the last over with the fielders crowded round the batsman, not in the hope of a catch, but so they could fight [[Don Tallon]] and the umpire for [[souvenir]] stumps and bails. They jumped the gun twice, once when Hassett bowled a rank [[full toss]] down the leg side, expecting [[Denis Compton]] to sweep it to the boundary, so did the umpire who called no ball and grabbed two stumps, Hassett the other and Tallon three, but the Compton missed, Tallon dropped his stumps as he jumped on the ball and they had to start again. The next ball was a single, then with one run to win [[Len Hutton|Hutton]] amused himself by smothering a full toss amidst the chaos. Play was held up until [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] returned a bail he had hidden in his pocket. Finally, Compton pulled a stump out the ground and ran down the wicket as Hutton pushed the ball wide of square-leg and trotted over the crease to be congratulated by Hassett while Tallon fought off the close fielders for the stumps. The English batsmen were cheered off the pitch and they shouted for Brown to give them a speech, which he did, giving particular thanks to [[Len Hutton]] and [[Alec Bedser]].

They played several games on the tour against minor teams and schools, including a [[Christmas Eve]] charity match against [[Bill Ponsford|Bill Ponford's XI]] which presented [[Australian pounds|\u00a31,000]] to a nursing charity and games against schoolboy teams in [[Perth]], [[Brisbane]], [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide]]. The radio commentators included the Australian captain [[Vic Richardson]] and [[Arthur Gilligan]] the popular England captain of the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1924\u201325|1924\u201325 Ashes series]]. Gilligan's \"What do you think, Vic?\" was inevitably followed by Richardson's \"I dunno, what do you think, Arthur?\", which became an Australian [[catchphrase]].<ref>pp97-98, Fingleton</ref><ref>pp75-80, Kay</ref><ref>p103, O'Reilly</ref><ref>p81, Swanton</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [[Jack Fingleton|J.H.
