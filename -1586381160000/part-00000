Apart from primary role, all CAPFs are involved in assisting Police in Law & Order situations and also Army in Counter Terrorist Operations. BSF & CRPF have assisted army during external aggression in the past. CAPFs work along with both Army & Police in different roles assigned to them.\n\nCentral Armed Police Forces personnel also serve in various important organisations such as [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW), [[Special Protection Group]] (SPG), [[National Investigation Agency]] (NIA), [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]]  (IB), [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI), [[National Disaster Response Force]] (NDRF), [[Narcotics Control Bureau]] (NCB) and [[Indian Army]] on deputation. Their role and performance, therefore, assumes a great significance due to the special features of an emergency force which is pressed in aid to civil power to perform multiple roles in extremely difficult situations.\n\n== Recruitment, Ranks and Structure ==\nRecruitment of candidates to the CAPFs may be conducted by the [[Union Public Service Commission]], the [[Staff Selection Commission]] or the respective service HQs depending on the post to be filled. There are three possible pathways for recruitment to the CAPFs:\n\n===Gazetted officers===\nOfficers in CAPFs are recruited through the Central Armed Police Forces (Assistant Commandants) Examination conducted by UPSC. They are appointed as Assistant Commandants and are Gazetted Officers generally referred to as DAGOs (Directly Appointed Gazetted Officers). DEGOs (Departmental Entry Gazetted Officers) are those officers who have been promoted through departmental exams conducted internally for Subordinate Officers.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''

Apart from primary role, all CAPFs are involved in assisting Police in Law & Order situations and also Army in Counter Terrorist Operations. BSF & CRPF have assisted army during external aggression in the past. CAPFs work along with both Army & Police in different roles assigned to them.\n\nCentral Armed Police Forces personnel also serve in various important organisations such as [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW), [[Special Protection Group]] (SPG), [[National Investigation Agency]] (NIA), [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]]  (IB), [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI), [[National Disaster Response Force]] (NDRF), [[Narcotics Control Bureau]] (NCB) and [[Indian Army]] on deputation. Their role and performance, therefore, assumes a great significance due to the special features of an emergency force which is pressed in aid to civil power to perform multiple roles in extremely difficult situations.\n\n== Recruitment, Ranks and Structure ==\nRecruitment of candidates to the CAPFs may be conducted by the [[Union Public Service Commission]], the [[Staff Selection Commission]] or the respective service HQs depending on the post to be filled. There are three possible pathways for recruitment to the CAPFs:\n\n===Gazetted officers===\nOfficers in CAPFs are recruited through the Central Armed Police Forces (Assistant Commandants) Examination conducted by UPSC. They are appointed as Assistant Commandants and are Gazetted Officers generally referred to as DAGOs (Directly Appointed Gazetted Officers). DEGOs (Departmental Entry Gazetted Officers) are those officers who have been promoted through departmental exams conducted internally for Subordinate Officers.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''

The newspaper reported that his legal advice declared the Withdrawal agreement's backstop protocol would mean the UK being indefinitely locked into a customs union with the EU if future negotiations collapse and that the only way the UK could leave the Backstop would be the signing of a future trade deal which could take many years to complete. The former [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union|Brexit Secretary]] [[Dominic Raab]] and three serving Cabinet members confirmed the contents of the letter to the ''Sunday Times''.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Shipman |title=Revealed: Brexit legal advice could sink Theresa May |url= https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/revealed-brexit-legal-advice-could-sink-theresa-may-r9wmh0v89 |work=The Sunday Times |location= London |date=2 December 2018 }}{{subscription}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2019, Theresa May placed Cox in charge of negotiating changes to the [[Northern Ireland backstop]] in the [[European Union|EU]] [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|withdrawal agreement]].<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47409659 |title=May's fate in the hands of the 'showman' |work=BBC News |last=Watt |first=Nicholas |date=28 February 2019 |access-date=6 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 September 2019, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] ruled unanimously that Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]]'s [[2019 British prorogation controversy|prorogation of parliament]] was unlawful overturning the High Court\u2019s judgment, given by the Lord Chief Justice, in the government\u2019s favour. On the same day, minutes of a conference call between cabinet ministers (which included Cox) were leaked to [[Sky News]]. The minutes of the call, which took place after the prorogation had been approved by the Queen, detailed that Cox briefly told the cabinet at that time that in his view the prorogation was lawful and constitutional and that any accusations of unlawfulness \"were motivated by political considerations\".

He stated his opposition to the highly politicised US selection process of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and suggested he preferred the Canadian system. Cox said  that \"there's a case for looking at how supreme court judges are appointed...

Cox registered the payments late, variously between two and seven months after the deadline; he said that he had omitted to prioritise the rule in the midst of an intense political and professional schedule. When first registering the payments, in September 2015, Cox drew attention to and apologised to the Registrar for his omission, referring himself to the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards|Parliamentary Commissioner]], and stepped down from the Committee.\n\nThe Commissioner and the Committee accepted that the payments had not in fact given rise to any conflicts of interest, and that the failure to register the payments within 28 days had thus had no practical effect.
