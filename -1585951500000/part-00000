It is the [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|third-largest city]] in British Columbia by population, surpassed only by Vancouver and nearby [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]]. Burnaby was incorporated in 1892 and achieved its City status in 1992, 100 years after incorporation. It is the seat of Metro Vancouver's regional government.\n\nThe city is served by the [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line]] and the [[Millennium Line]]. [[Metrotown station]] in downtown [[Metrotown, Burnaby|Metrotown]] is the second-busiest station in regional Vancouver's [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|Skytrain]] system as of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vancourier.com/news/new-pedestrian-bridge-will-connect-metrotown-skytrain-station-with-mall-1.23814718|title=New pedestrian bridge will connect Metrotown Skytrain Station with mall|first=Elana|last=Shepert|website=Vancouver Courier}}</ref>\n\nThe main campuses of [[Simon Fraser University]] and the [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]] are located in Burnaby. [[Metropolis at Metrotown]] is the largest mall in British Columbia. It is home to high-tech companies such as [[Ballard Power Systems|Ballard Power]] ([[fuel cell]]), [[Clio (software company)|Clio]] (legal software), [[D-Wave Systems|D-Wave]] ([[quantum computing]]), [[General Fusion]] ([[fusion power]]), and [[Capcom|Capcom Canada]].\n\n==History==\nAt incorporation, the municipality's citizens unanimously chose to name it after the legislator, speaker, [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and explorer [[Robert Burnaby]], who had been private secretary to Colonel [[Richard Moody]], the first land commissioner for the [[Colony of British Columbia]], in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{Cite bcgnis|id=2210 |title=Burnaby (city)}}</ref><ref name = Akrigg>{{Citation | last =Akrigg | first =G.P.V. | last2 =Akrigg | first2 =Helen B. | title =British Columbia Place Names | place =Vancouver | publisher =UBC Press | year =1986 | edition =3rd, 1997 | isbn =0-7748-0636-2 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/britishcolumbiap0000akri_w1q9 }}</ref>{{rp|33}}  In 1859 Burnaby had surveyed the freshwater lake near what is now the city's geographical centre. Moody chose to name it [[Burnaby Lake]].\n\nIn the first 30 to 40 years after its incorporation, the growth of Burnaby was influenced by its location between the expanding urban centres of Vancouver and [[New Westminster]]. It was developed as a rural agricultural area supplying nearby markets. Later, it served as an important transportation corridor between Vancouver, the [[Fraser Valley]] and the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior]], and continues to do so.\n\nAs Vancouver expanded and became a metropolis, Burnaby was one of the first-tier bedroom-community [[suburbs]] of Vancouver, along with [[North Vancouver (city)|the city]] and [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|district of North Vancouver]], and [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]]. During the suburbanization of Burnaby, \"Mid-Century Vernacular\" homes were built by the hundreds to satisfy demand by new residents, and these houses are still very common in the city. Burnaby has gradually become more urban in character.\n\n==Geography and land use==\n[[File:RoyalOakBurnabyWinter2016.jpg|thumb|[[Capitol Hill, Burnaby|Capitol Hill]] and the North Shore mountains as seen from Deer Lake Park]]\n\nBurnaby occupies {{convert|98.60|sqkm}} and is located at the geographic centre of the [[Metro Vancouver]] area and home to the Metro Vancouver regional government in [[Metrotown, Burnaby|Metrotown]]. Situated between the city of Vancouver on the west and [[Port Moody]], [[Coquitlam]], and [[New Westminster]] on the east, Burnaby is bounded by [[Burrard Inlet]] and the [[Fraser River]] on the north and south, respectively. Burnaby, Vancouver and New Westminster collectively occupy the major portion of the [[Burrard Peninsula]]. The elevation of Burnaby ranges from sea level to a maximum of {{convert|370|m}} atop [[Burnaby Mountain]]. Due to its elevation, the city of Burnaby typically has quite a bit more snowfall during the winter months than nearby Vancouver or Richmond. Overall, the physical landscape of Burnaby is one of hills, ridges, valleys and an alluvial plain. The land features and their relative locations have had an influence on the location, type and form of development in the city.\n\nBurnaby is home to many industrial and commercial firms. British Columbia's largest (and Canada's second largest) commercial mall, the [[Metropolis at Metrotown]], is located in Burnaby. Still, Burnaby's ratio of park land to residents is one of the highest in North America. It also maintains some agricultural land, particularly along the Fraser foreshore flats in the Big Bend neighbourhood along its southern perimeter.\n\n===Burnaby parks, rivers, and lakes===\nMajor parklands and waterways in Burnaby include [[Central Park (Burnaby)|Central Park]], [[Robert Burnaby Park]], [[Kensington Park (Burnaby)|Kensington Park]], [[Burnaby Mountain]], [[Still Creek]], the [[Brunette River]], [[Burnaby Lake Regional Park|Burnaby Lake]], [[Deer Lake (British Columbia)|Deer Lake]], and [[Squint Lake]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Simon Fraser University weather station is located {{convert|365|m}} above sea level on Burnaby Mountain. It records the climate as significantly cooler and wetter, with more snowfall, as compared to the rest of the city.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Burnaby ([[Simon Fraser University]]) 1981\u22122010 at 365 metres\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 16.5\n|Feb record high C = 18.5\n|Mar record high C = 23.0\n|Apr record high C = 28.0\n|May record high C = 33.0\n|Jun record high C = 31.1\n|Jul record high C = 34.0\n|Aug record high C = 33.9\n|Sep record high C = 34.5\n|Oct record high C = 26.5\n|Nov record high C = 19.4\n|Dec record high C = 16.1\n|year record high C = 34.5\n|Jan high C = 5.8\n|Feb high C = 6.8\n|Mar high C = 9.3\n|Apr high C = 12.4\n|May high C = 15.6\n|Jun high C = 18.2\n|Jul high C = 21.2\n|Aug high C = 21.2\n|Sep high C = 18.0\n|Oct high C = 12.0\n|Nov high C = 7.5\n|Dec high C = 5.1\n|year high C = 12.7\n|Jan mean C = 3.6\n|Feb mean C = 4.3\n|Mar mean C = 6.2\n|Apr mean C = 8.7\n|May mean C = 11.8\n|Jun mean C = 14.4\n|Jul mean C = 17.0\n|Aug mean C = 17.2\n|Sep mean C = 14.6\n|Oct mean C = 9.5\n|Nov mean C = 5.3\n|Dec mean C = 2.9\n|year mean C = 9.6\n|Jan low C = 1.4\n|Feb low C = 1.7\n|Mar low C = 3.1\n|Apr low C = 4.9\n|May low C = 7.9\n|Jun low C = 10.5\n|Jul low C = 12.7\n|Aug low C = 13.2\n|Sep low C = 11.1\n|Oct low C = 7.0\n|Nov low C = 3.0\n|Dec low C = 0.8\n|year low C = 6.5\n|Jan record low C = \u221213.9\n|Feb record low C = \u221214.0\n|Mar record low C = \u22128.0\n|Apr record low C = \u22123.3\n|May record low C = -0.5\n|Jun record low C = 3.9\n|Jul record low C = 5.0\n|Aug record low C = 3.3\n|Sep record low C = 2.0\n|Oct record low C = \u22127.0\n|Nov record low C = \u221214.0\n|Dec record low C = \u221219.4\n|year record low C = \u221219.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 280.9\n|Feb precipitation mm = 178.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 182.1\n|Apr precipitation mm = 154.4\n|May precipitation mm = 120.0\n|Jun precipitation mm = 101.4\n|Jul precipitation mm = 64.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 64.5\n|Sep precipitation mm = 92.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 210.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 311.6\n|Dec precipitation mm = 249.8\n|year precipitation mm = 2009.9\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 256.5\n|Feb rain mm = 163.2\n|Mar rain mm = 171.2\n|Apr rain mm = 152.7\n|May rain mm = 119.9\n|Jun rain mm = 101.4\n|Jul rain mm = 64.7\n|Aug rain mm = 64.5\n|Sep rain mm = 92.2\n|Oct rain mm = 209.8\n|Nov rain mm = 303.6\n|Dec rain mm = 220.8\n|year rain mm = 1920.7\n|snow colour = \n|Jan snow cm = 24.3\n|Feb snow cm = 15.1\n|Mar snow cm = 10.9\n|Apr snow cm = 1.7\n|May snow cm = 0.1\n|Jun snow cm = 0.0\n|Jul snow cm = 0.0\n|Aug snow cm = 0.0\n|Sep snow cm = 0.0\n|Oct snow cm = 0.2\n|Nov snow cm = 8.0\n|Dec snow cm = 29.0\n|year snow cm = 89.3\n|unit precipitation days = 0.2 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 20.5\n|Feb precipitation days = 16.2\n|Mar precipitation days = 18.9\n|Apr precipitation days = 16.1\n|May precipitation days = 14.9\n|Jun precipitation days = 13.5\n|Jul precipitation days = 7.4\n|Aug precipitation days = 6.8\n|Sep precipitation days = 10.3\n|Oct precipitation days = 17.1\n|Nov precipitation days = 21.6\n|Dec precipitation days = 19.8\n|year precipitation days = 183.1\n|unit rain days = 0.2 mm\n|Jan rain days = 18.1\n|Feb rain days = 14.7\n|Mar rain days = 18.3\n|Apr rain days = 16.0\n|May rain days = 14.9\n|Jun rain days = 13.5\n|Jul rain days = 7.4\n|Aug rain days = 6.8\n|Sep rain days = 10.3\n|Oct rain days = 17.0\n|Nov rain days = 21.0\n|Dec rain days = 17.3\n|year rain days = 175.4\n|unit snow days = 0.2&nbsp;cm\n|Jan snow days = 4.0\n|Feb snow days = 2.5\n|Mar snow days = 2.0\n|Apr snow days = 0.54\n|May snow days = 0.04\n|Jun snow days = 0.0\n|Jul snow days = 0.0\n|Aug snow days = 0.0\n|Sep snow days = 0.0\n|Oct snow days = 0.09\n|Nov snow days = 1.8\n|Dec snow days = 4.5\n|year snow days = 15.5\n|source 1 = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name=\"climate\">{{cite web\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=731&lang=e&province=BC&provSubmit=go&page=26&dCode=0\n| title = Burnaby, British Columbia\n| work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010\n| access-date = February 17, 2015}}</ref>\n|date=April 2012\n}}\n\n==Transportation==\n{{wide image|Burnaby skyline January 18 2019.jpeg|800px|alt=|Burnaby, seen from [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]]}}\n\nThe [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] rapid transit system, based in Burnaby, crosses the city from east to west in two places: the [[Expo Line (TransLink)|Expo Line]] (completed in 1986) crosses the south along Kingsway and the [[Millennium Line]] (completed in 2002) follows [[Lougheed Highway]]. The SkyTrain has encouraged closer connections to [[New Westminster]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], as well as dense urban development at [[Lougheed Town Centre]] on the city's eastern border, at [[Brentwood Town Centre]] in the centre-west and, most notably, at [[Metrotown, Burnaby|Metrotown]] in the south.\n\nMajor north\u2013south streets crossing the City include Boundary Road, Willingdon Avenue, Royal Oak Avenue, Kensington Avenue, Sperling Avenue, Gaglardi Way, Cariboo Road, and North Road. East\u2013west routes linking Burnaby's neighbouring cities to each other include [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|Hastings Street]], [[British Columbia Highway 7A|Barnet Highway]], the [[British Columbia Highway 7|Lougheed Highway]], [[Kingsway (Vancouver)|Kingsway]] (which follows the old horse trail between Vancouver and New Westminster), Canada Way and Marine Drive/Marine Way.

It is the third most populated urban centre in British Columbia (after Vancouver and Surrey) with an estimated population of 249,197 (2017).\n\nSimilar to Greater Vancouver, Burnaby has always had diverse ethnic and immigrant communities. For example, North Burnaby near Hastings Street has long been home to many [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] restaurants and recreational [[bocce]] games. [[Metrotown, Burnaby|Metrotown]]'s high-rise condominium towers in the south have been fuelled in part by recent arrivals from China ([[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]), Taiwan, and South Korea. According to the 2006 Census, 54% of Burnaby residents have a mother tongue that is neither English nor French.\n\nPolitically, Burnaby has maintained a left-wing city council closely affiliated with the provincial [[British Columbia New Democratic Party|NDP]] and school board for many years, while sometimes electing more conservative legislators provincially (for the [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit]] and [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal]] parties) and federally (for the [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform]], [[Canadian Alliance|Alliance]], and [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] parties). Its longest-serving politician had been [[Svend Robinson]] of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP), Canada's first openly [[gay]] member of Parliament, but after 25 years and seven elections he resigned his post in early 2004 after stealing and then returning an expensive ring. Burnaby voters endorsed his assistant, [[Bill Siksay]], as his replacement in the spring 2004 Canadian federal election. In the [[2013 British Columbia general election|May 2013 provincial election]], residents of the city sent 3 NDP MLAs and one Liberal MLA to the British Columbia legislature.

Vancouver]] and immediately to the east of the City of [[Vancouver]]. It is the [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|third-largest city]] in British Columbia by population, surpassed only by Vancouver and nearby [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]]. Burnaby was incorporated in 1892 and achieved its City status in 1992, 100 years after incorporation. It is the seat of Metro Vancouver's regional government.\n\nThe city is served by the [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line]] and the [[Millennium Line]]. [[Metrotown station]] in downtown [[Metrotown, Burnaby|Metrotown]] is the second-busiest station in regional Vancouver's [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|Skytrain]] system as of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vancourier.com/news/new-pedestrian-bridge-will-connect-metrotown-skytrain-station-with-mall-1.23814718|title=New pedestrian bridge will connect Metrotown Skytrain Station with mall|first=Elana|last=Shepert|website=Vancouver Courier}}</ref>\n\nThe main campuses of [[Simon Fraser University]] and the [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]] are located in Burnaby. [[Metropolis at Metrotown]] is the largest mall in British Columbia. It is home to high-tech companies such as [[Ballard Power Systems|Ballard Power]] ([[fuel cell]]), [[Clio (software company)|Clio]] (legal software), [[D-Wave Systems|D-Wave]] ([[quantum computing]]), [[General Fusion]] ([[fusion power]]), and [[Capcom|Capcom Canada]].\n\n==History==\nAt incorporation, the municipality's citizens unanimously chose to name it after the legislator, speaker, [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and explorer [[Robert Burnaby]], who had been private secretary to Colonel [[Richard Moody]], the first land commissioner for the [[Colony of British Columbia]], in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{Cite bcgnis|id=2210 |title=Burnaby (city)}}</ref><ref name = Akrigg>{{Citation | last =Akrigg | first =G.P.V. | last2 =Akrigg | first2 =Helen B. | title =British Columbia Place Names | place =Vancouver | publisher =UBC Press | year =1986 | edition =3rd, 1997 | isbn =0-7748-0636-2 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/britishcolumbiap0000akri_w1q9 }}</ref>{{rp|33}}  In 1859 Burnaby had surveyed the freshwater lake near what is now the city's geographical centre. Moody chose to name it [[Burnaby Lake]].\n\nIn the first 30 to 40 years after its incorporation, the growth of Burnaby was influenced by its location between the expanding urban centres of Vancouver and [[New Westminster]]. It was developed as a rural agricultural area supplying nearby markets. Later, it served as an important transportation corridor between Vancouver, the [[Fraser Valley]] and the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior]], and continues to do so.\n\nAs Vancouver expanded and became a metropolis, Burnaby was one of the first-tier bedroom-community [[suburbs]] of Vancouver, along with [[North Vancouver (city)|the city]] and [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|district of North Vancouver]], and [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]]. During the suburbanization of Burnaby, \"Mid-Century Vernacular\" homes were built by the hundreds to satisfy demand by new residents, and these houses are still very common in the city. Burnaby has gradually become more urban in character.\n\n==Geography and land use==\n[[File:RoyalOakBurnabyWinter2016.jpg|thumb|[[Capitol Hill, Burnaby|Capitol Hill]] and the North Shore mountains as seen from Deer Lake Park]]\n\nBurnaby occupies {{convert|98.60|sqkm}} and is located at the geographic centre of the [[Metro Vancouver]] area and home to the Metro Vancouver regional government in [[Metrotown, Burnaby|Metrotown]]. Situated between the city of Vancouver on the west and [[Port Moody]], [[Coquitlam]], and [[New Westminster]] on the east, Burnaby is bounded by [[Burrard Inlet]] and the [[Fraser River]] on the north and south, respectively. Burnaby, Vancouver and New Westminster collectively occupy the major portion of the [[Burrard Peninsula]]. The elevation of Burnaby ranges from sea level to a maximum of {{convert|370|m}} atop [[Burnaby Mountain]]. Due to its elevation, the city of Burnaby typically has quite a bit more snowfall during the winter months than nearby Vancouver or Richmond. Overall, the physical landscape of Burnaby is one of hills, ridges, valleys and an alluvial plain. The land features and their relative locations have had an influence on the location, type and form of development in the city.\n\nBurnaby is home to many industrial and commercial firms. British Columbia's largest (and Canada's second largest) commercial mall, the [[Metropolis at Metrotown]], is located in Burnaby. Still, Burnaby's ratio of park land to residents is one of the highest in North America. It also maintains some agricultural land, particularly along the Fraser foreshore flats in the Big Bend neighbourhood along its southern perimeter.\n\n===Burnaby parks, rivers, and lakes===\nMajor parklands and waterways in Burnaby include [[Central Park (Burnaby)|Central Park]], [[Robert Burnaby Park]], [[Kensington Park (Burnaby)|Kensington Park]], [[Burnaby Mountain]], [[Still Creek]], the [[Brunette River]], [[Burnaby Lake Regional Park|Burnaby Lake]], [[Deer Lake (British Columbia)|Deer Lake]], and [[Squint Lake]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Simon Fraser University weather station is located {{convert|365|m}} above sea level on Burnaby Mountain. It records the climate as significantly cooler and wetter, with more snowfall, as compared to the rest of the city.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Burnaby ([[Simon Fraser University]]) 1981\u22122010 at 365 metres\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 16.5\n|Feb record high C = 18.5\n|Mar record high C = 23.0\n|Apr record high C = 28.0\n|May record high C = 33.0\n|Jun record high C = 31.1\n|Jul record high C = 34.0\n|Aug record high C = 33.9\n|Sep record high C = 34.5\n|Oct record high C = 26.5\n|Nov record high C = 19.4\n|Dec record high C = 16.1\n|year record high C = 34.5\n|Jan high C = 5.8\n|Feb high C = 6.8\n|Mar high C = 9.3\n|Apr high C = 12.4\n|May high C = 15.6\n|Jun high C = 18.2\n|Jul high C = 21.2\n|Aug high C = 21.2\n|Sep high C = 18.0\n|Oct high C = 12.0\n|Nov high C = 7.5\n|Dec high C = 5.1\n|year high C = 12.7\n|Jan mean C = 3.6\n|Feb mean C = 4.3\n|Mar mean C = 6.2\n|Apr mean C = 8.7\n|May mean C = 11.8\n|Jun mean C = 14.4\n|Jul mean C = 17.0\n|Aug mean C = 17.2\n|Sep mean C = 14.6\n|Oct mean C = 9.5\n|Nov mean C = 5.3\n|Dec mean C = 2.9\n|year mean C = 9.6\n|Jan low C = 1.4\n|Feb low C = 1.7\n|Mar low C = 3.1\n|Apr low C = 4.9\n|May low C = 7.9\n|Jun low C = 10.5\n|Jul low C = 12.7\n|Aug low C = 13.2\n|Sep low C = 11.1\n|Oct low C = 7.0\n|Nov low C = 3.0\n|Dec low C = 0.8\n|year low C = 6.5\n|Jan record low C = \u221213.9\n|Feb record low C = \u221214.0\n|Mar record low C = \u22128.0\n|Apr record low C = \u22123.3\n|May record low C = -0.5\n|Jun record low C = 3.9\n|Jul record low C = 5.0\n|Aug record low C = 3.3\n|Sep record low C = 2.0\n|Oct record low C = \u22127.0\n|Nov record low C = \u221214.0\n|Dec record low C = \u221219.4\n|year record low C = \u221219.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 280.9\n|Feb precipitation mm = 178.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 182.1\n|Apr precipitation mm = 154.4\n|May precipitation mm = 120.0\n|Jun precipitation mm = 101.4\n|Jul precipitation mm = 64.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 64.5\n|Sep precipitation mm = 92.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 210.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 311.6\n|Dec precipitation mm = 249.8\n|year precipitation mm = 2009.9\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 256.5\n|Feb rain mm = 163.2\n|Mar rain mm = 171.2\n|Apr rain mm = 152.7\n|May rain mm = 119.9\n|Jun rain mm = 101.4\n|Jul rain mm = 64.7\n|Aug rain mm = 64.5\n|Sep rain mm = 92.2\n|Oct rain mm = 209.8\n|Nov rain mm = 303.6\n|Dec rain mm = 220.8\n|year rain mm = 1920.7\n|snow colour = \n|Jan snow cm = 24.3\n|Feb snow cm = 15.1\n|Mar snow cm = 10.9\n|Apr snow cm = 1.7\n|May snow cm = 0.1\n|Jun snow cm = 0.0\n|Jul snow cm = 0.0\n|Aug snow cm = 0.0\n|Sep snow cm = 0.0\n|Oct snow cm = 0.2\n|Nov snow cm = 8.0\n|Dec snow cm = 29.0\n|year snow cm = 89.3\n|unit precipitation days = 0.2 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 20.5\n|Feb precipitation days = 16.2\n|Mar precipitation days = 18.9\n|Apr precipitation days = 16.1\n|May precipitation days = 14.9\n|Jun precipitation days = 13.5\n|Jul precipitation days = 7.4\n|Aug precipitation days = 6.8\n|Sep precipitation days = 10.3\n|Oct precipitation days = 17.1\n|Nov precipitation days = 21.6\n|Dec precipitation days = 19.8\n|year precipitation days = 183.1\n|unit rain days = 0.2 mm\n|Jan rain days = 18.1\n|Feb rain days = 14.7\n|Mar rain days = 18.3\n|Apr rain days = 16.0\n|May rain days = 14.9\n|Jun rain days = 13.5\n|Jul rain days = 7.4\n|Aug rain days = 6.8\n|Sep rain days = 10.3\n|Oct rain days = 17.0\n|Nov rain days = 21.0\n|Dec rain days = 17.3\n|year rain days = 175.4\n|unit snow days = 0.2&nbsp;cm\n|Jan snow days = 4.0\n|Feb snow days = 2.5\n|Mar snow days = 2.0\n|Apr snow days = 0.54\n|May snow days = 0.04\n|Jun snow days = 0.0\n|Jul snow days = 0.0\n|Aug snow days = 0.0\n|Sep snow days = 0.0\n|Oct snow days = 0.09\n|Nov snow days = 1.8\n|Dec snow days = 4.5\n|year snow days = 15.5\n|source 1 = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name=\"climate\">{{cite web\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=731&lang=e&province=BC&provSubmit=go&page=26&dCode=0\n| title = Burnaby, British Columbia\n| work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010\n| access-date = February 17, 2015}}</ref>\n|date=April 2012\n}}\n\n==Transportation==\n{{wide image|Burnaby skyline January 18 2019.jpeg|800px|alt=|Burnaby, seen from [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]]}}\n\nThe [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] rapid transit system, based in Burnaby, crosses the city from east to west in two places: the [[Expo Line (TransLink)|Expo Line]] (completed in 1986) crosses the south along Kingsway and the [[Millennium Line]] (completed in 2002) follows [[Lougheed Highway]]. The SkyTrain has encouraged closer connections to [[New Westminster]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], as well as dense urban development at [[Lougheed Town Centre]] on the city's eastern border, at [[Brentwood Town Centre]] in the centre-west and, most notably, at [[Metrotown, Burnaby|Metrotown]] in the south.\n\nMajor north\u2013south streets crossing the City include Boundary Road, Willingdon Avenue, Royal Oak Avenue, Kensington Avenue, Sperling Avenue, Gaglardi Way, Cariboo Road, and North Road. East\u2013west routes linking Burnaby's neighbouring cities to each other include [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|Hastings Street]], [[British Columbia Highway 7A|Barnet Highway]], the [[British Columbia Highway 7|Lougheed Highway]], [[Kingsway (Vancouver)|Kingsway]] (which follows the old horse trail between Vancouver and New Westminster), Canada Way and Marine Drive/Marine Way. Douglas Road, which used to cross the city from northwest to southeast, has largely been absorbed by the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] and Canada Way. Since the 1990s, Burnaby has developed a network of cycling trails. It is also well served by [[List of bus routes in Metro Vancouver|Metro Vancouver's bus system]], run by the [[Coast Mountain Bus Company]], a division of [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n| title = Population history\n| type  = Canada\n| align = right\n| width       = \n| state       = \n| shading     = \n| percentages = \n| footnote    = ''Source: [[Statistics Canada]]''<br /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/statistics/people-population-community/census|title=Census of Canada - Province of British Columbia|first=Ministry of Citizens|last=Services|website=www2.gov.bc.ca}}</ref>\n|1921|12883\n|1931|25564\n|1941|30328\n|1951|58376\n|1956|83745\n|1961|100157\n|1966|112036\n|1971|125660\n|1976|131599\n|1981|136494\n|1986|145161\n|1991|158858\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|179209\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|193954\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|202799\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|223218\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|232755\n}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Burnaby (2011)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5915025&Data=Count&SearchText=burnaby&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=Religion&B1=All&Custom=&amp;TABID=1 |title=Burnaby Religions, 2011 Census |publisher=Statistics Canada |date=September 11, 2013 |access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref>\n|label1 = [[Christianity]]\n|value1 = 42.9\n|color1 = Blue\n|label2 = [[Buddhism]]\n|value2 = 4.8\n|color2 = Orange\n|label3 = [[Islam]]\n|value3 = 4.5\n|color3 = Green\n|label4 = [[Sikhism]]\n|value4 = 2.9\n|color4 = Yellow\n|label5 = [[Hinduism]]\n|value5 = 2.2\n|color5 = Red\n|label6 = Other or not religious\n|value6 = 42.7\n|color6 = Black\n}}\nAccording to the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]], [[Statistics Canada]] reported that Burnaby had a population of 232,755 who resided in 92,201 of its 98,030 total dwellings, a 4.3 percent change from the 2011 census.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5915025&Geo2=CD&Code2=5915&Data=Count&SearchText=burnaby&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1| title=Census Profile, 2016 Census Burnaby, City [Census subdivision]| publisher=Statistics Canada| access-date=April 15, 2019}}</ref> With a land area of {{convert|90.61|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, it had a population density of {{Pop density|2568.7|90.61|km2|sqmi|prec=1}} in 2016.

It is the third most populated urban centre in British Columbia (after Vancouver and Surrey) with an estimated population of 249,197 (2017).\n\nSimilar to Greater Vancouver, Burnaby has always had diverse ethnic and immigrant communities. For example, North Burnaby near Hastings Street has long been home to many [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] restaurants and recreational [[bocce]] games. [[Metrotown, Burnaby|Metrotown]]'s high-rise condominium towers in the south have been fuelled in part by recent arrivals from China ([[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]), Taiwan, and South Korea. According to the 2006 Census, 54% of Burnaby residents have a mother tongue that is neither English nor French.\n\nPolitically, Burnaby has maintained a left-wing city council closely affiliated with the provincial [[British Columbia New Democratic Party|NDP]] and school board for many years, while sometimes electing more conservative legislators provincially (for the [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit]] and [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal]] parties) and federally (for the [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform]], [[Canadian Alliance|Alliance]], and [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] parties). Its longest-serving politician had been [[Svend Robinson]] of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP), Canada's first openly [[gay]] member of Parliament, but after 25 years and seven elections he resigned his post in early 2004 after stealing and then returning an expensive ring. Burnaby voters endorsed his assistant, [[Bill Siksay]], as his replacement in the spring 2004 Canadian federal election. In the [[2013 British Columbia general election|May 2013 provincial election]], residents of the city sent 3 NDP MLAs and one Liberal MLA to the British Columbia legislature. The NDP MLA for [[Burnaby-Lougheed]], [[Jane Shin]], faced controversy after the election for misrepresenting herself as a physician while not having completed a medical residency nor holding a licence to practise medicine.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moreau|first1=Jennifer|title = Newsmaker of the year: Jane Shin|url=http://www.burnabynow.com/news/newsmaker-of-the-year-jane-shin-1.771814|website=Burnaby Now|publisher=Glacier Media|accessdate=February 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2009 survey by ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine, Burnaby is Canada's best run city.

He was known after his hometown, [[Le\u017cajsk]] ({{lang-yi|\u05dc\u05d9\u05d6\u05e9\u05e2\u05e0\u05e1\u05e7|translit=Lizhensk}}) near [[Rzesz\u00f3w]] in [[Poland]]. He was part of the inner \"Chevraya Kadisha\" (Holy Society) school of the [[Maggid]] Rebbe [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch]] (second leader of the Hasidic movement), who became the decentralised, third generation leadership after the passing of Rebbe Dov Ber in 1772. Their dissemination to new areas of [[Eastern Europe]] led the movement's rapid revivalist expansion.\n\nRebbi Elimelech authored the classic [[Hasidic philosophy|work]] ''Noam Elimelech''. It developed the Hasidic theory of the [[Tzaddik]] into the full doctrine of \"''Practical/Popular Tzaddikism''\". This shaped the social role of [[Ayin and Yesh|mystical]] [[Rebbe|leadership]], characteristic of the \"''Mainstream Hasidic''\" path. He was the founder of Hasidism in [[Poland]]-[[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], and numerous leaders and [[Hasidic dynasties|dynasties]] emerged from his disciples in the early 19th century, including the [[Chozeh of Lublin]], the [[Maggid of Koznitz]] and [[Menachem Mendel of Rimanov]], one of the three \"Fathers of Polish Hasidism\". Because of this, Rebbi Elimelech is venerated by the \"Mainstream\" path in Hasidism, predominant especially in Poland, who descend from his influence.\n\n==Biography==\nRebbe Elimelech was born in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (Central Europe), which was located in the Kingdom of Poland that was part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. He died in [[Le\u017cajsk]] on the 21st of [[Adar]]. He was known as a [[Tzadik]] who devoted his life to studying and teaching the [[Torah]], as well as encouraging people to draw closer in return to God.\n\n===The brothers Rabbi Elimelech and Reb Zushya===\nRebbe Elimelech was a prominent student of the [[Dovber of Mezeritch|Maggid of Mezeritch]], and was brought under his tutelage by his brother the famous Rebbe Reb [[Meshulam Zushya of Anipoli]]. Both brothers are central figures in Hasidic tradition and Reb Zushya is especially beloved for his sincerity and fervour. The two offered a contrast in the model of the Hasidic [[Rebbe]], with Elimelech the ascetic scholar, and Zushya giving the impression of the charismatic \"saintly simpleton\", although he too was well versed in [[Hasidic philosophy]]. Of all the students in the Maggid's \"Holy Society\" it is told that only Zushya could contain his [[dveikus]] (fervour) and remain in the room as the Maggid revealed fiery new teachings. The other students would faint or run out of the room in ecstasy.<ref>Cited in ''The Great Maggid'' by [[Jacob Immanuel Schochet]]. Kehot Publications</ref> The two brothers would travel together in mystical exile of [[Teshuvah|repentance]] to atone on behalf of the whole Jewish people and the exile of the [[Shechinah]] (Divine Presence). Famous Hasidic tales are told of their encounters.\n<blockquote>\nOn one occasion, Rabbi Elimelech and Reb Zushya were staying at an inn. Each night, gentile peasants would enter their room and jestingly beat the one who lay nearest the fireside, Reb Zushya. One night, Rabbi Elimelech offered to change places with his brother so that he could take the beatings instead. Suggesting that Reb Zushya had suffered enough of this \"Divine admonishment\", the agreement was made and Rabbi Elimelech lay next to the fire instead. That night, the common gentiles again entered to begin their jest. This time, however, one of them said that the one by the fire had taken his fair share of the treatment, and now it would be better to jest with the other one! Again Reb Zushya took the beatings. Afterwards, he told his brother that whatever is decided in Heaven transpires!\n</blockquote>\n\n===Hasidic Leadership===\nAfter the death of the [[Dovber of Mezeritch|Maggid of Mezeritch]], the Hasidic movement avoided one centralised leader, as had characterised it under the [[Baal Shem Tov]] and the Maggid. Instead the great leadership of students of the Maggid dispersed across Eastern Europe, from Poland to Russia, taking with them their different interpretations of Hasidism. Nonetheless, in this third generation, Rabbi Elimelech was considered by most of the Maggid's students and followers as his successor. He began the dissemination of Hasidism in Poland, which subsequently increased to a much greater extent under his foremost disciple, the [[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin|Chozeh of Lublin]].\n\nMany of Rebbe Elimelech's students (talmidim) went on to be Rebbes in their own right. The most famous are the [[Chozeh of Lublin]], Rebbe [[Menachem Mendel of Rimanov]], the [[Kozhnitzer Maggid]], the [[Apter Rov]] and Rabbi [[Kalonymus Kalman Epstein|Kalonymus Kalman Halevi Epstein]], author of ''Maor Vashemesh''. \n\nTo this day his grave in [[Le\u017cajsk]], [[Poland]], is visited by thousands of those faithful to Hasidism, particularly on the anniversary of his death, the 21st of the Hebrew month of [[Adar]] (in leap years, commemorated twice, in Adar I and Adar II).<ref> David M.

This book is one of the principal works of [[Hasidism]]. The sefer was called ''Sefer Shel Tzadikim'', (a Book for the Righteous) by Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] (founder of the [[Lubavitch]] dynasty).\n\nThe book has asterisks or stars placed in seemingly random places over words.  Tradition has it that these stars have some meaning. In ''Devarim Areivim'' (another [[Hasidic]] classic), the author, Rabbi Dov Ehrmann, wrote: \"In the first edition of the sefer, there are in many places small stars which allude to some secret meaning\". The [[Klausenberg (Hasidic dynasty)|Klausenberger]] [[Rebbe]] once said that the stars in the heavens are a commentary to the stars in the book ''Noam Elimelech''. As such, all subsequent printings have included these stars.\n\nRabbi Elimelech also wrote ''Tzetl Koton'', a seventeen-point program on how to be a good Jew, and ''Hanhagos HaAdam'', a list of [[Minhag|customs]] for all pious Jews to follow.\n\n===Three Hasidic mystical paths===\n[[Image:Lizhenskgrave.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Biala (Hasidic dynasty)|Biala]] Rebbe of America praying in the [[Ohel (grave)|Ohel]] of Rabbi Elimelech. His grave is venerated in pilgrimage by \"Mainstream\"-Polish [[Hasidic dynasties|dynasties]] and their followers, as their spiritual path in Hasidism descends from his influence]]\nA Hasidic aphorism<ref>In ''Transforming Darkness into Light: Kabbalah and Psychology'' (Teachings of Kabbalah Series), [[Yitzchak Ginsburgh]], Gal Einai Pub.</ref> describes three paths of mysticism in the Hasidic movement, formed by three works of Hasidic thought. [[Nachman of Breslov]]'s ''Likkutei Moharan'' is described as the Hasidic book of the great, giving hope and encouragement to those trapped in problems, through Rabbi Nachman's innovative creativity and the personal [[Hitbodedut|articulation]] of one's problems to God. [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]]'s ''[[Tanya]]'' is subtitled the Hasidic book for the intermediate person, who has ease to intellectually [[Hisbonenus|contemplate]] and internalise [[Hasidic thought]], free from distracting troubles. In this [[Habad]] path, the Tzadik's primary role is to teach the esoteric dimension of Hasidism in intellectual understanding. ''Noam Elimelech'' is seen as the formative book of the righteous [[Tzadik]]. It instructs select people of spiritual ability how to become Hasidic mystical leaders, while advocating attachment to the Tzadik by the common folk. Because of this, ''Noam Elimelech'' influenced the Mainstream Hasidic proliferation of the Tzadik, who embodies and channels the [[Ayin and Yesh|Ayin-Yesh]] Divine flow of blessing to this world.

He was part of the inner \"Chevraya Kadisha\" (Holy Society) school of the [[Maggid]] Rebbe [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch]] (second leader of the Hasidic movement), who became the decentralised, third generation leadership after the passing of Rebbe Dov Ber in 1772. Their dissemination to new areas of [[Eastern Europe]] led the movement's rapid revivalist expansion.\n\nRebbi Elimelech authored the classic [[Hasidic philosophy|work]] ''Noam Elimelech''. It developed the Hasidic theory of the [[Tzaddik]] into the full doctrine of \"''Practical/Popular Tzaddikism''\". This shaped the social role of [[Ayin and Yesh|mystical]] [[Rebbe|leadership]], characteristic of the \"''Mainstream Hasidic''\" path. He was the founder of Hasidism in [[Poland]]-[[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], and numerous leaders and [[Hasidic dynasties|dynasties]] emerged from his disciples in the early 19th century, including the [[Chozeh of Lublin]], the [[Maggid of Koznitz]] and [[Menachem Mendel of Rimanov]], one of the three \"Fathers of Polish Hasidism\". Because of this, Rebbi Elimelech is venerated by the \"Mainstream\" path in Hasidism, predominant especially in Poland, who descend from his influence.\n\n==Biography==\nRebbe Elimelech was born in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (Central Europe), which was located in the Kingdom of Poland that was part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. He died in [[Le\u017cajsk]] on the 21st of [[Adar]]. He was known as a [[Tzadik]] who devoted his life to studying and teaching the [[Torah]], as well as encouraging people to draw closer in return to God.\n\n===The brothers Rabbi Elimelech and Reb Zushya===\nRebbe Elimelech was a prominent student of the [[Dovber of Mezeritch|Maggid of Mezeritch]], and was brought under his tutelage by his brother the famous Rebbe Reb [[Meshulam Zushya of Anipoli]]. Both brothers are central figures in Hasidic tradition and Reb Zushya is especially beloved for his sincerity and fervour. The two offered a contrast in the model of the Hasidic [[Rebbe]], with Elimelech the ascetic scholar, and Zushya giving the impression of the charismatic \"saintly simpleton\", although he too was well versed in [[Hasidic philosophy]]. Of all the students in the Maggid's \"Holy Society\" it is told that only Zushya could contain his [[dveikus]] (fervour) and remain in the room as the Maggid revealed fiery new teachings. The other students would faint or run out of the room in ecstasy.<ref>Cited in ''The Great Maggid'' by [[Jacob Immanuel Schochet]]. Kehot Publications</ref> The two brothers would travel together in mystical exile of [[Teshuvah|repentance]] to atone on behalf of the whole Jewish people and the exile of the [[Shechinah]] (Divine Presence). Famous Hasidic tales are told of their encounters.\n<blockquote>\nOn one occasion, Rabbi Elimelech and Reb Zushya were staying at an inn. Each night, gentile peasants would enter their room and jestingly beat the one who lay nearest the fireside, Reb Zushya. One night, Rabbi Elimelech offered to change places with his brother so that he could take the beatings instead. Suggesting that Reb Zushya had suffered enough of this \"Divine admonishment\", the agreement was made and Rabbi Elimelech lay next to the fire instead. That night, the common gentiles again entered to begin their jest. This time, however, one of them said that the one by the fire had taken his fair share of the treatment, and now it would be better to jest with the other one! Again Reb Zushya took the beatings. Afterwards, he told his brother that whatever is decided in Heaven transpires!\n</blockquote>\n\n===Hasidic Leadership===\nAfter the death of the [[Dovber of Mezeritch|Maggid of Mezeritch]], the Hasidic movement avoided one centralised leader, as had characterised it under the [[Baal Shem Tov]] and the Maggid. Instead the great leadership of students of the Maggid dispersed across Eastern Europe, from Poland to Russia, taking with them their different interpretations of Hasidism. Nonetheless, in this third generation, Rabbi Elimelech was considered by most of the Maggid's students and followers as his successor. He began the dissemination of Hasidism in Poland, which subsequently increased to a much greater extent under his foremost disciple, the [[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin|Chozeh of Lublin]].\n\nMany of Rebbe Elimelech's students (talmidim) went on to be Rebbes in their own right. The most famous are the [[Chozeh of Lublin]], Rebbe [[Menachem Mendel of Rimanov]], the [[Kozhnitzer Maggid]], the [[Apter Rov]] and Rabbi [[Kalonymus Kalman Epstein|Kalonymus Kalman Halevi Epstein]], author of ''Maor Vashemesh''. \n\nTo this day his grave in [[Le\u017cajsk]], [[Poland]], is visited by thousands of those faithful to Hasidism, particularly on the anniversary of his death, the 21st of the Hebrew month of [[Adar]] (in leap years, commemorated twice, in Adar I and Adar II).<ref> David M. Gitlitz & Linda Kay Davidson \u2018\u2019Pilgrimage and the Jews\u2019\u2019 (Westport: CT: Praeger, 2006), 112-115.</ref> In 2012, approximately 6,000 pilgrims <ref>http://www.rp.pl/artykul/10,838345-Chasydzi-pielgrzymuja-do-grobu-cadyka.html</ref> came to visit the site on the anniversary coming from Israel, Ukraine, Hungary, Germany, Holland, France, Great Britain, Canada and the USA.<ref>http://www.nowiny24.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120315/LEZAJSK/120319740</ref> In most Chasidic [[minyan]]im, [[Tachanun]] is omitted on the Noam Elimelech's [[Bereavement in Judaism#Annual remembrances|Yartzeit]].<ref>See {{cite web |url=http://woodstocktom.com/2009/12/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-tachanun/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718081857/http://woodstocktom.com/2009/12/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-tachanun/ |archivedate=2011-07-18 }}</ref>\n\nIt is said that when Rebbe Elimelech came before the heavenly tribunal, he stated that \"unfortunately, I didn't pray or learn Torah\", the judge then proclaimed \"if so then you have to be taken to hell!\", the angels carried Rebbe Elimelech to what he thought was [[Hell]] but was really [[Heaven]], Rebbe Elimelech then said \"How merciful is our [[Father in heaven]], He made hell so good, just imagine what heaven must be like!\"\n\n==Noam Elimelech==\nAs is common amongst great Rabbis, he is most commonly known by the name of his popular book ''Noam Elimelech'', a commentary on the Torah. This book is one of the principal works of [[Hasidism]]. The sefer was called ''Sefer Shel Tzadikim'', (a Book for the Righteous) by Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] (founder of the [[Lubavitch]] dynasty).\n\nThe book has asterisks or stars placed in seemingly random places over words.  Tradition has it that these stars have some meaning. In ''Devarim Areivim'' (another [[Hasidic]] classic), the author, Rabbi Dov Ehrmann, wrote: \"In the first edition of the sefer, there are in many places small stars which allude to some secret meaning\". The [[Klausenberg (Hasidic dynasty)|Klausenberger]] [[Rebbe]] once said that the stars in the heavens are a commentary to the stars in the book ''Noam Elimelech''. As such, all subsequent printings have included these stars.\n\nRabbi Elimelech also wrote ''Tzetl Koton'', a seventeen-point program on how to be a good Jew, and ''Hanhagos HaAdam'', a list of [[Minhag|customs]] for all pious Jews to follow.\n\n===Three Hasidic mystical paths===\n[[Image:Lizhenskgrave.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Biala (Hasidic dynasty)|Biala]] Rebbe of America praying in the [[Ohel (grave)|Ohel]] of Rabbi Elimelech. His grave is venerated in pilgrimage by \"Mainstream\"-Polish [[Hasidic dynasties|dynasties]] and their followers, as their spiritual path in Hasidism descends from his influence]]\nA Hasidic aphorism<ref>In ''Transforming Darkness into Light: Kabbalah and Psychology'' (Teachings of Kabbalah Series), [[Yitzchak Ginsburgh]], Gal Einai Pub.</ref> describes three paths of mysticism in the Hasidic movement, formed by three works of Hasidic thought. [[Nachman of Breslov]]'s ''Likkutei Moharan'' is described as the Hasidic book of the great, giving hope and encouragement to those trapped in problems, through Rabbi Nachman's innovative creativity and the personal [[Hitbodedut|articulation]] of one's problems to God. [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]]'s ''[[Tanya]]'' is subtitled the Hasidic book for the intermediate person, who has ease to intellectually [[Hisbonenus|contemplate]] and internalise [[Hasidic thought]], free from distracting troubles. In this [[Habad]] path, the Tzadik's primary role is to teach the esoteric dimension of Hasidism in intellectual understanding. ''Noam Elimelech'' is seen as the formative book of the righteous [[Tzadik]]. It instructs select people of spiritual ability how to become Hasidic mystical leaders, while advocating attachment to the Tzadik by the common folk. Because of this, ''Noam Elimelech'' influenced the Mainstream Hasidic proliferation of the Tzadik, who embodies and channels the [[Ayin and Yesh|Ayin-Yesh]] Divine flow of blessing to this world. The [[Chozeh of Lublin]] (1745-1815) developed further the dynamics of this process. Meanwhile, the mid-19th century [[Simcha Bunim of Peshischa|Peshischa]]-[[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk|Kotzk]] spiritual development in Hasidism and its influence, is excluded from this description. It left aside ''Tzaddikism'' and mystical focus in favour of personal autonomy, introspection and Rabbinic [[Torah study]] in the spirit of Hasidic spiritual inwardness. The ''Yid HaKodosh'' of [[Przysucha]] in Poland began this trend when he broke away from the Chozeh of Lublin's Tzadik focused spiritual path.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://lizensk.com ''Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk'' ]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080612150258/http://www.jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/books/html/bk1194026.htm ''Digitized 1st Edition Hebrew Noam Elimelech'']\n* [https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%9D_%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%9A ''Noam Elimelech text on Hebrew Wikisource'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080514125433/http://www.targum.com/files/zweckersampler.pdf ''Noam Elimelech in English samples'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080511213206/http://www.targum.com/files/zweckerprayer.pdf ''Tefilah Kodem HaTefillah'']\n* [http://770live.com/En770/nigunim/nigunPlay.asp?nigunId=Dovid_Hurwitz/212.rm&gif=212 A Hassidic Tune attributed to Rabbi Elimelech of Lizensk]\n* [http://www.chassidusonline.com/noam-elimelech-article-mishpacha.pdf ''Rebbe Elimelech Stories'']\n* [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/3933 ''Ohel Elimelech Hebrew Tales about Rebbe Elimelech'']\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-rel|jw}}\n{{Succession box| before= [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch|Magid of Mezritsh]] | title=Hasidic Rebbes| years=1772\u20131786 | after=[[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin|Chozeh of Lublin]], Rabbi [[Yisroel Hopsztajn|Yisroel of Kozhnitz]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elimelech Of Lezhinsk}}\n[[Category:1717 births]]\n[[Category:1787 deaths]]\n[[Category:18th-century rabbis]]\n[[Category:Hasidic rebbes]]\n[[Category:Hasidic rabbis in Europe]]\n[[Category:Jews from Galicia (Eastern Europe)]]\n[[Category:Polish Orthodox rabbis]]\n", "name_user": "TRM001", "label": "safe", "comment": "grammar/sentence fluency", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimelech_of_Lizhensk"}

On occasion, these malignant cells have the appearance of [[Reed-Sternberg cell]]s. The lesions should show no or very little extension outside of blood vessels.

Microscopic examination of these tissues typically shows medium-sized to large-sized lymphocytes located within small- to medium-sized blood vessels of the skin, lung, and other tissues or the sinusoids of the [[Liver sinusoid|liver]], [[bone marrow#Stroma|bone marrow]],  and [[spleen]]. On occasion, these malignant cells have the appearance of [[Reed-Sternberg cell]]s. The lesions should show no or very little extension outside of blood vessels. As determined by [[immunohistochemistry]] analyses, the intravascular malignant lymphocytes express typical B-cell proteins, particularly [[CD20]], which is found in almost all cases, [[CD79a]] and [[PAX5|Pax5]], which are  found in most cases,<ref name=\"pmid30111607\"/> and [[MUM1]] and [[Bcl-2]], which are found in 95% and 91% of cases, respectively.<ref name=\"pmid27271843\"/> These B-cells are usually (80% of cases) non-germinal center B-cells (see Pathophysiology section) and may express one or more of the gene, chromosome, and gene expression abnormalities described in the above Pathophysiology section. Since the classical variant can present with a wide range of clinical signs, symptoms, and organ involvements, its presence may not be apparent, particularly in cases that do not exhibit clinically apparent skin lesions.

In the absence of long- or short-term, controlled [[clinical trial]]s on treating this lymphoma, individuals with IVBCL have been treated with the standard regimen used to treat [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]]s viz., the [[CHOP]] chemotherapy regimen which consists of [[cyclophosphamide]], [[hydroxydaunorubicin]] (also termed doxorubicin or adriamycin), [[oncovin]] (also teremed vincristine), and a [[corticosteroid]] (i.e. either [[prednisone]] or [[prednisolone]]) plus the [[monoclonal antibody]] immunotherapy agent, Rituximab. This immunochemotherapeutic regimen has achieved an [[Survival rate#Overall survival|overall survival rate]] at 3 years of 81%; this overall survival rate using CHOP before Retuximab was added to the regimen was only 33%. However, highly toxic reactions to Rituximab such as pulmonary failure may occur and require delay or interrupting the use of this drug.

In conservative Japanese culture, becoming a salaryman is the expected career choice for young men and those who do not take this career path are regarded as living with a stigma and less prestige. On the other hand, the word ''salaryman'' is sometimes used with derogatory connotation for his total dependence on his employer and lack of individuality.\n\n==History==\nThe word ''[[wikt:\u30b5\u30e9\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30f3|sarar\u012bman]]'' is often described as ''[[wasei-eigo]]'', a Japanese formation from English [[loanword]]s, but it appears to instead be a straight borrowing from the English phrase \"salaried man\", which predates the Japanese term by nearly a century.

Workers in the [[mizu sh\u014dbai]] (nightlife) and entertainment industries (including actors and singers) are not included even though their income may be salary based. Similarly, doctors, engineers, lawyers, accountants, musicians, artists, politicians, [[freelancer]]s and corporate executives are also excluded.<ref name=\"vogel\"/>\n\nA typical description of the salaryman is a male white-collar employee who typically earns his salary \"based on individual abilities rather than on seniority.\"<ref name=\"wingate\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.fairfield.edu/fjgc/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wingate-Japanese-Salarymen-On-the-Way-to-Extinction.pdf|format=PDF|title=Japanese Salarymen: On the Way to Extinction?|last=Wingate|first=Kristin|publisher=Undergraduate Journal of Global Citizenship 1.1|date=2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416115022/http://blog.fairfield.edu/fjgc/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wingate-Japanese-Salarymen-On-the-Way-to-Extinction.pdf|archive-date=2015-04-16|df=}}</ref> Salarymen are known for working many hours, sometimes over eighty hours per week. Oftentimes, because of his busy work schedule, the salaryman does not have time to raise a family and his work becomes a lifelong commitment. Companies typically hire the salarymen straight after high school, and they are expected to stay with the company until retirement, around the time they reach the age between 55 and 60. As a reward for the demonstration of their loyalty, companies rarely fire the salarymen unless it is under special \"dire\" circumstances.<ref name=\"wingate\"/> There is also a belief that the \"amount of time spent at the workplace correlates to the perceived efficiency of the employee.\" As a result of this intense work-driven lifestyle, salarymen may be more likely to suffer from mental or physical health problems, including heart failure or suicide.<ref name=\"wingate\"/>\n\n== Social image ==\n[[File:Hitokara at Karaoke-Box.jpg|thumb|upright|Hitokara at Karaoke-Box]]\n[[File:Japanese Mahjong Tiles 1.jpg|thumb|Mahjong tiles]]\nThe prevalence of salarymen in Japanese society has given birth to many depictions by both the Japanese and American media. Some films in Japan about salarymen include ''Mr. Salaryman'', ''Japanese Salaryman NEO'' (based on the TV series), and a drama series entitled ''History of a Salaryman''. There is a certain expectation among the middle and upper classes for Japanese men to become salarymen. For many young Japanese men, accepting anything less than becoming a salaryman and conforming to its ideal is considered a failure, not only of him, but of his parents.<ref name=\"mclelland\">McLelland, Mark. \"Salarymen Doing Queer: Gay Men and the Heterosexual Public Sphere.\" Genders, Transgenders, and Sexualities in Japan. N.p.: Routledge, 2005. 96-110. Print.</ref>\n\nThe life of a salaryman revolves around work. The activities that he does outside of work typically involve his coworkers, which lessens the distance between him and work. Due to this expectation, there have been a variety of derogatory names given to salarymen: {{nihongo|''shachiku''|\u793e\u755c}} meaning corporate livestock, {{nihongo|''kaisha no inu''|\u4f1a\u793e\u306e\u72ac}} dog of the company, and {{nihongo|''kigyou senshi''|\u4f01\u696d\u6226\u58eb}} corporate soldier, to ridicule salarymen.\n\n===Entertainment===\nChanging social circumstances have greatly diversified the life of the salaryman outside of work. Though the importance of social drinking has not declined, its image has changed over time from mass partying during the economic bubble to conservative consumption at home after the collapse of the economy during the 1990s. [[Mahjong]] was an immensely popular game among the 1960s generation of salarymen, who brought the game into company circles directly from high school and college groups. The 1970s generation saw a gradual decrease in the number of avid mahjong players, and by the 1980s, it became common to not show any interest at all.\n\n[[Golf]] became widely popular during the economic bubble, when golf club passes became useful tools for currying favor with corporate executives. Many mid-level salarymen were pressured into taking up golf to participate in golfing events with their superiors. The collapse of the economic bubble led to the closing of many golf courses, and the ritual of playing [[golf]] with executives has become increasingly rare. However, some current salarymen may have golfing experience from their student days, and [[golf]] is still acknowledged as an expensive hobby for salarymen.<ref>Dasgupta, Romit. \"Creating Corporate Warriors: The \"Salaryman\" and Masculinity in Japan.\" Asian Masculinities: The Meaning and Practice of Manhood in China and Japan.
