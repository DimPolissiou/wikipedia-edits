As it does not have any stipulated goals, it is irrelevant to talk about winning or losing in relation to ''Second Life''. Likewise, unlike a traditional talker{{Vague|date=May 2015}}, ''Second Life'' contains an extensive world that can be explored and interacted with, and it can be used purely as a creative tool set if the user so chooses.

A Premium membership (US$11.99 monthly, US$32.97 quarterly, or US$99 annually) extends access to an increased level of technical support, and also pays an automatic stipend of L$300/week into the member's avatar account, and after 45 days that resident will receive a L$700 bonus, making it L$1,000 for that week.  This amount has decreased since the original stipend of L$500, which is still paid to older accounts.  Certain accounts created during an earlier period may receive L$400. This stipend, if changed into USD, means that the actual cost for the benefit of extended tech support for an annual payment of US$72 is only about US$14, depending on the currency exchange rates. However, the vast majority of casual users of ''Second Life'' do not upgrade beyond the free \"basic\" account.\n\nAvatars may take any form users choose (human, animal, vegetable, mineral, or a combination thereof) or residents may choose to resemble themselves as they are in real life.<ref>{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.weburbanist.com/2007/06/17/top-3-look-alike-avatars-and-people-from-second-life-to-real-life/\n|title=Second Life Avatars and their Real Life |publisher=Web Urbanist\n|accessdate = June 18, 2007\n|date=2007-06-17 }}</ref> They may choose even more abstract forms, given that almost every aspect of an avatar is fully customizable. [[Second Life Culture|''Second Life'' Culture]] consists of many activities and behaviors that are also present in real life. A single resident account may have only one avatar at a time, although the appearance of this avatar can change between as many different forms as the Resident wishes. Avatar forms, like almost everything else in Second Life, can be either created by the user, or bought pre-made. A single person may also have multiple accounts, and thus appear to be multiple Residents (a person's multiple accounts are referred to as ''[[Alternate character|alts]]'').\n\nAvatars can travel via walking, running, vehicular access, flying, or teleportation. Because ''Second Life'' is such a vast virtual world, teleportation is used when avatars wish to travel instantly and efficiently. Once they reach their destination, they may travel in more conventional means at various speeds.\n\nAvatars can communicate via local chat, group chat, global instant messaging (known as IM), and voice (public, private and group). Chatting is used for localized public conversations between two or more avatars, and is visible to any avatar within a given distance. IMs are used for private conversations, either between two avatars, or among the members of a group, or even between objects and avatars. Unlike chatting, IM communication does not depend on the participants being within a certain distance of each other.

Issues range from the technical ([[Real estate (Second Life)#Budgeting of server resources|budgeting of server resources]]), to moral ([[Second Life issues and criticisms#Pornography|pornography]]), to legal ([[Economy of Second Life#Legal position of the Linden Dollar|legal position of the Linden Dollar]], ''[[Bragg v. Linden Lab]]''). Security issues have also been a concern.\n\n=== Regulation ===\nIn the past, large portions of the ''Second Life'' economy consisted of businesses that are regulated or banned. Changes to ''Second Life''{{'}}s Terms of Service in this regard have largely had the purpose of bringing activity within ''Second Life'' into compliance with various international laws, even though the person running the business may be in full compliance with the law in their own country.\n\nOn July 26, 2007, Linden Lab announced a ban on in-world gambling due to federal and state regulations on Internet gambling that could affect Linden Lab if it was permitted to continue. The ban was immediately met with in-world protests.<ref name=\"libsl-sl-gambling-banned\">{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201201441|\ntitle=Gambling Banned in Second Life|\naccessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2007, a $750,000 in-world Linden Dollar bank or [[Ponzi scheme]] called [[Ginko Financial]] collapsed due to a [[bank run]] triggered by Linden Lab's ban on gambling.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ginko Financial's End-Game |url=http://alphavilleherald.com/2007/08/ginko-financial-2.html |website=The Alpha Herald |accessdate=28 November 2019 |date=6 August 2007}}</ref> The aftershocks of this collapse caused severe liquidity problems for other virtual \"Linden Dollar banks\", which critics had long asserted were scams.

These include increased system latency, and intermittent client crashes. However, some faults are caused by the system's use of an \"asset server\" cluster, on which the actual data governing objects is stored separately from the areas of the world and the avatars that use those objects. The communication between the main servers and the asset cluster appears to constitute a [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] which frequently causes problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massively.com/2008/01/06/second-life-grid-closed-due-to-asset-problems/ |title=Second Life grid closed due to asset problems \u2013 Massively |publisher=Massively.com |author=Tateru Nino |date= January 6, 2008 <!-- at 10:30 am --> |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/features/blog/2008/03/28/resolved-asset-server-issues |title=RESOLVED&#93; Asset Server Issues \u00ab Official Second Life Blog |publisher=Blog.secondlife.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondlifeinsider.com/2007/06/12/asset-server-issues/ |title=Asset server issues \u2013 Second Life Insider |publisher=Secondlifeinsider.com |author=Eloise PasteurFiled under: LSL, Gridbugs |date= June 12, 2007 |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref> Typically, when asset server downtime is announced, users are advised not to build, manipulate objects, or engage in business, leaving them with little to do but chat and generally reducing confidence in all businesses on the grid.\n\nAnother problem is inventory loss,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/UPDATED-Experiencing-inventory-loss-Read-on/ba-p/573214 |title=UPDATED&#93; Experiencing inventory loss?

Linden Lab offers no compensation for items that are lost in this way, although a policy change instituted in 2008 allows accounts to file support tickets when inventory loss occurs. Many in-world businesses will attempt to compensate for this or restore items, although they are under no obligation to do so and not all are able to do so. A recent change in how the company handles items which have \"lost their parent directory\" means that inventory loss is much less of a problem and resolves faster than in recent years. \"Loss to recovery times\" have gone from months (or never) to hours or a day or two for the majority of users, but inventory loss does still exist.\n\n''Second Life'' functions by streaming all data to the user live over the Internet with minimal local caching of frequently used data. The user is expected to have a minimum of 300kbit/s of Internet bandwidth for basic functionality. Due to the proprietary communications protocols, it is not possible to use a network proxy service to reduce network load when many people are all using the same location, such as when used for group activities in a school or business.\n\n=== Quality assurance ===\nCriticism of [[Software Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] of [[Second Life]] states that [[Linden Lab]] focuses too much on bringing new features to the production environment instead of fixing long-standing bugs that, in the worst case, cause financial loss for the users. On April 30, 2007, an open letter signed by over 3,000<ref name=\"secondlife-openletter-signers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.projectopenletter.com/News.aspx|title=Open Letters News, 5/1/2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503011341/http://www.projectopenletter.com/News.aspx|archivedate=May 3, 2007|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> users was sent to Linden Lab to protest the [[Software Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] process of the company.<ref name=\"secondlife-openletter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.projectopenletter.com/|title=Project Open Letter|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602235847/http://projectopenletter.com/|archive-date=2007-06-02|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref> Linden Lab has responded to the open letter.<ref name=\"secondlife-openletter-response\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/04/30/project-open-letter/|title=Response to the Open Letter|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506125440/http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/04/30/project-open-letter/|archivedate=May 6, 2007|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Frame rate ===\nComputer hardware and Internet connections capable of smoothly rendering high quality content in other [[MMOG]]s may perform poorly in ''Second Life'', resulting in low [[frame rate]]s and unresponsive controls on even minimal graphical configurations. The problem is especially prevalent when large numbers of avatars congregate in one area. The problem is largely due to the fact that the world is entirely user created, and the majority of content created by users is made without any sort of basic graphical optimization. As a result, objects with both unnecessarily high polygon counts, and unnecessarily high resolution textures are prevalent. It is not uncommon for users to have to download and use, upwards of dozens of times, the amount of resources than would actually be required for the equivalent visual result. Certain areas have guidelines for script usage, which helps reduce lag by reducing resources used server-side, but does nothing to alleviate the primary issue above.\n\n=== Congestion ===\nA single region (65536&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of land hosted on a single [[CPU]]) is set to accommodate a limited number of Residents (40 on 'mainland' regions, up to 100 on private islands),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.secondlife.com/ics/support/KBAnswer.asp?questionID=4010|accessdate=June 24, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> causing some popular locations such as teleportation points to become inaccessible at times. It is possible for an area of land a Resident has paid for to become inaccessible because another area in the same region has exhausted the avatar limit.\n\n=== Interface ===\nThe control scheme for ''Second Life'' combines controls useful for 3D editing with those useful for game play, which can be highly unintuitive for many. This requires various combinations of [[Alt key|alt]], [[Control key|ctrl]], and the mouse for basic manipulation of the camera and in-world objects. Also, everything in the player's possession\u2014textures, animations, objects, clothing, sounds, videos\u2014shares a common directory tree, and can quickly become cluttered if not carefully managed.\n\n=== Alternative accounts ===\nThe ability for a single real individual to create an unlimited number of accounts for free could have the effect of highly exaggerating the \"residence\" figures. Blogs and forum posts regularly allege exaggerated membership and performance claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/I-ll-See-Your-Million-and-Raise-You-a-Million/ba-p/544153|title=I'll See Your Million\u2026 and Raise You a Million \u00ab Official Second Life Blog|publisher=Blog.secondlife.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203013528/http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/I-ll-See-Your-Million-and-Raise-You-a-Million/ba-p/544153|archive-date=2014-02-03|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/12/26/lindens_second_life_numbers_and_the_presss_desire_to_believe.php|title=Linden's Second Life numbers and the press's desire to believe|publisher=Corante|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101072536/http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/12/26/lindens_second_life_numbers_and_the_presss_desire_to_believe.php|archive-date=2007-01-01|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Customer security ===\nOn September 8, 2006, Linden Lab released a news bulletin that revealed their ''Second Life'' database had been compromised and customer information, including encrypted passwords and users' real names, had likely been accessed.<ref name=\"lindenblog-urgent-security-announcement\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/09/08/urgent-security-announcement/|title=Urgent Security Announcement|author=Linden, Robin|date=September 8, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref><ref name=\"secondlifedotcom-security-bulletins\">{{cite web|url=http://secondlife.com/corporate/bulletin.php|title=Second Life Security Bulletin|author=Linden Lab|date=September 8, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025064746/http://secondlife.com/corporate/bulletin.php|archivedate=October 25, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> However, it was later revealed that the hacker had in fact been focused on trying to cheat the in-world money system<ref name=\"lindenblog-security-breach-update\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/09/22/security-breach-update/|title=Security breach update|author=Linden, Ian|date=September 22, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> and their access to personal information was believed incidental, although a full alert was still raised for safety's sake.\n\n=== Fraud and intellectual property protection ===\nAlthough ''Second Life''{{'}}s client and server incorporate [[digital rights management]] technology, the visual data of an object must ultimately be sent to the client in order for it to be drawn; thus unofficial third-party clients can bypass them.

This has led to occurrences of low-level fraud within ''Second Life'', in which users swindle other users out of money (via [[Linden dollar]]s which are later traded for real money). Linden Lab will not act on such fraud, and the amounts of money involved are usually small enough (less than US$100) that it is unlikely the victim will wish to spend the money and effort involved in real-life legal proceedings.\n\n=== False DMCA takedown notices ===\nThere have been issues with the use of false DMCA [[takedown notice]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slfreshbakedgoods.blogspot.com/2008/09/sweet-justice.html|title=~*Fresh Baked Goods*~: Sweet Justice...?|date=September 10, 2008|publisher=Slfreshbakedgoods.blogspot.com|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> Once a DMCA takedown notice is served, reversing it requires an individual to expose his personal information to the filer (filing a notice does not require this); for the penalty of perjury to be enacted, a lawsuit is required (anything less, the false DMCA claimer can just claim it from a different account every week causing legitimate business unlimited losses).

The fee for 4 OpenSpaces was identical to that for a single private region. However, in March 2008, this rule was modified to permit OpenSpaces to be bought individually and placed elsewhere, as well as increasing the prim load each one could handle. OpenSpaces were made available for a US$415 downpayment plus a US$75 monthly fee.\n\nIn October 2008, Linden Lab announced that the OpenSpaces being used for this purpose were being misused; there was in fact no technical throttle limiting their usage. Linden Lab raised the monthly fee per OpenSpace to US$125, the same cost as half a region; added an avatar limit of 20; and renamed it to Homestead.\n\nA week after the initial announcement Linden Lab stated its intention to add technical limits. A revised Openspace product, with far fewer prims, a no-residency rule, and costing the same monthly amount, was announced.\n\nIn May 2009, Linden Lab announced they were \"grandfathering\" OpenSpace sims (now rebranded as \"Homesteads\"), after a protracted protest movement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foo.secondlifeherald.com/slh/2008/10/save-our-open-s.html|title=Open Spaces Protest Closes Nautilus Sim! &#124; The Alphaville Herald|date=|publisher=Foo.secondlifeherald.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref> caused a major amount of negative publicity and funded potential litigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sl-newspaper-bnc.blogspot.com/2008/11/intlibber-brautigan-on-openspace-policy.html|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ace-exchange.com/symbol/SOS/profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207091918/http://www.ace-exchange.com/symbol/SOS/profile|date=February 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/land/blog/2009/05/26/good-news-homestead-pricing-to-be-grandfathered-if-purchased-before-july-1st-2009|title=Land - Second Life|date=|publisher=Blogs.secondlife.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Marketing ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2009}}\nLinden Lab has been accused{{who|date=February 2013}} of manipulation of user count statistics to make the world seem more popular than it is. This includes counting multiple avatars created by the same real person as separate accounts, never removing accounts from the database no matter how long they have been idle, counting accounts which are created for free and which never pay any money into the game equally with those that do, and implementing in-world systems which encourage the creation of bogus extra accounts (for example, \"traffic bots\" which simply remain stationary in a store, causing the system to rank the store as popular because there are people there).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-08/ff_sheep?currentPage=1|title=How Madison Avenue Is Wasting Millions on a Deserted Second Life|author=Frank Rose|date=2007-07-24|accessdate=2009-03-08|publisher=Wired.com}}</ref><ref>Rolph, Shaun. \"[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/02/20/second_life_analysis/ The phony economics of Second Life].\" ''[[The Register]]''.

When a teen turned 18, he/she was transferred from the Teen Grid to the Main Grid. Linden Lab had received controversy for the lack of integration between teens and adults. The teen grid and the adult grid actually were technically parts of one grid called [[Agni]], due to ''Second Life''{{'}}s tradition of naming grids after [[Hindu gods]]. However, teen residents could not access the adult regions, and adult residents could not access the teen regions. Underage users, who were under 18 in real life, were not allowed onto the main grid, and being an underage user there was an offense that could be abuse reported.\n\nOn 19 January 2009, Linden Lab, Philip Linden related (in an interview with Metanomics) an intent to merge the two grids into one. This immediately attracted uproar on SL's private forums, largely from residents who feared they would be required to use the unpopular age verification system, and would be permanently under threat of a false sex-related allegation or lawsuit by a teenager or his/her parents.\n\nThe Main and Teen Grids were merged, with the Teen Grid being partially split up by age.

This included [[Grey goo|Grey Goo]] objects which infinitely reproduce, eventually overwhelming the servers;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6164806.stm |title='Worm' attacks Second Life world |accessdate=2007-01-23 | work=BBC News | date=2006-11-20}}</ref> ''orbiters'' which throw an avatar so far upwards they cannot get back down in a reasonable timeframe without teleporting; ''cages'' which surround avatars, preventing them from moving, and similar tools. Although combat between users is sanctioned in certain areas of the world, these objects have been used to cause disruption in all areas. Attacks on the grid itself, such as Grey Goo, are strictly forbidden anywhere on the grid. It was possible to perpetrate DoS (Denial of Service) attacks on other users simply by scripting objects that spew screen filling characters from anywhere on the grid to another avatar's location, thereby disabling a clear view to the virtual world. Such attacks were quickly blocked with the use of the \"mute\" tool. Bugs in the client and server software were also exploited by griefers to kick users, crash servers, and revert content; however, such exploits were promptly fixed by Linden Lab. <ref>{{cite web |title=Second Life Bug Tracker |url=https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/STORM-836?filter=-4&jql=ORDER%20BY%20created%20ASC |website=jira.secondlife.com |accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Unauthorized copying of content====\n''Second Life'' features a built-in [[digital rights management]] system that controls the movement of textures, sounds, scripts, and models with the ''Second Life'' servers at Linden Lab. At some point, though, this data must be sent to a user's computer to be displayed or played\u2014an issue fundamental to any system attempting to apply restrictions to digital information.\n\nIn November 2006 controversy arose over a tool called [[CopyBot]], developed as part of [[libsecondlife]] and was intended to allow users to legitimately back up their ''Second Life'' data. For a brief period, an unmodified CopyBot allowed any user to replicate SL items or avatars (although not scripts, which run only on the servers at Linden Lab). Later changes to the SecondLife protocols prevented unmodified copies of CopyBot from working. Nevertheless, the basic issue of users being able to duplicate content that is sent to them remains.\n\nResidents who copy content belonging to other users face being banned from ''Second Life'', but Linden Lab has so far never sued any of these users for copyright infringement; since the resident creators (and not Linden Lab) retain ownership of the rights, it is not clear whether Linden Lab would legally be able to do so. Linden Lab does, however, comply with DMCA [[takedown notice]]s served to them against resident content; serving a DMCA Takedown Notice is the normal procedure recommended by Linden Lab for having copyrighted content illegally resold on ''Second Life''.\n\nAny user who uploads, publishes or submits any content keeps the intellectual property rights of that content, however both Linden Lab and other users gain their own rights from your content. Linden Lab receives a content license from anything a user uploads to the server. Section 7.3 of the ''Second Life'' Terms of Service states; \"you hereby automatically grant Linden Lab a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sub-license able, and transferable licence to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the content solely for the purpose of providing and promoting the service\".\nA user who uploads their content to a public area also gives a content licence to other users as well, which allows other users to replicate and record for use in Machinima (as outlined in section 7.4, Snapshot and Machinima Policy).<ref name=\"Second Life Terms of Service\">{{cite web |url=http://secondlife.com/corporate/tos.php |title=Second Life Terms of Service |accessdate=2007-01-23 | work=Linden Lab | date=2006-11-20}}</ref>\n\nRegardless of what rights and licences are given, Linden Lab takes no responsibility for the outcome of any dispute between users or the server regarding content. Section 10.2 states; \"you release Linden Lab (and its officers, directors, shareholders, agents, subsidiaries, and employees) from claims, demands, losses, liabilities and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have or claim to have with one or more users, including whether or not Linden Lab becomes involved in any resolution or attempted resolution of the dispute\". Section 10.3 repeats a similar passage but regarding the responsibility of Linden Lab during any data or technical fault.<ref name=\"Second Life Terms of Service\" />\n\n== International issues ==\n=== Legality ===\n{{OR section|date=June 2017}}\nSecond Life users are expected to obey the laws of their own local countries with regard to their actions in the virtual world; however, a problem can arise in countries which have tough laws regarding material downloaded from the Internet, such as pornography. It is possible, for example, for a US user - even in a non-adult area \u2013 to approach German users and create an object displaying an obscene uploaded image which is illegal under German law but legal under US law. Although the US user has broken the ''Second Life'' terms of services as a result, and faces suspension or banning from ''Second Life'', the German user has broken a real-life sex offense law by downloading the image and faces a far worse penalty. Even if the user is eventually deemed to not be responsible for this download because it was unsolicited, they will still have been investigated for a sex offense. However, no actual prosecutions have resulted from actions of this type so far.\n\n=== Taxation ===\nIn late 2006, Linden Lab announced that, in accordance to sales tax regulations of the [[European Union]] (EU), they are required to charge ''value added tax'' (VAT) to EU residents on all money transactions involving the company. However, Linden Lab waives VAT to users who have a VAT registration ID.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Value_Added_Tax_%28VAT%29_Frequently_Asked_Questions|title = Linden Lab Official:Value Added Tax (VAT) Frequently Asked Questions|date = 29 November 2012|accessdate = 3 September 2014|website = Second Life Wiki|publisher = Linden Lab|last = |first = }}</ref> The introduction of VAT caused controversy with EU users, mostly among content creators who protested that the addition of VAT caused a disadvantage in comparison to competitors living outside the EU.\n\n==Litigation==\n===''Bragg v.

Linden Lab}}\nIn 2006, attorney Marc Bragg sued Linden Lab, claiming that it had illegally deprived him of access to his account<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/news/2006/05/70909 |title=Second Life Land Deal Goes Sour |publisher=Wired.com |date= 2006-05-18|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> after he discovered a loophole in the online land auction system which allowed regions to be purchased at prices below [[reserve price|reserve]]. Although most users and commentators believed that Bragg would have no chance of winning, a number of legal developments occurred as a result of the case, including a court ruling that parts of the ''Second Life'' Terms of Service were unenforceable, due to being an unconscionable [[contract of adhesion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14176 |title=Gamasutra - Judge Rules Against Second Life Terms Of Service |publisher=Gamasutra.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> The case eventually ended with Bragg's virtual land and account being restored to him in a confidential out-of-court settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://virtuallyblind.com/2007/10/04/bragg-linden-lab-settlement/ |title=Bragg v.

He also comments on the phenomenon of data becoming \"part of social context\" that has been observed both inside and outside of ''Second Life'' as surveillance becomes more integrated into everyday life. He stresses the difference between the concepts of anonymity and pseudonymity, identifying ''Second Life'' users as belonging to the latter group of people - though their avatars are not directly linked to their real identities and reputations, they have forged new ones in this online space, a unique effect of creating an online persona in the digital age. \n\n== See also ==\n* [[Active Worlds]]\n* [[Anteworld]]\n* [[blaxxun]]\n* [[Cyberformance]]\n* [[Libraries in virtual worlds]]\n* [[PlayStation Home]]\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n* [[Smeet]]\n* [[Social simulation game]]\n* [[The Sims Online]]\n* [[Virtual reality]]\n* [[NCSoft#Worlds.com patent lawsuit|Worlds.com]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Hillis, Ken.

As it does not have any stipulated goals, it is irrelevant to talk about winning or losing in relation to ''Second Life''. Likewise, unlike a traditional talker{{Vague|date=May 2015}}, ''Second Life'' contains an extensive world that can be explored and interacted with, and it can be used purely as a creative tool set if the user so chooses.

A Premium membership (US$11.99 monthly, US$32.97 quarterly, or US$99 annually) extends access to an increased level of technical support, and also pays an automatic stipend of L$300/week into the member's avatar account, and after 45 days that resident will receive a L$700 bonus, making it L$1,000 for that week.  This amount has decreased since the original stipend of L$500, which is still paid to older accounts.  Certain accounts created during an earlier period may receive L$400. This stipend, if changed into USD, means that the actual cost for the benefit of extended tech support for an annual payment of US$72 is only about US$14, depending on the currency exchange rates. However, the vast majority of casual users of ''Second Life'' do not upgrade beyond the free \"basic\" account.\n\nAvatars may take any form users choose (human, animal, vegetable, mineral, or a combination thereof) or residents may choose to resemble themselves as they are in real life.<ref>{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.weburbanist.com/2007/06/17/top-3-look-alike-avatars-and-people-from-second-life-to-real-life/\n|title=Second Life Avatars and their Real Life |publisher=Web Urbanist\n|accessdate = June 18, 2007\n|date=2007-06-17 }}</ref> They may choose even more abstract forms, given that almost every aspect of an avatar is fully customizable. [[Second Life Culture|''Second Life'' Culture]] consists of many activities and behaviors that are also present in real life. A single resident account may have only one avatar at a time, although the appearance of this avatar can change between as many different forms as the Resident wishes. Avatar forms, like almost everything else in Second Life, can be either created by the user, or bought pre-made. A single person may also have multiple accounts, and thus appear to be multiple Residents (a person's multiple accounts are referred to as ''[[Alternate character|alts]]'').\n\nAvatars can travel via walking, running, vehicular access, flying, or teleportation. Because ''Second Life'' is such a vast virtual world, teleportation is used when avatars wish to travel instantly and efficiently. Once they reach their destination, they may travel in more conventional means at various speeds.\n\nAvatars can communicate via local chat, group chat, global instant messaging (known as IM), and voice (public, private and group). Chatting is used for localized public conversations between two or more avatars, and is visible to any avatar within a given distance. IMs are used for private conversations, either between two avatars, or among the members of a group, or even between objects and avatars. Unlike chatting, IM communication does not depend on the participants being within a certain distance of each other. As of version 1.18.1.2 (2007-Aug-02), voice chat, both local and IM, was also available.\nInstant messages may optionally be sent to a Resident's email when the Resident is logged off, although message length is limited to 4096 bytes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlEmail |title=LlEmail \u2013 Second Life Wiki |publisher=Wiki.secondlife.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIdentities in ''Second Life'' can relate to the users' personality or creating their own character. It is based on their decisions on how to express themselves. Most avatars are human, but they can choose to be vampires or animals. Sometimes, what they choose does not relate to their offline selves.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Anna |editor1-last=Peachey |editor2-first=Mark |editor2-last=Childs |title=Reinventing ourselves : contemporary concepts of identity in virtual worlds |year=2011 |publisher=Springer |location=London |isbn=978-085729-360-2 |author=Anna Peachey |authorlink=Avatars and Virtual Worlds |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=48P5tVhoWaIC&dq=Reinventing+ourselves+:+contemporary+concepts+of+identity+in+virtual+worlds |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human'', anthropologist Tom Boellstorff notes that the interface of ''Second Life'' is designed with the purpose of disconnecting a player's virtual identity from their physical identity in mind.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Boellstorff|first=Tom|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=jW2YDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=second+life&ots=YRz3mB8aWb&sig=b30tlm1KhwiPLCwZ5F8hvUDFoZE#v=onepage&q=second%20life&f=false|title=Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human|date=2015-08-25|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-16834-0|language=en}}</ref> As of 2015 ''Second Life'' has made it possible to display one's legal name in the player's profile or as their screen name, but when Boellstorff first published the book in 2008 users were required to select a last name from a pre-determined list of options.

The complexities of those encounters depend on the engagement levels of the people behind the avatars, whether they are engaging Disassociatively (entertainment only), Immersively (as if the avatar was them), or Augmentatively (meaning they engage for a real-life purpose).<ref>Clift, Pamala, \u2033Virgin\u2032s Handbook on Virtual Relationships\u2033, Chapt.6, 2012 (CreateSpace){{ISBN|1463666993}}</ref>\n\n=== Science ===\n''Second Life'' is used for scientific research, collaboration, and data visualization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journal.chemistrycentral.com/content/3/1/14 |title=Chemistry in Second Life |publisher=Journal.chemistrycentral.com |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2010}}</ref> Examples include SciLands, American Chemical Society's ACS Island, Genome, Virginia Tech's SLATE, and Nature Publishing Group's Elucian Islands Village.\n\n=== Social network ===\n''Second Life'' can be a real-time, immersive social space for people including those with physical or mental disabilities that impair their first lives, who often find comfort and security interacting through anonymous avatars.

Issues range from the technical ([[Real estate (Second Life)#Budgeting of server resources|budgeting of server resources]]), to moral ([[Second Life issues and criticisms#Pornography|pornography]]), to legal ([[Economy of Second Life#Legal position of the Linden Dollar|legal position of the Linden Dollar]], ''[[Bragg v. Linden Lab]]''). Security issues have also been a concern.\n\n=== Regulation ===\nIn the past, large portions of the ''Second Life'' economy consisted of businesses that are regulated or banned. Changes to ''Second Life''{{'}}s Terms of Service in this regard have largely had the purpose of bringing activity within ''Second Life'' into compliance with various international laws, even though the person running the business may be in full compliance with the law in their own country.\n\nOn July 26, 2007, Linden Lab announced a ban on in-world gambling due to federal and state regulations on Internet gambling that could affect Linden Lab if it was permitted to continue. The ban was immediately met with in-world protests.<ref name=\"libsl-sl-gambling-banned\">{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201201441|\ntitle=Gambling Banned in Second Life|\naccessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2007, a $750,000 in-world Linden Dollar bank or [[Ponzi scheme]] called [[Ginko Financial]] collapsed due to a [[bank run]] triggered by Linden Lab's ban on gambling.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ginko Financial's End-Game |url=http://alphavilleherald.com/2007/08/ginko-financial-2.html |website=The Alpha Herald |accessdate=28 November 2019 |date=6 August 2007}}</ref> The aftershocks of this collapse caused severe liquidity problems for other virtual \"Linden Dollar banks\", which critics had long asserted were scams.

These include increased system latency, and intermittent client crashes. However, some faults are caused by the system's use of an \"asset server\" cluster, on which the actual data governing objects is stored separately from the areas of the world and the avatars that use those objects. The communication between the main servers and the asset cluster appears to constitute a [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] which frequently causes problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massively.com/2008/01/06/second-life-grid-closed-due-to-asset-problems/ |title=Second Life grid closed due to asset problems \u2013 Massively |publisher=Massively.com |author=Tateru Nino |date= January 6, 2008 <!-- at 10:30 am --> |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/features/blog/2008/03/28/resolved-asset-server-issues |title=RESOLVED&#93; Asset Server Issues \u00ab Official Second Life Blog |publisher=Blog.secondlife.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondlifeinsider.com/2007/06/12/asset-server-issues/ |title=Asset server issues \u2013 Second Life Insider |publisher=Secondlifeinsider.com |author=Eloise PasteurFiled under: LSL, Gridbugs |date= June 12, 2007 |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref> Typically, when asset server downtime is announced, users are advised not to build, manipulate objects, or engage in business, leaving them with little to do but chat and generally reducing confidence in all businesses on the grid.\n\nAnother problem is inventory loss,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/UPDATED-Experiencing-inventory-loss-Read-on/ba-p/573214 |title=UPDATED&#93; Experiencing inventory loss?

Linden Lab offers no compensation for items that are lost in this way, although a policy change instituted in 2008 allows accounts to file support tickets when inventory loss occurs. Many in-world businesses will attempt to compensate for this or restore items, although they are under no obligation to do so and not all are able to do so. A recent change in how the company handles items which have \"lost their parent directory\" means that inventory loss is much less of a problem and resolves faster than in recent years. \"Loss to recovery times\" have gone from months (or never) to hours or a day or two for the majority of users, but inventory loss does still exist.\n\n''Second Life'' functions by streaming all data to the user live over the Internet with minimal local caching of frequently used data. The user is expected to have a minimum of 300kbit/s of Internet bandwidth for basic functionality. Due to the proprietary communications protocols, it is not possible to use a network proxy service to reduce network load when many people are all using the same location, such as when used for group activities in a school or business.\n\n=== Quality assurance ===\nCriticism of [[Software Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] of [[Second Life]] states that [[Linden Lab]] focuses too much on bringing new features to the production environment instead of fixing long-standing bugs that, in the worst case, cause financial loss for the users. On April 30, 2007, an open letter signed by over 3,000<ref name=\"secondlife-openletter-signers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.projectopenletter.com/News.aspx|title=Open Letters News, 5/1/2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503011341/http://www.projectopenletter.com/News.aspx|archivedate=May 3, 2007|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> users was sent to Linden Lab to protest the [[Software Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] process of the company.<ref name=\"secondlife-openletter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.projectopenletter.com/|title=Project Open Letter|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602235847/http://projectopenletter.com/|archive-date=2007-06-02|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref> Linden Lab has responded to the open letter.<ref name=\"secondlife-openletter-response\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/04/30/project-open-letter/|title=Response to the Open Letter|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506125440/http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/04/30/project-open-letter/|archivedate=May 6, 2007|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Frame rate ===\nComputer hardware and Internet connections capable of smoothly rendering high quality content in other [[MMOG]]s may perform poorly in ''Second Life'', resulting in low [[frame rate]]s and unresponsive controls on even minimal graphical configurations. The problem is especially prevalent when large numbers of avatars congregate in one area. The problem is largely due to the fact that the world is entirely user created, and the majority of content created by users is made without any sort of basic graphical optimization. As a result, objects with both unnecessarily high polygon counts, and unnecessarily high resolution textures are prevalent. It is not uncommon for users to have to download and use, upwards of dozens of times, the amount of resources than would actually be required for the equivalent visual result. Certain areas have guidelines for script usage, which helps reduce lag by reducing resources used server-side, but does nothing to alleviate the primary issue above.\n\n=== Congestion ===\nA single region (65536&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of land hosted on a single [[CPU]]) is set to accommodate a limited number of Residents (40 on 'mainland' regions, up to 100 on private islands),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.secondlife.com/ics/support/KBAnswer.asp?questionID=4010|accessdate=June 24, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> causing some popular locations such as teleportation points to become inaccessible at times. It is possible for an area of land a Resident has paid for to become inaccessible because another area in the same region has exhausted the avatar limit.\n\n=== Interface ===\nThe control scheme for ''Second Life'' combines controls useful for 3D editing with those useful for game play, which can be highly unintuitive for many. This requires various combinations of [[Alt key|alt]], [[Control key|ctrl]], and the mouse for basic manipulation of the camera and in-world objects. Also, everything in the player's possession\u2014textures, animations, objects, clothing, sounds, videos\u2014shares a common directory tree, and can quickly become cluttered if not carefully managed.\n\n=== Alternative accounts ===\nThe ability for a single real individual to create an unlimited number of accounts for free could have the effect of highly exaggerating the \"residence\" figures. Blogs and forum posts regularly allege exaggerated membership and performance claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/I-ll-See-Your-Million-and-Raise-You-a-Million/ba-p/544153|title=I'll See Your Million\u2026 and Raise You a Million \u00ab Official Second Life Blog|publisher=Blog.secondlife.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203013528/http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/I-ll-See-Your-Million-and-Raise-You-a-Million/ba-p/544153|archive-date=2014-02-03|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/12/26/lindens_second_life_numbers_and_the_presss_desire_to_believe.php|title=Linden's Second Life numbers and the press's desire to believe|publisher=Corante|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101072536/http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/12/26/lindens_second_life_numbers_and_the_presss_desire_to_believe.php|archive-date=2007-01-01|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Customer security ===\nOn September 8, 2006, Linden Lab released a news bulletin that revealed their ''Second Life'' database had been compromised and customer information, including encrypted passwords and users' real names, had likely been accessed.<ref name=\"lindenblog-urgent-security-announcement\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/09/08/urgent-security-announcement/|title=Urgent Security Announcement|author=Linden, Robin|date=September 8, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref><ref name=\"secondlifedotcom-security-bulletins\">{{cite web|url=http://secondlife.com/corporate/bulletin.php|title=Second Life Security Bulletin|author=Linden Lab|date=September 8, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025064746/http://secondlife.com/corporate/bulletin.php|archivedate=October 25, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> However, it was later revealed that the hacker had in fact been focused on trying to cheat the in-world money system<ref name=\"lindenblog-security-breach-update\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/09/22/security-breach-update/|title=Security breach update|author=Linden, Ian|date=September 22, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> and their access to personal information was believed incidental, although a full alert was still raised for safety's sake.\n\n=== Fraud and intellectual property protection ===\nAlthough ''Second Life''{{'}}s client and server incorporate [[digital rights management]] technology, the visual data of an object must ultimately be sent to the client in order for it to be drawn; thus unofficial third-party clients can bypass them.

This has led to occurrences of low-level fraud within ''Second Life'', in which users swindle other users out of money (via [[Linden dollar]]s which are later traded for real money). Linden Lab will not act on such fraud, and the amounts of money involved are usually small enough (less than US$100) that it is unlikely the victim will wish to spend the money and effort involved in real-life legal proceedings.\n\n=== False DMCA takedown notices ===\nThere have been issues with the use of false DMCA [[takedown notice]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slfreshbakedgoods.blogspot.com/2008/09/sweet-justice.html|title=~*Fresh Baked Goods*~: Sweet Justice...?|date=September 10, 2008|publisher=Slfreshbakedgoods.blogspot.com|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> Once a DMCA takedown notice is served, reversing it requires an individual to expose his personal information to the filer (filing a notice does not require this); for the penalty of perjury to be enacted, a lawsuit is required (anything less, the false DMCA claimer can just claim it from a different account every week causing legitimate business unlimited losses).

The fee for 4 OpenSpaces was identical to that for a single private region. However, in March 2008, this rule was modified to permit OpenSpaces to be bought individually and placed elsewhere, as well as increasing the prim load each one could handle. OpenSpaces were made available for a US$415 downpayment plus a US$75 monthly fee.\n\nIn October 2008, Linden Lab announced that the OpenSpaces being used for this purpose were being misused; there was in fact no technical throttle limiting their usage. Linden Lab raised the monthly fee per OpenSpace to US$125, the same cost as half a region; added an avatar limit of 20; and renamed it to Homestead.\n\nA week after the initial announcement Linden Lab stated its intention to add technical limits. A revised Openspace product, with far fewer prims, a no-residency rule, and costing the same monthly amount, was announced.\n\nIn May 2009, Linden Lab announced they were \"grandfathering\" OpenSpace sims (now rebranded as \"Homesteads\"), after a protracted protest movement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foo.secondlifeherald.com/slh/2008/10/save-our-open-s.html|title=Open Spaces Protest Closes Nautilus Sim! &#124; The Alphaville Herald|date=|publisher=Foo.secondlifeherald.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref> caused a major amount of negative publicity and funded potential litigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sl-newspaper-bnc.blogspot.com/2008/11/intlibber-brautigan-on-openspace-policy.html|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ace-exchange.com/symbol/SOS/profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207091918/http://www.ace-exchange.com/symbol/SOS/profile|date=February 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/land/blog/2009/05/26/good-news-homestead-pricing-to-be-grandfathered-if-purchased-before-july-1st-2009|title=Land - Second Life|date=|publisher=Blogs.secondlife.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Marketing ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2009}}\nLinden Lab has been accused{{who|date=February 2013}} of manipulation of user count statistics to make the world seem more popular than it is. This includes counting multiple avatars created by the same real person as separate accounts, never removing accounts from the database no matter how long they have been idle, counting accounts which are created for free and which never pay any money into the game equally with those that do, and implementing in-world systems which encourage the creation of bogus extra accounts (for example, \"traffic bots\" which simply remain stationary in a store, causing the system to rank the store as popular because there are people there).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-08/ff_sheep?currentPage=1|title=How Madison Avenue Is Wasting Millions on a Deserted Second Life|author=Frank Rose|date=2007-07-24|accessdate=2009-03-08|publisher=Wired.com}}</ref><ref>Rolph, Shaun. \"[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/02/20/second_life_analysis/ The phony economics of Second Life].\" ''[[The Register]]''.

When a teen turned 18, he/she was transferred from the Teen Grid to the Main Grid. Linden Lab had received controversy for the lack of integration between teens and adults. The teen grid and the adult grid actually were technically parts of one grid called [[Agni]], due to ''Second Life''{{'}}s tradition of naming grids after [[Hindu gods]]. However, teen residents could not access the adult regions, and adult residents could not access the teen regions. Underage users, who were under 18 in real life, were not allowed onto the main grid, and being an underage user there was an offense that could be abuse reported.\n\nOn 19 January 2009, Linden Lab, Philip Linden related (in an interview with Metanomics) an intent to merge the two grids into one. This immediately attracted uproar on SL's private forums, largely from residents who feared they would be required to use the unpopular age verification system, and would be permanently under threat of a false sex-related allegation or lawsuit by a teenager or his/her parents.\n\nThe Main and Teen Grids were merged, with the Teen Grid being partially split up by age.

This included [[Grey goo|Grey Goo]] objects which infinitely reproduce, eventually overwhelming the servers;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6164806.stm |title='Worm' attacks Second Life world |accessdate=2007-01-23 | work=BBC News | date=2006-11-20}}</ref> ''orbiters'' which throw an avatar so far upwards they cannot get back down in a reasonable timeframe without teleporting; ''cages'' which surround avatars, preventing them from moving, and similar tools. Although combat between users is sanctioned in certain areas of the world, these objects have been used to cause disruption in all areas. Attacks on the grid itself, such as Grey Goo, are strictly forbidden anywhere on the grid. It was possible to perpetrate DoS (Denial of Service) attacks on other users simply by scripting objects that spew screen filling characters from anywhere on the grid to another avatar's location, thereby disabling a clear view to the virtual world. Such attacks were quickly blocked with the use of the \"mute\" tool. Bugs in the client and server software were also exploited by griefers to kick users, crash servers, and revert content; however, such exploits were promptly fixed by Linden Lab. <ref>{{cite web |title=Second Life Bug Tracker |url=https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/STORM-836?filter=-4&jql=ORDER%20BY%20created%20ASC |website=jira.secondlife.com |accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Unauthorized copying of content====\n''Second Life'' features a built-in [[digital rights management]] system that controls the movement of textures, sounds, scripts, and models with the ''Second Life'' servers at Linden Lab. At some point, though, this data must be sent to a user's computer to be displayed or played\u2014an issue fundamental to any system attempting to apply restrictions to digital information.\n\nIn November 2006 controversy arose over a tool called [[CopyBot]], developed as part of [[libsecondlife]] and was intended to allow users to legitimately back up their ''Second Life'' data. For a brief period, an unmodified CopyBot allowed any user to replicate SL items or avatars (although not scripts, which run only on the servers at Linden Lab). Later changes to the SecondLife protocols prevented unmodified copies of CopyBot from working. Nevertheless, the basic issue of users being able to duplicate content that is sent to them remains.\n\nResidents who copy content belonging to other users face being banned from ''Second Life'', but Linden Lab has so far never sued any of these users for copyright infringement; since the resident creators (and not Linden Lab) retain ownership of the rights, it is not clear whether Linden Lab would legally be able to do so. Linden Lab does, however, comply with DMCA [[takedown notice]]s served to them against resident content; serving a DMCA Takedown Notice is the normal procedure recommended by Linden Lab for having copyrighted content illegally resold on ''Second Life''.\n\nAny user who uploads, publishes or submits any content keeps the intellectual property rights of that content, however both Linden Lab and other users gain their own rights from your content. Linden Lab receives a content license from anything a user uploads to the server. Section 7.3 of the ''Second Life'' Terms of Service states; \"you hereby automatically grant Linden Lab a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sub-license able, and transferable licence to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the content solely for the purpose of providing and promoting the service\".\nA user who uploads their content to a public area also gives a content licence to other users as well, which allows other users to replicate and record for use in Machinima (as outlined in section 7.4, Snapshot and Machinima Policy).<ref name=\"Second Life Terms of Service\">{{cite web |url=http://secondlife.com/corporate/tos.php |title=Second Life Terms of Service |accessdate=2007-01-23 | work=Linden Lab | date=2006-11-20}}</ref>\n\nRegardless of what rights and licences are given, Linden Lab takes no responsibility for the outcome of any dispute between users or the server regarding content. Section 10.2 states; \"you release Linden Lab (and its officers, directors, shareholders, agents, subsidiaries, and employees) from claims, demands, losses, liabilities and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have or claim to have with one or more users, including whether or not Linden Lab becomes involved in any resolution or attempted resolution of the dispute\". Section 10.3 repeats a similar passage but regarding the responsibility of Linden Lab during any data or technical fault.<ref name=\"Second Life Terms of Service\" />\n\n== International issues ==\n=== Legality ===\n{{OR section|date=June 2017}}\nSecond Life users are expected to obey the laws of their own local countries with regard to their actions in the virtual world; however, a problem can arise in countries which have tough laws regarding material downloaded from the Internet, such as pornography. It is possible, for example, for a US user - even in a non-adult area \u2013 to approach German users and create an object displaying an obscene uploaded image which is illegal under German law but legal under US law. Although the US user has broken the ''Second Life'' terms of services as a result, and faces suspension or banning from ''Second Life'', the German user has broken a real-life sex offense law by downloading the image and faces a far worse penalty. Even if the user is eventually deemed to not be responsible for this download because it was unsolicited, they will still have been investigated for a sex offense. However, no actual prosecutions have resulted from actions of this type so far.\n\n=== Taxation ===\nIn late 2006, Linden Lab announced that, in accordance to sales tax regulations of the [[European Union]] (EU), they are required to charge ''value added tax'' (VAT) to EU residents on all money transactions involving the company. However, Linden Lab waives VAT to users who have a VAT registration ID.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Value_Added_Tax_%28VAT%29_Frequently_Asked_Questions|title = Linden Lab Official:Value Added Tax (VAT) Frequently Asked Questions|date = 29 November 2012|accessdate = 3 September 2014|website = Second Life Wiki|publisher = Linden Lab|last = |first = }}</ref> The introduction of VAT caused controversy with EU users, mostly among content creators who protested that the addition of VAT caused a disadvantage in comparison to competitors living outside the EU.\n\n==Litigation==\n===''Bragg v.

Linden Lab}}\nIn 2006, attorney Marc Bragg sued Linden Lab, claiming that it had illegally deprived him of access to his account<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/news/2006/05/70909 |title=Second Life Land Deal Goes Sour |publisher=Wired.com |date= 2006-05-18|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> after he discovered a loophole in the online land auction system which allowed regions to be purchased at prices below [[reserve price|reserve]]. Although most users and commentators believed that Bragg would have no chance of winning, a number of legal developments occurred as a result of the case, including a court ruling that parts of the ''Second Life'' Terms of Service were unenforceable, due to being an unconscionable [[contract of adhesion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14176 |title=Gamasutra - Judge Rules Against Second Life Terms Of Service |publisher=Gamasutra.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> The case eventually ended with Bragg's virtual land and account being restored to him in a confidential out-of-court settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://virtuallyblind.com/2007/10/04/bragg-linden-lab-settlement/ |title=Bragg v.

Boellstorff explores the relationship between anonymity and community when everyone in a community belongs to varying degrees of anonymity, and how this feeds into the idea of digital collectivity. He also comments on the phenomenon of data becoming \"part of social context\" that has been observed both inside and outside of ''Second Life'' as surveillance becomes more integrated into everyday life. He stresses the difference between the concepts of anonymity and pseudonymity, identifying ''Second Life'' users as belonging to the latter group of people - though their avatars are not directly linked to their real identities and reputations, they have forged new ones in this online space, a unique effect of creating an online persona in the digital age. \n\n== See also ==\n* [[Active Worlds]]\n* [[Anteworld]]\n* [[blaxxun]]\n* [[Cyberformance]]\n* [[Libraries in virtual worlds]]\n* [[PlayStation Home]]\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n* [[Smeet]]\n* [[Social simulation game]]\n* [[The Sims Online]]\n* [[Virtual reality]]\n* [[NCSoft#Worlds.com patent lawsuit|Worlds.com]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Hillis, Ken.

In 1872, the $243,000 federal allotment to Georgia was invested to create a $16,000 annual income used to establish the Georgia State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (A&M), initially separate and independent from the University of Georgia. However, A&M's funding was considered part of the university, which helped save it from bankruptcy during the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\":4\" /> As a land-grant school, UGA was required to provide military training, which the university began to offer in the 1870s.<ref name=\":5\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=5}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of the university's extracurricular organizations began in the late 1800s. In 1886, fraternities at UGA began publishing the school's yearbook, the ''Pandora''. The same year, the university gained its first intercollegiate sport when a baseball team was formed, followed by a football team formed in 1892. Both teams played in a small field west of campus now known as [[Herty Field]]. The Demosthenian and [[Phi Kappa Literary Society|Phi Kappa]] literary societies together formed the student paper, ''[[The Red & Black (University of Georgia)|The Red & Black]]'', in 1883.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 1894, the University of Georgia joined six other southeastern schools to form the [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (SIAA).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyqWE2wlYJ4C|title=How the SEC Became Goliath: The Making of College Football's Most Dominant Conference|last=Glier|first=Ray|date=September 25, 2012|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4767-0328-2|pages=23|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|20th century}}<!-- Anchor for redirects of [college] articles; caution. -->\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[File:Mary Ethel Creswell graduation photo 1919.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Mary Ethel Creswell]], in 1919, the first woman to earn an undergraduate degree at the university]]\nThe turn of the century brought many changes in the administration and organization of the university including the naming of a new chancellor in 1899. [[Walter Barnard Hill|Walter B. Hill]] became the first UGA alumnus to lead the university. A progressive and enlightened leader, his six-year tenure, before his death from pneumonia, was marked with increased enrollment, expansion of the university's course offerings, and the addition of state funding through appropriation, for the first time bringing the university's annual income to over $100,000 in 1902. Hill and his successors [[David Crenshaw Barrow Jr.|David C. Barrow]] (1906\u20131925), [[Charles Mercer Snelling|Charles Snelling]] (1926\u20131932), and [[Steadman Vincent Sanford|Steadman Sanford]] (1932\u20131935) would grow the school to take on the role of a true university.<ref name=\":5\" /> Many of the university's schools and colleges were established during Barrow's tenure. The College of Education (1908), the [[University of Georgia Graduate School|Graduate School]] (1910), the [[Terry College of Business|School of Commerce]] (1912), the [[Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication|School of Journalism]] (1915), and the [[University of Georgia College of Family and Consumer Sciences|Division of Home Economics]] (1918) were all established during this period. In 1906, UGA also incorporated the [[University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences|College of Agriculture]] by bringing together A&M (agricultural and mechanical) courses. The college of science and engineering continued as formed in the previous century. Connor Hall became the first building built in South Campus and first of several buildings that housed the university's agriculture programs on what came to be known as \"Ag Hill\". In 1914, the first [[Phi Beta Kappa]] chapter in the state of Georgia was founded at UGA.<ref name=\":6\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=6}}</ref> In 1923, another honor society, [[Phi Kappa Phi]], established a chapter at the university.<ref>{{Harvnb|Boney|2000|p=113}}</ref> In 1920, UGA's athletic program was among 14 of the 30 universities to leave the SIAA to form the [[Southern Conference]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cm1TZA6jCSgC|title=SEC Football: 75 Years of Pride and Passion|last=Scott|first=Richard|date=September 15, 2008|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-1-61673-133-5|pages=16|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWith students limited to white males for the first century of its history, the University of Georgia began admitting white female students during the summer of 1903 as postgraduate students to the [[State Normal School (Athens, Georgia)|State Normal School]] established in 1893 a few miles west of the campus. When the University of Georgia established a graduate school in 1910, female students were permitted to attend summer classes and some were also unofficially allowed to attend regular classes, as well.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=6\u20137}}</ref> However, at that time only junior college transfers majoring in Home Economics were integrated into regular courses.<ref name=\":6\" /> Before official admission of women to the university, several women were able to complete graduate degrees through credit earned during the summer sessions.

The State Normal School (later State Teachers College) was fully absorbed by the College of Education, with the former's previous campus becoming UGA's Coordinate Campus. UGA and [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] traded several school programs; all engineering programs (except agriculture) were transferred to Georgia Tech and UGA received Georgia Tech's commerce program in return. The title of the university's lead administrator was changed from chancellor back to the original title of president. Sanford was named UGA's first president since 1860<ref name=\":8\" /> and was succeeded by [[Harmon White Caldwell|Harmon Caldwell]] (1935\u20131948). In 1933, the Division of Home Economics was reorganized as the [[University of Georgia College of Family and Consumer Sciences|School of Home of Economics]],<ref name=\":10\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=9}}</ref> with UGA's first female graduate, Creswell, appointed as dean.<ref name=\":9\" /> The university also became a founding member of the [[Southeastern Conference]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJUIUzD4joAC|title=Games Colleges Play: Scandal and Reform in Intercollegiate Athletics|last=Thelin|first=John R.|date=June 1, 2011|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-1-4214-0391-5|at=Chapter 2|language=en}}</ref> and established the [[University of Georgia Press]] in 1938.<ref name=\":11\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=11}}</ref><ref name=\":12\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=45}}</ref>\n\nThroughout this period, UGA's enrollment grew every year with student population reaching 3,000 by 1937 and almost 4,000 by 1941. Through President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], UGA received a $2 million infusion of funding and an additional $1 million from the state legislature. The university used the new funds to make a number of improvements to the campus from 1936 to the early 1940s. Many renovation projects were undertaken including the establishment of five new residence halls, a dining hall, eight new academic buildings, a nursery school, and several auxiliary facilities. An engineering professor Rudolph Driftmier and architect Roy Hitchcock were responsible for the design of several buildings in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]], giving the campus a homogeneous and distinctive appearance. The funds were also used to pave roads, build sidewalks, and improve the campus's landscaping.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Racial integration and the mid-20th century ===\nThe dean of the College of Education in 1941, [[Walter Cocking]], was fired by Georgia Governor [[Eugene Talmadge]] in a controversial decision known as the [[Cocking affair]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cook|first=James F|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-594|title=Cocking Affair|encyclopedia=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Georgia Humanities Council and University of Georgia Press|year=2002|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> Talmadge was motivated by his belief that Cocking favored racial integration. The governor's interference in the workings of USG's Board of Regents prompted a response by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools|Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]], which stripped UGA and nine other schools in the system of their accreditation. The issue became a major point of contention in Talmadge's 1942 re-election campaign. After his loss, a constitutional amendment passed by the state legislature gave the Board of Regents independence from political interference, which led to the schools quickly regaining their accreditation.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nAs the United States entered [[World War II]], enrollment among male students dropped significantly, allowing female students to outnumber male students for the first time in the school's history. In 1945, UGA accepted a donation of about 100 paintings from the New York art collector Alfred Holbrook and created the [[Georgia Museum of Art]]. In 1946, the [[University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine|School of Veterinary Medicine]] was re-established as a separate school, 13 years after it was discontinued as part of the agricultural college.<ref name=\":11\" /> The following year, the quarterly literary journal ''[[The Georgia Review]]'' began publication.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> After [[Jonathan Clark Rogers|Jonathan Rogers]]' brief tenure as president (1949\u20131950),<ref name=\":8\" /> [[Omer Clyde Aderhold]] started his 17-year-long stint as UGA president. During his tenure, the university sold Coordinate Campus to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]. He opened the school's main library, the Ilah Dunlap-Little Memorial Library, in 1952, and in 1964, established the [[University of Georgia School of Social Work|School of Social Work]].<ref name=\":11\" /> The university also built a new Science Center on South Campus consisting of six buildings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> After UGA's pharmacy school moved to the new facility on the South Campus, the two portions of the campus took on distinct characteristics, with North Campus focused on arts, humanities, and law, and South Campus focused on natural sciences and agricultural programs.<ref name=\":13\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Holmes-Hunter Academic Building (3), UGA.JPG|275px|thumb|left|Entrance to the Holmes-Hunter Academic Building]]\nUGA was racially integrated in 1961, with the admission of [[Hamilton E.

On January 9, 1961, three days after a court decision granting them admission, Holmes and Hunter \"walked through the Arch and into the Academic Building\" to register for classes. On the 40th anniversary of the event, the university renamed the very same prominent campus building where they registered as the Holmes-Hunter Academic Building, and the university now presents the Holmes-Hunter Lectures series, which brings noted African-American speakers to the campus each year to discuss racial issues.<ref name=\"jqstQ\">{{cite web|last1=Van Gelder|first1=Lawrence|title=Hamilton E.

Named after its last faculty occupant, it is the only remaining faculty residence house from Old North Campus. Used for a variety of purposes in the past, the building most recently houses the Office of Legal Affairs.<ref name=\"Dendy40\" /> Built in 1874, Moore College is the only remaining building constructed during post-Civil War [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]]. Originally home to the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Moore College currently houses the university's Honors Program.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=50}}</ref> The Holmes/Hunter Academic Building was simply known as the Academic Building when it was originally assembled in 1905. Following a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts architectural]] design by engineering professor Charles Strahan, the building was constructed by inserting a new building in between the older Ivy Building and Old Library. In 2001, the building was renamed after the first two African-American students at UGA.

Chief among them is The Arch which serves as the traditional entrance to the campus. Built in 1858 and modeled after the [[Seal of Georgia (U.S. state)|Great Seal of the State of Georgia]], the area near the three-columned gate is a popular venue for the staging of demonstrations, gatherings, protests, and rallies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=24}}</ref> Although the Seal's three pillars represent the state's three branches of government,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sos.georgia.gov/state_symbols/state_seal.html|title=State Seal|website=Georgia Secretary of State|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905173425/http://www.sos.ga.gov/state_symbols/state_seal.html|archive-date=September 5, 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=January 25, 2008}}</ref> the pillars of The Arch are usually taken to represent the [[Georgia (U.S. state) Constitution|Georgia Constitution]]'s three principles of wisdom, justice, and moderation, which are engraved over the pillars of the Seal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uga.edu/profile/arch.html|title=University of Georgia: History|date=August 5, 2003|website=The University of Georgia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030823125607/http://www.uga.edu/profile/arch.html|archive-date=August 23, 2003|url-status=dead|accessdate=August 12, 2015|postscript=, reprinted from Athens Magazine}}</ref> On the opposite side of the Arch Quad, at the front of the Old College building sits a statue of the university's founder Abraham Baldwin, installed by the University of Georgia Alumni Association.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=37}}</ref> The President's Club Garden, first planted in 1973 on the opposite side of the Old College building, honors the thousands of families who have made major financial contributions to the university.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=41}}</ref> A fountain named after Hubert B.

It was the first building on campus designed to be fireproof in light of the fact that several fires in UGA's history have destroyed key buildings. Originally used as the location for a library, it houses the offices of the university president and other senior administrative offices.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=35}}</ref> Hirsch Hall was built in 1932 in [[Georgian architecture|Georgian style]] and named after [[Harold Hirsch]] who for a long period served as general counsel to [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. The building is home to the School of Law and the [[Alexander Campbell King]] Law Library located in a north-side addition built in 1967. Hirsch Hall connects by way of an overhead bridge to the J.

Home to the University of Georgia Press and the ''Georgia Review'', the library serves as the headquarters to a network of secondary libraries located throughout the campus. Following the addition of a seven-story annex in 1974, the library became the third-largest academic building at UGA and the largest in North Campus.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=44\u201346}}</ref> The main library is part of a quad consisting of Hirsch Hall, Old College, Waddell Hall and Peabody Hall.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=23}}</ref> Although the aforementioned George Foster Peabody also contributed to funds used to build Peabody Hall, the building is actually named after [[George Peabody]] who in an 1869 [[testamentary trust]] created a $2.25-million fund to benefit several universities in [[Southern United States|the South]]. The University of Georgia combined $40,000 from this fund with other contributions to construct Peabody Hall which houses the Departments of Religion and Philosophy and the Institute of Native American Studies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=43}}</ref>\n\n=== South Campus ===\nLocated across Field Street from Central Campus to its north, South Campus is encircled by East Campus Road to its east, Pinecrest Drive to the south, and Lumpkin Street to the west. It is connected to the areas to its north by way of the Jim Gillis Bridge, named after the former director of the Georgia State Highway Board.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=82\u201383}}</ref> South Campus is the largest of the five segments of the UGA campus, latitudinally stretching for more than a mile. Originally begun as an expansion to accommodate the growing agricultural programs in an area known as \"Ag Hill\", it is home most of the university's science and engineer programs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=85}}</ref> In 2006, work was completed on D. W. Brooks Mall to give the campus a more green aesthetic similar to North Campus, replacing parking lots and a section of the street by the same name which bisected the area lengthwise.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=100\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Governor Wilson Lumpkin House, c. 1842, photographer facing NE.JPG|thumb|left|Lumpkin House on Cedar Street on the UGA campus]]\nLumpkin House, also known as \"Rock House\", is the oldest building on South Campus, built in 1844. The building is named after its original owner, [[Wilson Lumpkin]], the former Georgia congressman, governor, and U.S. Senator who designed and built the house as his retirement home. The building and the land surrounding it, on which the neighboring Connor Hall was built in 1908, was sold to the university by Lumpkin's youngest daughter who stipulated that ownership of the property would revert to her heirs if the university ever moved or destroyed the house. The house, used by the College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences (CAES), \"probably still stands only because of [this] odd clause\" which the university continues to honor. In 1970, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=101}}</ref> The second-oldest building, named after the state legislator James J. Conner, sits on one of the highest points in Athens. Built in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival style]], Conner Hall also serves the CAES. In 1975, it underwent an interior renovation that left the exterior features unchanged. Barrow Hall, built in 1911, is the third-oldest building in South Campus and serves a variety of academic programs. Originally known as the Farm Mechanics Building, the building was renamed after Chancellor David C. Barrow, during whose tenure it was constructed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=103}}</ref>\n\nHome to the College of Family and Consumer Sciences, Dawson Hall was built in 1932 to house the university's growing home economics department, then part of the College of Agriculture. The building is named after William Terrell Dawson, a Georgian physician and grandson of the namesake to Terrell Hall. In his will, Dawson donated $150,000 for the creation of a trust to benefit agricultural education at UGA. In 1971, the school added an annex to Dawson Hall and later renamed it after Mary Spiers who was dean of the School of Home Economics from 1954 to 1971.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=92}}</ref> The College of Family and Consumer Sciences also has five other buildings, built in 1939 and 1940, known collectively as the McPhaul Center.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=96\u201397}}</ref>\n\nOn the curved hill between Dawson Hall and Sanford Stadium, a plan envisioned in 1953, proposed the construction of a Science Center to house the university's various scientific programs. Between 1959 and 1960, six buildings were constructed to each house studies in Physics, Food Sciences, Geography\u2013Geology, Chemistry, Biological Sciences, and Poultry Science.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=90\u201392}}</ref> Located south of the Food Sciences Building, the Museum of Natural History manages several collections of artifacts and specimens from archaeology, biology, geology, and paleontology located throughout the buildings on campus.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=105\u2013106}}</ref> The Science Library was built south of Dawson Hall in 1968 to supplement the Science Center complex.

CURO operates on the premise that it is possible for undergraduate students and faculty members to cooperatively engage in the creation of knowledge. Research faculty members who participate in CURO consider students partners in a learning community, and many students find they develop mentoring relationships focused on conducting research. Participating in undergraduate research contributes to the intellectual, professional, and personal growth of UGA students. Through in-depth research with faculty members, students can explore questions and issues of interest as lines of inquiry develop through their undergraduate careers, earning academic credit in the process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.onlineathens.com/news/20180409/uga-undergraduates-display-their-research-in-curo-symposium|title=UGA undergraduates display their research in CURO Symposium|last=Shearer|first=Lee|date=April 9, 2018|website=Athens Banner-Herald|language=en|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.onlineathens.com/news/20181006/uga-recognizes-11-new-curo-honors-scholars|title=UGA recognizes 11 new CURO Honors Scholars|last=Schupska|first=Stephanie|date=October 6, 2018|website=Athens Banner-Herald|language=en|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Study abroad ===\n{{See also|UGA Costa Rica}}\nThe University of Georgia's Office of International Education offers numerous study abroad destinations for a wide array of majors and areas of study.

Many universities that are not land-grant have established ROTC programs such as the one at Harvard University. The University of Georgia ROTC is the official [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] training and commissioning program at the university. Prior to the 1862 Morrill Act, UGA founded its military program in 1801, and it is one of the oldest such programs in the nation. The UGA ROTC \"Bulldog Battalion\" (Army) and UGA AFROTC \"Flying Bulldogs\" (Air Force) offer commissions for the [[United States Army]] into active duty service, into the [[Army Reserves]] or the [[Army National Guard]], or into active service into the [[United States Air Force]]. The battalion is one of the oldest one continually operating in the United States.

The red color that is so evident in Georgia soils is due primarily to [[iron oxides]].\n\n=== The mascot ===\n[[File:UGA the University of Georgia mascot.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Uga (mascot)|Uga VI]], the official live mascot of the Georgia Bulldogs 1999\u20132008]]\nThe origin of the [[English Bulldog]] representing UGA came from [[Yale University]], with whom UGA had strong ties in its early years. Many early buildings and campus plans followed the layout of Yale.<ref>{{cite web|title=Georgia Traditions|url=http://www.georgiadogs.com/ot/geo-traditions.html|publisher=UGA's GeorgiaDogs.com|accessdate=February 9, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118124224/http://www.georgiadogs.com/ot/geo-traditions.html|archivedate=January 18, 2013}}</ref> The bulldog mascot stems from the University's founding father and first president, [[Abraham Baldwin]], who was a graduate of Yale. The Bulldogs were thought to be a tribute to Baldwin's alma mater. The term \"Georgia Bulldogs\" was first coined on November 3, 1920 by ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' writer Morgan Blake. After a 0\u20130 tie with the [[University of Virginia]] in Charlottesville on November 6, 1920, Atlanta Constitution writer Cliff Wheatley used the name \"Bulldogs\" in his story five times. The name caught on and has been used ever since.<ref name=\"Georgia Traditions\">{{cite web|title=Georgia Traditions|url=http://www.georgiadogs.com/ot/geo-traditions.html|publisher=UGA's Georgiadogs|accessdate=February 9, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118124224/http://www.georgiadogs.com/ot/geo-traditions.html|archivedate=January 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Uga (mascot)|Uga the Bulldog]] is the official live mascot of the [[Georgia Bulldogs]]. Uga is from a line owned by [[Sonny Seiler|Frank W. (Sonny) Seiler]] of [[Savannah, Georgia]] since 1956. The current line began with Uga I, a solid white English Bulldog who was the grandson of a former Georgia mascot who made the trip to the 1943 [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]]. Perhaps the most famous Uga was Uga V who made appearances in the movie ''[[Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil]].'' Uga V was also featured on the cover of the April 1997 edition of [[Sports Illustrated]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sports Illustrated cover page|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/cover/toc/9584/index.htm|publisher=SportsIllustrated|accessdate=February 9, 2013}}</ref> Uga X became the mascot in 2015.\n\nThe University of Georgia is the only major college that buries its mascots within the confines of its stadium.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Ugas I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII are buried in marble vaults near the main gate in the embankment of the south stands of Sanford Stadium.

The Chapel Bell is located on the historic North Campus. Built in 1832, when [[Protestantism|Protestant orthodoxy]] dominated the campus region, the Chapel was a center of campus activities. A daily religious service, which students were required to attend, were held there, as were assemblies and [[Commencement speech|commencements]]. The bell was also rung to mark the beginning and the end of class.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Chapel|url=http://chapel.myweb.uga.edu/history.html|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=February 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821212705/http://chapel.myweb.uga.edu/history.html|archive-date=August 21, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, the Chapel Bell has served as an athletic tradition at the University of Georgia. The ringing of the Chapel Bell after a Georgia victory is a tradition that has endured since the 1890s. In Georgia football's early days, [[Herty Field]] was located only yards from the chapel, and first-year students were compelled to ring the bell until midnight in celebration of a Bulldog victory. Today, students, alumni, fans and townspeople still rush to the Chapel to ring the bell after a victory.<ref name=\"Georgia Traditions\" /> The bell is also utilized for University meetings and events, weddings and remembrance ringing. The bell was rung in memory of victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. After the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, the University of Georgia partook in a nationwide mourning by ringing the Chapel Bell in honor of the victims of the shooting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bells will ring in Athens, across U.S., for Conn. shooting victims|url=http://onlineathens.com/uga/2012-12-19/bells-will-ring-athens-across-us-conn-shooting-victims|publisher=OnlineAthens|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn October 27, 2007, as tradition warrants, Georgia fans rang the Chapel Bell to celebrate the 42\u201330 win over the university's archrival, the [[Florida Gators]]. The excitement caused the yoke holding the 877&nbsp;lb. bell to give way, and it fell from the support platform. The university has returned the bell to its historic post and {{as of|2017|November|lc=y}}, it still rings daily across campus.\n\n=== Founders Week ===\n\nJanuary 27, 1785, is the date the University of Georgia became the first public university to have a charter granted. Each year, January 27 is commemorated to honor UGA's place in the [[History of education in the United States|history of American colleges and universities]]. The tradition began in 2002 and is now celebrated as Founders Week. During Founders Week, a series of celebrations are hosted by various campus departments including the Student Alumni Association and the Student Government Association.\n\nThe [[Emeriti]] Scholars, a group of retired faculty members especially known for their teaching abilities and continued involvement in the university's academic life, sponsor the Founders Day Lecture. The lecture is held in the UGA Chapel and has become a Founders Day tradition, drawing alumni, students, faculty, esteemed guests and members of the community.\n\n=== The Arch ===\n[[File:ArchUGA2.jpg|175px|thumb|left|180px|The Arch at the University of Georgia]]\n\nIn 1857, the University of Georgia constructed a cast iron representation of the architectural elements featured on the obverse of the Great Seal of the state of Georgia. It stands at the north entrance of the campus, and has become known as The Arch. Fashioned from existing material, The Arch is a representation but not an exact replica of the architectural elements of the Seal. Originally serving both symbolic and practical functions, it was connected to a barrier which kept cows from roaming over parts of the campus, and was initially known as The Gate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uga.edu/profile/arch/|title=The Arch|publisher=}}</ref> It serves as the official icon and a historic landmark for the university. Since the 1900s, tradition has held that students may not pass beneath the Arch until they have received a [[diploma]] from the University of Georgia. Those who walked under the Arch prior to [[Commencement ceremony|graduation commencement]] were said never to graduate. The tradition began when Daniel Huntley Redfearn, Class of 1910, arrived as a freshman from [[Boston, Georgia]] and vowed not to pass beneath the Arch until he had graduated. One of Redfearn's professors heard the vow and repeated it to his class, and the tradition has stood ever since. Many freshmen, learning of the tradition during orientation or from other sources still choose to honor the century-old tradition. Years of following the tradition are visible on the concrete steps leading to the Arch. Steps to each side have been worn down over the years as undergraduates have kept their vows.<ref>https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/the-arch-tradition-explained/article_9715edda-2ced-11e7-835a-433c10460414.html{{dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nThe Arch has been a site of historic [[Demonstration (people)|political demonstrations]]. In 1961, when UGA officials [[Desegregation|desegregated]] the university with the admission of its first two [[African-American]] students, [[Hamilton E. Holmes|Hamilton Holmes]] and [[Charlayne Hunter-Gault]]. The Arch was a witness to students protesting both for and against segregation in the protesting the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and a demonstration following the [[Kent State shootings|1970 shootings at Kent State University]]. In 2001, along with the Chapel Bell, the Arch was the site of a memorial to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\n=== The fight song and \"Alma Mater\" ===\n\"[[Glory, Glory (fight song)|Glory, Glory]]\" is the rally song for the [[Georgia Bulldogs]]. \"Glory, Glory\" is sung to the tune of \"[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\". It was sung at games as early as the 1890s, but arranged in its present form by musician-composer Hugh Hodgson in 1915. There have been many Bulldog songs through the years and at least two collections dating back to 1909 have been published, but \"Glory, Glory\" has been the most accepted among students and alumni. The only known original reference to the piece is in a history of the Redcoat Band written in 1962, which briefly mentions the march as \"Georgia's first original school song\" and notes that \"all copies of the work have been lost.\" The document is kept in the university's Hargrett Library for rare and historic documents.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glory, glory, old march discovered|url=http://uga.edu/gm/ee/index.php?/single/2008/09/172/|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=February 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518141302/http://uga.edu/gm/ee/index.php?%2Fsingle%2F2008%2F09%2F172%2F|archive-date=May 18, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlthough \"Glory, Glory\" is generally thought to be the school's fight song, the official fight song is \"Hail to Georgia\". The fight song is played by the [[Georgia Redcoat Marching Band]] after touchdowns, field goals, and extra points scored by the football team. The Georgia Redcoat Marching Band is a 375-member marching band. First directed in 1905 by R.E. Haughey, the band has only had seven directors.\n\nThe \"Alma Mater\", the official school song of the University of Georgia, is set to the tune of \"[[Annie Lisle]]\", a popular 1857 [[ballad]] by [[H. S. Thompson]]. The lyrics to \"Alma Mater\", penned by J.B. Wright, Jr., and Gail Carter Dendy, are unique to UGA. The song is sung at commencement and various official events of the University of Georgia.<ref>{{cite web|title=HISTORY & TRADITIONS \u2013 SINGING OF THE ALMA MATER|url=https://commencement.uga.edu/history|website=commencement.uga.edu|publisher=uga.edu|accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Playing \"Between the Hedges\" and Sanford Stadium ===\n[[Sanford Stadium]] is the on-campus playing venue for [[American football|football]] at the University of Georgia in Athens. The 92,746-seat stadium is the [[List of NCAA Division I FBS football stadiums|seventh largest stadium]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] and has a grass (versus synthetic) field. The stadium is the 8th largest non-racing stadium in the United States and the 14th largest such stadium in the world.

The famous Chinese privet hedges that surround Sanford's playing field were only one foot high when the stadium was dedicated in 1929 and were protected by a wooden fence. Sports writers, referring to an upcoming home game, were said to observe \"that the Bulldogs will have their opponent \"between the hedges.\" The phrase was coined by the Atlanta sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Georgia Traditions|url=http://www.georgiadogs.com/ot/geo-traditions.html|publisher=Georgia Dogs|accessdate=December 2, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118124224/http://www.georgiadogs.com/ot/geo-traditions.html|archivedate=January 18, 2013}}</ref> Games played there are said to be played \"Between the Hedges\" due to the [[privet]] hedges, which had stood around the field since 1929, but removed in the summer of 1996 so that soccer could be played for the 1996 Summer Olympics; new, albeit considerably shorter, hedges were restored in the fall of 1996.

After traveling the state to recruit a few students, Meigs opened the school with no building in the fall of 1801. The first school building patterned after Yale's [[Connecticut Hall]] was built the year later.

In 1872, the $243,000 federal allotment to Georgia was invested to create a $16,000 annual income used to establish the Georgia State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (A&M), initially separate and independent from the University of Georgia. However, A&M's funding was considered part of the university, which helped save it from bankruptcy during the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\":4\" /> As a land-grant school, UGA was required to provide military training, which the university began to offer in the 1870s.<ref name=\":5\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=5}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of the university's extracurricular organizations began in the late 1800s. In 1886, fraternities at UGA began publishing the school's yearbook, the ''Pandora''. The same year, the university gained its first intercollegiate sport when a baseball team was formed, followed by a football team formed in 1892. Both teams played in a small field west of campus now known as [[Herty Field]]. The Demosthenian and [[Phi Kappa Literary Society|Phi Kappa]] literary societies together formed the student paper, ''[[The Red & Black (University of Georgia)|The Red & Black]]'', in 1883.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 1894, the University of Georgia joined six other southeastern schools to form the [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (SIAA).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyqWE2wlYJ4C|title=How the SEC Became Goliath: The Making of College Football's Most Dominant Conference|last=Glier|first=Ray|date=September 25, 2012|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4767-0328-2|pages=23|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|20th century}}<!-- Anchor for redirects of [college] articles; caution. -->\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[File:Mary Ethel Creswell graduation photo 1919.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Mary Ethel Creswell]], in 1919, the first woman to earn an undergraduate degree at the university]]\nThe turn of the century brought many changes in the administration and organization of the university including the naming of a new chancellor in 1899. [[Walter Barnard Hill|Walter B. Hill]] became the first UGA alumnus to lead the university. A progressive and enlightened leader, his six-year tenure, before his death from pneumonia, was marked with increased enrollment, expansion of the university's course offerings, and the addition of state funding through appropriation, for the first time bringing the university's annual income to over $100,000 in 1902. Hill and his successors [[David Crenshaw Barrow Jr.|David C. Barrow]] (1906\u20131925), [[Charles Mercer Snelling|Charles Snelling]] (1926\u20131932), and [[Steadman Vincent Sanford|Steadman Sanford]] (1932\u20131935) would grow the school to take on the role of a true university.<ref name=\":5\" /> Many of the university's schools and colleges were established during Barrow's tenure. The College of Education (1908), the [[University of Georgia Graduate School|Graduate School]] (1910), the [[Terry College of Business|School of Commerce]] (1912), the [[Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication|School of Journalism]] (1915), and the [[University of Georgia College of Family and Consumer Sciences|Division of Home Economics]] (1918) were all established during this period. In 1906, UGA also incorporated the [[University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences|College of Agriculture]] by bringing together A&M (agricultural and mechanical) courses. The college of science and engineering continued as formed in the previous century. Connor Hall became the first building built in South Campus and first of several buildings that housed the university's agriculture programs on what came to be known as \"Ag Hill\". In 1914, the first [[Phi Beta Kappa]] chapter in the state of Georgia was founded at UGA.<ref name=\":6\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=6}}</ref> In 1923, another honor society, [[Phi Kappa Phi]], established a chapter at the university.<ref>{{Harvnb|Boney|2000|p=113}}</ref> In 1920, UGA's athletic program was among 14 of the 30 universities to leave the SIAA to form the [[Southern Conference]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cm1TZA6jCSgC|title=SEC Football: 75 Years of Pride and Passion|last=Scott|first=Richard|date=September 15, 2008|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-1-61673-133-5|pages=16|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWith students limited to white males for the first century of its history, the University of Georgia began admitting white female students during the summer of 1903 as postgraduate students to the [[State Normal School (Athens, Georgia)|State Normal School]] established in 1893 a few miles west of the campus. When the University of Georgia established a graduate school in 1910, female students were permitted to attend summer classes and some were also unofficially allowed to attend regular classes, as well.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=6\u20137}}</ref> However, at that time only junior college transfers majoring in Home Economics were integrated into regular courses.<ref name=\":6\" /> Before official admission of women to the university, several women were able to complete graduate degrees through credit earned during the summer sessions.

The State Normal School (later State Teachers College) was fully absorbed by the College of Education, with the former's previous campus becoming UGA's Coordinate Campus. UGA and [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] traded several school programs; all engineering programs (except agriculture) were transferred to Georgia Tech and UGA received Georgia Tech's commerce program in return. The title of the university's lead administrator was changed from chancellor back to the original title of president. Sanford was named UGA's first president since 1860<ref name=\":8\" /> and was succeeded by [[Harmon White Caldwell|Harmon Caldwell]] (1935\u20131948). In 1933, the Division of Home Economics was reorganized as the [[University of Georgia College of Family and Consumer Sciences|School of Home of Economics]],<ref name=\":10\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=9}}</ref> with UGA's first female graduate, Creswell, appointed as dean.<ref name=\":9\" /> The university also became a founding member of the [[Southeastern Conference]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJUIUzD4joAC|title=Games Colleges Play: Scandal and Reform in Intercollegiate Athletics|last=Thelin|first=John R.|date=June 1, 2011|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-1-4214-0391-5|at=Chapter 2|language=en}}</ref> and established the [[University of Georgia Press]] in 1938.<ref name=\":11\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=11}}</ref><ref name=\":12\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=45}}</ref>\n\nThroughout this period, UGA's enrollment grew every year with student population reaching 3,000 by 1937 and almost 4,000 by 1941. Through President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], UGA received a $2 million infusion of funding and an additional $1 million from the state legislature. The university used the new funds to make a number of improvements to the campus from 1936 to the early 1940s. Many renovation projects were undertaken including the establishment of five new residence halls, a dining hall, eight new academic buildings, a nursery school, and several auxiliary facilities. An engineering professor Rudolph Driftmier and architect Roy Hitchcock were responsible for the design of several buildings in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]], giving the campus a homogeneous and distinctive appearance. The funds were also used to pave roads, build sidewalks, and improve the campus's landscaping.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Racial integration and the mid-20th century ===\nThe dean of the College of Education in 1941, [[Walter Cocking]], was fired by Georgia Governor [[Eugene Talmadge]] in a controversial decision known as the [[Cocking affair]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cook|first=James F|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-594|title=Cocking Affair|encyclopedia=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Georgia Humanities Council and University of Georgia Press|year=2002|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> Talmadge was motivated by his belief that Cocking favored racial integration. The governor's interference in the workings of USG's Board of Regents prompted a response by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools|Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]], which stripped UGA and nine other schools in the system of their accreditation. The issue became a major point of contention in Talmadge's 1942 re-election campaign. After his loss, a constitutional amendment passed by the state legislature gave the Board of Regents independence from political interference, which led to the schools quickly regaining their accreditation.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nAs the United States entered [[World War II]], enrollment among male students dropped significantly, allowing female students to outnumber male students for the first time in the school's history. In 1945, UGA accepted a donation of about 100 paintings from the New York art collector Alfred Holbrook and created the [[Georgia Museum of Art]]. In 1946, the [[University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine|School of Veterinary Medicine]] was re-established as a separate school, 13 years after it was discontinued as part of the agricultural college.<ref name=\":11\" /> The following year, the quarterly literary journal ''[[The Georgia Review]]'' began publication.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> After [[Jonathan Clark Rogers|Jonathan Rogers]]' brief tenure as president (1949\u20131950),<ref name=\":8\" /> [[Omer Clyde Aderhold]] started his 17-year-long stint as UGA president. During his tenure, the university sold Coordinate Campus to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]. He opened the school's main library, the Ilah Dunlap-Little Memorial Library, in 1952, and in 1964, established the [[University of Georgia School of Social Work|School of Social Work]].<ref name=\":11\" /> The university also built a new Science Center on South Campus consisting of six buildings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> After UGA's pharmacy school moved to the new facility on the South Campus, the two portions of the campus took on distinct characteristics, with North Campus focused on arts, humanities, and law, and South Campus focused on natural sciences and agricultural programs.<ref name=\":13\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Holmes-Hunter Academic Building (3), UGA.JPG|275px|thumb|left|Entrance to the Holmes-Hunter Academic Building]]\nUGA was racially integrated in 1961, with the admission of [[Hamilton E.

On January 9, 1961, three days after a court decision granting them admission, Holmes and Hunter \"walked through the Arch and into the Academic Building\" to register for classes. On the 40th anniversary of the event, the university renamed the very same prominent campus building where they registered as the Holmes-Hunter Academic Building, and the university now presents the Holmes-Hunter Lectures series, which brings noted African-American speakers to the campus each year to discuss racial issues.<ref name=\"jqstQ\">{{cite web|last1=Van Gelder|first1=Lawrence|title=Hamilton E.

The building is named after its original owner, [[Wilson Lumpkin]], the former Georgia congressman, governor, and U.S. Senator who designed and built the house as his retirement home. The building and the land surrounding it, on which the neighboring Connor Hall was built in 1908, was sold to the university by Lumpkin's youngest daughter who stipulated that ownership of the property would revert to her heirs if the university ever moved or destroyed the house. The house, used by the College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences (CAES), \"probably still stands only because of [this] odd clause\" which the university continues to honor. In 1970, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=101}}</ref> The second-oldest building, named after the state legislator James J. Conner, sits on one of the highest points in Athens. Built in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival style]], Conner Hall also serves the CAES. In 1975, it underwent an interior renovation that left the exterior features unchanged. Barrow Hall, built in 1911, is the third-oldest building in South Campus and serves a variety of academic programs. Originally known as the Farm Mechanics Building, the building was renamed after Chancellor David C. Barrow, during whose tenure it was constructed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=103}}</ref>\n\nHome to the College of Family and Consumer Sciences, Dawson Hall was built in 1932 to house the university's growing home economics department, then part of the College of Agriculture. The building is named after William Terrell Dawson, a Georgian physician and grandson of the namesake to Terrell Hall. In his will, Dawson donated $150,000 for the creation of a trust to benefit agricultural education at UGA. In 1971, the school added an annex to Dawson Hall and later renamed it after Mary Spiers who was dean of the School of Home Economics from 1954 to 1971.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=92}}</ref> The College of Family and Consumer Sciences also has five other buildings, built in 1939 and 1940, known collectively as the McPhaul Center.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=96\u201397}}</ref>\n\nOn the curved hill between Dawson Hall and Sanford Stadium, a plan envisioned in 1953, proposed the construction of a Science Center to house the university's various scientific programs.

Georgia students and alumni declared yellow an unfit color for the [[Georgia Bulldogs]], deeming it a cowardly color. After the [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate#Establishment|1893 football game against Georgia Tech]], University of Georgia President, Dr. [[Charles Herty]], removed old gold as an official school color. [[Crimson]] (also referred to as \"Good Old Georgia Red\") and black have been the official colors ever since.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origins of SEC School Colors|url=http://www.secsportsfan.com/origins-of-sec-school-colors.html|publisher=SEC Sports Fan|accessdate=February 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to include crimson red is also thought to be a tribute to the state of Georgia and a reminder of the University's flagship status. [[Kaolinite]], commonly referred to as \"Georgia red clay\" is commonly found throughout the state, especially in the [[Red Hills Region]]. The red color that is so evident in Georgia soils is due primarily to [[iron oxides]].\n\n=== The mascot ===\n[[File:UGA the University of Georgia mascot.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Uga (mascot)|Uga VI]], the official live mascot of the Georgia Bulldogs 1999\u20132008]]\nThe origin of the [[English Bulldog]] representing UGA came from [[Yale University]], with whom UGA had strong ties in its early years.

After a 0\u20130 tie with the [[University of Virginia]] in Charlottesville on November 6, 1920, Atlanta Constitution writer Cliff Wheatley used the name \"Bulldogs\" in his story five times.

The current line began with Uga I, a solid white English Bulldog who was the grandson of a former Georgia mascot who made the trip to the 1943 [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]]. Perhaps the most famous Uga was Uga V who made appearances in the movie ''[[Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil]].'' Uga V was also featured on the cover of the April 1997 edition of [[Sports Illustrated]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sports Illustrated cover page|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/cover/toc/9584/index.htm|publisher=SportsIllustrated|accessdate=February 9, 2013}}</ref> Uga X became the mascot in 2015.\n\nThe University of Georgia is the only major college that buries its mascots within the confines of its stadium.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Ugas I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII are buried in marble vaults near the main gate in the embankment of the south stands of Sanford Stadium.

The Chapel Bell is located on the historic North Campus. Built in 1832, when [[Protestantism|Protestant orthodoxy]] dominated the campus region, the Chapel was a center of campus activities. A daily religious service, which students were required to attend, were held there, as were assemblies and [[Commencement speech|commencements]]. The bell was also rung to mark the beginning and the end of class.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Chapel|url=http://chapel.myweb.uga.edu/history.html|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=February 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821212705/http://chapel.myweb.uga.edu/history.html|archive-date=August 21, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, the Chapel Bell has served as an athletic tradition at the University of Georgia. The ringing of the Chapel Bell after a Georgia victory is a tradition that has endured since the 1890s. In Georgia football's early days, [[Herty Field]] was located only yards from the chapel, and first-year students were compelled to ring the bell until midnight in celebration of a Bulldog victory. Today, students, alumni, fans and townspeople still rush to the Chapel to ring the bell after a victory.<ref name=\"Georgia Traditions\" /> The bell is also utilized for University meetings and events, weddings and remembrance ringing. The bell was rung in memory of victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. After the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, the University of Georgia partook in a nationwide mourning by ringing the Chapel Bell in honor of the victims of the shooting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bells will ring in Athens, across U.S., for Conn. shooting victims|url=http://onlineathens.com/uga/2012-12-19/bells-will-ring-athens-across-us-conn-shooting-victims|publisher=OnlineAthens|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn October 27, 2007, as tradition warrants, Georgia fans rang the Chapel Bell to celebrate the 42\u201330 win over the university's archrival, the [[Florida Gators]]. The excitement caused the yoke holding the 877&nbsp;lb. bell to give way, and it fell from the support platform. The university has returned the bell to its historic post and {{as of|2017|November|lc=y}}, it still rings daily across campus.\n\n=== Founders Week ===\n\nJanuary 27, 1785, is the date the University of Georgia became the first public university to have a charter granted. Each year, January 27 is commemorated to honor UGA's place in the [[History of education in the United States|history of American colleges and universities]]. The tradition began in 2002 and is now celebrated as Founders Week. During Founders Week, a series of celebrations are hosted by various campus departments including the Student Alumni Association and the Student Government Association.\n\nThe [[Emeriti]] Scholars, a group of retired faculty members especially known for their teaching abilities and continued involvement in the university's academic life, sponsor the Founders Day Lecture. The lecture is held in the UGA Chapel and has become a Founders Day tradition, drawing alumni, students, faculty, esteemed guests and members of the community.\n\n=== The Arch ===\n[[File:ArchUGA2.jpg|175px|thumb|left|180px|The Arch at the University of Georgia]]\n\nIn 1857, the University of Georgia constructed a cast iron representation of the architectural elements featured on the obverse of the Great Seal of the state of Georgia. It stands at the north entrance of the campus, and has become known as The Arch. Fashioned from existing material, The Arch is a representation but not an exact replica of the architectural elements of the Seal. Originally serving both symbolic and practical functions, it was connected to a barrier which kept cows from roaming over parts of the campus, and was initially known as The Gate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uga.edu/profile/arch/|title=The Arch|publisher=}}</ref> It serves as the official icon and a historic landmark for the university. Since the 1900s, tradition has held that students may not pass beneath the Arch until they have received a [[diploma]] from the University of Georgia. Those who walked under the Arch prior to [[Commencement ceremony|graduation commencement]] were said never to graduate. The tradition began when Daniel Huntley Redfearn, Class of 1910, arrived as a freshman from [[Boston, Georgia]] and vowed not to pass beneath the Arch until he had graduated. One of Redfearn's professors heard the vow and repeated it to his class, and the tradition has stood ever since. Many freshmen, learning of the tradition during orientation or from other sources still choose to honor the century-old tradition. Years of following the tradition are visible on the concrete steps leading to the Arch. Steps to each side have been worn down over the years as undergraduates have kept their vows.<ref>https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/the-arch-tradition-explained/article_9715edda-2ced-11e7-835a-433c10460414.html{{dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nThe Arch has been a site of historic [[Demonstration (people)|political demonstrations]]. In 1961, when UGA officials [[Desegregation|desegregated]] the university with the admission of its first two [[African-American]] students, [[Hamilton E. Holmes|Hamilton Holmes]] and [[Charlayne Hunter-Gault]]. The Arch was a witness to students protesting both for and against segregation in the protesting the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and a demonstration following the [[Kent State shootings|1970 shootings at Kent State University]]. In 2001, along with the Chapel Bell, the Arch was the site of a memorial to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\n=== The fight song and \"Alma Mater\" ===\n\"[[Glory, Glory (fight song)|Glory, Glory]]\" is the rally song for the [[Georgia Bulldogs]]. \"Glory, Glory\" is sung to the tune of \"[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\". It was sung at games as early as the 1890s, but arranged in its present form by musician-composer Hugh Hodgson in 1915. There have been many Bulldog songs through the years and at least two collections dating back to 1909 have been published, but \"Glory, Glory\" has been the most accepted among students and alumni. The only known original reference to the piece is in a history of the Redcoat Band written in 1962, which briefly mentions the march as \"Georgia's first original school song\" and notes that \"all copies of the work have been lost.\" The document is kept in the university's Hargrett Library for rare and historic documents.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glory, glory, old march discovered|url=http://uga.edu/gm/ee/index.php?/single/2008/09/172/|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=February 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518141302/http://uga.edu/gm/ee/index.php?%2Fsingle%2F2008%2F09%2F172%2F|archive-date=May 18, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlthough \"Glory, Glory\" is generally thought to be the school's fight song, the official fight song is \"Hail to Georgia\". The fight song is played by the [[Georgia Redcoat Marching Band]] after touchdowns, field goals, and extra points scored by the football team. The Georgia Redcoat Marching Band is a 375-member marching band. First directed in 1905 by R.E. Haughey, the band has only had seven directors.\n\nThe \"Alma Mater\", the official school song of the University of Georgia, is set to the tune of \"[[Annie Lisle]]\", a popular 1857 [[ballad]] by [[H. S. Thompson]]. The lyrics to \"Alma Mater\", penned by J.B. Wright, Jr., and Gail Carter Dendy, are unique to UGA. The song is sung at commencement and various official events of the University of Georgia.<ref>{{cite web|title=HISTORY & TRADITIONS \u2013 SINGING OF THE ALMA MATER|url=https://commencement.uga.edu/history|website=commencement.uga.edu|publisher=uga.edu|accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Playing \"Between the Hedges\" and Sanford Stadium ===\n[[Sanford Stadium]] is the on-campus playing venue for [[American football|football]] at the University of Georgia in Athens. The 92,746-seat stadium is the [[List of NCAA Division I FBS football stadiums|seventh largest stadium]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] and has a grass (versus synthetic) field. The stadium is the 8th largest non-racing stadium in the United States and the 14th largest such stadium in the world.
