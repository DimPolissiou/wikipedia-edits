Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy.

{"title_page": "Kingdom of Alba", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\nThe '''Kingdom of Alba''' refers to the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] between the deaths of [[Donald II of Scotland|Donald II]] (Domnall mac Causantin) in 900 and of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] in 1286, which then led indirectly to the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]]. The name is one of convenience, as throughout this period the elite and populace of the Kingdom were predominantly Pictish-Gaels or later Pictish-Gaels and [[Scoto-Norman]], and differs markedly from the period of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]], in which the elite of the kingdom were (for the most part) speakers of [[Middle English]], which later evolved and came to be called [[History of the Scots language|Lowland Scots]]. There is no precise Gaelic equivalent for the English terminology \"Kingdom of Alba\", as the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] term ''R\u00ecoghachd na h-Alba'' means 'Kingdom of Scotland'.  English-speaking scholars adapted the Gaelic name for Scotland to apply to a particular political period in Scottish history during the [[High Middle Ages]].\n\n==Royal court==\nLittle is known about the structure of the Scottish [[royal court]] in the period before the coming of the Normans to Scotland, before the reign of David I. A little more is known about the court of the later 12th and 13th centuries. In the words of Geoffrey Barrow, this court \"was emphatically feudal, Frankish, non-Celtic in character\".<ref name=\"barcourtcitation\">Barrow, ''Robert Bruce'', (1998), p. 7.</ref> Some of the offices were [[Gael]]ic in origin, such as the ''[[Hostarius (Scotland)|Hostarius]]'' (later Usher or \"Doorward\"), the man in charge of the royal bodyguard, and the ''rannaire'', the [[Scots Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking member of the court whose job was to divide the food.<ref name=\"rannairecitation\">Barrow, ''Kingship and Unity'', p. 34.</ref>\n\n*The '''[[Seneschal]]''' or ''dapifer'' (i.e. the [[Butler|Steward]]), had been hereditary since the reign of David I. The Steward had responsibility for the royal household and its management. (see [[High Steward of Scotland]]).\n*The '''[[Chancellor]]''' was in charge of the royal chapel. The latter was the king's place of worship, but as it happened, was associated with the royal [[scribes]], responsible for keeping records. Usually, the chancellor was a clergyman, and usually he held this office before being promoted to a bishopric (see [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland]]).\n*The '''[[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]]''' had control and responsibility over royal finances (see [[Chamberlain of Scotland]])\n*The '''[[Constable]]''' was also hereditary since the reign of David I and was in charge of the crown's military resources (see [[Lord High Constable of Scotland]]).\n*The '''[[Butler]]''' (see [[Butler of Scotland]])\n*The '''[[Marshal]]''' or ''marischal''. The marischal differed from the constable in that he was more specialised, responsible for and in charge of the royal cavalry forces (see [[Earl Marischal]])\n\nIn the 13th century, all the other offices tended to be hereditary, with the exception of the Chancellor. The royal household of course came with numerous other offices. The most important was probably the aforementioned ''hostarius'', but there were others such as the royal hunters, the royal foresters and the cooks (''dispensa'' or ''spence'').\n\n==Kings of Alba==\n{{further|Origins of the Kingdom of Alba|List of Scottish monarchs}}\n\n===Donald II and Constantine II===\nKing [[Donald II of Scotland|Donald II]] was the first man to have been called ''r\u00ed Alban'' (i.e. ''King of Alba''), when he died at [[Dunnotar Castle|Dunnottar]] in 900.<ref name=\"albacitation\">[[Annals of Ulster|AU]], s.a. 900; A.O. Anderson, ''Early Sources'', vol. i, p. 395</ref> This meant king of [[Caledonia]] or Scotland. All his predecessors bore the style of either ''King of the [[Picts]]'' or ''King of [[Fortriu]]''. Such an apparent innovation in the Gaelic chronicles is occasionally taken to spell the birth of Scotland, but there is nothing special about his reign that might confirm this. Donald had the nickname ''d\u00e1sachtach''. This simply meant a madman, or in early Irish law, a man not in control of his functions and hence without legal culpability.<ref name=\"kelly1citation\">Kelly, ''Early Irish Law'', (1998), p.92.</ref> The reason was possibly the restlessness of his reign, continually spent fighting battles against [[Vikings]]. It is possible he gained his unpopularity by violating the rights of the church or through high taxes, but it is not known for certain. However, his extremely negative nickname makes him an unlikely founder of Scotland.\n\nDonald's successor [[Constantine II of Scotland|Constantine II]] (Causant\u00edn mac Aeda) is more often regarded as a key figure in the formation of Alba.<ref name=\"isos1citation\">e.g. [[BBC]] documentary ''In Search of Scotland'', ep. 2.</ref> Constantine reigned for nearly half a century, fighting many battles. When he lost at [[Brunanburh]], he was clearly discredited and retired as a [[Culdee]] monk at St. Andrews. Despite this, the [[Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n]] is full of praise for the king, and in this respect is in line with the views of other sources. Constantine is credited in later tradition as the man who, with bishop Ceallach of St Andrews, brought the [[Catholic Church]] in Scotland into conformity with that of the larger [[Gael]]ic world, although it is not known exactly what this means. There had been Gaelic bishops in St Andrews for two centuries, and Gaelic churchmen were amongst the oldest features of Caledonian Christianity. The reform may have been organizational, or some sort of purge of certain unknown and perhaps disliked legacies of Pictish ecclesiastical tradition. However, other than these factors, it is difficult to appreciate fully the importance of Constantine's reign.\n\n===Malcolm I to Malcolm II===\nThe period between the accession of [[Malcolm I of Scotland|Malcolm I]] (Maol Caluim Mac Domhnuill) and [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]] (Maol Caluim Mac Cionaodha) is marked by good relations with the [[Wessex]] [[Kings of England|rulers of England]], intense internal dynastic disunity and, despite this, relatively successful expansionary policies. Some time after an English invasion of ''cumbra land'' ([[Old English language|Old English]] for either [[Strathclyde]] or [[Cumbria]] or both) by King Edmund of England in 945, the English king handed the province over to king Malcolm I on condition of a permanent alliance. Some time in the reign of King [[Indulf of Scotland|Indulf]] (Idulb mac Causant\u00edn) (954\u201362), the Scots captured the fortress called ''oppidum Eden'', i.e. almost certainly [[Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"hud1citation\">Hudson, ''Celtic Kings'', (1994), p. 89</ref> It was the first Scottish foothold in [[Lothian]]. The Scots had probably had some authority in Strathclyde since the later part of the 9th century, but the kingdom kept its own rulers, and it is not clear that the Scots were always strong enough to enforce their authority. In fact, one of Indulf's successors, [[Culen of Scotland|Cuil\u00e9n]] (Cuil\u00e9n mac Ilduilbh), died at the hands of the men of Strathclyde, perhaps while trying to enforce his authority. King [[Kenneth II of Scotland|Kenneth II]] (Cionaodh Mac Maol Chaluim) (971\u201395) began his reign by invading ''Britannia'' (possibly Strathclyde), perhaps as an early assertion of his authority, and perhaps also as a traditional Gaelic ''crechr\u00edghe'' (lit. \"royal prey\"), the rite by which a king secured the success of his reign with an inauguration raid in the territory of a historical enemy.<ref name=\"hud2citation\">Hudson, ''Celtic Kings'', (1994), pp. 95\u20136</ref>\n\nThe reign of Malcolm I (942/3\u2013954) also marks the first known tensions between the Scottish kingdom and [[Mormaer of Moray|Moray]], the old heartland of the Scoto-Pictish kingdom of [[Fortriu]]. The ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' reported that King Malcolm \"went into Moray and slew Ceallach.\" The same source tells us that King Malcolm was killed by the Moravians.<ref name=\"cellachcitation\">A.O. Anderson, ''Early Sources'', vol. i, p. 452.</ref> This is the first definite sign of tension between the ''[[Cen\u00e9l nGabr\u00e1in]]'' and ''[[Cen\u00e9l Loairn]]'', two kin-groups claiming descent from different ancestors of [[Erc of Dalriada|Erc]]. During the reign of [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] (Mac Beathadh Mac Findl\u00e1ich), and his successor [[Lulach of Scotland|Lulach]] (Lulach Mac Gille Comhgh\u00e1in), the Moray-based ''Cen\u00e9l Loairn'' ruled all Scotland.\n\nThe reign of Malcolm II saw the final incorporation of these territories. The critical year perhaps was 1018, when King Malcolm II defeated the Northumbrians at the [[Battle of Carham]]. In the same year, King [[Owain Foel]] died, leaving his kingdom to his overlord Malcolm. A meeting with King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] of Denmark and England, probably about 1031, seems to have further secured these conquests, although the exact nature of Scottish rule over the Lothian and [[Scottish Borders]] area was not fully realised until the conquest and annexation of that province during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence|Wars of Independence]].\n\n===Duncan I to Alexander I===\n[[File:Coronation Chair and Stone of Scone. Anonymous Engraver. Published in A History of England (1855).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Stone of Scone]] in the Coronation Chair at [[Westminster Abbey]], 1855. It was the ceremonial coronation stone of Scotland's Gaelic kings, similar to the Irish [[Lia F\u00e1il]].]]\n\nThe period between the accession of King [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan I]] (Donnchadh Mac Cr\u00edon\u00e1in) (1034) and the death of [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] (1124) was the last before the coming of the [[Normans]] to Scotland. In some respects, the reign of King [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]] (Maol Caluim Mac Donnchaidh) prefigured the changes which took place in the reigns of the French-speaking kings [[David I of Scotland|David I]] and [[William I of Scotland|William I]], although native reaction to the manner of [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]]'s (Donnchad mac M\u00e1el Coluim) accession perhaps put these changes back somewhat.\n\nKing Duncan I's reign was a military failure. He was defeated by the native English at [[Durham, England|Durham]] in 1040, and was subsequently toppled.  Duncan had only been related to previous rulers through his mother [[Bethoc]], daughter of Malcolm II, who had married [[Abbot Crinan|Cr\u00edn\u00e1n]], the lay abbot of [[Dunkeld]] (and probably [[Mormaer of Atholl]] too). At a location called ''Bothganowan'' (or ''Bothgowan'', ''Bothgofnane'', ''Bothgofuane'', meaning \"Blacksmith's Hut\" in old Gaelic,<ref>[http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/historical_sources_of_macbeth.html Historical Sources of Macbeth.]</ref> today ''Pitgaveny'' near [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]]), the [[Mormaer of Moray]], [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] defeated and killed Duncan, and took the kingship for himself.<ref name=\"hud3citation\">Hudson, ''Celtic Kings'', p. 124.</ref> After Macbeth's successor Lulach, another Moravian, all kings of Scotland were Duncan's descendants. For this reason, Duncan's reign is often remembered positively, while Macbeth is villanised. Eventually, [[William Shakespeare]] gave fame to this medieval equivalent of propaganda by further immortalising both men in his play [[Macbeth]]. Macbeth's reign however was successful enough that he had the security to go on [[pilgrimage]] to Rome.\n\nIt was Malcolm III who acquired the nickname (as did his successors) \"Canmore\" (''Ceann M\u00f3r'', \"Great Chief\"), and not his father Duncan, who did more to create the successful dynasty which ruled Scotland for the following two centuries. Part of the success was the huge number of children he had. Through two marriages, firstly to the Norwegian [[Ingibiorg Finnsdottir]], and secondly to the English princess [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret of Wessex]], Malcolm had perhaps a [[dozen]] children. Malcolm and, if we believe later hagiography, his wife, introduced the first [[Benedictine]] monks to Scotland. However, despite having a royal [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] wife, Malcolm spent more of his reign conducting slave raids against the English, adding to the woes of that people in the aftermath of the [[Norman Conquest of England]] and the [[Harrying of the North]], as [[Marianus Scotus]] tells us:\n\n<blockquote>the Scots and French devastated the English; and [the English] were dispersed and died of hunger; and were compelled to eat human flesh: and to this end, to kill men, and to salt and dry them''.\u201d<ref name=\"marianuscitation\">A.O. Anderson, ''Early Sources'', vol. ii, p. 23, & n. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMalcolm died in one of these raids, in 1093. In the aftermath of his death, the Norman rulers of England began their interference in the Scottish kingdom. This interference was prompted by Malcolm's raids and attempts to forge claims for his successors to the English kingship. He had married the sister of the native English claimant to the English throne, [[Edgar \u00c6theling]], and had given most of his children by this marriage Anglo-Saxon royal names. Moreover, he had given support to many native English nobles, including Edgar himself, and had been supporting native English insurrections against their Norman rulers. In 1080, King [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] sent his son on an invasion of Scotland. The invasion got as far as [[Falkirk]], on the boundary between Scotland-proper and Lothian, and Malcolm submitted to the authority of the king, giving his oldest son Duncan as a hostage. This submission perhaps gives the reason why Malcolm did not give his last two sons, Alexander and David, Anglo-Saxon royal names.\n\nMalcolm's natural successor was his brother, [[Donald III of Scotland|Donalbane]] (Domhnall B\u00e1n Mac Donnchaidh), as Malcolm's sons were young. However, the Norman state to the south sent Malcolm's son Duncan to take the kingship. In the ensuing conflict, the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' tells us that:\n\n<blockquote>Donnchadh went to Scotland with what aid he could get of the English and French, and deprived his kinsman Domhnall of the Kingdom, and was received as King. But afterwards some of the Scots gathered themselves together, and slew almost all of his followers; and he himself escaped with few. Thereafter they were reconciled on the condition that he should never again introduce English or French into the land''\u201d{{NoteTag|Normanists tend to sideline or downplay opposition amongst the native Scots to Canmore authority, but much work has been done on the topic recently, especially R. Andrew McDonald, ''Outlaws of Medieval Scotland: Challenges to the Canmore Kings, 1058&ndash;1266'', (East Linton, 2003).}}</blockquote>\n\nDuncan was killed the same year, 1094, and Donalbane resumed sole kingship. However, the Norman state sent another of Malcolm's sons, [[Edgar of Scotland|Edgar]] to take the kingship. Anglo-Norman policy worked, because thereafter all kings of Scotland succeeded, not without opposition of course, under a system very closely corresponding with the [[primogeniture]] that operated in the French-speaking world. The reigns of both Edgar and his brother and successor Alexander are comparatively obscure. The former's most notable act was to send a [[camel]] (or perhaps an elephant) to his fellow Gael [[Muircheartach Ua Briain|Muirchertach Ua Briain]], [[High King of Ireland]].<ref name=\"camelcitation\">[[Annals of Inisfallen]], s.a. 1105&ndash;[[1107/7]], available [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100004 here];</ref> When Edgar died, Alexander took the kingship, while his youngest brother David became Prince of \"Cumbria\" and ruler of Lothian.\n\n===Norman Kings: David I to Alexander III===\n[[File:BookDeerLukeFol029v.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Book of Deer]]'', folio 29v contains a portrait of the [[Luke the Evangelist|Evangelist Luke]]; a list of privileges and legends were written in Gaelic and Latin in the margins, in lowland [[Mormaer of Buchan|Buchan]] in the reign of David I.]]\nThe period between the accession of David I and the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] was marked by dependence upon, and relatively good relations with, the Kings of the English. It was also a period of historical expansion for the Scottish kingdom, and witnessed the successful imposition of royal authority across most of the modern country. The period was one of a great deal of historical change, and much of the modern historiographical literature is devoted to this change (especially G.W.S. Barrow), part of a more general phenomenon which has been called the \"Europeanisation of Europe\".<ref name=\"bartlettcitation\">Bartlett, ''The Making of Europe'' (1993).</ref> More recent works though, while acknowledging that a great deal of change did take place, emphasise that this period was in fact also one of great continuity (e.g. Cynthia Neville, Richard Oram, Dauvit Broun, and others). Indeed, the period is subject to many misconceptions. For instance, English did not spread all over the Lowlands (see language section), and neither did English names; and, moreover even by 1300, most native lordships remained in native Gaelic hands, with only a minority passing to men of French or Anglo-French origin; furthermore, the Normanisation and imposition of royal authority in Scotland was not a peaceful process, but in fact cumulatively more violent than the Norman Conquest of England; additionally, the Scottish kings were not independent monarchs, but vassals to the King of the English, although not \"legally\" for Scotland north of the Forth.\n\nThe important changes which did occur include the extensive establishment of [[burgh]]s (see section), in many respects Scotland's first urban institutions; the [[Feudalism|feudalisation]], or more accurately, the [[Francization]] of aristocratic martial, social and inheritance customs; the de-Scotticisation of ecclesiastical institutions; the imposition of royal authority over most of modern Scotland; and the drastic drift at the top level from traditional Gaelic culture, so that after David I, the Kingship of the Scots resembled more closely the kingship of the French and English, than it did the lordship of any large-scale Gaelic kingdom in Ireland.\n\nAfter David I, and especially in the reign of William I, Scotland's kings became ambivalent about, if not hostile towards, the culture of most of their subjects. As [[Walter of Coventry]] tells us:\n\n<blockquote>The modern kings of Scotia count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following, and have reduced the Scots [=Gaels north of the Forth] to utter servitude<ref name=\"coventrycitation\">''Memoriale Fratris Walteri de Coventria'', ed. W. Stubbs, (''[[Rolls Series]]'', no. 58), ii.  206.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ambivalence of the kings was matched to a certain extent by their subjects. In the aftermath of William's capture at [[Alnwick]] in 1174, the Scots turned on their king's English-speaking and French-speaking subjects. [[William of Newburgh]] related the events:\n\n<blockquote>When [King William] was given over into the hands of the enemy, God's vengeance permitted not also that his most evil army should go away unhurt. For when they learned of the King's capture the barbarians at first were stunned, and desisted from spoil; and presently, as if driven by furies, the sword which they had taken up against their enemy and which was now drunken with innocent blood they turned against their own army.<br>\n\nNow there was in the same army a great number of English; for the towns and burghs of the Scottish realm are known to be inhabited by English. On the occasion therefore of this opportunity the Scots declared their hatred against them, innate, though masked through fear of the king; and as many as they fell upon they slew, the rest who could escape fleeing back to the royal castles<ref name=\"newburghcitation\">William of Newburgh, Historia Rerum Anglicarum, in R. Howlett (ed.) ''Chronicles of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I'', (''Rolls Series'', no. 82), Vol. I, pp 186&ndash;187.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Walter Bower]], writing a few centuries later albeit, wrote about the same event:\n\n<blockquote>At that time after the capture of their king, the Scots together with the Galwegians, in the mutual slaughter that took place, killed their English and French compatriots without mercy or pity, making frequent attacks on them. At that time also there took place a most wretched and widespread persecution of the English both in Scotland and Galloway. So intense was it that no consideration was shown to the sex of any, but all were cruelly killed ...<ref name=\"bowercitation\">Walter Bower, ''Scottichronicon'', VIII. 22., 30&ndash;40.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOpposition to the Scottish kings in this period was indeed hard. The first instance is perhaps the revolt of [[\u00d3engus of Moray]], the [[Mormaer of Moray]], the crushing of which led to the colonisation of Moray by foreign burgesses, and Franco-Flemish and Anglo-French aristocrats. Rebellions continued throughout the 12th century and into the 13th. Important resistors to the expansionary Scottish kings were [[Somerled|Somhairle Mac Gille Brighdhe]], [[Fergus of Galloway]], [[Gille Brigte of Galloway]] and [[Harald Maddadsson]], along with two kin-groups known today as the [[MacHeths]] and the [[Meic Uilleim]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The latter claimed descent from king [[Duncan II of Scotland|Donnchadh II]], through his son William, and rebelled for no less a reason than the Scottish throne itself. The threat was so grave that, after the defeat of the MacWilliams in 1230, the Scottish crown ordered the public execution of the baby girl who happened to be the last MacWilliam. This was how the [[Lanercost Chronicle]] relates the fate of this last MacWilliam:\n\n<blockquote>the same Mac-William's daughter, who had not long left her mother's womb, innocent as she was, was put to death, in the burgh of Forfar, in view of the market place, after a proclamation by the public crier. Her head was struck against the column of the market cross, and her brains dashed out<ref name=\"macwilliamcitation\">''Chronicle of Lanercost'', 40&ndash;1, quoted in McDonald, ''Outlaws'', p. 46.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany of these resistors collaborated, and drew support not just in the peripheral Gaelic regions of Galloway, Moray, Ross and Argyll, but also from eastern \"Scotland-proper\", Ireland and [[Isle of Man|Mann]]. By the end of the 12th century, the Scottish kings had acquired the authority and ability to draw in native Gaelic lords outside their previous zone of control to do their work, the most famous examples being [[Lochlann, Lord of Galloway]] and [[Fearchar, Earl of Ross|Fearchar Mac an t-Sagairt]].\n\nSuch accommodation assisted expansion to the Scandinavian-ruled lands of the west. [[Uilleam I, Earl of Ross|Uilleam]], the native [[Mormaer of Ross]], was a pivotal figure in the expansion of the Scottish kingdom into the [[Hebrides]], as was [[Ail\u00e9an mac Ruaidhr\u00ed]], the key pro-Scottish Hebridean chief, who married his daughter to [[Uilleam, Earl of Mar|Uilleam]], the [[Mormaer of Mar]]. The Scottish king was able to draw on the support of [[Alan, Lord of Galloway]], the master of the [[Irish Sea]] region, and was able to make use of the Galwegian ruler's enormous fleet of ships. The [[Mormaer of Lennox|Mormaers of Lennox]] forged links with the Argyll chieftains, bringing a kin-group such as the [[Clan Campbell|Campbells]] into the Scottish fold. Cumulatively, by the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a strong position to annexe the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did in 1266, with the [[Treaty of Perth]]. [[Orkney]] too was coming into the Scottish fold. In the 12th century, Mormaer [[Matad, Earl of Atholl|Matad]]'s son [[Harald Maddadsson, Earl of Orkney|Harald]] was established on the [[Earl of Orkney|Orkney Earldom]]. Thereafter, the Orkney earl (also Mormaer of Caithness) was just as much a Scottish vassal as a Norwegian one. Descendants of the Gaelic [[Mormaer of Angus|Mormaers of Angus]] ruled Orkney for much of the 13th century. In the early 14th century, another Scottish Gaelic noble, [[Maol \u00cdosa V, Earl of Strathearn|Maol \u00cdosa V]] of Strathearn became Earl of Orkney, although formal Scottish sovereignty over the [[Northern Isles]] did not come for more than another century.\n\nThe conquest of the west, the creation of the Mormaerdom of Carrick in 1186 and the absorption of the [[Lords of Galloway|Lordship of Galloway]] after the [[Gille Ruadh|Galwegian revolt]] of 1135 meant that the number and proportion of Gaelic speakers under the rule of the Scottish king actually increased, and perhaps even doubled, in the so-called Norman period. It was the Gaels and [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] warriors of the new west, and the power they offered, that enabled King [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]] (himself a Gaelicised [[Scoto-Norman]] of [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]]) to emerge victorious during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence|Wars of Independence]], which followed soon after the death of Alexander III.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Albany (disambiguation)|Albany]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n<!-- Dead note \"SCCitation\": [[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]; A.O.

The name is one of convenience, as throughout this period the elite and populace of the Kingdom were predominantly Pictish-Gaels or later Pictish-Gaels and [[Scoto-Norman]], and differs markedly from the period of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]], in which the elite of the kingdom were (for the most part) speakers of [[Middle English]], which later evolved and came to be called [[History of the Scots language|Lowland Scots]]. There is no precise Gaelic equivalent for the English terminology \"Kingdom of Alba\", as the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] term ''R\u00ecoghachd na h-Alba'' means 'Kingdom of Scotland'.  English-speaking scholars adapted the Gaelic name for Scotland to apply to a particular political period in Scottish history during the [[High Middle Ages]].\n\n==Royal court==\nLittle is known about the structure of the Scottish [[royal court]] in the period before the coming of the Normans to Scotland, before the reign of David I. A little more is known about the court of the later 12th and 13th centuries. In the words of Geoffrey Barrow, this court \"was emphatically feudal, Frankish, non-Celtic in character\".<ref name=\"barcourtcitation\">Barrow, ''Robert Bruce'', (1998), p. 7.</ref> Some of the offices were [[Gael]]ic in origin, such as the ''[[Hostarius (Scotland)|Hostarius]]'' (later Usher or \"Doorward\"), the man in charge of the royal bodyguard, and the ''rannaire'', the [[Scots Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking member of the court whose job was to divide the food.<ref name=\"rannairecitation\">Barrow, ''Kingship and Unity'', p. 34.</ref>\n\n*The '''[[Seneschal]]''' or ''dapifer'' (i.e. the [[Butler|Steward]]), had been hereditary since the reign of David I. The Steward had responsibility for the royal household and its management. (see [[High Steward of Scotland]]).\n*The '''[[Chancellor]]''' was in charge of the royal chapel. The latter was the king's place of worship, but as it happened, was associated with the royal [[scribes]], responsible for keeping records. Usually, the chancellor was a clergyman, and usually he held this office before being promoted to a bishopric (see [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland]]).\n*The '''[[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]]''' had control and responsibility over royal finances (see [[Chamberlain of Scotland]])\n*The '''[[Constable]]''' was also hereditary since the reign of David I and was in charge of the crown's military resources (see [[Lord High Constable of Scotland]]).\n*The '''[[Butler]]''' (see [[Butler of Scotland]])\n*The '''[[Marshal]]''' or ''marischal''. The marischal differed from the constable in that he was more specialised, responsible for and in charge of the royal cavalry forces (see [[Earl Marischal]])\n\nIn the 13th century, all the other offices tended to be hereditary, with the exception of the Chancellor. The royal household of course came with numerous other offices. The most important was probably the aforementioned ''hostarius'', but there were others such as the royal hunters, the royal foresters and the cooks (''dispensa'' or ''spence'').\n\n==Kings of Alba==\n{{further|Origins of the Kingdom of Alba|List of Scottish monarchs}}\n\n===Donald II and Constantine II===\nKing [[Donald II of Scotland|Donald II]] was the first man to have been called ''r\u00ed Alban'' (i.e. ''King of Alba''), when he died at [[Dunnotar Castle|Dunnottar]] in 900.<ref name=\"albacitation\">[[Annals of Ulster|AU]], s.a. 900; A.O. Anderson, ''Early Sources'', vol. i, p. 395</ref> This meant king of [[Caledonia]] or Scotland. All his predecessors bore the style of either ''King of the [[Picts]]'' or ''King of [[Fortriu]]''. Such an apparent innovation in the Gaelic chronicles is occasionally taken to spell the birth of Scotland, but there is nothing special about his reign that might confirm this. Donald had the nickname ''d\u00e1sachtach''. This simply meant a madman, or in early Irish law, a man not in control of his functions and hence without legal culpability.<ref name=\"kelly1citation\">Kelly, ''Early Irish Law'', (1998), p.92.</ref> The reason was possibly the restlessness of his reign, continually spent fighting battles against [[Vikings]]. It is possible he gained his unpopularity by violating the rights of the church or through high taxes, but it is not known for certain. However, his extremely negative nickname makes him an unlikely founder of Scotland.\n\nDonald's successor [[Constantine II of Scotland|Constantine II]] (Causant\u00edn mac Aeda) is more often regarded as a key figure in the formation of Alba.<ref name=\"isos1citation\">e.g. [[BBC]] documentary ''In Search of Scotland'', ep. 2.</ref> Constantine reigned for nearly half a century, fighting many battles. When he lost at [[Brunanburh]], he was clearly discredited and retired as a [[Culdee]] monk at St. Andrews. Despite this, the [[Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n]] is full of praise for the king, and in this respect is in line with the views of other sources. Constantine is credited in later tradition as the man who, with bishop Ceallach of St Andrews, brought the [[Catholic Church]] in Scotland into conformity with that of the larger [[Gael]]ic world, although it is not known exactly what this means. There had been Gaelic bishops in St Andrews for two centuries, and Gaelic churchmen were amongst the oldest features of Caledonian Christianity. The reform may have been organizational, or some sort of purge of certain unknown and perhaps disliked legacies of Pictish ecclesiastical tradition. However, other than these factors, it is difficult to appreciate fully the importance of Constantine's reign.\n\n===Malcolm I to Malcolm II===\nThe period between the accession of [[Malcolm I of Scotland|Malcolm I]] (Maol Caluim Mac Domhnuill) and [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]] (Maol Caluim Mac Cionaodha) is marked by good relations with the [[Wessex]] [[Kings of England|rulers of England]], intense internal dynastic disunity and, despite this, relatively successful expansionary policies. Some time after an English invasion of ''cumbra land'' ([[Old English language|Old English]] for either [[Strathclyde]] or [[Cumbria]] or both) by King Edmund of England in 945, the English king handed the province over to king Malcolm I on condition of a permanent alliance. Some time in the reign of King [[Indulf of Scotland|Indulf]] (Idulb mac Causant\u00edn) (954\u201362), the Scots captured the fortress called ''oppidum Eden'', i.e. almost certainly [[Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"hud1citation\">Hudson, ''Celtic Kings'', (1994), p. 89</ref> It was the first Scottish foothold in [[Lothian]]. The Scots had probably had some authority in Strathclyde since the later part of the 9th century, but the kingdom kept its own rulers, and it is not clear that the Scots were always strong enough to enforce their authority. In fact, one of Indulf's successors, [[Culen of Scotland|Cuil\u00e9n]] (Cuil\u00e9n mac Ilduilbh), died at the hands of the men of Strathclyde, perhaps while trying to enforce his authority. King [[Kenneth II of Scotland|Kenneth II]] (Cionaodh Mac Maol Chaluim) (971\u201395) began his reign by invading ''Britannia'' (possibly Strathclyde), perhaps as an early assertion of his authority, and perhaps also as a traditional Gaelic ''crechr\u00edghe'' (lit. \"royal prey\"), the rite by which a king secured the success of his reign with an inauguration raid in the territory of a historical enemy.<ref name=\"hud2citation\">Hudson, ''Celtic Kings'', (1994), pp. 95\u20136</ref>\n\nThe reign of Malcolm I (942/3\u2013954) also marks the first known tensions between the Scottish kingdom and [[Mormaer of Moray|Moray]], the old heartland of the Scoto-Pictish kingdom of [[Fortriu]]. The ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' reported that King Malcolm \"went into Moray and slew Ceallach.\" The same source tells us that King Malcolm was killed by the Moravians.<ref name=\"cellachcitation\">A.O. Anderson, ''Early Sources'', vol. i, p. 452.</ref> This is the first definite sign of tension between the ''[[Cen\u00e9l nGabr\u00e1in]]'' and ''[[Cen\u00e9l Loairn]]'', two kin-groups claiming descent from different ancestors of [[Erc of Dalriada|Erc]]. During the reign of [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] (Mac Beathadh Mac Findl\u00e1ich), and his successor [[Lulach of Scotland|Lulach]] (Lulach Mac Gille Comhgh\u00e1in), the Moray-based ''Cen\u00e9l Loairn'' ruled all Scotland.\n\nThe reign of Malcolm II saw the final incorporation of these territories. The critical year perhaps was 1018, when King Malcolm II defeated the Northumbrians at the [[Battle of Carham]]. In the same year, King [[Owain Foel]] died, leaving his kingdom to his overlord Malcolm. A meeting with King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] of Denmark and England, probably about 1031, seems to have further secured these conquests, although the exact nature of Scottish rule over the Lothian and [[Scottish Borders]] area was not fully realised until the conquest and annexation of that province during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence|Wars of Independence]].\n\n===Duncan I to Alexander I===\n[[File:Coronation Chair and Stone of Scone. Anonymous Engraver. Published in A History of England (1855).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Stone of Scone]] in the Coronation Chair at [[Westminster Abbey]], 1855. It was the ceremonial coronation stone of Scotland's Gaelic kings, similar to the Irish [[Lia F\u00e1il]].]]\n\nThe period between the accession of King [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan I]] (Donnchadh Mac Cr\u00edon\u00e1in) (1034) and the death of [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] (1124) was the last before the coming of the [[Normans]] to Scotland. In some respects, the reign of King [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]] (Maol Caluim Mac Donnchaidh) prefigured the changes which took place in the reigns of the French-speaking kings [[David I of Scotland|David I]] and [[William I of Scotland|William I]], although native reaction to the manner of [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]]'s (Donnchad mac M\u00e1el Coluim) accession perhaps put these changes back somewhat.\n\nKing Duncan I's reign was a military failure. He was defeated by the native English at [[Durham, England|Durham]] in 1040, and was subsequently toppled.  Duncan had only been related to previous rulers through his mother [[Bethoc]], daughter of Malcolm II, who had married [[Abbot Crinan|Cr\u00edn\u00e1n]], the lay abbot of [[Dunkeld]] (and probably [[Mormaer of Atholl]] too). At a location called ''Bothganowan'' (or ''Bothgowan'', ''Bothgofnane'', ''Bothgofuane'', meaning \"Blacksmith's Hut\" in old Gaelic,<ref>[http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/historical_sources_of_macbeth.html Historical Sources of Macbeth.]</ref> today ''Pitgaveny'' near [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]]), the [[Mormaer of Moray]], [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] defeated and killed Duncan, and took the kingship for himself.<ref name=\"hud3citation\">Hudson, ''Celtic Kings'', p. 124.</ref> After Macbeth's successor Lulach, another Moravian, all kings of Scotland were Duncan's descendants. For this reason, Duncan's reign is often remembered positively, while Macbeth is villanised. Eventually, [[William Shakespeare]] gave fame to this medieval equivalent of propaganda by further immortalising both men in his play [[Macbeth]]. Macbeth's reign however was successful enough that he had the security to go on [[pilgrimage]] to Rome.\n\nIt was Malcolm III who acquired the nickname (as did his successors) \"Canmore\" (''Ceann M\u00f3r'', \"Great Chief\"), and not his father Duncan, who did more to create the successful dynasty which ruled Scotland for the following two centuries. Part of the success was the huge number of children he had. Through two marriages, firstly to the Norwegian [[Ingibiorg Finnsdottir]], and secondly to the English princess [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret of Wessex]], Malcolm had perhaps a [[dozen]] children. Malcolm and, if we believe later hagiography, his wife, introduced the first [[Benedictine]] monks to Scotland. However, despite having a royal [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] wife, Malcolm spent more of his reign conducting slave raids against the English, adding to the woes of that people in the aftermath of the [[Norman Conquest of England]] and the [[Harrying of the North]], as [[Marianus Scotus]] tells us:\n\n<blockquote>the Scots and French devastated the English; and [the English] were dispersed and died of hunger; and were compelled to eat human flesh: and to this end, to kill men, and to salt and dry them''.\u201d<ref name=\"marianuscitation\">A.O. Anderson, ''Early Sources'', vol. ii, p. 23, & n. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMalcolm died in one of these raids, in 1093. In the aftermath of his death, the Norman rulers of England began their interference in the Scottish kingdom. This interference was prompted by Malcolm's raids and attempts to forge claims for his successors to the English kingship. He had married the sister of the native English claimant to the English throne, [[Edgar \u00c6theling]], and had given most of his children by this marriage Anglo-Saxon royal names. Moreover, he had given support to many native English nobles, including Edgar himself, and had been supporting native English insurrections against their Norman rulers. In 1080, King [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] sent his son on an invasion of Scotland. The invasion got as far as [[Falkirk]], on the boundary between Scotland-proper and Lothian, and Malcolm submitted to the authority of the king, giving his oldest son Duncan as a hostage. This submission perhaps gives the reason why Malcolm did not give his last two sons, Alexander and David, Anglo-Saxon royal names.\n\nMalcolm's natural successor was his brother, [[Donald III of Scotland|Donalbane]] (Domhnall B\u00e1n Mac Donnchaidh), as Malcolm's sons were young. However, the Norman state to the south sent Malcolm's son Duncan to take the kingship. In the ensuing conflict, the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' tells us that:\n\n<blockquote>Donnchadh went to Scotland with what aid he could get of the English and French, and deprived his kinsman Domhnall of the Kingdom, and was received as King. But afterwards some of the Scots gathered themselves together, and slew almost all of his followers; and he himself escaped with few. Thereafter they were reconciled on the condition that he should never again introduce English or French into the land''\u201d{{NoteTag|Normanists tend to sideline or downplay opposition amongst the native Scots to Canmore authority, but much work has been done on the topic recently, especially R. Andrew McDonald, ''Outlaws of Medieval Scotland: Challenges to the Canmore Kings, 1058&ndash;1266'', (East Linton, 2003).}}</blockquote>\n\nDuncan was killed the same year, 1094, and Donalbane resumed sole kingship. However, the Norman state sent another of Malcolm's sons, [[Edgar of Scotland|Edgar]] to take the kingship. Anglo-Norman policy worked, because thereafter all kings of Scotland succeeded, not without opposition of course, under a system very closely corresponding with the [[primogeniture]] that operated in the French-speaking world. The reigns of both Edgar and his brother and successor Alexander are comparatively obscure. The former's most notable act was to send a [[camel]] (or perhaps an elephant) to his fellow Gael [[Muircheartach Ua Briain|Muirchertach Ua Briain]], [[High King of Ireland]].<ref name=\"camelcitation\">[[Annals of Inisfallen]], s.a. 1105&ndash;[[1107/7]], available [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100004 here];</ref> When Edgar died, Alexander took the kingship, while his youngest brother David became Prince of \"Cumbria\" and ruler of Lothian.\n\n===Norman Kings: David I to Alexander III===\n[[File:BookDeerLukeFol029v.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Book of Deer]]'', folio 29v contains a portrait of the [[Luke the Evangelist|Evangelist Luke]]; a list of privileges and legends were written in Gaelic and Latin in the margins, in lowland [[Mormaer of Buchan|Buchan]] in the reign of David I.]]\nThe period between the accession of David I and the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] was marked by dependence upon, and relatively good relations with, the Kings of the English. It was also a period of historical expansion for the Scottish kingdom, and witnessed the successful imposition of royal authority across most of the modern country. The period was one of a great deal of historical change, and much of the modern historiographical literature is devoted to this change (especially G.W.S. Barrow), part of a more general phenomenon which has been called the \"Europeanisation of Europe\".<ref name=\"bartlettcitation\">Bartlett, ''The Making of Europe'' (1993).</ref> More recent works though, while acknowledging that a great deal of change did take place, emphasise that this period was in fact also one of great continuity (e.g. Cynthia Neville, Richard Oram, Dauvit Broun, and others). Indeed, the period is subject to many misconceptions. For instance, English did not spread all over the Lowlands (see language section), and neither did English names; and, moreover even by 1300, most native lordships remained in native Gaelic hands, with only a minority passing to men of French or Anglo-French origin; furthermore, the Normanisation and imposition of royal authority in Scotland was not a peaceful process, but in fact cumulatively more violent than the Norman Conquest of England; additionally, the Scottish kings were not independent monarchs, but vassals to the King of the English, although not \"legally\" for Scotland north of the Forth.\n\nThe important changes which did occur include the extensive establishment of [[burgh]]s (see section), in many respects Scotland's first urban institutions; the [[Feudalism|feudalisation]], or more accurately, the [[Francization]] of aristocratic martial, social and inheritance customs; the de-Scotticisation of ecclesiastical institutions; the imposition of royal authority over most of modern Scotland; and the drastic drift at the top level from traditional Gaelic culture, so that after David I, the Kingship of the Scots resembled more closely the kingship of the French and English, than it did the lordship of any large-scale Gaelic kingdom in Ireland.\n\nAfter David I, and especially in the reign of William I, Scotland's King's became ambivalent about, if not hostile towards, the culture of most of their subjects. As [[Walter of Coventry]] tells us:\n\n<blockquote>The modern kings of Scotia count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following, and have reduced the Scots [=Gaels north of the Forth] to utter servitude<ref name=\"coventrycitation\">''Memoriale Fratris Walteri de Coventria'', ed. W. Stubbs, (''[[Rolls Series]]'', no. 58), ii.  206.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ambivalence of the kings was matched to a certain extent by their subjects. In the aftermath of William's capture at [[Alnwick]] in 1174, the Scots turned on their king's English-speaking and French-speaking subjects. [[William of Newburgh]] related the events:\n\n<blockquote>When [King William] was given over into the hands of the enemy, God's vengeance permitted not also that his most evil army should go away unhurt. For when they learned of the King's capture the barbarians at first were stunned, and desisted from spoil; and presently, as if driven by furies, the sword which they had taken up against their enemy and which was now drunken with innocent blood they turned against their own army.<br>\n\nNow there was in the same army a great number of English; for the towns and burghs of the Scottish realm are known to be inhabited by English. On the occasion therefore of this opportunity the Scots declared their hatred against them, innate, though masked through fear of the king; and as many as they fell upon they slew, the rest who could escape fleeing back to the royal castles<ref name=\"newburghcitation\">William of Newburgh, Historia Rerum Anglicarum, in R. Howlett (ed.) ''Chronicles of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I'', (''Rolls Series'', no. 82), Vol. I, pp 186&ndash;187.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Walter Bower]], writing a few centuries later albeit, wrote about the same event:\n\n<blockquote>At that time after the capture of their king, the Scots together with the Galwegians, in the mutual slaughter that took place, killed their English and French compatriots without mercy or pity, making frequent attacks on them. At that time also there took place a most wretched and widespread persecution of the English both in Scotland and Galloway. So intense was it that no consideration was shown to the sex of any, but all were cruelly killed ...<ref name=\"bowercitation\">Walter Bower, ''Scottichronicon'', VIII. 22., 30&ndash;40.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOpposition to the Scottish kings in this period was indeed hard. The first instance is perhaps the revolt of [[\u00d3engus of Moray]], the [[Mormaer of Moray]], the crushing of which led to the colonisation of Moray by foreign burgesses, and Franco-Flemish and Anglo-French aristocrats. Rebellions continued throughout the 12th century and into the 13th. Important resistors to the expansionary Scottish kings were [[Somerled|Somhairle Mac Gille Brighdhe]], [[Fergus of Galloway]], [[Gille Brigte of Galloway]] and [[Harald Maddadsson]], along with two kin-groups known today as the [[MacHeths]] and the [[Meic Uilleim]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The latter claimed descent from king [[Duncan II of Scotland|Donnchadh II]], through his son William, and rebelled for no less a reason than the Scottish throne itself. The threat was so grave that, after the defeat of the MacWilliams in 1230, the Scottish crown ordered the public execution of the baby girl who happened to be the last MacWilliam. This was how the [[Lanercost Chronicle]] relates the fate of this last MacWilliam:\n\n<blockquote>the same Mac-William's daughter, who had not long left her mother's womb, innocent as she was, was put to death, in the burgh of Forfar, in view of the market place, after a proclamation by the public crier. Her head was struck against the column of the market cross, and her brains dashed out<ref name=\"macwilliamcitation\">''Chronicle of Lanercost'', 40&ndash;1, quoted in McDonald, ''Outlaws'', p. 46.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany of these resistors collaborated, and drew support not just in the peripheral Gaelic regions of Galloway, Moray, Ross and Argyll, but also from eastern \"Scotland-proper\", Ireland and [[Isle of Man|Mann]]. By the end of the 12th century, the Scottish kings had acquired the authority and ability to draw in native Gaelic lords outside their previous zone of control to do their work, the most famous examples being [[Lochlann, Lord of Galloway]] and [[Fearchar, Earl of Ross|Fearchar Mac an t-Sagairt]].\n\nSuch accommodation assisted expansion to the Scandinavian-ruled lands of the west. [[Uilleam I, Earl of Ross|Uilleam]], the native [[Mormaer of Ross]], was a pivotal figure in the expansion of the Scottish kingdom into the [[Hebrides]], as was [[Ail\u00e9an mac Ruaidhr\u00ed]], the key pro-Scottish Hebridean chief, who married his daughter to [[Uilleam, Earl of Mar|Uilleam]], the [[Mormaer of Mar]]. The Scottish king was able to draw on the support of [[Alan, Lord of Galloway]], the master of the [[Irish Sea]] region, and was able to make use of the Galwegian ruler's enormous fleet of ships. The [[Mormaer of Lennox|Mormaers of Lennox]] forged links with the Argyll chieftains, bringing a kin-group such as the [[Clan Campbell|Campbells]] into the Scottish fold. Cumulatively, by the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a strong position to annexe the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did in 1266, with the [[Treaty of Perth]]. [[Orkney]] too was coming into the Scottish fold. In the 12th century, Mormaer [[Matad, Earl of Atholl|Matad]]'s son [[Harald Maddadsson, Earl of Orkney|Harald]] was established on the [[Earl of Orkney|Orkney Earldom]]. Thereafter, the Orkney earl (also Mormaer of Caithness) was just as much a Scottish vassal as a Norwegian one. Descendants of the Gaelic [[Mormaer of Angus|Mormaers of Angus]] ruled Orkney for much of the 13th century. In the early 14th century, another Scottish Gaelic noble, [[Maol \u00cdosa V, Earl of Strathearn|Maol \u00cdosa V]] of Strathearn became Earl of Orkney, although formal Scottish sovereignty over the [[Northern Isles]] did not come for more than another century.\n\nThe conquest of the west, the creation of the Mormaerdom of Carrick in 1186 and the absorption of the [[Lords of Galloway|Lordship of Galloway]] after the [[Gille Ruadh|Galwegian revolt]] of 1135 meant that the number and proportion of Gaelic speakers under the rule of the Scottish king actually increased, and perhaps even doubled, in the so-called Norman period. It was the Gaels and [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] warriors of the new west, and the power they offered, that enabled King [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]] (himself a Gaelicised [[Scoto-Norman]] of [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]]) to emerge victorious during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence|Wars of Independence]], which followed soon after the death of Alexander III.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Albany (disambiguation)|Albany]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n<!-- Dead note \"SCCitation\": [[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]; A.O.

One of the longest-lived empires in world history, it existed for almost six centuries, from the capture of [[Ceuta]] in 1415, to the handover of [[Portuguese Macau]] to [[China]] in 1999. The empire began in the 15th century, and from the early 16th century it stretched across the globe, with bases in [[Portuguese Empire#Canada|North]] and [[Portuguese Empire#Brazil|South America]], [[Portuguese Empire#Sub-Saharan Africa|Africa]], and various regions of [[Portuguese Empire#Goa, Malacca and Southeast Asia|Asia]] and [[Portuguese Empire#Spice Islands (Moluccas) and Treaty of Zaragoza|Oceania]].<ref name=\"PageSonnenburg481\">{{harvnb|Page|Sonnenburg|2003|p=481}}</ref><ref name=\"Brockeyxv\">{{harvnb|Brockey|2008|p=xv}}</ref><ref name=\"JuangMorrissette894\">{{harvnb|Juang|Morrissette|2008|p=894}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese Empire originated at the beginning of the [[Age of Discovery]], and the power and influence of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] would eventually expand across the globe. In the wake of the [[Reconquista]], [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese sailors began exploring]] the coast of Africa and the Atlantic archipelagos in 1418\u201319, using recent developments in navigation, cartography and maritime technology such as the [[caravel]], with the aim of finding a sea route to the source of the lucrative [[spice trade|spice-trade]]. In 1488 [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and in 1498 [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India. In 1500, either by an accidental landfall or by the crown's secret design, [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] discovered Brazil on the South American coast.\n\nOver the following decades, Portuguese sailors continued to explore the coasts and islands of East Asia, establishing [[List of Portuguese colonial forts|forts]] and [[Factory (trading post)#Portuguese Feitorias (c. 1445)|factories]] as they went. By 1571 a string of naval outposts connected [[Lisbon]] to [[Nagasaki]] along the coasts of Africa, the Middle East, India and South Asia. This commercial network and the colonial trade had a substantial positive impact on Portuguese economic growth (1500\u20131800), when it accounted for about a fifth of Portugal's per-capita income.\n\nWhen King [[Philip II of Spain]] (Philip I of Portugal) [[War of the Portuguese Succession|seized the Portuguese crown]] in 1580 there began a 60-year union between Spain and Portugal known to subsequent [[historiography]] as the [[Iberian Union]]. The realms continued to have separate administrations. As the King of Spain was also King of Portugal, Portuguese colonies became the subject of attacks by three rival European powers hostile to Spain: the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch Republic]], [[English overseas possessions|England]], and [[French colonial empire|France]]. With its smaller population, Portugal found itself unable to effectively defend its overstretched network of trading posts, and the empire began a long and gradual decline. Eventually, Brazil became the most valuable colony of the second era of empire (1663\u20131825), until, as part of the wave of [[Decolonization of the Americas|independence movements]] that swept the [[Americas]] during the early 19th century, it broke away in 1822.\n\nThe third era of empire covers the final stage of Portuguese colonialism after the [[independence of Brazil]] in the 1820s. By then, the colonial possessions had been reduced to [[Portuguese Africa|forts and plantations along the African coastline]] (expanded inland during the [[Scramble for Africa]] in the late 19th century), [[Portuguese Timor]], and [[Enclave and exclave|enclaves]] in India ([[Portuguese India]]) and China ([[Portuguese Macau]]). The [[1890 British Ultimatum]] led to the contraction of [[Pink Map|Portuguese ambitions in Africa]].\n\nUnder [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Ant\u00f3nio Salazar]] (in office 1932\u20131968), the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Second Portuguese Republic]] made some ill-fated attempts to cling on to its last remaining colonies. Under the ideology of [[Pluricontinentalism]], the regime renamed its colonies \"[[overseas province]]s\" while retaining the [[Chibalo|system of forced labour]], from which only a small [[Assimilado|indigenous \u00e9lite]] was normally exempt. In 1961 India [[Annexation of Goa|annexed Goa]] and Dahomey (now Benin) annexed [[Fort of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]]. The [[Portuguese Colonial War]] in Africa lasted from 1961 until the final overthrow of the Estado Novo regime in 1974. The so-called [[Carnation Revolution]] of April 1974 in Lisbon led to the hasty [[decolonization of Africa|decolonization of Portuguese Africa]] and to the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|1975 annexation of Portuguese Timor]] by Indonesia. Decolonization prompted the exodus of nearly all the [[retornados|Portuguese colonial settlers]] and of many [[Luso-Africans|mixed-race people]] from the colonies. Portugal [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|returned]] [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] to China in 1999. The only overseas possessions to remain under Portuguese rule, the [[Autonomous Regions of Portugal|Azores and Madeira]], both had overwhelmingly [[Portuguese people|Portuguese populations]], and Lisbon subsequently changed their [[Political status of the Azores|constitutional status]] from \"[[overseas province]]s\" to \"[[autonomous regions]]\".\n\n==Background (1139\u20131415)==\n{{main|History of Portugal (1139\u20131415)}}\n[[File:Infante D.

Soon its ships were bringing into the European market highly valued gold, ivory, pepper, cotton, sugar, and slaves. The slave trade, for example, was conducted by a few dozen merchants in Lisbon. In the process of expanding the trade routes, Portuguese navigators mapped unknown parts of Africa, and began exploring the Indian Ocean. In 1487, an overland expedition by [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] made its way to India, exploring trade opportunities with the Indians and Arabs, and winding up finally in Ethiopia. His detailed report was eagerly read in Lisbon, which became the best informed center for global geography and trade routes.<ref>L.S.

One of the longest-lived empires in world history, it existed for almost six centuries, from the capture of [[Ceuta]] in 1415, to the handover of [[Portuguese Macau]] to [[China]] in 1999. The empire began in the 15th century, and from the early 16th century it stretched across the globe, with bases in [[Portuguese Empire#Canada|North]] and [[Portuguese Empire#Brazil|South America]], [[Portuguese Empire#Sub-Saharan Africa|Africa]], and various regions of [[Portuguese Empire#Goa, Malacca and Southeast Asia|Asia]] and [[Portuguese Empire#Spice Islands (Moluccas) and Treaty of Zaragoza|Oceania]].<ref name=\"PageSonnenburg481\">{{harvnb|Page|Sonnenburg|2003|p=481}}</ref><ref name=\"Brockeyxv\">{{harvnb|Brockey|2008|p=xv}}</ref><ref name=\"JuangMorrissette894\">{{harvnb|Juang|Morrissette|2008|p=894}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese Empire originated at the beginning of the [[Age of Discovery]], and the power and influence of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] would eventually expand across the globe. In the wake of the [[Reconquista]], [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese sailors began exploring]] the coast of Africa and the Atlantic archipelagos in 1418\u201319, using recent developments in navigation, cartography and maritime technology such as the [[caravel]], with the aim of finding a sea route to the source of the lucrative [[spice trade|spice-trade]]. In 1488 [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and in 1498 [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India. In 1500, either by an accidental landfall or by the crown's secret design, [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] discovered Brazil on the South American coast.\n\nOver the following decades, Portuguese sailors continued to explore the coasts and islands of East Asia, establishing [[List of Portuguese colonial forts|forts]] and [[Factory (trading post)#Portuguese Feitorias (c. 1445)|factories]] as they went. By 1571 a string of naval outposts connected [[Lisbon]] to [[Nagasaki]] along the coasts of Africa, the Middle East, India and South Asia. This commercial network and the colonial trade had a substantial positive impact on Portuguese economic growth (1500\u20131800), when it accounted for about a fifth of Portugal's per-capita income.\n\nWhen King [[Philip II of Spain]] (Philip I of Portugal) [[War of the Portuguese Succession|seized the Portuguese crown]] in 1580 there began a 60-year union between Spain and Portugal known to subsequent [[historiography]] as the [[Iberian Union]]. The realms continued to have separate administrations. As the King of Spain was also King of Portugal, Portuguese colonies became the subject of attacks by three rival European powers hostile to Spain: the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch Republic]], [[English overseas possessions|England]], and [[French colonial empire|France]]. With its smaller population, Portugal found itself unable to effectively defend its overstretched network of trading posts, and the empire began a long and gradual decline. Eventually, Brazil became the most valuable colony of the second era of empire (1663\u20131825), until, as part of the wave of [[Decolonization of the Americas|independence movements]] that swept the [[Americas]] during the early 19th century, it broke away in 1822.\n\nThe third era of empire covers the final stage of Portuguese colonialism after the [[independence of Brazil]] in the 1820s. By then, the colonial possessions had been reduced to [[Portuguese Africa|forts and plantations along the African coastline]] (expanded inland during the [[Scramble for Africa]] in the late 19th century), [[Portuguese Timor]], and [[Enclave and exclave|enclaves]] in India ([[Portuguese India]]) and China ([[Portuguese Macau]]). The [[1890 British Ultimatum]] led to the contraction of [[Pink Map|Portuguese ambitions in Africa]].\n\nUnder [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Ant\u00f3nio Salazar]] (in office 1932\u20131968), the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Second Portuguese Republic]] made some ill-fated attempts to cling on to its last remaining colonies. Under the ideology of [[Pluricontinentalism]], the regime renamed its colonies \"[[overseas province]]s\" while retaining the [[Chibalo|system of forced labour]], from which only a small [[Assimilado|indigenous \u00e9lite]] was normally exempt. In 1961 India [[Annexation of Goa|annexed Goa]] and Dahomey (now Benin) annexed [[Fort of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]]. The [[Portuguese Colonial War]] in Africa lasted from 1961 until the final overthrow of the Estado Novo regime in 1974. The so-called [[Carnation Revolution]] of April 1974 in Lisbon led to the hasty [[decolonization of Africa|decolonization of Portuguese Africa]] and to the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|1975 annexation of Portuguese Timor]] by Indonesia. Decolonization prompted the exodus of nearly all the [[retornados|Portuguese colonial settlers]] and of many [[Luso-Africans|mixed-race people]] from the colonies. Portugal [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|returned]] [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] to China in 1999. The only overseas possessions to remain under Portuguese rule, the [[Autonomous Regions of Portugal|Azores and Madeira]], both had overwhelmingly [[Portuguese people|Portuguese populations]], and Lisbon subsequently changed their [[Political status of the Azores|constitutional status]] from \"[[overseas province]]s\" to \"[[autonomous regions]]\".\n\n==Background (1139\u20131415)==\n{{main|History of Portugal (1139\u20131415)}}\n[[File:Infante D.

The ensuing [[Cold War]] also created instabilities among Portuguese overseas populations, as the United States and [[Soviet Union]] vied to increase their spheres of influence. Following the granting of independence to India by [[British Empire|Britain]] in 1947, and the decision by France to allow its [[French India|enclaves in India]] to be incorporated into the newly independent nation, pressure was placed on Portugal to do the same.<ref>[[#refPearson|Pearson 1987, p.&nbsp;158]]</ref> This was resisted by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]], who had taken power in 1933. Salazar rebuffed a request in 1950 by [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to return the enclaves, viewing them as integral parts of Portugal.<ref>[[#refPearson|Pearson 1987, p.&nbsp;160]]</ref> The following year, the Portuguese constitution was amended to change the status of the colonies to overseas provinces. In 1954, a local uprising resulted in the overthrow of the Portuguese authorities in the Indian enclave of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]]. The existence of the remaining Portuguese colonies in India became increasingly untenable and Nehru enjoyed the support of almost all the Indian domestic political parties as well as the Soviet Union and its allies. In 1961, shortly after an uprising against the Portuguese in Angola, Nehru ordered the Indian Army into [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]], which were quickly [[1961 Indian Annexation of Goa|captured]] and formally annexed the following year. Salazar refused to recognize the transfer of sovereignty, believing the territories to be merely occupied. The Province of Goa continued to be represented in the Portuguese National Assembly until 1974.<ref name=\"Anderson153\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2000|p=153}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Antonio Salazar-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] sought the preservation of a [[pluricontinental]] Portugal.]]\n\nThe outbreak of violence in February 1961 in Angola was the beginning of the end of Portugal's empire in Africa. Portuguese army officers in Angola held the view that it would be incapable of dealing militarily with an outbreak of guerilla warfare and therefore that negotiations should begin with the independence movements. However, Salazar publicly stated his determination to keep the empire intact, and by the end of the year, 50,000 troops had been stationed there. The same year, the tiny Portuguese fort of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 in [[Ouidah]], a remnant of the West African [[slave trade]], was annexed by the new government of Dahomey (now [[Benin]]) that had gained its independence from France.

In 1974 he became the only non-player to be honoured as the [[Texaco Footballer of the Year]]. In 1984 he was named in the left corner-forward position on the GAA's Team of the Century. He was moved to the opposite corner when he was named on the Team of the Millennium in 1999.\n\n==Early and private life==\nKevin Heffernan was born on 20 August 1929 in [[Dublin]]. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he was not born into a [[Gaelic football|football]] background, as his father's interests included hunting and shooting rather than [[Gaelic games]]. Heffernan's family moved to the Marino area of the city when he was very young, and it was here that he first came into contact with both football and [[hurling]]. He later attended Scoil Mhuire and St. Joseph's [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] school where he made great progress as a hurler and as a footballer.

Heffernan also won six senior [[Dublin Senior Football Championship|county championship]] hurling titles in 1953, 1954, 1955, 1957, 1959 and 1962.\n\n===Inter-county===\nHeffernan played both [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic football|football]] at minor level with [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] in the early 1940s. He had some success at these levels, winning a Leinster minor football medal in 1946 and a Leinster minor hurling medal in 1947. He made his senior debut for the Dublin footballers the same year that he was sitting his [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]], breaking his jaw in a game just days before his first exam.

The era was dominated by the intense rivalry between Dublin and Kerry. In his first championship season in charge he guided 'the Dubs' to their first [[Leinster Senior Football Championship|Leinster]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland]] titles since 1963. Following the completion of the championship Heffernan became the only non-player to be nominated [[Texaco Footballer of the Year]]. In 1975 Dublin captured a second consecutive Leinster title; however, a young [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] team caught Heffernan's teams in a complacent mood in the subsequent All-Ireland final. Dublin bounced back the following year to win the National League as well as a third Leinster title in-a-row before going on to defeat Kerry in the All-Ireland final.\n\nFollowing this victory Heffernan unexpectedly resigned as manager of Dublin, being replaced by [[Tony Hanahoe]] who acted as player-captain-manager. Heffernan returned as manager in 1979 but, after claiming a sixth consecutive Leinster title, lost out to Kerry in the All-Ireland final. Much of the Dublin team fell by the wayside after 1980 but Heffernan built a new team centred on midfield stalwart [[Brian Mullins]] and, in another memorable match remembered mainly for its unsporting conduct, a twelve-man Dublin team to victory over a fourteen-man [[Galway GAA|Galway]] in the All-Ireland Final of 1983. Played in atrocious conditions the referee sent off four players, three of which were from Dublin, and their win saw the team being dubbed 'the twelve apostles'. In January 1986 Heffernan stepped down as Dublin manager.<ref name=\"Poisoned Chalice\">{{cite news |title=New manager must beware of the poisoned chalice |url=http://amp.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/new-manager-must-beware-of-the-poisoned-chalice-26066910.html |accessdate=13 June 2018 |work=amp.independent.ie |date=6 November 2001|first=Martin|last=Breheny|archiveurl=https://amp.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/new-manager-must-beware-of-the-poisoned-chalice-26066910.html |archivedate=6 November 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement and death==\nFollowing his retirement from inter-county management Heffernan continued to have a keen involvement in Gaelic football. In 1984, the GAA's centenary year he was named in the left corner-forward position on the GAA's [[GAA Football Team of the Century|Football Team of the Century]] before later managing the [[Ireland international rules football team|Ireland]] to victory over [[Australia international rules football team|Australia]] in the [[International Rules Series]] in 1986.\n\nIn 2000, Heffernan's status as one of the greatest players of all-time was further cemented when he was named in the left corner-forward position on the GAA's 'Football Team of the Millennium.' He has also continued his involvement with the [[St Vincents GAA|St Vincent's]] club. In 2004, at the age of 74, Heffernan was in charge of the club's under 15 hurling team, which, with a late free from Oliver McElvaney, won a memorable championship final against Cuala, having defeated Ballyboden in the semi-final. This particular St Vincent's team had never beaten either of those clubs before, showing that Heffernan's management touch had not deserted him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stvincentsgaa.ie/AboutUs.aspx?m=fp|title=Famous Players & Teams|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030145245/http://www.stvincentsgaa.ie/AboutUs.aspx?m=fp|archivedate=30 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2006, he trained the club's minor hurling team.\n\nIn 2005, Heffernan was granted the [[Freedom of the City of Dublin]], placing him in a pantheon that includes [[U2]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Bill Clinton]].

Heffernan later won two further Leinster titles in 1959 and 1962, however, there was no further All-Ireland titles. He retired from inter-county football shortly afterwards.\n\n==Managerial career==\n{{Infobox GAA manager \n| name            = Kevin Heffernan\n| irish           =\n| sport           = \n| clyears         = \n| club            = \n| winningclubs    = \n| clallireland    = \n| clprovince      = \n| clcounty        = \n| county          = Dublin\n| icyears         = 1973\u20131976<br>1979\u20131986\n| winningcounties = Dublin\n| icprovince      = 5\n| icallireland    = 3\n| league          = 1/2\n|}}\nFollowing a great inter-county career with [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]], he became [[Manager (Gaelic games)|manager]] of the senior inter-county team in late 1973. The era was dominated by the intense rivalry between Dublin and Kerry. In his first championship season in charge he guided 'the Dubs' to their first [[Leinster Senior Football Championship|Leinster]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland]] titles since 1963. Following the completion of the championship Heffernan became the only non-player to be nominated [[Texaco Footballer of the Year]]. In 1975 Dublin captured a second consecutive Leinster title; however, a young [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] team caught Heffernan's teams in a complacent mood in the subsequent All-Ireland final. Dublin bounced back the following year to win the National League as well as a third Leinster title in-a-row before going on to defeat Kerry in the All-Ireland final.\n\nFollowing this victory Heffernan unexpectedly resigned as manager of Dublin, being replaced by [[Tony Hanahoe]] who acted as player-captain-manager. Heffernan returned as manager in 1979 but, after claiming a sixth consecutive Leinster title, lost out to Kerry in the All-Ireland final. Much of the Dublin team fell by the wayside after 1980 but Heffernan built a new team centred on midfield stalwart [[Brian Mullins]] and, in another memorable match remembered mainly for its unsporting conduct, a twelve-man Dublin team to victory over a fourteen-man [[Galway GAA|Galway]] in the All-Ireland Final of 1983. Played in atrocious conditions the referee sent off four players, three of which were from Dublin, and their win saw the team being dubbed 'the twelve apostles'. In January 1986 Heffernan stepped down as Dublin manager.<ref name=\"Poisoned Chalice\">{{cite news |title=New manager must beware of the poisoned chalice |url=http://amp.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/new-manager-must-beware-of-the-poisoned-chalice-26066910.html |accessdate=13 June 2018 |work=amp.independent.ie |date=6 November 2001|first=Martin|last=Breheny|archiveurl=https://amp.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/new-manager-must-beware-of-the-poisoned-chalice-26066910.html |archivedate=6 November 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement and death==\nFollowing his retirement from inter-county management Heffernan continued to have a keen involvement in Gaelic football. In 1984, the GAA's centenary year he was named in the left corner-forward position on the GAA's [[GAA Football Team of the Century|Football Team of the Century]] before later managing the [[Ireland international rules football team|Ireland]] to victory over [[Australia international rules football team|Australia]] in the [[International Rules Series]] in 1986.\n\nIn 2000, Heffernan's status as one of the greatest players of all-time was further cemented when he was named in the left corner-forward position on the GAA's 'Football Team of the Millennium.' He has also continued his involvement with the [[St Vincents GAA|St Vincent's]] club. In 2004, at the age of 74, Heffernan was in charge of the club's under 15 hurling team, which, with a late free from Oliver McElvaney, won a memorable championship final against Cuala, having defeated Ballyboden in the semi-final. This particular St Vincent's team had never beaten either of those clubs before, showing that Heffernan's management touch had not deserted him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stvincentsgaa.ie/AboutUs.aspx?m=fp|title=Famous Players & Teams|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030145245/http://www.stvincentsgaa.ie/AboutUs.aspx?m=fp|archivedate=30 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2006, he trained the club's minor hurling team.\n\nIn 2005, Heffernan was granted the [[Freedom of the City of Dublin]], placing him in a pantheon that includes [[U2]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Bill Clinton]]. He was also among the 25 recipients of the ''Irish Examiner'' GAA President's Awards for 2006. The ceremony which was presented by the former GAA president [[Se\u00e1n Kelly (Irish politician)|Se\u00e1n Kelly]], took place on 31 March 2006.\n\nHeffernan was a consultant to the management of the [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] minor football team for 2007.
