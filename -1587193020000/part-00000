His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\". Squier's best selling album, 1981's [[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|''Don't Say No'']] is considered a landmark release within the arena rock genre and bridging the gap between power pop and hard rock.\n\nDescribed as a personification of early 80's rock music,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Fz2GbraVXhcpXnoi2Oe1r|title=Billy Squier|website=Spotify|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> Squier's most successful period ranges from 1981 to 1984, during which he scored five Top 10 Mainstream Rock hits (two of which were number ones), two Top 20 singles and three consecutive platinum selling albums, along with cyclic MTV rotation and radio airplay. Despite largely falling out from favour and chart success after the release of the critically panned music video for his 1984 hit \"Rock Me Tonite\", Squier has kept his presence on the rock radio up to this day and attracted strong cult following, with his music being featured on many films and video games. Squier stepped out of music business after the release of his 1993 release ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'', but he has continued performing smaller tours and occasional one-off performances.\n\nHis 1980 song \"The Big Beat\" is one of the most sampled drum breaks ever, being used by artists such as [[Run-DMC]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Jay-Z]], [[UTFO]] and [[Dizzee Rascal]], to name a few. \"The Stroke\" has also shared its fair amount of sampling, most notably in [[Eminem]]'s 2013 hit \"[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life and first bands (1950-1975) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as another story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971.\n\n=== Piper and solo career startoff (1975-1980) ===\nSquier had a short stint with a band called Sidewinders, but his first real experience with the music industry occurred when he left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait.'' The band was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper was managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Squier served both as the main songwriter and frontman of the group, whose style shared similarities with power pop acts such as [[Cheap Trick]] and [[The Knack]], who were enjoying great success at the time.\n\nDespite receiving moderate success at the local rock scene, Piper broke up. Squier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (who has previously had short jobs in [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success: ''Don't Say No'' and ''Emotions in Motion'' (1981-1983) ===\nFollowing a small but fairly successful summer tour with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1980, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack joined forces to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which attracted rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-ups each. The album also featured \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", which became a radio favourite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the b-side for \"In the Dark\"). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straightforward performance-based videos received heavy rotation. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''Don't Say No'' is hailed as Squier's best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980's.\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor. In the US, the album hit #5, sold about 3 million copies and spawned the successful radio and video hits \"[[Emotions in Motion (Billy Squier song)|Emotions in Motion]]\" and especially \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks straight. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 [[Hot Space Tour]] and during his own tour for ''Emotions'' he finally became an arena headliner. British newcomer [[Def Leppard]] supported him and he helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> However, Leppard ended up soon overtaking Squier as the most famed arena act in the US.\n\n=== Career pinnacle and downfall: ''Signs of Life'' (1984) ===\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - the man behind Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the album, but Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs, thus a rather odd choice for straightforward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\nWhen ''Signs of Life'' finally came in August 1984, Squier was at the peak of his success. The album brought him his third consecutive platinum certification and debuted higher than any of his albums on Billboard 200. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", hit #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent two weeks on top of the Mainstream Rock chart, becoming his highest charting single in the US. However, Squier fell ever so quickly from the top, after the song's homoerotic video attracted negative responses from critics, fans and fellow musicians alike. Squier himself was also upset about the video, describing it \"misrepresentive\".<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered soon after the video's world premiere; Signs of Life he stopped selling out shows and on some occasions even played for half-empty stadiums. He fired both of his managers and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem to be a sellout.\n\n=== Brief resurgance and departure from Capitol (1985-1993) ===\nApart from a few shows and a new song, \"Shake Down\" for the soundtrack of the film ''[[St. Elmo's Fire]]'', Squier stayed out of the spotlight for the majority of 1985, taking some time off to prepare his next album with British producer [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]], who was known for his work with [[Nik Kershaw]], [[Gary Moore]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/billy-squier-2bd680be.html|title=Billy Squier Concert Setlists (page 12)|website=setlist.fm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://performingsongwriter.com/articles-interviews/producers-engineers/peter-collins/|title=An interview with Peter Collins|publisher=www.performingsongwriter.com}}</ref> 1986 saw the release of his fifth album ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'', which was carefully crafted but still a commercial flop. The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the most consistent inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Billy Squier song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart. It was his best charting single on both charts since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaborations \"Stronger\" and \"Tied Up\", both of which were praised. The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980's hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled All Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as the fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\", were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n=== Later career (1994-) ===\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|date=February 18, 1998|newspaper=The New York Times|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on a concert tour that was his first bigger one since the 1991 tour for ''Creatures of Habit.''\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\". Squier's best selling album, 1981's [[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|''Don't Say No'']] is considered a landmark release within the arena rock genre and bridging the gap between power pop and hard rock.\n\nDescribed as a personification of early 80's rock music,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Fz2GbraVXhcpXnoi2Oe1r|title=Billy Squier|website=Spotify|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> Squier's most successful period ranges from 1981 to 1984, during which he scored five Top 10 Mainstream Rock hits (two of which were number ones), two Top 20 singles and three consecutive platinum selling albums, along with cyclic MTV rotation and radio airplay. Despite largely falling out from favour and chart success after the release of the critically panned music video for his 1984 hit \"Rock Me Tonite\", Squier has kept his presence on the rock radio up to this day and attracted strong cult following, with his music being featured on many films and video games. Squier stepped out of music business after the release of his 1993 release ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'', but he has continued performing smaller tours and occasional one-off performances.\n\nHis 1980 song \"The Big Beat\" is one of the most sampled drum breaks ever, being used by artists such as [[Run-DMC]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Jay-Z]], [[UTFO]] and [[Dizzee Rascal]], to name a few. \"The Stroke\" has also shared its fair amount of sampling, most notably in [[Eminem]]'s 2013 hit \"[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life and first bands (1950-1975) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as another story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971.\n\n=== Piper and solo career startoff (1975-1980) ===\nSquier had a short stint with a band called Sidewinders, but his first real experience with music industry occured when he left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait.'' The band was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper was managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Squier served both as the main songwriter and frontman of the group, whose style shared similarities with power pop acts such as [[Cheap Trick]] and [[The Knack]], who were enjoying great success at the time.\n\nDespite receiving moderate success at the local rock scene, Piper broke up. Squier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (who has previously had short jobs in [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success: ''Don't Say No'' and ''Emotions in Motion'' (1981-1983) ===\nFollowing a small but fairly successful summer tour with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1980, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack joined forces to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which attracted rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-ups each. The album also featured \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", which became a radio favourite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the b-side for \"In the Dark\"). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straightforward performance-based videos received heavy rotation. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''Don't Say No'' is hailed as Squier's best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980's.\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor. In the US, the album hit #5, sold about 3 million copies and spawned the successful radio and video hits \"[[Emotions in Motion (Billy Squier song)|Emotions in Motion]]\" and especially \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks straight. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 [[Hot Space Tour]] and during his own tour for ''Emotions'' he finally became an arena headliner. British newcomer [[Def Leppard]] supported him and he helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> However, Leppard ended up soon overtaking Squier as the most famed arena act in the US.\n\n=== Career pinnacle and downfall: ''Signs of Life'' (1984) ===\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - the man behind Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the album, but Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs, thus a rather odd choice for straightforward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\nWhen ''Signs of Life'' finally came in August 1984, Squier was at the peak of his success. The album brought him his third consecutive platinum certification and debuted higher than any of his albums on Billboard 200. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", hit #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent two weeks on top of the Mainstream Rock chart, becoming his highest charting single in the US. However, Squier fell ever so quickly from the top, after the song's homoerotic video attracted negative responses from critics, fans and fellow musicians alike. Squier himself was also upset about the video, describing it \"misrepresentive\".<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered soon after the video's world premiere; Signs of Life he stopped selling out shows and on some occasions even played for half-empty stadiums. He fired both of his managers and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem to be a sellout.\n\n=== Brief resurgance and departure from Capitol (1985-1993) ===\nApart from a few shows and a new song, \"Shake Down\" for the soundtrack of the film ''[[St. Elmo's Fire]]'', Squier stayed out of the spotlight for the majority of 1985, taking some time off to prepare his next album with British producer [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]], who was known for his work with [[Nik Kershaw]], [[Gary Moore]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/billy-squier-2bd680be.html|title=Billy Squier Concert Setlists (page 12)|website=setlist.fm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://performingsongwriter.com/articles-interviews/producers-engineers/peter-collins/|title=An interview with Peter Collins|publisher=www.performingsongwriter.com}}</ref> 1986 saw the release of his fifth album ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'', which was carefully crafted but still a commercial flop. The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the most consistent inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Billy Squier song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart. It was his best charting single on both charts since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaborations \"Stronger\" and \"Tied Up\", both of which were praised. The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980's hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled All Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as the fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\", were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n=== Later career (1994-) ===\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|date=February 18, 1998|newspaper=The New York Times|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on a concert tour that was his first bigger one since the 1991 tour for ''Creatures of Habit.''\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout!

After six weeks of round-robin matches, which saw four games not have a [[Result (cricket)#No result|result]], [[India national cricket team|India]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England cricket team|England]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] finished as the top four with [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] missing out by [[net run rate]].\n\nIn the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their respective semi-finals to qualify for the [[2019 Cricket World Cup Final|final]], which was played at [[Lord's]] in London. The final ended in a [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tie]] after the match ended with both teams scoring 241 [[run (cricket)|runs]], followed by the first [[Super Over]] in an ODI; England won the title, their first, on the boundary countback rule after the Super Over also finished level.

However, [[Babar Azam]] and [[Imam-ul-Haq]] made a partnership of 72, but Pakistan's progress was once again throttled by regular wickets, leaving them needing 46 runs from the last five overs.

Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two [[Glossary of cricket terms#D|dot balls]], Stokes first planted a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket; on the next ball, the fielder's throw deflected off Stokes' bat as he was coming back for a second run and went to the boundary for an additional four; umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded six runs for that delivery, despite the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' saying only one of the batsmen's runs should have counted towards the total as they had not crossed during the attempted second run at the moment the fielder threw the ball in.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|title=England Cricket World Cup win: 'Extra run' claims brushed off by Ashley Giles|work=BBC Sport|date=15 July 2019|access-date=4 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721111216/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The final two deliveries of the over saw England get a run each, but losing their last two wickets going for a second run each time, leaving the scores tied at 241 with Stokes left unbeaten with 84.<ref>{{cite news|first=Vic|last=Marks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|title=England win Cricket World Cup after super-over drama against New Zealand|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716093839/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|archive-date=16 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the scores tied, the match went to a [[Super Over]].

After a steady accumulation of runs, including a wide and a six, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery, Guptill hit the ball out to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one with Guptill being well short of his crease.

[[cricket]] tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC). It was hosted between 30 May to 14 July across eleven venues in [[England]] and [[Wales]] with the tournament being the fifth time that England had hosted the World Cup while for Wales it was their third.\n\nThe tournament was contested by 10 teams, a decrease from 14 teams the previous edition with the format of the tournament changing to a single round-robin group with the top four teams qualifying through to the knockout stage. After six weeks of round-robin matches, which saw four games not have a [[Result (cricket)#No result|result]], [[India national cricket team|India]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England cricket team|England]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] finished as the top four with [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] missing out by [[net run rate]].\n\nIn the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their respective semi-finals to qualify for the [[2019 Cricket World Cup Final|final]], which was played at [[Lord's]] in London. The final ended in a [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tie]] after the match ended with both teams scoring 241 [[run (cricket)|runs]], followed by the first [[Super Over]] in an ODI; England won the title, their first, on the boundary countback rule after the Super Over also finished level. Overall, approximately 2.6&nbsp;billion people around the world watched the tournament, making it the most-watched cricket competition {{as of|2019|lc=y|post=.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/1277987|title=ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2019 shatters audience records|publisher=International Cricket Council|date=12 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715174152/https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/1277987|archive-date=15 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Hosting==\nThe hosting rights were awarded in April 2006, after England and Wales withdrew their bid to host the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]], which was played in Australia and New Zealand.

However, [[Babar Azam]] and [[Imam-ul-Haq]] made a partnership of 72, but Pakistan's progress was once again throttled by regular wickets, leaving them needing 46 runs from the last five overs.

Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two [[Glossary of cricket terms#D|dot balls]], Stokes first planted a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket; on the next ball, the fielder's throw deflected off Stokes' bat as he was coming back for a second run and went to the boundary for an additional four; umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded six runs for that delivery, despite the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' saying only one of the batsmen's runs should have counted towards the total as they had not crossed during the attempted second run at the moment the fielder threw the ball in.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|title=England Cricket World Cup win: 'Extra run' claims brushed off by Ashley Giles|work=BBC Sport|date=15 July 2019|access-date=4 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721111216/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The final two deliveries of the over saw England get a run each, but losing their last two wickets going for a second run each time, leaving the scores tied at 241 with Stokes left unbeaten with 84.<ref>{{cite news|first=Vic|last=Marks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|title=England win Cricket World Cup after super-over drama against New Zealand|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716093839/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|archive-date=16 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the scores tied, the match went to a [[Super Over]].

After a steady accumulation of runs, including a wide and a six, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery, Guptill hit the ball out to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one with Guptill being well short of his crease.

Food should not only consist of pellets, so a mix of seeds and other hamster-safe ingredients is best. Treats are not important to hamster's health but will increase their trust in you if hand-fed.\n\nTreats such as sunflower seeds and yogurt drops are great for hamsters; though do be aware that yogurt drops must only be given at most once a week because of the amount of sugar in them. Any more than once a week is too much sugar for a hamster.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=26}}\n\nHamsters will drink up to 10ml of water for every 100g of hamster bodyweight.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=26}} Nursing mother hamsters will want extra water.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=26}} It can be difficult to provide fresh water to hamsters in a water dish because they are likely to soil the dish with bedding and need it changed twice daily.{{sfn|Logsdail|2002|p=30}} Water bowls are very easy to clean, and have a very natural drinking angle.  Water bottles in cages must be positioned at a height which the hamster can reach without stretching.\n\nHamsters hoard their food, and will carry it from where they find it to a hiding place.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=26}} They seem to not care whether their food is served in a dish or placed on their floor.{{sfn|Logsdail|2002|p=19}} Uneaten fresh vegetables should be removed after a day or so to prevent rot.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=19}}\n\n==Handling==\n[[File:Hamster-sirio.jpg|thumb|Holding a Syrian hamster]]\nHamsters that are frequently and gently handled will learn to respond peacefully to being handled. However, enforcing trust by taming is very important. {{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=20}} When hamsters bite, they bite in front of them.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=21}} A typical hamster-holding technique is to grasp the hamster from above around its belly with a thumb and the third finger.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=21}} With two hands, a hamster may be cupped and held while left free to walk on the palms.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=21}}  Sleeping hamsters often bite when disturbed.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=20}} Allow a hamster several days to become familiar with its new home, and you. Then, gently offer it treats, which it will shortly take from your palm, beginning its willingness to be handled.<ref>{{cite web |title=Taming a Hamster! |url=http://www.yourpethamster.com/care/taming |website=Your Pet Hamster |publisher=Your Pet Hamster |accessdate=16 December 2019 |ref=16}}</ref>\n\nIt is important for a pet\u2019s safety that owners know hamsters will jump from any platform without regard for height or consideration for their wellbeing.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=20}}\n\nHamsters are less likely to bite a bare hand than a gloved one.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=20}} If a hamster seems like it might bite, but must be handled, it may be collected by allowing it to explore a can or jar.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=20}}\n\n==Exercise wheels==\n{{Main article|Hamster wheel}}\n\n'''TVT''' (Tier\u00e4rztliche Vereinigung f\u00fcr Tierschutz) recommend wheels should be at least '''30cm for [[Syrian Hamster]]s,''' since smaller diameters lead to permanent spinal curvatures, especially in young animals.

The cage should also provide a sheltering structure for sleeping; this can be as simple as an opaque tube closed at one end.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Veillette|first=M.|year= 2011|title=Shelter choice by Syrian hamsters (''Mesocricetus auratus'') in the laboratory| url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Shelter-choice-by-Syrian-hamsters-(-Mesocricetus-)-Veillette-Reebs/f1c08134c941b19529f3a42b4b0c0c24d5fcf2e5|journal= Animal Welfare |volume=20|pages= 603\u2013611|last2=Reebs|first2=S.G.}}</ref>\n\n==Environment==\n\nHamsters should experience light for 12\u201316 hours a day.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=16}} Among other health effects, daily exposure to light influences the [[estrous cycle]] of females and hamsters thrive with regular light.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=16}} Hamsters prefer [[humidity]] levels of 40-60%.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=16}}<ref>This is the same as the human comfort level.</ref> Breeding hamsters prefer a room temperature between {{convert|69|F|C}} and {{convert|71|F|C}}, whereas hamsters who are not breeding prefer between {{convert|72|F|C}} and {{convert|74|F|C}}.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=16}} Hamsters prefer quiet rooms and become stressed when sudden noise disturbs them.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=22}}\n\n==Diet==\n[[File:Mesocricetus auratus -pet hamster-8a.jpg|thumb|Syrian hamster eating corn]]\nIn the wild hamsters are omnivorous but mostly eat plants.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=24}}\n\nFor domesticated hamster researchers design diets to maximize growth, breeding, milk production in mothers, and the maintenance of health in adult hamsters.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=24}} The diet of the hamster is less studied than the diet of other laboratory rodents.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=24}} A typical nutrient recommendation for a hamster diet is 17-23% [[Protein (nutrient)|crude protein]], 4.5% crude [[fat]], and 6-8% [[Dietary fiber|crude fiber]].{{sfn|Field|1999|p=25}} Hamster diet must include [[Vitamin E]].{{sfn|Field|1999|p=25}} Vegetables which are good for hamsters include cucumber, carrots, celery, kale, and lettuce (however iceberg lettuce isn't good for a hamster).{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=19}} Apples are an appropriate fruit to offer.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=19}} Domestic hamsters begin to eat food pellets when they are 7\u201310 days old.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=25}} Every day adult hamsters eat 7-15 grams of the food. Food should not only consist of pellets, so a mix of seeds and other hamster-safe ingredients is best. Treats are not important to hamster's health but will increase their trust in you if hand-fed.\n\nTreats such as sunflower seeds and yogurt drops are great for hamsters; though do be aware that yogurt drops must only be given at most once a week because of the amount of sugar in them. Any more than once a week is too much sugar for a hamster.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=26}}\n\nHamsters will drink up to 10ml of water for every 100g of hamster bodyweight.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=26}} Nursing mother hamsters will want extra water.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=26}} It can be difficult to provide fresh water to hamsters in a water dish because they are likely to soil the dish with bedding and need it changed twice daily.{{sfn|Logsdail|2002|p=30}} Water bowls are very easy to clean, and have a very natural drinking angle.  Water bottles in cages must be positioned at a height which the hamster can reach without stretching.\n\nHamsters hoard their food, and will carry it from where they find it to a hiding place.{{sfn|Field|1999|p=26}} They seem to not care whether their food is served in a dish or placed on their floor.{{sfn|Logsdail|2002|p=19}} Uneaten fresh vegetables should be removed after a day or so to prevent rot.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=19}}\n\n==Handling==\n[[File:Hamster-sirio.jpg|thumb|Holding a Syrian hamster]]\nHamsters that are frequently and gently handled will learn to respond peacefully to being handled. However, enforcing trust by taming is very important. {{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=20}} When hamsters bite, they bite in front of them.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=21}} A typical hamster-holding technique is to grasp the hamster from above around its belly with a thumb and the third finger.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=21}} With two hands, a hamster may be cupped and held while left free to walk on the palms.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=21}}  Sleeping hamsters often bite when disturbed.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=20}} Allow a hamster several days to become familiar with its new home, and you. Then, gently offer it treats, which it will shortly take from your palm, beginning its willingness to be handled.<ref>{{cite web |title=Taming a Hamster! |url=http://www.yourpethamster.com/care/taming |website=Your Pet Hamster |publisher=Your Pet Hamster |accessdate=16 December 2019 |ref=16}}</ref>\n\nIt is important for a pet\u2019s safety that owners know hamsters will jump from any platform without regard for height or consideration for their wellbeing.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=20}}\n\nHamsters are less likely to bite a bare hand than a gloved one.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=20}} If a hamster seems like it might bite, but must be handled, it may be collected by allowing it to explore a can or jar.{{sfn|Magalhaes|1968|p=20}}\n\n==Exercise Wheels==\n{{Main article|Hamster wheel}}\n\n'''TVT''' (Tier\u00e4rztliche Vereinigung f\u00fcr Tierschutz) recommend wheels should be at least '''30cm for [[Syrian Hamster]]s,''' since smaller diameters lead to permanent spinal curvatures, especially in young animals.

Price. Notable projects included the first general store, Flagler State Bank, and the Hotel Flagler built in 1909. The hotel has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior; it later became the Flagler Hospital, a private hospital headed by W.L. McBride. W.H. was President of the Flager State Bank, held the office of Commissioner of Kit Carson County from 1893 to 1895, and served as Postmaster of Flager from 1889 to 1894. His wife, Louelia Isabel \"Ella\" (n\u00e9e Van Heusen) Lavington, had the first child born in Flager. Ella worked alongside W.H. and served on the School Board of Education for Flagler County Public Schools.\n*Leon Edward Lavington, Sr., was the first child born in Flager to William Henry \u201cW.H.\u201d and Louella Isabel \u201cElla\u201d (n\u00e9e Van Heusen) Lavington. He graduated from the University of Colorado in 1915 before entering the United States WWI Draft Registration of 1917. When the town was incorporated, he was the first Mayor of Flager, and served as President of the First National Bank of Flagler (previously the Flagler State Bank). Initially appointed by Governor McNichols to a civil service commission, Leon was elected State Purchasing Agent, Auditor of the State, and Colorado State Treasurer before running for Governor (R 1946). The third largest blizzard in recorded state history preceded the gubernatorial election which resulted in a less than 30 percent voter turn-out (Historical Blizzard, November 2\u20134, 1946, 30.4 inches). Leon lost the election by a small margin having won nearly 48 percent of the vote. Lavington Park is named in his honor. His wife, Marjorie (n\u00e9e Dixon) Lavington, graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder, class 1914 and [[Pi Beta Phi]] member, also served as a Former Chairman of the Red Cross Gray Ladies of Denver.\n*Leon Edward Lavington, Jr. was former City Councilman and Mayor of Flager. He was a track star and lettered in football at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1935, 1936, and 1937 (#17, Defensive End). He played in the University's first \u201cbowl\u201d game appearance, during the 1938 Cotton Bowl against Rice University. In 1938, Leon and teammates, United States Supreme Court Justice Byron \u201cWhizzer\u201d White and Gene Moore, were drafted by the National Football League (NFL). They were the first players in the history of the University of Colorado to have been drafted. Leon was chosen by the Chicago Cardinals (Draft: Round 8, #65 Overall, End Position). His children, grandchildren, and extended family continue the multi-generational tradition as CU Boulder alumni and engage in public service throughout Colorado.\n\n==See

Price. Notable projects included the first general store, Flagler State Bank, and the Hotel Flagler built in 1909. The hotel has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior; it later became the Flagler Hospital, a private hospital headed by W.L. McBride. W.H. was President of the Flager State Bank, held the office of Commissioner of Kit Carson County from 1893 to 1895, and served as Postmaster of Flager from 1889 to 1894. His wife, Louelia Isabel \"Ella\" (n\u00e9e Van Heusen) Lavington, had the first child born in Flager. Ella worked alongside W.H. and served on the School Board of Education for Flagler County Public Schools.\n*Leon Edward Lavington, Sr., was the first child born in Flager to William Henry \u201cW.H.\u201d and Louella Isabel \u201cElla\u201d (n\u00e9e Van Heusen) Lavington. He graduated from the University of Colorado in 1915 before entering the United States WWI Draft Registration of 1917. When the town was incorporated, he was the first Mayor of Flager, and served as President of the First National Bank of Flagler (previously the Flagler State Bank). Initially appointed by Governor McNichols to a civil service commission, Leon was elected State Purchasing Agent, Auditor of the State, and Colorado State Treasurer before running for Governor (R 1946). The third largest blizzard in recorded state history preceded the gubernatorial election which resulted in a less than 30 percent voter turn-out (Historical Blizzard, November 2\u20134, 1946, 30.4 inches). Leon lost the election by a small margin having won nearly 48 percent of the vote. Lavington Park is named in his honor. His wife, Marjorie (n\u00e9e Dixon) Lavington, graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder, class 1914 and [[Pi Beta Phi]] member, also served as a Former Chairman of the Red Cross Gray Ladies of Denver.\n*Leon Edward Lavington, Jr. was former City Councilman and Mayor of Flager. He was a track star and lettered in football at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1935, 1936, and 1937 (#17, Defensive End). He played in the University's first \u201cbowl\u201d game appearance, during the 1938 Cotton Bowl against Rice University. In 1938, Leon and teammates, United States Supreme Court Justice Byron \u201cWhizzer\u201d White and Gene Moore, were drafted by the National Football League (NFL). They were the first players in the history of the University of Colorado to have been drafted. Leon was chosen by the Chicago Cardinals (Draft: Round 8, #65 Overall, End Position). His children, grandchildren, and extended family continue the multi-generational tradition as CU Boulder alumni and engage in public service throughout Colorado.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Geography|North America|<!--Northern America-->|United States|Colorado}}\n*[[Outline of Colorado]]\n**[[Index of Colorado-related articles]]\n*[[State of Colorado]]\n**[[Colorado cities and towns]]\n***[[Colorado municipalities]]\n**[[Colorado counties]]\n***[[Kit Carson County, Colorado]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://flaglercolorado.com/ Official town website]\n*[http://dtdapps.coloradodot.info/staticdata/Downloads/CityMaps/FLAGLER.pdf CDOT map of the Town of Flagler]\n\n{{Kit Carson County, Colorado}}\n{{Colorado|show}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Kit Carson County, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Towns in Colorado]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1888]]\n[[Category:1888 establishments in Colorado]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagler,_Colorado"}

After unsuccessfully attempting to receive a loan from Lucille Austero, the primary shareholder in what is now the Austero-Bluth Company who is running for a congressional seat, Michael moves in with his son George Michael in his dorm at the [[UC Irvine]], while himself enrolling in [[University of Phoenix]]. George Michael, who is working on 'Fakeblock' software with his other roommate Paul, which George Michael explains is a privacy software, is uncomfortable with Michael's presence. When Michael's scheme to kick Paul out of the dorm fails, George Michael, Paul, and a visiting Maeby vote Michael out of the dorm. A disappointed and confused Michael goes to the airport, where he attempts to buy an in-flight magazine which features an article about him, but is forced to buy a plane ticket. He is later saddened when he finds out the article portrays him as a failed businessman. He returns home to Newport Beach, planning to take up residence in his mother's vacant apartment, and is surprised to find the apartment has been trashed.

However, George Sr. is mainly using the property to prevent the land from going into the possession of Stan Sitwell, who George and Lucille discover is trying to build a wall on the U.S. border for the government to keep out Mexican immigrants (an idea that had originally been Lucille's but that Sitwell has stolen), despite George originally mistaking it for a monument to [[George W. Bush]]. Subsequently, George Sr. continues to lie to his brother by telling Oscar that he is using the property entirely for the business venture. In order to build the wall, George Sr. and Lucille must separate their assets so they decide to fake a divorce while secretly rekindling their sexual relations. Eventually, Oscar learns the truth from Barry Zuckerkorn, who mistakes him for George Sr, and gets revenge on his brother by sleeping with Lucille while George Sr. learns he will have to bribe the right-wing politician Herbert Love, Lucille Austero's congressional opponent, to support construction of the wall.\n |LineColor = 3A5978\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Arrested Development (season 4)\n |MainList = List of Arrested Development episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 56\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Indian Takers\n |Aux1 = [[List of Arrested Development characters#Lindsay Bluth|Lindsay]]\n |DirectedBy = Mitchell Hurwitz & Troy Miller\n |WrittenBy = Caroline Williams & [[Dean Lorey]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2013|5|26}}\n |ProdCode = 4AJD05\n |ShortSummary = At the harbormaster's lounge after the boat party, Lindsay Bluth breaks off her marriage with her husband Tobias.

Eventually she runs out of money and decides to return, retaining advice from a shaman that told her \"love is where you left it\". Taking that as advice to reconcile with Tobias, she decides to try harder at their marriage and agrees to be a character witness at Lucille's trial in order to pay for a new house for them, which is a lavish mansion after meeting with a predatory realtor. Because of her increasing difficulty with the outlandish script that Lucille has written about being a good mother, Lindsay agrees to go to a method acting class with Tobias. Due to a misunderstanding, this ends up being a methadone clinic. On a double date with two patients from the clinic, Lindsay falls for activist Marky Bark and runs off with him. After a whirlwind night of dancing and mediocre sex, in which she breaks up with Tobias, Lindsay wakes up at Marky's ostrich farm he shares with his mother, where she is frustrated with herself for listening to the shaman.\n |LineColor = 3A5978\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Arrested Development (season 4)\n |MainList = List of Arrested Development episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 57\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = The B.

Kitty Sanchez, George Sr.'s former assistant, now works at the studio as a producer, after betraying Maeby's lack of a high school diploma to steal her job. In exchange for the rights to Michael's \"inspiring father/son story\", Ron agrees to make him a producer on the project. When Ron mentions his daughter \"his girl\" Rebel Alley, who Ron believes would be perfect for the part of Michael's wife, Michael mistakenly assumes that Rebel is Ron's mistress. Although at first reluctant to participate in the movie and not wanting to become involved with his father again, Michael commits to the idea after using his business card (which lists him as an executive producer) to flirt with a struggling actress/musician ([[Isla Fisher]]) whom he literally bumps into on the street.  After a fight with his father, Michael procrastinates his job securing the rights by attempting to cast actors for the movie ([[Carl Weathers]] and [[Andy Richter]]), and hiring George's prison warden as a screenwriter ([[James Lipton]]). Learning about Michael's selfish motive to become a producer to impress a girl, who Michael doesn't actually know the name of, George reconciles with Michael and agrees to sign over his movie rights.  However, Michael learns from Ron that the father/son story he is interested in is actually the story of Michael and George Michael.

Finding his wife's copy of ''Eat, Pray, Love'', Tobias is also inspired to go to India, and ends up booking a trip to the same city Lindsay did. Despite traveling on the same flight and other close encounters, neither Tobias or Lindsay are aware of each other being there. Hospitalized due to a bus accident, a comment from an Indian doctor that he should be in comedies motivates Tobias to try again to become an actor and he returns to California. At his method acting class, actually a methadone clinic, he befriends a patient named DeBrie who he thinks is an actress. After a double-date with Lindsay and Marky Bark, DeBrie learns that Tobias is a doctor and can write drug prescriptions (\"scrips\" for short). After a kiss, the two run off together and pathetically attempt to make it as [[Fantastic Four]]-themed street performers. After Tobias saves Lucille 2 from an ostrich attack, she offers him a job at her rehab clinic, which has a starting salary of $120,000 a year, but Tobias turns it out to try to keep his and DeBrie's \"dream\" alive. DeBrie is upset by this and leaves Tobias. Depressed once more, Tobias tries to meet Maeby while still in his [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] costume.

As George Sr. attempts to get the wall's building cancelled through Michael's connections and struggles with new feelings of extreme emotion and delicacy, his twin brother Oscar schemes against him by sleeping with Lucille and threatening to reveal his role in the \"Sweat and Squeeze\" scheme. Meanwhile, Michael is afraid that if he calls George-Michael about acquiring his movie rights, he will be once more intruding upon his life but after an encounter with Gob in the model home, Gob offers to call George-Michael for him.

Gob plans to disappear inside a cave and re-appear after three days but this goes wrong when his secret compartment fails to open and Gob is knocked unconscious and trapped inside a hollow boulder, being found days later in the back of a storage unit. After Ann announces that she is leaving him, Gob re-connects with his son Steve Holt who offers him a job. Gob fails to show up the next day after falling in with a group of celebrities led by singer Mark Cherry. Shamed by this new lifestyle, Gob falls into a cycle of taking 'Forget-me-now' pills which make him forget that he took the last pill but not the events that resulted in him taking the pill, eventually ending up in a Mexican hospital. After his sick bees hospitalize the whole of Gob's gang when they escape into the back of his limo, Gob takes a job at his father's \"Sweat and Squeeze\" camp where he unexpectedly discovers the cave he used for the illusion at the wedding.

Encountering Michael, Lindsay agrees to hand over her movie rights and talk to Herbert about the wall in exchange for Michael's help to release Marky. Michael meanwhile is hurt when George-Michael both doesn't show up to the meeting arranged by Gob and lies to him about his reasons for not being there. When Lindsay discovers Marky has been released from jail with Michael's help and he asks her to assist his plan to blow-up Herbert Love's boat at Cinco de Cuatro, she plans to tell Love about Marky's plans.

In prison, Lucille joins a gang of Chinese women called the Jade Triad, and rises to the top of the gang when she shows them a loophole around the 'No Smoking' rule but they turn on her when she causes trouble among the Triad members. Fearing for her life, Lucille gets herself transferred out of the prison to Lucille Austero's clinic where Tobias becomes her therapist. Lucille at first refuses to try therapy but when Tobias accidentally calls her a 'villain', she rants furiously at him and accepts a part as the villain of his Fantastic Four musical.

Tony, who is also pretending to be gay as part of a scheme with Sally Sitwell to acquire Gob's phone and retrieve the Fakeblock software from Gob's 'boyfriend' George-Michael, agrees to another date with Gob at the Little Ballroom. However, both Gob and Tony seem to be falling in love with each other for real. The next day, Gob goes to the wrong Little Ballroom where he encounters Michael who has been tailing him, believing him to be Rebel's boyfriend. The two fight and Michael kicks Gob, Lucille and George Sr. out of the movie in frustration at his family. Gob goes to Tony Wonder to apologize and the two spend an evening together, becoming close friends and realizing that they may be falling for each other, and agree to have sex on the night of Cinco de Cuatro. Gob arrives at Cinco first and encounters Ann, who reveals she has a five-year-old child with Tony Wonder, and Gob realizes Tony has just been pretending to be gay.

However, when she attends the ceremony with George-Michael, she realizes that the award is only given to those who are dead or whose careers are dying. Seeking to revive her career, she announces that she is creating an Internet company using George-Michael's 'Fakeblock' software, despite his objections. With investors pouring in money for the idea, Maeby also successfully pimps her mother out to Herbert Love for money and schemes to incriminate her boyfriend Perfecto, whom she believes to be her high school's undercover cop, as a sexual predator. George-Michael, realizing that 'Fakeblock' is rapidly spinning out of his control, fires Maeby from the company in a fit of panic.

After Cinco de Cuatro, as Lucille Austero is revealed to be missing and Sally Sitwell taking over her campaign, Maeby is arrested as a sex offender by her algebra teacher Donnie Richter, who is actually the undercover cop Rocky Richter, and realizes that she will have to live in Sudden Valley, which Gob has filled with sex offenders, as the neighborhood fits all the criteria for a sex offender to live in.\n |LineColor = 3A5978\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Arrested Development (season 4)\n |MainList = List of Arrested Development episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 66\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 13\n |Title = It Gets Better\n |Aux1 =  [[List of Arrested Development characters#George Michael Bluth|George-Michael]] <!-- EPISODES 13 AND 15 TITLE SEQUENCES CREDIT MICHAEL CERA AS \"GEORGE-MICHAEL BLUTH\" WITH A HYPHEN -->\n |DirectedBy = Troy Miller & Mitchell Hurwitz\n |WrittenBy = Dean Lorey & Richard Rosenstock\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2013|5|26}}\n |ProdCode = 4AJD12\n |ShortSummary = In the years since Season 3 ended, George-Michael has entered college at the [[University of California, Irvine]] and, after a few formative years there (as well as a wild sexual romp while studying abroad in Spain), he goes through life with a new sense of confidence and has shed much of his meekness.  He and roommate Paul develop an app for an electronic woodblock, christening it 'Fakeblock'. In an attempt to seduce Maeby and impress Michael, George-Michael lies about 'Fakeblock', claiming that it is anti-piracy software. When Maeby uses George-Michael's idea to form an Internet company, he goes along with the lie to show her that he is a risk-taker, adopting the pseudonym 'George Maharis'. But as he discovers that Maeby has managed to start a real company with money from investors, he realizes that his white lie has rapidly evolved beyond his control and turned into a scam which he has inadvertently become the center of, and he starts looking for a way to close the company as quickly as possible. However, at a planned meeting with his father Michael he accidentally encounters Rebel, who is impressed by his new celebrity status, and lies to Michael so that he might spend more time with Rebel.

On a search for a new mother after Lucille Bluth disowns him, Buster moves in with Lucille Austero but she soon kicks him out for being more of a son than a lover. Buster, with nowhere else to go, re-enlists with the army to try and capture his real mother's attention, and is assigned to be a drone pilot. Buster believes he is playing a video game, and becomes skilled at the job. When he learns he is hurting real people, he suffers a panic attack and ends up injuring himself. Buster is taken to the hospital where he receives an over-sized and overly powerful left hand replacement. Buster is told by a doctor that with his powerful hand, he'll be used in battle by the army. Subsequently, he begins to deliberately fail his tests, which are being used so he gains control of his new large hand). Buster then fails the \"Cute Test\", (not killing an adorable kitten, showing he has control of his hand), he is discharged from the army. Buster is adopted by Ophelia Love, the wife of Herbert Love, to support Herbert's campaign as an injured war veteran. However, Ophelia begins an affair with Buster when she learns about Herbert's infidelity and then abruptly ends it, choosing to give Herbert a second chance, and kicks Buster out. Buster goes to Cinco de Cuatro seeking revenge against Herbert Love but runs into Lucille Austero, who reveals that she deliberately gave him juice the night before his mother's trial so that Lucille Bluth would be locked up. Horrified, Buster goes on a juice-fueled rampage, knocking Herbert Love into a coma. After accidentally incriminating himself into Lucille Austero's disappearance, Buster attempts and fails to use George-Michael's 'Fakeblock' software to erase the footage.\n |LineColor = 3A5978\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Arrested Development (season 4)\n |MainList = List of Arrested Development episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 68\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 15\n |Title =  Blockheads\n |Aux1 = George-Michael <!-- EPISODES 13 AND 15 TITLE SEQUENCES CREDIT MICHAEL CERA AS \"GEORGE-MICHAEL BLUTH\" WITH A HYPHEN -->\n |DirectedBy = Mitchell Hurwitz & Troy Miller\n |WrittenBy = Mitchell Hurwitz & Jim Vallely\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2013|5|26}}\n |ProdCode = 4AJD13\n |ShortSummary = Due to increasing animosity with his roommate Paul over the ownership of 'Fakeblock', George-Michael is voted out of his dorm room. George-Michael runs into Gob. Gob is able to sell a Sudden Valley home to George-Michael, who buys the house so his father will be proud of him. Rebel visits George-Michael and starts doubting their relationship, seeing the investment in real estate as a sign that George-Michael is not as easy-going as he claimed. Maeby, meanwhile, wanting revenge on George-Michael for firing her, advises Michael on how to impress Rebel. Following her advice, Michael makes love to Rebel, but after leaving her apartment he discovers from a photo that his romantic rival is his own son. Upon accidentally running into George-Michael and hearing from him that he has girlfriend-trouble, Michael takes pity on his son and decides not to reveal the truth and gives up pursuing Rebel further. At Cinco de Cuatro, Gob is in negotiation with a Mongolian horde he hired to build the Mexican wall, but as George Sr. reveal they have no money to pay the horde with, the horde is angered and goes on a rampage, being mistaken for rioting Mexicans in the process. Somewhere else, George-Michael is preparing to reveal at his keynote speech that 'Fakeblock' doesn't exist, he finds a note that promises him he will get \"screwed\" if he continues his plans with 'Fakeblock', and thinking that it is a promise of sex from Rebel, he decides to continue the lie. But, unbeknownst to him, the note was actually a threat from the [[hacktivist]] group, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. Michael awakes the next day, and because he was drugged by Gob, he has forgotten that he decided to give up Rebel. George-Michael, meanwhile, tells Rebel that he truly cares about her and thereby solidifies their relationship. As George-Michael leaves Rebel's place, he runs into the amnesic Michael, and realizes that he was the other guy Rebel was seeing. George-Michael is willing to pass it off as an honest mistake, until Michael inadvertently mentions the photo he saw, revealing that he knew about George-Michael and Rebel's relationship. Angered, George-Michael punches his father in the face, and the two silently stare at each other. In the post-credits scene, Gob is named as the replacement President of Bluth Company after Lucille Austero disappears. Buster is arrested for the murder of Lucille Austero.

In 2006, immediately after the events of \"Development Arrested\", Lucille is arrested by the SEC after wrecking the ''Queen Mary''. Michael, George-Michael, and George Sr. return from their attempted escape due to George Sr.'s fear that Lucille will \"flip\" on him to the SEC, with Michael resuming his work as president of the Bluth Company. Three months later, Michael discovers everyone in the family has received a \"stimulus package\" except him, yet he is still expected to be the primary character witness in Lucille's defense at her upcoming trial.

Buster, now alone in the penthouse, begins acting as if Lucille is still living there, constructing a homemade life-size Lucille doll and conversing with it. At a meeting with Stan Sitwell, George Sr. spies a page of blueprints for what he believes is a \"monument to George W. Bush\" and snaps a picture of it with his phone. George Sr. shows the picture to Lucille while visiting her in prison, whereupon she deduces the plans are actually for a border wall that Sitwell is planning to build for the U.S. government. The two conspire to underbid Sitwell for the project, along with deciding to pretend to divorce until the conclusion of Lucille's trial in order to avoid arousing suspicion from the authorities.

Tobias finds Lindsay's copy of the book and decides to travel to India as well, only to end up in the hospital after getting hit by a bus. A visit to a local shaman inspires Lindsay to return home, though she is forced to make up with Tobias as a condition of Lucille\u2014who wants the entire family present at her upcoming trial\u2014paying for her return flight. While Michael continues developing Sudden Valley, Lindsay and Tobias use their \"stimulus package\" to buy an extravagant house on an adjustable rate mortgage. As Lindsay prepares her testimony for Lucille's trial (in exchange for money from Lucille), Tobias attempts to revive his acting career, with little success.

The economic downturn causes the government to put the border wall project on hold, leading George Sr. to panic, as he is now unable to make the payments on the land he has purchased.

After unsuccessfully attempting to receive a loan from Lucille Austero, the primary shareholder in what is now the Austero-Bluth Company who is running for a congressional seat, Michael moves in with his son George Michael in his dorm at the [[UC Irvine]], while himself enrolling in [[University of Phoenix]]. George Michael, who is working on 'Fakeblock' software with his other roommate Paul, which George Michael explains is a privacy software, is uncomfortable with Michael's presence. When Michael's scheme to kick Paul out of the dorm fails, George Michael, Paul, and a visiting Maeby vote Michael out of the dorm. A disappointed and confused Michael goes to the airport, where he attempts to buy an in-flight magazine which features an article about him, but is forced to buy a plane ticket. He is later saddened when he finds out the article portrays him as a failed businessman. He returns home to Newport Beach, planning to take up residence in his mother's vacant apartment, and is surprised to find the apartment has been trashed.

However, George Sr. is mainly using the property to prevent the land from going into the possession of Stan Sitwell, who George and Lucille discover is trying to build a wall on the U.S. border for the government to keep out Mexican immigrants (an idea that had originally been Lucille's but that Sitwell has stolen), despite George originally mistaking it for a monument to [[George W. Bush]]. Subsequently, George Sr. continues to lie to his brother by telling Oscar that he is using the property entirely for the business venture. In order to build the wall, George Sr. and Lucille must separate their assets so they decide to fake a divorce while secretly rekindling their sexual relations. Eventually, Oscar learns the truth from Barry Zuckerkorn, who mistakes him for George Sr, and gets revenge on his brother by sleeping with Lucille while George Sr. learns he will have to bribe the right-wing politician Herbert Love, Lucille Austero's congressional opponent, to support construction of the wall.\n |LineColor = 3A5978\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Arrested Development (season 4)\n |MainList = List of Arrested Development episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 56\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Indian Takers\n |Aux1 = [[List of Arrested Development characters#Lindsay Bluth|Lindsay]]\n |DirectedBy = Mitchell Hurwitz & Troy Miller\n |WrittenBy = Caroline Williams & [[Dean Lorey]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2013|5|26}}\n |ProdCode = 4AJD05\n |ShortSummary = At the harbormaster's lounge after the boat party, Lindsay Bluth breaks off her marriage with her husband Tobias.

Eventually she runs out of money and decides to return, retaining advice from a shaman that told her \"love is where you left it\". Taking that as advice to reconcile with Tobias, she decides to try harder at their marriage and agrees to be a character witness at Lucille's trial in order to pay for a new house for them, which is a lavish mansion after meeting with a predatory realtor. Because of her increasing difficulty with the outlandish script that Lucille has written about being a good mother, Lindsay agrees to go to a method acting class with Tobias. Due to a misunderstanding, this ends up being a methadone clinic. On a double date with two patients from the clinic, Lindsay falls for activist Marky Bark and runs off with him. After a whirlwind night of dancing and mediocre sex, in which she breaks up with Tobias, Lindsay wakes up at Marky's ostrich farm he shares with his mother, where she is frustrated with herself for listening to the shaman.\n |LineColor = 3A5978\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Arrested Development (season 4)\n |MainList = List of Arrested Development episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 57\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = The B.

Kitty Sanchez, George Sr.'s former assistant, now works at the studio as a producer, after betraying Maeby's lack of a high school diploma to steal her job. In exchange for the rights to Michael's \"inspiring father/son story\", Ron agrees to make him a producer on the project. When Ron mentions his daughter \"his girl\" Rebel Alley, who Ron believes would be perfect for the part of Michael's wife, Michael mistakenly assumes that Rebel is Ron's mistress. Although at first reluctant to participate in the movie and not wanting to become involved with his father again, Michael commits to the idea after using his business card (which lists him as an executive producer) to flirt with a struggling actress/musician ([[Isla Fisher]]) whom he literally bumps into on the street.  After a fight with his father, Michael procrastinates his job securing the rights by attempting to cast actors for the movie ([[Carl Weathers]] and [[Andy Richter]]), and hiring George's prison warden as a screenwriter ([[James Lipton]]). Learning about Michael's selfish motive to become a producer to impress a girl, who Michael doesn't actually know the name of, George reconciles with Michael and agrees to sign over his movie rights.  However, Michael learns from Ron that the father/son story he is interested in is actually the story of Michael and George Michael.

Finding his wife's copy of ''Eat, Pray, Love'', Tobias is also inspired to go to India, and ends up booking a trip to the same city Lindsay did. Despite traveling on the same flight and other close encounters, neither Tobias or Lindsay are aware of each other being there. Hospitalized due to a bus accident, a comment from an Indian doctor that he should be in comedies motivates Tobias to try again to become an actor and he returns to California. At his method acting class, actually a methadone clinic, he befriends a patient named DeBrie who he thinks is an actress. After a double-date with Lindsay and Marky Bark, DeBrie learns that Tobias is a doctor and can write drug prescriptions (\"scrips\" for short). After a kiss, the two run off together and pathetically attempt to make it as [[Fantastic Four]]-themed street performers. After Tobias saves Lucille 2 from an ostrich attack, she offers him a job at her rehab clinic, which has a starting salary of $120,000 a year, but Tobias turns it out to try to keep his and DeBrie's \"dream\" alive. DeBrie is upset by this and leaves Tobias. Depressed once more, Tobias tries to meet Maeby while still in his [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] costume.

As George Sr. attempts to get the wall's building cancelled through Michael's connections and struggles with new feelings of extreme emotion and delicacy, his twin brother Oscar schemes against him by sleeping with Lucille and threatening to reveal his role in the \"Sweat and Squeeze\" scheme. Meanwhile, Michael is afraid that if he calls George-Michael about acquiring his movie rights, he will be once more intruding upon his life but after an encounter with Gob in the model home, Gob offers to call George-Michael for him.

Gob plans to disappear inside a cave and re-appear after three days but this goes wrong when his secret compartment fails to open and Gob is knocked unconscious and trapped inside a hollow boulder, being found days later in the back of a storage unit. After Ann announces that she is leaving him, Gob re-connects with his son Steve Holt who offers him a job. Gob fails to show up the next day after falling in with a group of celebrities led by singer Mark Cherry. Shamed by this new lifestyle, Gob falls into a cycle of taking 'Forget-me-now' pills which make him forget that he took the last pill but not the events that resulted in him taking the pill, eventually ending up in a Mexican hospital. After his sick bees hospitalize the whole of Gob's gang when they escape into the back of his limo, Gob takes a job at his father's \"Sweat and Squeeze\" camp where he unexpectedly discovers the cave he used for the illusion at the wedding.

Encountering Michael, Lindsay agrees to hand over her movie rights and talk to Herbert about the wall in exchange for Michael's help to release Marky. Michael meanwhile is hurt when George-Michael both doesn't show up to the meeting arranged by Gob and lies to him about his reasons for not being there. When Lindsay discovers Marky has been released from jail with Michael's help and he asks her to assist his plan to blow-up Herbert Love's boat at Cinco de Cuatro, she plans to tell Love about Marky's plans.

In prison, Lucille joins a gang of Chinese women called the Jade Triad, and rises to the top of the gang when she shows them a loophole around the 'No Smoking' rule but they turn on her when she causes trouble among the Triad members. Fearing for her life, Lucille gets herself transferred out of the prison to Lucille Austero's clinic where Tobias becomes her therapist.

Tony, who is also pretending to be gay as part of a scheme with Sally Sitwell to acquire Gob's phone and retrieve the Fakeblock software from Gob's 'boyfriend' George-Michael, agrees to another date with Gob at the Little Ballroom. However, both Gob and Tony seem to be falling in love with each other for real. The next day, Gob goes to the wrong Little Ballroom where he encounters Michael who has been tailing him, believing him to be Rebel's boyfriend. The two fight and Michael kicks Gob, Lucille and George Sr. out of the movie in frustration at his family. Gob goes to Tony Wonder to apologize and the two spend an evening together, becoming close friends and realizing that they may be falling for each other, and agree to have sex on the night of Cinco de Cuatro. Gob arrives at Cinco first and encounters Ann, who reveals she has a five-year-old child with Tony Wonder, and Gob realizes Tony has just been pretending to be gay.

George-Michael, realizing that 'Fakeblock' is rapidly spinning out of his control, fires Maeby from the company in a fit of panic. Maeby proceeds to sleep with Perfecto, who believes her to be 17, and attends Cinco de Cuatro to obtain her latest payment from Herbert Love's aide. When Love calls off relations with Lindsay, Maeby asks Perfecto to 'bad cop' Love for her. With Love 'taken care of' by Perfecto, he also reveals to Maeby that he's not an undercover cop and is just 17. After Cinco de Cuatro, as Lucille Austero is revealed to be missing and Sally Sitwell taking over her campaign, Maeby is arrested as a sex offender by her algebra teacher Donnie Richter, who is actually the undercover cop Rocky Richter, and realizes that she will have to live in Sudden Valley, which Gob has filled with sex offenders, as the neighborhood fits all the criteria for a sex offender to live in.\n |LineColor = 3A5978\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Arrested Development (season 4)\n |MainList = List of Arrested Development episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 66\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 13\n |Title = It Gets Better\n |Aux1 =  [[List of Arrested Development characters#George Michael Bluth|George-Michael]] <!-- EPISODES 13 AND 15 TITLE SEQUENCES CREDIT MICHAEL CERA AS \"GEORGE-MICHAEL BLUTH\" WITH A HYPHEN -->\n |DirectedBy = Troy Miller & Mitchell Hurwitz\n |WrittenBy = Dean Lorey & Richard Rosenstock\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2013|5|26}}\n |ProdCode = 4AJD12\n |ShortSummary = In the years since Season 3 ended, George-Michael has entered college at the [[University of California, Irvine]] and, after a few formative years there (as well as a wild sexual romp while studying abroad in Spain), he goes through life with a new sense of confidence and has shed much of his meekness.  He and roommate Paul develop an app for an electronic woodblock, christening it 'Fakeblock'. In an attempt to seduce Maeby and impress Michael, George-Michael lies about 'Fakeblock', claiming that it is anti-piracy software. When Maeby uses George-Michael's idea to form an Internet company, he goes along with the lie to show her that he is a risk-taker, adopting the pseudonym 'George Maharis'. But as he discovers that Maeby has managed to start a real company with money from investors, he realizes that his white lie has rapidly evolved beyond his control and turned into a scam which he has inadvertently become the center of, and he starts looking for a way to close the company as quickly as possible. However, at a planned meeting with his father Michael he accidentally encounters Rebel, who is impressed by his new celebrity status, and lies to Michael so that he might spend more time with Rebel.

On a search for a new mother after Lucille Bluth disowns him, Buster moves in with Lucille Austero but she soon kicks him out for being more of a son than a lover. Buster, with nowhere else to go, re-enlists with the army to try and capture his real mother's attention, and is assigned to be a drone pilot. Buster believes he is playing a video game, and becomes skilled at the job. When he learns he is hurting real people, he suffers a panic attack and ends up injuring himself. Buster is taken to the hospital where he receives an over-sized and overly powerful left hand replacement. Buster is told by a doctor that with his powerful hand, he'll be used in battle by the army. Subsequently, he begins to deliberately fail his tests, which are being used so he gains control of his new large hand). Buster then fails the \"Cute Test\", (not killing an adorable kitten, showing he has control of his hand), he is discharged from the army. Buster is adopted by Ophelia Love, the wife of Herbert Love, to support Herbert's campaign as an injured war veteran. However, Ophelia begins an affair with Buster when she learns about Herbert's infidelity and then abruptly ends it, choosing to give Herbert a second chance, and kicks Buster out. Buster goes to Cinco de Cuatro seeking revenge against Herbert Love but runs into Lucille Austero, who reveals that she deliberately gave him juice the night before his mother's trial so that Lucille Bluth would be locked up. Horrified, Buster goes on a juice-fueled rampage, knocking Herbert Love into a coma.

George-Michael runs into Gob. Gob is able to sell a Sudden Valley home to George-Michael, who buys the house so his father will be proud of him. Rebel visits George-Michael and starts doubting their relationship, seeing the investment in real estate as a sign that George-Michael is not as easy-going as he claimed. Maeby, meanwhile, wanting revenge on George-Michael for firing her, advises Michael on how to impress Rebel. Following her advice, Michael makes love to Rebel, but after leaving her apartment he discovers from a photo that his romantic rival is his own son. Upon accidentally running into George-Michael and hearing from him that he has girlfriend-trouble, Michael takes pity on his son and decides not to reveal the truth and gives up pursuing Rebel further. At Cinco de Cuatro, Gob is in negotiation with a Mongolian horde he hired to build the Mexican wall, but as George Sr. reveal they have no money to pay the horde with, the horde is angered and goes on a rampage, being mistaken for rioting Mexicans in the process. Somewhere else, George-Michael is preparing to reveal at his keynote speech that 'Fakeblock' doesn't exist, he finds a note that promises him he will get \"screwed\" if he continues his plans with 'Fakeblock', and thinking that it is a promise of sex from Rebel, he decides to continue the lie. But, unbeknownst to him, the note was actually a threat from the [[hacktivist]] group, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. Michael awakes the next day, and because he was drugged by Gob, he has forgotten that he decided to give up Rebel. George-Michael, meanwhile, tells Rebel that he truly cares about her and thereby solidifies their relationship. As George-Michael leaves Rebel's place, he runs into the amnesic Michael, and realizes that he was the other guy Rebel was seeing. George-Michael is willing to pass it off as an honest mistake, until Michael inadvertently mentions the photo he saw, revealing that he knew about George-Michael and Rebel's relationship. Angered, George-Michael punches his father in the face, and the two silently stare at each other. In the post-credits scene, Gob is named as the replacement President of Bluth Company after Lucille Austero disappears. Buster is arrested for the murder of Lucille Austero.

Buster, now alone in the penthouse, begins acting as if Lucille is still living there, constructing a homemade life-size Lucille doll and conversing with it. At a meeting with Stan Sitwell, George Sr. spies a page of blueprints for what he believes is a \"monument to George W. Bush\" and snaps a picture of it with his phone. George Sr. shows the picture to Lucille while visiting her in prison, whereupon she deduces the plans are actually for a border wall that Sitwell is planning to build for the U.S. government. The two conspire to underbid Sitwell for the project, along with deciding to pretend to divorce until the conclusion of Lucille's trial in order to avoid arousing suspicion from the authorities.

Tobias finds Lindsay's copy of the book and decides to travel to India as well, only to end up in the hospital after getting hit by a bus. A visit to a local shaman inspires Lindsay to return home, though she is forced to make up with Tobias as a condition of Lucille\u2014who wants the entire family present at her upcoming trial\u2014paying for her return flight. While Michael continues developing Sudden Valley, Lindsay and Tobias use their \"stimulus package\" to buy an extravagant house on an adjustable rate mortgage. As Lindsay prepares her testimony for Lucille's trial (in exchange for money from Lucille), Tobias attempts to revive his acting career, with little success.

The economic downturn causes the government to put the border wall project on hold, leading George Sr. to panic, as he is now unable to make the payments on the land he has purchased.

The pacing is notably slower than during its original run and the show lacks the breathtaking density that characterized its glorious past.
