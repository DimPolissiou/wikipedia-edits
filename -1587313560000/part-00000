(2013). Plague: history and contemporary analysis. ''Journal of Infection'', ''66''(1), 18-26.</ref> There are three types of plague: bubonic, pneumonic and septicemic. Bubonic plague is the most well-known type. This type of plague results in swollen lymph nodes that are called buboes. This type of plague is treatable with antibiotics, but if not treated effectively, the infection can spread to different parts of the body. Pneumonic plague occurs when plague infects the lungs and is transmissible person to person through infected droplets. This form of plague is very deadly. Septicemic plague occurs when plague enters the blood. Skin and tissues turn black and die, and bleeding into skin and organs often occurs. This form of plague is also deadly. Pneumonic plague and septicemic plague often occur when bubonic plague goes untreated and are difficult to diagnose.<ref name=\":0\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2018). Plague. 2018.</ref>\n\n=== Endemic plague ===\nPlague has endemically resided in Madagascar since it was first brought to the island from India in 1898, on the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|central high plateau of Madagascar]], usually occurring every year as a seasonal upsurge during the rainy season.<ref name=\":2\">Andrianaivoarimanana, V., Kreppel, K., Elissa, N., Duplantier, J. M., Carniel, E., Rajerison, M., & Jambou, R. (2013). Understanding the persistence of plague foci in Madagascar. ''PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases'', ''7''(11), e2382.</ref> Plague resides in Madagascar similar to the way flu resides in the United States. \"Plague season\" is generally October through March, and mostly affects rural areas of Madagascar.<ref name=\":0\" /> Plague, although endemic, has been relatively dormant in Madagascar until 1990. Annually until then, there were about 20-30 cases reported a year. Recently, however, the annual number of cases has risen to typically between 800 and 1500 a year.<ref name=\":1\">World Health Organization (2018). Plague \u2013 Madagascar. 2018.</ref> All cases of plague must be reported to the Ministry of Health; however, cases often go underreported due to lack of quality epidemiologic resources in rural areas. Tests for plague used in these areas often have low sensitivity and are unreliable.<ref name=\":5\">Miarinjara, A., & Boyer, S. (2016). Current perspectives on plague vector control in Madagascar: Susceptibility status of Xenopsylla cheopis to 12 insecticides. ''PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases'', ''10''(2), e0004414.</ref> In the past, cases of plague in Madagascar have been bubonic and not transmittable person to person. The increase in plague cases over the last 20 years have been largely due to an increase in pneumonic plague.<ref name=\":1\" /> Pneumonic plague is transmitted person to person via infected droplets. It is often difficult to diagnose and by the time it is diagnosed, cases are usually fatal. Case fatality rate of pneumonic plague in Madagascar is close to 75%.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Confounding factors ===\n\n==== Rural to urban ====\nWhen an endemic disease, such as Ebola or plague, is introduced to a new geographic area that is densely populated with international shipping routes, it increases transmission rates and leads to severe outbreaks and potential pandemics. Although urban areas like Antananarvio and Mahajanga are more affluent, they are still impoverished in global comparison. Insufficient waste management, lack of clean water, and poor infrastructure are all issues that are breeding grounds for rats and fleas and therefore perpetuate plague transmission in urban areas.<ref name=\":5\"/> Furthermore, the rat-to-flea cycle of transmission has not changed since the first pandemic of plague. This type of consistency allows the organism to become more infectious.\n\n==== Rats and fleas ====\nHigh rates of plague transmission have been associated with low rat abundance and high volume of flea vectors.<ref name=\":2\" /> Historically, rats who acted as hosts to the flea vector subsequently died once they were infected with plague. However, the organism evolved and scientists are now finding that rats are not dying from plague. This means that plague survives longer in the host and allows for the bacteria to live longer and potentially infect more people. Scientists discovered three new strains of ''Y. pestis'' in Madagascar in 2017. Additionally, one strain of ''Y. pestis'' was found to be resistant to antibiotic treatment.<ref name=\":6\" /> Because of plague moving from rural to urban areas, there is increased risk for transmission to other countries. Urban areas that are a major transportation hub for shipping and recreation are at high risk for transmitting plague to nearby countries. The elevation of the mountains where most of the agriculture takes place, in addition to the ideal climate that allows rats and fleas to prosper, scientists have seen plague thrive in Madagascar's climate compared to other countries where there is endemic plague. During this plague season, rats and fleas infect the soil.\n\n==== Evolution of bacteria ====\nScientists discovered three new strains of ''Y. pestis'' in Madagascar in 2017. Additionally, one strain of ''Y. pestis'' was found to be resistant to antibiotic treatment.<ref name=\":6\" /> Because of plague moving from rural to urban areas, there is increased risk for transmission to other countries. Urban areas that are a major transportation hub for shipping and recreation are at high risk for transmitting plague to nearby countries.\n\n==== Agriculture ====\nPlague in Madagascar is predominantly a rural disease related to agricultural activities.  Plague \"season\" (October through April) coincides with the hot and rainy season in the agricultural highlands. Rats do not thrive in cold climate, and therefore are more prevalent during this time of year. Rice is a vital crop in Madagascar, and due to the high prevalence of fleas and rats in agricultural areas, plague bacteria often infects crops and soil. Many scientists have found that the plague bacteria ''Y. pestis'' can live in soil for months at a time.<ref name=\":3\">Chanteau, S., Ratsifasoamanana, L., Rasoamanana, B., Rahalison, L., Randriambelosoa, J., Roux, J....Rabeson, D. (1998). Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. ''Emerging Infectious Diseases'', ''4''(1), 101-104. <nowiki>https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid0401.980114</nowiki>.</ref>\n\n==== Burial practices ====\nIn addition to agricultural factors that increase prevalence of plague, burial practices in Madagascar also spread disease. Famadihana is a burial practice in Madagascar that is practiced among the Malagasy people. It is commonly known as \"turning of the bones.\" Family members exhume their deceased family members from the family crypts and wrap them up in fresh cloth. Then, they dance around the crypt with the body to live music. This custom is based on a belief that the dead do not join the rest of their ancestors until their body reaches full decomposition with appropriate ceremonies. This process could take up to several years and involves direct contact with corpses. This burial practice perpetuates the spread of plague among other diseases.<ref>Ramasindrazana, B., Andrianaivoarimanana, V., Rakotondramanga, J. M., Birdsell, D. N., Ratsitorahina, M., & Rajerison, M. (2017). Pneumonic Plague Transmission, Moramanga, Madagascar, 2015. ''Emerging Infectious Diseases'', ''23''(3), 521.</ref>\n\n==== Poverty ====\nPlague is symptomatic of poverty. Rats and fleas thrive in rural and urban areas of Madagascar due to the impoverishment of the country. Lack of proper infrastructure, lack of sanitation and waste removal, little clean water, and scarce health facilities create a perfect breeding ground for rats and fleas to thrive.<ref>Migliani, R., Chanteau, S., Rahalison, L., Ratsitorahina, M., Boutin, J. P., Ratsifasoamanana, L., & Roux, J. (2006). Epidemiological trends for human plague in Madagascar during the second half of the 20th century: a survey of 20 900 notified cases. ''Tropical Medicine & International Health'', ''11''(8), 1228-1237.</ref> Although plague is prevalent in other countries, Madagascar has the highest fatality and accounts for 30% of all plague cases largely due to poverty and lack of health resources like antibiotics and proper testing. Furthermore, outbreaks of plague have become increasingly more severe due to bubonic plague going untreated and developing into pneumonic plague. Once plague becomes pneumonic, it is significantly more contagious and is transmittable person to person.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Severity ===\nRecently, plague outbreaks have become increasingly more severe. The most recent outbreak in August 2017 is the worst to date with over 1,800 confirmed cases of plague. Of these confirmed cases, 1,100 of them were cases of pneumonic plague. 114 districts of Madagascar were affected by the plague outbreak. Usually, endemic plague only affects around 20 rural districts.<ref name=\":1\" /> This outbreak was different in nature due to the fact that the plague shifted from rural geographic location to urban geographic location. Plague was found in major shipping ports like Mahajanga and in the capital Antananarvio. The capital alone is home to 2.7 million people.<ref name=\":3\" /> Plague moving into urban areas increased transmission rates due to the high volume of people living in these areas and the amount of trade traffic that occurs on a daily basis.\n\n==Response to the disease==\nMadagascar proposed a National Plague Control Program, which is a surveillance program run by the government and the Ministry of Health that is based on immediate notification of every suspected case of plague. Every case reported to the National Plague Control Program is treated with antibiotics. In addition to this course of treatment, insecticide is brought to the home or work for flea control. Although the ideas and intentions of the National Plague Control Program are great and in theory could be very beneficial to treating and preventing outbreaks of plague. However, severe economic limitations make the execution of this program less than ideal. Furthermore, disparities in rural areas compared to urban areas make accessibility and testing in rural areas challenging.<ref name=\":5\" /> Economic resources need to be strengthened before this program can live up to its full potential. After the most recent, major outbreak, the WHO created a Crisis Emergency Committee to monitor the situation. They deployed epidemiologists, doctors, and risk management coordinators in order to coordinate surveillance, facilitate tracing contacts, oversee case management, administer isolation protocol, and distribute supplies. In addition to the new committee, Madagascar reallocated funds in order to help with isolation, treatment, and supplies.<ref name=\":1\" /> These solutions to the outbreak helped, as cases of plague declined and hospitalized patients decreased in volume. However, now that the major outbreaks have been handled, how do we continue to mitigate the burden of disease in these rural areas? Why is it that resources and funds are allocated only when outbreaks occur in dense, urban areas? How do we take steps to prevent against the next major outbreak?

(2013). Plague: history and contemporary analysis. ''Journal of Infection'', ''66''(1), 18-26.</ref> There are three types of plague: bubonic, pneumonic and septicemic. Bubonic plague is the most well-known type. This type of plague results in swollen lymph nodes that are called buboes. This type of plague is treatable with antibiotics, but if not treated effectively, the infection can spread to different parts of the body. Pneumonic plague occurs when plague infects the lungs and is transmissible person to person through infected droplets. This form of plague is very deadly. Septicemic plague occurs when plague enters the blood. Skin and tissues turn black and die, and bleeding into skin and organs often occurs. This form of plague is also deadly. Pneumonic plague and septicemic plague often occur when bubonic plague goes untreated and are difficult to diagnose.<ref name=\":0\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2018). Plague. 2018.</ref>\n\n=== Endemic plague ===\nPlague has endemically resided in Madagascar since it was first brought to the island from India in 1898, on the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|central high plateau of Madagascar]], usually occurring every year as a seasonal upsurge during the rainy season.<ref name=\":2\">Andrianaivoarimanana, V., Kreppel, K., Elissa, N., Duplantier, J. M., Carniel, E., Rajerison, M., & Jambou, R. (2013). Understanding the persistence of plague foci in Madagascar. ''PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases'', ''7''(11), e2382.</ref> Plague resides in Madagascar similar to the way flu resides in the United States. \"Plague season\" is generally October through March, and mostly affects rural areas of Madagascar.<ref name=\":0\" /> Plague, although endemic, has been relatively dormant in Madagascar until 1990. Annually until then, there were about 20-30 cases reported a year. Recently, however, the annual number of cases has risen to typically between 800 and 1500 a year.<ref name=\":1\">World Health Organization (2018). Plague \u2013 Madagascar. 2018.</ref> All cases of plague must be reported to the Ministry of Health; however, cases often go underreported due to lack of quality epidemiologic resources in rural areas. Tests for plague used in these areas often have low sensitivity and are unreliable.<ref name=\":5\">Miarinjara, A., & Boyer, S. (2016). Current perspectives on plague vector control in Madagascar: Susceptibility status of Xenopsylla cheopis to 12 insecticides. ''PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases'', ''10''(2), e0004414.</ref> In the past, cases of plague in Madagascar have been bubonic and not transmittable person to person. The increase in plague cases over the last 20 years have been largely due to an increase in pneumonic plague.<ref name=\":1\" /> Pneumonic plague is transmitted person to person via infected droplets. It is often difficult to diagnose and by the time it is diagnosed, cases are usually fatal. Case fatality rate of pneumonic plague in Madagascar is close to 75%.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Confounding factors ===\n\n==== Rural to urban ====\nWhen an endemic disease, such as Ebola or plague, is introduced to a new geographic area that is densely populated with international shipping routes, it increases transmission rates and leads to severe outbreaks and potential pandemics. Although urban areas like Antananarvio and Mahajanga are more affluent, they are still impoverished in global comparison. Insufficient waste management, lack of clean water, and poor infrastructure are all issues that are breeding grounds for rats and fleas and therefore perpetuate plague transmission in urban areas.<ref name=\":5\"/> Furthermore, the rat-to-flea cycle of transmission has not changed since the first pandemic of plague. This type of consistency allows the organism to become more infectious.\n\n==== Rats and fleas ====\nHigh rates of plague transmission have been associated with low rat abundance and high volume of flea vectors.<ref name=\":2\" /> Historically, rats who acted as hosts to the flea vector subsequently died once they were infected with plague. However, the organism evolved and scientists are now finding that rats are not dying from plague. This means that plague survives longer in the host and allows for the bacteria to live longer and potentially infect more people. Scientists discovered three new strains of ''Y. pestis'' in Madagascar in 2017. Additionally, one strain of ''Y. pestis'' was found to be resistant to antibiotic treatment.<ref name=\":6\" /> Because of plague moving from rural to urban areas, there is increased risk for transmission to other countries. Urban areas that are a major transportation hub for shipping and recreation are at high risk for transmitting plague to nearby countries. The elevation of the mountains where most of the agriculture takes place, in addition to the ideal climate that allows rats and fleas to prosper, scientists have seen plague thrive in Madagascar's climate compared to other countries where there is endemic plague. During this plague season, rats and fleas infect the soil.\n\n==== Evolution of bacteria ====\nScientists discovered three new strains of ''Y. pestis'' in Madagascar in 2017. Additionally, one strain of ''Y. pestis'' was found to be resistant to antibiotic treatment.<ref name=\":6\" /> Because of plague moving from rural to urban areas, there is increased risk for transmission to other countries. Urban areas that are a major transportation hub for shipping and recreation are at high risk for transmitting plague to nearby countries.\n\n==== Agriculture ====\nPlague in Madagascar is predominantly a rural disease related to agricultural activities.  Plague \"season\" (October through April) coincides with the hot and rainy season in the agricultural highlands. Rats do not thrive in cold climate, and therefore are more prevalent during this time of year. Rice is a vital crop in Madagascar, and due to the high prevalence of fleas and rats in agricultural areas, plague bacteria often infects crops and soil. Many scientists have found that the plague bacteria ''Y. pestis'' can live in soil for months at a time.<ref name=\":3\">Chanteau, S., Ratsifasoamanana, L., Rasoamanana, B., Rahalison, L., Randriambelosoa, J., Roux, J....Rabeson, D. (1998). Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. ''Emerging Infectious Diseases'', ''4''(1), 101-104. <nowiki>https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid0401.980114</nowiki>.</ref>\n\n==== Burial practices ====\nIn addition to agricultural factors that increase prevalence of plague, burial practices in Madagascar also spread disease. Famadihana is a burial practice in Madagascar that is practiced among the Malagasy people. It is commonly known as \"turning of the bones.\" Family members exhume their deceased family members from the family crypts and wrap them up in fresh cloth. Then, they dance around the crypt with the body to live music. This custom is based on a belief that the dead do not join the rest of their ancestors until their body reaches full decomposition with appropriate ceremonies. This process could take up to several years and involves direct contact with corpses. This burial practice perpetuates the spread of plague among other diseases.<ref>Ramasindrazana, B., Andrianaivoarimanana, V., Rakotondramanga, J. M., Birdsell, D. N., Ratsitorahina, M., & Rajerison, M. (2017). Pneumonic Plague Transmission, Moramanga, Madagascar, 2015. ''Emerging Infectious Diseases'', ''23''(3), 521.</ref>\n\n==== Poverty ====\nPlague is symptomatic of poverty. Rats and fleas thrive in rural and urban areas of Madagascar due to the impoverishment of the country. Lack of proper infrastructure, lack of sanitation and waste removal, little clean water, and scarce health facilities create a perfect breeding ground for rats and fleas to thrive.<ref>Migliani, R., Chanteau, S., Rahalison, L., Ratsitorahina, M., Boutin, J. P., Ratsifasoamanana, L., & Roux, J. (2006). Epidemiological trends for human plague in Madagascar during the second half of the 20th century: a survey of 20 900 notified cases. ''Tropical Medicine & International Health'', ''11''(8), 1228-1237.</ref> Although plague is prevalent in other countries, Madagascar has the highest fatality and accounts for 30% of all plague cases largely due to poverty and lack of health resources like antibiotics and proper testing. Furthermore, outbreaks of plague have become increasingly more severe due to bubonic plague going untreated and developing into pneumonic plague. Once plague becomes pneumonic, it is significantly more contagious and is transmittable person to person.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Severity ===\nRecently, plague outbreaks have become increasingly more severe. The most recent outbreak in August 2017 is the worst to date with over 1,800 confirmed cases of plague. Of these confirmed cases, 1,100 of them were cases of pneumonic plague. 114 districts of Madagascar were affected by the plague outbreak. Usually, endemic plague only affects around 20 rural districts.<ref name=\":1\" /> This outbreak was different in nature due to the fact that the plague shifted from rural geographic location to urban geographic location. Plague was found in major shipping ports like Mahajanga and in the capital Antananarvio. The capital alone is home to 2.7 million people.<ref name=\":3\" /> Plague moving into urban areas increased transmission rates due to the high volume of people living in these areas and the amount of trade traffic that occurs on a daily basis.\n\n==Response to the disease==\nMadagascar proposed a National Plague Control Program, which is a surveillance program run by the government and the Ministry of Health that is based on immediate notification of every suspected case of plague. Every case reported to the National Plague Control Program is treated with antibiotics. In addition to this course of treatment, insecticide is brought to the home or work for flea control. Although the ideas and intentions of the National Plague Control Program are great and in theory could be very beneficial to treating and preventing outbreaks of plague. However, severe economic limitations make the execution of this program less than ideal. Furthermore, disparities in rural areas compared to urban areas make accessibility and testing in rural areas challenging.<ref name=\":5\" /> Economic resources need to be strengthened before this program can live up to its full potential. After the most recent, major outbreak, the WHO created a Crisis Emergency Committee to monitor the situation. They deployed epidemiologists, doctors, and risk management coordinators in order to coordinate surveillance, facilitate tracing contacts, oversee case management, administer isolation protocol, and distribute supplies. In addition to the new committee, Madagascar reallocated funds in order to help with isolation, treatment, and supplies.<ref name=\":1\" /> These solutions to the outbreak helped, as cases of plague declined and hospitalized patients decreased in volume. However, now that the major outbreaks have been handled, how do we continue to mitigate the burden of disease in these rural areas? Why is it that resources and funds are allocated only when outbreaks occur in dense, urban areas? How do we take steps to prevent against the next major outbreak?

He was active as a composer, recording artist, and live performer from the early 1970s until his death and was known for an often humorous style of original music that has elements of [[protest music|protest]] and social commentary.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the U.S. Army, he returned to [[Chicago]] in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs first as a hobby, and then becoming a club performer. \n\nA member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], Prine credited film critic [[Roger Ebert]] and singer-songwriter [[Kris Kristofferson]] with discovering him, resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|eponymous debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed with [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1981, he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life.

He was active as a composer, recording artist, and live performer from the early 1970s until his death and was known for an often humorous style of original music that has elements of [[protest music|protest]] and social commentary.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the U.S. Army, he returned to [[Chicago]] in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs first as a hobby, and then becoming a club performer. \n\nA member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], Prine credited film critic [[Roger Ebert]] and singer-songwriter [[Kris Kristofferson]] with discovering him, resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|eponymous debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed with [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1981, he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life. In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]].
