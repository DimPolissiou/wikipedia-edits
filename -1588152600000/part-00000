Demographic studies had tended to assert that the [[Arab]] population of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-controlled Palestine, a 94% majority at the turn of the century, had dwindled toward parity due to massive [[Zionist]] immigration. Peters radically challenged this picture by arguing that a substantial part of the Palestinian people were descended from immigrants from other Arab countries from the early 19th century onward. It followed, for Peters and many of her readers, that the picture of a native Palestinian population overwhelmed by Jewish immigration was little more than propaganda, and that in actuality two almost simultaneous waves of immigration met in what had been a relatively unpopulated land.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n''From Time Immemorial'' was praised by figures as varied as [[Barbara Tuchman]], [[Theodore H.

He misrepresents Chicago here, where \"the original\" means merely the origin of the borrowed material, which is, in this instance, Peters.\n\nNow look at the second bit of the quote from Chicago, chastely separated from the preceding sentence by a demure three-point ellipsis. As my associate Kate Levin has discovered, this passage (\"To cite a source from a secondary source...\") occurs on page 727, which is no less than 590 pages later than the material before the ellipsis, in a section titled \"Citations Taken from Secondary Sources.\" Here's the full quote, with what Dershowitz left out set in bold: \"'Quoted in'. To cite a source from a secondary source (\"quoted in\") is generally to be discouraged, '''since authors are expected to have examined the works they cite. If an original source is unavailable, however, both the original and the secondary source must be listed.'''\"\n\nSo Chicago is clearly insisting that unless Dershowitz went to the originals, he was obliged to cite Peters.

You can't reach a broad public if you are agnostic on the question of Israel. The broad public wants to know, where do you stand? And if you claim not to have a stand, you lose them. The BDS movement, it always says, and I'm using their language, \"We are a rights-based organization. We are based in international law.\" I agree with that. That's where you have to go: rights-based international law. But the international law is clear. You read the last sentence of the 2004 International Court of Justice opinion on the wall that Israel has been building in the West Bank, and the last sentence says, \"We look forward to two states: a Palestinian state alongside Israel and at peace with its neighbors.\" That's the law.<br>And if you want to go past that law or ignore the Israel part, you'll never reach a broad public.

Peters's \"history and defense\" of Israel deals with the demographic history of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Demographic studies had tended to assert that the [[Arab]] population of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-controlled Palestine, a 94% majority at the turn of the century, had dwindled toward parity due to massive [[Zionist]] immigration. Peters radically challenged this picture by arguing that a substantial part of the Palestinian people were descended from immigrants from other Arab countries from the early 19th century onward. It followed, for Peters and many of her readers, that the picture of a native Palestinian population overwhelmed by Jewish immigration was little more than propaganda, and that in actuality two almost simultaneous waves of immigration met in what had been a relatively unpopulated land.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n''From Time Immemorial'' was praised by figures as varied as [[Barbara Tuchman]], [[Theodore H.

He misrepresents Chicago here, where \"the original\" means merely the origin of the borrowed material, which is, in this instance, Peters.\n\nNow look at the second bit of the quote from Chicago, chastely separated from the preceding sentence by a demure three-point ellipsis. As my associate Kate Levin has discovered, this passage (\"To cite a source from a secondary source...\") occurs on page 727, which is no less than 590 pages later than the material before the ellipsis, in a section titled \"Citations Taken from Secondary Sources.\" Here's the full quote, with what Dershowitz left out set in bold: \"'Quoted in'. To cite a source from a secondary source (\"quoted in\") is generally to be discouraged, '''since authors are expected to have examined the works they cite.

Who could not support Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions? Of course you should. And most of the human rights organizations, church organizations have moved in that direction. The problem is the goal . . . The official BDS movement, they claim to be agnostic, neutral\u2014whatever term you want to use\u2014on the question of Israel. You can't reach a broad public if you are agnostic on the question of Israel. The broad public wants to know, where do you stand? And if you claim not to have a stand, you lose them. The BDS movement, it always says, and I'm using their language, \"We are a rights-based organization. We are based in international law.\" I agree with that. That's where you have to go: rights-based international law. But the international law is clear. You read the last sentence of the 2004 International Court of Justice opinion on the wall that Israel has been building in the West Bank, and the last sentence says, \"We look forward to two states: a Palestinian state alongside Israel and at peace with its neighbors.\" That's the law.<br>And if you want to go past that law or ignore the Israel part, you'll never reach a broad public. And then it's a cult. Then it's pointless, in my opinion. We're wasting time. And it's only a wasting of time. It becomes\u2014and I know it's a strong word, and I hope I won't be faulted for it\u2014but it becomes historically criminal, because there was a time where whatever we said, it made no difference. Nobody was listening. You could shout whatever you want\u2014who cares? But now, actually, we can reach people. There is a possibility. I'm not saying a certainty. I'm not even saying a probability. But there is a possibility that we can reach a broad public. And so we have to be very careful about the words we use, and we have to be very careful about the political strategy we map out.

Bolko II assumed full government over his domains in 1323, and made the formal division of the Duchy with his brother Albert: he received [[Strzelce Opolskie]] and Bolko II retained the main city of Opole.\n\nThanks to his marriage to Elisabeth, daughter of Duke [[Bernard of \u015awidnica]], Bolko II had a temporary close connection with the Polish King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]] (paternal grandfather of his wife). However, this alliance was short-lived: on 5 April 1327 in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], he paid homage to [[King John of Bohemia]]; he was the last Silesian Duke who became a vassal of Bohemia.\n\nDuring his rule in Opole, Bolko II focused on the economical development of his domains. He introduced German laws (see [[Magdeburg Law]]) in the villages; also, he supported [[trade]] and took care of the state of roads, in order to maintain the safety of travelers.\n\nThe good economy of his Duchy was used by Bolko II to obtain more lands: in 1351 he bought the towns of [[Byczyna]] and [[Kluczbork]] from Duke [[Wenceslaus I of Legnica]] and the district of [[S\u0142awi\u0119cice]] from Duke [[Boles\u0142aw of Bytom]].\n\nBolko II was particularly attached to the [[Franciscan]] monastery of Opole. Inside the monastery, he built the Chapel of St. Anna, which became the Family vault of the Dukes of Opole. When Bolko II died on 21 June 1356, he was buried there.\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nBy 6 May 1326, Bolko II married [[Elisabeth of \u015awidnica|Elisabeth]] (ca. 1315 \u2013 8/9 February 1348), daughter of Duke [[Bernard of \u015awidnica]]. They had seven children:<ref>According to old chronicles, Bolko II remarried after the death of his wife Elisabeth. The name of his second wife was possibly Margareta, and together they had a daughter, called Agnes, later wife of Margrave [[Jobst of Moravia]], later [[King of Germany]]. However, modern historians have debated (and even denied in some cases) the existence of the alleged second wife and daughter of Bolko II. According to the latest researches, this Agnes could be the same as Elisabeth, daughter of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolczyk and first (if the existence of Agnes is believed) wife of Jobst. The confusion was in the fact that Elisabeth probably also used the name Agnes (''Elisabeth-Agnes''), a custom which wasn't unusual at that time (for example, Viola of Cieszyn or Richenza of Poland, later Queens of Bohemia, changed their names to Elisabeth after their marriages; see their Wikipedia articles).
