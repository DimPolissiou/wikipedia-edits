The [[Holy Doors]] in the [[iconostasis]] remain open throughout the entire week, and the [[Artos]] (a leavened loaf of bread that was blessed during the [[Paschal Vigil]]) remains in the church and is venerated by everyone as they enter the temple as a way of \"greeting the Resurrected Christ\".\n\n[[Bright Friday]] is the annual [[feast day]] of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mother of God]]), as the \"Life-giving Spring\", and there are optional hymns which may be chanted in honor of the feast in addition to the paschal hymns. If any other feasts on the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|fixed cycle]] occur during Bright Week, they are transferred to a convenient day after [[Thomas Sunday]]. \n\nJust before the beginning of the [[Ninth Hour]] on [[Bright Saturday]], the Holy Doors are closed, and the services begin to return to their more normal form, although the chanting of the [[Troparion]] of Pascha, \"Christ is risen from the dead...\", as well as certain other paschal hymns, continue to be chanted until [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Divine Mercy Sunday]]\n*[[Eastertide]]\n*[[Octave of Easter]]\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscatinline|Holy Week}}\n{{Easter}}\n\n[[Category:Eastertide|Week]]\n[[Category:Weeks]]\n[[Category:Christian processions]]\n\n[[ru:\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0438\u0446\u0430]]\n", "name_user": "Afterwriting", "label": "safe", "comment": "Punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Week"}
