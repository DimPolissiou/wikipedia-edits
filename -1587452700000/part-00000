It was built from 1803 to 1812. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 April 2018.<ref name=nswshr-2009>{{cite NSW SHR|5055301|Hadley Park|hr=02009|fn=EF16/6554|accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Pre-contact history===\nThe area surrounding Hadley Park has a long history of occupation by the Mulgowie ([[Mulgoa, New South Wales|Mulgoa]]) and Boorooberongal Aboriginal people. Excavation of rock shelters on the western side of the [[Nepean River]] has revealed evidence of Aboriginal activity extending back approximately 20,000 years. Artefacts identified in the immediate vicinity of Hadley Park suggests that Aboriginal people camped on the high ground next to Cranebrook Creek. While initial contact between European settlers and the local Aboriginal population was reported to be friendly, from about 1800 conflict between the groups along the Nepean, Hawkesbury and surrounding districts had escalated, leading to [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]] establishing a military detachment on the Nepean at [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] in 1816. By this time, the Aboriginal population in the local region had significantly diminished due to disease, dislocation and open conflict, however Aboriginal people are recorded to still have been fishing and camping in the area in the 1850s. Hadley Park is part of a broader area that continues to be identified as a significant landscape by [[Darug]] groups and the Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council today.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n===European colonisation===\nEuropean settlement along the [[Hawkesbury River]] at [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]] and [[Richmond, New South Wales|Richmond]] was established by the mid-1790s. In June 1789, an exploration party led by [[Arthur Phillip|Governor Phillip]] and Captain [[Watkin Tench]] reached the banks of the Nepean River near to the future sites of Penrith and Castlereagh, where they observed there to be good soil for planting crops and grazing, and exchanged food and gifts with the local Aboriginal people. The isolation of the Nepean region, however, precluded the establishment of permanent settlement around Castlereagh until the early nineteenth century and it was not until 1803 that any land claims in the area were officially recognised. [[Philip Gidley King|Governor King]] made out 31 [[land grant]]s, mostly to former soldiers, with some land also being granted to free settlers and emancipists. Most of the Castlereagh land grants had river frontage and, unlike the earlier grants in Richmond and Windsor in the north, were set out in an orderly fashion, with straight north and south boundaries and eastern boundaries aligned to (Old) Castlereagh Road, which had been established in 1803 to join the new farming district with Windsor. The grants were also larger than those in the north, ranging between {{convert|70|and|160|acre|ha|0|order=flip}}, with the size of the allotments reflecting social status and family size. For instance, married non-commissioned officers were entitled to grants of up to {{convert|150|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} plus {{convert|10|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} per child and a single private was entitled to up to {{convert|90|acre|ha|0|order=flip}}. The ex-soldiers were also entitled to seeds and equipment from the government stores, food and clothing for up to a year and the services of convicts if they could support and feed them. Land grants were given on the proviso that areas would be cleared, put under cultivation and not transferred for five years. The Castlereagh area (also known as 'Mulgrave Place' and the 'District of Evan') soon became one of the colony's major agricultural regions and by 1804, enough trees had been cleared from the banks of the Nepean River to cause Governor King to intervene and forbid any further clearances.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nThe land on which Hadley Park is located was granted to Martin Mentz (also spelt as 'Mintz' or 'Mince') in 1803. Mentz arrived in the colony in 1791 as a free settler and enlisted in the [[New South Wales Corps|NSW Corps]] as a private. He was discharged from the Corps in March 1803 and was one of the 24 ex-soldiers who were granted land in the Castlereagh area by Governor King. Mentz's grant, received on 30 June, was for a total of {{convert|80|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} with river frontage. Mentz proceeded to clear and cultivate his land in accordance with the terms of the grant. By 1805 he had cleared over {{convert|20|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} and planted wheat, maize and barley, and used another {{convert|29|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} for grazing. With his wife, child and two servants, Mentz seems to have had some early success on the property, purchasing a range of agricultural and household goods from the government stores at [[Parramatta]] and [[Toongabbie]]. In August 1806, he leased {{convert|30|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} to a Charles Hadley for [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]45 and continued to live on a portion of his property. Mentz was granted a licence to sell alcohol in [[Sydney]] in 1810, and moved into town with his family, selling his remaining Nepean land holdings. In September of that year he transferred {{convert|50|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} to Anne Landers for A\u00a3150. The Old Register entry for Landers dated 6 September 1810 mentions the transfer of \"50 acres of land at the Nepean and a dwelling house\", with the addition of \"all buildings and appurtences\" in the final transfer of property made in August 1811. This record points to the existence of a collection of buildings, including a dwelling house, on the property by at least 1810.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n====Charles Hadley====\nCharles Hadley first arrived in NSW as a convict aboard the Matilda, one of the ships of the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]], which reached Sydney in 1791. Hadley gained an absolute pardon and went back to England, but returned to NSW several years later, arriving in Sydney in March 1806. By August of this year he was living at Castlereagh, on the land leased from Martin Mentz. In 1812, Hadley married Sarah Phillips, with who he already had a son.{{efn|Charles Hadley Jr, born 1810.}} By 1825, Charles and Sarah had gone on to have seven more children. Hadley was also growing his farm during this period, and his house at Hadley Park soon became a local landmark in the district. He kept cattle on his property and supplied meat to the [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]] government stores from 1815. Hadley also acquired a publican's license to sell liquor in as early as April 1817, and his inn, known as the \"First and Last\", was the only one operating in Castlereagh at this time. The exact location of this inn within his land holdings is unknown.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nBy 1821, Hadley was listed as holding a total of {{convert|300|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} at Castlereagh in the District of Evan. His reputation in the district continued to grow and he took on several civic responsibilities, including serving as a juror in 1819 and benefactor to the Windsor Bible Association in 1822. On 20 August 1822, five armed men broken into Charles Hadley's house and attacked him and his family, but made away with only a watch. Nepean Park was also built in 1822 on the adjoining allotment directly south of Hadley Park.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nIn early 1827, his wife Sarah left him for a neighbour, John Griffiths. Charles Hadley died in September the following year. In his will, he left Hadley Park to his oldest son, Charles Hadley Jr, who maintained the estate until his death in 1891.\n\n====Other Hadley family ownership====\nHadley Park experienced several significant flood events during the mid-nineteenth century, the worst occurring in 1867 and reportedly washing away all of Hadley Jr's furniture and goods. An 1885 survey of landholders in the Castlereagh area noted that Charles Hadley Jr at Hadley Park had {{convert|80|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} with nine horses, five cattle and four pigs and more livestock on a nearby holding. A later return in 1900 states that the property was under cultivation with maize and barley, further indicating a shift away from cattle.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nWith the death of Charles Hadley Jr in November 1891 and his wife Hannah only six days later, both from influenza, the northern lot with Hadley Park house passed to William Alvan Hadley Childs - the husband of their oldest daughter, Louisa Matilda Hadley. In April 1892, the 80 acre Hadley Park estate was assessed as having a value of A\u00a3800, with the most part being under cultivation. The property contained a brick house of seven rooms, a barn, stable and outbuildings, though they were in a dilapidated condition.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nWilliam Charles Hadley Childs, the son of Louisa Matilda Hadley and William Alvan Childs, was listed as the owner of the property in 1898. In August 1905, he repurchased all the blocks of land that had been separated from Hadley Park in the will of Charles Hadley Jr, reuniting the farm estate to its original {{convert|80|acre|ha|0|order=flip}}. William ran the property as a dairy farm, building a dairy building on the property sometime during the 1930s. Dairying became a popular industry in the Castlereagh district by the mid-twentieth century, with a 1941 survey showing all the land between the (Old) Castlereagh Road and the Nepean River being used for dairying purposes.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nWilliam died in July 1950 and his son, William George Childs, inherited the southern portion of the property, while his two daughters Hannah and Esla inherited the northern portion, including the house. Records from this time note that the northern portion equalled {{convert|44.5|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} and included a brick cottage with attic, weatherboard kitchen, iron garage, two sheds, feeders, dairy and bails, four pit silos, water supply, clearing and fencing. The southern portion was {{convert|50|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} and contained pit silos, an orchard, water supply, clearing and fencing and an unfinished galvanised iron hay shed. Between 1940 and 1961 a few improvements were made to the property including the addition of a new hay shed to the south of the dairy buildings, and part of the southern portion was planted with orchards to the river front, however these were removed by 1978.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n===Use as a quary===\nEsla and Hannah Childs continued to own Hadley Park until 1972 when the western portions of the property closest to the river<ref name=nswshr-2009-2009-2>Lots 1 and 2 DP87060</ref> were sold to Quarries Pty Ltd, thus ending over 150 years of ownership by the Hadley-Childs family. Quarrying, gravel and sand extraction had started along the Nepean River at Castlereagh from as early as the 1880s. Mining activities significantly increased from the 1970s, and many properties around the river were bought by mine and gravel companies. In 1978, Quarries Pty Ltd transferred the Hadley Park property to a subsidiary, Blue Metal and Gravel Ltd, which later became Blue Metal Industries, which was later bought out by [[Boral]] Ltd. By 1979, the larger quarrying companies that were operating at Castlereagh had combined their interests and were operating as part of the [[Penrith Lakes|Penrith Lakes Development Corporation]] (PLDC). PLDC has owned Hadley Park since 1998.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nQuarrying of the Hadley Park lots commenced {{circa|2001}}, in the areas west of Cranebrook Creek and east of the house to (Old) Castlereagh Road. Jacqueline Flower, a descendant of the Hadley family, moved into Hadley Park in 1996 and lived on the property (in a separate living quarters, not in the house) until 2008. The main house was propped in 2008-2009 and a series of physical surveys were undertaken to assess the fabric and condition of the buildings. The buildings at Hadley Park have since remained unoccupied.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n===Public ownership===\nIn March 2019 [[Minister for Planning (New South Wales)|Minister for Planning]] & Housing, [[Anthony Roberts]] announced the state government had taken ownership of the property. \"The acquisition of Hadley Park means we can preserve and protect this State Heritage listed site and allow future generations to come and learn about an important part of Australian history\" he said. 'Getting this property into public ownership has taken considerable efforst, and it's important we make sure the restoration work is done, and the needs of the community accounted for, before it is opened to the general public'. The [[Department of Planning and Environment (New South Wales)|Department of Planning and Environment]] will consult with the community to develop a management plan for the long-term future management of the property' he said. \"The Department is investigating options with the [[Department of Industry (New South Wales)|NSW Department of Industry]] on a training program for young apprentices and students to participate in the restoration work needed...\". The Planning Ministerial Corporation (PMC) will manage the property initially, while a full report on the condition of the site is produced, before restoration works commenced, based on a conservation management plan.<ref name=nswshr-2009/><ref>''[[Western Weekender]]'', 1 February 2019</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n===Setting and Curtilage===\nHadley Park comprises a farm house, a collection of farm buildings and a garden located in a part remnant colonial rural landscape, part man-made lakes scheme on the Nepean River floodplain. Visually, the floodplain is framed by the Cranebrook Escarpment to the east and the imposing Lapstone Monocline of the [[Blue Mountains National Park]] to the west. The monocline provides a dramatic backdrop to the property. The house, farm buildings and garden are located in the centre of the original 1803 lot, the easternmost portion of which has been quarried and inundated as part of the new Lake Burralow of the Penrith Lakes Scheme. The land west of the house slopes gently down to Cranebrook Creek, which has historically been an important feature of the property and its neighbour Nepean Park, which is located on the adjoining property directly south of Hadley Park. Land between Cranebrook Creek and Nepean River was quarried but has since been reconstructed into flat, grassed parkland, meaning that the property's connection to the river has been reinstated. The areas to the north and east of the property have been transformed into man-made lakes as part of the Penrith Lakes Scheme. The property's access way from Old Castlereagh Road has been partially removed with the quarrying of this road, and consequently the historical relationship between the two has been obscured.\n\nThe recommended curtilage largely corresponds to the original land grant for the property, which included frontage to the Nepean River. The eastern areas of the lots between the house and the former alignment of (Old) Castlereagh Road are not included in the curtilage as they have been quarried and inundated as part of one of the lakes of the Penrith Lakes Scheme. (Old) Castlereagh Road has been removed in this area, meaning that the historical and visual relationship between the property and the road has been lost.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n===Views===\nConnections between the property and related colonial properties are still evident in the landscape, despite years of quarrying and its subsequent transformation into the Penrith Lakes Scheme. Being located on a cleared floodplain, Hadley Park commands, and is evident in, long views in all directions. Views of and from the house are significant, including the view of the house and property with the Lapstone Monocline beyond (both on its own and as a group with Nepean Park), to and from the house to the Cranebrook Escarpment and Christ Church in Castlereagh to the east, and the view between the house and the mass concrete house, Smith Road, to the north. Hadley Park house was designed to be seen from Old Castlereagh Road.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n===Aboriginal cultural landscape===\nThe land of Hadley Park is part of a broader Aboriginal cultural landscape that extends from the Blue Mountains to the Cranebrook Escarpment. The Penrith Lakes area was a traditional meeting place for Aboriginal people. Its river and rich soils provided abundant natural vegetation and wildlife which supported Aboriginal people for many generations. Evidence of this history has been revealed through the over 500,000 artefacts were collected during the 25 years of sand and gravel mining at Penrith Lakes. This area of the Nepean River was also one of the many first contact places where local Aboriginal people were able to stay on their traditional lands by camping and working for the colonial settlers. It was a place of confrontation between Aboriginal people and colonial settlers before peaceful relationships were established.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n===Landscape elements===\nThe landscape is a remnant agricultural landscape with paddocks and fence lines and remnant kitchen garden and cultural plantings around the house. The land was substantially cleared by 1806.\nSignificant landscape elements are:<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n* peppercorn trees (''[[Schinus molle]] var. areira''), to the west of the line of buildings from north to south. Some may date from the early nineteenth century, while some may be self-seeded descendants of early trees. Peppercorn trees are considered markers of early nineteenth century properties in western Sydney\n* Chinese windmill palms (''[[Trachycarpus fortunei]]'') to the east and west of Hadley Park house, the earliest dating to the interwar period\n* prominent conifers, jacaranda (''J. mimosifolia'') and white cedar (''Melia azederach var.australasica'')\n* old lemon tree (''[[Citrus limon]]'') near the slab cottage and Hadley Park house\n* fruit trees including: orange trees (''[[Citrus sinensis]]'') east of the former stables outbuilding, plum (''[[Prunus]] X domestica'') west of the guest bedroom, loquat (''Eroibotrya japonica'') west of the guest bedroom, pecan (''[[Carya illinoinensis]]'') northeast of the house on the boundary to the front paddock\n* ancient eucalypts, including a cabbage gum (''[[Eucalyptus amplifolia]]'') south of the line of buildings\n* brick and stone-edged garden beds near Hadley Park house\n* brick paths near Hadley Park house\n* native vegetation along Cranebrook Creek\n* timber fencing\n\n===Buildings===\nHadley Park house (built prior to 1810) was built on the elevated terrace along the eastern side of the Cranebrook Creek tributary. Hadley Park house was designed as a substantial residence, with its main elevation facing Old Castlereagh Road. The house is a freestanding symmetrical construction, rectangular in plan, part two-storey (front) and part single-storey (rear). The two-storey front section has a jerkin-head roof, a brick [[chimney]] at the northern end and a false brick chimney at the southern end (for symmetry). The house is timber post and beam construction with sandstock brick nogging between the timber uprights. The [[facade]]s have an external painted [[brickwork]] face to weatherproof the building. The roof is framed in split [[rafter]]s and clad in [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]], and retains [[batten]]s for the earlier cladding of timber shingles. A wrap-around [[veranda]]h extends along the north, east and south elevations, with a concave curved corrugated iron roof supported on timber posts with concrete bases. Verandah floors are concrete. The western end of the northern verandah finishes in a timber slab wall, clad in metal sheets on the western side. Windows to the front section are timber-framed, double-hung with a short 3-paned lower [[Sash window|sash]] and a larger 6-paned upper sash.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nThe front section of the house contains a central hall/stair with a room to either side and the first floor contains a stairwell/hall with a bedroom on each side. The ground floor hall floor is of compacted earth, with the remaining floor surfaces of this floor being concrete over sandstock brick paving. The internal walls are plastered and the ground floor front room has timber tongue and grooved internal doors. There are also some {{circa|1920}}s-30s timber doors. One simple fireplace with timber mantelpiece is located in the northern ground floor front room. The stair is modern. Most internal ceilings are Masonite. The first floor rooms do not have ceilings and the walls are unlined, with the brick nogging exposed. The single-storey rear section contains three rooms under a steeply pitched, corrugated iron [[skillion roof]] with a small verandah under a continuation of the skillion. The windows to the rear section have timber slab shutters. The ceilings in the rear section are very low.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nOther developments include:<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n* Slab cottage (1806) (also called the [[weatherboard]] cottage): Single-storey timber slab cottage of two rooms, rectangular in plan, and with a [[hipped roof]] clad in corrugated iron in short sheets. The timber slab walls are protected with corrugated iron and flat metal sheets. The cottage has two doorways facing east, with the northern of these protected with a corrugated iron [[awning]]. Three  timber-framed window openings (now covered over externally) face west and have timber slab shutters with side hinges. One door is timber, ledged and braced and clad in plywood, while the other s a timber four-panel door. The internal floor is a thin concrete layer over earlier brick paving, which is visible in places. There is no ceiling. The roof retains timber battens, evidence of the original roof cladding of timber shingles. There are remains of a brick external fireplace on the cottage's northern elevation.\n* Bathroom and toilet outbuildings ({{circa|1950}}s-60s and {{circa|1930}}s respectively): The toilet outhouse, a small weatherboard building with a corrugated iron skillion roof, is located west of Hadley Park house and next to the bathroom outbuilding. The bathroom outbuilding is a single-storey, concrete block building with a shallow-pitched, corrugated iron [[gable]] roof which extends partly over the skillion to the rear wing verandah of the house. It has one timber-framed high window facing north and another facing east, along with a timber ledged and braced door. The gable ends to the north and south are clad in corrugated iron.\n* Guest bedroom ({{circa|1930}}s): Single storey painted concrete block building, square in plan, with a corrugated iron clad hipped roof. Located to the west of Hadley Park house. The building has timber double-hung sash windows with a plywood door on the northern wall, and wide plywood [[eaves]]. There is a brick chimney on the building's southern side.\n* Water tank (19th century): Elevated corrugated iron water tank on a sawn plank platform supported on sawn timber beams and four circular bush posts.\n* Underground well and water pump (1806-1828): Underground circular brick well, covered over with timber slabs. Located west of the slab cottage. A timber-framed, skillion-roof [[shed]], clad in corrugated iron sheets, has been built over the water pump and well, probably when the pump was converted to electrical power sometime in the twentieth century.\n* Former wash house (1806-1828): Timber slab building of post and beam construction with a corrugated iron skillion roof, located west of the underground well and water pump. The building abuts a peppercorn tree.\n* Chicken shed: Simple timber-framed mesh chicken shed located to the west of the bathroom and toilet outbuildings.\n* Former stables outbuilding (1806-1828 with 1950s-60s extension): Rectangular building of post and beam construction with a gable roof clad in timber slab and corrugated iron. The building's long walls face north and south, with the northern wall mostly open. The building was extended to the east {{circa|1950}}s-60s. This extension is also of post and beam construction with a corrugated iron gable roof and corrugated iron clad walls.\n* Former cream shed ({{circa|1900}}-1950): Small weatherboard shed with corrugated iron gable roof and southern wall clad in corrugated iron. Northern end with corrugated iron skillion-roof supported on timber posts contains covered stalls.\n* Former dairy head stalls/store ({{circa|1900}}-1950): Three connected corrugated iron [[sheds]] of post and beam construction, all with corrugated iron gable roofs. The northern and centre connected sheds at are rectangular in plan with long axes running east to west. The centre shed is wider. The southernmost connected shed is L-shaped in plan. The northern shed in half open of the eastern side, the middle shed is completely open on the eastern side, and the southern shed is open on the northern side and part of the eastern and western sides. The three sheds have earth floors and contain timber stalls and timber feeding troughs. One shed has an old sulky. Also former site of 1870s barn.\n* Dairy and milk storage shed ({{circa|1900}}-1950): Two connected sheds with corrugated iron gable roofs. The western shed is rectangular in plan with long axes running north to south. It is of timber post and beam construction with a concrete floor and footings, and is open to the north. The eastern shed is taller and square in plan, with a concrete floor and square timber posts and open on all sides. The eastern shed appears to be of a later date.\n* Hay shed ({{circa|1947}}-1961): Substantial shed of bush pol and beam construction, rectangular in plan and with concrete footings. The shed is open to the east and north, with a corrugated iron roof and corrugated iron clad walls to the west and south.\n* Modern hay shed: Modern shed, rectangular in plan, located to the south of the former cream shed. Timber posts with flat metal roof and open on all sides.\n\n===Movable items===\nThere is a considerable collection of movable items relating to the occupation and use of the house and farm stored in the slab cottage and the guest bedroom. The collection was catalogued in 2010 and includes furniture, kitchen utensils, crockery and cutlery, children's toys and objects related to the use of the farm as a dairy. The front garden gate evident in historical photographs is also part of this collection.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 25 July 2017, the condition of the buildings ranges from fair to good. The house and slab cottage have both had recent conservation works, including propping and bracing and termite treatment. In Hadley Park house the concrete floors have been cut away from walls and sacrificial render applied {{circa|2010}} to arrest rising damp. The slab cottage has been clad in corrugated iron and clear perspex to protect it from the weather.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park house and outbuildings, the slab cottage and farm buildings all have a high level of integrity. The landscape between Cranebrook Creek and Nepean River has been reconstructed.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nHadley Park house: Verandah and some internal floors concreted mid-twentieth century. See history for other additions.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 29 August 2018, Hadley Park is of state significance for its historical, aesthetic and representative values, research potential and rarity. Hadley Park is a layered cultural landscape that documents the different historical phases of the Castlereagh area from pre-contact Aboriginal occupation on the Nepean River to early nineteenth century colonial expansion, settlement and development, and later twentieth century extractive industry. Hadley Park an early colonial rural property which dates to the one of the earliest phases of European settlement in Australia and documents over 200 years of continued occupation and agricultural land use. The main house and slab cottage provide rare surviving and highly intact evidence of some of the earliest colonial construction methods in Australia. Hadley Park is an excellent and largely unaltered example of an early colonial rural property, including a main house, earlier slab cottage, farm outbuildings and cultural plantings, prominently located on the Nepean River floodplain at Castlereagh.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park is a remnant of what was formerly a substantially intact rural colonial landscape of a large scale, and is one of a collection of properties that demonstrate the development of the community of Castlereagh from the colonial period to today.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 April 2018 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nHadley Park is of state heritage significance as a layered cultural landscape that documents the different historical phases of the Castlereagh area from pre-contact Aboriginal cultural landscape on the Nepean River to early nineteenth century colonial expansion, settlement and development, and later twentieth century extractive industry. Hadley Park is a remnant of what was formerly a substantially intact rural colonial landscape of a large scale, and is one of a collection of properties in Castlereagh that demonstrate the development of the area from the colonial period to today.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park is located on land that is part of a broader Aboriginal cultural landscape that bears evidence of thousands of years of occupation and use by Aboriginal people. The landscape and waterways of the Castlereagh terrace, including Cranebrook lagoon within Hadley Park and the Nepean River, supported many generations of the Mulgowie and Boorooberongal Aboriginal people, who were also present when the first European farms were established on the land.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park provides highly intact evidence of an early colonial rural property dating to one of the earliest phases of European settlement in Australia-the period of colonial expansion inland towards the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] in the search for land better suited to European farming techniques. The cleared landscape around the house, with small areas of remnant vegetation along the lagoon, and remnant cultivated and fenced paddocks, along with the farm house, slab cottage and domestic garden, demonstrate colonial attitudes and approaches to agriculture and farm planning, including extensive land clearing.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nDue to its almost 200-year period of continued occupation and use by a single family, the Hadley-Childs, Hadley Park retains evidence of changing agricultural practices in the Castlereagh area over this period, from crop growing and grazing in the nineteenth century to the proliferation of dairies in the first half of the twentieth century.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nHadley Park is of state heritage significance for the intact evidence it provides of colonial rural vernacular construction techniques and design, and colonial farm planning. Hadley Park house exemplifies the brick nogging construction style that was commonly used for farm houses in the early colonial period. The use of a jerkin-head roof and false chimney to maintain building symmetry illustrate rural vernacular tastes and styles of the time. The slab cottage, with its split timber framing and feather-edged weatherboard walling, exemplifies this early colonial rural construction technique. Both buildings are largely intact.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nThe collection of farm buildings set within a domestic garden with fruit trees and peppercorn trees, and with a kitchen garden, typifies nineteenth-century rural lifestyles and tastes. The siting of the buildings on a rise above the Cranebrook lagoon demonstrates the adaptation of European rural estate planning to local conditions.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nViewed against the dramatic backdrop of the [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]] Monocline, the collection of buildings and plantings, arranged in a north\u2013south line with the Cranebrook lagoon beyond, displays aesthetic qualities of special charm and character. Hadley Park, with its distinctive white-painted jerkin-head roofed farm house and row of tall Chinese windmill palms, is a landmark of the Castlereagh area, visible from all directions, and retains a significant visual connection to Christ Church on the Cranebrook escarpment.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nHadley Park is of state heritage significance as an assemblage of early colonial buildings, gardens, objects and archaeological resources that provide intact evidence of early construction techniques, estate planning, agriculture and rural life from the early colonial period to today. A process of gradual accretion over 200+ years, but without substantial alterations or additions and with careful conservation works in recent years, has resulted in Hadley Park being an important benchmark site in understanding early colonial rural development, vernacular construction, and rural lives.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park has a high potential for a range of archaeological remains associated with significant early phases of European occupation on the property. Potential archaeological features include the remains of former structures, services, silage pits and evidence of former landscaping, gardens, paths and roads. The potential archaeological remains at Hadley Park may yield valuable information relating to the layout and development of the property over time, which could be incorporated into comparative analyses with other early nineteenth century colonial farm complexes in NSW. The potential archaeological resource could also reveal insights into past human-environment interaction on the Nepean River and early methods of sanitation and water supply, as well as past agricultural activity and technologies. Artefacts may also survive in potential underfloor deposits in structures and in yard deposits/refuse pits or dumps. Such artefacts could reveal insights into the personal lives of Hadley Park's former inhabitants and early rural lifestyles in NSW more generally, including diets and consumption patterns.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nHadley Park house and the slab cottage provide rare and unusually intact evidence of some of the earliest colonial construction methods in Australia-brick nogging and slab walling respectively-as well as how these buildings were inhabited and used. The house and cottage are remarkably unaltered, with only minimal intervention in recent years to stabilise and preserve the buildings, meaning that their original construction along with later, minor adaptations such as wallpaper and floor coverings, are all evident. The integrity of these buildings and their ability to accurately demonstrate these early construction techniques, and the way of life of those who occupied such buildings, is rare in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nThe combination of buildings including interiors, outbuildings, kitchen garden, farm structures, remnant fences, cultural plantings, remnant native vegetation, archaeology and movable collection show unusually accurate evidence of European occupation of the outer reaches of the colony at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and the establishment and development of agriculture in the Penrith region over 200 years.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nHadley Park is of state heritage significance as a representative, highly intact example of a colonial rural property with associated buildings and landscape. It demonstrates the principal characteristics of this class of items, including an intact Georgian two-storey brick homestead, earlier slab cottage, farm outbuildings (including a dairy, dairy stalls and hay shed) and cultural plantings including peppercorn trees, fruit trees and remnant native vegetation.  Together these elements demonstrate attributes typical of rural lifestyles in Sydney from the early colonial period to the mid twentieth century.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park house is an outstanding representative example of the more modest colonial homesteads built by smaller landholders in NSW. It is little changed since its construction {{circa|1811}} and demonstrates the key characteristics of the type, including brick nogging construction, jerkin-head roof, false chimney to maintain symmetry, wrap-around verandah, and dirt or brick paved ground floor. The slab cottage is also an outstanding representative example of these types of buildings, with much of its early fabric intact.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park also forms part of a group which collectively illustrates a colonial cultural landscape in western Sydney. It is one of a series of properties that relate to the development of the Nepean River floodplain at Castlereagh for food production for the young colony, including neighbouring Nepean Park, and the properties of Landers Inn, McCarthys Cemetery, the Methodist Church Group and Cemetery, and the Upper Castlereagh school house and school master's residence.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|New South Wales}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notes}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|author=Environmental Resources Australia (ERM)|date=2001|title=Penrith Lakes Scheme Cultural Heritage Management Study}}\n* {{cite book|author=French, Brian A.|date=1996|title=Reappraisal of the Penrith Lakes Scheme and a Conservation Plan for Hadley Park, Castlereagh}}\n* {{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan|date=2014|title=Penrith Lakes Archaeological Management Plan (draft)}}\n* {{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan|date=2013|title=Hadley Park Conservation Management Plan}}\n* {{cite book|author=Graham Edds & Associates|date=1996|title=Hadley Park: Conservation/Management Plan (draft)}}\n* {{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Sean|date=2017|title=Trust Action: Hadley Park, Castlereagh - a survivor  in search of a future}}\n* {{cite book|last=Lavelle|first=Siobhan|date=1996|title=Archaeological & Heritage Assessment: RES Site 15 Minnaville, Penrith Lakes Scheme Area, Castlereagh}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Morris, C. |author2=Britton, G.|date=2000|title=Colonial Landscapes of the Cumberland Plain and Camden, NSW}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Morris, C. |author2=Britton, G.|date=1999|title=Castlereagh Cultural Landscape Study - assessment and recommendations}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Morris, C. |author2=Britton, G. |author3=NSW National Trust (for the Heritage Council of NSW)|date=2000|title=Colonial  Landscapes of the Cumberland Plain and Camden, NSW|number=4.8}}\n* {{cite book|author=Muru Cultural Heritage Services|date=2010|title=Recording of Movable Heritage Items at Hadley Park}}\n* {{cite book|author=NSW Dept of Environment & Planning|date=1986|title=Penrith Lakes Scheme Regional Environmental Study: history of European settlement}}\n* {{cite book|author=unknown|date=|title=Penrith Lakes Scheme|number=}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Hadley Park|dno=5055301|id=2009|year=2020|accessdate=18 February 2020}}\n\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Castlereagh, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Historic sites in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Aboriginal communities in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Quarries in Australia]]\n[[Category:Farms in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- Article title: Hadley Park SHRNo:2009 DatabaseNo:5055301 -->\n{{Use Australian English|date=February 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Infobox historic site \n| name = Hadley Park\n| image = Hadley-park-castlereagh-penrith-in-pictures-c008-1.jpg\n| caption = Hadley Park, {{circa|1810}}\n| image_size = 240px\n| locmapin = New South Wales\n| map_caption = \n| coordinates = {{coord|-33.6879|150.6639|region:AU-NSW_type:landmark|display=inline,title|format=dms}}\n| map_relief = yes\n| location = 14-278 Old Castlereagh Road, [[Castlereagh, New South Wales|Castlereagh]], [[City of Penrith]], [[New South Wales]], Australia\n| area = \n| elevation = \n| height = \n| beginning_label = Design period\n| beginning_date = \n| formed = \n| founded = \n| built = 1803&ndash;1812\n| built_for = \n| demolished = \n| architect = \n| architecture = \n| owner = [[Penrith Lakes|Penrith Lakes Development Corporation]]\n| designation1 = New South Wales State Heritage Register\n| designation1_offname = Hadley Park\n| designation1_type = State heritage (complex / group)\n| designation1_date = 20 April 2018\n| delisted1_date = \n| designation1_partof = \n| designation1_number = 2009\n| designation1_free1name =  Type\n| designation1_free1value = Historic Landscape\n| designation1_free2name =  Category\n| designation1_free2value = Landscape - Cultural\n| designation1_free3name = Builders\n| designation1_free3value = \n}}\n\n'''Hadley Park''' is a heritage-listed former Aboriginal land, farm, dairy and gravel quarry and now unused building at 14-278 Old Castlereagh Road, [[Castlereagh, New South Wales|Castlereagh]], [[City of Penrith]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was built from 1803 to 1812. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 April 2018.<ref name=nswshr-2009>{{cite NSW SHR|5055301|Hadley Park|hr=02009|fn=EF16/6554|accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Pre-contact history===\nThe area surrounding Hadley Park has a long history of occupation by the Mulgowie ([[Mulgoa, New South Wales|Mulgoa]]) and Boorooberongal Aboriginal people. Excavation of rock shelters on the western side of the [[Nepean River]] has revealed evidence of Aboriginal activity extending back approximately 20,000 years. Artefacts identified in the immediate vicinity of Hadley Park suggests that Aboriginal people camped on the high ground next to Cranebrook Creek. While initial contact between European settlers and the local Aboriginal population was reported to be friendly, from about 1800 conflict between the groups along the Nepean, Hawkesbury and surrounding districts had escalated, leading to [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]] establishing a military detachment on the Nepean at [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] in 1816. By this time, the Aboriginal population in the local region had significantly diminished due to disease, dislocation and open conflict, however Aboriginal people are recorded to still have been fishing and camping in the area in the 1850s. Hadley Park is part of a broader area that continues to be identified as a significant landscape by [[Darug]] groups and the Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council today.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n===European colonisation===\nEuropean settlement along the [[Hawkesbury River]] at [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]] and [[Richmond, New South Wales|Richmond]] was established by the mid-1790s. In June 1789, an exploration party led by [[Arthur Phillip|Governor Phillip]] and Captain [[Watkin Tench]] reached the banks of the Nepean River near to the future sites of Penrith and Castlereagh, where they observed there to be good soil for planting crops and grazing, and exchanged food and gifts with the local Aboriginal people. The isolation of the Nepean region, however, precluded the establishment of permanent settlement around Castlereagh until the early nineteenth century and it was not until 1803 that any land claims in the area were officially recognised. [[Philip Gidley King|Governor King]] made out 31 [[land grant]]s, mostly to former soldiers, with some land also being granted to free settlers and emancipists. Most of the Castlereagh land grants had river frontage and, unlike the earlier grants in Richmond and Windsor in the north, were set out in an orderly fashion, with straight north and south boundaries and eastern boundaries aligned to (Old) Castlereagh Road, which had been established in 1803 to join the new farming district with Windsor. The grants were also larger than those in the north, ranging between {{convert|70|and|160|acre|ha|0|order=flip}}, with the size of the allotments reflecting social status and family size. For instance, married non-commissioned officers were entitled to grants of up to {{convert|150|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} plus {{convert|10|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} per child and a single private was entitled to up to {{convert|90|acre|ha|0|order=flip}}. The ex-soldiers were also entitled to seeds and equipment from the government stores, food and clothing for up to a year and the services of convicts if they could support and feed them. Land grants were given on the proviso that areas would be cleared, put under cultivation and not transferred for five years. The Castlereagh area (also known as 'Mulgrave Place' and the 'District of Evan') soon became one of the colony's major agricultural regions and by 1804, enough trees had been cleared from the banks of the Nepean River to cause Governor King to intervene and forbid any further clearances.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nThe land on which Hadley Park is located was granted to Martin Mentz (also spelt as 'Mintz' or 'Mince') in 1803. Mentz arrived in the colony in 1791 as a free settler and enlisted in the [[New South Wales Corps|NSW Corps]] as a private. He was discharged from the Corps in March 1803 and was one of the 24 ex-soldiers who were granted land in the Castlereagh area by Governor King. Mentz's grant, received on 30 June, was for a total of {{convert|80|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} with river frontage. Mentz proceeded to clear and cultivate his land in accordance with the terms of the grant. By 1805 he had cleared over {{convert|20|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} and planted wheat, maize and barley, and used another {{convert|29|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} for grazing. With his wife, child and two servants, Mentz seems to have had some early success on the property, purchasing a range of agricultural and household goods from the government stores at [[Parramatta]] and [[Toongabbie]]. In August 1806, he leased {{convert|30|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} to a Charles Hadley for [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]45 and continued to live on a portion of his property. Mentz was granted a licence to sell alcohol in [[Sydney]] in 1810, and moved into town with his family, selling his remaining Nepean land holdings. In September of that year he transferred {{convert|50|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} to Anne Landers for A\u00a3150. The Old Register entry for Landers dated 6 September 1810 mentions the transfer of \"50 acres of land at the Nepean and a dwelling house\", with the addition of \"all buildings and appurtences\" in the final transfer of property made in August 1811. This record points to the existence of a collection of buildings, including a dwelling house, on the property by at least 1810.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n====Charles Hadley====\nCharles Hadley first arrived in NSW as a convict aboard the Matilda, one of the ships of the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]], which reached Sydney in 1791. Hadley gained an absolute pardon and went back to England, but returned to NSW several years later, arriving in Sydney in March 1806. By August of this year he was living at Castlereagh, on the land leased from Martin Mentz. In 1812, Hadley married Sarah Phillips, with who he already had a son.{{efn|Charles Hadley Jr, born 1810.}} By 1825, Charles and Sarah had gone on to have seven more children. Hadley was also growing his farm during this period, and his house at Hadley Park soon became a local landmark in the district. He kept cattle on his property and supplied meat to the [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]] government stores from 1815. Hadley also acquired a publican's license to sell liquor in as early as April 1817, and his inn, known as the \"First and Last\", was the only one operating in Castlereagh at this time. The exact location of this inn within his land holdings is unknown.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nBy 1821, Hadley was listed as holding a total of {{convert|300|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} at Castlereagh in the District of Evan. His reputation in the district continued to grow and he took on several civic responsibilities, including serving as a juror in 1819 and benefactor to the Windsor Bible Association in 1822. On 20 August 1822, five armed men broken into Charles Hadley's house and attacked him and his family, but made away with only a watch. Nepean Park was also built in 1822 on the adjoining allotment directly south of Hadley Park.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nIn early 1827, his wife Sarah left him for a neighbour, John Griffiths. Charles Hadley died in September the following year. In his will, he left Hadley Park to his oldest son, Charles Hadley Jr, who maintained the estate until his death in 1891.\n\n====Other Hadley family ownership====\nHadley Park experienced several significant flood events during the mid-nineteenth century, the worst occurring in 1867 and reportedly washing away all of Hadley Jr's furniture and goods. An 1885 survey of landholders in the Castlereagh area noted that Charles Hadley Jr at Hadley Park had {{convert|80|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} with nine horses, five cattle and four pigs and more livestock on a nearby holding. A later return in 1900 states that the property was under cultivation with maize and barley, further indicating a shift away from cattle.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nWith the death of Charles Hadley Jr in November 1891 and his wife Hannah only six days later, both from influenza, the northern lot with Hadley Park house passed to William Alvan Hadley Childs - the husband of their oldest daughter, Louisa Matilda Hadley. In April 1892, the 80 acre Hadley Park estate was assessed as having a value of A\u00a3800, with the most part being under cultivation. The property contained a brick house of seven rooms, a barn, stable and outbuildings, though they were in a dilapidated condition.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nWilliam Charles Hadley Childs, the son of Louisa Matilda Hadley and William Alvan Childs, was listed as the owner of the property in 1898. In August 1905, he repurchased all the blocks of land that had been separated from Hadley Park in the will of Charles Hadley Jr, reuniting the farm estate to its original {{convert|80|acre|ha|0|order=flip}}. William ran the property as a dairy farm, building a dairy building on the property sometime during the 1930s. Dairying became a popular industry in the Castlereagh district by the mid-twentieth century, with a 1941 survey showing all the land between the (Old) Castlereagh Road and the Nepean River being used for dairying purposes.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nWilliam died in July 1950 and his son, William George Childs, inherited the southern portion of the property, while his two daughters Hannah and Esla inherited the northern portion, including the house. Records from this time note that the northern portion equalled {{convert|44.5|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} and included a brick cottage with attic, weatherboard kitchen, iron garage, two sheds, feeders, dairy and bails, four pit silos, water supply, clearing and fencing. The southern portion was {{convert|50|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} and contained pit silos, an orchard, water supply, clearing and fencing and an unfinished galvanised iron hay shed. Between 1940 and 1961 a few improvements were made to the property including the addition of a new hay shed to the south of the dairy buildings, and part of the southern portion was planted with orchards to the river front, however these were removed by 1978.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n===Use as a quary===\nEsla and Hannah Childs continued to own Hadley Park until 1972 when the western portions of the property closest to the river<ref name=nswshr-2009-2009-2>Lots 1 and 2 DP87060</ref> were sold to Quarries Pty Ltd, thus ending over 150 years of ownership by the Hadley-Childs family. Quarrying, gravel and sand extraction had started along the Nepean River at Castlereagh from as early as the 1880s. Mining activities significantly increased from the 1970s, and many properties around the river were bought by mine and gravel companies. In 1978, Quarries Pty Ltd transferred the Hadley Park property to a subsidiary, Blue Metal and Gravel Ltd, which later became Blue Metal Industries, which was later bought out by [[Boral]] Ltd. By 1979, the larger quarrying companies that were operating at Castlereagh had combined their interests and were operating as part of the [[Penrith Lakes|Penrith Lakes Development Corporation]] (PLDC). PLDC has owned Hadley Park since 1998.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nQuarrying of the Hadley Park lots commenced {{circa|2001}}, in the areas west of Cranebrook Creek and east of the house to (Old) Castlereagh Road. Jacqueline Flower, a descendent of the Hadley family, moved into Hadley Park in 1996 and lived on the property (in a separate living quarters, not in the house) until 2008. The main house was propped in 2008-2009 and a series of physical surveys were undertaken to assess the fabric and condition of the buildings. The buildings at Hadley Park have since remained unoccupied.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n===Public ownership===\nIn March 2019 [[Minister for Planning (New South Wales)|Minister for Planning]] & Housing, [[Anthony Roberts]] announced the state government had taken ownership of the property. \"The acquisition of Hadley Park means we can preserve and protect this State Heritage listed site and allow future generations to come and learn about an important part of Australian history\" he said. 'Getting this property into public ownership has taken considerable efforst, and it's important we make sure the restoration work is done, and the needs of the community accounted for, before it is opened to the general public'. The [[Department of Planning and Environment (New South Wales)|Department of Planning and Environment]] will consult with the community to develop a management plan for the long-term future management of the property' he said. \"The Department is investigating options with the [[Department of Industry (New South Wales)|NSW Department of Industry]] on a training program for young apprentices and students to participate in the restoration work needed...\". The Planning Ministerial Corporation (PMC) will manage the property initially, while a full report on the condition of the site is produced, before restoration works commenced, based on a conservation management plan.<ref name=nswshr-2009/><ref>''[[Western Weekender]]'', 1 February 2019</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n===Setting and Curtilage===\nHadley Park comprises a farm house, a collection of farm buildings and a garden located in a part remnant colonial rural landscape, part man-made lakes scheme on the Nepean River floodplain. Visually, the floodplain is framed by the Cranebrook Escarpment to the east and the imposing Lapstone Monocline of the [[Blue Mountains National Park]] to the west. The monocline provides a dramatic backdrop to the property. The house, farm buildings and garden are located in the centre of the original 1803 lot, the easternmost portion of which has been quarried and inundated as part of the new Lake Burralow of the Penrith Lakes Scheme. The land west of the house slopes gently down to Cranebrook Creek, which has historically been an important feature of the property and its neighbour Nepean Park, which is located on the adjoining property directly south of Hadley Park. Land between Cranebrook Creek and Nepean River was quarried but has since been reconstructed into flat, grassed parkland, meaning that the property's connection to the river has been reinstated. The areas to the north and east of the property have been transformed into man-made lakes as part of the Penrith Lakes Scheme. The property's access way from Old Castlereagh Road has been partially removed with the quarrying of this road, and consequently the historical relationship between the two has been obscured.\n\nThe recommended curtilage largely corresponds to the original land grant for the property, which included frontage to the Nepean River. The eastern areas of the lots between the house and the former alignment of (Old) Castlereagh Road are not included in the curtilage as they have been quarried and inundated as part of one of the lakes of the Penrith Lakes Scheme. (Old) Castlereagh Road has been removed in this area, meaning that the historical and visual relationship between the property and the road has been lost.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n===Views===\nConnections between the property and related colonial properties are still evident in the landscape, despite years of quarrying and its subsequent transformation into the Penrith Lakes Scheme. Being located on a cleared floodplain, Hadley Park commands, and is evident in, long views in all directions. Views of and from the house are significant, including the view of the house and property with the Lapstone Monocline beyond (both on its own and as a group with Nepean Park), to and from the house to the Cranebrook Escarpment and Christ Church in Castlereagh to the east, and the view between the house and the mass concrete house, Smith Road, to the north. Hadley Park house was designed to be seen from Old Castlereagh Road.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n===Aboriginal cultural landscape===\nThe land of Hadley Park is part of a broader Aboriginal cultural landscape that extends from the Blue Mountains to the Cranebrook Escarpment. The Penrith Lakes area was a traditional meeting place for Aboriginal people. Its river and rich soils provided abundant natural vegetation and wildlife which supported Aboriginal people for many generations. Evidence of this history has been revealed through the over 500,000 artefacts were collected during the 25 years of sand and gravel mining at Penrith Lakes. This area of the Nepean River was also one of the many first contact places where local Aboriginal people were able to stay on their traditional lands by camping and working for the colonial settlers. It was a place of confrontation between Aboriginal people and colonial settlers before peaceful relationships were established.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n===Landscape elements===\nThe landscape is a remnant agricultural landscape with paddocks and fence lines and remnant kitchen garden and cultural plantings around the house. The land was substantially cleared by 1806.\nSignificant landscape elements are:<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n* peppercorn trees (''[[Schinus molle]] var. areira''), to the west of the line of buildings from north to south. Some may date from the early nineteenth century, while some may be self-seeded descendants of early trees. Peppercorn trees are considered markers of early nineteenth century properties in western Sydney\n* Chinese windmill palms (''[[Trachycarpus fortunei]]'') to the east and west of Hadley Park house, the earliest dating to the interwar period\n* prominent conifers, jacaranda (''J. mimosifolia'') and white cedar (''Melia azederach var.australasica'')\n* old lemon tree (''[[Citrus limon]]'') near the slab cottage and Hadley Park house\n* fruit trees including: orange trees (''[[Citrus sinensis]]'') east of the former stables outbuilding, plum (''[[Prunus]] X domestica'') west of the guest bedroom, loquat (''Eroibotrya japonica'') west of the guest bedroom, pecan (''[[Carya illinoinensis]]'') northeast of the house on the boundary to the front paddock\n* ancient eucalypts, including a cabbage gum (''[[Eucalyptus amplifolia]]'') south of the line of buildings\n* brick and stone-edged garden beds near Hadley Park house\n* brick paths near Hadley Park house\n* native vegetation along Cranebrook Creek\n* timber fencing\n\n===Buildings===\nHadley Park house (built prior to 1810) was built on the elevated terrace along the eastern side of the Cranebrook Creek tributary. Hadley Park house was designed as a substantial residence, with its main elevation facing Old Castlereagh Road. The house is a freestanding symmetrical construction, rectangular in plan, part two-storey (front) and part single-storey (rear). The two-storey front section has a jerkin-head roof, a brick [[chimney]] at the northern end and a false brick chimney at the southern end (for symmetry). The house is timber post and beam construction with sandstock brick nogging between the timber uprights. The [[facade]]s have an external painted [[brickwork]] face to weatherproof the building. The roof is framed in split [[rafter]]s and clad in [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]], and retains [[batten]]s for the earlier cladding of timber shingles. A wrap-around [[veranda]]h extends along the north, east and south elevations, with a concave curved corrugated iron roof supported on timber posts with concrete bases. Verandah floors are concrete. The western end of the northern verandah finishes in a timber slab wall, clad in metal sheets on the western side. Windows to the front section are timber-framed, double-hung with a short 3-paned lower [[Sash window|sash]] and a larger 6-paned upper sash.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nThe front section of the house contains a central hall/stair with a room to either side and the first floor contains a stairwell/hall with a bedroom on each side. The ground floor hall floor is of compacted earth, with the remaining floor surfaces of this floor being concrete over sandstock brick paving. The internal walls are plastered and the ground floor front room has timber tongue and grooved internal doors. There are also some {{circa|1920}}s-30s timber doors. One simple fireplace with timber mantelpiece is located in the northern ground floor front room. The stair is modern. Most internal ceilings are Masonite. The first floor rooms do not have ceilings and the walls are unlined, with the brick nogging exposed. The single-storey rear section contains three rooms under a steeply pitched, corrugated iron [[skillion roof]] with a small verandah under a continuation of the skillion. The windows to the rear section have timber slab shutters. The ceilings in the rear section are very low.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nOther developments include:<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n* Slab cottage (1806) (also called the [[weatherboard]] cottage): Single-storey timber slab cottage of two rooms, rectangular in plan, and with a [[hipped roof]] clad in corrugated iron in short sheets. The timber slab walls are protected with corrugated iron and flat metal sheets. The cottage has two doorways facing east, with the northern of these protected with a corrugated iron [[awning]]. Three  timber-framed window openings (now covered over externally) face west and have timber slab shutters with side hinges. One door is timber, ledged and braced and clad in plywood, while the other s a timber four-panel door. The internal floor is a thin concrete layer over earlier brick paving, which is visible in places. There is no ceiling. The roof retains timber battens, evidence of the original roof cladding of timber shingles. There are remains of a brick external fireplace on the cottage's northern elevation.\n* Bathroom and toilet outbuildings ({{circa|1950}}s-60s and {{circa|1930}}s respectively): The toilet outhouse, a small weatherboard building with a corrugated iron skillion roof, is located west of Hadley Park house and next to the bathroom outbuilding. The bathroom outbuilding is a single-storey, concrete block building with a shallow-pitched, corrugated iron [[gable]] roof which extends partly over the skillion to the rear wing verandah of the house. It has one timber-framed high window facing north and another facing east, along with a timber ledged and braced door. The gable ends to the north and south are clad in corrugated iron.\n* Guest bedroom ({{circa|1930}}s): Single storey painted concrete block building, square in plan, with a corrugated iron clad hipped roof. Located to the west of Hadley Park house. The building has timber double-hung sash windows with a plywood door on the northern wall, and wide plywood [[eaves]]. There is a brick chimney on the building's southern side.\n* Water tank (19th century): Elevated corrugated iron water tank on a sawn plank platform supported on sawn timber beams and four circular bush posts.\n* Underground well and water pump (1806-1828): Underground circular brick well, covered over with timber slabs. Located west of the slab cottage. A timber-framed, skillion-roof [[shed]], clad in corrugated iron sheets, has been built over the water pump and well, probably when the pump was converted to electrical power sometime in the twentieth century.\n* Former wash house (1806-1828): Timber slab building of post and beam construction with a corrugated iron skillion roof, located west of the underground well and water pump. The building abuts a peppercorn tree.\n* Chicken shed: Simple timber-framed mesh chicken shed located to the west of the bathroom and toilet outbuildings.\n* Former stables outbuilding (1806-1828 with 1950s-60s extension): Rectangular building of post and beam construction with a gable roof clad in timber slab and corrugated iron. The building's long walls face north and south, with the northern wall mostly open. The building was extended to the east {{circa|1950}}s-60s. This extension is also of post and beam construction with a corrugated iron gable roof and corrugated iron clad walls.\n* Former cream shed ({{circa|1900}}-1950): Small weatherboard shed with corrugated iron gable roof and southern wall clad in corrugated iron. Northern end with corrugated iron skillion-roof supported on timber posts contains covered stalls.\n* Former dairy head stalls/store ({{circa|1900}}-1950): Three connected corrugated iron [[sheds]] of post and beam construction, all with corrugated iron gable roofs. The northern and centre connected sheds at are rectangular in plan with long axes running east to west. The centre shed is wider. The southernmost connected shed is L-shaped in plan. The northern shed in half open of the eastern side, the middle shed is completely open on the eastern side, and the southern shed is open on the northern side and part of the eastern and western sides. The three sheds have earth floors and contain timber stalls and timber feeding troughs. One shed has an old sulky. Also former site of 1870s barn.\n* Dairy and milk storage shed ({{circa|1900}}-1950): Two connected sheds with corrugated iron gable roofs. The western shed is rectangular in plan with long axes running north to south. It is of timber post and beam construction with a concrete floor and footings, and is open to the north. The eastern shed is taller and square in plan, with a concrete floor and square timber posts and open on all sides. The eastern shed appears to be of a later date.\n* Hay shed ({{circa|1947}}-1961): Substantial shed of bush pol and beam construction, rectangular in plan and with concrete footings. The shed is open to the east and north, with a corrugated iron roof and corrugated iron clad walls to the west and south.\n* Modern hay shed: Modern shed, rectangular in plan, located to the south of the former cream shed. Timber posts with flat metal roof and open on all sides.\n\n===Movable items===\nThere is a considerable collection of movable items relating to the occupation and use of the house and farm stored in the slab cottage and the guest bedroom. The collection was catalogued in 2010 and includes furniture, kitchen utensils, crockery and cutlery, children's toys and objects related to the use of the farm as a dairy. The front garden gate evident in historical photographs is also part of this collection.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 25 July 2017, the condition of the buildings ranges from fair to good. The house and slab cottage have both had recent conservation works, including propping and bracing and termite treatment. In Hadley Park house the concrete floors have been cut away from walls and sacrificial render applied {{circa|2010}} to arrest rising damp. The slab cottage has been clad in corrugated iron and clear perspex to protect it from the weather.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park house and outbuildings, the slab cottage and farm buildings all have a high level of integrity. The landscape between Cranebrook Creek and Nepean River has been reconstructed.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nHadley Park house: Verandah and some internal floors concreted mid-twentieth century. See history for other additions.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 29 August 2018, Hadley Park is of state significance for its historical, aesthetic and representative values, research potential and rarity. Hadley Park is a layered cultural landscape that documents the different historical phases of the Castlereagh area from pre-contact Aboriginal occupation on the Nepean River to early nineteenth century colonial expansion, settlement and development, and later twentieth century extractive industry. Hadley Park an early colonial rural property which dates to the one of the earliest phases of European settlement in Australia and documents over 200 years of continued occupation and agricultural land use. The main house and slab cottage provide rare surviving and highly intact evidence of some of the earliest colonial construction methods in Australia. Hadley Park is an excellent and largely unaltered example of an early colonial rural property, including a main house, earlier slab cottage, farm outbuildings and cultural plantings, prominently located on the Nepean River floodplain at Castlereagh.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park is a remnant of what was formerly a substantially intact rural colonial landscape of a large scale, and is one of a collection of properties that demonstrate the development of the community of Castlereagh from the colonial period to today.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 April 2018 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nHadley Park is of state heritage significance as a layered cultural landscape that documents the different historical phases of the Castlereagh area from pre-contact Aboriginal cultural landscape on the Nepean River to early nineteenth century colonial expansion, settlement and development, and later twentieth century extractive industry. Hadley Park is a remnant of what was formerly a substantially intact rural colonial landscape of a large scale, and is one of a collection of properties in Castlereagh that demonstrate the development of the area from the colonial period to today.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park is located on land that is part of a broader Aboriginal cultural landscape that bears evidence of thousands of years of occupation and use by Aboriginal people. The landscape and waterways of the Castlereagh terrace, including Cranebrook lagoon within Hadley Park and the Nepean River, supported many generations of the Mulgowie and Boorooberongal Aboriginal people, who were also present when the first European farms were established on the land.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park provides highly intact evidence of an early colonial rural property dating to one of the earliest phases of European settlement in Australia-the period of colonial expansion inland towards the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] in the search for land better suited to European farming techniques. The cleared landscape around the house, with small areas of remnant vegetation along the lagoon, and remnant cultivated and fenced paddocks, along with the farm house, slab cottage and domestic garden, demonstrate colonial attitudes and approaches to agriculture and farm planning, including extensive land clearing.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nDue to its almost 200-year period of continued occupation and use by a single family, the Hadley-Childs, Hadley Park retains evidence of changing agricultural practices in the Castlereagh area over this period, from crop growing and grazing in the nineteenth century to the proliferation of dairies in the first half of the twentieth century.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nHadley Park is of state heritage significance for the intact evidence it provides of colonial rural vernacular construction techniques and design, and colonial farm planning. Hadley Park house exemplifies the brick nogging construction style that was commonly used for farm houses in the early colonial period. The use of a jerkin-head roof and false chimney to maintain building symmetry illustrate rural vernacular tastes and styles of the time. The slab cottage, with its split timber framing and feather-edged weatherboard walling, exemplifies this early colonial rural construction technique. Both buildings are largely intact.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nThe collection of farm buildings set within a domestic garden with fruit trees and peppercorn trees, and with a kitchen garden, typifies nineteenth-century rural lifestyles and tastes. The siting of the buildings on a rise above the Cranebrook lagoon demonstrates the adaptation of European rural estate planning to local conditions.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nViewed against the dramatic backdrop of the [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]] Monocline, the collection of buildings and plantings, arranged in a north\u2013south line with the Cranebrook lagoon beyond, displays aesthetic qualities of special charm and character. Hadley Park, with its distinctive white-painted jerkin-head roofed farm house and row of tall Chinese windmill palms, is a landmark of the Castlereagh area, visible from all directions, and retains a significant visual connection to Christ Church on the Cranebrook escarpment.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nHadley Park is of state heritage significance as an assemblage of early colonial buildings, gardens, objects and archaeological resources that provide intact evidence of early construction techniques, estate planning, agriculture and rural life from the early colonial period to today. A process of gradual accretion over 200+ years, but without substantial alterations or additions and with careful conservation works in recent years, has resulted in Hadley Park being an important benchmark site in understanding early colonial rural development, vernacular construction, and rural lives.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park has a high potential for a range of archaeological remains associated with significant early phases of European occupation on the property. Potential archaeological features include the remains of former structures, services, silage pits and evidence of former landscaping, gardens, paths and roads. The potential archaeological remains at Hadley Park may yield valuable information relating to the layout and development of the property over time, which could be incorporated into comparative analyses with other early nineteenth century colonial farm complexes in NSW. The potential archaeological resource could also reveal insights into past human-environment interaction on the Nepean River and early methods of sanitation and water supply, as well as past agricultural activity and technologies. Artefacts may also survive in potential underfloor deposits in structures and in yard deposits/refuse pits or dumps. Such artefacts could reveal insights into the personal lives of Hadley Park's former inhabitants and early rural lifestyles in NSW more generally, including diets and consumption patterns.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nHadley Park house and the slab cottage provide rare and unusually intact evidence of some of the earliest colonial construction methods in Australia-brick nogging and slab walling respectively-as well as how these buildings were inhabited and used. The house and cottage are remarkably unaltered, with only minimal intervention in recent years to stabilise and preserve the buildings, meaning that their original construction along with later, minor adaptations such as wallpaper and floor coverings, are all evident. The integrity of these buildings and their ability to accurately demonstrate these early construction techniques, and the way of life of those who occupied such buildings, is rare in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nThe combination of buildings including interiors, outbuildings, kitchen garden, farm structures, remnant fences, cultural plantings, remnant native vegetation, archaeology and movable collection show unusually accurate evidence of European occupation of the outer reaches of the colony at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and the establishment and development of agriculture in the Penrith region over 200 years.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nHadley Park is of state heritage significance as a representative, highly intact example of a colonial rural property with associated buildings and landscape. It demonstrates the principal characteristics of this class of items, including an intact Georgian two-storey brick homestead, earlier slab cottage, farm outbuildings (including a dairy, dairy stalls and hay shed) and cultural plantings including peppercorn trees, fruit trees and remnant native vegetation.  Together these elements demonstrate attributes typical of rural lifestyles in Sydney from the early colonial period to the mid twentieth century.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park house is an outstanding representative example of the more modest colonial homesteads built by smaller landholders in NSW. It is little changed since its construction {{circa|1811}} and demonstrates the key characteristics of the type, including brick nogging construction, jerkin-head roof, false chimney to maintain symmetry, wrap-around verandah, and dirt or brick paved ground floor. The slab cottage is also an outstanding representative example of these types of buildings, with much of its early fabric intact.<ref name=nswshr-2009/>\n\nHadley Park also forms part of a group which collectively illustrates a colonial cultural landscape in western Sydney.

After its destruction by [[Genghis Khan]] in 1219, the city was rebuilt and profited from the [[Silk Road]]. From 18th to 19th century, the city became an [[Tashkent (1784)|independent city-state]], before being re-conquered by the [[Khanate of Kokand]]. In 1865, it fell to the [[Russian Empire]], and became the capital of [[Russian Turkestan]]. In [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, Tashkent witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forced deportations]] from throughout the Soviet Union. Much of the city was destroyed in the [[1966 Tashkent earthquake]], though it was rebuilt afterwards as a model Soviet city. It was the fourth-largest city of the Soviet Union at the time, after [[Moscow]], [[Leningrad]] and [[Kiev]].\n\nToday, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a multi-ethnic population, with ethnic [[Uzbeks]] as the majority. In 2009, the city celebrated its 2,200 years of written history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fergananews.com/articles/6299|title=\u042e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430. \u0422\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0432 2200 \u043b\u0435\u0442|website=\u0424\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u2013 \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0430\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n:''See also: [[Timeline of Tashkent]] and {{illm|History of Tashkent|uz|Toshkent tarixi}}''\nDuring its long history, Tashkent has had various changes in names and political and religious affiliations.\n\n===Early history===\nTashkent was settled by ancient people as an [[oasis]] on the [[Chirchik River]], near the foothills of the West [[Tian Shan]] Mountains. In ancient times, this area contained Beitian, probably the summer \"capital\" of the [[Kangju]] confederacy.<ref>Pulleyblank, Edwin G. \"The Consonantal System of Old Chinese,\" ''Asia Major 9'' (1963), p. 94.</ref> Some scholars believe that a [[Stone Tower (Ptolemy)|\"Stone Tower]]\" mentioned by [[Ptolemy]] and by other early accounts of travel on the Silk Road referred to this settlement (\"Tashkent\" means \"stone city\"). This tower is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Riaz|date=2015|title=The Location of Ptolemy's Stone Tower: the Case for Sulaiman-Too in Osh|journal=The Silk Road|volume=13|pages=76}}</ref>\n\n===History as Chach===\nIn pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, the town and the province were known as ''Chach''.  The [[Shahnameh]] of Ferdowsi also refers to the city as Chach.\n\nThe principality of Chach had a [[Square (geometry)|square]] citadel built around the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, some {{convert|8|km}} south of the [[Syr Darya]] River. By the 7th century AD, Chach had more than 30 towns and a network of over 50 canals, forming a trade center between the [[Sogdiana|Sogdians]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nomads. The [[Buddhist]] monk [[Xuanzang]] (602/603? \u2013 664 AD), who travelled from China to India through Central Asia, mentioned the name of the city as {{transl|zh|Zh\u011bsh\u00ed}} ({{lang|zh|\u8d6d\u6642}}. The Chinese chronicles [[Book of Sui]] from the [[History of Northern Dynasties]] and [[Old Book of Tang]], mention a possession called {{transl|zh|Sh\u00ed}} {{lang|zh|\u77f3}} or {{transl|zh|Zh\u011bsh\u00ed}} {{lang|zh|\u8d6d\u6642}} with a capital of the same name since the fifth century AD.<ref>Bichurin, 1950. v. II</ref>\n\nIn 751, the region was conquered by Muslim Arabs.\n\n===Islamic history===\n\nIn the mid-seventh century, the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] [[Persian Empire]] collapsed as a result of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab Muslim conquest of Persia]]. Under the [[Samanid]] [[dynasty]] (819\u2013999), whose founder [[Saman Khuda]] was a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] convert to Islam, the city came to be known as '''Binkath'''. However, the Arabs retained the old name of ''Chach'' for the surrounding region, pronouncing it ''ash-Shash'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0634}}) instead. Kand, qand, kent, kad, kath, kud\u2014all meaning a city\u2014are derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]]/[[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 kanda, meaning a town or a city. They are found in city names such as [[Samarkand]], [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]], [[Panjakent]], [[Khujand]] etc.). After the 16th century, the name evolved from Chachkand/Chashkand to Tashkand. The modern spelling of \"Tashkent\" reflects [[Russian language|Russian]] orthography and 20th-century Soviet influence.\n\n===Mongol conquest and aftermath===\n\nThe city was destroyed by [[Genghis Khan]] in 1219 and lost much of its population as a result of the Mongols' destruction of the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmid Empire]] in 1220.  Under the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and subsequent [[Shaybanid]] dynasties, the city's population and culture gradually revived as a prominent strategic center of scholarship, commerce and trade along the [[Silk Road]].\n\n===Kokand khanate===\nIn 1809, Tashkent was annexed to the [[Khanate of Kokand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/uzbekistan/tashkent/background/history/a/nar/83060059-d12c-48ec-8718-1d6c939451a5/357844|title=History in Tashkent, Uzbekistan|first=Lonely|last=Planet}}</ref> At the time, Tashkent had a population of around 100,000 and was considered the richest city in Central Asia. It prospered greatly through trade with Russia but chafed under Kokand's high taxes. The Tashkent clergy also favored the clergy of [[Bukhara]] over that of Kokand. However, before the [[Emir]] of Bukhara could capitalize on this discontent, the Russian army arrived.\n\n===Tsarist period===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2019}}\n[[File:\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u041d\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e (\u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442).png|thumb|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral was built by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in Tashkent.]] \nIn May 1865, [[Mikhail Grigorevich Chernyayev]] (Cherniaev), acting against the direct orders of the [[tsar]] and outnumbered at least 15\u20131, staged a daring night attack against a city with a wall {{convert|25|km|mi}} long with 11 gates and 30,000 defenders. While a small contingent staged a diversionary attack, the main force penetrated the walls, led by a [[Russian Orthodox]] priest. Although the defense was stiff, the Russians captured the city after two days of heavy fighting and the loss of only 25 dead as opposed to several thousand of the defenders (including [[Alimqul]], the ruler of the Kokand Khanate). Chernyayev dubbed the \"Lion of Tashkent\" by city elders, staged a \"hearts-and-minds\" campaign to win the population over. He abolished taxes for a year, rode unarmed through the streets and bazaars meeting common people, and appointed himself \"Military Governor of Tashkent\", recommending to [[Tsar Alexander II]] that the city become an independent khanate under Russian protection.\n\nThe Tsar liberally rewarded Chernyayev and his men with medals and bonuses, but regarded the impulsive general as a \"loose cannon\", and soon replaced him with General [[Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman]]. Far from being granted independence, Tashkent became the capital of the new territory of [[Russian Turkistan]], with Kaufman as first Governor-General. A [[cantonment]] and Russian settlement were built across the Ankhor Canal from the old city, and Russian settlers and merchants poured in. Tashkent was a center of espionage in the [[Great Game]] rivalry between Russia and the United Kingdom over Central Asia. The [[Turkestan Military District]] was established as part of the military reforms of 1874. The [[Trans-Caspian Railway]] arrived in 1889, and the railway workers who built it settled in Tashkent as well, bringing with them the seeds of [[Bolshevik Revolution]].\n\n===Effect of the Russian revolution===\n[[File:\u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0436 \u0410\u0440\u0438\u0444-\u0425\u043e\u0434\u0436\u0438.jpg|thumb|Tashkent ca.1910]]\nWith the fall of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Russian Provisional Government]] removed all civil restrictions based on religion and nationality, contributing to local enthusiasm for the [[February Revolution]]. The [[Tashkent Soviet]] of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies was soon set up, but primarily represented Russian residents, who made up about a fifth of the Tashkent population. Muslim leaders quickly set up the Tashkent Muslim Council (''Tashkand Shura-yi-Islamiya'') based in the old city. On 10 March 1917, there was a parade with Russian workers marching with red flags, Russian soldiers singing ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' and thousands of local Central Asians. Following various speeches, Governor-General [[Aleksey Kuropatkin]] closed the events with words \"Long Live a great free Russia\".<ref>Jeff Sahadeo, ''Russian Colonial Society in Tashkent,'' Indiana University Press, 2007, p188</ref>\n\nThe First Turkestan Muslim Conference was held in Tashkent 16\u201320 April 1917. Like the Muslim Council, it was dominated by the [[Jadid]], Muslim reformers. A more conservative faction emerged in Tashkent centered around the [[Ulema]]. This faction proved more successful during the local elections of July 1917. They formed an alliance with Russian conservatives, while the Soviet became more radical. The Soviet attempt to seize power in September 1917 proved unsuccessful.<ref>Rex A. Wade, ''The Russian Revolution, 1917,'' Cambridge University Press, 2005</ref>\n\nIn April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic ([[Turkestan ASSR]]). The new regime was threatened by White forces, ''[[basmachi]];'' revolts from within, and purges ordered from Moscow. In 1930, Tashkent fell within the borders of the [[Uzbek SSR]], and became the capital of the Uzbek SSR, displacing [[Samarkand]].\n\n===Soviet period===\n[[File:Tashkent the building of town council 02.jpg|thumb|Tashkent, 1917]]\n[[File:Tashkent. Courage monument. USSR stamp. 1979.jpg|thumb|The Courage Monument in Tashkent on a 1979 Soviet stamp]]\nThe city began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nViolating the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. The government worked to relocate factories from western Russia and Ukraine to Tashkent to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity. This led to great increase in industry during World War II.\n\nIt also evacuated most of the German communist emigres to Tashkent.<ref name=\"shirer\">[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/modlanggerman/3/ Robert K.

On the next day, Shastri died suddenly, reportedly due to a heart attack. It is widely speculated that Shastri was killed by poisoning the water he drank.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nMuch of Tashkent's old city was destroyed by a powerful [[1966 Tashkent earthquake|earthquake on 26 April 1966]].

In his method that had been patented in [[Saratov]] in 1925, Boris Grabovsky proposed a new principle of TV imaging based on the vertical and horizontal electron beam sweeping under high voltage. Nowadays this principle of the TV imaging is used practically in all modern cathode-ray tubes.

Tashkent is just 13&nbsp;km from two border crossings into Kazakhstan. Closest geographic cities with populations of over 1 million are: Shymkent (Kazakhstan), [[Dushanbe]] (Tajikistan), [[Bishkek]] (Kyrgyzstan), [[Kashgar]] (China), [[Almaty]] (Kazakhstan), [[Kabul]] (Afghanistan) and [[Peshawar]] (Pakistan).\n\nTashkent sits at the confluence of the [[Chirchiq River]] and several of its tributaries and is built on deep alluvial deposits up to {{convert|15|m}}. The city is located in an active tectonic area suffering large numbers of tremors and some earthquakes. \n\nThe local time in Tashkent is [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC/GMT]] +5 hours. \n\n===Climate===\nTashkent features a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: Csa)<ref name=\"Koeppen\"/> bordering a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: Dsa).<ref name=\"Koeppen\">[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Asia_K%C3%B6ppen_Map.png Updated Asian map of the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system]</ref> As a result, Tashkent experiences cold and often snowy winters not typically associated with most Mediterranean climates and long, hot and dry summers. Winters are cold and often snowy, covering the months of December, January and February. Most [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs during these months which frequently falls as snow. The city experiences two peaks of precipitation in the early winter and spring. The slightly unusual precipitation pattern is partially due to its 500 m (roughly 1600 feet) altitude. Summers are long in Tashkent, usually lasting from May to September. Tashkent can be extremely hot during the months of July and August. The city also sees very little precipitation during the summer, particularly from June through September.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.tashkent-travel.com/weather\n |title       =

Dating from 655 and stained with the blood of murdered caliph, [[Uthman]], it was brought by Timur to [[Samarkand]], seized by the Russians as a war trophy and taken to [[Saint Petersburg]].

Of more interest is the large collection of paintings \"borrowed\" from the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] by Grand Duke Romanov to decorate his palace in exile in Tashkent, and never returned.

exceeds 2.48m people|publisher=Uzdaily.com}}</ref> It is located in the north-east of the country close to the border with [[Kazakhstan]].\n\nBefore [[Islam]] influence started in the 8th century AD, Tashkent was influenced by the [[Sogdian people|Sogdian]] and [[Turkic people|Turkic]] cultures in its early history. After its destruction by [[Genghis Khan]] in 1219, the city was rebuilt and profited from the [[Silk Road]]. From 18th to 19th century, the city became an [[Tashkent (1784)|independent city-state]], before being re-conquered by the [[Khanate of Kokand]]. In 1865, it fell to the [[Russian Empire]], and became the capital of [[Russian Turkestan]]. In [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, Tashkent witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forced deportations]] from throughout the Soviet Union. Much of the city was destroyed in the [[1966 Tashkent earthquake]], though it was rebuilt afterwards as a model Soviet city. It was the fourth-largest city of the Soviet Union at the time, after [[Moscow]], [[Leningrad]] and [[Kiev]].\n\nToday, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a multi-ethnic population, with ethnic [[Uzbeks]] as the majority. In 2009, the city celebrated its 2,200 years of written history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fergananews.com/articles/6299|title=\u042e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430. \u0422\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0432 2200 \u043b\u0435\u0442|website=\u0424\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u2013 \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0430\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n:''See also: [[Timeline of Tashkent]] and {{illm|History of Tashkent|uz|Toshkent tarixi}}''\nDuring its long history, Tashkent has had various changes in names and political and religious affiliations.\n\n===Early history===\nTashkent was settled by ancient people as an [[oasis]] on the [[Chirchik River]], near the foothills of the West [[Tian Shan]] Mountains. In ancient times, this area contained Beitian, probably the summer \"capital\" of the [[Kangju]] confederacy.<ref>Pulleyblank, Edwin G. \"The Consonantal System of Old Chinese,\" ''Asia Major 9'' (1963), p. 94.</ref> Some scholars believe that a [[Stone Tower (Ptolemy)|\"Stone Tower]]\" mentioned by [[Ptolemy]] and by other early accounts of travel on the Silk Road referred to this settlement (\"Tashkent\" means \"stone city\"). This tower is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Riaz|date=2015|title=The Location of Ptolemy's Stone Tower: the Case for Sulaiman-Too in Osh|journal=The Silk Road|volume=13|pages=76}}</ref>\n\n===History as Chach===\nIn pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, the town and the province were known as ''Chach''.  The [[Shahnameh]] of Ferdowsi also refers to the city as Chach.\n\nThe principality of Chach had a [[Square (geometry)|square]] citadel built around the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, some {{convert|8|km}} south of the [[Syr Darya]] River. By the 7th century AD, Chach had more than 30 towns and a network of over 50 canals, forming a trade center between the [[Sogdiana|Sogdians]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nomads. The [[Buddhist]] monk [[Xuanzang]] (602/603? \u2013 664 AD), who travelled from China to India through Central Asia, mentioned the name of the city as {{transl|zh|Zh\u011bsh\u00ed}} ({{lang|zh|\u8d6d\u6642}}. The Chinese chronicles [[Book of Sui]] from the [[History of Northern Dynasties]] and [[Old Book of Tang]], mention a possession called {{transl|zh|Sh\u00ed}} {{lang|zh|\u77f3}} or {{transl|zh|Zh\u011bsh\u00ed}} {{lang|zh|\u8d6d\u6642}} with a capital of the same name since the fifth century AD.<ref>Bichurin, 1950. v. II</ref>\n\nIn 751, the region was conquered by Muslim Arabs.\n\n===Islamic history===\n\nIn the mid-seventh century, the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] [[Persian Empire]] collapsed as a result of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab Muslim conquest of Persia]]. Under the [[Samanid]] [[dynasty]] (819\u2013999), whose founder [[Saman Khuda]] was a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] convert to Islam, the city came to be known as '''Binkath'''. However, the Arabs retained the old name of ''Chach'' for the surrounding region, pronouncing it ''ash-Shash'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0634}}) instead. Kand, qand, kent, kad, kath, kud\u2014all meaning a city\u2014are derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]]/[[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 kanda, meaning a town or a city. They are found in city names such as [[Samarkand]], [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]], [[Panjakent]], [[Khujand]] etc.). After the 16th century, the name evolved from Chachkand/Chashkand to Tashkand. The modern spelling of \"Tashkent\" reflects [[Russian language|Russian]] orthography and 20th-century Soviet influence.\n\n===Mongol conquest and aftermath===\n\nThe city was destroyed by [[Genghis Khan]] in 1219 and lost much of its population as a result of the Mongols' destruction of the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmid Empire]] in 1220.  Under the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and subsequent [[Shaybanid]] dynasties, the city's population and culture gradually revived as a prominent strategic center of scholarship, commerce and trade along the [[Silk Road]].\n\n===Kokand khanate===\nIn 1809, Tashkent was annexed to the [[Khanate of Kokand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/uzbekistan/tashkent/background/history/a/nar/83060059-d12c-48ec-8718-1d6c939451a5/357844|title=History in Tashkent, Uzbekistan|first=Lonely|last=Planet}}</ref> At the time, Tashkent had a population of around 100,000 and was considered the richest city in Central Asia. It prospered greatly through trade with Russia but chafed under Kokand's high taxes. The Tashkent clergy also favored the clergy of [[Bukhara]] over that of Kokand. However, before the [[Emir]] of Bukhara could capitalize on this discontent, the Russian army arrived.\n\n===Tsarist period===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2019}}\n[[File:\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u041d\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e (\u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442).png|thumb|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral was built by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in Tashkent.]] \nIn May 1865, [[Mikhail Grigorevich Chernyayev]] (Cherniaev), acting against the direct orders of the [[tsar]] and outnumbered at least 15\u20131, staged a daring night attack against a city with a wall {{convert|25|km|mi}} long with 11 gates and 30,000 defenders. While a small contingent staged a diversionary attack, the main force penetrated the walls, led by a [[Russian Orthodox]] priest. Although the defense was stiff, the Russians captured the city after two days of heavy fighting and the loss of only 25 dead as opposed to several thousand of the defenders (including [[Alimqul]], the ruler of the Kokand Khanate). Chernyayev dubbed the \"Lion of Tashkent\" by city elders, staged a \"hearts-and-minds\" campaign to win the population over. He abolished taxes for a year, rode unarmed through the streets and bazaars meeting common people, and appointed himself \"Military Governor of Tashkent\", recommending to [[Tsar Alexander II]] that the city become an independent khanate under Russian protection.\n\nThe Tsar liberally rewarded Chernyayev and his men with medals and bonuses, but regarded the impulsive general as a \"loose cannon\", and soon replaced him with General [[Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman]]. Far from being granted independence, Tashkent became the capital of the new territory of [[Russian Turkistan]], with Kaufman as first Governor-General. A [[cantonment]] and Russian settlement were built across the Ankhor Canal from the old city, and Russian settlers and merchants poured in. Tashkent was a center of espionage in the [[Great Game]] rivalry between Russia and the United Kingdom over Central Asia. The [[Turkestan Military District]] was established as part of the military reforms of 1874. The [[Trans-Caspian Railway]] arrived in 1889, and the railway workers who built it settled in Tashkent as well, bringing with them the seeds of [[Bolshevik Revolution]].\n\n===Effect of the Russian revolution===\n[[File:\u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0436 \u0410\u0440\u0438\u0444-\u0425\u043e\u0434\u0436\u0438.jpg|thumb|Tashkent ca.1910]]\nWith the fall of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Russian Provisional Government]] removed all civil restrictions based on religion and nationality, contributing to local enthusiasm for the [[February Revolution]]. The [[Tashkent Soviet]] of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies was soon set up, but primarily represented Russian residents, who made up about a fifth of the Tashkent population. Muslim leaders quickly set up the Tashkent Muslim Council (''Tashkand Shura-yi-Islamiya'') based in the old city. On 10 March 1917, there was a parade with Russian workers marching with red flags, Russian soldiers singing ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' and thousands of local Central Asians. Following various speeches, Governor-General [[Aleksey Kuropatkin]] closed the events with words \"Long Live a great free Russia\".<ref>Jeff Sahadeo, ''Russian Colonial Society in Tashkent,'' Indiana University Press, 2007, p188</ref>\n\nThe First Turkestan Muslim Conference was held in Tashkent 16\u201320 April 1917. Like the Muslim Council, it was dominated by the [[Jadid]], Muslim reformers. A more conservative faction emerged in Tashkent centered around the [[Ulema]]. This faction proved more successful during the local elections of July 1917. They formed an alliance with Russian conservatives, while the Soviet became more radical. The Soviet attempt to seize power in September 1917 proved unsuccessful.<ref>Rex A. Wade, ''The Russian Revolution, 1917,'' Cambridge University Press, 2005</ref>\n\nIn April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic ([[Turkestan ASSR]]). The new regime was threatened by White forces, ''[[basmachi]];'' revolts from within, and purges ordered from Moscow. In 1930, Tashkent fell within the borders of the [[Uzbek SSR]], and became the capital of the Uzbek SSR, displacing [[Samarkand]].\n\n===Soviet period===\n[[File:Tashkent the building of town council 02.jpg|thumb|Tashkent, 1917]]\n[[File:Tashkent. Courage monument. USSR stamp. 1979.jpg|thumb|The Courage Monument in Tashkent on a 1979 Soviet stamp]]\nThe city began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nViolating the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. The government worked to relocate factories from western Russia and Ukraine to Tashkent to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity. This led to great increase in industry during World War II.\n\nIt also evacuated most of the German communist emigres to Tashkent.<ref name=\"shirer\">[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/modlanggerman/3/ Robert K.

The [[Tashkent Metro]] was also built during this time. About 100,000 new homes were built by 1970,<ref name=\"tga\" /> but the builders occupied many, rather than the homeless residents of Tashkent.

In his method that had been patented in [[Saratov]] in 1925, Boris Grabovsky proposed a new principle of TV imaging based on the vertical and horizontal electron beam sweeping under high voltage. Nowadays this principle of the TV imaging is used practically in all modern cathode-ray tubes.

Tashkent is just 13&nbsp;km from two border crossings into Kazakhstan. Closest geographic cities with populations of over 1 million are: Shymkent (Kazakhstan), [[Dushanbe]] (Tajikistan), [[Bishkek]] (Kyrgyzstan), [[Kashgar]] (China), [[Almaty]] (Kazakhstan), [[Kabul]] (Afghanistan) and [[Peshawar]] (Pakistan).\n\nTashkent sits at the confluence of the [[Chirchiq River]] and several of its tributaries and is built on deep alluvial deposits up to {{convert|15|m}}. The city is located in an active tectonic area suffering large numbers of tremors and some earthquakes. \n\nThe local time in Tashkent is [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC/GMT]] +5 hours. \n\n===Climate===\nTashkent features a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: Csa)<ref name=\"Koeppen\"/> bordering a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: Dsa).<ref name=\"Koeppen\">[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Asia_K%C3%B6ppen_Map.png Updated Asian map of the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system]</ref> As a result, Tashkent experiences cold and often snowy winters not typically associated with most Mediterranean climates and long, hot and dry summers. Winters are cold and often snowy, covering the months of December, January and February. Most [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs during these months which frequently falls as snow. The city experiences two peaks of precipitation in the early winter and spring. The slightly unusual precipitation pattern is partially due to its 500 m (roughly 1600 feet) altitude. Summers are long in Tashkent, usually lasting from May to September. Tashkent can be extremely hot during the months of July and August. The city also sees very little precipitation during the summer, particularly from June through September.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.tashkent-travel.com/weather\n |title       =

Appointments are made from within the legal profession on the basis of merit rather than a particular level of experience. Members have the privilege of sitting within the [[Bar (law)|bar]] of court. As members wear silk gowns of a particular design (see [[court dress]]), appointment as Queen's Counsel is known informally as ''taking silk'', and hence QCs are often colloquially called ''silks''.\n\nThe rank emerged in the sixteenth century, but came to prominence over the course of the nineteenth. Appointment was open to barristers only until 1995. The first women KCs had been appointed only in 1949. In 1951, 20 people were appointed, all of them men.\n\n== 1952 ==\n\n=== 22 April 1952 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n! width=\"20%\" |Name\n! width=\"15%\" |Inns of Court\n! width=\"20%\" |University\n!Notes\n!Ref\n|-\n| height=\"19\" |'''Edward Johnson Rimmer''', [[Associate Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers|AMICE]]\n|Lincoln's Inn (1912)\n|[[University of Liverpool]]\n|Born in 1883, Rimmer went to [[Bickerton House School]] before reading engineering at the [[University of Liverpool]]; he graduated [[Bachelor of Engineering|BEng]] from Liverpool in 1904 and [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] from the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in the same year.

After private schooling and attending [[Cardigan County School]], he studied at the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth, gaining an [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]] in 1933, and at Cambridge, taking a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1935. After being called to the bar in 1937, he practised on the [[South Wales Circuit]] and established chambers in [[Cardiff]]. In the [[World War II|Second World War]], he served as an officer in the [[Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces|Judge Advocate General]]'s Department. On [[Demobilization|demobilisation]], he resumed his legal practice, being [[Recorder of Carmarthen]] (1950\u201353), [[Recorder of Merthyr Tydfil|of Merthyr Tydfil]] (1953\u201360), [[Recorder of Swansea|of Swansea]] (1960\u201364) and [[Recorder of Cardiff|of Cardiff]] (1964\u201367). He was also Chairman of the [[Montgomeryshire]] [[Court of quarter sessions|Quarter Sessions]] (1959\u201371) and Leader of the [[Wales and Chester Circuit]]. Bowen also pursued a political career; he successfully contested the [[Cardigan (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardigan seat]] for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], was the Chairman of the Welsh Parliamentary Party from 1955 and was considered a potential party leader in the mid-1950s, but it was not to be. In 1965, he accepted the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government's offer of the [[Chairman of Ways and Means|Deputy Chairmanship of Ways and Means]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]; as a deputy speaker, he would thereby not vote and this reduced his party's strength without costing the government any more Labour seats (they had a very narrow majority in the chamber). The following year, he was defeated in [[1966 United Kingdom general election|the general election]]. He afterwards carried out investigative work for the government into interrogation procedures used in the British colony of [[Colony of Aden|Aden]]; he also chaired the government committee (after 1972) which recommended bilingual road signs in Wales, and served as a [[National Insurance Commissioner]] for Wales (1967\u201386) and as President of [[St David's College, Lampeter]] (1977\u201392). His later years were spent living reclusively; he never married, nor received political honours, and died in 2001.\n|<ref>\"Roderic Bowen\", ''[[The Times]]'' (London), 24 July 2001, p. 17.</ref>\n\n<ref>John Graham Jones, [https://biography.wales/article/s8-BOWE-ROD-1913 \"Bowen, Evan Roderic\"], ''[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]'' ([[National Library of Wales|The National Library of Wales]], 20 June 2011).
