A [[midfielder]], he played for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] from 1959 to 1976, and captained the side during this time, which was the most successful period of the club's history. \n\nAt Leeds, he won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] (1968\u201369 and 1973\u201374), [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] (1963\u201364), [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] (1968 and 1971), [[FA Cup]] (1972), [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] (1968), and [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]] (1969). The club also finished second in numerous competitions, being runners-up five times in the English league and seven times in cup finals, including the 1975 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. He was also named as the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] in 1970 and was listed on the [[PFA Team of the Year]] in 1973\u201374. He has since been voted Leeds United's [[Leeds United A.F.C. players#Leeds United's 100 greatest players|greatest player of all time]] and has a statue outside the south-east corner of their [[Elland Road]] stadium. He has also been included in the [[Football League 100 Legends]] and is a member of both the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] and [[Scottish Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nHe spent 1976 to 1978 at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], before being appointed player-manager at [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in November 1978. He spent seven years at the helm, guiding the club to promotion out of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1980\u201381 and 1983\u201384, before he took on the manager's job at Leeds United in October 1985. He could not get the club promoted back into the top-flight and left the club in September 1988. He returned to Doncaster in July 1989, ending his second spell in charge in November 1991.\n\nHe is on the [[Scotland national football team roll of honour]] for having won more than 50 caps for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].

December 1942&nbsp;\u2013 7 December 1997) was a Scottish professional [[Association football|footballer]] and manager known for his strength, skills and compact constitution. A [[midfielder]], he played for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] from 1959 to 1976, and captained the side during this time, which was the most successful period of the club's history. \n\nAt Leeds, he won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] (1968\u201369 and 1973\u201374), [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] (1963\u201364), [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] (1968 and 1971), [[FA Cup]] (1972), [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] (1968), and [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]] (1969). The club also finished second in numerous competitions, being runners-up five times in the English league and seven times in cup finals, including the 1975 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. He was also named as the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] in 1970 and was listed on the [[PFA Team of the Year]] in 1973\u201374. He has since been voted Leeds United's [[Leeds United A.F.C. players#Leeds United's 100 greatest players|greatest player of all time]] and has a statue outside the south-east corner of their [[Elland Road]] stadium. He has also been included in the [[Football League 100 Legends]] and is a member of both the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] and [[Scottish Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nHe spent 1976 to 1978 at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], before being appointed player-manager at [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in November 1978. He spent seven years at the helm, guiding the club to promotion out of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1980\u201381 and 1983\u201384, before he took on the manager's job at Leeds United in October 1985. He could not get the club promoted back into the top-flight and left the club in September 1988. He returned to Doncaster in July 1989, ending his second spell in charge in November 1991.\n\nHe is on the [[Scotland national football team roll of honour]] for having won more than 50 caps for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. He captained his country at the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], where Scotland failed to advance from the group stage despite going unbeaten in the competition.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Leeds United===\nBorn in [[Stirling]], [[Stirlingshire]], Scotland, to James and Bridget Bremner, he attended [[St Modan's High School]] and represented Scotland Schoolboys.<ref>{{harvnb|Sutcliffe|2011|p=14}}</ref> His father forbade him from joining [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] as he did not want him involved in the [[Old Firm|religion-based rivalry]] with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], and Bremner rejected both [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] as he did not enjoy his stay in [[London]] during trial spells with the two clubs, and was instead convinced to join [[Bill Lambton]]'s [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 1959.<ref>{{harvnb|Sutcliffe|2011|p=16}}</ref> He joined along with his friend [[Tommy Henderson (footballer, born 1943)|Tommy Henderson]], who would return to Scotland due to homesickness without making a first team debut.<ref>{{harvnb|Sutcliffe|2011|p=18}}</ref> Manager [[Jack Taylor (footballer, born 1914)|Jack Taylor]] gave him his debut at outside-right in a 3\u20131 win against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], at the age of 17 years and 47 days; ''[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]'' reporter Phil Brown noted that Bremner showed \"enthusiasm, guts, intelligence, most accurate use of the ball and unselfishness\" despite poor weather conditions.<ref>{{harvnb|Sutcliffe|2011|p=19}}</ref> A ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' headline later dubbed him as \"[[Stone (unit)|10st]] of barbed wire\" due to his tenacity and tough tackling.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article2215721.ece |title = Football's 50 greatest hard men | date = 7 August 2007 | newspaper = [[The Times]] | location=London  | accessdate=26 April 2010 | first=Alex | last=Murphy}}</ref> Regular outside-right [[Chris Crowe (footballer)|Chris Crowe]] was sold to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in March 1960, allowing Bremner to take his place on a permanent basis.<ref>{{harvnb|Sutcliffe|2011|p=20}}</ref> However, Leeds went on to be relegated from the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] at the end of the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360]] season.\n\nDropped following an opening day defeat by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield]], Bremner had to win back his first team place later in the [[1960\u201361 Football League|1960\u201361]] season after meeting with Jack Taylor to explain his frustration at being left out of the team.<ref>{{harvnb|Sutcliffe|2011|p=21}}</ref> Taylor resigned in March 1961, and player [[Don Revie]] was promoted to manager.<ref>{{harvnb|Sutcliffe|2011|p=23}}</ref> Revie rejected an approach of \u00a325,000 from [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] for Bremner, despite the player wanting to return to Scotland to be with his fianc\u00e9e.<ref name=\"page 26\"/> Leeds struggled in the [[1961\u201362 Football League|1961\u201362]] campaign, finishing just three points above the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] relegation zone, despite 12 goals in 45 appearances from Bremner, who finished as the club's joint top-scorer alongside centre-half [[Jack Charlton]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sutcliffe|2011|p=28}}</ref> One bright spot was the signing of [[Bobby Collins (footballer)|Bobby Collins]] in March, who helped form the \"win-at-all-costs\" attitude that defined Leeds and Bremner throughout the rest of Revie's 13 years as manager.<ref>{{harvnb|Sutcliffe|2011|p=30}}</ref>\n\nUnited had a more promising [[1962\u201363 Football League|1962\u201363]] campaign, finishing four points shy of promotion, though Bremner was limited to 24 appearances.
