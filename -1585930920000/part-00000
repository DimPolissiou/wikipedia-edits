One of his  pupils, a cute and smart 12-year-old boy named Duilio, a farmer's son, gradually grows to love Lorenzo and they become good friends but the boy wishes Lorenzo was his older brother. Lorenzo often visits Duilio's  home, meets his family, and they become good friends. Lorenzo meanwhile meets a young woman, with whom he falls in love. However, the relationship with his girlfriend is not perfect and he chooses to break up with her as she is about to be married. She and her fianc\u00e9 agree to have an open relationship but Lorenzo declines the offer. Meanwhile, Lorenzo becomes much closer to Duilio and they often spend time with each other.  The boy is given books and other things and the boy in turn makes and gives his friend a carved boat and poems.  The boy kisses his teacher in a farm building on the lips. The boy's sister returns and all three become friends. But many things change after Duilio's stepmother begins to distrust Lorenzo and says as much to his father. Gradually, at the request of the boy's father who knows that his son loves his teacher more than his father, they meet less often. Duilio has to work on his father's farm in the afternoon, but Duilio still needs Lorenzo and misses him. To get out of this difficult situation, Lorenzo decides to leave the village and Duilio forever.  His mother realises that the teacher's feelings for the boy are pure and asks to be forgiven.

A love story is then told between two children, Rebecca and Tommy, who swear each other eternal love. When Rebecca departs suddenly for Japan with her mother, the two are separated. Twelve years later, Rebecca returns as a young woman to find that Tommy (Matt Smith) not only remembers her, but still cares deeply for her. The two begin a new relationship.\n\nTommy is a political activist fighting against the [[biotechnology|biotech]] corporations, who plan to open a new natural park populated by animals artificially created by [[cloning]]. Tommy plans to spoil the inauguration ceremony by letting loose rucksacks filled with cockroaches. Rebecca, herself a computer programmer of leak detection sonar software for underground storage containers, insists on accompanying Tommy.\n\nDriving to the site of the new natural park through a lonely wilderness, Rebecca asks Tommy to stop the car so that she can relieve herself at the side of the road. Meantime, Tommy leaves the car and is struck and killed suddenly by a passing vehicle.\n\nRebecca and Tommy's parents are stricken with grief. Rebecca wants to use new scientific advancements to have Tommy cloned and thereby bring him back to life. She offers to be impregnated using Tommy's DNA. Though Tommy's mother objects, his father agrees to give Rebecca Tommy's cell material, but urges her to think through her decision carefully before proceeding. Rebecca, however, continues and gives birth to a new Tommy by [[Caesarean section]].\n\nTommy is now raised as Rebecca's son, and the two have a close relationship. Rebecca presents to him a [[pleo]], an artificial living animal created using new biotechnology. Tommy and his playmates observe a neighbourhood girl and try to determine if she has a \"copy smell\" as the girl is a clone. The neighbourhood mothers display prejudice against \"copies\", expecting Rebecca to not let Tommy associate with them. Rebecca, though horrified, agrees in order not to isolate her son. Eventually rumours about Tommy spread, and Tommy is forced to celebrate his birthday alone with his mother, his playmates all being barred from attending by their mothers.\n\nRebecca moves to a more remote location with Tommy. Tommy begins to ask questions about his father, wanting to know how his father died. He buries the pleo his mother gave him for his birthday while out playing with his friend. His mother finds out and gives him back the pleo, which is now no longer working.\n\nYears later, Tommy has grown as old as his original was when he died. As a result, he starts to manifest certain personality traits and interests of the original Tommy (such as his interests in biology). He is now the adult son of still-youthful Rebecca. When Tommy brings a girlfriend, Monica, home to stay with them Rebecca behaves jealously, to both Tommy's and Monica's bewilderment. Tommy struggles with what appears to be sexual tension [[Oedipus complex|between himself and his mother]]. The original Tommy's mother, now an old woman, arrives unexpectedly and stares silently at Tommy, who feels he recognizes the stranger. Frightened and frustrated by Rebecca's lack of explanation, Tommy lashes out at Rebecca, ignoring Monica, who quickly departs.\n\nAn angry Tommy demands answers from his mother, Rebecca, who gives him original Tommy's old laptop with pictures of himself and his real mother and father (the former he met earlier). Tommy, out of confusion and sexual tension, initiates sex with Rebecca. From the blood on her hand, it is implied he took her virginity in the process. The next day Tommy packs his things, then addresses Rebecca by her first name (and not as \"Mom\") and thanks her for the life he's had and then leaves.

He attended Gambia High School in [[Banjul]] from 1978 to 1983 and served in the [[Gambia Armed Forces|Gambia National Gendarmerie]] from 1984 to 1989. He was then commissioned as an officer of the [[Military of the Gambia|Gambia National Army]], commanding the Military Police from 1992 to 1994. In July 1994, he led a bloodless [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'etat]] that overthrew the government of [[Dawda Jawara]] and installed himself as chairman of AFPRC, a military junta, and ruled by decree until his [[1996 Gambian presidential election|election]] as president in 1996.\n\nJammeh was re-elected as president [[2001 Gambian presidential election|in 2001]], [[2006 Gambian presidential election|2006]] and [[2011 Gambian presidential election|2011]], but lost to [[Adama Barrow]] [[2016 Gambian presidential election|in 2016]]. His time in office saw the authoritarian oppression of anti-government journalists, [[LGBT rights in the Gambia|LGBT people]] and opposition parties. His foreign policy led to a constantly strained relationship with the sole neighbouring country of [[Senegal]]. In 2013, Jammeh withdrew the Gambia from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and in 2016 he began the process of withdrawing it from the [[International Criminal Court]] (later rescinded by the Barrow government).\n\nJammeh is accused of having stolen millions of dollars from the country's coffers to fund a life of luxury. After leaving office, his assets were frozen by many countries and he went into exile. In addition to charges of corruption and human rights violations, he is also accused of having raped a number of young women.\n\n== Early life and military service ==\n\nJammeh was born on 25 May 1965 in [[Kanilai]], a village in the [[Foni Kansala]] district of the [[West Coast Division (Gambia)|Western Division]] of The Gambia. He is the son of Aja Fatou Ashombi Bojang, a housewife and trader, and Abdul Aziz James Junkung Jammeh, a career wrestler. Jammeh's grandparents migrated to the Gambia from the [[Casamance]] region of [[Senegal]].<ref>M'Bai, p. 90</ref> He had a rural upbringing as part of a [[Muslim]] [[Jola people|Jola]] family, primarily focused in Kanilai.

The other three were Sana Sabally, [[Sadibou Hydara]] and Edward Singhateh. The coup, which took place on 22 July, was successful and bloodless, leading to Jawara fleeing into exile.<ref name=\":3\">Hughes and Perfect, p. xxix</ref> Four days later, on 26 July, the [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC) was formed with Jammeh as its chairman.<ref name=\":2\" /> Jammeh promised that it would be a \"coup with a difference\", and that the country would be returned to civilian rule \"as soon as we have set things right\". One result of the coup was that the [[European Union]] and the United States, the major donors of foreign aid to the Gambia, suspended their aid programmes until the country was returned to civil rule. Jammeh claimed the suspension of aid programmes amounted to \"[[neocolonialism]]\". A Western diplomat who spoke to ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, \"This is exactly the same phenomenon we have seen elsewhere, with the only difference being that so far there has been no violence.\" In particular, the coup was compared with [[Samuel Doe]]'s in the [[Liberia]], which led to the [[First Liberian Civil War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 1994 coup d'etat in the Gambia, overthrowing the government of Dawda Jawara, represented a buck in the post-1989 sub-Saharan Africa trend away from authoritarianism and towards multiparty politics.

In November 1994, the same month when Jammeh was formally promoted to the rank of captain, there was an unsuccessful coup attempt by several disaffected young officers leading in numerous deaths, but Jammeh remained in power. The National Consultative Committee (NCC) was appointed on 7 December to review the transition process, and when they reported on 27 January 1995, they recommended a two-year transition period. The same day as the NCC's report, two of the original coup leaders, Sabally and Hydara, launched an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow Jammeh as chairman. Subsequently, Singhateh was appointed as vice-chairman of the AFPRC, and Hydara died in prison on 3 June.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe Constitutional Review Commission (CRC) was appointed in April 1995 and reported to the government in November 1995.

The new constitution, which provided for multiparty elections, an unlimited number of five-year presidential terms, and a lowering of the voting age from 21 to 18, was approved by a majority of 70%. According to Saine, Jammeh would \"[enjoy] unrivalled political and economic power as a consequence of the new constitution.

These include ''Freedom Newspaper'', ''The Gambia Echo'' and ''Gainako''.<ref name=\":62\"/>\n\nJammeh also saw through legislation to restrict the activities of the press. The Newspaper Act 1994 imposed criminal penalties on private publications that failed to pay a yearly registration fee. The National Media Communication Act 2000 forced journalists to reveal confidential sources to police and the judiciary on demand.<ref name=\":8\" /> In December 2004, the Criminal Code (Amendment) Bill 2004 allowed prison terms for defamation and sedition. The same month, the Newspaper (Amendment) Bill 2004 required newspaper proprietors to purchase expensive operating licenses and forcing them to register their homes as [[Security (finance)|security]].\n\nA number of individual journalists were also targeted. In December 2004, [[Deyda Hydara]], then editor of [[The Point (the Gambia)|''The Point'']], announced his intention to publicly challenge newly-introduced legislation restricting press freedoms.

He attended Gambia High School in [[Banjul]] from 1978 to 1983 and served in the [[Gambia Armed Forces|Gambia National Gendarmerie]] from 1984 to 1989. He was then commissioned as an officer of the [[Military of the Gambia|Gambia National Army]], commanding the Military Police from 1992 to 1994. In July 1994, he led a bloodless [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'etat]] that overthrew the government of [[Dawda Jawara]] and installed himself as chairman of AFPRC, a military junta, and ruled by decree until his [[1996 Gambian presidential election|election]] as president in 1996.\n\nJammeh was re-elected as president [[2001 Gambian presidential election|in 2001]], [[2006 Gambian presidential election|2006]] and [[2011 Gambian presidential election|2011]], but lost to [[Adama Barrow]] [[2016 Gambian presidential election|in 2016]]. His time in office saw the authoritarian oppression of anti-government journalists, [[LGBT rights in the Gambia|LGBT people]] and opposition parties. His foreign policy led to a constantly strained relationship with the sole neighbouring country of [[Senegal]]. In 2013, Jammeh withdrew the Gambia from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and in 2016 he began the process of withdrawing it from the [[International Criminal Court]] (later rescinded by the Barrow government).\n\nJammeh is accused of having stolen millions of dollars from the country's coffers to fund a life of luxury. After leaving office, his assets were frozen by many countries and he went into exile. In addition to charges of corruption and human rights violations, he is also accused of having raped a number of young women.\n\n== Early life and military service ==\n\nJammeh was born on 25 May 1965 in [[Kanilai]], a village in the [[Foni Kansala]] district of the [[West Coast Division (Gambia)|Western Division]] of The Gambia. He is the son of Aja Fatou Ashombi Bojang, a housewife and trader, and Abdul Aziz James Junkung Jammeh, a career wrestler. Jammeh's grandparents migrated to the Gambia from the [[Casamance]] region of [[Senegal]].<ref>M'Bai, p. 90</ref> He had a rural upbringing as part of a [[Muslim]] [[Jola people|Jola]] family, primarily focused in Kanilai.

The other three were Sana Sabally, [[Sadibou Hydara]] and Edward Singhateh. The coup, which took place on 22 July, was successful and bloodless, leading to Jawara fleeing into exile.<ref name=\":3\">Hughes and Perfect, p. xxix</ref> Four days later, on 26 July, the [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC) was formed with Jammeh as its chairman.<ref name=\":2\" /> Jammeh promised that it would be a \"coup with a difference\", and that the country would be returned to civilian rule \"as soon as we have set things right\". One result of the coup was that the [[European Union]] and the United States, the major donors of foreign aid to the Gambia, suspended their aid programmes until the country was returned to civil rule. Jammeh claimed the suspension of aid programmes amounted to \"[[neocolonialism]]\". A Western diplomat who spoke to ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, \"This is exactly the same phenomenon we have seen elsewhere, with the only difference being that so far there has been no violence.\" In particular, the coup was compared with [[Samuel Doe]]'s in the [[Liberia]], which led to the [[First Liberian Civil War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 1994 coup d'etat in the Gambia, overthrowing the government of Dawda Jawara, represented a buck in the post-1989 sub-Saharan Africa trend away from authoritarianism and towards multiparty politics.

In November 1994, the same month when Jammeh was formally promoted to the rank of captain, there was an unsuccessful coup attempt by several disaffected young officers leading in numerous deaths, but Jammeh remained in power. The National Consultative Committee (NCC) was appointed on 7 December to review the transition process, and when they reported on 27 January 1995, they recommended a two-year transition period. The same day as the NCC's report, two of the original coup leaders, Sabally and Hydara, launched an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow Jammeh as chairman. Subsequently, Singhateh was appointed as vice-chairman of the AFPRC, and Hydara died in prison on 3 June.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe Constitutional Review Commission (CRC) was appointed in April 1995 and reported to the government in November 1995.

The new constitution, which provided for multiparty elections, an unlimited number of five-year presidential terms, and a lowering of the voting age from 21 to 18, was approved by a majority of 70%. According to Saine, Jammeh would \"[enjoy] unrivalled political and economic power as a consequence of the new constitution.

These include ''Freedom Newspaper'', ''The Gambia Echo'' and ''Gainako''.<ref name=\":62\"/>\n\nJammeh also saw through legislation to restrict the activities of the press. The Newspaper Act 1994 imposed criminal penalties on private publications that failed to pay a yearly registration fee. The National Media Communication Act 2000 forced journalists to reveal confidential sources to police and the judiciary on demand.<ref name=\":8\" /> In December 2004, the Criminal Code (Amendment) Bill 2004 allowed prison terms for defamation and sedition. The same month, the Newspaper (Amendment) Bill 2004 required newspaper proprietors to purchase expensive operating licenses and forcing them to register their homes as [[Security (finance)|security]].\n\nA number of individual journalists were also targeted. In December 2004, [[Deyda Hydara]], then editor of [[The Point (the Gambia)|''The Point'']], announced his intention to publicly challenge newly-introduced legislation restricting press freedoms.

The film was directed by [[Lloyd Kaufman]] from a screenplay by Kaufman and [[James Gunn]], who also served as [[Assistant director|associate director]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesgunn.com/tromeo-juliet/|title=Tromeo & Juliet|last=Blackehart|first=Stephen|work=jamesgunn.com|accessdate=September 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe film is more or less a faithful adaptation of the play except with the addition of extreme amounts of Troma-esque sexuality and violence, as well as a revised ending. The film's title is a [[portmanteau]] of \"[[Troma]]\" and \"''Romeo and Juliet''\".\n\n==Plot==\nSet in modern-day [[Manhattan]], the film begins with the [[narrator]] ([[Lemmy]] of [[Mot\u00f6rhead]]) introducing two families: the Capulets and the Ques.\n\nAt the center of these families are [[Romeo Montague|Tromeo Que]] and [[Juliet Capulet]]. Tromeo lives in squalor with his alcoholic father Monty and works at a tattoo parlor with his cousin [[Benvolio|Benny]] and friend [[Mercutio|Murray]]. Juliet is sequestered in her family's mansion, watched over by her abusive father [[Lord Capulet|Cappy]], passive mother [[Lady Capulet|Ingrid]], and overprotective cousin [[Tybalt|Tyrone]], all the while being sexually satisfied by family servant Ness ([[Debbie Rochon]]).\n\nBoth Tromeo and Juliet are trapped in cases of [[unrequited love]]: Tromeo lusts for the big-bosomed, promiscuous [[Rosaline|Rosie]]; Juliet is engaged to wealthy [[meat]] tycoon [[Count Paris|London Arbuckle]] as prelude to an [[arranged marriage]].\n\nIn the meantime, a bloody brawl between Murray and Sammy Capulet catches the attention of [[Prince Escalus|Detective Ernie Scalus]], who gathers the heads of the two families together and declares that they will be held personally accountable for any further breaches of peace. Almost immediately afterwards, Monty and Cappy start threatening each other with weapons. Sammy gets caught in the window of Monty's speeding car, where he is thrown head-first into a fire hydrant and (very slowly) dies.\n\nOn the insistence of Murray and Benny, Tromeo attends the Capulets' masquerade ball in the hopes of meeting Rosie, only to find another man performing [[cunnilingus]] on her. Tromeo staggers around the party in disillusion until he locks eyes with those of Juliet. The two instantly fall for each other and share a dance until an angry Tyrone chases him out of the house.\n\nTromeo and Juliet continue to be enamored by one another from afar. Cappy, disgusted at his daughter's active [[libido]], forcefully imprisons her in a plastic cage as punishment. Tromeo sneaks into the house of Capulet and the two meet once again. After proclaiming their love for each other both verbally and [[sexual intercourse|physically]], they agree to be married. Juliet breaks her engagement with Arbuckle and, with the help of [[Friar Lawrence|Father Lawrence]], the two are married in secrecy the next day.\n\nTyrone, upon discovering Juliet's secret affair, gathers his gang together and accuses Tromeo of [[bridenapping]]. Now a kinsman to the Capulets, Tromeo refuses to surrender Juliet back to Arbuckle, suggesting to both sides to bring the lifelong feud to an end. Murray tries to intervene to save Tromeo's life but, in the ensuing brawl, is mortally wounded by Tyrone's club. Tromeo, enraged by his friend's death, pursues Tyrone and slays him (through a series of car crashes which dismember him) and goes into hiding from the police. However, after receiving information from Ness, Detective Scalus declares a [[manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] for Tromeo to ensure that Tyrone's sacrifice won't be in vain on Cappy's behalf.\n\nLearning that she is involved with Tromeo, Cappy savagely beats Juliet and forces her to reconcile with Arbuckle, or he will be threatened to disown her if she resists. With the help of Cappy, Arbuckle accepts her re-proposal and the marriage is set. Juliet visits Father Lawrence, who reunites her with Tromeo and enlists the help of Fu Chang, the [[apothecary]], who sells Juliet a special potion which will aid her predicament.\n\nOn the day of her wedding, Juliet swallows the apothecary's potion, transforming her into a hideous cow monster (complete with a three-foot [[penis]]). The mere sight of her causes Arbuckle to leap out of Juliet's window in fright, committing suicide in the process. Enraged over the loss of his would-be son-in-law and meat inheritance, Cappy has no choice but to end his relationship with Juliet by committing her murder, but Tromeo arrives just in time, knocking Cappy unconscious and bringing Juliet's appearance back to normal by a single kiss. Cappy suddenly awakens and takes the lovers captive with a [[crossbow]]. Eventually, Juliet performs one last act of defiance against her father by electrocuting him to death with a computer monitor. After the final battle, Detective Scalus is impressed of Tromeo and Juliet's teamwork of clearing his name and therefore satisfied to see the end of Cappy's criminal empire, pardoning Tromeo of murder while ordering for Peter, Ness and Rosie to be put in jail as Cappy's accomplices.\n\nWith Cappy's criminal empire defeated, Tromeo and Juliet embrace victoriously until they are stopped short by Ingrid and Monty, who reveal to them the real reason behind the Capulet/Que feud: Long ago, Cappy and Monty were the owners of the successful Silky Films production company. Ingrid, married to Monty at time, struck up an affair with Cappy, eventually birthing a son which Monty raised as his own. Faced with a divorce from Ingrid and the threat of having his son taken away from him, Monty was forced to sign over all the rights of Silky Films to the Capulets in exchange for his son. After the initial shock at the revelation that they are siblings, Tromeo and Juliet are determined not to let their whole ordeal be for naught; they [[incest|passionately embrace]] and drive off into the sunset.\n\nThe film picks up six years later in Tromaville, New Jersey, where Tromeo and Juliet, now married, have become suburban [[yuppie]]s with a house and (birth defected/deformed) children of their own.\n\nThe film ends with the narrator's brief poem for the lovers: ''\"And all of our hearts free to let all things base go/As taught by Juliet and her Tromeo\"''. A brief shot of William Shakespeare laughing uproariously is shown before the end credits.\n\n==Cast==\n {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! Actor !!

A scene featuring [[Ron Jeremy]] as a homeless man was filmed but ultimately deleted from the final cut of the movie.\n\n==Production==\nThe first draft of ''Tromeo and Juliet'' surfaced in 1992, written by Kaufman and Troma employees Andy Deemer and Phil Rivo, written entirely in Shakespearean verse and supposedly featuring The Toxic Avenger as a side character. The feedback from other Troma employees and Michael Herz was unanimously negative, so the idea was scrapped.\n\nIn 1995, another shot was taken at the concept, this time by newbie screenwriter [[James Gunn]].

The film was directed by [[Lloyd Kaufman]] from a screenplay by Kaufman and [[James Gunn]], who also served as [[Assistant director|associate director]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesgunn.com/tromeo-juliet/|title=Tromeo & Juliet|last=Blackehart|first=Stephen|work=jamesgunn.com|accessdate=September 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe film is more or less a faithful adaptation of the play except with the addition of extreme amounts of Troma-esque sexuality and violence, as well as a revised ending. The film's title is a [[portmanteau]] of \"[[Troma]]\" and \"''Romeo and Juliet''\".\n\n==Plot==\nSet in modern-day [[Manhattan]], the film begins with the [[narrator]] ([[Lemmy]] of [[Mot\u00f6rhead]]) introducing two families: the Capulets and the Ques.\n\nAt the center of these families are [[Romeo Montague|Tromeo Que]] and [[Juliet Capulet]]. Tromeo lives in squalor with his alcoholic father Monty and works at a tattoo parlor with his cousin [[Benvolio|Benny]] and friend [[Mercutio|Murray]]. Juliet is sequestered in her family's mansion, watched over by her abusive father [[Lord Capulet|Cappy]], passive mother [[Lady Capulet|Ingrid]], and overprotective cousin [[Tybalt|Tyrone]], all the while being sexually satisfied by family servant Ness ([[Debbie Rochon]]).\n\nBoth Tromeo and Juliet are trapped in cases of [[unrequited love]]: Tromeo lusts for the big-bosomed, promiscuous [[Rosaline|Rosie]]; Juliet is engaged to wealthy [[meat]] tycoon [[Count Paris|London Arbuckle]] as prelude to an [[arranged marriage]].\n\nIn the meantime, a bloody brawl between Murray and Sammy Capulet catches the attention of [[Prince Escalus|Detective Ernie Scalus]], who gathers the heads of the two families together and declares that they will be held personally accountable for any further breaches of peace. Almost immediately afterwards, Monty and Cappy start threatening each other with weapons. Sammy gets caught in the window of Monty's speeding car, where he is thrown head-first into a fire hydrant and (very slowly) dies.\n\nOn the insistence of Murray and Benny, Tromeo attends the Capulets' masquerade ball in the hopes of meeting Rosie, only to find another man performing [[cunnilingus]] on her. Tromeo staggers around the party in disillusion until he locks eyes with those of Juliet. The two instantly fall for each other and share a dance until an angry Tyrone chases him out of the house.\n\nTromeo and Juliet continue to be enamored by one another from afar. Cappy, disgusted at his daughter's active [[libido]], forcefully imprisons her in a plastic cage as punishment. Tromeo sneaks into the house of Capulet and the two meet once again. After proclaiming their love for each other both verbally and [[sexual intercourse|physically]], they agree to be married. Juliet breaks her engagement with Arbuckle and, with the help of [[Friar Lawrence|Father Lawrence]], the two are married in secrecy the next day.\n\nTyrone, upon discovering Juliet\u2018s secret affair, gathers his gang together and accuses Tromeo of [[bridenapping]]. Now a kinsman to the Capulets, Tromeo refuses to surrender Juliet back to Arbuckle, suggesting to both sides to bring the lifelong feud to an end. Murray tries to intervene to save Tromeo's life but, in the ensuing brawl, is mortally wounded by Tyrone\u2018s club. Tromeo, enraged by his friend's death, pursues Tyrone and slays him (through a series of car crashes which dismember him) and goes into hiding from the police. However, after receiving information from Ness, Detective Scalus declares a [[manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] for Tromeo to ensure that Tyrone's sacrifice won't be in vain on Cappy's behalf.\n\nLearning that she is involved with Tromeo, Cappy savagely beats Juliet and forces her to reconcile with Arbuckle, or he will be threatened to disown her if she resists. With the help of Cappy, Arbuckle accepts her re-proposal and the marriage is set. Juliet visits Father Lawrence, who reunites her with Tromeo and enlists the help of Fu Chang, the [[apothecary]], who sells Juliet a special potion which will aid her predicament.\n\nOn the day of her wedding, Juliet swallows the apothecary's potion, transforming her into a hideous cow monster (complete with a three-foot [[penis]]). The mere sight of her causes Arbuckle to leap out of Juliet's window in fright, committing suicide in the process. Enraged over the loss of his would-be son-in-law and meat inheritance, Cappy has no choice but to end his relationship with Juliet by committing her murder, but Tromeo arrives just in time, knocking Cappy unconscious and bringing Juliet's appearance back to normal by a single kiss. Cappy suddenly awakens and takes the lovers captive with a [[crossbow]]. Eventually, Juliet performs one last act of defiance against her father by electrocuting him to death with a computer monitor. After the final battle, Detective Scalus is impressed of Tromeo and Juliet's teamwork of clearing his name and therefore satisfied to see the end of Cappy's criminal empire, pardoning Tromeo of murder while ordering for Peter, Ness and Rosie to be put in jail as Cappy's accomplices.\n\nWith Cappy's criminal empire defeated, Tromeo and Juliet embrace victoriously until they are stopped short by Ingrid and Monty, who reveal to them the real reason behind the Capulet/Que feud: Long ago, Cappy and Monty were the owners of the successful Silky Films production company. Ingrid, married to Monty at time, struck up an affair with Cappy, eventually birthing a son which Monty raised as his own. Faced with a divorce from Ingrid and the threat of having his son taken away from him, Monty was forced to sign over all the rights of Silky Films to the Capulets in exchange for his son. After the initial shock at the revelation that they are siblings, Tromeo and Juliet are determined not to let their whole ordeal be for naught; they [[incest|passionately embrace]] and drive off into the sunset.\n\nThe film picks up six years later in Tromaville, New Jersey, where Tromeo and Juliet, now married, have become suburban [[yuppie]]s with a house and (birth defected/deformed) children of their own.\n\nThe film ends with the narrator's brief poem for the lovers: ''\"And all of our hearts free to let all things base go/As taught by Juliet and her Tromeo\"''. A brief shot of William Shakespeare laughing uproariously is shown before the end credits.\n\n==Cast==\n {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! Actor !!

The feedback from other Troma employees and Michael Herz was unanimously negative, so the idea was scrapped.\n\nIn 1995, another shot was taken at the concept, this time by newbie screenwriter [[James Gunn]].
