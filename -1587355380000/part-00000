A minimum standard of academic attainment may be required for entry, for certain technical roles, or for entry to train for a leadership position as a [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]]. Candidates who meet the criteria will normally also undergo [[Aptitude|aptitude test]], [[medical examination]], psychological interview, job interview and fitness assessment.\n\nDepending on whether the application criteria are met, and depending also on which military units have vacancies for new recruits, candidates may or may not be offered a job in a certain role or roles. Candidates who accept a job offer then wait for their [[recruit training]] to begin. Either at or before the start of their training, candidates swear or affirm an [[oath of allegiance]] and/or sign their joining papers.\n\nThe period between the initial application to swearing the oath may be several weeks or months. During this time many candidates drop out. For example, in 2017 about 1 in 20 applicants to the British Army were eventually enlisted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, ref.

Today there are thousands of recruiting stations across the United States, serving the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force.  Recruiting offices normally consist of 2\u20138 recruiters between the ranks of E-5 and E-7.  When a potential applicant walks into a recruiting station his or her height and weight are checked and their background investigated.  A finger print scan is conducted and a practice ASVAB exam is given to them.  Applicants can not officially swear their enlistment oath in the recruiting office.

Padilla and Mary Riege Laner define six basic appeals to these recruitment campaigns: [[patriotism]], job/career/education, adventure/challenge, [[social status]], travel, and miscellaneous.  Between 1915 and 1918, 42% of all army recruitment posters were themed primarily by patriotism.<ref name=\"Padilla, Peter A 1953.

With no war calling men and women to duty, the United States refocused its recruitment efforts to present the military as a career option, and as a means of achieving a higher education. A majority \u2013 55% \u2013 of all recruitment posters would serve this end. And though peacetime would not last, factors such as the move to an all-volunteer military would ultimately keep career-oriented recruitment efforts in place.<ref>Padilla, Peter A. and Mary Riege Laner. \"Trends in Military Influences on Army Recruitment: 1915-1953.\" Sociological Inquiry, Vol. 71, No. 4. Fall 2001421-36. Austin: University of Texas Press. Page 433</ref>  The Defense Department turned to television syndication as a recruiting aid from 1957\u20131960 with a filmed show, ''[[Country Style, USA]]''.\n\nOn February 20, 1970, the [[Project VOLAR|President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force]] unanimously agreed that the United States would be best served by an all-volunteer military. In supporting this recommendation, the committee noted that recruitment efforts would have to be intensified, as new enlistees would need to be ''convinced'' rather than ''conscripted''. Much like the post-World War II era, these new campaigns put a stronger emphasis on job opportunity. As such, the committee recommended \"improved basic compensation and conditions of service, proficiency pay, and accelerated promotions for the highly skilled to make military career opportunities more attractive.\" These new directives were to be combined with \"an intensive recruiting effort.\"<ref>The Report of the President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1970. Page 18.</ref>   Finalized in mid-1973, the recruitment of a \"professional\" military was met with success. In 1975 and 1976, military enlistments exceeded expectations, with over 365,000 men and women entering the military. Though this may, in part, have been the result of a lack of civilian jobs during the recession, it nevertheless stands to underline the ways in which recruiting efforts responded to the circumstances of the time.<ref>Bliven, Bruce Jr. Volunteers, One and All. New York: Readers Digest Press, 1976. {{ISBN|0-88349-058-7}}</ref>\n\nIndeed, recommendations made by the President's Commission continue to work in present-day recruitment efforts. Understanding the need for greater individual incentive, the US military has re-packaged the benefits of the [[GI Bill]]. Though originally intended as compensation for service, the bill is now seen as a recruiting tool. Today, the GI Bill is \"no longer a reward for service rendered, but an inducement to serve and has become a significant part of recruiter's pitches.\"<ref>White, John B. Lieutenant Commander, US Naval Reserve, Ph. D. \"The GI Bill: Recruiting Bonus, Retention Onus.\" Military Review, July\u2013August 2004.</ref>\n\n====Recruiting methods====\n\nRecruitment can be conducted over the telephone with organized lists, through email campaigns and from face to face prospecting. While telephone prospecting is the most efficient, face to face prospecting is the most effective. Military recruiters often set up booths at amusement parks, sports stadiums and other attractions. In recent years social media has been more commonly used.\n\n====Controversy====\n{{Main|Counter-recruitment#Arguments surrounding recruitment}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Military recruitment}}\n[[Image:Floor area and war recruitment posters at Columbia Institute of War and Peace Studies.jpg|thumb|right|World War I recruitment posters featured as part of the decor at the [[Institute of War and Peace Studies]] at [[Columbia University]], as part of understanding the psychological forces behind recruiting efforts]]\n\n=== Related military articles ===\n* [[Military service]]\n* [[Women in the military]]\n* [[Children in the military]]\n* [[Transgender people and military service]]\n* [[Counter-recruitment]]\n* [[Conscription]] and [[Impressment]]\n* [[Recruit training]]\n* [[Military science]]\n\n===Recruitment methods and campaigns===\n\n==== United States ====\n* [[Conscription in the United States]]\n* ''[[America's Army]]'' (recruitment game)\n* [[Slogans of the United States Army]]\n\n==== Other states ====\n* UK: [[Be All You Can Be]]\n* [[Canada First Defence Strategy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\nManigart, Philippe.\n\"Risks and Recruitment in Postmodern Armed Forces: The Case of Belgium.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jul 2005; vol. 31: pp.&nbsp;559\u2013582.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/4/559\n\nDandeker, Christopher and Alan Strachan.\n\"Soldier Recruitment to the British Army: a Spatial and Social Methodology for Analysis and Monitoring.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jan 1993; vol. 19: pp.&nbsp;279\u2013290.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/19/2/279\n\nSnyder, William P.\n\"Officer Recruitment for the All-Volunteer Force: Trends and Prospects.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Apr 1984; vol. 10: pp.&nbsp;401\u2013425.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/3/401\n\nGriffith, James.\n\"Institutional Motives for Serving in the U.S. Army National Guard: Implications for Recruitment, Retention, and Readiness.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jan 2008; vol. 34: pp.&nbsp;230\u2013258.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/2/230\n\nFitzgerald, John A.\n\"Changing Patterns of Officer Recruitment at the U.S. Naval Academy.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Oct 1981; vol. 8: pp.&nbsp;111\u2013128.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/1/111\n\nEighmey, John.\n\"Why Do Youth Enlist?: Identification of Underlying Themes.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jan 2006; vol. 32: pp.&nbsp;307\u2013328.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/32/2/307\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Military Recruitment}}\n[[Category:Military recruitment| ]]\n[[Category:Recruitment]]\n[[Category:Military personnel]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|compulsory military service|Conscription}}\n[[File:Affiche recrutement Troupes de Marine.jpg|thumb|[[Troupes de Marine|French marines]] recruitement poster]]\n[[File:US Navy recruitment advert in Popular Mechanics 1908.png|thumb|[[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] recruitment advertisement in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', 1908.]]\n'''Military recruitment''' refers to the activity of attracting people to, and selecting them for, [[Recruit training|military training]] and [[Military service|employment]]<nowiki/>.\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n=== Gender ===\n{{Main|Women in the military by country}}{{See also|Women in the military|Transgender people and military service|Women in combat}}\nAcross the world, the large majority of recruits to state [[armed forces]] and [[Violent non-state actor|non-state armed groups]] are male.

A minimum standard of academic attainment may be required for entry, for certain technical roles, or for entry to train for a leadership position as a [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]]. Candidates who meet the criteria will normally also undergo [[Aptitude|aptitude test]], [[medical examination]], psychological interview, job interview and fitness assessment.\n\nDepending on whether the application criteria are met, and depending also on which military units have vacancies for new recruits, candidates may or may not be offered a job in a certain role or roles. Candidates who accept a job offer then wait for their [[recruit training]] to begin. Either at or before the start of their training, candidates swear or affirm an [[oath of allegiance]] and/or sign their joining papers.\n\nThe period between the initial application to swearing the oath may be several weeks or months. During this time many candidates drop out. For example, in 2017 about 1 in 20 applicants to the British Army were eventually enlisted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, ref.

Today there are thousands of recruiting stations across the United States, serving the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force.  Recruiting offices normally consist of 2\u20138 recruiters between the ranks of E-5 and E-7.  When a potential applicant walks into a recruiting station his or her height and weight are checked and their background investigated.  A finger print scan is conducted and a practice ASVAB exam is given to them.  Applicants can not officially swear their enlistment oath in the recruiting office.  This is conducted at a Military Entrance Processing Station \u2013 MEPS.\n\n=== Wartime recruitment strategies in the US ===\n{{Further|Recruitment in the United States Military|Conscription in the United States}}\n[[File:Find the range of your patriotism2.jpg|thumb|[[United States Navy]] recruitment poster from 1918. Note the appeal to [[patriotism]]. (Digitally restored).]]\nPrior to the outbreak of World War I, military recruitment in the US was conducted primarily by individual states.<ref name=\"Padilla, Peter A 1953. Page 423\">Padilla, Peter A. and Mary Riege Laner. \u201cTrends in Military Influences on Army Recruitment: 1915-1953.\u201d Sociological Inquiry, Vol. 71, No. 4. Fall 2001421-36. Austin: University of Texas Press. Page 423</ref> Upon entering the war, however, the federal government took an increased role.\n\nThe increased emphasis on a national effort was reflected in World War I recruitment methods. Peter A. Padilla and Mary Riege Laner define six basic appeals to these recruitment campaigns: [[patriotism]], job/career/education, adventure/challenge, [[social status]], travel, and miscellaneous.  Between 1915 and 1918, 42% of all army recruitment posters were themed primarily by patriotism.<ref name=\"Padilla, Peter A 1953. Page 423\"/> And though other themes \u2013 such as adventure and greater social status \u2013 would play an increased role during World War II recruitment, appeals to serve one's country remained the dominant selling point.\n\n====Recruitment without conscription====\nIn the [[aftermath of World War II]] military recruitment shifted significantly. With no war calling men and women to duty, the United States refocused its recruitment efforts to present the military as a career option, and as a means of achieving a higher education. A majority \u2013 55% \u2013 of all recruitment posters would serve this end. And though peacetime would not last, factors such as the move to an all-volunteer military would ultimately keep career-oriented recruitment efforts in place.<ref>Padilla, Peter A. and Mary Riege Laner. \"Trends in Military Influences on Army Recruitment: 1915-1953.\" Sociological Inquiry, Vol. 71, No. 4. Fall 2001421-36. Austin: University of Texas Press. Page 433</ref>  The Defense Department turned to television syndication as a recruiting aid from 1957\u20131960 with a filmed show, ''[[Country Style, USA]]''.\n\nOn February 20, 1970, the [[Project VOLAR|President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force]] unanimously agreed that the United States would be best served by an all-volunteer military. In supporting this recommendation, the committee noted that recruitment efforts would have to be intensified, as new enlistees would need to be ''convinced'' rather than ''conscripted''. Much like the post-World War II era, these new campaigns put a stronger emphasis on job opportunity. As such, the committee recommended \"improved basic compensation and conditions of service, proficiency pay, and accelerated promotions for the highly skilled to make military career opportunities more attractive.\" These new directives were to be combined with \"an intensive recruiting effort.\"<ref>The Report of the President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1970. Page 18.</ref>   Finalized in mid-1973, the recruitment of a \"professional\" military was met with success. In 1975 and 1976, military enlistments exceeded expectations, with over 365,000 men and women entering the military. Though this may, in part, have been the result of a lack of civilian jobs during the recession, it nevertheless stands to underline the ways in which recruiting efforts responded to the circumstances of the time.<ref>Bliven, Bruce Jr. Volunteers, One and All. New York: Readers Digest Press, 1976. {{ISBN|0-88349-058-7}}</ref>\n\nIndeed, recommendations made by the President's Commission continue to work in present-day recruitment efforts. Understanding the need for greater individual incentive, the US military has re-packaged the benefits of the [[GI Bill]]. Though originally intended as compensation for service, the bill is now seen as a recruiting tool. Today, the GI Bill is \"no longer a reward for service rendered, but an inducement to serve and has become a significant part of recruiter's pitches.\"<ref>White, John B. Lieutenant Commander, US Naval Reserve, Ph. D. \"The GI Bill: Recruiting Bonus, Retention Onus.\" Military Review, July\u2013August 2004.</ref>\n\n====Recruiting methods====\n\nRecruitment can be conducted over the telephone with organized lists, through email campaigns and from face to face prospecting. While telephone prospecting is the most efficient, face to face prospecting is the most effective. Military recruiters often set up booths at amusement parks, sports stadiums and other attractions. In recent years social media has been more commonly used.\n\n====Controversy====\n{{Main|Counter-recruitment#Arguments surrounding recruitment}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Military recruitment}}\n[[Image:Floor area and war recruitment posters at Columbia Institute of War and Peace Studies.jpg|thumb|right|World War I recruitment posters featured as part of the decor at the [[Institute of War and Peace Studies]] at [[Columbia University]], as part of understanding the psychological forces behind recruiting efforts]]\n\n=== Related military articles ===\n* [[Military service]]\n* [[Women in the military]]\n* [[Children in the military]]\n* [[Transgender people and military service]]\n* [[Counter-recruitment]]\n* [[Conscription]] and [[Impressment]]\n* [[Recruit training]]\n* [[Military science]]\n\n===Recruitment methods and campaigns===\n\n==== United States ====\n* [[Conscription in the United States]]\n* ''[[America's Army]]'' (recruitment game)\n* [[Slogans of the United States Army]]\n\n==== Other states ====\n* UK: [[Be All You Can Be]]\n* [[Canada First Defence Strategy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\nManigart, Philippe.\n\"Risks and Recruitment in Postmodern Armed Forces: The Case of Belgium.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jul 2005; vol. 31: pp.&nbsp;559\u2013582.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/4/559\n\nDandeker, Christopher and Alan Strachan.\n\"Soldier Recruitment to the British Army: a Spatial and Social Methodology for Analysis and Monitoring.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jan 1993; vol. 19: pp.&nbsp;279\u2013290.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/19/2/279\n\nSnyder, William P.\n\"Officer Recruitment for the All-Volunteer Force: Trends and Prospects.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Apr 1984; vol. 10: pp.&nbsp;401\u2013425.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/3/401\n\nGriffith, James.\n\"Institutional Motives for Serving in the U.S. Army National Guard: Implications for Recruitment, Retention, and Readiness.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jan 2008; vol. 34: pp.&nbsp;230\u2013258.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/2/230\n\nFitzgerald, John A.\n\"Changing Patterns of Officer Recruitment at the U.S. Naval Academy.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Oct 1981; vol. 8: pp.&nbsp;111\u2013128.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/1/111\n\nEighmey, John.\n\"Why Do Youth Enlist?: Identification of Underlying Themes.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jan 2006; vol. 32: pp.&nbsp;307\u2013328.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/32/2/307\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Military Recruitment}}\n[[Category:Military recruitment| ]]\n[[Category:Recruitment]]\n[[Category:Military personnel]]\n", "name_user": "IR2017", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSocio-economic background", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_recruitment"}

With 'Kil' meaning hill and 'whang' the name, or sound of a whip, possibly, the name is derived from the cliffs above the original settlement and the sound of wind whistling around their meagre shelters.\n\nThe Covenanters were imprisoned in [[Dunnottar Castle]], where many died. A memorial to them can be found in [[Dunnottar Parish Church|Dunnottar Church]]. Other castles in the vicinity are [[Fetteresso Castle]] and [[Muchalls Castle]], both of which are in private ownership and not open to the public. The oldest surviving structure in Stonehaven is the [[Stonehaven Tolbooth]] at the harbour, used as an early prison and now a museum.  \n\nDunnottar Castle, perched atop a rocky outcrop, was home to the Keith family, and during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]], the [[Honours of Scotland|Scottish Crown Jewels]] were hidden there. In 1296, King [[Edward I of England]] took the [[castle]] only for [[William Wallace]] to reclaim it in 1297, burning down the [[Church (building)|church]] in the process with the entire English garrison still in it. In 1650, [[Oliver Cromwell]] sacked the castle to find the Crown Jewels following an eight-month siege (having previously destroyed the English Crown Jewels). However, just before the castle fell, the Crown Jewels were smuggled out by some ladies who took them by boat to a small church just down the coast in the village of [[Kinneff]], where they remained undetected for eleven years.\n\nStonehaven was a [[Jacobite]] town in the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Fifteen]] and it was a safe base for the retreating Jacobite army to stay overnight on the night of 5\u20136 February 1716. In the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Forty-Five]] Stonehaven, part of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalian]] north-east, was again \u2018reliably Jacobite\u2019 and it was one of the north-eastern ports where reinforcements, plus money and equipment were periodically landed from France.<ref>C.

With 'Kil' meaning hill and 'whang' the name, or sound of a whip, possibly, the name is derived from the cliffs above the original settlement and the sound of wind whistling around their meagre shelters.\n\nThe Covenanters were imprisoned in [[Dunnottar Castle]], where many died. A memorial to them can be found in [[Dunnottar Parish Church|Dunnottar Church]]. Other castles in the vicinity are [[Fetteresso Castle]] and [[Muchalls Castle]], both of which are in private ownership and not open to the public. The oldest surviving structure in Stonehaven is the [[Stonehaven Tolbooth]] at the [[harbour]], used as an early [[prison]] and now a [[museum]].\n\n[[Dunnottar Castle]], perched atop a rocky [[outcrop]], was home to the Keith family, and during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]], the [[Honours of Scotland|Scottish Crown Jewels]] were hidden there. In 1296, King [[Edward I of England]] took the [[castle]] only for [[William Wallace]] to reclaim it in 1297, burning down the [[Church (building)|church]] in the process with the entire English garrison still in it. In 1650, [[Oliver Cromwell]] sacked the castle to find the Crown Jewels following an eight-month siege (having previously destroyed the English Crown Jewels). However, just before the castle fell, the Crown Jewels were smuggled out by some ladies who took them by boat to a small church just down the coast in the village of Kinneff, where they remained undetected for eleven years.\n\nStonehaven was a Jacobite town in the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Fifteen]] and it was a safe base for the retreating Jacobite army to stay overnight on the night of 5\u20136 February 1716. In the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Forty-Five]] Stonehaven, part of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalian]] north-east, was again \u2018reliably Jacobite\u2019 and it was one of the north-eastern ports where reinforcements, plus money and equipment were periodically landed from France.<ref>C.

The increasing demand for new, middle class housing has seen four new estates being appended to the town, creating an expanse of [[suburb]]s and Stonehaven has been bypassed since 1984.\n\nBecause of its location at the [[confluence]] between two rivers, Stonehaven is prone to [[flooding]] following heavy rain.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-20827290 |title=Stonehaven's flood-hit homes evacuated |date=23 December 2012 |work=BBC News |accessdate=23 December 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8337149.stm |title=Heavy rain causes flooding chaos |date= 2 November 2009 |work=BBC News |accessdate=23 December 2012 }}</ref> [[Aberdeenshire Council]] has held meetings about the possible construction of [[flood defence]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/committees/files_meta/802572870061668E8025798100513F75/2012_01_17%20Public%20Consultation%20Proposals%20on%20Flood%20Alleviation%20Options%20.pdf |title=Public Consultation Proposals on Flood Alleviation Options - Stonehaven (River Carron) |date=17 Jan 2012 |publisher=Aberdeenshire Council |access-date=23 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221224522/https://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/committees/files_meta/802572870061668E8025798100513F75/2012_01_17%20Public%20Consultation%20Proposals%20on%20Flood%20Alleviation%20Options%20.pdf |archive-date=21 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Educational establishments==\n\n===Primary schools===\n* '''Arduthie School''' is one of the three primary schools in Stonehaven serving a large portion of the north and east of the town as well as the surrounding countryside to the north-west.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/local/map.asp?type=school_area&id=151085052 |title=Catchment map for Arduthie Primary School |date= |publisher=Aberdeenshire Council |access-date=23 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120719212636/http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/local/map.asp?type=school_area&id=151085052 |archive-date=19 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* '''Dunnottar School''' was founded in 1889.

Led by the [[herring]] fishery, the catch peaked around the year 1894 with a peak catch of about 15 million fish per annum and an employment in the fishing industry of 1280 people. Due to [[overfishing]] to serve the [[population|expanding regional population]], the fishing industry declined with diminishing catches, such that by 1939 only a remnant of the earlier fishing fleet continued to exist,<ref name=\"Watt\"/> and the catch mostly supported the local population from that point onward.\n\n[[File:Bar_at_Marine_Hotel,_Stonehaven.jpg|right|thumb|Bar At The Marine Hotel, Stonehaven Harbour|Bar At The Marine Hotel, Stonehaven Harbour]]\nAt present day the town's primary industries are marine services and [[tourism]], with [[Dunnottar Castle]], a local landmark, bringing in a large number of tourists every year. Dunnottar Castle is regularly used in promotional material by the Scottish tourism industry; in addition, it was used in the 1990 film ''[[Hamlet (1990 movie)|Hamlet]]'', and appeared as a featured desktop background in the UK edition of [[Windows 7|Microsoft Windows 7]]. Another attractive feature of the town is the long beach facing the [[North Sea]], with large cliffs at either end sheltering small rock pools and inlets. It is also famous for its [[Stonehaven Open Air Pool|olympic-sized outdoor swimming pool]], which is heated and filled with a mixture of tap water and filtered seawater. The local harbour features the [[Stonehaven Tolbooth|Tolbooth]], the town's small museum of local heritage.\n\n[[File:Stonehave fireballs 2003.jpg|right|thumb|Stonehaven Fireballs Ceremony 2003|Stonehaven Fireballs Ceremony 2003]]\nDuring [[Hogmanay]] festivities, the [[High Street]] comes alive with crowds watching the annual fireballs ceremony, in which volunteers walking down the High Street swing huge balls of fire around and around at the ends of chains.
