{"title_page": "Continuing Anglican movement", "text_new": "{{Anglicanism}}\n\nThe '''Continuing Anglican movement''', also known as the '''Anglican Continuum''', encompasses a number of Christian churches, principally based in North America, with an [[Anglican]] identity and tradition but are not part of the [[Anglican Communion]]. The largest of these are the [[Anglican Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Church in America]], the [[Anglican Province of America]], the [[Anglican Province of Christ the King]], the [[Diocese of the Holy Cross]], the [[Episcopal Missionary Church]], and the [[United Episcopal Church of North America]]. These churches generally believe that traditional forms of Anglican faith and worship have been unacceptably revised or abandoned within some Anglican Communion churches in recent decades and, therefore, that they are \"continuing\" or preserving both Anglican lines of [[apostolic succession]] and historic Anglican belief and practice.\n\n==Relations with the Anglican Communion==\nContinuing Anglican churches were formed by [[clergy]] and [[laity|lay people]] who left churches belonging to the Anglican Communion. The Continuing Anglican churches believe those churches have been compromised by adopting secular cultural standards and liberal approaches to theology.<ref>Morgan, Timothy C. (December 4, 2008).

Many continuing Anglicans believe that they are preserving historic Anglican tradition and Apostolic Christianity and that it is the Episcopal Church in the United States, as well as other parts of the Anglican Communion, which have become heterodox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancatholic.org/affirmstlouis.html|title=Anglican Catholic|author=Plexus Web Creations|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Theological unity and diversity==\nAnglicanism in general has always sought a balance between the emphases of [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]], while tolerating a range of expressions of [[evangelicalism]] and ceremony. Clergy and laity from all Anglican [[churchmanship]] traditions have been active in the formation of the Continuing Anglican movement.\n\nThere are [[high church]], [[broad church]], and [[low church]] Continuing Anglicans. Many are [[Anglo-Catholic]], such as the [[Anglican Catholic Church|ACC]] and the [[Anglican Province of America|APA]] and the [[Anglican Church in America|ACA]]] with highly ceremonial liturgical practices.  Others which belong to a more Evangelical tradition, such as the [[United Episcopal Church of North America|UECNA]], support the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] and often alternate [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]] with [[Holy Communion]].\n\nThe Continuing churches in the United States reject the 1979 revision of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] made by the Episcopal Church and use the 1928 version or other prior official versions of the Book of Common Prayer for their services instead. In addition, some Anglo-Catholic bodies{{which|date=February 2020}} also use the [[Anglican Missal]] or [[English Missal]] in celebrating the Eucharist.\n\nLiturgical use of the 1611 [[Authorized Version]] of the Bible (known in the United States as the [[King James Version]]) is also a common feature. This is done for many reasons, including aesthetics, and in opposition to what the groups regard as the [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] or [[progressive Christianity|progressive]] theology that updated English translations such as the [[New Revised Standard Version]] embody.<ref>Hart, Fr.

We acknowledge that rule of faith laid down by St. Vincent of Lerins: \"Let us hold that which has been believed everywhere, always and by all, for that is truly and properly Catholic.\"<ref name=affirmation/>}}\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThe Continuing Anglican movement originated in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]]. Related churches in other countries, such as the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia and the Church of England (Continuing), were founded later.\n\nIn 1976, the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] voted to approve the ordination of women to the [[priest]]hood and to the [[bishop|episcopate]] and also provisionally adopted a new and doctrinally controversial [[Book of Common Prayer]], later called the 1979 version. During the following year, 1977, several thousand dissenting [[clergy]] and laypersons responded to those actions by meeting in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] under the auspices of the Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicanchurches.net/jurisdictions.html|title=Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen - Directory of Jurisdictions|accessdate=5 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131140728/http://www.anglicanchurches.net/jurisdictions.html|archive-date=31 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and adopted a theological statement, the [[Affirmation of St. Louis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acahome.org/submenu/docs/affirm.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716133729/http://www.acahome.org/submenu/docs/affirm.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Affirmation of St. Louis (1977)|archivedate=July 16, 2006|website=www.acahome.org}}</ref> The Affirmation expressed a determination \"to continue in the Catholic Faith, Apostolic Order, Orthodox Worship and Evangelical Witness of the traditional Anglican Church, doing all things necessary for the continuance of the same.\"\n\nOut of this meeting came a new church with the provisional name of the \"Anglican Church in North America (Episcopal)\".  The first bishop of the new church, [[Charles Doren]], was consecrated by a retired bishop of the Episcopal Church, [[Albert A. Chambers]] of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Springfield|Diocese of Springfield, Illinois]], with Francisco Pagtakhan of the [[Philippine Independent Church]] as co-consecrator. Although expected to be the third bishop participating in Doren's consecration, [[Mark Pae]] of the Anglican Church of Korea sent a letter of consent instead. This development left the new group open to charges of violating the customs of [[apostolic succession]], in which three bishops customarily are present.\n\nThe newly consecrated Doren then joined with Chambers and Pagtakhan in consecrating as bishops [[James Orin Mote]], [[Robert S. Morse]], and Francis Watterson. Watterson left the movement shortly afterward and became a [[Roman Catholic]] priest.\n\n===Early fractures===\nDuring the process of ratifying the new church's constitution, disputes developed which split its dioceses into two American churches and a separate Canadian church. These were the [[Anglican Catholic Church]] led by Mote, the Diocese of Christ the King (now the [[Anglican Province of Christ the King]]) led by Morse, and the [[Anglican Catholic Church of Canada]].

These churches generally believe that traditional forms of Anglican faith and worship have been unacceptably revised or abandoned within some Anglican Communion churches in recent decades and, therefore, that they are \"continuing\" or preserving both Anglican lines of [[apostolic succession]] and historic Anglican belief and practice.\n\n==Relations with the Anglican Communion==\nContinuing Anglican churches were formed by [[clergy]] and [[laity|lay people]] who left churches belonging to the Anglican Communion.

Clergy and laity from all Anglican [[churchmanship]] traditions have been active in the formation of the Continuing Anglican movement.\n\nThere are [[high church]], [[broad church]], and [[low church]] Continuing Anglicans. Many are [[Anglo-Catholic]], such as the [[Anglican Catholic Church|ACC]] and the [[Anglican Province of America|APA]] and the [[Anglican Church in America|ACA]]] with highly ceremonial liturgical practices.  Others which belong to a more Evangelical tradition, such as the [[United Episcopal Church of North America|UECNA]], support the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] and often alternate [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]] with [[Holy Communion]].\n\nThe Continuing churches in the United States reject the 1979 revision of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] made by the Episcopal Church and use the 1928 version or other prior official versions of the Book of Common Prayer for their services instead. In addition, some Anglo-Catholic bodies{{which|date=February 2020}} also use the [[Anglican Missal]] or [[English Missal]] in celebrating the Eucharist.\n\nLiturgical use of the 1611 [[Authorized Version]] of the Bible (known in the United States as the [[King James Version]]) is also a common feature. This is done for many reasons, including aesthetics, and in opposition to what the groups regard as the [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] or [[progressive Christianity|progressive]] theology that updated English translations such as the [[New Revised Standard Version]] embody.<ref>Hart, Fr.

Related churches in other countries, such as the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia and the Church of England (Continuing), were founded later.\n\nIn 1976, the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] voted to approve the ordination of women to the [[priest]]hood and to the [[bishop|episcopate]] and also provisionally adopted a new and doctrinally controversial [[Book of Common Prayer]], later called the 1979 version. During the following year, 1977, several thousand dissenting [[clergy]] and laypersons responded to those actions by meeting in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] under the auspices of the Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicanchurches.net/jurisdictions.html|title=Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen - Directory of Jurisdictions|accessdate=5 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131140728/http://www.anglicanchurches.net/jurisdictions.html|archive-date=31 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and adopted a theological statement, the [[Affirmation of St. Louis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acahome.org/submenu/docs/affirm.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716133729/http://www.acahome.org/submenu/docs/affirm.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Affirmation of St. Louis (1977)|archivedate=July 16, 2006|website=www.acahome.org}}</ref> The Affirmation expressed a determination \"to continue in the Catholic Faith, Apostolic Order, Orthodox Worship and Evangelical Witness of the traditional Anglican Church, doing all things necessary for the continuance of the same.\"\n\nOut of this meeting came a new church with the provisional name of the \"Anglican Church in North America (Episcopal)\".  The first bishop of the new church, [[Charles Doren]], was consecrated by a retired bishop of the Episcopal Church, [[Albert A. Chambers]] of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Springfield|Diocese of Springfield, Illinois]], with Francisco Pagtakhan of the [[Philippine Independent Church]] as co-consecrator. Although expected to be the third bishop participating in Doren's consecration, [[Mark Pae]] of the Anglican Church of Korea sent a letter of consent instead. This development left the new group open to charges of violating the customs of [[apostolic succession]], in which three bishops customarily are present.\n\nThe newly consecrated Doren then joined with Chambers and Pagtakhan in consecrating as bishops [[James Orin Mote]], [[Robert S. Morse]], and Francis Watterson. Watterson left the movement shortly afterward and became a [[Roman Catholic]] priest.\n\n===Early fractures===\nDuring the process of ratifying the new church's constitution, disputes developed which split its dioceses into two American churches and a separate Canadian church. These were the [[Anglican Catholic Church]] led by Mote, the Diocese of Christ the King (now the [[Anglican Province of Christ the King]]) led by Morse, and the [[Anglican Catholic Church of Canada]]. In 1981, Doren and others left the Anglican Catholic Church to found the [[United Episcopal Church of North America]] in opposition to the alleged inhospitality of the other jurisdictions towards [[low church]]men.\n\n===Recent developments and statistics===\nThe original generation of Continuing Anglican parishes in North America were located mainly in metropolitan areas.

Originally planning to spend 50 episodes on each film, producer Ben Hosley convinced the hosts to only do ten. Having used a lengthy analysis of a filmography as a means of interrogating the director himself, Newman and Sims decided to use a similar approach in reviewing the works of other directors.<ref name=\"decider\" />\n\nOn January 1, 2019, Newman and Sims created a [[Patreon]] page where fans could pay a monthly amount in exchange for extra content. {{As of|March 2020}}, The ''Blank Check'' Patreon was ranked 16th in the podcast category based on the number of paying supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://graphtreon.com/creator/blankcheck |access-date=March 19, 2020 |website=Graphtreon |title=Blank Check with Griffin & David}}</ref>\n\n==Series overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Miniseries\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Director\n! colspan=\"3\"| Initial Release\n|-\n!

Originally planning to spend 50 episodes on each film, producer Ben Hosley convinced the hosts to only do ten. Having used a lengthy analysis of a filmography as a means of interrogating the director himself, Newman and Sims decided to use a similar approach in reviewing the works of other directors.<ref name=\"decider\" />\n\nOn January 1, 2019, Newman and Sims created a [[Patreon]] page where fans could pay a monthly amount in exchange for extra content. {{As of|March 2020}}, The ''Blank Check'' Patreon was ranked 16th in the podcast category based on the number of paying supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://graphtreon.com/creator/blankcheck |access-date=March 19, 2020 |website=Graphtreon |title=Blank Check with Griffin & David}}</ref>\n\n==Series overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Miniseries\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Director\n! colspan=\"3\"| Initial Release\n|-\n!

Both can occur if gallstones leave the gallbladder, pass through the [[cystic duct]], and get stuck in the [[common bile duct]]. The common bile duct drains the liver and pancreas, and a blockage there can lead to inflammation and infection in both the pancreas and biliary system. While cholecystectomy is not usually the immediate treatment choice for either of these conditions, it is often recommended to prevent repeat episodes from additional gallstones getting stuck.<ref name=\"Goldman2011\" />{{rp|940,1017}}\n\n===Gallbladder cancer===\n[[Gallbladder cancer]] (also called carcinoma of the gallbladder) is a rare indication for cholecystectomy. In cases where cancer is suspected, the open technique for cholecystectomy is usually performed.<ref name=EssentialSurg2015/>\n\n===Liver transplantation===\nIn [[living donor liver transplantation]] between adults, a cholecystectomy is performed in the donor because gallbladder interferes with removal of the right (lateral) lobe of the liver and to prevent the formation of gallstones in the recipient.<ref>[https://www.nebraskamed.com/transplant/liver/after-operation What to expect after your liver transplant]</ref><ref>[https://www.umms.org/ummc/health-services/transplant/organ/liver/living-donor Living Donor Liver Transplant]</ref> The gallbladder is not removed in [[pediatric]] transplantations as the left lobe of the liver is used instead.<ref>[https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/education/liver_donor_the_donation_surgery/ Liver Donors FAQ: The Donation Surgery]</ref>\n\n==Contraindications==\nThere are no specific contraindications for cholecystectomy, and in general it is considered a low-risk surgery. However, anyone who cannot tolerate surgery under general anesthesia should not undergo cholecystectomy. People can be split into high and low risk groups using a tool such as the [[ASA physical status classification system|ASA physical status]] classification system.

ERCP is often used to retrieve stones stuck in the common bile duct in patients with gallstone pancreatitis or cholangitis. In this procedure, an endoscope, or small, long thin tube with a camera on the end, is passed through the mouth and down the throat. The doctor advances the camera through the stomach and into the first part of the small intestine to reach the opening of the bile duct. The doctor can inject a special, radiopaque dye through the endoscope into the bile duct to see stones or other blockages on x-ray.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007479.htm|title=ERCP: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>  ERCP does not require general anaesthesia and can be done outside of the operating room.

ERCP is often used to retrieve stones stuck in the common bile duct in patients with gallstone pancreatitis or cholangitis. In this procedure, an endoscope, or small, long thin tube with a camera on the end, is passed through the mouth and down the throat. The doctor advances the camera through the stomach and into the first part of the small intestine to reach the opening of the bile duct. The doctor can inject a special, radiopaque dye through the endoscope into the bile duct to see stones or other blockages on x-ray.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007479.htm|title=ERCP: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>  ERCP does not require general anaesthesia and can be done outside of the operating room. While ERCP can be used to remove a specific stone that is causing a blockage to allow drainage, it cannot remove all stones in the gallbladder.

Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from [[coal]] stocks, coal handling facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid rock drainage. This liquid often contains toxic metals, such as copper or iron. These, combined with reduced pH, have a detrimental impact on the streams aquatic environments.\n\nThe same type of chemical reactions and processes may occur through the disturbance of [[acid sulfate soil]]s formed under coastal or estuarine conditions after the last major sea level rise, and constitutes a similar [[environmental hazard]].\n\n==Nomenclature==\nHistorically, the acidic discharges from active or abandoned mines were called acid mine drainage, or AMD. The term acid rock drainage, or ARD, was introduced in the 1980s and 1990s to indicate that acidic drainage can originate from sources other than mines.<ref>Dowding, B. & Mills, C,: ''[http://technology.infomine.com/enviromine/ard/Introduction/Natural.htm Natural acid rock drainage and its impact upon background metal concentrations]'', [http://www.infomine.com/ InfoMine.com]. Accessed 23 September 2013.</ref> For example, a paper presented in 1991 at a major international conference on this subject was titled: \"The Prediction of Acid Rock Drainage - Lessons from the Database\"<ref>Ferguson, K.D. and Morin, K.A. The Prediction of Acid Rock Drainage - Lessons from the Database. ''Proceedings: Second International Conference on the Abatement of Acidic Drainage.'' Sept 16 to 18, 1991, Montreal, Quebec.</ref> Both AMD and ARD refer to low [[pH]] or acidic waters caused by the oxidation of [[sulfide minerals]], though ARD is the more generic name.\n\nIn cases where drainage from a mine is not acidic and has dissolved metals or [[metalloid]]s, or was originally acidic, but has been neutralized along its flow path, then it is described as \"neutral mine drainage\",<ref name=\"GARD\">[http://www.gardguide.com/index.php/Main_Page Global Acid Rock Drainage Guide (GARD Guide)] INAP: The International Network for Acid Prevention. Accessed 23 September 2013.</ref> \"mining-influenced water\"<ref>Gusek, J.J., Wildeman, T.R. and Conroy, K.W. 2006. Conceptual methods for recovering metal resources from passive treatment systems. ''Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Acid Rock Drainage (ICARD)'', March 26\u201330, 2006, St. Louis MO.</ref> or otherwise. None of these other names have gained general acceptance.\n\n==Occurrence==\n[[File:GoldinPyriteDrainage acide.JPG|thumb|In this case, the pyrite has dissolved away yielding a cube shape and residual gold. This break down is the main driver of acid mine drainage.]]\n[[Sub-surface mining]] often progresses below the [[water table]], so water must be constantly pumped out of the mine in order to prevent flooding. When a mine is abandoned, the pumping ceases, and water floods the mine. This introduction of water is the initial step in most acid rock drainage situations. [[Tailings]] piles or ponds, [[mine waste rock dumps]],<ref name=\"GARD\" /> and [[Spoil tip|coal spoils]] are also an important source of acid mine drainage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martinez|first=Raul E.|last2=Ho\u00e0ng|first2=Thi B\u00edch H\u00f2a|last3=Weber|first3=Sebastian|last4=Faucon|first4=Michel-Pierre|last5=Pourret|first5=Olivier|last6=Marquez|first6=J.

Colonies of [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[archaea]] greatly accelerate the decomposition of metal ions, although the reactions also occur in an abiotic environment.

Acidic water produced at active mines must be neutralized to achieve pH 6-9 before discharge from a mine site to a stream is permitted.\n\nIn Canada, work to reduce the effects of acid mine drainage is concentrated under the Mine Environment Neutral Drainage (MEND) program.

In this application, a slurry of lime is dispersed into a tank containing acid mine drainage and recycled sludge to increase water pH to about 9. At this pH, most toxic metals become insoluble and precipitate, aided by the presence of recycled sludge. Optionally, air may be introduced in this tank to oxidize iron and manganese and assist in their precipitation. The resulting slurry is directed to a sludge-settling vessel, such as a [[clarifier]]. In that vessel, clean water will overflow for release, whereas settled metal precipitates (sludge) will be recycled to the acid mine drainage treatment tank, with a sludge-wasting side stream. A number of variations of this process exist, as dictated by the chemistry of ARD, its volume, and other factors.<ref>Zinck, J.M. and Griffith, W.F. 2000. An assessment of HDS-type lime treatment processes \u2013 efficiency and environmental impact. In: ICARD 2000. Proceedings from the Fifth International Conference on Acid Rock Drainage. Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration, Inc. Vol II, 1027-1034</ref> Generally, the products of the HDS process also contain [[gypsum]] ([[Calcium sulfate|CaSO<sub>4</sub>]]) and unreacted lime, which enhance both its settleability and resistance to re-acidification and metal mobilization. A general equation for this process is:\n\n:H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + [[Calcium oxide|CaO]] -> [[Calcium sulfate|CaSO<sub>4</sub>]] + H<sub>2</sub>O\nor more precisely in [[aqueous solution]]:\n:SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2H<sup>+</sup>  +  [[Calcium oxide|Ca<sup>2+</sup>+O<sup>2&minus;</sup>]]<small>(aq)</small> -> Ca<sup>2+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup><small>(aq)</small> + 2H<sup>+</sup> + O<sup>2&minus;</sup> <small>(aq)</small>\n\nLess complex variants of this process, such as simple lime neutralization, may involve no more than a lime silo, mixing tank and settling pond. These systems are far less costly to build, but are also less efficient (i.e., longer reaction times are required, and they produce a discharge with higher trace metal concentrations, if present). They would be suitable for relatively small flows or less complex acid mine drainage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/chemtrt.htm|title=Overview of Acid Mine Drainage Treatment with Chemicals|access-date=13 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524070234/http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/chemtrt.htm|archive-date=24 May 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Calcium silicate neutralization====\nA calcium silicate feedstock, made from processed steel slag, can also be used to neutralize active acidity in AMD systems by removing free hydrogen ions from the bulk solution, thereby increasing pH. As the silicate anion captures H<sup>+</sup> ions (raising the pH), it forms monosilicic acid (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), a neutral solute. Monosilicic acid remains in the bulk solution to play many roles in correcting the adverse effects of acidic conditions. In the bulk solution, the silicate anion is very active in neutralizing H<sup>+</sup> cations in the soil solution.<ref name=\"steel slag\">{{cite web|last=Ziemkiewicz |first=Paul |title=The Use of Steel Slag in Acid Mine Drainage Treatment and Control |url=http://wvmdtaskforce.com/proceedings/98/98zie/98zie.htm |accessdate=25 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720064631/http://wvmdtaskforce.com/proceedings/98/98zie/98zie.htm |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref> While its mode-of-action is quite different from limestone, the ability of calcium silicate to neutralize acid solutions is equivalent to limestone as evidenced by its CCE value of 90-100% and its relative neutralizing value of 98%.<ref>''Calcium Silicon-Based Mineral CSA.'' Harsco Minerals.</ref>\n\nIn the presence of heavy metals, calcium silicate reacts in a different manner than limestone. As limestone raises the pH of the bulk solution, and if heavy metals are present, precipitation of the metal hydroxides (with extremely low solubilities) is normally accelerated and the potential of armoring of limestone particles increases significantly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hammarstrom|first=Jane M.|author2=Philip L.

These negatively charged colloids create an electrostatic repulsion with each other (as well as with the negatively charged calcium silicate granules) and the sequestered metal colloids are stabilized and remain in a dispersed state - effectively interrupting metal precipitation and reducing vulnerability of the material to armoring.<ref name=\"steel slag\"/>\n\n====Carbonate neutralization====\nGenerally, [[limestone]] or other [[Calcium|calcareous]] [[Stratum|strata]] that could neutralize acid are lacking or deficient at sites that produce acidic rock drainage. Limestone chips may be introduced into sites to create a neutralizing effect. Where limestone has been used, such as at [[Cwm Rheidol]] in mid [[Wales]], the positive impact has been much less than anticipated because of the creation of an insoluble [[calcium sulfate]] layer on the limestone chips, binding the material and preventing further neutralization.\n\n====Ion exchange====\n[[Ion exchange|Cation exchange]] processes have previously been investigated as a potential treatment for acid mine drainage. The principle is that an ion exchange resin can remove potentially toxic metals (cationic resins), or chlorides, sulfates and uranyl sulfate complexes (anionic resins) from [[mine water]].<ref>M. Botha, L. Bester, E. Hardwick \"Removal of Uranium from Mine Water Using Ion Exchange at Driefontein Mine\"</ref> Once the contaminants are adsorbed, the exchange sites on resins must be regenerated, which typically requires acidic and basic reagents and generates a brine that contains the pollutants in a concentrated form. A South African company that won the 2013 IChemE (ww.icheme.org) award for water management and supply (treating AMD) have developed a patented ion-exchange process that treats mine effluents (and AMD) economically.\n\n====Constructed wetlands====\n[[Constructed wetland]]s systems have been proposed during the 1980s to treat acid mine drainage generated by the abandoned coal mines in Eastern Appalachia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://technology.infomine.com/enviromine/wetlands/coal.htm |title=Constructed wetlands for treatment of mine drainage - Coal-generated AMD |author= Andr\u00e9 Sobolewski |publisher=Wetlands for the Treatment of Mine Drainage |accessdate=2010-12-12 }}</ref>  Generally, the wetlands receive near-neutral water, after it has been neutralized by (typically) a limestone-based treatment process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/passtrt/passtrt.htm|title=Overview of Passive Systems for Treating Acid Mine Drainage|access-date=13 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906074838/http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/passtrt/passtrt.htm|archive-date=6 September 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Metal precipitation occurs from their oxidation at near-neutral pH, complexation with organic matter, precipitation as carbonates or sulfides. The latter results from sediment-borne anaerobic bacteria capable of reverting sulfate ions into sulfide ions. These sulfide ions can then bind with heavy metal ions, precipitating heavy metals out of solution and effectively reversing the entire process.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe attractiveness of a constructed wetlands solution lies in its relative low cost. They are limited by the metal loads they can deal with (either from high flows or metal concentrations), though current practitioners have succeeded in developing constructed wetlands that treat high volumes (see description of Campbell Mine [[constructed wetland]]) and/or highly acidic water (with adequate pre-treatment). Typically, the effluent from constructed wetland receiving near-neutral water will be well-buffered at between 6.5-7.0 and can readily be discharged. Some of metal precipitates retained in sediments are unstable when exposed to oxygen (e.g., copper sulfide or elemental selenium), and it is very important that the wetland sediments remain largely or permanently submerged.\n\nAn example of an effective constructed wetland is on the [[Afon Pelena]] in the [[River Afan]] valley above [[Port Talbot]] where highly ferruginous discharges from the [[Whitworth mine]] have been successfully treated.\n\n====Precipitation of metal sulfides====\nMost base metals in acidic solution precipitate in contact with free sulfide, e.g. from H<sub>2</sub>S or NaHS. Solid-liquid separation after reaction would produce a base metal-free effluent that can be discharged or further treated to reduce sulfate, and a metal sulfide concentrate with possible economic value.\n\nAs an alternative, several researchers have investigated the precipitation of metals using biogenic sulfide. In this process, [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria]] oxidize organic matter using sulfate, instead of oxygen. Their metabolic products include [[bicarbonate]], which can neutralize water acidity, and [[hydrogen sulfide]], which forms highly insoluble precipitates with many toxic metals. Although promising, this process has been slow in being adopted for a variety of technical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Operational Lessons Learned During Bioreactor Demonstrations for Acid Rock Drainage Treatment|first1=Diana|last1=Bless|first2=Brian|last2=Park|first3=Suzzann|last3=Nordwick|first4=Marek|last4=Zaluski|first5=Helen|last5=Joyce|first6=Randy|last6=Hiebert|first7=Charles|last7=Clavelot|date=1 December 2008|journal=Mine Water and the Environment|volume=27|issue=4|pages=241\u2013250|doi=10.1007/s10230-008-0052-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Technologies ===\nMany technologies exist for the treatment of AMD from traditional high cost water treatment plants to simple [[in situ water treatment]] reagent dosing methods.\n\n== Metagenomic study ==\n\nWith the advance of [[DNA sequencing#New sequencing methods|large-scale sequencing strategies]], [[genome]]s of microorganisms in the acid mine drainage community are directly sequenced from the environment.

Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from [[coal]] stocks, coal handling facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid rock drainage. This liquid often contains toxic metals, such as copper or iron. These, combined with reduced pH, have a detrimental impact on the streams aquatic environments.\n\nThe same type of chemical reactions and processes may occur through the disturbance of [[acid sulfate soil]]s formed under coastal or estuarine conditions after the last major sea level rise, and constitutes a similar [[environmental hazard]].\n\n==Nomenclature==\nHistorically, the acidic discharges from active or abandoned mines were called acid mine drainage, or AMD. The term acid rock drainage, or ARD, was introduced in the 1980s and 1990s to indicate that acidic drainage can originate from sources other than mines.<ref>Dowding, B. & Mills, C,: ''[http://technology.infomine.com/enviromine/ard/Introduction/Natural.htm Natural acid rock drainage and its impact upon background metal concentrations]'', [http://www.infomine.com/ InfoMine.com]. Accessed 23 September 2013.</ref> For example, a paper presented in 1991 at a major international conference on this subject was titled: \"The Prediction of Acid Rock Drainage - Lessons from the Database\"<ref>Ferguson, K.D. and Morin, K.A. The Prediction of Acid Rock Drainage - Lessons from the Database. ''Proceedings: Second International Conference on the Abatement of Acidic Drainage.'' Sept 16 to 18, 1991, Montreal, Quebec.</ref> Both AMD and ARD refer to low [[pH]] or acidic waters caused by the oxidation of [[sulfide minerals]], though ARD is the more generic name.\n\nIn cases where drainage from a mine is not acidic and has dissolved metals or [[metalloid]]s, or was originally acidic, but has been neutralized along its flow path, then it is described as \"neutral mine drainage\",<ref name=\"GARD\">[http://www.gardguide.com/index.php/Main_Page Global Acid Rock Drainage Guide (GARD Guide)] INAP: The International Network for Acid Prevention.

None of these other names have gained general acceptance.\n\n==Occurrence==\n[[File:GoldinPyriteDrainage acide.JPG|thumb|In this case, the pyrite has dissolved away yielding a cube shape and residual gold. This break down is the main driver of acid mine drainage.]]\n[[Sub-surface mining]] often progresses below the [[water table]], so water must be constantly pumped out of the mine in order to prevent flooding. When a mine is abandoned, the pumping ceases, and water floods the mine. This introduction of water is the initial step in most acid rock drainage situations. [[Tailings]] piles or ponds, [[mine waste rock dumps]],<ref name=\"GARD\" /> and [[Spoil tip|coal spoils]] are also an important source of acid mine drainage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martinez|first=Raul E.|last2=Ho\u00e0ng|first2=Thi B\u00edch H\u00f2a|last3=Weber|first3=Sebastian|last4=Faucon|first4=Michel-Pierre|last5=Pourret|first5=Olivier|last6=Marquez|first6=J.

Colonies of [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[archaea]] greatly accelerate the decomposition of metal ions, although the reactions also occur in an abiotic environment. These microbes, called [[extremophile]]s for their ability to survive in harsh conditions, occur naturally in the rock, but limited water and [[oxygen]] supplies usually keep their numbers low. Special extremophiles known as [[Acidophile]]s especially favor the low [[pH]] levels of abandoned mines.

The ferric cations produced can also oxidize additional pyrite and reduce into ferrous ions:\n\n:<chem>FeS2{\\scriptstyle (s)} + 14Fe^{3+}{\\scriptstyle (aq)} + 8H2O{\\scriptstyle (l)} -> 15Fe^{2+}{\\scriptstyle (aq)} + 2SO4^{2-}{\\scriptstyle (aq)} + 16H+{\\scriptstyle (aq)}</chem>.\nThe net effect of these reactions is to release H<sup>+</sup>, which lowers the pH and maintains the solubility of the ferric ion.\n\n==Effects==\n\n===Effects on pH===\n[[File:Rio tinto river CarolStoker NASA Ames Research Center.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in Spain.]]\nWater temperatures as high as 47&nbsp;\u00b0C<ref>Nordstrom, D.K. & Alpers, C.

Total liability from acid rock drainage is estimated to be between $2 billion and $5 billion CAD.<ref>[http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mms/canmet-mtb/mmsl-lmsm/enviro/effluents/effspecserv-e.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423224403/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mms/canmet-mtb/mmsl-lmsm/enviro/effluents/effspecserv-e.htm|date=23 April 2008}}</ref>  Over a period of eight years, MEND claims to have reduced ARD liability by up to $400 million CAD, from an investment of $17.5 million CAD.<ref>[http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mms/canmet-mtb/mmsl-lmsm/mend/default_e.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604053644/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mms/canmet-mtb/mmsl-lmsm/mend/default_e.htm|date=4 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Methods===\n\n====Lime neutralization====\nBy far, the most commonly used commercial process for treating acid mine drainage is [[Lime (material)|lime]] ([[Calcium oxide|CaO]]) precipitation in a high-density sludge (HDS) process. In this application, a slurry of lime is dispersed into a tank containing acid mine drainage and recycled sludge to increase water pH to about 9. At this pH, most toxic metals become insoluble and precipitate, aided by the presence of recycled sludge. Optionally, air may be introduced in this tank to oxidize iron and manganese and assist in their precipitation. The resulting slurry is directed to a sludge-settling vessel, such as a [[clarifier]]. In that vessel, clean water will overflow for release, whereas settled metal precipitates (sludge) will be recycled to the acid mine drainage treatment tank, with a sludge-wasting side stream. A number of variations of this process exist, as dictated by the chemistry of ARD, its volume, and other factors.<ref>Zinck, J.M. and Griffith, W.F. 2000. An assessment of HDS-type lime treatment processes \u2013 efficiency and environmental impact. In: ICARD 2000. Proceedings from the Fifth International Conference on Acid Rock Drainage. Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration, Inc. Vol II, 1027-1034</ref> Generally, the products of the HDS process also contain [[gypsum]] ([[Calcium sulfate|CaSO<sub>4</sub>]]) and unreacted lime, which enhance both its settleability and resistance to re-acidification and metal mobilization. A general equation for this process is:\n\n:H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + [[Calcium oxide|CaO]] -> [[Calcium sulfate|CaSO<sub>4</sub>]] + H<sub>2</sub>O\nor more precisely in [[aqueous solution]]:\n:SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2H<sup>+</sup>  +  [[Calcium oxide|Ca<sup>2+</sup>+O<sup>2&minus;</sup>]]<small>(aq)</small> -> Ca<sup>2+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup><small>(aq)</small> + 2H<sup>+</sup> + O<sup>2&minus;</sup> <small>(aq)</small>\n\nLess complex variants of this process, such as simple lime neutralization, may involve no more than a lime silo, mixing tank and settling pond. These systems are far less costly to build, but are also less efficient (i.e., longer reaction times are required, and they produce a discharge with higher trace metal concentrations, if present). They would be suitable for relatively small flows or less complex acid mine drainage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/chemtrt.htm|title=Overview of Acid Mine Drainage Treatment with Chemicals|access-date=13 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524070234/http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/chemtrt.htm|archive-date=24 May 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Calcium silicate neutralization====\nA calcium silicate feedstock, made from processed steel slag, can also be used to neutralize active acidity in AMD systems by removing free hydrogen ions from the bulk solution, thereby increasing pH. As the silicate anion captures H<sup>+</sup> ions (raising the pH), it forms monosilicic acid (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), a neutral solute. Monosilicic acid remains in the bulk solution to play many roles in correcting the adverse effects of acidic conditions. In the bulk solution, the silicate anion is very active in neutralizing H<sup>+</sup> cations in the soil solution.<ref name=\"steel slag\">{{cite web|last=Ziemkiewicz |first=Paul |title=The Use of Steel Slag in Acid Mine Drainage Treatment and Control |url=http://wvmdtaskforce.com/proceedings/98/98zie/98zie.htm |accessdate=25 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720064631/http://wvmdtaskforce.com/proceedings/98/98zie/98zie.htm |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref> While its mode-of-action is quite different from limestone, the ability of calcium silicate to neutralize acid solutions is equivalent to limestone as evidenced by its CCE value of 90-100% and its relative neutralizing value of 98%.<ref>''Calcium Silicon-Based Mineral CSA.'' Harsco Minerals.</ref>\n\nIn the presence of heavy metals, calcium silicate reacts in a different manner than limestone. As limestone raises the pH of the bulk solution, and if heavy metals are present, precipitation of the metal hydroxides (with extremely low solubilities) is normally accelerated and the potential of armoring of limestone particles increases significantly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hammarstrom|first=Jane M.|author2=Philip L. Sibrell|author3= Harvey E. Belkin|title=Characterization of limestone reacted with acid-mine drainage|journal=Applied Geochemistry|issue=18|pages=1710\u20131714|url=http://mine-drainage.usgs.gov/pubs/AG_18-1705-1721.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref> In the calcium silicate [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]], as silicic acid species are absorbed onto the metal surface, the development of silica layers (mono- and bi-layers) lead to the formation of colloidal complexes with neutral or negative surface charges. These negatively charged colloids create an electrostatic repulsion with each other (as well as with the negatively charged calcium silicate granules) and the sequestered metal colloids are stabilized and remain in a dispersed state - effectively interrupting metal precipitation and reducing vulnerability of the material to armoring.<ref name=\"steel slag\"/>\n\n====Carbonate neutralization====\nGenerally, [[limestone]] or other [[Calcium|calcareous]] [[Stratum|strata]] that could neutralize acid are lacking or deficient at sites that produce acidic rock drainage. Limestone chips may be introduced into sites to create a neutralizing effect. Where limestone has been used, such as at [[Cwm Rheidol]] in mid [[Wales]], the positive impact has been much less than anticipated because of the creation of an insoluble [[calcium sulfate]] layer on the limestone chips, binding the material and preventing further neutralization.\n\n====Ion exchange====\n[[Ion exchange|Cation exchange]] processes have previously been investigated as a potential treatment for acid mine drainage. The principle is that an ion exchange resin can remove potentially toxic metals (cationic resins), or chlorides, sulfates and uranyl sulfate complexes (anionic resins) from [[mine water]].<ref>M. Botha, L. Bester, E. Hardwick \"Removal of Uranium from Mine Water Using Ion Exchange at Driefontein Mine\"</ref> Once the contaminants are adsorbed, the exchange sites on resins must be regenerated, which typically requires acidic and basic reagents and generates a brine that contains the pollutants in a concentrated form. A South African company that won the 2013 IChemE (ww.icheme.org) award for water management and supply (treating AMD) have developed a patented ion-exchange process that treats mine effluents (and AMD) economically.\n\n====Constructed wetlands====\n[[Constructed wetland]]s systems have been proposed during the 1980s to treat acid mine drainage generated by the abandoned coal mines in Eastern Appalachia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://technology.infomine.com/enviromine/wetlands/coal.htm |title=Constructed wetlands for treatment of mine drainage - Coal-generated AMD |author= Andr\u00e9 Sobolewski |publisher=Wetlands for the Treatment of Mine Drainage |accessdate=2010-12-12 }}</ref>  Generally, the wetlands receive near-neutral water, after it has been neutralized by (typically) a limestone-based treatment process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/passtrt/passtrt.htm|title=Overview of Passive Systems for Treating Acid Mine Drainage|access-date=13 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906074838/http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/landrec/passtrt/passtrt.htm|archive-date=6 September 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Metal precipitation occurs from their oxidation at near-neutral pH, complexation with organic matter, precipitation as carbonates or sulfides. The latter results from sediment-borne anaerobic bacteria capable of reverting sulfate ions into sulfide ions. These sulfide ions can then bind with heavy metal ions, precipitating heavy metals out of solution and effectively reversing the entire process.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe attractiveness of a constructed wetlands solution lies in its relative low cost. They are limited by the metal loads they can deal with (either from high flows or metal concentrations), though current practitioners have succeeded in developing constructed wetlands that treat high volumes (see description of Campbell Mine [[constructed wetland]]) and/or highly acidic water (with adequate pre-treatment). Typically, the effluent from constructed wetland receiving near-neutral water will be well-buffered at between 6.5-7.0 and can readily be discharged. Some of metal precipitates retained in sediments are unstable when exposed to oxygen (e.g., copper sulfide or elemental selenium), and it is very important that the wetland sediments remain largely or permanently submerged.\n\nAn example of an effective constructed wetland is on the [[Afon Pelena]] in the [[River Afan]] valley above [[Port Talbot]] where highly ferruginous discharges from the [[Whitworth mine]] have been successfully treated.\n\n====Precipitation of metal sulfides====\nMost base metals in acidic solution precipitate in contact with free sulfide, e.g. from H<sub>2</sub>S or NaHS. Solid-liquid separation after reaction would produce a base metal-free effluent that can be discharged or further treated to reduce sulfate, and a metal sulfide concentrate with possible economic value.\n\nAs an alternative, several researchers have investigated the precipitation of metals using biogenic sulfide. In this process, [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria]] oxidize organic matter using sulfate, instead of oxygen. Their metabolic products include [[bicarbonate]], which can neutralize water acidity, and [[hydrogen sulfide]], which forms highly insoluble precipitates with many toxic metals. Although promising, this process has been slow in being adopted for a variety of technical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Operational Lessons Learned During Bioreactor Demonstrations for Acid Rock Drainage Treatment|first1=Diana|last1=Bless|first2=Brian|last2=Park|first3=Suzzann|last3=Nordwick|first4=Marek|last4=Zaluski|first5=Helen|last5=Joyce|first6=Randy|last6=Hiebert|first7=Charles|last7=Clavelot|date=1 December 2008|journal=Mine Water and the Environment|volume=27|issue=4|pages=241\u2013250|doi=10.1007/s10230-008-0052-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Technologies ===\nMany technologies exist for the treatment of AMD from traditional high cost water treatment plants to simple [[in situ water treatment]] reagent dosing methods.\n\n== Metagenomic study ==\n\nWith the advance of [[DNA sequencing#New sequencing methods|large-scale sequencing strategies]], [[genome]]s of microorganisms in the acid mine drainage community are directly sequenced from the environment.

{"title_page": "History of the United States Coast Guard", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=October 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\nThe '''history of the [[United States Coast Guard]]''' goes back to the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], which was founded on 4 August 1790 as part of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]].  The Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] were merged to become the Coast Guard per {{USC|14|1}} which states: \"The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.\"  In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was merged into the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard itself was moved to the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. However, under {{USC|14|3}} as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when [[United States Congress|Congress]] so directs in the declaration, or when the [[President of the United States|President]] directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\n==Early history==\n===The Revenue-Marine===\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Lifesaving Service]], but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to authorize a [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|\"system of cutters\"]] to enforce tariffs, which was major source of revenue for the new nation. On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 40 revenue officers. Each cutter was assigned one master and three mates who were commissioned officers. In addition, each cutter was allowed four mariners and two boys. <ref name=Evans5>Evans, p.5</ref> The cutters were collectively referred to as the \"Revenue-Marine,\" and later officially organized as the \"Revenue Cutter Service.\" Initially, the  was not an organized service. Each revenue cutter operated independently, with each assigned to patrol a section of the east coast and reporting directly to the [[Customs House]] in a major port. From 1790, when the [[Continental Navy]] was disbanded, to 1798, when the [[United States Navy]] was created, these \"revenue cutters\" were the country's only naval force.<ref name=Evans14>Evans, p. 14</ref> As such, the cutters and their crews took on a wide variety of duties beyond the enforcement of tariffs, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail. In 1794, the Revenue-Marine was given the mission of preventing trading in slaves from Africa to the United States. Between 1794 and 1865, the Service captured approximately 500 slave ships. In 1808, the Service was responsible for enforcing President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s embargo closing U.S. ports to European trade. The 1822 Timber Act tasked the Revenue Cutter Service with protecting government timber from poachers (this is viewed as the beginning of the Coast Guard's environmental protection mission).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720081519/http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |archive-date=20 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During times of war or crisis, the revenue cutters and their crews were put at the disposal of the Navy. The Revenue-Marine involved in the [[Quasi-War]] with France from 1798 to 1799, the [[War of 1812]], and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\n===United States Revenue Cutter Service===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service.png|thumb|Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service]] \nDuring the [[American Civil War]], USRC ''[[USS Harriet Lane (1857)|Harriet Lane]]'' fired the first naval shots of the war, engaging the steamer ''Nashville'' during the siege of [[Fort Sumter]].<ref name=Evans75>Evans, p. 75</ref> Upon the order of President Lincoln to the Secretary of the Treasury on 14 June 1863, cutters were assigned to the [[North Atlantic Blockading Squadron]]. A [[Confederate Revenue-Marine]] was also formed by crewmen who left the Revenue Cutter Service.\n\nAfter the purchase of Alaska in 1867, {{USRC|Lincoln}}, with First Lieutenant George W. Moore aboard was dispatched to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] to establish United States sovereignty as agent of the U.S. Collector of Customs in San Francisco.

These stations were normally unoccupied \u2013 essentially storehouses for boats and equipment to be used by volunteers. With the signing of the Newell Act on August 14, 1848, Congress appropriated $10,000 to fund lifesaving stations along the east coast. These were loosely administered by the Revenue-Marine, but still dependent on volunteers (like many fire departments of the time).\n\nThis system continued until 1871 when [[Sumner Kimball]] was appointed Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Department. Kimball convinced Congress to appropriate $200,000 to construct new stations, repair old ones, and provide full-time crews. Shortly thereafter, in 1878, the U.S. Lifesaving Service was officially born and so-named.\n\nAlthough the Revenue Cutter Service is perhaps more recognized as ''the'' predecessor of the Coast Guard, the Lifesaving Service's legacy is apparent in many ways, not the least of which is the prominence of the Coast Guard's search and rescue mission in the eyes of the public. The Coast Guard takes its unofficial search and rescue motto, \"You have to go out, but you don't have to come back,\" from the 1899 regulations of the [[United States Life Saving Service]], which stated:\n\n<blockquote>In attempting a rescue the keeper will select either the boat, breeches buoy, or life car, as in his judgment is best suited to effectively cope with the existing conditions. If the device first selected fails after such trial as satisfies him that no further attempt with it is feasible, he will resort to one of the others, and if that fails, then to the remaining one, and he will not desist from his efforts until by actual trial the impossibility of effecting a rescue is demonstrated. The statement of the keeper that he did not try to use the boat because the sea or surf was too heavy will not be accepted unless attempts to launch it were actually made and failed [underlining added], or unless the conformation of the coast\u2014as bluffs, precipitous banks, etc.\u2014is such as to unquestionably preclude the use of a boat.</blockquote>\n\nThese regulations were repeated in the 1934 Coast Guard regulations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nA number of Coast Guard traditions survive from, or pay homage to, the Lifesaving Service as well. For example, members of the Lifesaving Service were referred to as \"surfmen,\" and today the [[Surfman Badge]] it awarded to [[coxswains]] who qualify to operate motor lifeboats in heavy surf conditions. The badge's design is similar to the Lifesaving Service's seal.\n\n===Coast Guard Academy===\nThe School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service was established in 1876, near New Bedford, Massachusetts. It used the [[USRC James C. Dobbin (1853)|USRC ''Dobbin'']] for its training exercises.  It moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and then again in 1910 to Fort Trumbull, near New London, Connecticut. The school provided a two-year premise to ship supplemented by some class work and tutoring in technical subjects.  In 1903, the third year of instruction was added.  The school was oriented to line officers, as engineers were hired directly from civilian life.  In 1906, an engineering program for cadets began. Nevertheless, the school remained small, with 5 to 10 cadets per class. In 1914 the School became the Revenue Cutter Academy and with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service in 1915, it became the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]]. In February 1929, Congress appropriated $1,750,000 for construction of buildings to be used for the academy. The city of New London purchased the land on the Thames River and donated it to the government for use as a Coast Guard facility. Construction began in 1931 and the first cadets began occupying the new facilities in 1932.<ref name=Johnson109>Johnson, p 109</ref>\n\n===Creation of the modern Coast Guard===\nOn 28 January 1915, the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service were merged by act of Congress to form the United States Coast Guard.<ref name=Johnson32>Johnson, p. 32</ref>  The [[United States Lighthouse Service]] which was the oldest government agency, dating from 7 August 1789, was absorbed by the Coast Guard on 1 July 1939.<ref name=Johnson161-162>Johnson, pp. 161\u2013162</ref> On 28 February 1942, the [[Steamboat Inspection Service|Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation]] was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nIn 1920 the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce held hearings on merging the recently created Coast Guard into the United States Navy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdguAAAAMAAJ|title=Transfer of the Coast Guard to the Navy: Hearings Before the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives, Sixty-sixth Congress, Second Session, on H.R. 5516.

All cutters were to report to the nearest Naval District commander and stand by for further orders.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)7>Larzelere (2003), p. 7</ref> All normal operations were suspended with the exception of rescues pending orders from the Navy. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] directed that although the Coast Guard was then a part of the Navy, that most of the administrative details handled by Coast Guard Headquarters would not be changed.  At the outset of the war the Coast Guard consisted of less than 4000 officers and men, had 23 cruising cutters, 21 harbor cutters, 272 rescue stations and 21 cadets at the Coast Guard Academy.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)11-16>Larzelere (2003), pp. 11\u201416</ref><ref name=Larzelere(2003)21>Larzelere (2003), p.21</ref> The Coast Guard was still in a formative stage of development from the merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Lifesaving Service.  Because of this fact, there was not much interaction between the two former entities during the war.  A qualified Lifesaving Service surfman who wished to transfer to a cutter had to be reduced to ordinary seaman upon reporting because of a lack of shipboard skills. Because of this transfers were infrequent.  There were no chief petty officers in the Coast Guard at this time and Coast Guard petty officers assigned to Navy ships often served under less experienced supervisors for less pay.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)19>Larzelere (2003), p. 19</ref>\n\n\nCoast Guard cutters were seen by the Navy as ready assets and were used to fill in for a rapidly expanding Navy.  The Navy recognized Coast Guard officers and petty officers as the experienced mariners that they were and often put them on Navy ships to fill in for crew shortages and lack of experience.\n\n=== Sinking of USCGC Tampa ===\nDuring the late afternoon of 26 September 1918, ''Tampa'' parted company with convoy HG-107, which she had just escorted into the [[Irish Sea]] from Gibraltar. Ordered to put into [[Milford Haven]], [[Wales]], she proceeded independently toward her destination.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)47>Larzelere (2003), p. 47</ref> At 1930 that evening, as she transited the [[Bristol Channel]], the warship was spotted by {{SMU|UB-91||2}}. According to the submarine war diary entry, the U-boat dived and maneuvered into an attack position, firing one torpedo out of the stern tube at 2015 from a range of about 550 meters. Minutes later, the torpedo hit ''Tampa'' and exploded portside amidships, throwing up a huge, luminous column of water.<ref name=Johnson55>Johnson, p 55</ref> The cutter sank with all hands: 111 Coast Guardsmen, 4 U.S. Navy sailors, and 16 passengers consisting of 11 [[Royal Navy]] sailors and 5 [[United States Maritime Service|Maritime Service Merchant Marines]].<ref name=Larzelere(2003)49>Larzelere (2003), p. 49</ref> The sinking of ''Tampa'' was the largest single loss of Coast Guard personnel in the war.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)50>Larzelere (2003), p. 50</ref> She sank in the [[Bristol Channel]] at roughly {{coord|50|40|N|6|19|W}}.<ref name=DANFS>''Tampa'', Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, U.S. Navy Naval History & Heritage Command</ref>\n\n\nDuring the war, in 1918, twin sisters Genevieve and Lucille Baker of the Naval Coastal Defense Reserve became the first uniformed women to serve in the Coast Guard.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130328085505/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international |archivedate=28 March 2013 |title=Women in the military \u2013 international |date=30 May 2006 |work=CBC News | url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=WHC>\"Women's History Chronology\", Women & the U.

The effort was not entirely successful, due to the slowness of the destroyers.  However, the mission provided many Coast Guard officers and [[petty officer]]s with operational experience which proved invaluable in [[World War II]]. The Navy's epithet of \"Hooligan Navy\" dates from this era, due to the Coast Guard's flexibility in enlisting men discharged from other services to rapidly expand; it has endured due to the high proportion of prior-other-service enlisteds, and become a term of pride within the service.\n\n===1927 Mississippi River flood===\n\nDuring the disastrous [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|1927 Mississippi River flood]], the Coast Guard rescued a total of 43,853 persons who they \"removed from perilous positions to places of safety\".  Additionally, they saved 11,313 head of livestock and furnished transportation for 72 persons in need of hospitalization.  In all 674 Coast Guardsmen and 128 Coast Guard vessels and boats served in the relief operations.<ref name=Johnson99>Johnson, p 99</ref>\n\n==The 1930s==\n\n===Increasing regulation of merchant shipping===\nThe Steamboat Inspection Service was merged with the Bureau of Navigation, created in 1884, to oversee the regulation of merchant seamen, on 30 June 1932.\n\nIn 1934, the passenger vessel [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] suffered a serious fire off the coast of New Jersey, which ultimately claimed the lives of 124 passenger and crew.  The casualty prompted new [[fire protection]] standards for vessels and paved the way for the \"Act of May 27, 1936\", which reorganized and changed the name of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service to the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation.\n\nMarine inspection and navigation duties under the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard by executive order on 28 February 1942. This transfer of duties fit well with the Coast Guard's port safety and security missions, and was made permanent in 1946.\n<ref>[https://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166737/ \"Statement of Admiral Thad w.

The [[Greenland Patrol]] was maintained by the Coast Guard for the duration of the war.\n\n[[File:These Negro members of a Coast Guard Horse Patrol unit patrol beaches in the New Jersey area in all kinds of weather. - NARA - 535853.jpg|thumb|US Coast Guard Horse Patrol, circa 1941-45]]\n\n[[File:Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese planes view.jpg|thumb|Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese planes view]]\nThe Coast Guard became directly involved in the first WW2 attack on America in the 1941 [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Supporting U.S. naval forces on December 7, were the Coast Guard cutters, patrol boats, bases, stations, lighthouses and personnel assigned to the 14th Naval District. These units included high-endurance cutter Taney and patrol cutters Tiger and Reliance; buoy tenders Kukui and Walnut; patrol boats CG-400, CG-403, CG-27, and CG-8; a buoy boat and the former Lighthouse Service launch Lehua all participated in the battle shooting at several aircraft.

Gale-force winds had slowed her progress and she was running low on fuel.  Too far from Newfoundland and unable to make it back to Ireland, the captain, Charles Martin, twenty-six-year-old ex-Navy pilot, decided to fly toward  {{USCGC|Bibb|WPG-31|}} which was on [[Ocean Station Charlie]] in the North Atlantic.  The plane's captain decided to ditch and have his passengers and crew picked up by ''Bibb''.  In 30-foot (10 m) seas, the transfer was both difficult and dangerous.  Initially the ''Bibb's'' captain, Capt. Paul B. Cronk, tried to pass a line to the plane which taxied to the lee side of the cutter.  A collision with the cutter ended this attempt to save the passengers.  With worsening weather, a fifteen-man rubber raft and a small boat were deployed from the ship.  The raft was guided to the escape door of the aircraft.  Passengers jumped into the raft which was then pulled to the boat.  After rescuing 47 of the passengers, worsening conditions and the approach of darkness forced the rescue's suspension.  By dawn, improved weather allowed the rescue to resume and the remaining passengers and crew were transferred to the ''Bibb''.  The rescue made headlines throughout the country and upon their arrival in Boston, ''Bibb'' and her crew received a hero's welcome for having saved all those aboard the ditched ''Bermuda Sky Queen''.<ref name=CGN /><ref>{{British pathe|13803| Newsreel footage of 1947 Bermuda Sky Queen incident}}.

However, the [[Magnuson\u2013Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976]] brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired.\n\n===The Kudirka incident===\n{{wikisource|President Ford\u2013Henry Kissinger\u2013Jerrold Schecter memcon (5 September 1974)#A1|President Ford memcon (5 September 1974)}}\nOn 23 November 1970, Simonas \"Simas\" Kudirka, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] seaman of [[Lithuania]]n nationality, leapt from the 400-foot (120&nbsp;m) mother ship ''Sovetskaya Litva'', anchored in American waters (near [[Aquinnah]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]] Island), aboard the [[USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617)|USCGC ''Vigilant'']], sailing from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe.  Ten hours passed; communications difficulties contributed to the delay, as the ship was unfortunately in a \"blind spot\" of Boston Radio's (Marshfield) receivers, resulting in an awkward resort to using the public marine operator.\n\nAfter attempts to get the [[U.S. State Department]] to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to permit a [[KGB]] detachment to board the ''Vigilant'' to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship.  This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the [[UCMJ]].  Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive [[letter of reprimand]] and assigned to shore duty. Kudirka himself was tried for treason by the Soviet Union and given a ten-year sentence in prison. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and he was allowed to go to the United States in 1974.\n\nThe incident, known for several years as the Coast Guard's \"Day of Shame,\" was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, ''[[The Defection of Simas Kudirka]]'', with [[Alan Arkin]] playing Kudirka and [[Donald Pleasence]] playing the captain of the Soviet ship and USCGC ''Decisive'' playing the part of USCGC ''Vigilant''. It was also portrayed in the 1973 book ''Day of Shame: The truth about the murderous happenings aboard the Cutter Vigilant during the Russian-American confrontation off Martha's Vineyard'' by Algis Ruksenas.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zCcdAAAAMAAJ\n |title=Day of shame: the truth about the ... \u2013 Google Books\n |work=books.google.com\n |accessdate=25 November 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===The Rescue of AF586===\n\nAt 1430 on 26 October 1978, \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\", a Navy P-3C flying with a crew of fifteen on a reconnaissance mission from the VP-9 detachment at Naval Station Adak, Alaska, ditched near position {{coord|52|39|N|167|24|E}} (approximately 290 miles west of [[Shemya|Shemya Island]] in the Aleutians) following a propeller malfunction and succession of engine fires in its number one engine. VP 9's Aircraft Accident Report recorded conditions at the time of ditching as \"1500 foot ceiling, one and one-half to three miles visibility in rain showers, wave height 12-20 feet, winds 223 degrees at 43 knots.\" Water temperature was approximately 40 degrees. The aircraft sank within 90 seconds.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GnmwMBeSLzAC |title= Adak: The Rescue of Alfa Foxtrot 586 |first=Andrew |last= Jampoler |publisher= Naval Institute Press |year= 2012 |ISBN= 9781612510743}}</ref>\n\nThe crew of Coast Guard HC-130H CGNR 1500 were instrumental in saving the lives of ten crew members from Navy P3C PD-2 \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\" (Bureau No. 159892) after that aircraft ditched in the North Pacific Ocean west of Shemya Island on 26 October 1978. Arriving on scene after dark in turbulent weather, CG 1500 marked the reported position of the survivors' rafts with a buoy and smoke floats, proceeded to and established communications with a Soviet fishing vessel, Mys Sinyavin, located approximately 25 miles west of datum, and then directed that vessel to both rafts, ultimately resulting in the rescue of ten survivors and the recovery of three dead crewmembers from AF 586. The latter died from exposure after approximately ten - twelve hours in the water-laden rafts, and it is unlikely that the other ten crewmembers could have survived in their rafts much longer as they were all in the advanced stages of hypothermia when rescued by Mys Sinyavin.<ref>https://www.uscg.mil/history/aviation/docs/SAR_1978_CG1500.pdf</ref>\n\n==The 1980s==\n\n===The ''Blackthorn'' Tragedy===\nOn 28 January 1980, the 180-foot buoy tender {{USCGC|Blackthorn|WLB-391}} collided with the 605-foot oil tanker SS ''Capricorn'' and capsized when the ''Capricorn'''s anchor entangled the cutter. Twenty-three Coast Guardsmen were drowned. Coming close behind the loss of 11 men in the collision/sinking of the OCS training ship [[USCGC Cuyahoga (WIX-157)|USCGC ''Cuyahoga'']], the impact of this disaster upon morale in the close-knit service was magnified.<ref>Coast Guard Reserve Magazine, March 2000. \"The 20th Anniversary of the CGC Blackthorn Tragedy\" http://www.uscg.mil/RESERVE/magazine/mag2000/mar2000/blackthorn.htm</ref>\n\n===''Prinsendam'' rescue===\nOn 4 October 1980, the Coast Guard and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] were involved in the rescue of the passengers and crew of the Dutch cruise vessel {{MS|Prinsendam|1973|6}} in the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nA fire broke out on the ''Prinsendam'' off Yakutat, Alaska on 4 October 1980.  The ''Prinsendam'' was {{convert|130|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from the nearest airstrip.  The cruise ship's captain ordered the ship abandoned and the passengers, many elderly, left the ship in the lifeboats.  Coast Guard and Canadian helicopters and the cutters ''[[USCGC Boutwell (WHEC-719)|Boutwell]]'', ''[[USCGC Mellon (WHEC-717)|Mellon]]'', and ''[[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|Woodrush]]'' responded in concert with other vessels in the area. The passenger vessel later capsized and sank.  The rescue is particularly important because of the distance traveled by the rescuers, the coordination of independent organizations and the fact that all 520 passengers and crew were rescued without loss of life or serious injury.<ref name=CGN />\n\n===''Marine Electric'' sinking===\n\nOn February 12, 1983, the cargo ship  ''[[SS Marine Electric]]'' sank in a storm off the coast of [[Virginia]]. Despite efforts by multiple Coast Guard and Navy vessels, most of the crew were lost. As a result of this, the Coast Guard undertook massive review of its rescue procedures, its ship inspection procedures, and its requirements for safety equipment aboard ships. <ref name=\"marine electric\"> [https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/marine-electric-the-wreck-that-changed-the-coast-guard-forever Marine Electric: The Wreck that Changed the Coast Guard Forever], By Corinne Zilnicki 2019-02-11 maritime-executive.com website. </ref> \n\nSome of the reforms that resulted included the items below. <ref name=\"marine electric\"/> \n\n* greater attention to inspection of deck hatch covers during ship inspections. \n* requirement for all ships to provide equipment for survival in cold water for all ship's crew personnel. \n* the establishment of the [[Coast Guard rescue swimmer]] program in 1984, in order to greatly improve readiness and training for all rescue swimmers.\n\n===The Mariel boatlift===\n\nIn April 1980, the government of [[Cuba]] began to allow any person who wanted to leave Cuba to assemble in [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]] Harbor and take their own transport.  The U.S. Coast Guard, working out of Seventh District Headquarters in Miami, Florida, rescued boats in difficulty, inspected vessels for adequate safety equipment, and processed refugees.  This task was made even more difficult by a hurricane which swamped many vessels in mid-ocean and by the lack of cooperation by Cuban Border Guard officials.  By May, 600 reservists had been called up, the U.S. Navy provided assistance between Cuba and [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and the Auxiliary was heavily involved.  125,000 refugees were processed between April and May 1980. (See [[Mariel boatlift]].)\n\n===The end of the lightships===\nThe number of lightships steadily decreased during the 20th century, some replaced by \"Texas Tower\" type structures (e.g., Chesapeake, Buzzards Bay, both now automated) [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.uscg.mil/history/Lightship_Index.html], and others by buoys. However, the Columbia River and Nantucket Shoals Lightships were not replaced by large navigational buoys (LNBs) until 1979 and 1983, respectively, due to the difficulty of anchoring buoys securely at their heavy-weather locations. [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=554].\n\nThe technology of all aids to navigation evolved dramatically during this era, reducing manning and maintenance requirements. The Coast Guard also managed the worldwide VLF [[OMEGA Navigation System]] and operated two of its stations from the early 1970s until its termination in 1997 (having been superseded, though not truly obsoleted, by GPS).\n\n=== Drug War at sea escalates ===\nDuring the 1980s, Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were increasingly deployed to intervene drugs far offshore. While the service has interdicted contraband since its inception, the \"Drug War\" was the biggest effort since Prohibition. Though the Drug War began before the 1980s and continues to this day, it was during the 1980s that the Coast Guard, working with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and other law enforcement agencies, used a blend of new and old laws to interdict far from the shores of the United States. Formerly, it was more difficult to prosecute cases involving seizures made beyond 24 nautical miles from shore. President Ronald Reagan's efforts to secure funding for federal agencies and courts to prosecute cases got the Coast Guard's attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The Coast Guard instituted a \"no tolerance\" policy toward drugs, began testing its own employees for drug use, and required that all boardings be carried out by trained and armed boarding officers and petty officers. The Caribbean was the focus of efforts in the 1980s, but in recent years the major drug busts at sea have been occurring more in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between California and Peru.\n\n===Libyan attack on LORAN Station Lampedusa===\nOn 15 April 1986, [[Libya]] fired two [[Scud]]s at the U.S. Coast Guard [[LORAN|radio navigation]] station on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], in retaliation for the American bombing of [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As a result of the attack, the Coast Guard station was commissioned as a NATO base, including security hardening and an armory, as well as an Italian security detail stationed nearby.\n\n===Exxon Valdez oil spill===\nIn March 1989, the oil tanker ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' struck [[Prince William Sound]]'s [[Bligh Reef]] and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels (41,000 to 119,000 m3) of crude oil. Because the incident took place in navigational waters, the Coast Guard had authority for all activities relating to the cleanup effort. The Coast Guard largely served as the [[Federal On Scene Coordinator|Federal On-Scene Coordinator]] between [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]] and all of these organizations, acting within authority under the [[Clean Water Act]].\n\nCoast Guard cutters were one of the first to respond to the spill, quickly establishing a safety zone around the stricken ''Exxon Valdez''. At least eleven cutters were present in April 1989, the majority of them overseeing booming and skimming operations. Early that month, Coast Guard vessel activity went through a rapid buildup phase. The Coast Guard maintained a heavy cutter presence for two weeks in mid-April and then reduced it towards the end of the month. Four or five cutters were on hand in early May and that number was reduced to two or three by the end of the month. Three cutters were assigned to cleanup operations by the beginning of June, but only one remained two weeks later \u2013 and it stayed that way for the remainder of the 1989 response.\n\nSeveral [[C-130]]s from [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak]] airlifted more than 11 \u00bc tons of cleanup equipment by 10 April 1989. [[Dassault Falcon 20|HU-25 Falcon]] jets from [[Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod]] flew twice a day tracking oil with side-looking radar equipment. Five Coast Guard helicopters also assisted thirty-nine skimmers working in Prince William Sound.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/EV.pdf]\n\n==The 1990s==\n\n==='90 Operation Desert Shield===\n[[File:Harbor patrol during Operation Desert Shield.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Members of Port Security Unit 302 patrol the harbor aboard a Navy harbor patrol boat during Operation Desert Shield.]]\nOn 17 August 1990, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary of Transportation and the Commandant of the Coast Guard committed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) to [[Operation Desert Shield]].  A total of 10 four-person teams served in-theater to support the enforcement of UN sanctions by the Maritime Interdiction Forces.  Approximately 60 percent of the 600 boardings carried out by U.S. forces were either led by or supported with the LEDETs.  Additionally, a 7-man liaison staff was designated by the Commandant as Operational Commander for the Coast Guard forces deployed in theater.  The first boarding of an Iraqi vessel in the theater of operations conducted by a LEDET occurred on 30 August 1990. President George H. W. Bush, on 22 August 1990, authorized the call up of members of the selected reserve to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield.  Three Port Security Units (PSU), consisting of 550 Coast Guard reservists are ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. This was the first involuntary overseas mobilization of Coast Guard Reserve PSUs in the Coast Guard Reserve's 50-year history.  A total of 950 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\">http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/PersianGulfChron.asp</ref>\n\n==='91 Operation Desert Storm===\nPrior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, Coast Guard LEDET personnel aboard the {{USS|Nicholas|FFG-47|}} assisted when the frigate cleared eleven Iraqi oil platforms and took 23 prisoners on 18 January 1991.  On 21 April 1991, a Tactical Port Security Boat (TPSB) of PSU 301, stationed in [[Al Jubayl]], Saudi Arabia, was the first boat in the newly reopened harbor of [[Mina Ash Shuwaikh]] in Kuwait City.  Because of certain security concerns, a determination was made to send one of the 22-foot Raider boats belonging to PSU 301 and armed with [[M2 machine gun|M2]] and [[M60 machine gun]]s, to lead the procession into the harbor and provide security for the operation.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/>\n\nDuring the war, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army was seeking to pollute the Persian Gulf by pouring oil into in an effort only partly stymied when Air Force F-111F Aardvarks bombed the source of the deliberate spill. A giant slick was spreading rapidly, wreaking environmental havoc and threatening Saudi desalinization plants that supplied potable water for coalition troops. Two HU-25B Guardians from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., were dispatched 13 Feb 1991, supported by two HC-130H Hercules from CGAS Clearwater Florida, Operating from Saudi and Bahraini airfields. The HC-130s brought in supplies and returned to the United States 25 Feb.. The HU-25Bs flew over the oil spill to monitor dispersion, rate of flow, the effects of weather and currents, and other data essential for preparing a response plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/gulf-war-20th-coast-guard-aviators-battled-saddam-husseins-oil-spill/|title=Gulf War 20th: Coast Guard Aviators Battled Saddam Hussein's Oil Spill \u2013 Defense Media Network|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Buckshot, \"The Great Flood of '93\"===\nDuring April and again in June 1993, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis (CGF)was activated for flooding on the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois River basins. The '500 year' flooding closed over {{convert|1250|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of river to navigation and claimed 47 lives. Historic levels of rainfall in the river tributaries caused many levee breaks along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers displacing thousands of people from their homes and businesses. The commander of CGF St. Louis set into motion a preconceived operations plan to deal with the many requests for assistance from state and local governments for law enforcement assistance, help with sandbagging, water rescues, evacuation of flood victims, and aerial surveillance of levee conditions. The unprecedented duration of the flood also caused Coast Guard personnel to assume some humanitarian services not normally a part of flood operations. Food, water and sandbags were transported to work sites to assist sandbagging efforts by local governments. Red Cross and Salvation Army relief workers were given transportation assistance. Many homeless animals displaced by the flood waters were rescued and turned over to local animal shelters. Utility repair crews were assisted with transportation of personnel and repair parts. Disaster Response Units (DRU) were formed from active duty and reserve units throughout the Second Coast Guard District and consisted of eight members equipped with three 16-foot flood punts powered by 25 horsepower outboard motors. The DRU's accounted for 1517 boat sorties and 3342 hours of underway operations. Coast Guard helicopters from CG Air Stations in Traverse City and Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Elizabeth City, North Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama provided search and rescue, logistical support and aerial survey intelligence. The Coast Guard Auxiliary provided three fixed wing aircraft. There were 473 aircraft sorties with 570 hours of aircraft operations. CGF St. Louis stood down from the alert phase of operations on 27 August. A total of 380 Active Duty, 352 Reserve, 179 Auxiliary, and 5 Coast Guard civilians were involved in the operation.<ref>After Action Report for Operation Buckshot, Commander, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis, 2nd Coast Guard District, 15 August 1993</ref>\n\n===1994 Cuban boat rescues===\n[[File:USCGC Tamaroa WUEC-166 1990.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[USCGC Tamaroa|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']] (WMEC-166), best known for her rescues during the \"[[1991 Halloween Nor'easter|Perfect Storm]]\" of 1991.]]\nIn 1994, about 38,000 Cubans attempted to sail from Cuba to Florida, many on homemade rafts.  The Coast Guard and Navy performed intensive search and rescue efforts to rescue rafters at sea. Sixteen 110-foot (34 m) cutters\u2014half the complement of the Coast Guard\u2014were involved in this operation, as well as buoy tenders not normally assigned to high seas duty. Due to a change in Presidential policy, rescued Cubans were sent to the U.S. Naval Station at [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba.\n\n===1999 Kosovo===\nIn the summer of 1999, {{USCGC|Bear|WMEC-901}} deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of [[Operation Allied Force]] and [[Operation Noble Anvil]] with the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}} Battle Group providing surface surveillance and SAR response for the Sea Combat Commander, and force protection for the Amphibious Ready Group operating near Albania. The ''Bear'' also provided security to the US Army vessels transporting military cargo between Italy and Albania. This escort operation took ''Bear'' up to the Albanian coastline, well within enemy surface-to-surface missile range. ''Bear'' earned the [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]] and the [[NATO Kosovo Medal]].[http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/KosovoBear.pdf]\n\n==The 2000s==\n:''For details on the Coast Guard's response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], see [[Missions of the United States Coast Guard]] above.''\n\n===Transfer to the Department of Homeland Security===\nThe Coast Guard was transferred from the Department of Transportation to the [[Department of Homeland Security]] on 1 March 2003 under the [[Homeland Security Act]] (Public Law No. 107-296).\n\nIn 2002, the Coast Guard sent several 110-foot (34 m) cutters to the [[Persian Gulf]] to enforce the U.N. embargo on goods to and from [[Iraq]].

The Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] were merged to become the Coast Guard per {{USC|14|1}} which states: \"The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.\"  In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was merged into the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard itself was moved to the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. However, under {{USC|14|3}} as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when [[United States Congress|Congress]] so directs in the declaration, or when the [[President of the United States|President]] directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\n==Early history==\n===The Revenue-Marine===\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Lifesaving Service]], but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to authorize a [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|\"system of cutters\"]] to enforce tariffs, which was major source of revenue for the new nation. On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 40 revenue officers. Each cutter was assigned one master and three mates who were commissioned officers. In addition, each cutter was allowed four mariners and two boys. <ref name=Evans5>Evans, p.5</ref> The cutters were collectively referred to as the \"Revenue-Marine,\" and later officially organized as the \"Revenue Cutter Service.\" Initially, the  was not an organized service. Each revenue cutter operated independently, with each assigned to patrol a section of the east coast and reporting directly to the [[Customs House]] in a major port. From 1790, when the [[Continental Navy]] was disbanded, to 1798, when the [[United States Navy]] was created, these \"revenue cutters\" were the country's only naval force.<ref name=Evans14>Evans, p. 14</ref> As such, the cutters and their crews took on a wide variety of duties beyond the enforcement of tariffs, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail. In 1794, the Revenue-Marine was given the mission of preventing trading in slaves from Africa to the United States. Between 1794 and 1865, the Service captured approximately 500 slave ships. In 1808, the Service was responsible for enforcing President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s embargo closing U.S. ports to European trade. The 1822 Timber Act tasked the Revenue Cutter Service with protecting government timber from poachers (this is viewed as the beginning of the Coast Guard's environmental protection mission).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720081519/http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |archive-date=20 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During times of war or crisis, the revenue cutters and their crews were put at the disposal of the Navy. The Revenue-Marine involved in the [[Quasi-War]] with France from 1798 to 1799, the [[War of 1812]], and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\n===United States Revenue Cutter Service===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service.png|thumb|Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service]] \nDuring the [[American Civil War]], USRC ''[[USS Harriet Lane (1857)|Harriet Lane]]'' fired the first naval shots of the war, engaging the steamer ''Nashville'' during the siege of [[Fort Sumter]].<ref name=Evans75>Evans, p. 75</ref> Upon the order of President Lincoln to the Secretary of the Treasury on 14 June 1863, cutters were assigned to the [[North Atlantic Blockading Squadron]].

These stations were normally unoccupied \u2013 essentially storehouses for boats and equipment to be used by volunteers. With the signing of the Newell Act on August 14, 1848, Congress appropriated $10,000 to fund lifesaving stations along the east coast. These were loosely administered by the Revenue-Marine, but still dependent on volunteers (like many fire departments of the time).\n\nThis system continued until 1871 when [[Sumner Kimball]] was appointed Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Department. Kimball convinced Congress to appropriate $200,000 to construct new stations, repair old ones, and provide full-time crews. Shortly thereafter, in 1878, the U.S. Lifesaving Service was officially born and so-named.\n\nAlthough the Revenue Cutter Service is perhaps more recognized as ''the'' predecessor of the Coast Guard, the Lifesaving Service's legacy is apparent in many ways, not the least of which is the prominence of the Coast Guard's search and rescue mission in the eyes of the public. The Coast Guard takes its unofficial search and rescue motto, \"You have to go out, but you don't have to come back,\" from the 1899 regulations of the [[United States Life Saving Service]], which stated:\n\n<blockquote>In attempting a rescue the keeper will select either the boat, breeches buoy, or life car, as in his judgment is best suited to effectively cope with the existing conditions. If the device first selected fails after such trial as satisfies him that no further attempt with it is feasible, he will resort to one of the others, and if that fails, then to the remaining one, and he will not desist from his efforts until by actual trial the impossibility of effecting a rescue is demonstrated. The statement of the keeper that he did not try to use the boat because the sea or surf was too heavy will not be accepted unless attempts to launch it were actually made and failed [underlining added], or unless the conformation of the coast\u2014as bluffs, precipitous banks, etc.\u2014is such as to unquestionably preclude the use of a boat.</blockquote>\n\nThese regulations were repeated in the 1934 Coast Guard regulations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nA number of Coast Guard traditions survive from, or pay homage to, the Lifesaving Service as well. For example, members of the Lifesaving Service were referred to as \"surfmen,\" and today the [[Surfman Badge]] it awarded to [[coxswains]] who qualify to operate motor lifeboats in heavy surf conditions. The badge's design is similar to the Lifesaving Service's seal.\n\n===Coast Guard Academy===\nThe School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service was established in 1876, near New Bedford, Massachusetts. It used the [[USRC James C. Dobbin (1853)|USRC ''Dobbin'']] for its training exercises.  It moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and then again in 1910 to Fort Trumbull, near New London, Connecticut. The school provided a two-year premise to ship supplemented by some class work and tutoring in technical subjects.  In 1903, the third year of instruction was added.  The school was oriented to line officers, as engineers were hired directly from civilian life.  In 1906, an engineering program for cadets began. Nevertheless, the school remained small, with 5 to 10 cadets per class. In 1914 the School became the Revenue Cutter Academy and with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service in 1915, it became the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]]. In February 1929, Congress appropriated $1,750,000 for construction of buildings to be used for the academy. The city of New London purchased the land on the Thames River and donated it to the government for use as a Coast Guard facility. Construction began in 1931 and the first cadets began occupying the new facilities in 1932.<ref name=Johnson109>Johnson, p 109</ref>\n\n===Creation of the modern Coast Guard===\nOn 28 January 1915, the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service were merged by act of Congress to form the United States Coast Guard.<ref name=Johnson32>Johnson, p. 32</ref>  The [[United States Lighthouse Service]] which was the oldest government agency, dating from 7 August 1789, was absorbed by the Coast Guard on 1 July 1939.<ref name=Johnson161-162>Johnson, pp. 161\u2013162</ref> On 28 February 1942, the [[Steamboat Inspection Service|Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation]] was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/Steamboat_Inspection_Service.asp\n |title=Steamboat Inspection Service History\n |work=uscg.mil\n |accessdate=16 November 2010\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1920 the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce held hearings on merging the recently created Coast Guard into the United States Navy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdguAAAAMAAJ|title=Transfer of the Coast Guard to the Navy: Hearings Before the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives, Sixty-sixth Congress, Second Session, on H.R. 5516.

[[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] directed that although the Coast Guard was then a part of the Navy, that most of the administrative details handled by Coast Guard Headquarters would not be changed.  At the outset of the war the Coast Guard consisted of less than 4000 officers and men, had 23 cruising cutters, 21 harbor cutters, 272 rescue stations and 21 cadets at the Coast Guard Academy.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)11-16>Larzelere (2003), pp. 11\u201416</ref><ref name=Larzelere(2003)21>Larzelere (2003), p.21</ref> The Coast Guard was still in a formative stage of development from the merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Lifesaving Service.  Because of this fact, there was not much interaction between the two former entities during the war.  A qualified Lifesaving Service surfman who wished to transfer to a cutter had to be reduced to ordinary seaman upon reporting because of a lack of shipboard skills. Because of this transfers were infrequent.  There were no chief petty officers in the Coast Guard at this time and Coast Guard petty officers assigned to Navy ships often served under less experienced supervisors for less pay.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)19>Larzelere (2003), p. 19</ref>\n\n\nCoast Guard cutters were seen by the Navy as ready assets and were used to fill in for a rapidly expanding Navy.  The Navy recognized Coast Guard officers and petty officers as the experienced mariners that they were and often put them on Navy ships to fill in for crew shortages and lack of experience.\n\n=== Sinking of USCGC Tampa ===\nDuring the late afternoon of 26 September 1918, ''Tampa'' parted company with convoy HG-107, which she had just escorted into the [[Irish Sea]] from Gibraltar.

According to the submarine war diary entry, the U-boat dived and maneuvered into an attack position, firing one torpedo out of the stern tube at 2015 from a range of about 550 meters. Minutes later, the torpedo hit ''Tampa'' and exploded portside amidships, throwing up a huge, luminous column of water.<ref name=Johnson55>Johnson, p 55</ref> The cutter sank with all hands: 111 Coast Guardsmen, 4 U.S. Navy sailors, and 16 passengers consisting of 11 [[Royal Navy]] sailors and 5 [[United States Maritime Service|Maritime Service Merchant Marines]].<ref name=Larzelere(2003)49>Larzelere (2003), p. 49</ref> The sinking of ''Tampa'' was the largest single loss of Coast Guard personnel in the war.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)50>Larzelere (2003), p. 50</ref> She sank in the [[Bristol Channel]] at roughly {{coord|50|40|N|6|19|W}}.<ref name=DANFS>''Tampa'', Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, U.S. Navy Naval History & Heritage Command</ref>\n\n\nDuring the war, in 1918, twin sisters Genevieve and Lucille Baker of the Naval Coastal Defense Reserve became the first uniformed women to serve in the Coast Guard.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130328085505/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international |archivedate=28 March 2013 |title=Women in the military \u2013 international |date=30 May 2006 |work=CBC News | url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=WHC>\"Women's History Chronology\", Women & the U.

The effort was not entirely successful, due to the slowness of the destroyers.  However, the mission provided many Coast Guard officers and [[petty officer]]s with operational experience which proved invaluable in [[World War II]]. The Navy's epithet of \"Hooligan Navy\" dates from this era, due to the Coast Guard's flexibility in enlisting men discharged from other services to rapidly expand; it has endured due to the high proportion of prior-other-service enlisteds, and become a term of pride within the service.\n\n===1927 Mississippi River flood===\n\nDuring the disastrous [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|1927 Mississippi River flood]], the Coast Guard rescued a total of 43,853 persons who they \"removed from perilous positions to places of safety\".  Additionally, they saved 11,313 head of livestock and furnished transportation for 72 persons in need of hospitalization.  In all 674 Coast Guardsmen and 128 Coast Guard vessels and boats served in the relief operations.<ref name=Johnson99>Johnson, p 99</ref>\n\n==The 1930s==\n\n===Increasing regulation of merchant shipping===\nThe Steamboat Inspection Service was merged with the Bureau of Navigation, created in 1884, to oversee the regulation of merchant seamen, on 30 June 1932.\n\nIn 1934, the passenger vessel [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] suffered a serious fire off the coast of New Jersey, which ultimately claimed the lives of 124 passenger and crew.  The casualty prompted new [[fire protection]] standards for vessels and paved the way for the \"Act of May 27, 1936\", which reorganized and changed the name of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service to the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation.\n\nMarine inspection and navigation duties under the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard by executive order on 28 February 1942. This transfer of duties fit well with the Coast Guard's port safety and security missions, and was made permanent in 1946.\n<ref>[https://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166737/ \"Statement of Admiral Thad w.

The [[Greenland Patrol]] was maintained by the Coast Guard for the duration of the war.\n\n[[File:These Negro members of a Coast Guard Horse Patrol unit patrol beaches in the New Jersey area in all kinds of weather. - NARA - 535853.jpg|thumb|US Coast Guard Horse Patrol, circa 1941-45]]\n\n[[File:Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese planes view.jpg|thumb|Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese planes view]]\nThe Coast Guard became directly involved in the first WW2 attack on America in the 1941 [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Supporting U.S. naval forces on December 7, were the Coast Guard cutters, patrol boats, bases, stations, lighthouses and personnel assigned to the 14th Naval District. These units included high-endurance cutter Taney and patrol cutters Tiger and Reliance; buoy tenders Kukui and Walnut; patrol boats CG-400, CG-403, CG-27, and CG-8; a buoy boat and the former Lighthouse Service launch Lehua all participated in the battle shooting at several aircraft. Coast Guard aviator, Lt. Frank Erickson, who later pioneered search and rescue helicopter flight, was standing watch at Ford Island before the attack then took command of an anti-aircraft battery to fight off multiple enemy aircraft.\n\nThe {{USCGC|Taney|WHEC-37|}}, a notable [[World War II]] era high endurance cutter, is the only warship still afloat today (as a [[museum ship]] in [[Baltimore]]) that was present for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, although she was actually stationed in nearby Honolulu.\n\n\nDuring World War II, there was great concern about enemy vessels nearing U.S. shores, allowing adversarial forces to invade the nation. The beach patrols gained increased importance as security forces with three basic functions: to look for and report on any suspicious vessels operating in the area; to report and prevent attempts of landings by the enemy; and to prevent communication between persons on shore and the enemy at sea.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Stephanie |title=Mounted beach patrol: When the service saddled up |url=https://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2012/08/mounted-beach-patrol-when-the-service-saddled-up |website=Coast Guard Compass |publisher=US Coast Guard |accessdate=13 September 2019 |date=August 28, 2012}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe {{USCGC|Modoc|WPG-46|}}, was peripherally involved in the chase and sinking of the German [[battleship]] [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']].\n\nShortly after Germany declared war on the United States, German [[submarine]]s began [[Second happy time|Operation Drumbeat]] ''(\"Paukenschlag\"),'' <!-- was (\"Kesselpauke\"),--> sinking ships off the American coast.  Many Coast Guard cutters were involved in rescue operations following German attacks on American shipping.  The {{USCGC|Icarus|WPC-110|}}, a 165-foot (50 m) cutter that previously had been a rumrunner chaser during [[Prohibition]], sank [[German submarine U-352|''U-352'']] on 9 May 1942, off the coast of [[Cape Lookout, North Carolina]], and took 33 prisoners, the first Germans taken in combat by any U.S. force.\n\nThe {{USCGC|Thetis|WPC-115|}} sank [[German submarine U-157 (1941)|''U-157'']] on 10 June 1942.  During the war, Coast Guard units sank 12 German and two Japanese submarines and captured two German surface vessels.\n\nWhen the {{USCGC|Campbell|WPG-32|}} rammed and sank the German U-606, her enlisted mascot [[Sinbad (USCG)|Sinbad]] became a public hero at home and brought attention to the role of the Coast Guard in convoy protection.\n\nCoast Guardsmen also patrolled the shores of the United States during the war. On 13 June 1942 Seaman 2nd Class John Cullen, patrolling the beach in [[Amagansett, New York]], discovered the first landing of German saboteurs in [[Operation Pastorius]].  Cullen was the first American who actually came in contact with the enemy on the shores of the United States during the war and his report led to the capture of the German sabotage team. For this, Cullen received the [[Legion of Merit]].<ref>http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/cb/PDFs/Sept_2005.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard had 30 [[Edsall class destroyer escort]]s under its command that were used primarily for [[Convoy#World War II|convoy]] escort duty in the [[Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=US Navy Destroyer Escorts|url=http://www.pxarchive.de/home/navy/des.html|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> Other United States Navy ships under Coast Guard command included:<ref name=mfw>{{cite book |last=Willoughby |first=Malcolm F. |authorlink = |title =The U.S. Coast Guard in World War II |url=https://archive.org/details/uscoastguardinw00will |url-access=registration |publisher =[[United States Naval Institute]] |volume = |edition = |date =1957 |location =[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |pages=169&170 |isbn =}}</ref>\n* 75 [[Tacoma-class frigate|patrol frigates]]\n*  8 [[Flower-class corvette]]s\n* 22 [[Troopship]]s\n* 20 [[Amphibious cargo ship]]s\n*  9 [[Attack transport]]s\n* 76 [[Landing Ship, Tank]]\n* 28 [[Landing Craft Infantry]]\n* 18 [[Mettawee class gasoline tanker|gasoline tankers]]\n* 10 [[Submarine chaser]]s\n* 40 [[Yard patrol boat]]s\n\nIn addition to antisubmarine operations,<ref>{{cite video\n | year =1945\n | title =Video: Santo Tomas Prisoners Liberated, 1945/03/01 (1945)\n | url =https://archive.org/details/1945-03-01_Santo_Tomas_Prisoners_Liberated\n | publisher =[[Universal Newsreel]]\n | accessdate =21 February 2012\n}}</ref> the Coast Guard worked closely with the U.S. Navy and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]].

Coast Guard cutters and ships partially crewed by Coast Guardsmen were used in the North African invasion of November 1942 ([[Operation Torch]]) and the invasion of [[Sicily]] in 1943 ([[Operation Husky]]).

Gale-force winds had slowed her progress and she was running low on fuel.  Too far from Newfoundland and unable to make it back to Ireland, the captain, Charles Martin, twenty-six-year-old ex-Navy pilot, decided to fly toward  {{USCGC|Bibb|WPG-31|}} which was on [[Ocean Station Charlie]] in the North Atlantic.  The plane's captain decided to ditch and have his passengers and crew picked up by ''Bibb''.  In 30-foot (10 m) seas, the transfer was both difficult and dangerous.  Initially the ''Bibb's'' captain, Capt. Paul B. Cronk, tried to pass a line to the plane which taxied to the lee side of the cutter.  A collision with the cutter ended this attempt to save the passengers.  With worsening weather, a fifteen-man rubber raft and a small boat were deployed from the ship.  The raft was guided to the escape door of the aircraft.  Passengers jumped into the raft which was then pulled to the boat.  After rescuing 47 of the passengers, worsening conditions and the approach of darkness forced the rescue's suspension.  By dawn, improved weather allowed the rescue to resume and the remaining passengers and crew were transferred to the ''Bibb''.

The first five cutters arrived on 4 May<ref name=Larzelerexxi>Larzelere, p xxi</ref> \n\nSeveral Coast Guard aviators served with the [[U.S. Air Force]] [[37th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron]] and [[40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron]] in Southeast Asia from 1968 to 1972. They were involved in combat search and rescue operations in both Vietnam and Laos.<ref>http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/KaliszThomasCGAviationVTN.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard provided Explosive Loading Detachments (ELD) to the [[U.S. Army]] [[1st Logistics Command]] in several locations in Vietnam.  The ELD's were responsible for the supervision of Army stevedores in the unloading of explosives and ammunition from U.S. Merchant Marine ships. The ELD's were also responsible for assisting the Army in port security operations at each port and eventually were made a part of a Port Security and Waterways Detail (PS&WD) reporting to the Commanding General, United States Army, Vietnam ([[USARV]]). They earned the Army [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for their efforts.\n\nOn 13 December 1965 [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] requested Coast Guard assistance in constructing a chain of [[LORAN-C]] stations for use by naval vessels and combat aircraft for operations in Southeast Asia.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)193>Larzelere (1997), p. 193</ref> Construction started almost immediately at five locations in Thailand and Vietnam and they were fully operational on 28 October 1966.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)203>Larzelere (1997), p. 203</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 1966, {{USCGC|Planetree|WLB-307|}} arrived in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] to commence [[Aids to Navigation]] (ATON) operations in the coastal waters of South Vietnam. She was responsible for the marking of freshly cut channels and harbors with buoys and daymarks so that merchant and naval ships could safely navigate the waters. This direct support mission ended on 17 May 1971 with the departure of the last buoy tender, {{USCGC|Blackhaw|WLB-390|}}. The buoy tender crews were tasked with training South Vietnamese crews in the ATON effort prior to the departure of the ''Blackhaw'' as a part of the '[[Vietnamization]]' policy of the Nixon Administration.  After May 1971 ATON was serviced on a 'as needed' basis by {{USCGC|Basswood|WLB-388|}} homeported in Guam.\n\nIn August 1970 the Coast Guard finished turning over to the South Vietnamese Navy the patrol boats of Squadron One. The training of South Vietnamese crews had started in February 1969 and continued through to the end of operations for Squadron One. {{USCGC|Yakutat|WHEC-380|}} and {{USCGC|Bering Strait|WHEC-382|}} were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy on 1 January 1971. Eventually three other WHECs were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy. The Coast Guard's involvement in the Vietnam War ended at 1246 local time 29 April 1975 when LORAN Station [[Con Son Island#LORAN Station Con Son|Con Son]] went off the air for good. Its signal was necessary for the safe evacuation of Saigon by [[U.S. Embassy]] personnel in the final days before the fall of the South Vietnamese government and it was kept on the air as long as possible.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)279>Larzelere (1997), p. 279</ref> On 3 October 1975 the Coast Guard disestablished the remaining LORAN-C stations in Thailand.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)xxv>Larzelere (1997), p. xxv</ref>\n\nSeven Coast Guardsmen were killed during the war in combat and search and rescue operations.<ref name=Johnson336>Johnson, p 336</ref> Additionally, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has determined that Coast Guard veterans who served aboard designated vessels while deployed to Vietnam during the war are \"eligible for the presumption of [[Agent Orange]] herbicide exposure\".<ref name=\"VAAO\">{{cite web |url=https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/docs/shiplist.docx |format=DOCX |title=Navy and Coast Guard Ships Associated with Service in Vietnam and Exposure to Herbicide Agents |last= |first= |date=2 Jul 2018 |website=Veterans Exposed to Agent Orange - Compensation |publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |access-date=18 Aug 2018 |quote=All U.S. Coast Guard Cutters with hull designation WPB [Patrol Boat], WHEC [High Endurance Cutter], WLB [Buoy Tender], and WAK [Cargo Vessel] during their Vietnam tours}}</ref> The vessels include U.S. Coast Guard Patrol Boats (WPBs), High Endurance Cutters (WHECs), Buoy Tenders (WLBs), and Cargo Vessels (WAKs).<ref name=VAAO/>\n\n==The 1970s==\n\n===The \"New Guard\"===\nIn the mid-70s the Coast Guard adopted the blue uniforms seen today, replacing Navy-style uniforms worn prior to the Vietnam War.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/Uniforms_CPO_Photos.asp\n |title=Uniforms\n |work=uscg.mil\n |accessdate=16 November 2010\n}}</ref> Known jocularly as \"[[Chester R.

It is noteworthy that the enlisted's and officer's uniforms differed ''only'' in rank insignia and cap devices, reflecting the value the service placed on its enlisted members (although it caused saluting confusion among members of other services). The stylish new women's uniform was created by Hollywood costume designer [[Edith Head]], upon the request of Capt. Eleanor L'Ecuyer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/062700/Seniority/She_made_her_mark_on_.shtml|title=Seniority: She made her mark on the Coast Guard|publisher=}}</ref> Enlisted uniform buttons were gold while officer's buttons were silver.  This was just opposite of most military services. Women were integrated into the Coast Guard during the 1970s, beginning with the end of the separate Women's Reserve (SPARS) in 1973, the modification of 378's for mixed-gender crews beginning in 1977, and the opening of all ratings to women in 1978. These stages of integration preceded the DOD military by roughly a year or so, as separate legislation restricted their deployment of women.<ref name=USCGHO7>{{cite web|last=Tilley|first=John A.|title=A History of Women in the Coast Guard|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/WomeninCG.pdf|work=Commandant's Bulletin (March 1996)|publisher=US Coast Guard Historians Office|accessdate=21 October 2012|format=pdf}}</ref>\n\nAltogether, the shift from Treasury to the DOT in 1967, the uniform change, the end of Ocean Station service, growth of the shore-side establishment by newly added missions, the steady if belated retirement of venerable but aging World War II cutters, and gender integration marked the oft-lamented end of the \"Old Guard\" (\"wooden ships and men of steel\").\n\nThe [[Ancient Order of the Pterodactyl]] was founded in 1977 in order to preserve the history of Coast Guard aviation, as the service's last amphibious seaplane, the [[HU-16 Albatross|Grumman Albatross]] or \"Goat,\" was nearing retirement, as was also the service's last enlisted pilot, John P. Greathouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbase.com/donboyd/image/59585407|title=IN MEMORIAM for ADCMAP John Pershing Greathouse, USCG \u2013 the last enlisted Coastie pilot by Don Boyd|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fredsplace.org/obit/obituary.shtml|title=Military and Veteran Benefits, News, Veteran Jobs|first=|last=Military.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===End of ocean stations, beginning of the {{convert|200|nmi|km|sigfig=2}} limit===\nOne major mission of the service, maintaining [[weather ship|Ocean Stations]], came to an end as improvements in oceanic aviation (turbojet airliners and improved radionavigation) obviated the need. However, the [[Magnuson\u2013Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976]] brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired.\n\n===The Kudirka incident===\n{{wikisource|President Ford\u2013Henry Kissinger\u2013Jerrold Schecter memcon (5 September 1974)#A1|President Ford memcon (5 September 1974)}}\nOn 23 November 1970, Simonas \"Simas\" Kudirka, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] seaman of [[Lithuania]]n nationality, leapt from the 400-foot (120&nbsp;m) mother ship ''Sovetskaya Litva'', anchored in American waters (near [[Aquinnah]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]] Island), aboard the [[USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617)|USCGC ''Vigilant'']], sailing from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe.  Ten hours passed; communications difficulties contributed to the delay, as the ship was unfortunately in a \"blind spot\" of Boston Radio's (Marshfield) receivers, resulting in an awkward resort to using the public marine operator.\n\nAfter attempts to get the [[U.S. State Department]] to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to permit a [[KGB]] detachment to board the ''Vigilant'' to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship.  This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the [[UCMJ]].  Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive [[letter of reprimand]] and assigned to shore duty. Kudirka himself was tried for treason by the Soviet Union and given a ten-year sentence in prison. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and he was allowed to go to the United States in 1974.\n\nThe incident, known for several years as the Coast Guard's \"Day of Shame,\" was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, ''[[The Defection of Simas Kudirka]]'', with [[Alan Arkin]] playing Kudirka and [[Donald Pleasence]] playing the captain of the Soviet ship and USCGC ''Decisive'' playing the part of USCGC ''Vigilant''. It was also portrayed in the 1973 book ''Day of Shame: The truth about the murderous happenings aboard the Cutter Vigilant during the Russian-American confrontation off Martha's Vineyard'' by Algis Ruksenas.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zCcdAAAAMAAJ\n |title=Day of shame: the truth about the ... \u2013 Google Books\n |work=books.google.com\n |accessdate=25 November 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===The Rescue of AF586===\n\nAt 1430 on 26 October 1978, \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\", a Navy P-3C flying with a crew of fifteen on a reconnaissance mission from the VP-9 detachment at Naval Station Adak, Alaska, ditched near position {{coord|52|39|N|167|24|E}} (approximately 290 miles west of [[Shemya|Shemya Island]] in the Aleutians) following a propeller malfunction and succession of engine fires in its number one engine. VP 9's Aircraft Accident Report recorded conditions at the time of ditching as \"1500 foot ceiling, one and one-half to three miles visibility in rain showers, wave height 12-20 feet, winds 223 degrees at 43 knots.\" Water temperature was approximately 40 degrees. The aircraft sank within 90 seconds.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GnmwMBeSLzAC |title= Adak: The Rescue of Alfa Foxtrot 586 |first=Andrew |last= Jampoler |publisher= Naval Institute Press |year= 2012 |ISBN= 9781612510743}}</ref>\n\nThe crew of Coast Guard HC-130H CGNR 1500 were instrumental in saving the lives of ten crew members from Navy P3C PD-2 \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\" (Bureau No. 159892) after that aircraft ditched in the North Pacific Ocean west of Shemya Island on 26 October 1978. Arriving on scene after dark in turbulent weather, CG 1500 marked the reported position of the survivors' rafts with a buoy and smoke floats, proceeded to and established communications with a Soviet fishing vessel, Mys Sinyavin, located approximately 25 miles west of datum, and then directed that vessel to both rafts, ultimately resulting in the rescue of ten survivors and the recovery of three dead crewmembers from AF 586. The latter died from exposure after approximately ten - twelve hours in the water-laden rafts, and it is unlikely that the other ten crewmembers could have survived in their rafts much longer as they were all in the advanced stages of hypothermia when rescued by Mys Sinyavin.<ref>https://www.uscg.mil/history/aviation/docs/SAR_1978_CG1500.pdf</ref>\n\n==The 1980s==\n\n===The ''Blackthorn'' Tragedy===\nOn 28 January 1980, the 180-foot buoy tender {{USCGC|Blackthorn|WLB-391}} collided with the 605-foot oil tanker SS ''Capricorn'' and capsized when the ''Capricorn'''s anchor entangled the cutter. Twenty-three Coast Guardsmen were drowned. Coming close behind the loss of 11 men in the collision/sinking of the OCS training ship [[USCGC Cuyahoga (WIX-157)|USCGC ''Cuyahoga'']], the impact of this disaster upon morale in the close-knit service was magnified.<ref>Coast Guard Reserve Magazine, March 2000. \"The 20th Anniversary of the CGC Blackthorn Tragedy\" http://www.uscg.mil/RESERVE/magazine/mag2000/mar2000/blackthorn.htm</ref>\n\n===''Prinsendam'' rescue===\nOn 4 October 1980, the Coast Guard and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] were involved in the rescue of the passengers and crew of the Dutch cruise vessel {{MS|Prinsendam|1973|6}} in the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nA fire broke out on the ''Prinsendam'' off Yakutat, Alaska on 4 October 1980.  The ''Prinsendam'' was {{convert|130|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from the nearest airstrip.  The cruise ship's captain ordered the ship abandoned and the passengers, many elderly, left the ship in the lifeboats.  Coast Guard and Canadian helicopters and the cutters ''[[USCGC Boutwell (WHEC-719)|Boutwell]]'', ''[[USCGC Mellon (WHEC-717)|Mellon]]'', and ''[[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|Woodrush]]'' responded in concert with other vessels in the area. The passenger vessel later capsized and sank.  The rescue is particularly important because of the distance traveled by the rescuers, the coordination of independent organizations and the fact that all 520 passengers and crew were rescued without loss of life or serious injury.<ref name=CGN />\n\n===''Marine Electric'' sinking===\n\nOn February 12, 1983, the cargo ship  ''[[SS Marine Electric]]'' sank in a storm off the coast of [[Virginia]]. Despite efforts by multiple Coast Guard and Navy vessels, most of the crew were lost. As a result of this, the Coast Guard undertook massive review of its rescue procedures, its ship inspection procedures, and its requirements for safety equipment aboard ships. <ref name=\"marine electric\"> [https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/marine-electric-the-wreck-that-changed-the-coast-guard-forever Marine Electric: The Wreck that Changed the Coast Guard Forever], By Corinne Zilnicki 2019-02-11 maritime-executive.com website. </ref> \n\nSome of the reforms that resulted included the items below. <ref name=\"marine electric\"/> \n\n* greater attention to inspection of deck hatch covers during ship inspections. \n* requirement for all ships to provide equipment for survival in cold water for all ship's crew personnel. \n* the establishment of the [[Coast Guard rescue swimmer]] program in 1984, in order to greatly improve readiness and training for all rescue swimmers.\n\n===The Mariel boatlift===\n\nIn April 1980, the government of [[Cuba]] began to allow any person who wanted to leave Cuba to assemble in [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]] Harbor and take their own transport.  The U.S. Coast Guard, working out of Seventh District Headquarters in Miami, Florida, rescued boats in difficulty, inspected vessels for adequate safety equipment, and processed refugees.  This task was made even more difficult by a hurricane which swamped many vessels in mid-ocean and by the lack of cooperation by Cuban Border Guard officials.  By May, 600 reservists had been called up, the U.S. Navy provided assistance between Cuba and [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and the Auxiliary was heavily involved.  125,000 refugees were processed between April and May 1980. (See [[Mariel boatlift]].)\n\n===The end of the lightships===\nThe number of lightships steadily decreased during the 20th century, some replaced by \"Texas Tower\" type structures (e.g., Chesapeake, Buzzards Bay, both now automated) [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.uscg.mil/history/Lightship_Index.html], and others by buoys. However, the Columbia River and Nantucket Shoals Lightships were not replaced by large navigational buoys (LNBs) until 1979 and 1983, respectively, due to the difficulty of anchoring buoys securely at their heavy-weather locations. [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=554].\n\nThe technology of all aids to navigation evolved dramatically during this era, reducing manning and maintenance requirements. The Coast Guard also managed the worldwide VLF [[OMEGA Navigation System]] and operated two of its stations from the early 1970s until its termination in 1997 (having been superseded, though not truly obsoleted, by GPS).\n\n=== Drug War at sea escalates ===\nDuring the 1980s, Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were increasingly deployed to intervene drugs far offshore. While the service has interdicted contraband since its inception, the \"Drug War\" was the biggest effort since Prohibition. Though the Drug War began before the 1980s and continues to this day, it was during the 1980s that the Coast Guard, working with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and other law enforcement agencies, used a blend of new and old laws to interdict far from the shores of the United States. Formerly, it was more difficult to prosecute cases involving seizures made beyond 24 nautical miles from shore. President Ronald Reagan's efforts to secure funding for federal agencies and courts to prosecute cases got the Coast Guard's attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The Coast Guard instituted a \"no tolerance\" policy toward drugs, began testing its own employees for drug use, and required that all boardings be carried out by trained and armed boarding officers and petty officers. The Caribbean was the focus of efforts in the 1980s, but in recent years the major drug busts at sea have been occurring more in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between California and Peru.\n\n===Libyan attack on LORAN Station Lampedusa===\nOn 15 April 1986, [[Libya]] fired two [[Scud]]s at the U.S. Coast Guard [[LORAN|radio navigation]] station on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], in retaliation for the American bombing of [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As a result of the attack, the Coast Guard station was commissioned as a NATO base, including security hardening and an armory, as well as an Italian security detail stationed nearby.\n\n===Exxon Valdez oil spill===\nIn March 1989, the oil tanker ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' struck [[Prince William Sound]]'s [[Bligh Reef]] and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels (41,000 to 119,000 m3) of crude oil. Because the incident took place in navigational waters, the Coast Guard had authority for all activities relating to the cleanup effort. The Coast Guard largely served as the [[Federal On Scene Coordinator|Federal On-Scene Coordinator]] between [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]] and all of these organizations, acting within authority under the [[Clean Water Act]].\n\nCoast Guard cutters were one of the first to respond to the spill, quickly establishing a safety zone around the stricken ''Exxon Valdez''. At least eleven cutters were present in April 1989, the majority of them overseeing booming and skimming operations. Early that month, Coast Guard vessel activity went through a rapid buildup phase. The Coast Guard maintained a heavy cutter presence for two weeks in mid-April and then reduced it towards the end of the month. Four or five cutters were on hand in early May and that number was reduced to two or three by the end of the month. Three cutters were assigned to cleanup operations by the beginning of June, but only one remained two weeks later \u2013 and it stayed that way for the remainder of the 1989 response.\n\nSeveral [[C-130]]s from [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak]] airlifted more than 11 \u00bc tons of cleanup equipment by 10 April 1989. [[Dassault Falcon 20|HU-25 Falcon]] jets from [[Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod]] flew twice a day tracking oil with side-looking radar equipment. Five Coast Guard helicopters also assisted thirty-nine skimmers working in Prince William Sound.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/EV.pdf]\n\n==The 1990s==\n\n==='90 Operation Desert Shield===\n[[File:Harbor patrol during Operation Desert Shield.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Members of Port Security Unit 302 patrol the harbor aboard a Navy harbor patrol boat during Operation Desert Shield.]]\nOn 17 August 1990, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary of Transportation and the Commandant of the Coast Guard committed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) to [[Operation Desert Shield]].  A total of 10 four-person teams served in-theater to support the enforcement of UN sanctions by the Maritime Interdiction Forces.  Approximately 60 percent of the 600 boardings carried out by U.S. forces were either led by or supported with the LEDETs.  Additionally, a 7-man liaison staff was designated by the Commandant as Operational Commander for the Coast Guard forces deployed in theater.  The first boarding of an Iraqi vessel in the theater of operations conducted by a LEDET occurred on 30 August 1990. President George H. W. Bush, on 22 August 1990, authorized the call up of members of the selected reserve to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield.  Three Port Security Units (PSU), consisting of 550 Coast Guard reservists are ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. This was the first involuntary overseas mobilization of Coast Guard Reserve PSUs in the Coast Guard Reserve's 50-year history.  A total of 950 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\">http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/PersianGulfChron.asp</ref>\n\n==='91 Operation Desert Storm===\nPrior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, Coast Guard LEDET personnel aboard the {{USS|Nicholas|FFG-47|}} assisted when the frigate cleared eleven Iraqi oil platforms and took 23 prisoners on 18 January 1991.  On 21 April 1991, a Tactical Port Security Boat (TPSB) of PSU 301, stationed in [[Al Jubayl]], Saudi Arabia, was the first boat in the newly reopened harbor of [[Mina Ash Shuwaikh]] in Kuwait City.  Because of certain security concerns, a determination was made to send one of the 22-foot Raider boats belonging to PSU 301 and armed with [[M2 machine gun|M2]] and [[M60 machine gun]]s, to lead the procession into the harbor and provide security for the operation.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/>\n\nDuring the war, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army was seeking to pollute the Persian Gulf by pouring oil into in an effort only partly stymied when Air Force F-111F Aardvarks bombed the source of the deliberate spill. A giant slick was spreading rapidly, wreaking environmental havoc and threatening Saudi desalinization plants that supplied potable water for coalition troops. Two HU-25B Guardians from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., were dispatched 13 Feb 1991, supported by two HC-130H Hercules from CGAS Clearwater Florida, Operating from Saudi and Bahraini airfields. The HC-130s brought in supplies and returned to the United States 25 Feb.. The HU-25Bs flew over the oil spill to monitor dispersion, rate of flow, the effects of weather and currents, and other data essential for preparing a response plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/gulf-war-20th-coast-guard-aviators-battled-saddam-husseins-oil-spill/|title=Gulf War 20th: Coast Guard Aviators Battled Saddam Hussein's Oil Spill \u2013 Defense Media Network|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Buckshot, \"The Great Flood of '93\"===\nDuring April and again in June 1993, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis (CGF)was activated for flooding on the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois River basins. The '500 year' flooding closed over {{convert|1250|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of river to navigation and claimed 47 lives. Historic levels of rainfall in the river tributaries caused many levee breaks along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers displacing thousands of people from their homes and businesses. The commander of CGF St. Louis set into motion a preconceived operations plan to deal with the many requests for assistance from state and local governments for law enforcement assistance, help with sandbagging, water rescues, evacuation of flood victims, and aerial surveillance of levee conditions. The unprecedented duration of the flood also caused Coast Guard personnel to assume some humanitarian services not normally a part of flood operations. Food, water and sandbags were transported to work sites to assist sandbagging efforts by local governments. Red Cross and Salvation Army relief workers were given transportation assistance. Many homeless animals displaced by the flood waters were rescued and turned over to local animal shelters. Utility repair crews were assisted with transportation of personnel and repair parts. Disaster Response Units (DRU) were formed from active duty and reserve units throughout the Second Coast Guard District and consisted of eight members equipped with three 16-foot flood punts powered by 25 horsepower outboard motors. The DRU's accounted for 1517 boat sorties and 3342 hours of underway operations. Coast Guard helicopters from CG Air Stations in Traverse City and Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Elizabeth City, North Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama provided search and rescue, logistical support and aerial survey intelligence. The Coast Guard Auxiliary provided three fixed wing aircraft. There were 473 aircraft sorties with 570 hours of aircraft operations. CGF St. Louis stood down from the alert phase of operations on 27 August. A total of 380 Active Duty, 352 Reserve, 179 Auxiliary, and 5 Coast Guard civilians were involved in the operation.<ref>After Action Report for Operation Buckshot, Commander, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis, 2nd Coast Guard District, 15 August 1993</ref>\n\n===1994 Cuban boat rescues===\n[[File:USCGC Tamaroa WUEC-166 1990.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[USCGC Tamaroa|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']] (WMEC-166), best known for her rescues during the \"[[1991 Halloween Nor'easter|Perfect Storm]]\" of 1991.]]\nIn 1994, about 38,000 Cubans attempted to sail from Cuba to Florida, many on homemade rafts.  The Coast Guard and Navy performed intensive search and rescue efforts to rescue rafters at sea. Sixteen 110-foot (34 m) cutters\u2014half the complement of the Coast Guard\u2014were involved in this operation, as well as buoy tenders not normally assigned to high seas duty. Due to a change in Presidential policy, rescued Cubans were sent to the U.S. Naval Station at [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba.\n\n===1999 Kosovo===\nIn the summer of 1999, {{USCGC|Bear|WMEC-901}} deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of [[Operation Allied Force]] and [[Operation Noble Anvil]] with the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}} Battle Group providing surface surveillance and SAR response for the Sea Combat Commander, and force protection for the Amphibious Ready Group operating near Albania. The ''Bear'' also provided security to the US Army vessels transporting military cargo between Italy and Albania. This escort operation took ''Bear'' up to the Albanian coastline, well within enemy surface-to-surface missile range. ''Bear'' earned the [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]] and the [[NATO Kosovo Medal]].[http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/KosovoBear.pdf]\n\n==The 2000s==\n:''For details on the Coast Guard's response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], see [[Missions of the United States Coast Guard]] above.''\n\n===Transfer to the Department of Homeland Security===\nThe Coast Guard was transferred from the Department of Transportation to the [[Department of Homeland Security]] on 1 March 2003 under the [[Homeland Security Act]] (Public Law No. 107-296).\n\nIn 2002, the Coast Guard sent several 110-foot (34 m) cutters to the [[Persian Gulf]] to enforce the U.N. embargo on goods to and from [[Iraq]].

The crews also assessed storm damage to offshore oil platforms and refineries.  More than 2,400 personnel from all districts conducted search, rescue, response, waterway reconstitution and environmental impact assessment operations. In total, the Coast Guard air and boat rescued more than 33,500 people and assisted with the joint-agency evacuation of an additional 9,400 patients and medical personnel from hospitals in the Gulf coast region.\n\nIn May 2006, at the Change of Command ceremony when Admiral [[Thad Allen]] took over as Commandant, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W.

Although the program involves obtaining new ships and aircraft, Deepwater also involves upgraded information technology for command, control, communications and computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR).\n\nA key part of the Deepwater system is the Maritime Security Cutter, Large (WMSL), which is designed to replace the 378-foot (115 m) high-endurance cutters currently on duty.  This ship will have a length of 421 feet (128 m), be powered by a [[gas turbine]] engine with two auxiliary [[diesel engine]]s, and be capable of 12,000 nautical mile (22,000&nbsp;km) voyages lasting up to 60 days.  The keel laying of the {{USCGC|Bertholf}} (WMSL-750), the first ship in this class, took place in September 2004. The ship was delivered in 2008. The second keel, {{USCGC|Waesche|WMSL-751}}, was laid in 2005.\n\nAnother key vessel is the Maritime Security Cutter, Medium (WMSM), which will be 341&nbsp;ft (104 m) long, displace 2,921 long tons (2,968 metric tons), and be capable of 45-day patrols of up to 9,000 nautical miles (17,000&nbsp;km).
