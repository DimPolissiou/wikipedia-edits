Chander goes to Bombay to search for Lata. Chander's rich friend Parkash opens a musical instruments shop for Chander, where Chander can earn his livelihood by repairing musical instruments. Parkash's mother doesn't like Parkash spending money for Chander. Lata has become a writer, her work is published under the nickname of \"Renu\" aka \"Renuka Devi\"; Chander becomes a fan of her work. Basanti is Lata's friend. In one of her novels, Lata writes the story of the Childhood friendship of Chander and Lata. Chander reads it and writes a letter to Renu (Lata) to find out how she knows of this story and if she knows Lata, then she can help him find Lata. Reading that letter, Basanti forces Lata to call Chander to meet, plotting that Basanti will meet Chander as well as Lata. Basanti meets Chander there and falls in love with Chander. Chander was carrying the watch gifted by Lata to him all the time, which he loses when Basanti meets him and Basanti locates it. Seeing the watch, Lata recognizes it and recognizes Chander. Basanti feels hurt and blames Lata that she had known that Basanti was in love with Chander, and even then Lata didn't tell her that Chander is the same guy who Lata herself was in love with. Lata later tells her that she herself was not aware of it.\n\nLata's parents contact Parkash for marrying Lata. When Chander comes to know of it, under the lifetime of obligations to Parkash, he sacrifices his love for Lata in favor of Parkash. Chander's mother dies.

Representative offices were established in [[Beijing]] (1982), [[Chicago]] (branch 1982), [[Dallas]] (1983), [[Seoul]] (1983, upgraded to a branch in 1990), [[San Francisco]] (1984), [[Kuala Lumpur]] (1984), [[Athens]] (1984, closed 1989), [[Frankfurt]] (1985, closed 1992), [[Atlanta]] (1986), Bangkok (1986), [[Taipei]] (1986 upgraded to branch 1990), [[Shanghai]] (1988, closed 1990), [[Houston]] (1989) and [[New Delhi]] (1989).\n\nIn 1987, NAB bought [[Clydesdale Bank]] ([[Scotland]]) and [[Northern Bank]] ([[Northern Ireland]] and [[Republic of Ireland]]) from [[Midland Bank]]. It rebranded Northern Bank branches in the Republic of Ireland to [[National Irish Bank]] and changed both banks' logos from that of the Midland Bank. In 1990, NAB bought [[Yorkshire Bank]] ([[England and Wales]]).\n\nFurther acquisitions followed \u2013 [[Bank of New Zealand]] in 1992, which at the time had about a 26% market share in the New Zealand market, and [[Michigan National Bank]] (MNB) in 1995. NAB had earlier rationalised its operations in the US and closed its offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, and San Francisco in 1991.\n\nThis period of rapid expansion through acquisition concluded with the purchases in 1997 of HomeSide Lending, a leading US mortgage originator and servicer based in [[Florida]], and most significantly, the acquisition in 2000 of [[MLC Limited]] (and related MLC entities) for $4.56bn, one of the biggest mergers in Australian corporate history.\n\nNAB encountered a difficult period in the period 2000\u20132005.

The losses were a result of a failed speculative position where the traders falsified profits to trigger bonuses over a number of years.

In total, NAB booked $2.2 billion in losses due to HomeSide.\n\nAs a result of all these events, NAB's Australian shareholders attempted to sue it in the United States for [[securities fraud]], even though the plaintiffs, the defendant, and the actual securities at issue (NAB's shares) were all located in Australia.  (The main advantage of suing in the U.S. arises from ''[[Basic Inc. v. Levinson]]'' (1988), under which it is presumed that the defendant committed \"fraud-on-the-market\" unless the defendant proves otherwise.)  The case of ''[[Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd]]'' ultimately ended up before the U.S. Supreme Court, which held in a unanimous 8\u20130 decision on 24 June 2010 that U.S. law against securities fraud does not apply to securities deals occurring outside of the country.\n\n===Financed fossil fuel businesses===\nIt has been estimated that since 2008, NAB has loaned A$11.2 billion to the [[fossil fuel]] industry in Australia, positioning itself as the 3rd largest lender in this regard.

Investigations by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] and the [[Australian Prudential Regulation Authority]] highlighted a need for cultural change. The losses were a result of a failed speculative position where the traders falsified profits to trigger bonuses over a number of years. In order to actually generate the reported profits, the traders speculated on the US dollar, betting that it would rise against the Australian dollar and other currencies.\nIn 2006, two former NAB foreign currency options traders were sentenced on charges brought by the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] (ASIC) and incurred jail terms.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byheadline/06-221+Former+NAB+foreign+currency+options+traders+sentenced?openDocument|title= Former NAB foreign currency options traders sentenced|date= 4 July 2006|publisher= Australian Securities and Investments Commission|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000543/http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byheadline/06-221+Former+NAB+foreign+currency+options+traders+sentenced?openDocument|archivedate= 28 September 2007|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Financial planner misconduct===\nActing on a customer complaint, an Australian Securities & Investment Commission (ASIC) investigation found that between 1997 and 2001, a NAB financial products seller, Paul Drakos, working out of a northern Sydney branch at Hornsby made recommendations to a number of NAB clients, mostly retirees, to invest in BSI Corp,<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bsibank.com/en/Group-sites/Trust-Bahamas.html|title= BSI Corp website|date=February 2014|publisher=BSI Corp.}}</ref> an entity based in the Bahamas which was not a NAB approved investment product.

First, in July 2001, NAB had a $450 million write down of the value of its capitalised mortgage servicing rights (CMSRs) during the quarter ending 30 June 2001, and was the result of exceptionally high mortgage refinance volumes which lowered the value of the CMSRs, combined with a more challenging capital markets environment in which to hedge interest rate risk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1191|title=Morrison v.

In total, NAB booked $2.2 billion in losses due to HomeSide.\n\nAs a result of all these events, NAB's Australian shareholders attempted to sue it in the United States for [[securities fraud]], even though the plaintiffs, the defendant, and the actual securities at issue (NAB's shares) were all located in Australia.  (The main advantage of suing in the U.S. arises from ''[[Basic Inc. v. Levinson]]'' (1988), under which it is presumed that the defendant committed \"fraud-on-the-market\" unless the defendant proves otherwise.)  The case of ''[[Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd]]'' ultimately ended up before the U.S. Supreme Court, which held in a unanimous 8\u20130 decision on 24 June 2010 that U.S. law against securities fraud does not apply to securities deals occurring outside of the country.\n\n===Financed fossil fuel businesses===\nIt has been estimated that since 2008, NAB has loaned A$11.2 billion to the [[fossil fuel]] industry in Australia, positioning itself as the 3rd largest lender in this regard.

It is built using a fairly traditional style, similar to that of an acoustic guitar. It commonly features a thin [[maple]] body, a [[spruce]] top and a maple neck. The fretboard is traditionally made of [[rosewood]], though more contemporary models have utilized other, similar tonewoods. The H\u00f6fner 500 features a two-piece [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] system, consisting of an adjustable [[ebony]] bridge, and a metal tailpiece. The H\u00f6fner 500 is also notable for its distinctive control layout, featuring two rotary knobs, as well as three sliding knobs, controlling tone and pickup selection. \n\nEarlier models, as well as certain reissues featured the two pickups spaced closely together, up against the heel of the neck, providing a fairly uniform tone, though most recent basses feature a more conventional \"bridge/neck\" pickup placement. The earlier models are often referred to as \"Cavern basses\", after the [[Cavern club]], where Paul McCartney famously made use of this particular model.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I remember going along there, and there was this bass which was quite cheap. I couldn't afford a [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]. Fenders even then seemed to be about \u00a3100. All I could really afford was about \u00a330 ... so for about \u00a330, I found this Hofner violin bass. And to me, it seemed like, because I was left-handed, it looked less daft because it was symmetrical. Didn't look as bad as a cutaway which was the wrong way.

In 1964, he had his 1961 model refinished in sunburst and had a new updated pickup surround system installed around the original pickups, as one of the plastic original surrounds had snapped (the one nearest the neck). He can be seen using this bass in the \"[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]\" promo video, strangely with the strap attached to the top of the headstock instead of the neck heel strap button. He continued to regularly use the violin bass until 1965 when he switched to a [[Rickenbacker 4001S]]; afterwards, he would rotate between the two. On 30 January 1969 the Hofner Bass made its last Beatle appearance at the Apple rooftop concert. Sometime during the recording of ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'', the 1961 model was stolen from [[Abbey Road Studios]] closet, along with [[George Harrison]]'s Gretsch Tennessean and [[Rickenbacker 360/12]].<ref>{{cite web |last= Crowley |first= John F. |title= McCartney's Guitars, Part 3 |publisher= The Canteen |date= |url= http://www.thecanteen.com/mccartney3.html |accessdate= March 27, 2019}}</ref> McCartney switched to using his 1963 model for the remainder of the album.<ref>\"Let It Be\" film, Apple Corps.</ref> He switched back to the Rickenbacker for the recording of ''[[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]]'' and he even used it with [[Wings (band)|Wings]] and his solo career.

In July 1961, before [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] decided to leave the Beatles, he briefly lent McCartney his bass guitar until the latter could earn enough to buy a  [[H\u00f6fner 500/1]] bass guitar of his own in June 1961.<ref>{{cite book |last=Miles |first=Barry |authorlink=Barry Miles |title=[[Many Years From Now]] |publisher=[[Vintage (publisher)|Vintage]]-[[Random House]] |year=1997|pages= 74-75 |isbn=978-0-7493-8658-0}}</ref> McCartney was drawn to the H\u00f6fner because he felt that its [[symmetry|symmetrical]] shape would mean that playing it left-handed would not look as awkward as using a [[cutaway (guitar)|cutaway]] guitar designed for a right-handed player:<ref name=Burrows1>{{cite book |last= Terry |first= Burrows (ed.) |title= 1001 Guitars to Dream of Playing Before You Die |location= Sydney |publisher= Pier 9 |date= 2013 |pages= 178 |format= |isbn= 978-1-7433-6912-8}}</ref> Following the popularity of the Violin Bass created by McCartney, H\u00f6fner began producing a similar alternative in terms of sound and size with a different shaped body called the [[H\u00f6fner 500/2|H\u00f6fner 500/2 Club Bass]] in 1964.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hofner Club Bass |url=https://www.hofner-guitars.com/guitars-basses/electric-basses/club-bass.html |website=Hofner |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe H\u00f6fner 500 is a hollow-body instrument, though lacking soundholes, and is as such commonly referred to as a semi-hollow guitar. It is built using a fairly traditional style, similar to that of an acoustic guitar. It commonly features a thin [[maple]] body, a [[spruce]] top and a maple neck. The fretboard is traditionally made of [[rosewood]], though more contemporary models have utilized other, similar tonewoods. The H\u00f6fner 500 features a two-piece [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] system, consisting of an adjustable [[ebony]] bridge, and a metal tailpiece. The H\u00f6fner 500 is also notable for its distinctive control layout, featuring two rotary knobs, as well as three sliding knobs, controlling tone and pickup selection. \n\nEarlier models, as well as certain reissues featured the two pickups spaced closely together, up against the heel of the neck, providing a fairly uniform tone, though most recent basses feature a more conventional \"bridge/neck\" pickup placement. The earlier models are often referred to as \"Cavern basses\", after the [[Cavern club]], where Paul McCartney famously made use of this particular model.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I remember going along there, and there was this bass which was quite cheap. I couldn't afford a [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]. Fenders even then seemed to be about \u00a3100. All I could really afford was about \u00a330 ... so for about \u00a330, I found this Hofner violin bass.

In 1964, he had his 1961 model refinished in sunburst and had a new updated pickup surround system installed around the original pickups, as one of the plastic original surrounds had snapped (the one nearest the neck). He can be seen using this bass in the \"[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]\" promo video, strangely with the strap attached to the top of the headstock instead of the neck heel strap button. He continued to regularly use the violin bass until 1965 when he switched to a [[Rickenbacker 4001S]]; afterwards, he would rotate between the two. On 30 January 1969 the Hofner Bass made its last Beatle appearance at the Apple rooftop concert. Sometime during the recording of ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'', the 1961 model was stolen from [[Abbey Road Studios]] closet, along with [[George Harrison]]'s Gretsch Tennessean and [[Rickenbacker 360/12]].<ref>{{cite web |last= Crowley |first= John F. |title= McCartney's Guitars, Part 3 |publisher= The Canteen |date= |url= http://www.thecanteen.com/mccartney3.html |accessdate= March 27, 2019}}</ref> McCartney switched to using his 1963 model for the remainder of the album.<ref>\"Let It Be\" film, Apple Corps.</ref> He switched back to the Rickenbacker for the recording of ''[[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]]'' and he even used it with [[Wings (band)|Wings]] and his solo career.

Additionally, identifiers cannot remain static otherwise malicious third parties can observe identifiers over time across a wide area and identify patterns of movement for individual clients on the network.\n\n=== Ephemeral ID ===\nThe majority of protocols make use of Ephemeral IDs, which are strings used to identify clients for a short period of time. While not unique for every encounter, ephemeral IDs make it extremely difficult to track individuals over a period of time longer than the lifetime of the ID. When used in a centralized model, such as BlueTrace, Ephemeral IDs are typically the static user identifier and other data encrypted by a key known only to the server. In a decentralized model they are usually pseudo-randomly generated using a seed known only to the client.\n\n=== Unique ID ===\nUnique ID protocols generate a new identifier for every encounter. Currently the only protocol using this method is the TCN Protocol. The largest issue with using unique IDs for every encounter is that reports can quickly become extremely large, which, when used in combination with a decentralized model, could lead to extremely large download sizes for clients retrieving reports. TCN overcame this obstacle by instead successively and deterministically generating each new unique ID from the previous. Then, when a report needed to be upload, only the first entry within the report time period was submitted and clients would calculate the rest of the entries locally.\n\n== List of protocols ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Name\n!Methodology\n!Architecture\n!Author/promoter\n!Licence\n!Homepage\n!Ref\n|-\n|<!-- Name     -->[[Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing]] (PEPP-PT) project\n|Bluetooth LE\n|Central log processing, Ephemeral IDs\n|<!-- Author   -->[[Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications]], [[Robert Koch Institute]], [[Technical University of Berlin]], [[TU Dresden]], [[University of Erfurt]], [[Vodafone Germany]]\n|<!-- Licence  -->multiple protocols, closed source, private specifications\n|<!-- Homepage -->https://www.pepp-pt.org/\n|<!-- Ref      --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/an-eu-coalition-of-techies-is-backing-a-privacy-preserving-standard-for-covid-19-contacts-tracing/|title=An EU coalition of techies is backing a \u2018privacy-preserving\u2019 standard for COVID-19 contacts tracing|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n|-\n|<!-- Name     -->[[Google / Apple privacy-preserving tracing project]]\n|Bluetooth LE\n|Client log processing, Ephemeral IDs\n|<!-- Author   -->[[Google]], [[Apple Inc.]]\n|<!-- Licence  -->public specification\n|<!-- Homepage -->https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing\n|<!-- Ref      --><ref name=\"Sam Schechner and Rolfe Winkler\">{{Cite news|last=Sam Schechner and Rolfe Winkler|first=|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/heres-how-apple-and-google-plan-to-track-the-coronavirus-through-your-phone-11586618075|title=Here\u2019s How Apple and Google Plan to Track the Coronavirus Through Your Phone|date=2020-04-11|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2020-04-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n|<!-- Name     -->[[Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing]] (DP-3T)\n|Bluetooth LE\n|Client log processing,\nEphemeral IDs\n|<!-- Author   -->[[\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne|EPFL]], [[ETH Zurich|ETHZ]], [[KU Leuven]], [[Delft University of Technology|TU Delft,]] [[University College London]], [[CISPA]], [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Turin|University of Torino]] / [[ISI Foundation]]\n|<!-- Licence  -->publicly-developed [[Apache 2.0]] reference implementation, [[Mozilla Public License|MPL 2.0]] iOS/Android code.<br />\n|<!-- Homepage -->https://github.com/DP-3T\n|<!-- Ref      --><ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/call-for-common-eu-approach-to-apps-and-data-to-fight-covid-19-and-protect-citizens-rights/|title=Call for common EU approach to apps and data to fight COVID-19 and protect citizens\u2019 rights|date=2020-04-08|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n|-\n|<!-- Name     -->[[BlueTrace]] / [[OpenTrace]]\n|Bluetooth LE\n|Central log processing,\nEphemeral IDs\n|<!-- Author   -->[[Singapore Government Digital Services]]\n|<!-- Licence  -->public specification, [[GPL 3]] code\n|<!-- Homepage -->[https://bluetrace.io bluetrace.io]\n|<!-- Ref      --><ref name=\"computerweekly.com\" />\n|-\n|<!-- Name     -->[[TCN Coalition]] / [[TCN Protocol]]\n|Bluetooth LE\n|Client log processing,\nUnique IDs\n|<!-- Author   -->[[CovidWatch]], [[CoEpi]], ITO, Commons Project, [[Zcash]] Foundation, [[Openmined]]\n|<!-- Licence  -->public developed specification, [[MIT License]] code\n|<!-- Homepage -->[https://tcn-coalition.org tcn-coalition.org   https://github.com/TCNCoalition/TCN]\n|<!-- Ref      --><ref name=\"Sam Schechner and Rolfe Winkler\" />\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[COVID-19 apps]]\n\n== References ==\n\n[[Category:Software associated with the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:Digital contact tracing protocols]]\n[[Category:Bluetooth software]]\n[[Category:Mass surveillance]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:A schematic of app-based COVID-19 contact tracing (Fig. 4 from Ferretti et al. 2020).jpg|thumb|350px|Example proposal for a location-based COVID-19 contact tracing app: Contacts of individual A (and all individuals using the app) are traced using GPS co-localisations with other app users, supplemented by scanning [[QR codes]] displayed on high-traffic public amenities where GPS is too coarse.

Additionally, identifiers cannot remain static otherwise malicious third parties can observe identifiers over time across a wide area and identify patterns of movement for individual clients on the network.\n\n=== Ephemeral ID ===\nThe majority of protocols make use of Ephemeral IDs, which are strings used to identify clients for a short period of time. While not unique for every encounter, ephemeral IDs make it extremely difficult to track individuals over a period of time longer than the lifetime of the ID. When used in a centralized model, such as BlueTrace, Ephemeral IDs are typically the static user identifier and other data encrypted by a key known only to the server. In a decentralized model they are usually pseudo-randomly generated using a seed known only to the client.\n\n=== Unique ID ===\nUnique ID protocols generate a new identifier for every encounter. Currently the only protocol using this method is the TCN Protocol. The largest issue with using unique IDs for every encounter is that reports can quickly become extremely large, which, when used in combination with a decentralized model, could lead to extremely large download sizes for clients retrieving reports. TCN overcame this obstacle by instead successively and deterministically generating each new unique ID from the previous. Then, when a report needed to be upload, only the first entry within the report time period was submitted and clients would calculate the rest of the entries locally.\n\n== List of protocols ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Name\n!Methodology\n!Architecture\n!Author/promoter\n!Licence\n!Homepage\n!Ref\n|-\n|<!-- Name     -->[[Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing]] (PEPP-PT) project\n|Bluetooth LE\n|Central log processing, Ephemeral IDs\n|<!-- Author   -->[[Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications]], [[Robert Koch Institute]], [[Technical University of Berlin]], [[TU Dresden]], [[University of Erfurt]], [[Vodafone Germany]]\n|<!-- Licence  -->multiple protocols, closed source, private specifications\n|<!-- Homepage -->https://www.pepp-pt.org/\n|<!-- Ref      --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/an-eu-coalition-of-techies-is-backing-a-privacy-preserving-standard-for-covid-19-contacts-tracing/|title=An EU coalition of techies is backing a \u2018privacy-preserving\u2019 standard for COVID-19 contacts tracing|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n|-\n|<!-- Name     -->[[Google / Apple privacy-preserving tracing project]]\n|Bluetooth LE\n|Client log processing, Ephemeral IDs\n|<!-- Author   -->[[Google]], [[Apple Inc.]]\n|<!-- Licence  -->public specification\n|<!-- Homepage -->https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing\n|<!-- Ref      --><ref name=\"Sam Schechner and Rolfe Winkler\">{{Cite news|last=Sam Schechner and Rolfe Winkler|first=|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/heres-how-apple-and-google-plan-to-track-the-coronavirus-through-your-phone-11586618075|title=Here\u2019s How Apple and Google Plan to Track the Coronavirus Through Your Phone|date=2020-04-11|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2020-04-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n|<!-- Name     -->[[Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing]] (DP-3T)\n|Bluetooth LE\n|Client log processing,\nEphemeral IDs\n|<!-- Author   -->[[\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne|EPFL]], [[ETH Zurich|ETHZ]], [[KU Leuven]], [[Delft University of Technology|TU Delft,]] [[University College London]], [[CISPA]], [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Turin|University of Torino]] / [[ISI Foundation]]\n|<!-- Licence  -->publicly-developed [[Apache 2.0]] reference implementation, [[Mozilla Public License|MPL 2.0]] iOS/Android code.<br />\n|<!-- Homepage -->https://github.com/DP-3T\n|<!-- Ref      --><ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/call-for-common-eu-approach-to-apps-and-data-to-fight-covid-19-and-protect-citizens-rights/|title=Call for common EU approach to apps and data to fight COVID-19 and protect citizens\u2019 rights|date=2020-04-08|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n|-\n|<!-- Name     -->[[BlueTrace]] / [[OpenTrace]]\n|Bluetooth LE\n|Central log processing,\nEphemeral IDs\n|<!-- Author   -->[[Singapore Government Digital Services]]\n|<!-- Licence  -->public specification, [[GPL 3]] code\n|<!-- Homepage -->[https://bluetrace.io bluetrace.io]\n|<!-- Ref      --><ref name=\"computerweekly.com\" />\n|-\n|<!-- Name     -->[[TCN Coalition]] / [[TCN Protocol]]\n|Bluetooth LE\n|Client log processing,\nUnique IDs\n|<!-- Author   -->[[CovidWatch]], [[CoEpi]], ITO, Commons Project, [[Zcash]] Foundation, [[Openmined]]\n|<!-- Licence  -->public developed specification, [[MIT License]] code\n|<!-- Homepage -->[https://tcn-coalition.org tcn-coalition.org   https://github.com/TCNCoalition/TCN]\n|<!-- Ref      --><ref name=\"Sam Schechner and Rolfe Winkler\" />\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[COVID-19 apps]]\n\n== References ==\n\n[[Category:Software associated with the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:Digital contact tracing protocols]]\n[[Category:Bluetooth software]]\n[[Category:Mass surveillance]]\n", "name_user": "Bravetheif", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:Wording", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_contact_tracing"}

In other words, life is delicate and should be lived with caution and with an emphasis on diplomacy, consideration, respect and harmony.<ref name=Lawal />\n\n==The origins of Gelede==\nMost Yoruba myths of origin can be found in the divination narratives knows at [[Odu Ifa]]. There are approximately 256 Odu Ifa, each of which contains a number of poems called ese Ifa. A typical ese Ifa is a narrative about a person or animal with a problem and the steps to resolve that problem. An ese Ifa explains the origins of Gelede as beginning with [[Yemoja]], \"The Mother of all the orisa and all living things.\" Yemoja could not have children and consulted an Ifa oracle, who advised her to offer sacrifices and to dance with wooden images on her head and metal anklets on her feet. After performing this ritual, she became pregnant. Her first child was a boy, nicknamed \"Efe\" (the humorist); the Efe mask emphasizes song and jests because of the personality of its namesake. Yemoja's second child was a girl, nicknamed \"Gelede\" because she was obese like her mother. Also like her mother, Gelede loved dancing.\n\nAfter getting married themselves, neither Gelede or Efe's partner could have children. The Ifa oracle suggested they try the same ritual that had worked for their mother. No sooner than Efe and Gelede performed these rituals - dancing with wooden images on their heads and metal anklets on their feet - they started having children. These rituals developed into the Gelede masked dance and was perpetuated by the descendants of Efe and Gelede.<ref name=Lawal />\n\nThis narrative is one of many stories that explains the origin of Gelede. Another theory states that the beginning of Gelede might be associated with the change from a [[matriarchal]] to a [[patriarchal]] society.<ref name=Lawal />\n\n== The Gelede Society ==\nThe Gelede festival promotes social harmony, because of this both men and women are involved within the society. With its connection to [[Iya Nla]], or the Great Mother, the Gelede society has a large amount of female members. This is in part because of its connection to motherhood and mothers, but also due to the belief that participation within this society helps in the fertility of the women. Men's participation within the masking performances are similarly linked, as participating in the performances could also increase fertility. Though men are not as concerned with this issue as women are due to the nature of the Yoruba society and women's roles within it.<ref name=\"Lawal\" />\n\nTo be able to perform the various events within the Gelede festival, the Gelede society appoints officials, groups, and professionals to oversee various aspects within the society. Though the titles of these various groups and people vary from community to community the following are the most common:\n\nIyalase, the Chief Priestess, meaning \"mother of the shrine\"<ref name=\"Lawal\" /> is the head of this Gelede society. She is the main person of communication between Iya Nla, the community, and the Gelde Society. Iyalase's main function, outside of a point of communication, is being in charge of the Gelede shrine, Ase, where she is the only one allowed to enter. \n\nBabalase, the Chief Priest, meaning \"father of the shrine\"<ref name=\"Lawal\" /> is the male equivalent of Iyalase. His main function within the Gelede society is the organization of the events for the Gelede festival. In line with being the organizer of the Gelede events, he is the official keeper of the Gelede headdresses and costumes. The Babalase is, in the most general terms, the assistant to Iyalase where he will only be appointed with the approval of Iya Nla and the powerful mothers. \n\nAbore, or the Male Priest, is an older male official that assists people looking for favors form the aje for their rituals. In some communities this position is hereditary and requires a vast amount of knowledge about rituals and worship in the Yoruba society. \n\nElefe, or the Humorist, is the man who carries the Efe mask for the Gelede festival. It is his job to pray for the well-being of the community and promote non antisocial behaviors while also being the voice of the community. Saying and doing things that outside of this individual would be socially unacceptable. Usually played by a middle aged man or older, it is essential that he is knowledgeable in the oral literature of the community, \n\nArugi, or the masker, means \"wood carrier\"<ref name=\"Lawal\" />. This man must not only be a good dancer but also must be knowledgeable in the popular proverbs and local language to orient himself and understand the language of the drums. The learning of this language usually begins sometime in early childhood when children start learning the various dances. If they appear to have skill those children are then trained and allowed to wear the masks during the annual Gelede festival. \n\nOnilu, or the Drummers, in the case of Gelede are experts in the music of Gelede. Agberin, or the Chorus, is composed of men and women wearing either similar or the same clothing to project the appearance of being a group.<ref name=\"Lawal\" />\n\n==Gelede spectacle==\nAlthough the Gelede ceremony may be staged at any time of the year (to better the lot of an individual, to cleanse the society of pestilence, to induce rain, to enrich human fertility, to enlist the support of supernatural forces and the \"powerful mothers\" in wartime, and to honor the dead), the most elaborate performance occurs during the annual festival. Sponsorship plays a big role in the size and elaborateness of these performances. The larger the performance the more likely to be sponsored by the community instead of an individual or family, which tends to be smaller. <ref name=\"Lawal\" /> The annual Gelede festival is usually sponsored by the community so it tends to be larger. \n\nOnce the exact dates of the festival are fixed, usually through divination, the Iyalase notifies the paramount chief of the community and the important subordinate chiefs. Messages then go out to all members of the Gelede society outside the town or working far away to return home for the celebration.\n\nThe festival begins with an all-night concert called efe, which features the Efe male mask, who uses satire to entertain and educate. Given the concern of the Gelede society with peace and social stability, it is not surprising that didactic themes recur in ''efe'' songs.\n\nAfter the efe dance, most of the attendees spend the morning sleeping in preparation for the afternoon dance, which takes place in the marketplace and features pairs of male dancers who perform to fast-paced music with a vigorous beat.\n\nThe Gelede ceremony involves carefully choreographed dance, singing and music, and especially drumming. The performances are given by men, wearing masks that feature sculpted images of scenes including animals and people or sewing machines and drums. The pair of men masquerade as women to amuse, please and placate the mothers who are considered very powerful, and who may use their powers for good or destructive purposes. These powers are especially linked to childbirth. The abilities they possess may be activated either consciously or unconsciously.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Birmingham Museum of Art | title = Birmingham Museum of Art: A Guide to the Collection | publisher = Giles | year = 2010 | location = London | page = 71 | url = http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/bmapu.html | accessdate = 2011-07-01 | isbn = 978-1-904832-77-5 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110910171150/http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/bmapu.html | archivedate = 2011-09-10 }}</ref>\n\nThe makers themselves have a hard and complicated job. Having to be trained from an early age, the maskers must be able to match up the sound of their anklets with the sound of the drums while having to be able to anticipate drum solos and the other maskers.<ref name=\"Lawal\" /> \n\n==Gelede costume and headdress==\n\nGelede masks are worn with a costume consisting of layers of elaborate, colorful cloth.\n\nThe Gelede \"mask\" is more accurately a headdress, since it rests on top of the head and the wearer's face is covered by a cloth veil. The headdress takes the form of a human head, on top of which are motifs that are intended to entertain onlookers but, in addition, usually address social concerns that may also be expressed in songs that are part of the masquerade. The headdresses are usually brightly painted.<ref name=Siegmann />\n\nWithin the Gelede festival there are many different headdresses being used. The most common variations being: the Ori Eniyan, or human head. Within this group there are three subcategories. Those that have hairdos, those with head wraps or hats, and those carrying small creatures or objects. This mask is the most commonly associated with the Gelede performances. \n\nThen there is the Iya, or Great Mother head. Igi Efe, or the Efe headress. The Oloju Meji, the double faced mask. Eleru, or head with a superstructure. This headdress has various topics such as the Ritual Bowl Carrier, occupations, religion, portraits, and satire. Followed by the Onidofoyi headdress, or the two human heads connected by snakes mask. The Ori Eye or bird head mask and the Ori Eranko, or the animal head mask.<ref name=\"Lawal\" />\n\nIndividuals or families will usually go to any length to make their headdresses as attractive and humorous as possible. The endless variety of the motifs and their combinations makes it difficult to attempt to construct a typology of Gelede headdresses.<ref name=Lawal />\n\nMost of the headdresses have facial adornments, ranging from lineage marks to decorative tattoos, which are either incised or painted.\n\n[[Babatunde Lawal]] writes: \"The headdress is to the costume what the [[Ase (Yoruba)#The head as the site of ase|head (ori)]] is to the human body. It is an index of identification and the essence of the masker's personality as long as he is inside the mask. In spite of the comical representations that often appear on the headdress, the face below the superstructure remains serene, as if stressing the paradox that is life - and the need to live life with special care.\"<ref name=Lawal />\n\nThe Costumes of the Gelede performance directly relate to the connection of women and motherhood of the society. Consisting of a baby sash, breasts, buttocks, metal anklets, colored panels, a horsetail whisk, and a fan, the materials of the Gelede costumes have various connotations. For example the baby sash represents a breast feeding mother while also being a support within the costume itself. The daytime performances of the Gelede festival are more elaborate and colorful compared to the nighttime performances, with the exception of the Efe costume. This is because during the nighttime performances the costumes are harder to see, so it would be counterproductive to have really elaborate costumes that wouldn't be seen.<ref name=\"Lawal\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Orisa-If\u00e1}}\n{{UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity/AFR}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gelede}}\n[[Category:Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]\n[[Category:Yoruba art]]\n[[Category:Yoruba culture]]\n[[Category:Yoruba religion]]\n[[Category:Nigerian art]]\n[[Category:Masquerade ceremonies in Africa]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orisa-If\u00e1 sidebar|Topics}}\n\n[[File:Masque-costume Gu\u00e8l\u00e8d\u00e8 4-Mus\u00e9e Vodou (1).jpg|thumb|Gelede costume from the Yoruba-Nago of Benin, 2013]]\n[[File:Gelede Mask.jpg|thumb|Gelede mask from the Yoruba people of Nigeria.

After performing this ritual, she became pregnant. Her first child was a boy, nicknamed \"Efe\" (the humorist); the Efe mask emphasizes song and jests because of the personality of its namesake. Yemoja's second child was a girl, nicknamed \"Gelede\" because she was obese like her mother. Also like her mother, Gelede loved dancing.\n\nAfter getting married themselves, neither Gelede or Efe's partner could have children. The Ifa oracle suggested they try the same ritual that had worked for their mother. No sooner than Efe and Gelede performed these rituals - dancing with wooden images on their heads and metal anklets on their feet - they started having children. These rituals developed into the Gelede masked dance and was perpetuated by the descendants of Efe and Gelede.<ref name=Lawal />\n\nThis narrative is one of many stories that explains the origin of Gelede. Another theory states that the beginning of Gelede might be associated with the change from a [[matriarchal]] to a [[patriarchal]] society.<ref name=Lawal />\n\n== The Gelede Society ==\nThe Gelede festival promotes social harmony, because of this both men and women are involved within the society. With its connection to [[Iya Nla]], or the Great Mother, the Gelede society has a large amount of female members. This is in part because of its connection to motherhood and mothers, but also due to the belief that participation within this society helps in the fertility of the women. Men's participation within the masking performances are similarly linked, as participating in the performances could also increase fertility. Though men are not as concerned with this issue as women are due to the nature of the Yoruba society and women's roles within it.<ref name=\"Lawal\" />\n\nTo be able to perform the various events within the Gelede festival, the Gelede society appoints officials, groups, and professionals to oversee various aspects within the society. Though the titles of these various groups and people vary from community to community the following are the most common:\n\nIyalase, the Chief Priestess, meaning \"mother of the shrine\"<ref name=\"Lawal\" /> is the head of this Gelede society. She is the main person of communication between Iya Nla, the community, and the Gelde Society. Iyalase's main function, outside of a point of communication, is being in charge of the Gelede shrine, Ase, where she is the only one allowed to enter. \n\nBabalase, the Chief Priest, meaning \"father of the shrine\"<ref name=\"Lawal\" /> is the male equivalent of Iyalase. His main function within the Gelede society is the organization of the events for the Gelede festival. In line with being the organizer of the Gelede events, he is the official keeper of the Gelede headdresses and costumes. The Babalase is, in the most general terms, the assistant to Iyalase where he will only be appointed with the approval of Iya Nla and the powerful mothers. \n\nAbore, or the Male Priest, is an older male official that assists people looking for favors form the aje for their rituals. In some communities this position is hereditary and requires a vast amount of knowledge about rituals and worship in the Yoruba society. \n\nElefe, or the Humorist, is the man who carries the Efe mask for the Gelede festival. It is his job to pray for the well-being of the community and promote non antisocial behaviors while also being the voice of the community. Saying and doing things that outside of this individual would be socially unacceptable. Usually played by a middle aged man or older, it is essential that he is knowledgeable in the the oral literature of the community, \n\nArugi, or the masker, means \"wood carrier\"<ref name=\"Lawal\" />. This man must not only be a good dancer but also must be knowledgeable in the popular proverbs and local language to orient himself and understand the language of the drums. The learning of this language usually begins sometime in early childhood when children start learning the various dances. If they appear to have skill those children are then trained and allowed to wear the masks during the annual Gelede festival. \n\nOnilu, or the Drummers, in the case of Gelede are experts in the music of Gelede. Agberin, or the Chorus, is composed of men and women wearing either similar or the same clothing to project the appearance of being a group.<ref name=\"Lawal\" />\n\n==Gelede spectacle==\nAlthough the Gelede ceremony may be staged at any time of the year (to better the lot of an individual, to cleanse the society of pestilence, to induce rain, to enrich human fertility, to enlist the support of supernatural forces and the \"powerful mothers\" in wartime, and to honor the dead), the most elaborate performance occurs during the annual festival. Sponsorship plays a big role in the size and elaborateness of these performances. The larger the performance the more likely to be sponsored by the community instead of an individual or family, which tends to be smaller. <ref name=\"Lawal\" /> The annual Gelede festival is usually sponsored by the community so it tends to be larger. \n\nOnce the exact dates of the festival are fixed, usually through divination, the Iyalase notifies the paramount chief of the community and the important subordinate chiefs. Messages then go out to all members of the Gelede society outside the town or working far away to return home for the celebration.\n\nThe festival begins with an all-night concert called efe, which features the Efe male mask, who uses satire to entertain and educate. Given the concern of the Gelede society with peace and social stability, it is not surprising that didactic themes recur in ''efe'' songs.\n\nAfter the efe dance, most of the attendees spend the morning sleeping in preparation for the afternoon dance, which takes place in the marketplace and features pairs of male dancers who perform to fast-paced music with a vigorous beat.\n\nThe Gelede ceremony involves carefully choreographed dance, singing and music, and especially drumming. The performances are given by men, wearing masks that feature sculpted images of scenes including animals and people or sewing machines and drums. The pair of men masquerade as women to amuse, please and placate the mothers who are considered very powerful, and who may use their powers for good or destructive purposes. These powers are especially linked to childbirth. The abilities they possess may be activated either consciously or unconsciously.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Birmingham Museum of Art | title = Birmingham Museum of Art: A Guide to the Collection | publisher = Giles | year = 2010 | location = London | page = 71 | url = http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/bmapu.html | accessdate = 2011-07-01 | isbn = 978-1-904832-77-5 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110910171150/http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/bmapu.html | archivedate = 2011-09-10 }}</ref>\n\nThe makers themselves have a hard and complicated job. Having to be trained from an early age, the maskers must be able to match up the sound of their anklets with the sound of the drums while having to be able to anticipate drum solos and the other maskers.<ref name=\"Lawal\" /> \n\n==Gelede costume and headdress==\n\nGelede masks are worn with a costume consisting of layers of elaborate, colorful cloth.\n\nThe Gelede \"mask\" is more accurately a headdress, since it rests on top of the head and the wearer's face is covered by a cloth veil. The headdress takes the form of a human head, on top of which are motifs that are intended to entertain onlookers but, in addition, usually address social concerns that may also be expressed in songs that are part of the masquerade. The headdresses are usually brightly painted.<ref name=Siegmann />\n\nWithin the Gelede festival there are many different headdresses being used. The most common variations being: the Ori Eniyan, or human head. Within this group there are three subcategories. Those that have hairdos, those with head wraps or hats, and those carrying small creatures or objects. This mask is the most commonly associated with the Gelede performances. \n\nThen there is the Iya, or Great Mother head. Igi Efe, or the Efe headress. The Oloju Meji, the double faced mask. Eleru, or head with a superstructure. This headdress has various topics such as the Ritual Bowl Carrier, occupations, religion, portraits, and satire. Followed by the Onidofoyi headdress, or the two human heads connected by snakes mask. The Ori Eye or bird head mask and the Ori Eranko, or the animal head mask.<ref name=\"Lawal\" />\n\nIndividuals or families will usually go to any length to make their headdresses as attractive and humorous as possible. The endless variety of the motifs and their combinations makes it difficult to attempt to construct a typology of Gelede headdresses.<ref name=Lawal />\n\nMost of the headdresses have facial adornments, ranging from lineage marks to decorative tattoos, which are either incised or painted.\n\n[[Babatunde Lawal]] writes: \"The headdress is to the costume what the [[Ase (Yoruba)#The head as the site of ase|head (ori)]] is to the human body. It is an index of identification and the essence of the masker's personality as long as he is inside the mask. In spite of the comical representations that often appear on the headdress, the face below the superstructure remains serene, as if stressing the paradox that is life - and the need to live life with special care.\"<ref name=Lawal />\n\nThe Costumes of the Gelede performance directly relate to the connection of women and motherhood of the society. Consisting of a baby sash, breasts, buttocks, metal anklets, colored panels, a horsetail whisk, and a fan, the materials of the Gelede costumes have various connotations. For example the baby sash represents a breast feeding mother while also being a support within the costume itself. The daytime performances of the Gelede festival are more elaborate and colorful compared to the nighttime performances, with the exception of the Efe costume. This is because during the nighttime performances the costumes are harder to see, so it would be counterproductive to have really elaborate costumes that wouldn't be seen.<ref name=\"Lawal\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Orisa-If\u00e1}}\n{{UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity/AFR}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gelede}}\n[[Category:Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]\n[[Category:Yoruba art]]\n[[Category:Yoruba culture]]\n[[Category:Yoruba religion]]\n[[Category:Nigerian art]]\n[[Category:Masquerade ceremonies in Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%E1%BA%B9l%E1%BA%B9d%E1%BA%B9"}

The New York Red Bulls took part in the tournament's second edition, starting in the qualifying round against Trinidad and Tobago side [[W Connection]].\n\nThe club's 2009 season was highly disappointing.

On August 21, 2009, Osorio resigned from his position. Assistant [[Richie Williams]] again took over as the club's interim coach. In his second stint as interim, Williams led the Red Bulls to a 3\u20132\u20133 record despite finishing with a league-worst record of 5\u20136\u201319 (21 pts).\n\n=== The Backe era and new stadium (2010\u20132012) ===\n[[File:Thierry Henry control cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thierry Henry]] was one of several high-profile signings by the Red Bulls in 2010]]\n\nThe [[2010 New York Red Bulls season|2010 season]] brought about a new stadium, a new sporting director and coaching staff, and a new group of players to the Red Bulls, who hoped to dramatically improve from their disappointing 2009 season. On January 7, 2010, the Red Bulls confirmed the hiring of veteran Swedish manager [[Hans Backe]] as head coach. Not long after Backe was confirmed as coach, he started to release many players signed by Osorio including [[Jorge Alberto Rojas|Jorge Rojas]], [[Danny Cepero]], [[Carlos Johnson (soccer)|Carlos Johnson]], and [[Walter Garc\u00eda]], while midfielder [[Matthew Mbuta]]'s contract was not picked up for the 2010 season. Under the direction of Backe and newly hired Norwegian sporting director [[Erik Sol\u00e9r]], the club began a new approach of signing veteran European players (mainly from [[Scandinavia]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]]) instead of the South American and Central American players that are usually sought after in MLS. With Backe as head coach, the Red Bulls went undefeated in the 2010 preseason, including the first ever match at [[Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)|Red Bull Arena]] against Santos FC of Brazil, which the Red Bulls won 3\u20131. In this preseason game, newly signed Estonian international midfielder [[Joel Lindpere]] became the first player to score a goal in Red Bull Arena. The Red Bulls carried this form into the first MLS match at Red Bull Arena against the Chicago Fire by winning 1\u20130 with the lone goal coming from Joel Lindpere. A week later, the Red Bulls defeated the [[Seattle Sounders FC|Seattle Sounders]] 1\u20130 at [[Qwest Field]] in Seattle, breaking a 27-game road winless streak.\n\nThe club signed legendary French forward [[Thierry Henry]] as a [[Designated Player Rule|designated player]] in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.eurosport.com/football/international-football/2009/new-york-confirm-henry_sto2397933/story.shtml|title=Henry goes to New York|date=July 14, 2010|publisher=Eurosport}}</ref> A month later on August 2, the Red Bulls signed their third designated player, Mexican international defender [[Rafael M\u00e1rquez]]. The signing of M\u00e1rquez established the Red Bulls as the first MLS team to have three designated players. With these new additions, the Red Bulls improved further and clinched first place in the Eastern Conference for the first time since 2000. New York also set an MLS record for best one-season improvement, finishing with 51 points after having just 21 points the previous year. Despite the impressive turnaround, the season again ended in disappointment for the Red Bulls. The Eastern Conference semi-finals saw the Red Bulls fall to the San Jose Earthquakes.

The next week, they played [[Real Salt Lake]] in the Western Conference final at [[Rio Tinto Stadium]] in [[Utah]]. Dave van den Bergh put the Red Bulls ahead. This win put the Red Bulls into the [[2008 MLS Cup]] final against MLS Supporters' Shield winners, the [[Columbus Crew]]. The Red Bulls lost 3\u20131, with their lone goal coming from [[John Wolyniec]].\n\nOn March 19, 2009, at [[Qwest Field]], the New York Red Bulls started the season against [[Seattle Sounders FC]] in Seattle's first ever MLS game, which Seattle won 3\u20130, with goals coming from [[Freddy Montero]] and [[Brad Evans]]. The official attendance of the game was 32,523. The tremendous run to the 2008 MLS Cup Final also brought another competition for the [[2009 New York Red Bulls season|2009 schedule]], the [[CONCACAF Champions League 2009\u201310]]. The New York Red Bulls took part in the tournament's second edition, starting in the qualifying round against Trinidad and Tobago side [[W Connection]].\n\nThe club's 2009 season was highly disappointing. They went on a 16-game winless streak which lasted from May 8 to August 23.  They also endured a 23-game winless streak on the road which dated back to May 10, 2008 in a 2\u20131 win over the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], in which they finish the season at 0\u201317\u20133 on the road. In the preliminary round of the Champions League, the Red Bulls played to a 2\u20132 draw against W Connection. However, in the second round the Red Bulls were eliminated from group play, losing 2\u20131 at Giants Stadium. After the preliminary exit from the Champions League, many fans were disappointed by Osorio's rigid tactical style, while others wanted then-Sporting Director [[Jeff Agoos]] fired. On August 21, 2009, Osorio resigned from his position. Assistant [[Richie Williams]] again took over as the club's interim coach. In his second stint as interim, Williams led the Red Bulls to a 3\u20132\u20133 record despite finishing with a league-worst record of 5\u20136\u201319 (21 pts).\n\n=== The Backe era and new stadium (2010\u20132012) ===\n[[File:Thierry Henry control cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thierry Henry]] was one of several high-profile signings by the Red Bulls in 2010]]\n\nThe [[2010 New York Red Bulls season|2010 season]] brought about a new stadium, a new sporting director and coaching staff, and a new group of players to the Red Bulls, who hoped to dramatically improve from their disappointing 2009 season. On January 7, 2010, the Red Bulls confirmed the hiring of veteran Swedish manager [[Hans Backe]] as head coach. Not long after Backe was confirmed as coach, he started to release many players signed by Osorio including [[Jorge Alberto Rojas|Jorge Rojas]], [[Danny Cepero]], [[Carlos Johnson (soccer)|Carlos Johnson]], and [[Walter Garc\u00eda]], while midfielder [[Matthew Mbuta]]'s contract was not picked up for the 2010 season. Under the direction of Backe and newly hired Norwegian sporting director [[Erik Sol\u00e9r]], the club began a new approach of signing veteran European players (mainly from [[Scandinavia]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]]) instead of the South American and Central American players that are usually sought after in MLS. With Backe as head coach, the Red Bulls went undefeated in the 2010 preseason, including the first ever match at [[Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)|Red Bull Arena]] against Santos FC of Brazil, which the Red Bulls won 3\u20131. In this preseason game, newly signed Estonian international midfielder [[Joel Lindpere]] became the first player to score a goal in Red Bull Arena. The Red Bulls carried this form into the first MLS match at Red Bull Arena against the Chicago Fire by winning 1\u20130 with the lone goal coming from Joel Lindpere. A week later, the Red Bulls defeated the [[Seattle Sounders FC|Seattle Sounders]] 1\u20130 at [[Qwest Field]] in Seattle, breaking a 27-game road winless streak.\n\nThe club signed legendary French forward [[Thierry Henry]] as a [[Designated Player Rule|designated player]] in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.eurosport.com/football/international-football/2009/new-york-confirm-henry_sto2397933/story.shtml|title=Henry goes to New York|date=July 14, 2010|publisher=Eurosport}}</ref> A month later on August 2, the Red Bulls signed their third designated player, Mexican international defender [[Rafael M\u00e1rquez]]. The signing of M\u00e1rquez established the Red Bulls as the first MLS team to have three designated players. With these new additions, the Red Bulls improved further and clinched first place in the Eastern Conference for the first time since 2000. New York also set an MLS record for best one-season improvement, finishing with 51 points after having just 21 points the previous year. Despite the impressive turnaround, the season again ended in disappointment for the Red Bulls. The Eastern Conference semi-finals saw the Red Bulls fall to the San Jose Earthquakes.

The brand is currently owned and distributed by [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]].\n\n==History==\nScalextric is a track based slot car racing system first invented by Fred (B F) Francis.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2530336/First-Scalextric-set-50-years-ago-given-inventors-grandchildren-Christmas-present.html |title=First Scalextric set is given to inventor Freddie Franciss grandchildren for Christmas present |first=Mia |last=De Graaf |work=Daily Mail Online |date=29 December 2013 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref> Scalextric was first made in [[Havant]], Hampshire in 1956.\n\nThe forerunner to Scalextric was Scalex, which Francis first produced through the company Minimodels Ltd which he had founded in 1947. The company was based in London and made tinplate toys and models. Early products included the Startex toy car range and the very popular Scalex, which was introduced in 1952. Scalex was a range of toy racing cars with [[clockwork]] motors which were activated by pulling out the steering wheel.\n\nIn 1952 Minimodels moved to a larger factory in New Lane, Havant to meet the growing demand for the toy cars. At the peak of its popularity, over 7,000 Scalex models were being produced weekly. By 1956 the novelty of clockwork racing cars had worn off and sales began to fall. Eventually the future of the company and its one hundred employees was threatened.\n\nIn an attempt to revive his company\u2019s flagging fortunes, Fred Francis began to look at alternatives. He was inspired by seeing model car racing tracks, but wanted to develop the player\u2019s control of the car so as to increase the sense of competition. He experimented by putting small electric motors into Scalex cars and running them on model railway track. Next he introduced rubber slotted track and gave the cars a \u2018gimbal\u2019 wheel to pick up the electric current in the groove of the track. Original tin-plate cars had one hard plastic rear wheel and one rubber-tired wheel, with gave different handling characteristics for left and right corners. Power was supplied by batteries hidden in a little cardboard hut, with players having their own on-off button to control their cars.\n\nScalex-electric became Scalextric.\n\nScalextric was unveiled at the Harrogate Toy Fair in 1957 to immediate acclaim. It appealed to both adults and children, combining speed, competition and the glamour of [[Formula One]] motor racing. Demand for the toy was immense and the Minimodels factory struggled to keep up with the orders.\n\nIn 1958 Fred Francis sold the Minimodels company to [[Lines Bros|Lines Brothers]] (who operated as \"Tri-ang\"). The popularity of Scalextric continued. In 1960 plastic bodies replaced the original tinplate and in 1961 production moved to a new factory in the Leigh Park area of Havant. By 1964 Scalextric was being advertised as \u2018the most complete model motor racing system in the world\u2019.\n\nProduction of Scalextric was transferred to [[Rovex]] in 1968 (although the Minimodels factory remained open until the early 1970s). It is now owned by [[Hornby Hobbies]] of England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/childhood-collections/toys/scalextric.htm |title=Scalextric Made in Hampshire |website=Hampshire Cultural Trust |accessdate=24 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427185408/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/childhood-collections/toys/scalextric.htm |archivedate=27 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Products==\n[[File:Scalextric Model Porsche 997 With White Background.JPG|thumb|A Porsche 997 Scalextric model]]\n[[File:Electric Brushes on Bottom of Scalextric Model.JPG|thumb|[[Brush (electric)|Electric pick-up brushes]] on the bottom of a Scalextric model]]\nThe first model Francis introduced in his Scalex line of tin-plate clockwork cars was the [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] XK120. These [[1:32 scale]] models had some unique features including a clockwork motor which was not wound by a key but by a 'fifth wheel' device. This wheel is found under the chassis behind the front axle and works by pressing the car down on a hard surface and being pulled backwards. This wound the clockwork motor and when the car was released it shot forward at speed. The Scalex range expanded to include six cars; the [[MG Cars|MG]] TF, [[Austin Healey]] 100, [[Aston Martin]] DB2, [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] 2.4 Saloon, [[Maserati]] 250F and [[Ferrari]] 375. The last 2 were in a slightly different 1:28 scale.\n\nScalex was very successful: at one point the company was producing up to 7,000 cars a week. Later cars also featured a steerable front axle which could be set at an angle and the cars would then run in an arc.<ref>{{cite book |title=Scalextric The History of the World's Favourite Model Racing Cars |first=Rod |last=Green |publisher=HarperCollins |location=UK |year=2001 |isbn=978-0007134212}}</ref>\n\nMost Scalextric models are [[1:32 scale]], though between 1968 and 1970 Super 124 cars and track were manufactured at 1:24 scale. In 1994 Micro Scalextric at [[1:64 scale]] was introduced. Cars and track are not compatible between scales.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, Scalextric track underwent a major redesign to make it easier to assemble. The new design is known as Scalextric Sport and can be connected to the original track using special adaptor pieces. The new track was designed to be compatible with all earlier 1:32 cars.\n\nMany other manufacturers, including the likes of ''Fly'', ''Slot.it'', ''SCX'', ''Airfix''/''MRRC'', ''Carrera'' and ''Ninco,'' produce cars that can run on Scalextric track with minor or no modification.\n\nIn 2004 '''Scalextric Sport Digital''' (SSD) was introduced, with which up to four digital cars can be raced in a single slot. The cars can change from one slot to another using special slot-lane change tracks, the lane change or otherwise being controlled by a button on the throttle. Sport Digital cars will run on analogue layouts without modification, but analogue cars require a digital decoder to be installed before they can run on a digital layout.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scalextric.com/customer-support/faq/scalextric-digital,12,SIF.html |title=Scalextric Digital |publisher=Scalextric.com |accessdate=11 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821035129/http://www.scalextric.com/customer-support/faq/scalextric-digital,12,SIF.html |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nMany of the original Scalextric cars can be fitted with a digital decoder depending on available space within the body shell. Performance of converted cars on a digital system can vary, but enthusiasts have been able to successfully convert a wide range of cars, both from Scalextric and other brands.\n\nAs use of Scalextric Digital has increased, a community has established itself where users have developed enhanced powerbase functionality, fuel management and timing systems for increased realism.\n\nTo convert Scalextric Sport into Scalextric Digital requires a digital power base, power supply (transformer), lane changing track (to utilise the full benefits), and digital controllers.\n\nIn late 2010, Scalextric released a revised six-car digital powerbase, C7042. This powerbase includes a separate screen which aids set up and also displays race information such as lap times. The company worked closely with customers when developing the new system. The result includes features such as yellow flag options for dealing with crashed cars, ghost cars to race against which can run and change lanes automatically, and the ability to race in analogue mode for older models that have not been converted to digital.\n\nIn Spain, Hornby Scalextric is marketed under the brand ''Superslot'', as the ''Scalextric'' brand is owned there by [[Tecnitoys]], whose products are sold internationally under the SCX brand. Whilst there are some common standards, parts of the two ranges, particularly in their digital offerings, are not compatible.\n\n==Sets==\nScalextric is typically sold as a set containing enough track to make a circuit, the necessary power supply and throttles and two cars. The cars are usually based on real vehicles from [[Formula 1]], [[A1 Grand Prix]], [[NASCAR]], rallying, touring, or [[Le Mans 24 Hours|Le Mans]], or based on ordinary road going cars. A number of novelty sets have been produced; for example, horse racing sets and 360 degree sets. The latter, produced sporadically since the 1960s, have a specially made guide that enables the car to run back the way it has come by spinning through 180 degrees.\n\n==Power and control==\nScalextric is controlled with a hand-held plunger, connected by wire to a connector on the set. A set normally has two to six plungers included. Mounted in the track (for each lane) are two metal rails, which for Analogue carry the DC current from the controllers, or for Digital have constant AC current passed through them, in either case picked up by two metal braids or plates on the underside of the racing cars.<ref>https://www.actionslotracing.co.uk/pages/advice-tips#C6</ref><ref>http://www.scalextric-car.co.uk/Catalogue/Articles/Article_Scalextric_Cars_and_Old_New_Track.htm</ref>\n\n== TV and film licensing ==\nSince the 1960s, Scalextric have offered TV and film [[tie-in]]s, beginning with the now rare and valuable James Bond 007 set featuring an Aston Martin with action features as shown in the film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''. Even the 'baddie' car in this set, a Mercedes, had action features of its own whilst the set also sported many other unique action points and props.\nIt was some time before Scalextric returned to licensing in the 1970s first with ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (the 1970s series), which had specially liveried TR7 cars and white track. Then, in the 1980s, came the original TV series based ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and then Tim Burton's ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' film.\n\nSince then the franchises have grown to include ''[[Batman Begins]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [[Transformers (film)|The ''Transformers'' movie]], ''[[James Bond]]'' 007 films ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', [[Skyfall]]'', [[GoldenEye]]'' and [[Spectre (2015 film)|''Spectre'']], ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'', ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'' (models from both the original and re-made films), ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'' and the ''[[Pixar]]/[[Disney]] Movie '[[Toy Story]]''.\n\nMany of these have appeared in both 1:32 and 1:64 scales.\n\nScalextric also produced a ''[[Dukes of Hazzard|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' ''[[General Lee (car)|General Lee]]'' car and more recently a twin car pack with licensing from the ''[[Fast and the Furious]]'' film franchise.\n\nScalextric has also recently licensed the ''[[Need for Speed]]'' brand from Electronic Arts and has produced a set based on the popular video game series.\n\nOn 22 November 2004, thieves stole 2,500 ''Simpsons'' Scalextric sets from the back of a [[truck|lorry]] which was parked near services on the [[M2 motorway (Great Britain)|M2 motorway]] in England.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4040893.stm|title=Thousands of Simpsons games taken|publisher=BBC | date=25 November 2004 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Vehicles==\nIn addition to various types of cars, Scalextric vehicles have included motorbikes, sidecars, go-karts, pickup trucks, SUVs, racing trucks, articulated trucks, horses, skateboards and bicycles.\n\n==Track==\nStandard track consists of straights of various lengths and corners of different radii and degree of turn. Special track includes several different styles of chicane, cross-over tracks, crossroad track and humpback bridge. Novelty pieces of track have included pit lane tracks, Le Mans start, blow-out track and loop-the-loop tracks.<ref name=\"Scalextric history\">[http://www.scalextricclub.com/pages/hist.aspx Scalextric history] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510100425/http://www.scalextricclub.com/pages/hist.aspx |date=10 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThere are five generations of 1:32 scale Scalextric track:\n#Original Scalextric Track (Mk. 1): This was made from rubber with thin, vertical electrical connectors, and held together with separate metal clips. This track had white lines between the lanes. Track produced during the 'Minimodels era' was slightly glossy and curved sections had side protrusions to allow for the attachment of the supplied crash barrier. Later 'Triang era' Mk 1 track dispensed with these, possibly because they thwarted future additions like outer radius curves. The later iteration had a more realistic matt finish to its road surface. The earliest track had a dedicated 'power straight' for the connections to each lane, whereas the later used power clips that were held in place between the contacts of any two track sections including curves. It was during this transition that the original on/off button control gave way to hand-held plungers with a greater degree of speed control.\n \n#Original Scalextric Track (Mk. 2): Released in 1962, the material became plastic, electrical connections were through wider, horizontal pins, and the track was held together by two integrated circular, spoon-shaped pins and sockets moulded into each end. Converter pieces were available to link the two types. It is now known as Classic track. Classic track is compatible with another leading brand, SCX's classic track.\n#Scalextric Sport: Released in 2001, another plastic track, but with a smoother surface. The track connectors are square and slot into place unlike the ring shaped Classic track ones. Converter pieces are available to link to Classic track.\n#Scalextric Digital: Released in 2004, Scalextric Digital is compatible with Sport. It allows up to 6 cars on a 2 lane track at one time, with each car fully controllable. This was a feature previously unavailable from Scalextric.\n#Scalextric Start: Released in 2010, Scalextric Start aims to be a basic track for children.

The brand is currently owned and distributed by [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]].\n\n==History==\nScalextric is a track based slot car racing system first invented by Fred (B F) Francis.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2530336/First-Scalextric-set-50-years-ago-given-inventors-grandchildren-Christmas-present.html |title=First Scalextric set is given to inventor Freddie Franciss grandchildren for Christmas present |first=Mia |last=De Graaf |work=Daily Mail Online |date=29 December 2013 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref> Scalextric was first made in [[Havant]], Hampshire in 1956.\n\nThe forerunner to Scalextric was Scalex, which Francis first produced through the company Minimodels Ltd which he had founded in 1947. The company was based in London and made tinplate toys and models. Early products included the Startex toy car range and the very popular Scalex, which was introduced in 1952. Scalex was a range of toy racing cars with [[clockwork]] motors which were activated by pulling out the steering wheel.\n\nIn 1952 Minimodels moved to a larger factory in New Lane, Havant to meet the growing demand for the toy cars. At the peak of its popularity, over 7,000 Scalex models were being produced weekly. By 1956 the novelty of clockwork racing cars had worn off and sales began to fall. Eventually the future of the company and its one hundred employees was threatened.\n\nIn an attempt to revive his company\u2019s flagging fortunes, Fred Francis began to look at alternatives. He was inspired by seeing model car racing tracks, but wanted to develop the player\u2019s control of the car so as to increase the sense of competition. He experimented by putting small electric motors into Scalex cars and running them on model railway track. Next he introduced rubber slotted track and gave the cars a \u2018gimbal\u2019 wheel to pick up the electric current in the groove of the track. Original tin-plate cars had one hard plastic rear wheel and one rubber-tired wheel, with gave different handling characteristics for left and right corners. Power was supplied by batteries hidden in a little cardboard hut, with players having their own on-off button to control their cars.\n\nScalex-electric became Scalextric.\n\nScalextric was unveiled at the Harrogate Toy Fair in 1957 to immediate acclaim. It appealed to both adults and children, combining speed, competition and the glamour of [[Formula One]] motor racing. Demand for the toy was immense and the Minimodels factory struggled to keep up with the orders.\n\nIn 1958 Fred Francis sold the Minimodels company to [[Lines Bros|Lines Brothers]] (who operated as \"Tri-ang\"). The popularity of Scalextric continued. In 1960 plastic bodies replaced the original tinplate and in 1961 production moved to a new factory in the Leigh Park area of Havant. By 1964 Scalextric was being advertised as \u2018the most complete model motor racing system in the world\u2019.\n\nProduction of Scalextric was transferred to [[Rovex]] in 1968 (although the Minimodels factory remained open until the early 1970s). It is now owned by [[Hornby Hobbies]] of England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/childhood-collections/toys/scalextric.htm |title=Scalextric Made in Hampshire |website=Hampshire Cultural Trust |accessdate=24 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427185408/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/childhood-collections/toys/scalextric.htm |archivedate=27 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Products==\n[[File:Scalextric Model Porsche 997 With White Background.JPG|thumb|A Porsche 997 Scalextric model]]\n[[File:Electric Brushes on Bottom of Scalextric Model.JPG|thumb|[[Brush (electric)|Electric pick-up brushes]] on the bottom of a Scalextric model]]\nThe first model Francis introduced in his Scalex line of tin-plate clockwork cars was the [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] XK120. These [[1:32 scale]] models had some unique features including a clockwork motor which was not wound by a key but by a 'fifth wheel' device. This wheel is found under the chassis behind the front axle and works by pressing the car down on a hard surface and being pulled backwards. This wound the clockwork motor and when the car was released it shot forward at speed. The Scalex range expanded to include six cars; the [[MG Cars|MG]] TF, [[Austin Healey]] 100, [[Aston Martin]] DB2, [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] 2.4 Saloon, [[Maserati]] 250F and [[Ferrari]] 375. The last 2 were in a slightly different 1:28 scale.\n\nScalex was very successful: at one point the company was producing up to 7,000 cars a week. Later cars also featured a steerable front axle which could be set at an angle and the cars would then run in an arc.<ref>{{cite book |title=Scalextric The History of the World's Favourite Model Racing Cars |first=Rod |last=Green |publisher=HarperCollins |location=UK |year=2001 |isbn=978-0007134212}}</ref>\n\nMost Scalextric models are [[1:32 scale]], though between 1968 and 1970 Super 124 cars and track were manufactured at 1:24 scale. In 1994 Micro Scalextric at [[1:64 scale]] was introduced. Cars and track are not compatible between scales.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, Scalextric track underwent a major redesign to make it easier to assemble. The new design is known as Scalextric Sport and can be connected to the original track using special adaptor pieces. The new track was designed to be compatible with all earlier 1:32 cars.\n\nMany other manufacturers, including the likes of ''Fly'', ''Slot.it'', ''SCX'', ''Airfix''/''MRRC'', ''Carrera'' and ''Ninco,'' produce cars that can run on Scalextric track with minor or no modification.\n\nIn 2004 '''Scalextric Sport Digital''' (SSD) was introduced, with which up to four digital cars can be raced in a single slot. The cars can change from one slot to another using special slot-lane change tracks, the lane change or otherwise being controlled by a button on the throttle. Sport Digital cars will run on analogue layouts without modification, but analogue cars require a digital decoder to be installed before they can run on a digital layout.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scalextric.com/customer-support/faq/scalextric-digital,12,SIF.html |title=Scalextric Digital |publisher=Scalextric.com |accessdate=11 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821035129/http://www.scalextric.com/customer-support/faq/scalextric-digital,12,SIF.html |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nMany of the original Scalextric cars can be fitted with a digital decoder depending on available space within the body shell. Performance of converted cars on a digital system can vary, but enthusiasts have been able to successfully convert a wide range of cars, both from Scalextric and other brands.\n\nAs use of Scalextric Digital has increased, a community has established itself where users have developed enhanced powerbase functionality, fuel management and timing systems for increased realism.\n\nTo convert Scalextric Sport into Scalextric Digital requires a digital power base, power supply (transformer), lane changing track (to utilise the full benefits), and digital controllers.\n\nIn late 2010, Scalextric released a revised six-car digital powerbase, C7042. This powerbase includes a separate screen which aids set up and also displays race information such as lap times. The company worked closely with customers when developing the new system. The result includes features such as yellow flag options for dealing with crashed cars, ghost cars to race against which can run and change lanes automatically, and the ability to race in analogue mode for older models that have not been converted to digital.\n\nIn Spain, Hornby Scalextric is marketed under the brand ''Superslot'', as the ''Scalextric'' brand is owned there by [[Tecnitoys]], whose products are sold internationally under the SCX brand. Whilst there are some common standards, parts of the two ranges, particularly in their digital offerings, are not compatible.\n\n==Sets==\nScalextric is typically sold as a set containing enough track to make a circuit, the necessary power supply and throttles and two cars. The cars are usually based on real vehicles from [[Formula 1]], [[A1 Grand Prix]], [[NASCAR]], rallying, touring, or [[Le Mans 24 Hours|Le Mans]], or based on ordinary road going cars. A number of novelty sets have been produced; for example, horse racing sets and 360 degree sets. The latter, produced sporadically since the 1960s, have a specially made guide that enables the car to run back the way it has come by spinning through 180 degrees.\n\n==Power and control==\nScalextric is controlled with a hand-held plunger, connected by wire to a connector on the set. A set normally has two to six plungers included. Mounted in the track (for each lane) are two metal rails, which for Analogue carry the DC current from the the controllers, or for Digital have constant AC current passed through them, in either case picked up by two metal braids or plates on the underside of the racing cars.<ref>https://www.actionslotracing.co.uk/pages/advice-tips#C6</ref><ref>http://www.scalextric-car.co.uk/Catalogue/Articles/Article_Scalextric_Cars_and_Old_New_Track.htm</ref>\n\n== TV and film licensing ==\nSince the 1960s, Scalextric have offered TV and film [[tie-in]]s, beginning with the now rare and valuable James Bond 007 set featuring an Aston Martin with action features as shown in the film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''. Even the 'baddie' car in this set, a Mercedes, had action features of its own whilst the set also sported many other unique action points and props.\nIt was some time before Scalextric returned to licensing in the 1970s first with ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (the 1970s series), which had specially liveried TR7 cars and white track. Then, in the 1980s, came the original TV series based ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and then Tim Burton's ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' film.\n\nSince then the franchises have grown to include ''[[Batman Begins]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [[Transformers (film)|The ''Transformers'' movie]], ''[[James Bond]]'' 007 films ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', [[Skyfall]]'', [[GoldenEye]]'' and [[Spectre (2015 film)|''Spectre'']], ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'', ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'' (models from both the original and re-made films), ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'' and the ''[[Pixar]]/[[Disney]] Movie '[[Toy Story]]''.\n\nMany of these have appeared in both 1:32 and 1:64 scales.\n\nScalextric also produced a ''[[Dukes of Hazzard|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' ''[[General Lee (car)|General Lee]]'' car and more recently a twin car pack with licensing from the ''[[Fast and the Furious]]'' film franchise.\n\nScalextric has also recently licensed the ''[[Need for Speed]]'' brand from Electronic Arts and has produced a set based on the popular video game series.\n\nOn 22 November 2004, thieves stole 2,500 ''Simpsons'' Scalextric sets from the back of a [[truck|lorry]] which was parked near services on the [[M2 motorway (Great Britain)|M2 motorway]] in England.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4040893.stm|title=Thousands of Simpsons games taken|publisher=BBC | date=25 November 2004 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Vehicles==\nIn addition to various types of cars, Scalextric vehicles have included motorbikes, sidecars, go-karts, pickup trucks, SUVs, racing trucks, articulated trucks, horses, skateboards and bicycles.\n\n==Track==\nStandard track consists of straights of various lengths and corners of different radii and degree of turn. Special track includes several different styles of chicane, cross-over tracks, crossroad track and humpback bridge. Novelty pieces of track have included pit lane tracks, Le Mans start, blow-out track and loop-the-loop tracks.<ref name=\"Scalextric history\">[http://www.scalextricclub.com/pages/hist.aspx Scalextric history] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510100425/http://www.scalextricclub.com/pages/hist.aspx |date=10 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThere are five generations of 1:32 scale Scalextric track:\n#Original Scalextric Track (Mk. 1): This was made from rubber with thin, vertical electrical connectors, and held together with separate metal clips. This track had white lines between the lanes. Track produced during the 'Minimodels era' was slightly glossy and curved sections had side protrusions to allow for the attachment of the supplied crash barrier. Later 'Triang era' Mk 1 track dispensed with these, possibly because they thwarted future additions like outer radius curves. The later iteration had a more realistic matt finish to its road surface. The earliest track had a dedicated 'power straight' for the connections to each lane, whereas the later used power clips that were held in place between the contacts of any two track sections including curves. It was during this transition that the original on/off button control gave way to hand-held plungers with a greater degree of speed control.\n \n#Original Scalextric Track (Mk. 2): Released in 1962, the material became plastic, electrical connections were through wider, horizontal pins, and the track was held together by two integrated circular, spoon-shaped pins and sockets moulded into each end. Converter pieces were available to link the two types. It is now known as Classic track. Classic track is compatible with another leading brand, SCX's classic track.\n#Scalextric Sport: Released in 2001, another plastic track, but with a smoother surface. The track connectors are square and slot into place unlike the ring shaped Classic track ones. Converter pieces are available to link to Classic track.\n#Scalextric Digital: Released in 2004, Scalextric Digital is compatible with Sport. It allows up to 6 cars on a 2 lane track at one time, with each car fully controllable. This was a feature previously unavailable from Scalextric.\n#Scalextric Start: Released in 2010, Scalextric Start aims to be a basic track for children. It has only one type of straight and corner, and each set can be made up into various layouts; the cars included in the sets are fantasy models, which reduce manufacturers' licensing costs, and a converter track piece is available to allow cars to cross from Start track to Sport and back again.\n\n==Scalextric racing in popular culture==\nIn 2009, [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' presenter [[James May]] announced plans to recreate the full length [[Brooklands|Brooklands racing track]] using Scalextric track and cars.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/surrey/8187656.stm|title=May to attempt Scalextric record|publisher=BBC | date=7 August 2009 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref> This was undertaken with a team of 350 volunteers building the track from an uncounted number of pieces of Scalextric track, navigating ponds and roads, closely following the route of the old Brooklands track.

It is headquartered in [[New York City]], with an additional office in [[Washington, D.C.]] Its membership, which numbers 4,900, has included senior politicians, more than a dozen [[United States Secretary of State|secretaries of state]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] directors, bankers, lawyers, professors and senior [[mass media|media]] figures.\n\nThe CFR meetings convene government officials, global business leaders and prominent members of the intelligence and foreign-policy community to discuss international issues. CFR publishes the bi-monthly journal ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', and runs the [[David Rockefeller]] Studies Program, which influences foreign policy by making recommendations to the presidential administration and [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] community, testifying before [[United States Congress|Congress]], interacting with the media, and publishing on foreign policy issues.\n\n==History==\n===Origins, 1918 to 1945===\n[[File:Elihu Root, bw photo portrait, 1902.jpg|thumb|[[Elihu Root]] (1845\u20131937) headed the first Council on Foreign Relations]]\nTowards the end of [[World War I]], a working fellowship of about 150 [[scholar]]s called \"[[The Inquiry]]\" was tasked to brief President [[Woodrow Wilson]] about options for the postwar world when Germany was defeated. This academic band, including Wilson's closest adviser and long-time friend \"Colonel\" [[Edward M.

Their reports formed the basis for the [[Fourteen Points]], which outlined Wilson's strategy for peace after war's end. These scholars then traveled to the [[Paris Peace Conference 1919]] and participated in the discussions there.<ref name=Grose>{{cite book|author=Grose, Peter|title=Continuing the Inquiry: The Council on Foreign Relations from 1921 to 1996|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations Press|year=2006|isbn=0876091923|url=https://archive.org/details/continuinginquir0000gros|url-access=registration}}</ref>{{rp|1\u20135}}\n\nAs a result of discussions at the Peace Conference, a small group of British and American diplomats and scholars met on May 30, 1919 at the [[Hotel Majestic (Paris)|Hotel Majestic]] in Paris and decided to create an Anglo-American organization called \"The Institute of International Affairs\", which would have offices in London and New York.<ref name=Shoup/>{{rp|12}}<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|5}} Due to the [[isolationist]] views prevalent in American society at the time, the scholars had difficulty gaining traction with their plan, and turned their focus instead to a set of discreet meetings that had been taking place since June 1918 in New York City, under the name \"Council on Foreign Relations.\" The meetings were headed by the [[Corporation|corporate]] lawyer [[Elihu Root]], who had served as [[Secretary of State]] under President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and attended by 108 \u201chigh-ranking officers of banking, manufacturing, trading and finance companies, together with many lawyers.\u201d The members were proponents of Wilson's [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], but were particularly concerned about \"the effect that the war and the treaty of peace might have on postwar business.\"<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|6\u20137}} The scholars from the inquiry saw an opportunity to create an organization that brought diplomats, high-level government officials and [[Academy|academics]] together with lawyers, bankers, and [[Business magnate|industrialists]] to engineer government policy.

Gay]], former dean of the [[Harvard Business School]] and director of the [[Shipping Board]] during the war, spearheaded the Council's efforts to begin publication of a magazine that would be the \"authoritative\" source on foreign policy. He gathered $125,000 from the wealthy members on the council, and via sending letters soliciting funds to \"the thousand richest Americans\". Using these funds, the first issue of ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' was published in September 1922, and within a few years had gained a reputation as the \"most authoritative American review dealing with international relations\".<ref name=Shoup/>{{rp|17\u201318}}\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = [T]he common interests very largely elude public opinion entirely, and can be managed only by a specialized class whose personal interests reach beyond the locality.|source=Former CFR board member [[Walter Lippman]], <br> ''Public Opinion'' (1922)|quoted = 1|width  = 20%|title = |align=left|tstyle = text-align: left;}}\nIn the late 1930s, the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[Rockefeller Foundation]] began contributing large amounts of money to the Council.<ref>{{Cite book|author=O'Brien, Thomas F.|title=The Century of U.S. Capitalism in Latin America|publisher=UNM Press|year=1999|isbn=9780826319968|pages=105\u2013106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMVF8jtZy0oC&pg=PA105}}</ref> In 1938 they created various Committees on Foreign Relations, which later became governed by the American Committees on Foreign Relations in [[Washington, D.C.]], throughout the country, funded by a grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]]. Influential men were to be chosen in a number of cities, and would then be brought together for discussions in their own communities as well as participating in an annual conference in New York. These local committees served to influence local leaders and shape public opinion to build support for the Council's policies, while also acting as \"useful listening posts\" through which the Council and U.S. government could \"sense the mood of the country\".<ref name=Shoup/>{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\nBeginning in 1939 and lasting for five years, the Council achieved much greater prominence within the government and the [[State Department]], when it established the strictly confidential ''[[War and Peace Studies]]'', funded entirely by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|23}} The secrecy surrounding this group was such that the Council members who were not involved in its deliberations were completely unaware of the study group's existence.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|26}} It was divided into four functional topic groups: economic and financial, security and [[armament]]s, territorial, and political. The security and armaments group was headed by [[Allen Welsh Dulles]] who later became a pivotal figure in the [[CIA]]'s predecessor, the [[Office of Strategic Services]]. The CFR ultimately produced 682 memoranda for the State Department, marked [[classified information|classified]] and circulated among the appropriate government departments.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|23\u201326}}\n\n=== Cold War era, 1945 to 1979 ===\n[[File:David Rockefeller - NARA - 195929 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[David Rockefeller]] (1915\u20132017), joined the Council in 1941 and was appointed as a director in 1949]]\nA critical study found that of 502 government officials surveyed from 1945 to 1972, more than half were members of the Council.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|48}} During the [[Eisenhower administration]] 40% of the top U.S. foreign policy officials were CFR members (Eisenhower himself had been a council member); under [[Truman Administration|Truman]], 42% of the top posts were filled by council members.

Kennan|George Kennan]] coined the term \"[[containment]]\".  The essay would prove to be highly influential in US foreign policy for seven upcoming presidential administrations. Forty years later, Kennan explained that he had never suspected the Russians of any desire to launch an attack on America; he thought that it was obvious enough and he did not need to explain it in his essay. [[William Bundy]] credited the CFR's study groups with helping to lay the framework of thinking that led to the [[Marshall Plan]] and [[NATO]]. Due to new interest in the group, membership grew towards 1,000.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|35\u201339}}\n\n[[File:Harold Pratt House 004.JPG|thumb|left|CFR Headquarters, located in the former [[Harold Pratt House]] in [[New York City]]]]\n[[Dwight D.

One member later said, \"whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics, he has learned at the study group meetings.\"<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|35\u201344}} The CFR study group devised an expanded study group called \"Americans for Eisenhower\" to increase his chances for the presidency. Eisenhower would later draw many Cabinet members from CFR ranks and become a CFR member himself. His primary CFR appointment was Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]].  Dulles gave a public address at the [[Harold Pratt House]] in New York City in which he announced a new direction for Eisenhower's foreign policy: \"There is no local defense which alone will contain the mighty land power of the communist world. Local defenses must be reinforced by the further deterrent of massive retaliatory power.\" After this speech, the council convened a session on \"Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy\" and chose [[Henry Kissinger]] to head it. Kissinger spent the following academic year working on the project at Council headquarters. The book of the same name that he published from his research in 1957 gave him national recognition, topping the national bestseller lists.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|39\u201341}}\n\nOn November 24, 1953, a study group heard a report from political scientist William Henderson regarding the ongoing conflict between [[France]] and Vietnamese Communist leader [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Viet Minh]] forces, a struggle that would later become known as the [[First Indochina War]]. Henderson argued that Ho's cause was primarily [[nationalism|nationalist]] in nature and that Marxism had \"little to do with the current revolution.\" Further, the report said, the United States could work with Ho to guide his movement away from Communism. State Department officials, however, expressed skepticism about direct American intervention in Vietnam and the idea was tabled. Over the next twenty years, the United States would find itself allied with anti-Communist [[South Vietnam]] and against Ho and his supporters in the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|40, 49\u201367}}\n\nThe Council served as a \"breeding ground\" for important American policies such as [[mutual deterrence]], [[arms control]], and [[nuclear non-proliferation]].<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|40\u201342}}\n\nIn 1962 the group began a program of bringing select Air Force officers to the Harold Pratt House to study alongside its scholars. The Army, Navy and Marine Corps requested they start similar programs for their own officers.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|46}}\n\nA four-year-long study of [[China\u2013United States relations|relations between America and China]] was conducted by the Council between 1964 and 1968. One study published in 1966 concluded that American citizens were more open to talks with China than their elected leaders. [[Henry Kissinger]] had continued to publish in ''Foreign Affairs'' and was appointed by [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] to serve as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Adviser]] in 1969. In 1971, he embarked on a secret trip to Beijing to broach talks with Chinese leaders. [[Richard Nixon]] went to China in 1972, and diplomatic relations were completely normalized by [[Jimmy Carter|President Carter]]'s Secretary of State, another Council member, [[Cyrus Vance]].<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|42\u201344}}\n\nVietnam created a rift within the organization. When [[Hamilton Fish Armstrong]] announced in 1970 that he would be leaving the helm of ''Foreign Affairs'' after 45 years, new chairman [[David Rockefeller]] approached a family friend, [[William Bundy]], to take over the position. Anti-war advocates within the Council rose in protest against this appointment, claiming that Bundy's hawkish record in the State and Defense Departments and the CIA precluded him from taking over an independent journal. Some considered Bundy a [[war criminal]] for his prior actions.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|50\u201351}}\n\nIn November 1979, while chairman of the CFR, David Rockefeller became embroiled in an international incident when he and Henry Kissinger, along with [[John J.

Henderson argued that Ho's cause was primarily [[nationalism|nationalist]] in nature and that Marxism had \"little to do with the current revolution.\" Further, the report said, the United States could work with Ho to guide his movement away from Communism. State Department officials, however, expressed skepticism about direct American intervention in Vietnam and the idea was tabled.

[[Henry Kissinger]] had continued to publish in ''Foreign Affairs'' and was appointed by [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] to serve as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Adviser]] in 1969. In 1971, he embarked on a secret trip to Beijing to broach talks with Chinese leaders.

When [[Hamilton Fish Armstrong]] announced in 1970 that he would be leaving the helm of ''Foreign Affairs'' after 45 years, new chairman [[David Rockefeller]] approached a family friend, [[William Bundy]], to take over the position.
