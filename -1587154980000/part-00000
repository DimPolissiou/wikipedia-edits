The main US forces defending [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]] (KSCB) were two [[Regiment#United States Marine Corps|regiments]] of the [[United States Marines Corps]] supported by elements from the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), as well as a small number of [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) troops. These were pitted against two to three [[army division|divisional-size]] elements of the [[North Vietnam]]ese [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN).\n\nThe US command in [[Saigon]] initially believed that combat operations around KSCB during 1967 were part of a series of minor PAVN offensives in the border regions. That appraisal was later altered when the PAVN was found to be moving major forces into the area. In response, US forces were built up before the PAVN isolated the Marine base. Once the base came under siege, a series of actions was fought over a period of five months. During this time, KSCB and the hilltop outposts around it were subjected to constant PAVN [[artillery]], mortar, and rocket attacks, and several infantry assaults. To support the Marine base, a massive aerial bombardment campaign ([[Operation Niagara]]) was launched by the USAF. Over 100,000 tons of bombs were dropped by US aircraft and over 158,000 artillery rounds were fired in defense of the base. Throughout the campaign, US forces used the latest technology to locate PAVN forces for targeting. Additionally, the logistical effort required to support the base once it was isolated demanded the implementation of other tactical innovations to keep the Marines supplied.\n\nIn March 1968, an overland relief expedition (Operation Pegasus) was launched by a combined Marine\u2013Army/ARVN task force that eventually broke through to the Marines at Khe Sanh. American commanders considered the defense of Khe Sanh a success, but shortly after the siege was lifted, the decision was made to dismantle the base rather than risk similar battles in the future. On 19 June 1968, the evacuation and destruction of KSCB began. Amid heavy shelling, the Marines attempted to salvage what they could before destroying what remained as they were evacuated. Minor attacks continued before the base was officially closed on 5 July. Marines remained around Hill 689, though, and fighting in the vicinity continued until 11 July until they were finally withdrawn, bringing the battle to a close.\n\nIn the aftermath, the North Vietnamese proclaimed a victory at Khe Sanh, while US forces claimed that they had withdrawn, as the base was no longer required. Historians have observed that the Battle of Khe Sanh may have distracted American and South Vietnamese attention from the buildup of [[Viet Cong]] (VC) forces in the south before the early 1968 [[Tet Offensive]]. Nevertheless, the US commander during the battle, General [[William Westmoreland]], maintained that the true intention of Tet was to distract forces from Khe Sanh.\n\n== Prelude ==\nThe village of Khe Sanh was the seat of government of H\u01b0\u01a1ng Hoa district, an area of Bru [[Degar|Montagnard]] villages and coffee plantations, situated about {{convert|7|mi}} from the Laotian frontier on [[National Road 9 (Vietnam)|Route 9]], the northernmost transverse road in South Vietnam. The badly deteriorated Route 9 ran from the coastal region through the western highlands, and then crossed the border into [[Laos]]. The origin of the combat base lay in the construction by [[United States Army Special Forces|US Army Special Forces]] of an airfield in August 1962 outside the village at an old French fort.<ref>Shulimson, p. 59.</ref> The camp then became a Special Forces outpost of the [[Civilian Irregular Defense Group]]s, whose purpose was to keep watch on PAVN infiltration along the border and to protect the local population.<ref name=Stanton35_48>Stanton, pp. 35\u201348.</ref>{{#tag:ref|For a succinct overview of the creation of the CIDG program and its operations.<ref name=Stanton35_48/>|group=Note}}\n\nJames Marino wrote that in 1964, General Westmoreland, the US commander in Vietnam, had determined, \"Khe Sanh could serve as a patrol base blocking enemy infiltration from Laos; a base for ... operations to harass the enemy in Laos; an airstrip for reconnaissance to survey the Ho Chi Minh Trail; a western anchor for the defenses south of the DMZ; and an eventual jumping-off point for ground operations to cut the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/strategic-crossroads-at-khe-sanh.htm |author=Marino, James I. |title=Strategic Crossroads at Khe Sanh |work=HistoryNet|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref> In November 1964, the Special Forces moved their camp to the Xom Cham Plateau, the future site of Khe Sanh Combat Base.<ref name=BPC131>Boston Publishing Company, p. 131.</ref>\n\n[[File:DMZ1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Map of northern [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]]]]\n\nDuring the winter of 1964, Khe Sanh became the location of a launch site for the highly classified [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam \u2013 Studies and Observations Group]] (the site was first established near the village and was later moved to the French fort).<ref>US Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, ''Command History 1965, Annex N''.

With a view to eventually gaining approval for an advance through Laos to interdict the Ho Chi Minh Trail, he determined, \"it was absolutely essential to hold the base\", and he gave the order for US Marines to take up positions around Khe Sanh. [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] subsequently began planning for incursion into Laos, and in October, construction of an airfield at Khe Sanh was completed.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThe plateau camp was permanently manned by the US Marines during 1967, when they established an outpost next to the airstrip. This base was to serve as the western anchor of Marine Corps forces, which had tactical responsibility for the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam known as [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]].<ref>Prados, pp. 140\u2013146</ref><ref>Dougan, Weiss, et al., p. 42.</ref> The Marines' defensive system stretched below the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) from the coast, along Route 9, to Khe Sanh.

All of these attacks were conducted by regimental-size PAVN/VC units, but unlike the usual hit-and-run tactics used previously, these were sustained and bloody affairs.<ref>Eggleston, pp. 16\u2013122.</ref>\n\nIn early October, the PAVN had intensified battalion-sized ground probes and sustained artillery fire against [[Con Thien]], a hilltop stronghold in the center of the Marines' defensive line south of the DMZ in northern Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province.<ref>Telfer, Rogers, and Fleming, pp. 129\u2013131.</ref> Mortar rounds, artillery shells, and 122&nbsp;mm rockets fell randomly, but incessantly, upon the base. The September bombardments ranged from 100 to 150 rounds per day, with a maximum on 25 September of 1,190 rounds.<ref>Maitland and McInerney, p. 164.</ref> Westmoreland responded by launching Operation Neutralize, an aerial and naval bombardment campaign designed to break the siege. For seven weeks, American aircraft dropped from 35,000 to 40,000 tons of bombs in nearly 4,000 airstrikes.<ref name=\"M&M165\">Maitland and McInerney, p. 165.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hill 875 Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Combat on Hill 875, the most intense of the battles around Dak To]]\n\nOn 27 October, a PAVN regiment attacked an [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) battalion at [[S\u00f4ng B\u00e9 Base Camp|Song Be]], capital of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long Province.<ref name=\"M&M165\"/> The PAVN fought for several days, took casualties, and fell back. Two days later, the PAVN 273rd Regiment attacked a Special Forces camp near the border town of [[First Battle of Loc Ninh|Loc Ninh]], in [[B\u00ecnh Long Province]].<ref name=\"M&M165\"/> Troops of the US [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] were able to respond quickly. After a ten-day battle, the attackers were pushed back into [[Cambodia]]. At least 852 PAVN soldiers were killed during the action, as opposed to 50 American and South Vietnamese dead.<ref name=\"M&M165\"/>\n\nThe heaviest action took place near [[Battle of Dak To|Dak To]], in the central highlands province of Kon Tum. There, the presence of the PAVN [[1st Division (Vietnam)|1st Division]] prompted a 22-day battle that had some of the most intense close-quarters fighting of the entire conflict.<ref>Stanton, pp. 160\u2013169.</ref> American intelligence estimated between 1,200 and 1,600 PAVN troops were killed, while 362 members of the US [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team (United States)|173rd Airborne Brigade]], and ARVN [[Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division|Airborne]] elements were killed in action. Nonetheless, three of the four battalions of the 4th Infantry and the entire 173rd were rendered combat ineffective during the battle.<ref>Maitland and McInerney, p. 183.</ref>\n\nAmerican intelligence analysts were quite baffled by this series of enemy actions. For them, no logic was apparent behind the sustained PAVN/VC offensives, other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time: they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions, and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.<ref>Palmer, pp. 213\u2013215.</ref>\n\n=== Hill fights ===\n{{details|The Hill Fights}}\n[[File:kasa.jpg|thumb|left|The Khe Sanh Valley]]\n\nThings remained quiet in the Khe Sanh area through 1966. Even so, Westmoreland insisted that it not only be occupied by the Marines, but that it also be reinforced.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 432.</ref> He was vociferously opposed by General [[Lewis W. Walt]], the Marine commander of I Corps. Walt argued heatedly that the real target of the American effort should be the pacification and protection of the population, not chasing the PAVN/VC in the hinterlands.<ref>Murphy 2003, pp. 3\u20137, 13\u201314.</ref> Westmoreland won out, however, and the [[1st Battalion, 3rd Marines|1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment]] (1/3 Marines) was dispatched to occupy the camp and airstrip on 29 September. By late January 1967, the 1/3 returned to Japan and was relieved by Bravo Company, [[1st Battalion 9th Marines|1st Battalion, 9th Marines]] (1/9 Marines). A single company was replacing an entire battalion.<ref>Telfer, Rogers, and Fleming, p. 33.</ref>\n\n[[File:KS2.jpg|thumb|The Hill Fights]]\nOn 24 April 1967, a patrol from Bravo Company became engaged with a PAVN force of unknown size north of Hill 861. This action prematurely triggered a PAVN offensive aimed at taking Khe Sanh. The PAVN forces were in the process of gaining elevated terrain before the launching of the main attack.<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 79.</ref> The [[2nd Battalion 3rd Marines|2nd]] and [[3rd Battalion 3rd Marines|3rd Battalions]] of the [[3rd Marine Regiment (United States)|3rd Marine Regiment]], under the command of Colonel John P. Lanigan, reinforced KSCB and were given the task of pushing the PAVN off of Hills 861, 881 North, and 881 South. PAVN forces were driven out of the area around Khe Sanh after suffering 940 casualties. The Marines suffered 155 killed in action and 425 wounded.<ref>Shore, p. 17.</ref> To prevent PAVN observation of the main base at the airfield (and their possible use as firebases), the hills of the surrounding Khe Sanh Valley had to be continuously occupied and defended by separate Marine elements.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 60\u201361.</ref>\n\nIn the wake of the hill fights, a lull in PAVN activity occurred around Khe Sanh. By the end of May, Marine forces were again drawn down from two battalions to one, the [[1st Battalion, 26th Marines]].<ref>Murphy 1997 p. 165.</ref> Lieutenant General [[Robert E. Cushman, Jr.]] relieved Walt as commander of III MAF in June.<ref>Long 2016, p. 125.</ref>\n\nOn 14 August, Colonel [[David E. Lownds]] took over as commander of the [[26th Marine Regiment]]. Sporadic actions were taken in the vicinity during the late summer and early fall, the most serious of which was the ambush of a supply convoy on Route 9. This proved to be the last overland attempt at resupply for Khe Sanh until the following March.<ref>Prados, p. 155.</ref> During December and early January, numerous sightings of PAVN troops and activities were made in the Khe Sanh area, but the sector remained relatively quiet.<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 233.</ref>\n\n=== Decisions ===\nA decision then had to be made by the American high command: either commit more of the limited manpower in I Corps to the defense of Khe Sanh or abandon the base.<ref name=Prados159>Prados and Stubbe, p. 159.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Only nine US battalions were available from Hue/Phu Bai northward.<ref name=Prados159/>|group=Note}} Westmoreland regarded this choice as quite simple. In his memoirs, he listed the reasons for a continued effort<blockquote>Khe Sanh could serve as a patrol base for blocking enemy infiltration from Laos along Route 9; as a base for SOG operations to harass the enemy in Laos; as an airstrip for reconnaissance planes surveying the Ho Chi Minh Trail; as the western anchor for defenses south of the DMZ; and as an eventual jump-off point for ground operations to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail.<ref name=Westmoreland236>Westmoreland, p. 236.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Westmoreland had been forwarding operational plans for an invasion of Laos since 1966. First there had been Operation Full Cry, the original three-division invasion plan. This was superseded by the smaller contingency plans ''Southpaw'' and ''High Port'' (1967).

Cushman, the new III MAF commander, supported Westmoreland (perhaps wanting to mend Army/Marine relations after the departure of Walt).<ref>Shulimson, p. 67.</ref> Other concerns raised included the assertion that the real danger to I Corps was from a direct threat to [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb]] City and other urban areas; that a defense would be pointless as a threat to infiltration, since PAVN troops could easily bypass Khe Sanh; that the base was too isolated and that the Marines \"had neither the helicopter resources, the troops, nor the logistical bases for such operations\". Additionally, Shore argues that the \"weather was another critical factor because the poor visibility and low overcasts attendant to the monsoon season made such operations hazardous.\"<ref>Shore, p. 47.</ref> Brigadier General Lowell English (assistant commander [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]]) complained that the defense of the isolated outpost was ludicrous. \"When you're at Khe Sanh, you're not really anywhere. You could lose it and you really haven't lost a damn thing.\"<ref name=\"D&W42\">Dougan and Weiss p. 42.</ref>\n\nAs far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all he needed to know was that the PAVN had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the prospect even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.<ref name=\"D&W42\"/>\n\n== Battle ==\n=== Attacks on the perimeter ===\n==== First skirmishes ====\nIn early December 1967, the PAVN appointed Major General [[Tran Quy Hai]] as the local commander for the actions around Khe Sanh, with Le Quang D\u1ea1o as his political commissar. In the coming days, a campaign headquarters was established around Sap Lit.<ref>Clarke, p. 146.</ref> Two divisions, the [[304th Division (Vietnam)|304th]] and the [[325th Division (Vietnam)|325th]], were assigned to the operation: the 325th was given responsibility for the area around the north, while the 304th was given responsibility for the southern sector.<ref>Clarke, p. 46.</ref> In attempting to determine PAVN intentions Marine intelligence confirmed that, within a period of just over a week, the 325th Division had moved into the vicinity of the base and two more divisions were within supporting distance. The 324th Division was located in the DMZ area {{convert|10\u201315|mi}} north of Khe Sanh while the [[320th Division (Vietnam)|320th Division]] was within easy reinforcing distance to the northeast.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 43.</ref> They were supported logistically from the nearby Ho Chi Minh Trail. As a result of this intelligence, KSCB was reinforced on 13 December by the 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment. According to the official PAVN history, by December 1967 the North Vietnamese had in place, or within supporting distance: the 304th, 320th, [[324th Division (Vietnam)|324th]] and 325th Infantry Divisions, the independent 270th infantry Regiment; five artillery regiments (the 16th, 45th, 84th, 204th, and 675th); three [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AAA]] regiments (the 208th, 214th, and 228th); four tank companies; one engineer regiment plus one independent engineer battalion; one signal battalion; and a number of local force units.<ref>Military Institute of Vietnam, p. 216.</ref>\n\n[[File:KhSh9colkey.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Dispositions of opposing forces, January 1968]]\n\nAt positions west of Hill 881 South and north of Co Roc Ridge, across the border in Laos, the PAVN established artillery, rocket, and mortar positions from which to launch attacks by fire on the base and to support its ground operations. The PAVN 130&nbsp;mm and 152&nbsp;mm artillery pieces, and 122&nbsp;mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105&nbsp;mm and 155&nbsp;mm howitzers.

After failing to respond to a challenge, they were fired upon and five were killed outright while the sixth, although wounded, escaped.{{#tag:ref|A myth has grown up around this incident.

At 00:30 on 21 January, Hill 861 was attacked by about 300 PAVN troops, the Marines, however, were prepared. The PAVN infantry, though bracketed by artillery fire, still managed to penetrate the perimeter of the defenses and were only driven back after severe close-quarters combat.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 258\u2013259.</ref>\n\nThe main base was then subjected to an intense mortar and rocket barrage. Hundreds of mortar rounds and 122-mm rockets slammed into the base, levelling most of the above-ground structures. One of the first enemy shells set off an explosion in the main ammunition dump. Many of the artillery and mortar rounds stored in the dump were thrown into the air and detonated on impact within the base. Soon after, another shell hit a cache of [[tear gas]], which saturated the entire area.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 44.</ref> The fighting and shelling on 21 January resulted in 14 Marines killed and 43 wounded.<ref>Shulimson, p. 261.</ref> Hours after the bombardment ceased, the base was still in danger. At around 10:00, the fire ignited a large quantity of explosives, rocking the base with another series of detonations.<ref>Shulimson, p. 260.</ref>\n\nAt the same time as the artillery bombardment at KSCB, an attack was launched against Khe Sanh village, seat of [[H\u01b0\u1edbng H\u00f3a District]]. The village, 3&nbsp;km south of the base, was defended by 160 local Bru troops, plus 15 American advisers. At dawn of 21 January, it was attacked by a roughly 300-strong PAVN battalion. A platoon from Company D, 1/26 Marines was sent from the base but was withdrawn in the face of the superior PAVN forces. Reinforcements from the ARVN 256th [[South Vietnamese Regional Force|Regional Force]] (RF) company were dispatched aboard nine [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1]] helicopters of the 282nd Assault Helicopter Company, but they were landed near the abandoned French fort/former FOB-3 which was occupied by the PAVN who killed many of the RF troops and 4 Americans, including Lieutenant colonel Joseph Seymoe the deputy adviser for Quang Tri Province and forcing the remaining helicopters to abandon the mission.

Declassified documents show that in response, Westmoreland considered using nuclear weapons. In 1970, the Office of Air Force History published a then \"top secret\", but now declassified, 106-page report, titled ''The Air Force in Southeast Asia: Toward a Bombing Halt, 1968''. Journalist Richard Ehrlich writes that according to the report, \"in late January, General Westmoreland had warned that if the situation near the DMZ and at Khe Sanh worsened drastically, nuclear or chemical weapons might have to be used.\" The report continues to state, \"this prompted Air Force chief of staff, General John McConnell, to press, although unsuccessfully, for JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff) authority to request Pacific Command to prepare a plan for using low-yield nuclear weapons to prevent a catastrophic loss of the U.S. Marine base.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JD17Ae01.html|title=The US's secret plan to nuke Vietnam, Laos |first= Richard|last= Ehrlich|website=Asia Times |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, ultimately the nuclear option was discounted by military planners. A secret memorandum reported by US Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], sent to US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on 19 February 1968, was declassified in 2005. It reveals that the nuclear option was discounted because of terrain considerations that were unique to South Vietnam, which would have reduced the effectiveness of tactical nuclear weapons. McNamara wrote: \"because of terrain and other conditions peculiar to our operations in South Vietnam, it is inconceivable that the use of nuclear weapons would be recommended there against either Viet Cong or North Vietnamese forces\". McNamara's thinking may have also been affected by his aide David Morrisroe (later VP at Cal Tech where McNamara later served as Trustee), whose brother Michael Morrisroe (1960 New York State Chess Champion) was serving at the base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www103.pair.com/adsd/khe-sanh/nukes/j021968a.jpg |title=Memorandum for the President, 19 February 1968 |last=McNamara |first=Robert |work=Khe Sanh Declassified Documents |accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Operation Niagara ====\n{{details|topic=the bombing campaign|Operation Niagara}}\n{{details|topic=the electronic sensor system|Operation Igloo White}}\nDuring January, the recently installed electronic sensors of [[Operation Igloo White|Operation Muscle Shoals]] (later renamed \"Igloo White\"), which were undergoing test and evaluation in southeastern Laos, were alerted by a flurry of PAVN activity along the Ho Chi Minh Trail opposite the northwestern corner of South Vietnam.

The Marines were extremely reluctant to relinquish authority over their aircraft to an Air Force general.<ref>Prados, pp. 295\u2013297.</ref> The command and control arrangement then in place in Southeast Asia went against Air Force doctrine, which was predicated on the single air manager concept. One headquarters would allocate and coordinate all air assets, distributing them wherever they were considered most necessary, and then transferring them as the situation required. The Marines, whose aircraft and doctrine were integral to their operations, were under no such centralized control. On 18 January, Westmoreland passed his request for Air Force control up the chain of command to [[United States Pacific Command|CINCPAC]] in Honolulu.<ref>Nalty, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nHeated debate arose among Westmoreland, [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] [[Leonard F.

Johnson backed the Marine position due to his concern over protecting the Army's air assets from Air Force co-option.<ref>Prados, p. 223.</ref> Westmoreland was so obsessed with the tactical situation that he threatened to resign if his wishes were not obeyed.<ref>Prados, p. 295.</ref> As a result, on 7 March, for the first time during the Vietnam War, air operations were placed under the control of a single manager.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Westmoreland insisted for several months that the entire Tet Offensive was a diversion, including, famously, attacks on downtown Saigon and obsessively affirming that the true objective of the North Vietnamese was Khe Sanh.<ref>Donaldson, p. 115.</ref>\n\n==== Fall of Lang Vei ====\n{{main|Battle of Lang Vei}}\nThe Tet Offensive was launched prematurely in some areas on 30 January. On the following night, a massive wave of PAVN/VC attacks swept throughout South Vietnam, everywhere except Khe Sanh. The launching of the largest enemy offensive thus far in the conflict did not shift Westmoreland's focus away from Khe Sanh. A press release prepared on the following day (but never issued), at the height of Tet, showed that he was not about to be distracted. \"The enemy is attempting to confuse the issue&nbsp;... I suspect he is also trying to draw everyone's attention away from the greatest area of threat, the northern part of I Corps. Let me caution everyone not to be confused.\"<ref>Prados, p. 286.</ref><ref>Pisor, p. 152.</ref>\n\nNot much activity (with the exception of patrolling) had occurred thus far during the battle for the Special Forces of Detachment A-101 and their four companies of Bru CIDGs stationed at Lang Vei. Then, on the morning of 6 February, the PAVN fired mortars into the Lang Vei compound, wounding eight Camp Strike Force soldiers.<ref name=Pike35>Pike 2013, p. 35.</ref> At 18:10 hours, the PAVN followed up their morning mortar attack with an artillery strike from 152&nbsp;mm howitzers, firing 60 rounds into the camp. The strike wounded two more Strike Force soldiers and damaged two bunkers.<ref name=Pike35/>\n\nThe situation changed radically during the early morning hours of 7 February. The Americans had forewarning of PAVN armor in the area from Laotian refugees from camp BV-33. SOG Reconnaissance teams also reported finding tank tracks in the area surrounding Co Roc mountain.<ref>Plaster, p. 154</ref> Although the PAVN was known to possess two armored regiments, it had not yet fielded an armored unit in South Vietnam, and besides, the Americans considered it impossible for them to get one down to Khe Sanh without it being spotted by aerial reconnaissance.<ref>Prados, pp. 319\u2013320.</ref>\n\nIt still came as a shock to the Special Forces troopers at Lang Vei when 12 tanks attacked their camp. The Soviet-built [[PT-76]] amphibious tanks of the 203rd Armored Regiment churned over the defenses, backed up by an infantry assault by the 7th Battalion, 66th Regiment and the 4th Battalion of the 24th Regiment, both elements of the 304th Division. The ground troops had been specially equipped for the attack with satchel charges, tear gas, and flame throwers. Although the camp's main defenses were overrun in only 13 minutes, the fighting lasted for several hours, during which the Special Forces men and Bru CIDGs managed to knock out at least five of the tanks.<ref>Prados, p. 329.</ref>\n\nThe Marines at Khe Sanh had a plan in place for providing a ground relief force in just such a contingency, but Lownds, fearing a PAVN ambush, refused to implement it. Lownds also rejected a proposal to launch a helicopter extraction of the survivors.<ref name=Shulimson276>Shulimson, p. 276.</ref> During a meeting at Da Nang at 07:00 the next morning, Westmoreland and Cushman accepted Lownds' decision. Army Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Ladd (commander, [[5th Special Forces Group]]), who had just flown in from Khe Sanh, was reportedly, \"astounded that the Marines, who prided themselves on leaving no man behind, were willing to write off all of the Green Berets and simply ignore the fall of Lang Vei.\"<ref name=Shulimson276/>\n\n[[File:Khe Sanh Lang Vei SF-Camp Map.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|Attack on Lang Vei]]\n\nLadd and the commander of the SOG compound (whose men and camp had been incorporated into the defenses of KSCB) proposed that, if the Marines would provide the helicopters, the SOG reconnaissance men would go in themselves to pick up any survivors.<ref>Prados, pp. 332\u2013333.</ref> The Marines continued to oppose the operation until Westmoreland actually had to issue an order to Cushman to allow the rescue operation to proceed.<ref>Prados, p. 333.</ref> The relief effort was not launched until 15:00, and it was successful. Of the 500 CIDG troops at Lang Vei, 200 had been killed or were missing and 75 more were wounded. Of the 24 Americans at the camp, 10 had been killed and 11 wounded.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 47.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The official North Vietnamese history claimed that 400 South Vietnamese troops had been killed and 253 captured. It claimed, however, that only three American advisors were killed during the action.<ref>Military History Institute of Vietnam, p. 222.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nLownds infuriated the Special Forces personnel even further when the indigenous survivors of Lang Vei, their families, civilian refugees from the area, and Laotian survivors from the camp at Ban Houei Sane arrived at the gate of KSCB. Lownds feared that PAVN infiltrators were mixed up in the crowd of more than 6,000, and lacked sufficient resources to sustain them. Overnight, they were moved to a temporary position a short distance from the perimeter and from there, some of the Laotians were eventually evacuated, although the majority turned around and walked back down Route 9 toward Laos.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 276\u2013277.</ref>\n\nThe Lao troops were eventually flown back to their homeland, but not before the Laotian regional commander remarked that his army had to \"consider the South Vietnamese as enemy because of their conduct.\"<ref>Prados, p. 338.</ref> The Bru were excluded from evacuation from the highlands by an order from the ARVN I Corps commander, who ruled that no Bru be allowed to move into the lowlands.<ref>Prados, p. 340.</ref> Ladd, back on the scene, reported that the Marines stated, \"they couldn't trust any gooks in their damn camp.\"<ref name=Shulimson277>Shulimson, p. 277.</ref> There had been a history of distrust between the Special Forces personnel and the Marines, and General [[Rathvon M. Tompkins]], commander of the 3rd Marine Division, described the Special Forces soldiers as \"hopped up&nbsp;... wretches&nbsp;... [who] were a law unto themselves.\"<ref>Pisor, p. 76.</ref> At the end of January, Tompkins had ordered that no Marine patrols proceed more than 500 meters from the Combat Base.<ref name=\"Shulimson, p. 269\"/> Regardless, the SOG reconnaissance teams kept patrolling, providing the only human intelligence available in the battle area. This, however, did not prevent the Marine tanks within the perimeter from training their guns on the SOG camp.<ref name=Shulimson277/>\n\n==== Logistics and supporting fire ====\nLownds estimated that the logistical requirements of KSCB were 60 tons per day in mid-January and rose to 185 tons per day when all five battalions were in place.<ref>Shore, p. 90.</ref> The greatest impediments to the delivery of supplies to the base were the closure of Route 9 and the winter monsoon weather. For most of the battle, low-lying clouds and fog enclosed the area from early morning until around noon, and poor visibility severely hampered aerial resupply.<ref name=Shore72>Shore, p. 72.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe Sanh LAPES C-130.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|A C-130 delivering supplies with LAPES]]\n\nMaking matters worse for the defenders, any aircraft that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to PAVN antiaircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of PAVN artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then had to contend with antiaircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65% of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the USAF, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 49.</ref> The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the [[Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System]], in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The pallet slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land.<ref name=Barry>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/air-power-in-the-siege-of-khe-sanh.htm |title=Air Power in the Siege of Khe Sanh |work=HistoryNet |author=Barry, William A. |accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> The USAF delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop).

The fire of PAVN antiaircraft units took its toll of helicopters that made the attempt. The Marines found a solution to the problem in the \"Super Gaggle\" concept. A group of 12 [[A-4 Skyhawk]] fighter-bombers provided flak suppression for massed flights of 12\u201316 helicopters, which would resupply the hills simultaneously. The adoption of this concept at the end of February was the turning point in the resupply effort. After its adoption, Marine helicopters flew in 465 tons of supplies during February. When the weather later cleared in March, the amount was increased to 40 tons per day.<ref>Shore, p. 89.</ref>\n\nAs more infantry units had been assigned to defend KSCB, artillery reinforcement kept pace. By early January, the defenders could count on fire support from 46 artillery pieces of various calibers, five tanks armed with 90-mm guns, and 92 single or [[Ontos]]-mounted 106-mm recoilless rifles.<ref>Shore, p. 33.</ref> The base could also depend on fire support from US Army 175-mm guns located at [[Camp Carroll]], east of Khe Sanh.

Company. 37th Sig. Brigade in Danang. They used the latest microwave/tropespheric scatter systems to maintain communication links with military command in Danang.  The detachment's signal site was located beside the airstrip where they linked to a microwave/tropo site in Hue manned by the 513th Signal Det.  From Hue the communication signal was forwarded to Danang headquarters where it could be sent anywhere in the world.<ref>https://armyhistory.org/1st-signal-brigade/</ref>     \n\n==== Attacks prior to relief of the base ====\nOn the night of the fall of Lang Vei, three companies of the PAVN 101D Regiment moved into jump-off positions to attack Alpha-1, an outpost just outside the Combat Base held by 66 men of Company A, 1st Platoon, 1/9 Marines. At 04:15 on 8 February under cover of fog and a mortar barrage, the PAVN penetrated the perimeter, overrunning most of the position and pushing the remaining 30 defenders into the southwestern portion of the defenses. For some unknown reason, the PAVN troops did not press their advantage and eliminate the pocket, instead throwing a steady stream of grenades at the Marines.<ref name=\"Shulimson277\"/> At 07:40, a relief force from Company A, 2nd Platoon set out from the main base and attacked through the PAVN, pushing them into supporting tank and artillery fire.<ref>Prados, p. 348.</ref> By 11:00, the battle was over, Company A had lost 24 dead and 27 wounded, while 150 PAVN bodies were found around the position, which was then abandoned.<ref>Shulimson, p.278.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe-Sanh-Web.gif|thumb|The Khe Sanh perimeter, 28 February 1968: A white dotted line indicates a PAVN trench just 200 m from 37th ARVN Rangers along the southern perimeter of Khe Sanh.]]\n\nOn 23 February, KSCB received its worst bombardment of the entire battle. During one 8-hour period, the base was rocked by 1,307 rounds, most of which came from [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|130-mm]] (used for the first time on the battlefield) and 152-mm artillery pieces located in Laos.<ref>Shulimson, p. 279.</ref> Casualties from the bombardment were 10 killed and 51 wounded. Two days later, US troops detected PAVN trenches running due north to within 25 m of the base perimeter.<ref name=Shulimson279_280>Shulimson, pp. 279\u2013280.</ref> The majority of these were around the southern and southeastern corners of the perimeter, and formed part of a system that would be developed throughout the end of February and into March until they were ready to be used to launch an attack, providing cover for troops to advance to jumping-off points close to the perimeter.<ref name=Barry/> These tactics were reminiscent of those employed against the French at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bien Phu]] in 1954, particularly in relation to entrenching tactics and artillery placement, and the realization assisted US planners in their targeting decisions.<ref>Wirtz, p.197.</ref><ref>Shore, p. 111.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the same day that the trenches were detected, 25 February, 3rd Platoon from Bravo Company 1st Battalion, 26th Marines was ambushed on a short patrol outside the base's perimeter to test the PAVN strength. The Marines pursued three enemy scouts, who led them into an ambush. The platoon withdrew following a three-hour battle that left six Marines dead, 24 missing, and one taken prisoner.<ref name=Shulimson279_280/>\n\n[[File:M107 Firing Vietnam 2.jpg|thumb|left|An Army 175-mm M107 at Camp Carroll provides fire support for ground forces]]\n[[File:Marine Corps sniper team, Khe Sanh Valley.jpg|thumb|left|Marine Corps sniper team searches for targets in the Khe Sanh Valley]]\n\nIn late February, ground sensors detected the 66th Regiment, 304th Division preparing to mount an attack on the positions of the 37th ARVN Ranger Battalion on the eastern perimeter.<ref name=Shulimson281>Shulimson, p. 281.</ref> On the night of 28 February, the combat base unleashed artillery and airstrikes on possible PAVN staging areas and routes of advance. At 21:30, the attack came on, but it was stifled by the small arms of the Rangers, who were supported by thousands of artillery rounds and air strikes. Two further attacks later in the morning were halted before the PAVN finally withdrew. The PAVN, however, were not through with the ARVN troops. Five more attacks against their sector were launched during March.<ref name=Shulimson281/>\n\nBy mid-March, Marine intelligence began to note an exodus of PAVN units from the Khe Sanh sector.<ref name=Shulimson281/> The 325C Divisional Headquarters was the first to leave, followed by the 95C and 101D Regiments, all of which relocated to the west. At the same time, the 304th Division withdrew to the southwest. That did not mean, however, that battle was over. On 22 March, over 1,000 North Vietnamese rounds fell on the base, and once again, the ammunition dump was detonated.<ref>Shulimson, p. 282.</ref>\n\nOn 30 March, Bravo Company, 26th Marines, launched an attack toward the location of the ambush that had claimed so many of their comrades on 25 February. Following a rolling barrage fired by nine artillery batteries, the Marine attack advanced through two PAVN trenchlines, but the Marines failed to locate the remains of the men of the ambushed patrol. The Marines claimed 115 PAVN killed, while their own casualties amounted to 10 dead, 100 wounded, and two missing.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 282\u2013283.</ref> At 08:00 the following day, Operation Scotland was officially terminated. Operational control of the Khe Sanh area was handed over to the US Army's [[1st Air Cavalry Division]] for the duration of Operation Pegasus.<ref name=Shulimson283>Shulimson, p. 283.</ref>\n\nCumulative friendly casualties for Operation Scotland, which began on 1 November 1967, were: 205 killed in action, 1,668 wounded, and 25 missing and presumed dead.<ref name=Shore131>Shore, p.131</ref> These figures do not include casualties among Special Forces troops at Lang Vei, aircrews killed or missing in the area, or Marine replacements killed or wounded while entering or exiting the base aboard aircraft. As far as PAVN casualties were concerned, 1,602 bodies were counted, seven prisoners were taken, and two soldiers defected to allied forces during the operation. American intelligence estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 PAVN troops were killed during the operation, equating to up to 90% of the attacking 17,200-man PAVN force.<ref name=Shulimson283/><ref name=Shore131/> The PAVN acknowledged 2,500 men killed in action.<ref name=autogenerated2>Dougan and Weiss, p. 55.</ref> They also reported 1,436 wounded before mid-March, of which 484 men returned to their units, while 396 were sent up the Ho Chi Minh Trail to hospitals in the north.<ref name=autogenerated4/>\n\n==== President Johnson orders that the base be held at all costs ====\nThe fighting at Khe Sanh was so volatile that the Joint Chiefs and MACV commanders were uncertain that the base could be held by the Marines. In the US, the media following the battle drew comparisons with the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which proved disastrous for the French.<ref>Ryan 1984, p.75.</ref><ref>Welburn 1996, p. 51.</ref> Nevertheless, according to Tom Johnson, President Johnson was \"determined that Khe Sanh [would not] be an 'American Dien Bien Phu'\". He subsequently ordered the US military to hold Khe Sanh at all costs. As a result, \"B-52 [[Operation Arc Light|Arc Light strikes]] originating in Guam, Okinawa, and Thailand bombed the jungles surrounding Khe Sanh into stubble fields\" and Khe Sanh became the major news headline coming out of Vietnam in late March 1968.<ref>Johnson, Chapter 18.</ref>\n\n=== Relief and retreat from Khe Sanh ===\n==== Operation Pegasus (1\u201314 April 1968) ====\nPlanning for the overland relief of Khe Sanh had begun as early as 25 January 1968, when Westmoreland ordered General [[John J. Tolson]], commander, First Cavalry Division, to prepare a contingency plan. Route 9, the only practical overland route from the east, was impassable due to its poor state of repair and the presence of PAVN troops. Tolson was not happy with the assignment, since he believed that the best course of action, after Tet, was to use his division in an attack into the [[A Shau Valley]]. Westmoreland, however, was already planning ahead. Khe Sanh would be relieved and then used as the jump-off point for a \"hot pursuit\" of enemy forces into Laos.<ref>Prados, pp. 418\u2013420.</ref>\n\nOn 2 March, Tolson laid out what became known as Operation Pegasus, the operational plan for what was to become the largest operation launched by III MAF thus far in the conflict. The [[2nd Battalion 1st Marines|2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment]] (2/1 Marines) and the 2/3 Marines would launch a ground assault from [[Ca Lu Combat Base]] (16&nbsp;km east of Khe Sanh) and head west on Route 9 while the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Brigades of the 1st Cavalry Division, would air-assault key terrain features along Route 9 to establish fire support bases and cover the Marine advance. The advance would be supported by 102 pieces of artillery.<ref>Prados, p. 428.</ref> The Marines would be accompanied by their 11th Engineer Battalion, which would repair the road as the advance moved forward. Later, the 1/1 Marines and 3rd ARVN Airborne Task Force (the 3rd, 6th, and 8th Airborne Battalions) would join the operation.<ref>Prados, p. 419.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe Sanh Operation Pegasus First Cavalry.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division moving towards Khe Sanh Combat Base during Operation Pegasus]]\n\nWestmoreland's planned relief effort infuriated the Marines, who had not wanted to hold Khe Sanh in the first place and who had been roundly criticized for not defending it well.<ref>Murphy 2003, pp. 239\u2013240. See also Pisor, p. 108.</ref> The Marines had constantly argued that technically, Khe Sanh had never been under siege, since it had never truly been isolated from resupply or reinforcement. Cushman was appalled by the \"implication of a rescue or breaking of the siege by outside forces.\"<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 240.</ref>\n\nRegardless, on 1 April, Operation Pegasus began.<ref>Shulimson, p. 284.</ref> Opposition from the North Vietnamese was light and the primary problem that hampered the advance was continual heavy morning cloud cover that slowed the pace of helicopter operations. As the relief force made progress, the Marines at Khe Sanh moved out from their positions and began patrolling at greater distances from the base. Things heated up for the air cavalrymen on 6 April, when the 3rd Brigade encountered a PAVN blocking force and fought a day-long engagement.<ref name=Shulimson287>Shulimson, p. 287.</ref>\n\nOn the following day, the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Air Cavalry captured the old French fort near Khe Sanh village after a three-day battle. The link-up between the relief force and the Marines at KSCB took place at 08:00 on 8 April, when the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment entered the camp.<ref>Shulimson, p. 286.</ref> The 11th Engineers proclaimed Route 9 open to traffic on 11 April. On that day, Tolson ordered his unit to immediately make preparations for [[Operation Delaware]], an air assault into the A Shau Valley.<ref name=Shulimson287/> At 08:00 on 15 April, Operation Pegasus was officially terminated.<ref name=\"Shulimson, p. 289\">Shulimson, p. 289.</ref> Total US casualties during the operation were 92 killed, 667 wounded, and five missing.

Casualties were heavy among the attacking PAVN, who lost over 200 killed, while the defending Marines lost two men.<ref>Shulimson, p. 326.</ref> The official closure of the base came on 5 July after fighting, which had killed five more Marines. The withdrawal of the last Marines under the cover of darkness was hampered by the shelling of a bridge along Route 9, which had to be repaired before the withdrawal could be completed.<ref name=\"historynet_a\"/>\n\nFollowing the closure of the base, a small force of Marines remained around Hill 689 carrying out mopping-up operations.<ref name=\"historynet_a\"/>  Further fighting followed, resulting in the loss of another 11 Marines and 89 PAVN soldiers, before the Marines finally withdrew from the area on 11 July.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> According to Brush, it was \"the only occasion in which Americans abandoned a major combat base due to enemy pressure\" and in the aftermath, the North Vietnamese began a strong propaganda campaign, seeking to exploit the US withdrawal and to promote the message that the withdrawal had not been by choice.<ref name=autogenerated10 />\n\nRegardless, the PAVN had gained control of a strategically important area, and its lines of communication extended further into South Vietnam.<ref name=Rottman90/>  Once the news of the closure of KSCB was announced, the American media immediately raised questions about the reasoning behind its abandonment. They asked what had changed in six months so that American commanders were willing to abandon Khe Sanh in July. The explanations given out by the Saigon command were that \"the enemy had changed his tactics and reduced his forces; that PAVN had carved out new infiltration routes; that the Marines now had enough troops and helicopters to carry out mobile operations; that a fixed base was no longer necessary.\"<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 54.</ref>\n\nWhile KSCB was abandoned, the Marines continued to patrol the Khe Sanh plateau, including reoccupying the area with ARVN forces from 5\u201319 October 1968 with minimal opposition.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 409\u2013410.</ref> On 31 December 1968, the [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] was landed west of Khe Sanh to commence [[Operation Dawson River West]], on 2 January 1969 the 9th Marines and 2nd ARVN Regiment were also deployed on the plateau supported by the newly established Fire Support Bases Geiger and Smith; the 3-week operation found no significant PAVN forces or supplies in the Khe Sanh area.<ref>Smith, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> From 12 June to 6 July 1969, ''Task Force Guadalcanal'' comprising 1/9 Marines, [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment]] and 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 2nd ARVN Regiment occupied the Khe Sanh area in [[Operation Utah Mesa]].<ref>Smith, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> The Marines occupied [[Hill 950]] overlooking the Khe Sanh plateau from 1966 until September 1969 when control was handed to the Army who used the position as a SOG operations and support base until it was overrun by the PAVN in June 1971.<ref>Smith, p. 152.</ref><ref>Long 2013, pp. 355\u2013362.</ref> The gradual withdrawal of US forces began during 1969 and the adoption of [[Vietnamization]] meant that, by 1969, \"although limited tactical offensives abounded, US military participation in the war would soon be relegated to a defensive stance.\"<ref>Stanton, p. 246.</ref>\n\nAccording to military historian [[Ronald Spector]], to reasonably record the fighting at Khe Sanh as an American victory is impossible.<ref name=\"historynet_a\"/> With the abandonment of the base, according to Thomas Ricks, \"Khe Sanh became etched in the minds of many Americans as a symbol of the pointless sacrifice and muddled tactics that permeated a doomed U.S. war effort in Vietnam\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/05/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-khe-sanh/|title=5 things you didn't know about Khe Sanh |author=Ricks, Thomas E. |date=5 June 2014|website=FP |access-date=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n=== Termination of the McNamara Line ===\nCommencing in 1966, the US had attempted to establish a barrier system across the DMZ to prevent infiltration by North Vietnamese troops. Known as the [[McNamara Line]], it was initially codenamed \"Project Nine\" before being renamed \"Dye Marker\" by MACV in September 1967. This occurred just as the PAVN began the first phase of their offensive, launching attacks against Marine-held positions across the DMZ. These attacks hindered the advancement of the McNamara Line, and as the fighting around Khe Sanh intensified, vital equipment including sensors and other hardware had to be diverted from elsewhere to meet the needs of the US garrison at Khe Sanh. Construction on the line was ultimately abandoned and resources were later diverted towards implementing a more mobile strategy.<ref name=autogenerated8 />\n\n=== Assessment ===\nThe precise nature of Hanoi's strategic goal at Khe Sanh is regarded as one of the most intriguing unanswered questions of the Vietnam War. According to Gordon Rottman, even the North Vietnamese official history, ''Victory in Vietnam'', is largely silent on the issue.<ref>Rottman, Opposing plans.</ref> This question, known among American historians as the \"riddle of Khe Sanh\" has been summed up by John Prados and Ray Stubbe: \"Either the Tet Offensive was a diversion intended to facilitate PAVN/VC preparations for a war-winning battle at Khe Sanh, or Khe Sanh was a diversion to mesmerize Westmoreland in the days before Tet.\"<ref>Prados, p. 173.</ref> In assessing North Vietnamese intentions, Peter Brush cites the Vietnamese theater commander, [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]]'s claim \"that Khe Sanh itself was not of importance, but only a diversion to draw U.S. forces away from the populated areas of South Vietnam\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/BattleKheSanh1968.htm |title=The Battle of Khe Sanh |author=Brush, Peter |accessdate=10 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716230121/http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/BattleKheSanh1968.htm |archivedate=16 July 2012  }}</ref> This has led other observers to conclude that the siege served a wider PAVN strategy; it diverted 30,000 US troops away from the cities that were the main targets of the Tet Offensive.<ref>Page and Pimlott, p. 324.</ref>\n\nWhether the PAVN actually planned to capture Khe Sanh and whether the battle was an attempt to replicate the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] triumph against the French at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu has long been a point of contention. Westmoreland believed that the latter was the case and this belief was the basis for his desire to stage \"Dien Bien Phu in reverse\".<ref>Pisor, p. 61.</ref> Those who agree with Westmoreland reason that no other explanation exists as to why Hanoi would have committed so many forces to the area instead of deploying them for the Tet Offensive. The fact that the North Vietnamese only committed about half of their available forces to the offensive (60\u201370,000), the majority of whom were VC, is cited in favor of Westmoreland's argument. Other theories argued that the forces around Khe Sanh were simply a localized defensive measure in the DMZ area, or that they were serving as a reserve in case of an offensive American end run in the mode of the American [[Battle of Inchon|invasion at Inchon]] during the [[Korean War]]. However, North Vietnamese sources claim that the Americans did not win a victory at Khe Sanh, but they were forced to retreat to avoid destruction. The PAVN claimed that Khe Sanh was \"a stinging defeat from both the military and political points of view\": Westmoreland was replaced two months after the end of the battle and his successor explained the retreat in different ways.<ref name=\"historynet_a\" />\n\n[[File:Wallace Greene, Robert Cushman and William Westmoreland.jpg|thumb|left|General Wallace Greene, Commandant of the Marine Corps (l), Lieutenant General Robert Cushman, III MAF Commander (c), and General William Westmoreland (r)]]\n\nGeneral [[Creighton Abrams]] has also suggested that the North Vietnamese may have been planning to emulate Dien Bien Phu. He believed that the PAVN's actions during Tet proved it.<ref>Warren, p. 333.</ref> He cited the fact that it would have taken longer to [[Battle of Hu\u1ebf|dislodge the North Vietnamese at Hue]] if the PAVN had committed the three divisions at Khe Sanh to the battle there (although the PAVN did commit three regiments to the fighting from the Khe Sanh sector), instead of dividing their forces.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 38.</ref>\n\nAnother interpretation was that the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy has come to be known as the Option Play. If the PAVN could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive.<ref>Pisor, p. 210.</ref> This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the PAVN would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but the price they were willing to pay had limits. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that the actions around Khe Sanh (and the other border battles) were simply a feint, a ruse meant to focus American attention (and forces) on the border. General and historian Dave Palmer accepts this rationale: \"General Giap never had any intention of capturing Khe Sanh&nbsp;... [it] was a feint, a diversionary effort. And it had accomplished its purpose magnificently.\"<ref>Palmer, p. 219.</ref>{{#tag:ref|This is also the position taken in the official PAVN history, but which offers no further explanation of the strategy.<ref>Military History Institute of Vietnam, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nMarine General Rathvon M. Tompkins, commander of the 3rd Marine Division, has pointed out that had the PAVN actually intended to take Khe Sanh, PAVN troops could have cut the base's sole source of water, a stream 500 m outside the perimeter of the base. Had they simply contaminated the stream, the airlift would not have provided enough water to the Marines.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Marine Lieutenant General [[Victor Krulak]] seconded the notion that there was never a serious intention to take the base by also arguing that neither the water supply nor the telephone land lines were ever cut by the PAVN.<ref>Krulak, p. 218.</ref><ref>Shulimson p. 289.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe Sahn airstrip looking west.JPG|thumb|right|Khe Sanh airstrip, December 2006]]\n\nOne argument leveled by Westmoreland at the time (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several PAVN divisions.<ref>Pisor, p. 240.</ref> At the time Hanoi made the decision to move in around the base, though, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. Whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four PAVN divisions was debatable. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops\u2014nearly 50 maneuver battalions\u2014to I Corps.<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 235.</ref><br />\n\n=== Use during Operation Lam Son 719 ===\nOn 30 January 1971, the ARVN and US forces launched [[Operation Dewey Canyon II]], which involved the reopening of Route 9, securing the Khe Sanh area and reoccupying of KSCB as a forward supply base for [[Operation Lam Son 719]]. On 8 February 1971, the leading ARVN units marched along Route 9 into southern Laos while the US ground forces and advisers were prohibited from entering Laos. US logistical, aerial, and artillery support was provided to the operation.<ref>Hinh, pp. 8\u201312.</ref><ref>Nolan, p. 31.</ref> Following the ARVN defeat in Laos, the newly re-opened KSCB came under attack by PAVN sappers and artillery and the base was abandoned once again on 6 April 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.8th-4th-arty.com/or14.html|title=Operational Report Lessons Learned, Headquarters, 8th Battalion 4th Artillery, Period Ending 30 April 1971 |author=8th Battalion, 4th Artillery |publisher=Department of the Army |date=9 May 1971 |accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.506infantry.org/his2ndbnvnarticle01.html|title=Narrative of Events of Company B, 2nd Battalion, 506th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile) During LAM SON 719 |author=Thies, Donald E. |accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n'''Footnotes'''\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Unpublished government documents'''\n*US Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, ''Command History 1965'', Annex N.

The main US forces defending [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]] (KSCB) were two [[Regiment#United States Marine Corps|regiments]] of the [[United States Marines Corps]] supported by elements from the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), as well as a small number of [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) troops. These were pitted against two to three [[army division|divisional-size]] elements of the [[North Vietnam]]ese [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN).\n\nThe US command in [[Saigon]] initially believed that combat operations around KSCB during 1967 were part of a series of minor PAVN offensives in the border regions. That appraisal was later altered when the PAVN was found to be moving major forces into the area. In response, US forces were built up before the PAVN isolated the Marine base. Once the base came under siege, a series of actions was fought over a period of five months. During this time, KSCB and the hilltop outposts around it were subjected to constant PAVN [[artillery]], mortar, and rocket attacks, and several infantry assaults. To support the Marine base, a massive aerial bombardment campaign ([[Operation Niagara]]) was launched by the USAF. Over 100,000 tons of bombs were dropped by US aircraft and over 158,000 artillery rounds were fired in defense of the base. Throughout the campaign, US forces used the latest technology to locate PAVN forces for targeting. Additionally, the logistical effort required to support the base once it was isolated demanded the implementation of other tactical innovations to keep the Marines supplied.\n\nIn March 1968, an overland relief expedition (Operation Pegasus) was launched by a combined Marine\u2013Army/ARVN task force that eventually broke through to the Marines at Khe Sanh. American commanders considered the defense of Khe Sanh a success, but shortly after the siege was lifted, the decision was made to dismantle the base rather than risk similar battles in the future. On 19 June 1968, the evacuation and destruction of KSCB began. Amid heavy shelling, the Marines attempted to salvage what they could before destroying what remained as they were evacuated. Minor attacks continued before the base was officially closed on 5 July. Marines remained around Hill 689, though, and fighting in the vicinity continued until 11 July until they were finally withdrawn, bringing the battle to a close.\n\nIn the aftermath, the North Vietnamese proclaimed a victory at Khe Sanh, while US forces claimed that they had withdrawn, as the base was no longer required. Historians have observed that the Battle of Khe Sanh may have distracted American and South Vietnamese attention from the buildup of [[Viet Cong]] (VC) forces in the south before the early 1968 [[Tet Offensive]]. Nevertheless, the US commander during the battle, General [[William Westmoreland]], maintained that the true intention of Tet was to distract forces from Khe Sanh.\n\n== Prelude ==\nThe village of Khe Sanh was the seat of government of H\u01b0\u01a1ng Hoa district, an area of Bru [[Degar|Montagnard]] villages and coffee plantations, situated about {{convert|7|mi}} from the Laotian frontier on [[National Road 9 (Vietnam)|Route 9]], the northernmost transverse road in South Vietnam. The badly deteriorated Route 9 ran from the coastal region through the western highlands, and then crossed the border into [[Laos]]. The origin of the combat base lay in the construction by [[United States Army Special Forces|US Army Special Forces]] of an airfield in August 1962 outside the village at an old French fort.<ref>Shulimson, p. 59.</ref> The camp then became a Special Forces outpost of the [[Civilian Irregular Defense Group]]s, whose purpose was to keep watch on PAVN infiltration along the border and to protect the local population.<ref name=Stanton35_48>Stanton, pp. 35\u201348.</ref>{{#tag:ref|For a succinct overview of the creation of the CIDG program and its operations.<ref name=Stanton35_48/>|group=Note}}\n\nJames Marino wrote that in 1964, General Westmoreland, the US commander in Vietnam, had determined, \"Khe Sanh could serve as a patrol base blocking enemy infiltration from Laos; a base for ... operations to harass the enemy in Laos; an airstrip for reconnaissance to survey the Ho Chi Minh Trail; a western anchor for the defenses south of the DMZ; and an eventual jumping-off point for ground operations to cut the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/strategic-crossroads-at-khe-sanh.htm |author=Marino, James I. |title=Strategic Crossroads at Khe Sanh |work=HistoryNet|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref> In November 1964, the Special Forces moved their camp to the Xom Cham Plateau, the future site of Khe Sanh Combat Base.<ref name=BPC131>Boston Publishing Company, p. 131.</ref>\n\n[[File:DMZ1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Map of northern [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]]]]\n\nDuring the winter of 1964, Khe Sanh became the location of a launch site for the highly classified [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam \u2013 Studies and Observations Group]] (the site was first established near the village and was later moved to the French fort).<ref>US Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, ''Command History 1965, Annex N''. Saigon, 1966, p. 18.</ref> From there, reconnaissance teams were launched into Laos to explore and gather intelligence on the PAVN logistical system known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (also known as \"Truong Son Strategic Supply Route\" to the North Vietnamese soldiers).<ref name=BPC131/>\n\nAccording to Marino, \"by 1966, Westmoreland had begun to consider Khe Sanh as part of a larger strategy\". With a view to eventually gaining approval for an advance through Laos to interdict the Ho Chi Minh Trail, he determined, \"it was absolutely essential to hold the base\", and he gave the order for US Marines to take up positions around Khe Sanh. [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] subsequently began planning for incursion into Laos, and in October, construction of an airfield at Khe Sanh was completed.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThe plateau camp was permanently manned by the US Marines during 1967, when they established an outpost next to the airstrip. This base was to serve as the western anchor of Marine Corps forces, which had tactical responsibility for the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam known as [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]].<ref>Prados, pp. 140\u2013146</ref><ref>Dougan, Weiss, et al., p. 42.</ref> The Marines' defensive system stretched below the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) from the coast, along Route 9, to Khe Sanh. During 1966 the regular Special Forces troops had moved off the plateau and built a smaller camp down Route 9 at [[Lang Vei]], about half the distance to the Laotian border.<ref>Shulimson, p. 60.</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n=== Border battles ===\n{{details|Battle of Dak To}}\nDuring the second half of 1967, the North Vietnamese instigated a series of actions in the border regions of South Vietnam. All of these attacks were conducted by regimental-size PAVN/VC units, but unlike the usual hit-and-run tactics used previously, these were sustained and bloody affairs.<ref>Eggleston, pp. 16\u2013122.</ref>\n\nIn early October, the PAVN had intensified battalion-sized ground probes and sustained artillery fire against [[Con Thien]], a hilltop stronghold in the center of the Marines' defensive line south of the DMZ in northern Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province.<ref>Telfer, Rogers, and Fleming, pp. 129\u2013131.</ref> Mortar rounds, artillery shells, and 122&nbsp;mm rockets fell randomly, but incessantly, upon the base. The September bombardments ranged from 100 to 150 rounds per day, with a maximum on 25 September of 1,190 rounds.<ref>Maitland and McInerney, p. 164.</ref> Westmoreland responded by launching Operation Neutralize, an aerial and naval bombardment campaign designed to break the siege. For seven weeks, American aircraft dropped from 35,000 to 40,000 tons of bombs in nearly 4,000 airstrikes.<ref name=\"M&M165\">Maitland and McInerney, p. 165.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hill 875 Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Combat on Hill 875, the most intense of the battles around Dak To]]\n\nOn 27 October, a PAVN regiment attacked an [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) battalion at [[S\u00f4ng B\u00e9 Base Camp|Song Be]], capital of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long Province.<ref name=\"M&M165\"/> The PAVN fought for several days, took casualties, and fell back. Two days later, the PAVN 273rd Regiment attacked a Special Forces camp near the border town of [[First Battle of Loc Ninh|Loc Ninh]], in [[B\u00ecnh Long Province]].<ref name=\"M&M165\"/> Troops of the US [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] were able to respond quickly. After a ten-day battle, the attackers were pushed back into [[Cambodia]]. At least 852 PAVN soldiers were killed during the action, as opposed to 50 American and South Vietnamese dead.<ref name=\"M&M165\"/>\n\nThe heaviest action took place near [[Battle of Dak To|Dak To]], in the central highlands province of Kon Tum. There, the presence of the PAVN [[1st Division (Vietnam)|1st Division]] prompted a 22-day battle that had some of the most intense close-quarters fighting of the entire conflict.<ref>Stanton, pp. 160\u2013169.</ref> American intelligence estimated between 1,200 and 1,600 PAVN troops were killed, while 362 members of the US [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team (United States)|173rd Airborne Brigade]], and ARVN [[Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division|Airborne]] elements were killed in action. Nonetheless, three of the four battalions of the 4th Infantry and the entire 173rd were rendered combat ineffective during the battle.<ref>Maitland and McInerney, p. 183.</ref>\n\nAmerican intelligence analysts were quite baffled by this series of enemy actions. For them, no logic was apparent behind the sustained PAVN/VC offensives, other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time: they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions, and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.<ref>Palmer, pp. 213\u2013215.</ref>\n\n=== Hill fights ===\n{{details|The Hill Fights}}\n[[File:kasa.jpg|thumb|left|The Khe Sanh Valley]]\n\nThings remained quiet in the Khe Sanh area through 1966. Even so, Westmoreland insisted that it not only be occupied by the Marines, but that it also be reinforced.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 432.</ref> He was vociferously opposed by General [[Lewis W. Walt]], the Marine commander of I Corps. Walt argued heatedly that the real target of the American effort should be the pacification and protection of the population, not chasing the PAVN/VC in the hinterlands.<ref>Murphy 2003, pp. 3\u20137, 13\u201314.</ref> Westmoreland won out, however, and the [[1st Battalion, 3rd Marines|1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment]] (1/3 Marines) was dispatched to occupy the camp and airstrip on 29 September. By late January 1967, the 1/3 returned to Japan and was relieved by Bravo Company, [[1st Battalion 9th Marines|1st Battalion, 9th Marines]] (1/9 Marines). A single company was replacing an entire battalion.<ref>Telfer, Rogers, and Fleming, p. 33.</ref>\n\n[[File:KS2.jpg|thumb|The Hill Fights]]\nOn 24 April 1967, a patrol from Bravo Company became engaged with a PAVN force of unknown size north of Hill 861. This action prematurely triggered a PAVN offensive aimed at taking Khe Sanh. The PAVN forces were in the process of gaining elevated terrain before the launching of the main attack.<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 79.</ref> The [[2nd Battalion 3rd Marines|2nd]] and [[3rd Battalion 3rd Marines|3rd Battalions]] of the [[3rd Marine Regiment (United States)|3rd Marine Regiment]], under the command of Colonel John P. Lanigan, reinforced KSCB and were given the task of pushing the PAVN off of Hills 861, 881 North, and 881 South. PAVN forces were driven out of the area around Khe Sanh after suffering 940 casualties. The Marines suffered 155 killed in action and 425 wounded.<ref>Shore, p. 17.</ref> To prevent PAVN observation of the main base at the airfield (and their possible use as firebases), the hills of the surrounding Khe Sanh Valley had to be continuously occupied and defended by separate Marine elements.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 60\u201361.</ref>\n\nIn the wake of the hill fights, a lull in PAVN activity occurred around Khe Sanh. By the end of May, Marine forces were again drawn down from two battalions to one, the [[1st Battalion, 26th Marines]].<ref>Murphy 1997 p. 165.</ref> Lieutenant General [[Robert E. Cushman, Jr.]] relieved Walt as commander of III MAF in June.<ref>Long 2016, p. 125.</ref>\n\nOn 14 August, Colonel [[David E. Lownds]] took over as commander of the [[26th Marine Regiment]]. Sporadic actions were taken in the vicinity during the late summer and early fall, the most serious of which was the ambush of a supply convoy on Route 9. This proved to be the last overland attempt at resupply for Khe Sanh until the following March.<ref>Prados, p. 155.</ref> During December and early January, numerous sightings of PAVN troops and activities were made in the Khe Sanh area, but the sector remained relatively quiet.<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 233.</ref>\n\n=== Decisions ===\nA decision then had to be made by the American high command: either commit more of the limited manpower in I Corps to the defense of Khe Sanh or abandon the base.<ref name=Prados159>Prados and Stubbe, p. 159.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Only nine US battalions were available from Hue/Phu Bai northward.<ref name=Prados159/>|group=Note}} Westmoreland regarded this choice as quite simple. In his memoirs, he listed the reasons for a continued effort<blockquote>Khe Sanh could serve as a patrol base for blocking enemy infiltration from Laos along Route 9; as a base for SOG operations to harass the enemy in Laos; as an airstrip for reconnaissance planes surveying the Ho Chi Minh Trail; as the western anchor for defenses south of the DMZ; and as an eventual jump-off point for ground operations to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail.<ref name=Westmoreland236>Westmoreland, p. 236.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Westmoreland had been forwarding operational plans for an invasion of Laos since 1966. First there had been Operation Full Cry, the original three-division invasion plan. This was superseded by the smaller contingency plans ''Southpaw'' and ''High Port'' (1967). With Operation El Paso the General returned to a three-divisional plan in 1968. Another plan (''York'') envisioned the use of even larger forces.<ref>US Military Assistance Command, Vietnam ''Command History, 1966, Annex M''. Saigon, 1967, p. 60.</ref><ref>Van Staaveren, pp. 230 & 290.</ref>|group=Note}} </blockquote>\n\nLeading Marine officers, however, were not all of the same opinion. Cushman, the new III MAF commander, supported Westmoreland (perhaps wanting to mend Army/Marine relations after the departure of Walt).<ref>Shulimson, p. 67.</ref> Other concerns raised included the assertion that the real danger to I Corps was from a direct threat to [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb]] City and other urban areas; that a defense would be pointless as a threat to infiltration, since PAVN troops could easily bypass Khe Sanh; that the base was too isolated and that the Marines \"had neither the helicopter resources, the troops, nor the logistical bases for such operations\". Additionally, Shore argues that the \"weather was another critical factor because the poor visibility and low overcasts attendant to the monsoon season made such operations hazardous.\"<ref>Shore, p. 47.</ref> Brigadier General Lowell English (assistant commander [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]]) complained that the defense of the isolated outpost was ludicrous. \"When you're at Khe Sanh, you're not really anywhere. You could lose it and you really haven't lost a damn thing.\"<ref name=\"D&W42\">Dougan and Weiss p. 42.</ref>\n\nAs far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all he needed to know was that the PAVN had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the prospect even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.<ref name=\"D&W42\"/>\n\n== Battle ==\n=== Attacks on the perimeter ===\n==== First skirmishes ====\nIn early December 1967, the PAVN appointed Major General [[Tran Quy Hai]] as the local commander for the actions around Khe Sanh, with Le Quang D\u1ea1o as his political commissar. In the coming days, a campaign headquarters was established around Sap Lit.<ref>Clarke, p. 146.</ref> Two divisions, the [[304th Division (Vietnam)|304th]] and the [[325th Division (Vietnam)|325th]], were assigned to the operation: the 325th was given responsibility for the area around the north, while the 304th was given responsibility for the southern sector.<ref>Clarke, p. 46.</ref> In attempting to determine PAVN intentions Marine intelligence confirmed that, within a period of just over a week, the 325th Division had moved into the vicinity of the base and two more divisions were within supporting distance. The 324th Division was located in the DMZ area {{convert|10\u201315|mi}} north of Khe Sanh while the [[320th Division (Vietnam)|320th Division]] was within easy reinforcing distance to the northeast.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 43.</ref> They were supported logistically from the nearby Ho Chi Minh Trail. As a result of this intelligence, KSCB was reinforced on 13 December by the 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment. According to the official PAVN history, by December 1967 the North Vietnamese had in place, or within supporting distance: the 304th, 320th, [[324th Division (Vietnam)|324th]] and 325th Infantry Divisions, the independent 270th infantry Regiment; five artillery regiments (the 16th, 45th, 84th, 204th, and 675th); three [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AAA]] regiments (the 208th, 214th, and 228th); four tank companies; one engineer regiment plus one independent engineer battalion; one signal battalion; and a number of local force units.<ref>Military Institute of Vietnam, p. 216.</ref>\n\n[[File:KhSh9colkey.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Dispositions of opposing forces, January 1968]]\n\nAt positions west of Hill 881 South and north of Co Roc Ridge, across the border in Laos, the PAVN established artillery, rocket, and mortar positions from which to launch attacks by fire on the base and to support its ground operations. The PAVN 130&nbsp;mm and 152&nbsp;mm artillery pieces, and 122&nbsp;mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105&nbsp;mm and 155&nbsp;mm howitzers. This range overmatch was used by the PAVN to avoid [[counter-battery fire]].<ref>Shore, pp. 58\u201359.</ref><ref name=Barry/> They were assisted in their emplacement efforts by the continuing bad weather of the winter monsoon.<ref name=Shore72/>\n\nDuring the rainy night of 2 January 1968, six men dressed in black uniforms were seen outside the defensive wire of the main base by members of a listening post. After failing to respond to a challenge, they were fired upon and five were killed outright while the sixth, although wounded, escaped.{{#tag:ref|A myth has grown up around this incident.

At 00:30 on 21 January, Hill 861 was attacked by about 300 PAVN troops, the Marines, however, were prepared. The PAVN infantry, though bracketed by artillery fire, still managed to penetrate the perimeter of the defenses and were only driven back after severe close-quarters combat.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 258\u2013259.</ref>\n\nThe main base was then subjected to an intense mortar and rocket barrage. Hundreds of mortar rounds and 122-mm rockets slammed into the base, levelling most of the above-ground structures. One of the first enemy shells set off an explosion in the main ammunition dump. Many of the artillery and mortar rounds stored in the dump were thrown into the air and detonated on impact within the base. Soon after, another shell hit a cache of [[tear gas]], which saturated the entire area.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 44.</ref> The fighting and shelling on 21 January resulted in 14 Marines killed and 43 wounded.<ref>Shulimson, p. 261.</ref> Hours after the bombardment ceased, the base was still in danger. At around 10:00, the fire ignited a large quantity of explosives, rocking the base with another series of detonations.<ref>Shulimson, p. 260.</ref>\n\nAt the same time as the artillery bombardment at KSCB, an attack was launched against Khe Sanh village, seat of [[H\u01b0\u1edbng H\u00f3a District]]. The village, 3&nbsp;km south of the base, was defended by 160 local Bru troops, plus 15 American advisers. At dawn of 21 January, it was attacked by a roughly 300-strong PAVN battalion. A platoon from Company D, 1/26 Marines was sent from the base but was withdrawn in the face of the superior PAVN forces. Reinforcements from the ARVN 256th [[South Vietnamese Regional Force|Regional Force]] (RF) company were dispatched aboard nine [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1]] helicopters of the 282nd Assault Helicopter Company, but they were landed near the abandoned French fort/former FOB-3 which was occupied by the PAVN who killed many of the RF troops and 4 Americans, including Lieutenant colonel Joseph Seymoe the deputy adviser for Quang Tri Province and forcing the remaining helicopters to abandon the mission. On the morning of 22 January Lownds decided to evacuate the remaining forces in the village with most of the Americans evacuated by helicopter while two advisers led the surviving local forces overland to the combat base.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=http://www.vva.org/veteran/0807/khesanh.html|title=Khe Sanh: The Other Side Of The Hill |author=Prados, John |work=The VVA Veteran |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706021028/http://www.vva.org/veteran/0807/khesanh.html|archivedate=6 July 2014}}</ref><ref>Shulimson, p. 261-4.</ref>\n\nTo eliminate any threat to their flank, the PAVN attacked Laotian Battalion BV-33, located at [[Ban Houei Sane]], on Route 9 in Laos. The battalion was assaulted on the night of 23 January by three PAVN battalions supported by seven tanks. The Laotians were overrun, and many fled to the Special Forces camp at Lang Vei. The [[Battle of Ban Houei Sane]], not the attack three weeks later at Lang Vei, marked the first time that the PAVN had committed an armored unit to battle.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\nPAVN artillery fell on the main base for the first time on 21 January.

Five days later, the final reinforcements arrived in the form of the [[ARVN Rangers|37th ARVN Ranger Battalion]], which was deployed more for political than tactical reasons.<ref name=\"Shulimson, p. 269\">Shulimson, p. 269.</ref> The Marines and ARVN dug in and hoped that the approaching [[T\u1ebft]] truce (scheduled for 29\u201331 January) would provide some respite.

The Tet Offensive was about to begin.<ref>Nalty, p. 107.</ref><ref>Shulimson, p. 270.</ref>\n\n==== Westmoreland's plan to use nuclear weapons ====\nNine days before the Tet Offensive broke out, the PAVN opened the battle of Khe Sanh and attacked the US forces just south of the DMZ. Declassified documents show that in response, Westmoreland considered using nuclear weapons. In 1970, the Office of Air Force History published a then \"top secret\", but now declassified, 106-page report, titled ''The Air Force in Southeast Asia: Toward a Bombing Halt, 1968''. Journalist Richard Ehrlich writes that according to the report, \"in late January, General Westmoreland had warned that if the situation near the DMZ and at Khe Sanh worsened drastically, nuclear or chemical weapons might have to be used.\" The report continues to state, \"this prompted Air Force chief of staff, General John McConnell, to press, although unsuccessfully, for JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff) authority to request Pacific Command to prepare a plan for using low-yield nuclear weapons to prevent a catastrophic loss of the U.S. Marine base.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JD17Ae01.html|title=The US's secret plan to nuke Vietnam, Laos |first= Richard|last= Ehrlich|website=Asia Times |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, ultimately the nuclear option was discounted by military planners. A secret memorandum reported by US Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], sent to US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on 19 February 1968, was declassified in 2005. It reveals that the nuclear option was discounted because of terrain considerations that were unique to South Vietnam, which would have reduced the effectiveness of tactical nuclear weapons. McNamara wrote: \"because of terrain and other conditions peculiar to our operations in South Vietnam, it is inconceivable that the use of nuclear weapons would be recommended there against either Viet Cong or North Vietnamese forces\". McNamara's thinking may have also been affected by his aide David Morrisroe (later VP at Cal Tech where McNamara later served as Trustee), whose brother Michael Morrisroe (1960 New York State Chess Champion) was serving at the base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www103.pair.com/adsd/khe-sanh/nukes/j021968a.jpg |title=Memorandum for the President, 19 February 1968 |last=McNamara |first=Robert |work=Khe Sanh Declassified Documents |accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Operation Niagara ====\n{{details|topic=the bombing campaign|Operation Niagara}}\n{{details|topic=the electronic sensor system|Operation Igloo White}}\nDuring January, the recently installed electronic sensors of [[Operation Igloo White|Operation Muscle Shoals]] (later renamed \"Igloo White\"), which were undergoing test and evaluation in southeastern Laos, were alerted by a flurry of PAVN activity along the Ho Chi Minh Trail opposite the northwestern corner of South Vietnam. Due to the nature of these activities, and the threat that they posed to KSCB, Westmoreland ordered Operation Niagara I, an intense intelligence collection effort on PAVN activities in the vicinity of the Khe Sanh Valley.<ref name=autogenerated3>Van Staaveren, p. 290.</ref>\n\n[[File:IW2.jpg|thumb|US Navy OP-2E Neptune of VO-67, a variant of a naval patrol bomber and antisubmarine warfare aircraft specifically developed for the Muscle Shoals mission]]\nNiagara I was completed during the third week of January, and the next phase, Niagara II, was launched on the 21st,<ref>Pearson, p. 35.</ref> the day of the first PAVN artillery barrage.<ref name=Shulimson260_261/> The Marine [[Direct Air Support Center]] (DASC), located at KSCB, was responsible for the coordination of air strikes with artillery fire.

Momyer]], the responsibility for coordinating all air assets during the operation to support KSCB. This caused problems for the Marine command, which possessed its own aviation squadrons that operated under their own close air support doctrine. The Marines were extremely reluctant to relinquish authority over their aircraft to an Air Force general.<ref>Prados, pp. 295\u2013297.</ref> The command and control arrangement then in place in Southeast Asia went against Air Force doctrine, which was predicated on the single air manager concept. One headquarters would allocate and coordinate all air assets, distributing them wherever they were considered most necessary, and then transferring them as the situation required. The Marines, whose aircraft and doctrine were integral to their operations, were under no such centralized control. On 18 January, Westmoreland passed his request for Air Force control up the chain of command to [[United States Pacific Command|CINCPAC]] in Honolulu.<ref>Nalty, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nHeated debate arose among Westmoreland, [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] [[Leonard F. Chapman, Jr.]], and Army Chief of Staff [[Harold K. Johnson]]. Johnson backed the Marine position due to his concern over protecting the Army's air assets from Air Force co-option.<ref>Prados, p. 223.</ref> Westmoreland was so obsessed with the tactical situation that he threatened to resign if his wishes were not obeyed.<ref>Prados, p. 295.</ref> As a result, on 7 March, for the first time during the Vietnam War, air operations were placed under the control of a single manager.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Westmoreland insisted for several months that the entire Tet Offensive was a diversion, including, famously, attacks on downtown Saigon and obsessively affirming that the true objective of the North Vietnamese was Khe Sanh.<ref>Donaldson, p. 115.</ref>\n\n==== Fall of Lang Vei ====\n{{main|Battle of Lang Vei}}\nThe Tet Offensive was launched prematurely in some areas on 30 January. On the following night, a massive wave of PAVN/VC attacks swept throughout South Vietnam, everywhere except Khe Sanh. The launching of the largest enemy offensive thus far in the conflict did not shift Westmoreland's focus away from Khe Sanh. A press release prepared on the following day (but never issued), at the height of Tet, showed that he was not about to be distracted. \"The enemy is attempting to confuse the issue&nbsp;... I suspect he is also trying to draw everyone's attention away from the greatest area of threat, the northern part of I Corps. Let me caution everyone not to be confused.\"<ref>Prados, p. 286.</ref><ref>Pisor, p. 152.</ref>\n\nNot much activity (with the exception of patrolling) had occurred thus far during the battle for the Special Forces of Detachment A-101 and their four companies of Bru CIDGs stationed at Lang Vei. Then, on the morning of 6 February, the PAVN fired mortars into the Lang Vei compound, wounding eight Camp Strike Force soldiers.<ref name=Pike35>Pike 2013, p. 35.</ref> At 18:10 hours, the PAVN followed up their morning mortar attack with an artillery strike from 152&nbsp;mm howitzers, firing 60 rounds into the camp. The strike wounded two more Strike Force soldiers and damaged two bunkers.<ref name=Pike35/>\n\nThe situation changed radically during the early morning hours of 7 February. The Americans had forewarning of PAVN armor in the area from Laotian refugees from camp BV-33. SOG Reconnaissance teams also reported finding tank tracks in the area surrounding Co Roc mountain.<ref>Plaster, p. 154</ref> Although the PAVN was known to possess two armored regiments, it had not yet fielded an armored unit in South Vietnam, and besides, the Americans considered it impossible for them to get one down to Khe Sanh without it being spotted by aerial reconnaissance.<ref>Prados, pp. 319\u2013320.</ref>\n\nIt still came as a shock to the Special Forces troopers at Lang Vei when 12 tanks attacked their camp. The Soviet-built [[PT-76]] amphibious tanks of the 203rd Armored Regiment churned over the defenses, backed up by an infantry assault by the 7th Battalion, 66th Regiment and the 4th Battalion of the 24th Regiment, both elements of the 304th Division. The ground troops had been specially equipped for the attack with satchel charges, tear gas, and flame throwers. Although the camp's main defenses were overrun in only 13 minutes, the fighting lasted for several hours, during which the Special Forces men and Bru CIDGs managed to knock out at least five of the tanks.<ref>Prados, p. 329.</ref>\n\nThe Marines at Khe Sanh had a plan in place for providing a ground relief force in just such a contingency, but Lownds, fearing a PAVN ambush, refused to implement it. Lownds also rejected a proposal to launch a helicopter extraction of the survivors.<ref name=Shulimson276>Shulimson, p. 276.</ref> During a meeting at Da Nang at 07:00 the next morning, Westmoreland and Cushman accepted Lownds' decision. Army Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Ladd (commander, [[5th Special Forces Group]]), who had just flown in from Khe Sanh, was reportedly, \"astounded that the Marines, who prided themselves on leaving no man behind, were willing to write off all of the Green Berets and simply ignore the fall of Lang Vei.\"<ref name=Shulimson276/>\n\n[[File:Khe Sanh Lang Vei SF-Camp Map.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|Attack on Lang Vei]]\n\nLadd and the commander of the SOG compound (whose men and camp had been incorporated into the defenses of KSCB) proposed that, if the Marines would provide the helicopters, the SOG reconnaissance men would go in themselves to pick up any survivors.<ref>Prados, pp. 332\u2013333.</ref> The Marines continued to oppose the operation until Westmoreland actually had to issue an order to Cushman to allow the rescue operation to proceed.<ref>Prados, p. 333.</ref> The relief effort was not launched until 15:00, and it was successful. Of the 500 CIDG troops at Lang Vei, 200 had been killed or were missing and 75 more were wounded. Of the 24 Americans at the camp, 10 had been killed and 11 wounded.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 47.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The official North Vietnamese history claimed that 400 South Vietnamese troops had been killed and 253 captured. It claimed, however, that only three American advisors were killed during the action.<ref>Military History Institute of Vietnam, p. 222.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nLownds infuriated the Special Forces personnel even further when the indigenous survivors of Lang Vei, their families, civilian refugees from the area, and Laotian survivors from the camp at Ban Houei Sane arrived at the gate of KSCB. Lownds feared that PAVN infiltrators were mixed up in the crowd of more than 6,000, and lacked sufficient resources to sustain them. Overnight, they were moved to a temporary position a short distance from the perimeter and from there, some of the Laotians were eventually evacuated, although the majority turned around and walked back down Route 9 toward Laos.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 276\u2013277.</ref>\n\nThe Lao troops were eventually flown back to their homeland, but not before the Laotian regional commander remarked that his army had to \"consider the South Vietnamese as enemy because of their conduct.\"<ref>Prados, p. 338.</ref> The Bru were excluded from evacuation from the highlands by an order from the ARVN I Corps commander, who ruled that no Bru be allowed to move into the lowlands.<ref>Prados, p. 340.</ref> Ladd, back on the scene, reported that the Marines stated, \"they couldn't trust any gooks in their damn camp.\"<ref name=Shulimson277>Shulimson, p. 277.</ref> There had been a history of distrust between the Special Forces personnel and the Marines, and General [[Rathvon M. Tompkins]], commander of the 3rd Marine Division, described the Special Forces soldiers as \"hopped up&nbsp;... wretches&nbsp;... [who] were a law unto themselves.\"<ref>Pisor, p. 76.</ref> At the end of January, Tompkins had ordered that no Marine patrols proceed more than 500 meters from the Combat Base.<ref name=\"Shulimson, p. 269\"/> Regardless, the SOG reconnaissance teams kept patrolling, providing the only human intelligence available in the battle area. This, however, did not prevent the Marine tanks within the perimeter from training their guns on the SOG camp.<ref name=Shulimson277/>\n\n==== Logistics and supporting fire ====\nLownds estimated that the logistical requirements of KSCB were 60 tons per day in mid-January and rose to 185 tons per day when all five battalions were in place.<ref>Shore, p. 90.</ref> The greatest impediments to the delivery of supplies to the base were the closure of Route 9 and the winter monsoon weather. For most of the battle, low-lying clouds and fog enclosed the area from early morning until around noon, and poor visibility severely hampered aerial resupply.<ref name=Shore72>Shore, p. 72.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe Sanh LAPES C-130.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|A C-130 delivering supplies with LAPES]]\n\nMaking matters worse for the defenders, any aircraft that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to PAVN antiaircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of PAVN artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then had to contend with antiaircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65% of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the USAF, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 49.</ref> The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the [[Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System]], in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The pallet slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land.<ref name=Barry>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/air-power-in-the-siege-of-khe-sanh.htm |title=Air Power in the Siege of Khe Sanh |work=HistoryNet |author=Barry, William A. |accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> The USAF delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop).

The fire of PAVN antiaircraft units took its toll of helicopters that made the attempt. The Marines found a solution to the problem in the \"Super Gaggle\" concept. A group of 12 [[A-4 Skyhawk]] fighter-bombers provided flak suppression for massed flights of 12\u201316 helicopters, which would resupply the hills simultaneously. The adoption of this concept at the end of February was the turning point in the resupply effort. After its adoption, Marine helicopters flew in 465 tons of supplies during February. When the weather later cleared in March, the amount was increased to 40 tons per day.<ref>Shore, p. 89.</ref>\n\nAs more infantry units had been assigned to defend KSCB, artillery reinforcement kept pace. By early January, the defenders could count on fire support from 46 artillery pieces of various calibers, five tanks armed with 90-mm guns, and 92 single or [[Ontos]]-mounted 106-mm recoilless rifles.<ref>Shore, p. 33.</ref> The base could also depend on fire support from US Army 175-mm guns located at [[Camp Carroll]], east of Khe Sanh.

At 04:15 on 8 February under cover of fog and a mortar barrage, the PAVN penetrated the perimeter, overrunning most of the position and pushing the remaining 30 defenders into the southwestern portion of the defenses. For some unknown reason, the PAVN troops did not press their advantage and eliminate the pocket, instead throwing a steady stream of grenades at the Marines.<ref name=\"Shulimson277\"/> At 07:40, a relief force from Company A, 2nd Platoon set out from the main base and attacked through the PAVN, pushing them into supporting tank and artillery fire.<ref>Prados, p. 348.</ref> By 11:00, the battle was over, Company A had lost 24 dead and 27 wounded, while 150 PAVN bodies were found around the position, which was then abandoned.<ref>Shulimson, p.278.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe-Sanh-Web.gif|thumb|The Khe Sanh perimeter, 28 February 1968: A white dotted line indicates a PAVN trench just 200 m from 37th ARVN Rangers along the southern perimeter of Khe Sanh.]]\n\nOn 23 February, KSCB received its worst bombardment of the entire battle. During one 8-hour period, the base was rocked by 1,307 rounds, most of which came from [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|130-mm]] (used for the first time on the battlefield) and 152-mm artillery pieces located in Laos.<ref>Shulimson, p. 279.</ref> Casualties from the bombardment were 10 killed and 51 wounded.

The Marines pursued three enemy scouts, who led them into an ambush. The platoon withdrew following a three-hour battle that left six Marines dead, 24 missing, and one taken prisoner.<ref name=Shulimson279_280/>\n\n[[File:M107 Firing Vietnam 2.jpg|thumb|left|An Army 175-mm M107 at Camp Carroll provides fire support for ground forces]]\n[[File:Marine Corps sniper team, Khe Sanh Valley.jpg|thumb|left|Marine Corps sniper team searches for targets in the Khe Sanh Valley]]\n\nIn late February, ground sensors detected the 66th Regiment, 304th Division preparing to mount an attack on the positions of the 37th ARVN Ranger Battalion on the eastern perimeter.<ref name=Shulimson281>Shulimson, p. 281.</ref> On the night of 28 February, the combat base unleashed artillery and airstrikes on possible PAVN staging areas and routes of advance. At 21:30, the attack came on, but it was stifled by the small arms of the Rangers, who were supported by thousands of artillery rounds and air strikes. Two further attacks later in the morning were halted before the PAVN finally withdrew. The PAVN, however, were not through with the ARVN troops. Five more attacks against their sector were launched during March.<ref name=Shulimson281/>\n\nBy mid-March, Marine intelligence began to note an exodus of PAVN units from the Khe Sanh sector.<ref name=Shulimson281/> The 325C Divisional Headquarters was the first to leave, followed by the 95C and 101D Regiments, all of which relocated to the west. At the same time, the 304th Division withdrew to the southwest. That did not mean, however, that battle was over. On 22 March, over 1,000 North Vietnamese rounds fell on the base, and once again, the ammunition dump was detonated.<ref>Shulimson, p. 282.</ref>\n\nOn 30 March, Bravo Company, 26th Marines, launched an attack toward the location of the ambush that had claimed so many of their comrades on 25 February. Following a rolling barrage fired by nine artillery batteries, the Marine attack advanced through two PAVN trenchlines, but the Marines failed to locate the remains of the men of the ambushed patrol. The Marines claimed 115 PAVN killed, while their own casualties amounted to 10 dead, 100 wounded, and two missing.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 282\u2013283.</ref> At 08:00 the following day, Operation Scotland was officially terminated.

He subsequently ordered the US military to hold Khe Sanh at all costs. As a result, \"B-52 [[Operation Arc Light|Arc Light strikes]] originating in Guam, Okinawa, and Thailand bombed the jungles surrounding Khe Sanh into stubble fields\" and Khe Sanh became the major news headline coming out of Vietnam in late March 1968.<ref>Johnson, Chapter 18.</ref>\n\n=== Relief and retreat from Khe Sanh ===\n==== Operation Pegasus (1\u201314 April 1968) ====\nPlanning for the overland relief of Khe Sanh had begun as early as 25 January 1968, when Westmoreland ordered General [[John J. Tolson]], commander, First Cavalry Division, to prepare a contingency plan. Route 9, the only practical overland route from the east, was impassable due to its poor state of repair and the presence of PAVN troops. Tolson was not happy with the assignment, since he believed that the best course of action, after Tet, was to use his division in an attack into the [[A Shau Valley]]. Westmoreland, however, was already planning ahead. Khe Sanh would be relieved and then used as the jump-off point for a \"hot pursuit\" of enemy forces into Laos.<ref>Prados, pp. 418\u2013420.</ref>\n\nOn 2 March, Tolson laid out what became known as Operation Pegasus, the operational plan for what was to become the largest operation launched by III MAF thus far in the conflict. The [[2nd Battalion 1st Marines|2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment]] (2/1 Marines) and the 2/3 Marines would launch a ground assault from [[Ca Lu Combat Base]] (16&nbsp;km east of Khe Sanh) and head west on Route 9 while the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Brigades of the 1st Cavalry Division, would air-assault key terrain features along Route 9 to establish fire support bases and cover the Marine advance. The advance would be supported by 102 pieces of artillery.<ref>Prados, p. 428.</ref> The Marines would be accompanied by their 11th Engineer Battalion, which would repair the road as the advance moved forward. Later, the 1/1 Marines and 3rd ARVN Airborne Task Force (the 3rd, 6th, and 8th Airborne Battalions) would join the operation.<ref>Prados, p. 419.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe Sanh Operation Pegasus First Cavalry.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division moving towards Khe Sanh Combat Base during Operation Pegasus]]\n\nWestmoreland's planned relief effort infuriated the Marines, who had not wanted to hold Khe Sanh in the first place and who had been roundly criticized for not defending it well.<ref>Murphy 2003, pp. 239\u2013240. See also Pisor, p. 108.</ref> The Marines had constantly argued that technically, Khe Sanh had never been under siege, since it had never truly been isolated from resupply or reinforcement. Cushman was appalled by the \"implication of a rescue or breaking of the siege by outside forces.\"<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 240.</ref>\n\nRegardless, on 1 April, Operation Pegasus began.<ref>Shulimson, p. 284.</ref> Opposition from the North Vietnamese was light and the primary problem that hampered the advance was continual heavy morning cloud cover that slowed the pace of helicopter operations. As the relief force made progress, the Marines at Khe Sanh moved out from their positions and began patrolling at greater distances from the base. Things heated up for the air cavalrymen on 6 April, when the 3rd Brigade encountered a PAVN blocking force and fought a day-long engagement.<ref name=Shulimson287>Shulimson, p. 287.</ref>\n\nOn the following day, the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Air Cavalry captured the old French fort near Khe Sanh village after a three-day battle. The link-up between the relief force and the Marines at KSCB took place at 08:00 on 8 April, when the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment entered the camp.<ref>Shulimson, p. 286.</ref> The 11th Engineers proclaimed Route 9 open to traffic on 11 April. On that day, Tolson ordered his unit to immediately make preparations for [[Operation Delaware]], an air assault into the A Shau Valley.<ref name=Shulimson287/> At 08:00 on 15 April, Operation Pegasus was officially terminated.<ref name=\"Shulimson, p. 289\">Shulimson, p. 289.</ref> Total US casualties during the operation were 92 killed, 667 wounded, and five missing. Thirty-three ARVN troops were also killed and 187 were wounded.<ref>Sigler, p. 72.</ref> Because of the close proximity of the enemy and their high concentration, the massive B-52 bombings, tactical airstrikes, and vast use of artillery, PAVN casualties were estimated by MACV as being between 10,000 and 15,000 men.<ref>Tucker 1998, p. 340.</ref>\n\nLownds and the 26th Marines departed Khe Sanh, leaving the defense of the base to the 1st Marine Regiment. He made his final appearance in the story of Khe Sanh on 23 May, when his regimental sergeant major and he stood before President Johnson and were presented with a [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] on behalf of the 26th Marines.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 287\u2013289.</ref><ref>Jones, Chapters 21 & 22.</ref>\n\n==== Operation Scotland II ====\n{{main|Operation Scotland II}}\nOn 15 April, the 3rd Marine Division resumed responsibility for KSCB, Operation Pegasus ended, and Operation Scotland II began with the Marines seeking out the PAVN in the surrounding area.<ref name=\"Shulimson, p. 289\"/> Operation Scotland II would continue until 28 February 1969 resulting in 435 Marines and 3304 PAVN killed.<ref name=Smith>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Charles|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: High Mobility and Standdown 1969|publisher=History and Museums Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps|url=https://archive.org/details/HighMobilityAndStanddown|year=1988|isbn=9781494287627|page=[https://archive.org/details/HighMobilityAndStanddown/page/n37 23]}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Peter Brush details that an \"additional 413 Marines were killed during Scotland II through the end of June 1968\".<ref name=autogenerated10 /> He goes on to state that a further 72 were killed as part Operation Scotland II throughout the remainder of the year, but that these deaths are not included in the official US casualty lists for the Battle of Khe Sanh. Twenty-five USAF personnel who were killed are also not included.<ref name=autogenerated10 />\n\n==== Operation Charlie: evacuation of the base ====\n[[File:3.4 Marines memorial service at Khe Sanh Combat Base.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|3/4 Marines memorial service at the base]]\n\nThe evacuation of Khe Sanh began on 19 June 1968 as Operation Charlie.<ref>Shulimson, p. 324.</ref> Useful equipment was withdrawn or destroyed, and personnel were evacuated. A limited attack was made by a PAVN company on 1 July, falling on a company from the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines, who were holding a position 3&nbsp;km to the southeast of the base. Casualties were heavy among the attacking PAVN, who lost over 200 killed, while the defending Marines lost two men.<ref>Shulimson, p. 326.</ref> The official closure of the base came on 5 July after fighting, which had killed five more Marines. The withdrawal of the last Marines under the cover of darkness was hampered by the shelling of a bridge along Route 9, which had to be repaired before the withdrawal could be completed.<ref name=\"historynet_a\"/>\n\nFollowing the closure of the base, a small force of Marines remained around Hill 689 carrying out mopping-up operations.<ref name=\"historynet_a\"/>  Further fighting followed, resulting in the loss of another 11 Marines and 89 PAVN soldiers, before the Marines finally withdrew from the area on 11 July.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> According to Brush, it was \"the only occasion in which Americans abandoned a major combat base due to enemy pressure\" and in the aftermath, the North Vietnamese began a strong propaganda campaign, seeking to exploit the US withdrawal and to promote the message that the withdrawal had not been by choice.<ref name=autogenerated10 />\n\nRegardless, the PAVN had gained control of a strategically important area, and its lines of communication extended further into South Vietnam.<ref name=Rottman90/>  Once the news of the closure of KSCB was announced, the American media immediately raised questions about the reasoning behind its abandonment. They asked what had changed in six months so that American commanders were willing to abandon Khe Sanh in July. The explanations given out by the Saigon command were that \"the enemy had changed his tactics and reduced his forces; that PAVN had carved out new infiltration routes; that the Marines now had enough troops and helicopters to carry out mobile operations; that a fixed base was no longer necessary.\"<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 54.</ref>\n\nWhile KSCB was abandoned, the Marines continued to patrol the Khe Sanh plateau, including reoccupying the area with ARVN forces from 5\u201319 October 1968 with minimal opposition.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 409\u2013410.</ref> On 31 December 1968, the [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] was landed west of Khe Sanh to commence [[Operation Dawson River West]], on 2 January 1969 the 9th Marines and 2nd ARVN Regiment were also deployed on the plateau supported by the newly established Fire Support Bases Geiger and Smith; the 3-week operation found no significant PAVN forces or supplies in the Khe Sanh area.<ref>Smith, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> From 12 June to 6 July 1969, ''Task Force Guadalcanal'' comprising 1/9 Marines, [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment]] and 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 2nd ARVN Regiment occupied the Khe Sanh area in [[Operation Utah Mesa]].<ref>Smith, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> The Marines occupied [[Hill 950]] overlooking the Khe Sanh plateau from 1966 until September 1969 when control was handed to the Army who used the position as a SOG operations and support base until it was overrun by the PAVN in June 1971.<ref>Smith, p. 152.</ref><ref>Long 2013, pp. 355\u2013362.</ref> The gradual withdrawal of US forces began during 1969 and the adoption of [[Vietnamization]] meant that, by 1969, \"although limited tactical offensives abounded, US military participation in the war would soon be relegated to a defensive stance.\"<ref>Stanton, p. 246.</ref>\n\nAccording to military historian [[Ronald Spector]], to reasonably record the fighting at Khe Sanh as an American victory is impossible.<ref name=\"historynet_a\"/> With the abandonment of the base, according to Thomas Ricks, \"Khe Sanh became etched in the minds of many Americans as a symbol of the pointless sacrifice and muddled tactics that permeated a doomed U.S. war effort in Vietnam\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/05/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-khe-sanh/|title=5 things you didn't know about Khe Sanh |author=Ricks, Thomas E. |date=5 June 2014|website=FP |access-date=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n=== Termination of the McNamara Line ===\nCommencing in 1966, the US had attempted to establish a barrier system across the DMZ to prevent infiltration by North Vietnamese troops. Known as the [[McNamara Line]], it was initially codenamed \"Project Nine\" before being renamed \"Dye Marker\" by MACV in September 1967. This occurred just as the PAVN began the first phase of their offensive, launching attacks against Marine-held positions across the DMZ. These attacks hindered the advancement of the McNamara Line, and as the fighting around Khe Sanh intensified, vital equipment including sensors and other hardware had to be diverted from elsewhere to meet the needs of the US garrison at Khe Sanh. Construction on the line was ultimately abandoned and resources were later diverted towards implementing a more mobile strategy.<ref name=autogenerated8 />\n\n=== Assessment ===\nThe precise nature of Hanoi's strategic goal at Khe Sanh is regarded as one of the most intriguing unanswered questions of the Vietnam War. According to Gordon Rottman, even the North Vietnamese official history, ''Victory in Vietnam'', is largely silent on the issue.<ref>Rottman, Opposing plans.</ref> This question, known among American historians as the \"riddle of Khe Sanh\" has been summed up by John Prados and Ray Stubbe: \"Either the Tet Offensive was a diversion intended to facilitate PAVN/VC preparations for a war-winning battle at Khe Sanh, or Khe Sanh was a diversion to mesmerize Westmoreland in the days before Tet.\"<ref>Prados, p. 173.</ref> In assessing North Vietnamese intentions, Peter Brush cites the Vietnamese theater commander, [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]]'s claim \"that Khe Sanh itself was not of importance, but only a diversion to draw U.S. forces away from the populated areas of South Vietnam\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/BattleKheSanh1968.htm |title=The Battle of Khe Sanh |author=Brush, Peter |accessdate=10 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716230121/http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/BattleKheSanh1968.htm |archivedate=16 July 2012  }}</ref> This has led other observers to conclude that the siege served a wider PAVN strategy; it diverted 30,000 US troops away from the cities that were the main targets of the Tet Offensive.<ref>Page and Pimlott, p. 324.</ref>\n\nWhether the PAVN actually planned to capture Khe Sanh and whether the battle was an attempt to replicate the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] triumph against the French at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu has long been a point of contention. Westmoreland believed that the latter was the case and this belief was the basis for his desire to stage \"Dien Bien Phu in reverse\".<ref>Pisor, p. 61.</ref> Those who agree with Westmoreland reason that no other explanation exists as to why Hanoi would have committed so many forces to the area instead of deploying them for the Tet Offensive. The fact that the North Vietnamese only committed about half of their available forces to the offensive (60\u201370,000), the majority of whom were VC, is cited in favor of Westmoreland's argument. Other theories argued that the forces around Khe Sanh were simply a localized defensive measure in the DMZ area, or that they were serving as a reserve in case of an offensive American end run in the mode of the American [[Battle of Inchon|invasion at Inchon]] during the [[Korean War]]. However, North Vietnamese sources claim that the Americans did not win a victory at Khe Sanh, but they were forced to retreat to avoid destruction. The PAVN claimed that Khe Sanh was \"a stinging defeat from both the military and political points of view\": Westmoreland was replaced two months after the end of the battle and his successor explained the retreat in different ways.<ref name=\"historynet_a\" />\n\n[[File:Wallace Greene, Robert Cushman and William Westmoreland.jpg|thumb|left|General Wallace Greene, Commandant of the Marine Corps (l), Lieutenant General Robert Cushman, III MAF Commander (c), and General William Westmoreland (r)]]\n\nGeneral [[Creighton Abrams]] has also suggested that the North Vietnamese may have been planning to emulate Dien Bien Phu. He believed that the PAVN's actions during Tet proved it.<ref>Warren, p. 333.</ref> He cited the fact that it would have taken longer to [[Battle of Hu\u1ebf|dislodge the North Vietnamese at Hue]] if the PAVN had committed the three divisions at Khe Sanh to the battle there (although the PAVN did commit three regiments to the fighting from the Khe Sanh sector), instead of dividing their forces.<ref>Dougan and Weiss, p. 38.</ref>\n\nAnother interpretation was that the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy has come to be known as the Option Play. If the PAVN could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive.<ref>Pisor, p. 210.</ref> This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the PAVN would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but the price they were willing to pay had limits. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.<ref>Shulimson, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that the actions around Khe Sanh (and the other border battles) were simply a feint, a ruse meant to focus American attention (and forces) on the border. General and historian Dave Palmer accepts this rationale: \"General Giap never had any intention of capturing Khe Sanh&nbsp;... [it] was a feint, a diversionary effort. And it had accomplished its purpose magnificently.\"<ref>Palmer, p. 219.</ref>{{#tag:ref|This is also the position taken in the official PAVN history, but which offers no further explanation of the strategy.<ref>Military History Institute of Vietnam, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nMarine General Rathvon M. Tompkins, commander of the 3rd Marine Division, has pointed out that had the PAVN actually intended to take Khe Sanh, PAVN troops could have cut the base's sole source of water, a stream 500 m outside the perimeter of the base. Had they simply contaminated the stream, the airlift would not have provided enough water to the Marines.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Marine Lieutenant General [[Victor Krulak]] seconded the notion that there was never a serious intention to take the base by also arguing that neither the water supply nor the telephone land lines were ever cut by the PAVN.<ref>Krulak, p. 218.</ref><ref>Shulimson p. 289.</ref>\n\n[[File:Khe Sahn airstrip looking west.JPG|thumb|right|Khe Sanh airstrip, December 2006]]\n\nOne argument leveled by Westmoreland at the time (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several PAVN divisions.<ref>Pisor, p. 240.</ref> At the time Hanoi made the decision to move in around the base, though, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. Whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four PAVN divisions was debatable. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops\u2014nearly 50 maneuver battalions\u2014to I Corps.<ref>Murphy 2003, p. 235.</ref><br />\n\n=== Use during Operation Lam Son 719 ===\nOn 30 January 1971, the ARVN and US forces launched [[Operation Dewey Canyon II]], which involved the reopening of Route 9, securing the Khe Sanh area and reoccupying of KSCB as a forward supply base for [[Operation Lam Son 719]]. On 8 February 1971, the leading ARVN units marched along Route 9 into southern Laos while the US ground forces and advisers were prohibited from entering Laos.

executive. He serves as the general manager of the Cali Condors a part of the [[International Swimming League]]. He is a former American competition swimmer representing team USA in four [[Olympic games]] winning a total of eight medals including four gold.\n\nJason grew up in [[Irvine, California]] as a well-rounded athlete. He began swimming at the age of five, played on the high school basketball team, and became a high school All-American in water polo. Early in his career it was noticeable that Jason excelled and enjoyed being a part of relays. Currently his performance on the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay]] at the the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] is still the fastest relay split in history. Jason credits his background in team sports as a big part in his relay success. \n\nAs a proud husband and father, highly respected athlete and executive, Jason has become an inspiration to a wide variety of audiences. He successfully balances his family and business life with motivating others and sharing his stories.\n\n==Executive career==\nLezak serves as the general manager for the Cali Condors a part of the [[International Swimming League]]. In the first year of the league in 2019 the Condors finished 3rd place in the finals. In the off season he has continued to improve his team with some great additions looking to win the championship in 2020.\n\n==Swimming career==\n\n===Olympics===\nLezak has competed in four Olympic Games, in [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], and [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]], and has won eight Olympic medals; two bronze, two silver, and four gold.  \n\n====2000 Olympics====\nLezak earned his first long-course international swimming gold medal at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney, where he was part of the [[Swimming at the 2000 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metre medley relay|4\u00d7100-meter medley relay]] in the Olympics in Sydney. He also won a silver medal in the [[Swimming at the 2000 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay]].\n\n====2004 Olympics====\nLezak competed in several events at the [[2004 Olympic Games]] in Athens, Greece, and was a member of the [[Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metre medley relay|4\u00d7100-meter medley relay]] team that set a new world record and earned another gold medal at the games. Lezak also won a bronze medal in the [[Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay]] and finished fifth in the [[Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 50 metre freestyle|50-meter freestyle]].\n\n====2008 Olympics====\nAt the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing, Lezak was the oldest male and team captain of the U.S. swim team.  He anchored the U.S. [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay]] team that won the gold medal and set a new world record. In the final 25 meters, Lezak overtook French team anchor [[Alain Bernard]] (the world record holder in the 100-meter freestyle going into the relay) to win gold despite Bernard having nearly a full body length's advantage when Lezak started his leg and half a body length 25 meters from the end. Lezak split a 46.06, the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in history by nearly six-tenths of a second (It is the fastest by 0.08 seconds now, Duncan Scott swam a 46.14s split in the 2019 World Championships 4x100 medley relay). The final time of the American team was 3:08:24, which was 3.99 seconds faster than the previous world record; the French team finished second at 3:08.32, eight one-hundredths (0.08) of a second behind\u2014the closest finish in the event's history. This was a crucial race for [[Michael Phelps]], because he needed it to complete the goal of winning eight gold medals in a single Olympic Games, breaking [[Mark Spitz]]'s record of seven gold medals at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=\"yahoo_reuters\">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080807/sp_nm/olympics_swimming_bernard_dc |title=I'm favorite and we'll smash U.S.: Bernard |accessdate=August 11, 2008 |publisher=Reuters |date=August 7, 2008 |author=Francois Thomazeau |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817202914/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080807/sp_nm/olympics_swimming_bernard_dc |archivedate=August 17, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nLezak also earned his first individual Olympic medal, having tied for bronze with [[Brazil]]ian swimmer [[C\u00e9sar Cielo Filho]] in the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|100-meter freestyle]] with a time of 47.67.\n\nIn the final race of these games Lezak anchored the U.S. [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metre medley relay|4\u00d7100 m medley relay]] to a gold medal securing [[Michael Phelps]] final gold medal to break [[Mark Spitz]] record.\n\n====2012 Olympics====\nLezak qualified for his fourth Olympics at the [[2012 United States Olympic Trials (swimming)|2012 United States Olympic Trials]] in Omaha, Nebraska.

Olympic gold medalist. He swam for Rose Bowl Aquatics. He graduated from [[Irvine High School (Irvine, California)|Irvine High School]] in 1994, and then from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1999.\n\nLezak was a specialist in the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle races. He also owns long-course world records in the 400 m freestyle and medley relays, and is a former American record holder in the 100-meter freestyle. Lezak was one of the few elite swimmers not to have a personal coach. Despite this, Lezak enjoys team sports and fellow American [[Gary Hall Jr.]] dubbed Lezak as a \"professional relay swimmer\" at the 2004 U.S. Olympic Trials before their match-up in the 100-meter freestyle.<ref>[http://www.nbcolympics.com/search/index.htmx?q=lezak]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-olylezak12-2008aug12,0,6313222.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=A team player who rises to the challenge | first=Lisa | last=Dillman | date=August 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nLezak was born in [[Irvine, California]], the son of Linda (n\u00e9e Mann), an elementary school science teacher, and David Lezak, a former leather goods salesman.<ref name=\"usaswimming.org\">http://usaswimming.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabId=1453&Alias=Rainbow&Lang=en&biosid=614353d8-9dbd-4f8f-9766-0b90730d9ce7</ref> He is [[Jewish]].<ref name=JSR911>{{cite journal|title=Sports Shorts|journal=Jewish Sports Review|date=September\u2013October 2011|volume=8|issue=87|pages=18}}</ref> The name Lezak is pronounced Leh-Zhack and is Polish (short e).

In the final 25 meters, Lezak overtook French team anchor [[Alain Bernard]] (the world record holder in the 100-meter freestyle going into the relay) to win gold despite Bernard having nearly a full body length's advantage when Lezak started his leg and half a body length 25 meters from the end. Lezak split a 46.06, the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in history by nearly six-tenths of a second (It is the fastest by 0.08 seconds now, Duncan Scott swam a 46.14s split in the 2019 World Championships 4x100 medley relay). The final time of the American team was 3:08:24, which was 3.99 seconds faster than the previous world record; the French team finished second at 3:08.32, eight one-hundredths (0.08) of a second behind\u2014the closest finish in the event's history. This was a crucial race for [[Michael Phelps]], because he needed it to complete the goal of winning eight gold medals in a single Olympic Games, breaking [[Mark Spitz]]'s record of seven gold medals at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=\"yahoo_reuters\">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080807/sp_nm/olympics_swimming_bernard_dc |title=I'm favorite and we'll smash U.S.: Bernard |accessdate=August 11, 2008 |publisher=Reuters |date=August 7, 2008 |author=Francois Thomazeau |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817202914/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080807/sp_nm/olympics_swimming_bernard_dc |archivedate=August 17, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nLezak also earned his first individual Olympic medal, having tied for bronze with [[Brazil]]ian swimmer [[C\u00e9sar Cielo Filho]] in the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|100-meter freestyle]] with a time of 47.67.\n\n====2012 Olympics====\nLezak qualified for his fourth Olympics at the [[2012 United States Olympic Trials (swimming)|2012 United States Olympic Trials]] in Omaha, Nebraska.

Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1971, p. 95.</ref> Despite its name, the figures in the style are very often highly idealized, especially in sculpture, where it often leans heavily on the conventions of [[classical sculpture]]. Although related, it should not be confused with [[social realism]], a type of art that realistically depicts subjects of social concern,<ref>Todd, James G. \"Social Realism\". Art Terms. Museum of Modern Art, 2009.</ref> or other forms of [[Realism (art movement)|\"realism\" in the visual arts]].\n\nSocialist realism was the predominant form of [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|approved art in the Soviet Union]] from its development in the early 1920s to its eventual fall from official status beginning in the late 1960s until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica on-line definition of Socialist Realism</ref><ref>Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 20</ref> While other countries have employed a prescribed canon of art, socialist realism in the Soviet Union persisted longer and was more restrictive than elsewhere in Europe.<ref>Valkenier, Elizabeth. ''Russian Realist Art''. Ardis, 1977, p. 3.</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Kulturpalast Dresden Wandbild, Ausschnitt.jpg|thumb|Detail, ''Der Weg der Roten Fahne'', [[Kulturpalast (Dresden)|Kulturpalast]] [[Dresden]], Germany]]\nSocialist realism was developed by many thousands of artists, across a diverse society, over several decades.<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 17\">Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 17</ref> Early examples of realism in Russian art include the work of the [[Peredvizhniki]]s and [[Ilya Yefimovich Repin]]. While these works do not have the same political connotation, they exhibit the techniques exercised by their successors. After the [[Bolsheviks]] took control of Russia on October 25, 1917, there was a marked shift in artistic styles. There had been a short period of artistic exploration in the time between the fall of the [[Tsar]] and the rise of the Bolsheviks.\n\nShortly after the Bolsheviks took control, [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] was appointed as head of [[Narkompros]], the People's Commissariat for Enlightenment.<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 17\" />  This put Lunacharsky in the position of deciding the direction of art in the newly created Soviet state. Although Lunacharsky did not dictate a single aesthetic model for Soviet artists to follow, he developed a system of aesthetics based on the human body that would later help to influence socialist realism. He believed that \"the sight of a healthy body, intelligent face or friendly smile was essentially life-enhancing.\"<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 21\">Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 21</ref> He concluded that art had a direct effect on the human organism and under the right circumstances that effect could be positive. By depicting \"the perfect person\" ([[New Soviet man]]), Lunacharsky believed art could educate citizens on how to be the perfect Soviets.<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 21\" />\n\n=== Debate within Soviet art ===\n[[File:First Lenin statue in USSR 1924.jpg|thumb|First Lenin statue built by the workers in [[Noginsk]]]]\nThere were two main groups debating the fate of Soviet art: futurists and traditionalists. [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futurists]], many of whom had been creating abstract or leftist art before the Bolsheviks, believed communism required a complete rupture from the past and, therefore, so did Soviet art.<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 21\" /> Traditionalists believed in the importance of realistic representations of everyday life.  Under [[Lenin]]'s rule and the [[New Economic Policy]], there was a certain amount of private commercial enterprise, allowing both the futurists and the traditionalists to produce their art for individuals with capital.<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 22\">Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 22</ref> By 1928, the Soviet government had enough strength and authority to end private enterprises, thus ending support for fringe groups such as the futurists. At this point, although the term \"socialist realism\" was not being used, its defining characteristics became the norm.<ref>Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 23</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Great Russian Encyclopedia]], the term was first used in press by a high functionary of the  [[Union of Soviet Writers]] {{ill|Ivan Gronsky|ru|\u0413\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in [[Literaturnaya Gazeta]] on May 23, 1932.<ref>\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c.

''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 37</ref> [[Maxim Gorky]], a proponent of literary socialist realism, published a famous article titled \"Socialist Realism\" in 1933.<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 37\" /> During the Congress of 1934, four guidelines were laid out for socialist realism.<ref>Juraga, Dubravka and Booker, Keith M. ''Socialist Cultures East and West''. Praeger, 2002, p.68</ref>\nThe work must be:\n# Proletarian: art relevant to the workers and understandable to them.\n# Typical: scenes of everyday life of the people.\n# Realistic: in the representational sense.\n# Partisan: supportive of the aims of the State and the Party.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n[[File:The Worker and Kolkhoz Woman.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'' by [[Vera Mukhina]] (1937)]]\n[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006428 004 Blick in die Halle mit einer Statue von Stalin u.jpg|thumb|Workers inspect architectural model under a statue of Stalin, [[Leipzig]], [[East Germany]], 1953.]]\nThe purpose of socialist realism was to limit popular culture to a specific, highly regulated faction of emotional expression that promoted Soviet ideals.<ref name=\"Nelson 1988, p. 5\">Nelson, Cary and Lawrence, Grossberg. ''Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture''.  University of Illinois Press, 1988, p. 5</ref> The party was of the utmost importance and was always to be favorably featured. The key concepts that developed assured loyalty to the party, \"[[partiinost']]\" (party-mindedness), \"ideinost\" (idea- or ideological-content), \"klassovost\" (class content), \"pravdivost\" (truthfulness).<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 38\">Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 38</ref>\n\nThere was a prevailing sense of optimism, as socialist realism's function was to show the ideal Soviet society. Not only was the present gloried, but the future was also supposed to be depicted in an agreeable fashion. Because the present and the future were constantly idealized, socialist realism had a sense of forced optimism. Tragedy and negativity were not permitted, unless they were shown in a different time or place. This sentiment created what would later be dubbed \"revolutionary romanticism.\"<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 38\" />\n\nRevolutionary romanticism elevated the common worker, whether factory or agricultural, by presenting his life, work, and recreation as admirable. Its purpose was to show how much the standard of living had improved thanks to the revolution. Art was used as educational information. By illustrating the party's success, artists were showing their viewers that sovietism was the best political system. Art was also used to show how Soviet citizens should be acting. The ultimate aim was to create what Lenin called \"an entirely new type of human being\": The ''[[New Soviet Man]]''. Art (especially posters and murals) was a way to instill party values on a massive scale.  Stalin described the socialist realist artists as \"engineers of souls.\"<ref name=\"Overy, Richard 2004, p. 354\">Overy, Richard. ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''. W. W. Norton & Company, 2004, p. 354</ref>\n\nCommon images used in socialist realism were flowers, sunlight, the body, youth, flight, industry, and new technology.<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 38\" /> These poetic images were used to show the utopianism of communism and the Soviet state. Art became more than an aesthetic pleasure; instead it served a very specific function. Soviet ideals placed functionality and work above all else; therefore, for art to be admired, it must serve a purpose. [[Georgi Plekhanov]], a Marxist theoretician, states that art is useful if it serves society: \"There can be no doubt that art acquired a social significance only in so far as it depicts, evokes, or conveys ''actions, emotions and events that are of significance to society''.\"<ref>Schwartz, Lawrence H. ''Marxism and Culture''. Kennikat Press, 1980, p. 110</ref>\n\nThe artist could not, however, portray life just as they saw it because anything that reflected poorly on Communism had to be omitted. People who could not be shown as either wholly good or wholly evil could not be used as characters.<ref>Frankel, Tobia. ''The Russian Artist''. Macmillan Company, 1972, p. 125</ref> This was reflective of the Soviet idea that morality is simple: things are either right or wrong. This view on morality called for idealism over realism.<ref name=\"Overy, Richard 2004, p. 354\" /> Art was filled with health and happiness: paintings showed busy industrial and agricultural scenes; sculptures depicted workers, sentries, and schoolchildren.<ref>Stegelbaum, Lewis and Sokolov, Andrei. ''Stalinism As A Way Of Life''. Yale University Press, 2004, p. 220</ref>\n\nCreativity was not an important part of socialist realism. The styles used in creating art during this period were those that would produce the most realistic results. Painters would depict happy, muscular peasants and workers in factories and collective farms. During the Stalin period, they produced numerous heroic portraits of Stalin to serve [[Stalin's cult of personality|his cult of personality]]\u2014all in the most realistic fashion possible.<ref>Juraga, Dubravka and Booker, Keith M. ''Socialist Cultures East and West''. Praeger, 2002, p.45</ref> The most important thing for a socialist realist artist was not artistic integrity but adherence to party doctrine.<ref name=\"Nelson 1988, p. 5\" />\n\n== Important groups ==\n[[File:Mitrophan Grekov 02.jpg|thumb|Mitrofan Grekov. Tachanka. 1924]]\nThe Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines Socialist Realism as: a Marxist aesthetic theory calling for the didactic use of literature, art, and music to develop social consciousness in an evolving socialist state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socialist+realism|title=Definition of SOCIALIST REALISM|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> Socialist Realism compelled artists of all forms to create positive or uplifting reflections of socialist utopian life by utilizing any visual media such as: posters, movies, newspapers, theater and radio beginning during the Communist Revolution of 1917, escalating during the reign of [[Joseph Stalin|Josef Stalin]] (1924\u20131953) until the early 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartstory.org/movement-socialist-realism.htm|title=Socialist Realism Movement Overview|website=The Art Story|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\n[[Vladimir Lenin]], head of the Russian government 1917\u20131924, laid the foundation for this new wave of art, suggesting that art is for the people and the people should love and understand it, while uniting the masses. Artists [[Naum Gabo]] and [[Antoine Pevsner]] attempted to define the lines of art under Lenin by writing \"The Realist Manifesto\" in 1920 suggesting that artists should be given free rein to create as their muse desired. Lenin, however, had a different purpose for art; wanting it functional, and Stalin built on that belief that art should be propaganda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartstory.org/movement-socialist-realism.htm|title=Socialist Realism \u2013 Concepts & Styles|website=The Art Story|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\n[[Maxim Gorky]], founder of the Socialist Realist movement, proclaimed in 1934 at the Soviet Writer's congress that any works of art that portrayed a negative or anti-governmental view of Russia were illegal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/socialist-realism|title=Socialist realism \u2013 Art Term|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> This turned individual artists and their masterpieces into state controlled propaganda.\n\nAfter the death of Stalin in 1953, he was succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] who harbored less draconian state controls and openly condemned Stalin's artistic demands in 1957 with his \"[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]\", and thus began a reversal in policy known as \"[[Khrushchev Thaw|Khrushchev's Thaw]].\" He believed that artists should not be constrained and should be allowed to live by their creative talents. In 1964, Khrushchev was removed and replaced by [[Leonid Brezhnev]] who reintroduced Stalin's ideas and reversed the artistic decisions made by Khrushchev.\n\nHowever, by the early 1980s, the Socialist Realist movement had begun to fade. Artist to date remark that the Russian Social Realist movement as the most oppressive and shunned period of Soviet Art.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartstory.org/movement-socialist-realism.htm|title=Socialist Realism \u2013 Concepts & Styles|website=The Art Story|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia (AKhRR) ===\nThe Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia ([[AKhRR]]) was established in 1922 and was one of the most influential artist groups in the USSR.

Its duties comprising from awards to punishment was the ultimate silencing of the most gifted writers. In August 1934, the union held its first congress where t''he &nbsp;revolutionary writer Maxim Gorky said, \u201c''The Writers\u2019 Union is not being created merely for the purpose of bodily uniting all artists of the pen, but so that professional unification may enable them to comprehend their corporate strength, to define with all possible clarity their varied tendencies, creative activity, guiding principles, and harmoniously to merge all aims in that unity which is guiding all the creative working energies of the country.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1934-2/writers-congress/writers-congress-texts/gorky-on-soviet-literature/|title=Gorky on Soviet Literature|date=August 15, 2015|website=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most famous authors during this time was Alexander Fadeyev(24, December 1901\u201313, May 1956). Fadeyev was a close personal friend of Stalin and called Stalin \"one of the greatest humanists the world has ever seen.\"His most famous works include \"The Rout\" and \"The Young Guard\".\"The Young Guard\" is a book written by Fadeyev, it was written about an anti-German group called the Young Guards, a group of young men that opposed the Germans. The book details the story of a few different members of the group. It was praised by the Soviet Union and the patriotism show by the group of men.\n\n== Impact ==\n[[File:Warszawa-mauzoleum monument.jpg|thumb|250px|A monumental [[obelisk]] surrounded by sculptures of soldiers at the [[Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw]]]]\n\nThe impact of socialist realism art can still be seen and felt decades after it was no longer the only state supported style. Even before the end of the [[USSR]] in 1991, the government had been loosening its hold on censorship. After [[Stalin]]'s death in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] began to condemn the previous regime's practice of excessive restrictions. This freedom allowed artists to begin experimenting with new techniques, but the shift was not immediate. It was not until the ultimate fall of Soviet rule that artists were no longer restricted by the communist party. Many socialist realism tendencies prevailed until the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s.<ref name=\"Evangeli, Aleksandr 2012, p. 218\">Evangeli, Aleksandr. \"Echoes of Socialist Realism in Post-Soviet Art\", ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 218</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, many Russian artists used socialist realism characteristics in an ironic fashion.<ref name=\"Evangeli, Aleksandr 2012, p. 218\" /> This was a complete rupture from what existed only a couple of decades before. Once artists broke from the socialist realism mold there was a significant power shift. Artists began including subjects that could not exist according to Soviet ideals. Now that the power over appearances was taken away from the government, artists achieved a level of authority that had not existed since the early 20th century.<ref>Evangeli, Aleksandr. \"Echoes of Socialist Realism in Post-Soviet Art\", ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 221</ref> In the decade immediately after the fall of the USSR, artists represented socialist realism and the Soviet legacy as a traumatic event. By the next decade, there was a unique sense of detachment.<ref>Evangeli, Aleksandr. \"Echoes of Socialist Realism in Post-Soviet Art\", ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 223</ref>\n\nWestern cultures often do not look at socialist realism positively.

Other important works of literature include [[Fyodor Gladkov]]'s ''[[Cement (novel)|Cement]]'' (1925), [[Nikolai Ostrovsky]]'s ''[[How the Steel Was Tempered]]'' and [[Mikhail Sholokhov]]'s two volume epic, ''[[Quiet Flows the Don]]'' (1934) and ''[[The Don Flows Home to the Sea]]'' (1940). [[Yury Krymov]]'s novel ''Tanker \"Derbent\"'' (1938) portrays Soviet merchant seafarers being transformed by the [[Stakhanovite movement]].\n\n[[Martin Andersen Nex\u00f8]] developed socialist realism in his own way. His creative method featured a combination of publicistic passion, a critical view of capitalist society, and a steadfast striving to bring reality into accord with socialist ideals. The novel ''Pelle, the Conqueror'' is considered to be a classic of socialist realism.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The novel ''Ditte, Daughter of Man'' had a working-class woman as its heroine. He battled against the enemies of socialism in the books ''Two Worlds'', and ''Hands Off!''.\n\nThe novels of [[Louis Aragon]], such as ''The Real World'', depict the working class as a rising force of the nation. He published two books of documentary prose, ''The Communist Man''. In the collection of poems ''A Knife in the Heart Again'', Aragon criticizes the penetration of [[American imperialism]] into Europe. The novel ''The Holy Week'' depicts the artist's path toward the people against a broad social and historical background.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n[[File:Brodski lenin.jpg|thumb|[[Isaak Brodsky]], ''Lenin in Smolny'' (1930), living up to the title of \"realism\" more than most works of the style.]]\n\n[[Hanns Eisler]] composed many workers' songs, marches, and ballads on current political topics such as ''Song of Solidarity'', ''Song of the United Front'', and ''Song of the Comintern''. He was a founder of a new style of revolutionary song for the masses. He also composed works in larger forms such as ''Requiem for Lenin''. Eisler's most important works include the cantatas ''German Symphony'', ''Serenade of the Age'' and ''Song of Peace''. Eisler combines features of revolutionary songs with varied expression. His symphonic music is known for its complex and subtle orchestration.\n\nClosely associated with the rise of the [[labor movement]] was the development of the [[revolutionary song]], which was performed at demonstrations and meetings. Among the most famous of the revolutionary songs are ''[[The Internationale]]'' and ''[[Whirlwinds of Danger]]''. Notable songs from Russia include ''Boldly, Comrades, in Step'', ''Workers' Marseillaise'', and ''Rage, Tyrants''. Folk and revolutionary songs influenced the Soviet [[mass song]]s. The mass song was a leading genre in Soviet music, especially during the 1930s and the war. The mass song influenced other genres, including the art song, opera, and film music. The most popular mass songs include [[Isaak Dunayevsky|Dunaevsky's]] ''Song of the Homeland'', [[Matvey Blanter|Blanter's]] ''[[Katyusha (song)|Katiusha]]'', Novikov's ''Hymn of Democratic Youth of the World'', and [[Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov|Aleksandrov's]] ''[[Svyaschennaya Voyna|Sacred War]]''.\n\nIn the early 1930s, [[Soviet cinema|Soviet filmmakers]] applied socialist realism in their work. Notable films include ''Chapaev'', which shows the role of the people in the history-making process. The theme of revolutionary history was developed in films such as ''[[The Youth of Maxim]]'', by [[Grigori Kozintsev]] and [[Leonid Trauberg]], ''[[Shchors (film)|Shchors]]'' by Dovzhenko, and ''We are from Kronstadt'' by E. Dzigan. The shaping of the new man under socialism was a theme of films such as ''A Start Life'' by N. Ekk, ''Ivan'' by Dovzhenko, ''Valerii Chkalov'' by M. Kalatozov and the film version of ''Tanker \"Derbent\"'' (1941). Some films depicted the part of peoples of the Soviet Union against foreign invaders: ''Alexander Nevsky'' by Eisenstein, ''Minin and Pozharsky'' by Pudvokin, and ''Bogdan Khmelnitsky'' by Savchenko. Soviet politicians were the subjects in films such as [[Sergei Yutkevich|Yutkevich]]'s trilogy of movies about Lenin.\n\nSocialist realism was also applied to [[Bollywood|Hindi films]] of the 1940s and 1950s.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} These include [[Chetan Anand (producer & director)|Chetan Anand]]'s ''[[Neecha Nagar]]'' (1946), which won the [[Palme d'Or|Grand Prize]] at the [[1946 Cannes Film Festival|1st Cannes Film Festival]], and [[Bimal Roy]]'s ''[[Two Acres of Land]]'' (1953), which won the International Prize at the [[1954 Cannes Film Festival|7th Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThe painter [[Aleksandr Deineka]] provides a notable example for his expressionist and patriotic scenes of the Second World War, collective farms, and sports.

Socialist trends in literature were established in the 1920s in Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Writers who helped develop socialist realism in the West included [[Louis Aragon]], [[Johannes Becher]], and [[Pablo Neruda]].<ref name=\"cultinfo.ru\">[https://archive.is/20050508193618/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/104/892.htm D.F.

It involved all domains of visual and literary arts, though its most spectacular achievements were made in the field of architecture, considered a key weapon in the creation of a new [[social order]], intended to help spread the communist doctrine by influencing citizens' consciousness as well as their outlook on life. During this massive undertaking, a crucial role fell to architects perceived not as merely engineers creating streets and edifices, but rather as \"[[engineers of the human soul]]\" who, in addition to extending simple aesthetics into urban design, were to express grandiose ideas and arouse feelings of stability, persistence and political power.\n\nIn art, from the mid-1960s more relaxed and decorative styles became acceptable even in large public works in the [[Warsaw Pact]] bloc, the style mostly deriving from popular posters, illustrations and other works on paper, with discreet influence from their Western equivalents.\n\nToday, arguably the only countries still focused on these aesthetic principles are [[North Korea]], [[Laos]], and to some extent [[Vietnam]]. The People's Republic of China occasionally reverts to socialist realism for specific purposes, such as idealised propaganda posters to promote the [[Chinese space program]]. Socialist realism had little mainstream impact in the non-Communist world, where it was widely seen as a totalitarian means of imposing state control on artists.<ref>[http://www.sinoss.net/qikan/uploadfile/2011/0708/20110708020439197.pdf Lin Jung-hua.

''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 17</ref> Early examples of realism in Russian art include the work of the [[Peredvizhniki]]s and [[Ilya Yefimovich Repin]]. While these works do not have the same political connotation, they exhibit the techniques exercised by their successors. After the [[Bolsheviks]] took control of Russia on October 25, 1917, there was a marked shift in artistic styles. There had been a short period of artistic exploration in the time between the fall of the [[Tsar]] and the rise of the Bolsheviks.\n\nShortly after the Bolsheviks took control, [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] was appointed as head of [[Narkompros]], the People's Commissariat for Enlightenment.<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 17\" />  This put Lunacharsky in the position of deciding the direction of art in the newly created Soviet state. Although Lunacharsky did not dictate a single aesthetic model for Soviet artists to follow, he developed a system of aesthetics based on the human body that would later help to influence socialist realism. He believed that \"the sight of a healthy body, intelligent face or friendly smile was essentially life-enhancing.\"<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 21\">Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 21</ref> He concluded that art had a direct effect on the human organism and under the right circumstances that effect could be positive. By depicting \"the perfect person\" ([[New Soviet man]]), Lunacharsky believed art could educate citizens on how to be the perfect Soviets.<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 21\" />\n\n=== Debate within Soviet art ===\n[[File:First Lenin statue in USSR 1924.jpg|thumb|First Lenin statue built by the workers in [[Noginsk]]]]\nThere were two main groups debating the fate of Soviet art: futurists and traditionalists. [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futurists]], many of whom had been creating abstract or leftist art before the Bolsheviks, believed communism required a complete rupture from the past and, therefore, so did Soviet art.<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 21\" /> Traditionalists believed in the importance of realistic representations of everyday life.  Under [[Lenin]]'s rule and the [[New Economic Policy]], there was a certain amount of private commercial enterprise, allowing both the futurists and the traditionalists to produce their art for individuals with capital.<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 22\">Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 22</ref> By 1928, the Soviet government had enough strength and authority to end private enterprises, thus ending support for fringe groups such as the futurists. At this point, although the term \"socialist realism\" was not being used, its defining characteristics became the norm.<ref>Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''.

''Socialist Cultures East and West''.

''Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture''.  University of Illinois Press, 1988, p. 5</ref> The party was of the utmost importance and was always to be favorably featured. The key concepts that developed assured loyalty to the party, \"[[partiinost']]\" (party-mindedness), \"ideinost\" (idea- or ideological-content), \"klassovost\" (class content), \"pravdivost\" (truthfulness).<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 38\">Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 38</ref>\n\nThere was a prevailing sense of optimism, as socialist realism's function was to show the ideal Soviet society. Not only was the present gloried, but the future was also supposed to be depicted in an agreeable fashion. Because the present and the future were constantly idealized, socialist realism had a sense of forced optimism. Tragedy and negativity were not permitted, unless they were shown in a different time or place. This sentiment created what would later be dubbed \"revolutionary romanticism.\"<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 38\" />\n\nRevolutionary romanticism elevated the common worker, whether factory or agricultural, by presenting his life, work, and recreation as admirable. Its purpose was to show how much the standard of living had improved thanks to the revolution. Art was used as educational information. By illustrating the party's success, artists were showing their viewers that sovietism was the best political system. Art was also used to show how Soviet citizens should be acting. The ultimate aim was to create what Lenin called \"an entirely new type of human being\": The ''[[New Soviet Man]]''. Art (especially posters and murals) was a way to instill party values on a massive scale.  Stalin described the socialist realist artists as \"engineers of souls.\"<ref name=\"Overy, Richard 2004, p. 354\">Overy, Richard. ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''. W. W. Norton & Company, 2004, p. 354</ref>\n\nCommon images used in socialist realism were flowers, sunlight, the body, youth, flight, industry, and new technology.<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 38\" /> These poetic images were used to show the utopianism of communism and the Soviet state. Art became more than an aesthetic pleasure; instead it served a very specific function. Soviet ideals placed functionality and work above all else; therefore, for art to be admired, it must serve a purpose. [[Georgi Plekhanov]], a Marxist theoretician, states that art is useful if it serves society: \"There can be no doubt that art acquired a social significance only in so far as it depicts, evokes, or conveys ''actions, emotions and events that are of significance to society''.\"<ref>Schwartz, Lawrence H. ''Marxism and Culture''. Kennikat Press, 1980, p. 110</ref>\n\nThe artist could not, however, portray life just as they saw it because anything that reflected poorly on Communism had to be omitted. People who could not be shown as either wholly good or wholly evil could not be used as characters.<ref>Frankel, Tobia. ''The Russian Artist''. Macmillan Company, 1972, p. 125</ref> This was reflective of the Soviet idea that morality is simple: things are either right or wrong. This view on morality called for idealism over realism.<ref name=\"Overy, Richard 2004, p. 354\" /> Art was filled with health and happiness: paintings showed busy industrial and agricultural scenes; sculptures depicted workers, sentries, and schoolchildren.<ref>Stegelbaum, Lewis and Sokolov, Andrei. ''Stalinism As A Way Of Life''. Yale University Press, 2004, p. 220</ref>\n\nCreativity was not an important part of socialist realism. The styles used in creating art during this period were those that would produce the most realistic results. Painters would depict happy, muscular peasants and workers in factories and collective farms. During the Stalin period, they produced numerous heroic portraits of Stalin to serve [[Stalin's cult of personality|his cult of personality]]\u2014all in the most realistic fashion possible.<ref>Juraga, Dubravka and Booker, Keith M. ''Socialist Cultures East and West''. Praeger, 2002, p.45</ref> The most important thing for a socialist realist artist was not artistic integrity but adherence to party doctrine.<ref name=\"Nelson 1988, p. 5\" />\n\n== Important groups ==\n[[File:Mitrophan Grekov 02.jpg|thumb|Mitrofan Grekov.

Artists [[Naum Gabo]] and [[Antoine Pevsner]] attempted to define the lines of art under Lenin by writing \"The Realist Manifesto\" in 1920 suggesting that artists should be given free rein to create as their muse desired. Lenin, however, had a different purpose for art; wanting it functional, and Stalin built on that belief that art should be propaganda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartstory.org/movement-socialist-realism.htm|title=Socialist Realism \u2013 Concepts & Styles|website=The Art Story|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\n[[Maxim Gorky]], founder of the Socialist Realist movement, proclaimed in 1934 at the Soviet Writer's congress that any works of art that portrayed a negative or anti-governmental view of Russia were illegal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/socialist-realism|title=Socialist realism \u2013 Art Term|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> This turned individual artists and their masterpieces into state controlled propaganda.\n\nAfter the death of Stalin in 1953, he was succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] who harbored less draconian state controls and openly condemned Stalin's artistic demands in 1957 with his \"[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]\", and thus began a reversal in policy known as \"[[Khrushchev Thaw|Khrushchev's Thaw]].\" He believed that artists should not be constrained and should be allowed to live by their creative talents. In 1964, Khrushchev was removed and replaced by [[Leonid Brezhnev]] who reintroduced Stalin's ideas and reversed the artistic decisions made by Khrushchev.\n\nHowever, by the early 1980s, the Socialist Realist movement had begun to fade.

The AKhRR worked to truthfully document contemporary life in Russia by utilizing \"heroic realism\".<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 22\" /> The term \"heroic realism\" was beginning of the socialist realism archetype. AKhRR was sponsored by influential government officials such as [[Leon Trotsky]] and carried favor with the [[Red Army]].<ref name=\"Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 22\" />\n\nIn 1928, the AKhRR was renamed to Association of Artists of the Revolution (AKhR) in order to include the rest of the Soviet states.

Its duties comprising from awards to punishment was the ultimate silencing of the most gifted writers. In August 1934, the union held its first congress where t''he &nbsp;revolutionary writer Maxim Gorky said, \u201c''The Writers\u2019 Union is not being created merely for the purpose of bodily uniting all artists of the pen, but so that professional unification may enable them to comprehend their corporate strength, to define with all possible clarity their varied tendencies, creative activity, guiding principles, and harmoniously to merge all aims in that unity which is guiding all the creative working energies of the country.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1934-2/writers-congress/writers-congress-texts/gorky-on-soviet-literature/|title=Gorky on Soviet Literature|date=August 15, 2015|website=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most famous authors during this time was Alexander Fadeyev(24, December 1901\u201313, May 1956). Fadeyev was a close personal friend of Stalin and called Stalin \"one of the greatest humanists the world has ever seen.\"His most famous works include \"The Rout\" and \"The Young Guard\".\"The Young Guard\" is a book written by Fadeyev, it was written about an anti-German group called the Young Guards, a group of young men that opposed the Germans. The book details the story of a few different members of the group. It was praised by the Soviet Union and the patriotism show by the group of men.\n\n== Impact ==\n[[File:Warszawa-mauzoleum monument.jpg|thumb|250px|A monumental [[obelisk]] surrounded by sculptures of soldiers at the [[Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw]]]]\n\nThe impact of socialist realism art can still be seen and felt decades after it was no longer the only state supported style. Even before the end of the [[USSR]] in 1991, the government had been loosening its hold on censorship. After [[Stalin]]'s death in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] began to condemn the previous regime's practice of excessive restrictions. This freedom allowed artists to begin experimenting with new techniques, but the shift was not immediate. It was not until the ultimate fall of Soviet rule that artists were no longer restricted by the communist party. Many socialist realism tendencies prevailed until the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s.<ref name=\"Evangeli, Aleksandr 2012, p. 218\">Evangeli, Aleksandr. \"Echoes of Socialist Realism in Post-Soviet Art\", ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 218</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, many Russian artists used socialist realism characteristics in an ironic fashion.<ref name=\"Evangeli, Aleksandr 2012, p. 218\" /> This was a complete rupture from what existed only a couple of decades before. Once artists broke from the socialist realism mold there was a significant power shift. Artists began including subjects that could not exist according to Soviet ideals. Now that the power over appearances was taken away from the government, artists achieved a level of authority that had not existed since the early 20th century.<ref>Evangeli, Aleksandr. \"Echoes of Socialist Realism in Post-Soviet Art\", ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920\u20131970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 221</ref> In the decade immediately after the fall of the USSR, artists represented socialist realism and the Soviet legacy as a traumatic event.

Other important works of literature include [[Fyodor Gladkov]]'s ''[[Cement (novel)|Cement]]'' (1925), [[Nikolai Ostrovsky]]'s ''[[How the Steel Was Tempered]]'' and [[Mikhail Sholokhov]]'s two volume epic, ''[[Quiet Flows the Don]]'' (1934) and ''[[The Don Flows Home to the Sea]]'' (1940). [[Yury Krymov]]'s novel ''Tanker \"Derbent\"'' (1938) portrays Soviet merchant seafarers being transformed by the [[Stakhanovite movement]].\n\n[[Martin Andersen Nex\u00f8]] developed socialist realism in his own way. His creative method featured a combination of publicistic passion, a critical view of capitalist society, and a steadfast striving to bring reality into accord with socialist ideals. The novel ''Pelle, the Conqueror'' is considered to be a classic of socialist realism.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The novel ''Ditte, Daughter of Man'' had a working-class woman as its heroine. He battled against the enemies of socialism in the books ''Two Worlds'', and ''Hands Off!''.\n\nThe novels of [[Louis Aragon]], such as ''The Real World'', depict the working class as a rising force of the nation. He published two books of documentary prose, ''The Communist Man''. In the collection of poems ''A Knife in the Heart Again'', Aragon criticizes the penetration of [[American imperialism]] into Europe. The novel ''The Holy Week'' depicts the artist's path toward the people against a broad social and historical background.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n[[File:Brodski lenin.jpg|thumb|[[Isaak Brodsky]], ''Lenin in Smolny'' (1930), living up to the title of \"realism\" more than most works of the style.]]\n\n[[Hanns Eisler]] composed many workers' songs, marches, and ballads on current political topics such as ''Song of Solidarity'', ''Song of the United Front'', and ''Song of the Comintern''. He was a founder of a new style of revolutionary song for the masses. He also composed works in larger forms such as ''Requiem for Lenin''. Eisler's most important works include the cantatas ''German Symphony'', ''Serenade of the Age'' and ''Song of Peace''. Eisler combines features of revolutionary songs with varied expression. His symphonic music is known for its complex and subtle orchestration.\n\nClosely associated with the rise of the [[labor movement]] was the development of the [[revolutionary song]], which was performed at demonstrations and meetings. Among the most famous of the revolutionary songs are ''[[The Internationale]]'' and ''[[Whirlwinds of Danger]]''. Notable songs from Russia include ''Boldly, Comrades, in Step'', ''Workers' Marseillaise'', and ''Rage, Tyrants''. Folk and revolutionary songs influenced the Soviet [[mass song]]s. The mass song was a leading genre in Soviet music, especially during the 1930s and the war. The mass song influenced other genres, including the art song, opera, and film music. The most popular mass songs include [[Isaak Dunayevsky|Dunaevsky's]] ''Song of the Homeland'', [[Matvey Blanter|Blanter's]] ''[[Katyusha (song)|Katiusha]]'', Novikov's ''Hymn of Democratic Youth of the World'', and [[Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov|Aleksandrov's]] ''[[Svyaschennaya Voyna|Sacred War]]''.\n\nIn the early 1930s, [[Soviet cinema|Soviet filmmakers]] applied socialist realism in their work. Notable films include ''Chapaev'', which shows the role of the people in the history-making process. The theme of revolutionary history was developed in films such as ''[[The Youth of Maxim]]'', by [[Grigori Kozintsev]] and [[Leonid Trauberg]], ''[[Shchors (film)|Shchors]]'' by Dovzhenko, and ''We are from Kronstadt'' by E. Dzigan. The shaping of the new man under socialism was a theme of films such as ''A Start Life'' by N. Ekk, ''Ivan'' by Dovzhenko, ''Valerii Chkalov'' by M. Kalatozov and the film version of ''Tanker \"Derbent\"'' (1941). Some films depicted the part of peoples of the Soviet Union against foreign invaders: ''Alexander Nevsky'' by Eisenstein, ''Minin and Pozharsky'' by Pudvokin, and ''Bogdan Khmelnitsky'' by Savchenko. Soviet politicians were the subjects in films such as [[Sergei Yutkevich|Yutkevich]]'s trilogy of movies about Lenin.\n\nSocialist realism was also applied to [[Bollywood|Hindi films]] of the 1940s and 1950s.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} These include [[Chetan Anand (producer & director)|Chetan Anand]]'s ''[[Neecha Nagar]]'' (1946), which won the [[Palme d'Or|Grand Prize]] at the [[1946 Cannes Film Festival|1st Cannes Film Festival]], and [[Bimal Roy]]'s ''[[Two Acres of Land]]'' (1953), which won the International Prize at the [[1954 Cannes Film Festival|7th Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThe painter [[Aleksandr Deineka]] provides a notable example for his expressionist and patriotic scenes of the Second World War, collective farms, and sports.

It involved all domains of visual and literary arts, though its most spectacular achievements were made in the field of architecture, considered a key weapon in the creation of a new [[social order]], intended to help spread the communist doctrine by influencing citizens' consciousness as well as their outlook on life. During this massive undertaking, a crucial role fell to architects perceived not as merely engineers creating streets and edifices, but rather as \"[[engineers of the human soul]]\" who, in addition to extending simple aesthetics into urban design, were to express grandiose ideas and arouse feelings of stability, persistence and political power.\n\nIn art, from the mid-1960s more relaxed and decorative styles became acceptable even in large public works in the [[Warsaw Pact]] bloc, the style mostly deriving from popular posters, illustrations and other works on paper, with discreet influence from their Western equivalents.\n\nToday, arguably the only countries still focused on these aesthetic principles are [[North Korea]], [[Laos]], and to some extent [[Vietnam]]. The People's Republic of China occasionally reverts to socialist realism for specific purposes, such as idealised propaganda posters to promote the [[Chinese space program]]. Socialist realism had little mainstream impact in the non-Communist world, where it was widely seen as a totalitarian means of imposing state control on artists.<ref>[http://www.sinoss.net/qikan/uploadfile/2011/0708/20110708020439197.pdf Lin Jung-hua.

Witkovsky, \"Surrealism in the Plural: Guillaume Apollinaire, Ivan Goll and Dev\u011btsil in the 1920s\" ''Papers of Surrealism'', 2, Summer 2004, 1-14.</ref> The most important center of the movement was [[Paris]], France. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, impacting the visual arts, literature, film, and [[Surrealist music|music]] of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory.\n\n==Founding of the movement==\nThe word 'surrealism' was first coined in March 1917 by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].<ref>Hargrove, Nancy (1998). \"The Great Parade: Cocteau, Picasso, Satie, Massine, Diaghilev\u2014and T.S.

''Parade'' had a one-act scenario by [[Jean Cocteau]] and was performed with music by [[Erik Satie]]. Cocteau described the ballet as \"realistic\". Apollinaire went further, describing ''Parade'' as \"surrealistic\":<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150922015316/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-07112005-201540/unrestricted/Doyle_dis.pdf Tracy A.

We may expect it to bring about profound changes in our arts and manners through universal joyfulness, for it is only natural, after all, that they keep pace with scientific and industrial progress. (Apollinaire, 1917)<ref>Vassiliki Kolocotroni, Jane Goldman, and Olga Taxidou, ''Modernism: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'', University of Chicago Press, 1998, 211.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe term was taken up again by Apollinaire, both as subtitle and in the preface to his play ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias|Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias: Drame surr\u00e9aliste]]'',<ref>Gascoyne, p. 39</ref> which was written in 1903 and first performed in 1917.<ref>Sams, p. 282</ref>\n\n[[World War I]] scattered the writers and artists who had been based in Paris, and in the interim many became involved with Dada, believing that excessive rational thought and [[bourgeois]] values had brought the conflict of the war upon the world. The Dadaists protested with [[anti-art]] gatherings, performances, writings and art works. After the war, when they returned to Paris, the Dada activities continued.\n\nDuring the war, [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], who had trained in medicine and psychiatry, served in a [[Neurology|neurological]] hospital where he used [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic methods with soldiers suffering from [[shell-shock]]. Meeting the young writer [[Jacques Vach\u00e9]], Breton felt that Vach\u00e9 was the spiritual son of writer and [[pataphysics]] founder [[Alfred Jarry]].  He admired the young writer's anti-social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition. Later Breton wrote, \"In literature, I was successively taken with [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], with Jarry, with Apollinaire, with [[Germain Nouveau|Nouveau]], with [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont|Lautr\u00e9amont]], but it is Jacques Vach\u00e9 to whom I owe the most.\"<ref>Breton, \"Vach\u00e9 is surrealist in me\", in ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''.</ref>\n\nBack in Paris, Breton joined in Dada activities and started the literary journal ''[[Litt\u00e9rature (magazine)|Litt\u00e9rature]]'' along with [[Louis Aragon]] and [[Philippe Soupault]]. They began experimenting with [[Surrealist automatism|automatic writing]]\u2014spontaneously writing without censoring their thoughts\u2014and published the writings, as well as accounts of dreams, in the magazine. Breton and Soupault continued writing evolving their techniques of automatism and published ''[[Les Champs Magn\u00e9tiques|The Magnetic Fields]]'' (1920).\n\nBy October 1924 two rival Surrealist groups had formed to publish a [[Surrealist Manifesto]]. Each claimed to be successors of a revolution launched by Appolinaire. One group, led by [[Yvan Goll]] consisted of [[Pierre Albert-Birot]], [[Paul Derm\u00e9e]], [[C\u00e9line Arnauld]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], [[Marcel Arland]], [[Joseph Delteil]], [[Jean Painlev\u00e9]] and [[Robert Delaunay]], among others<ref>G\u00e9rard Durozoi, An excerpt from History of the Surrealist Movement, Chapter Two, 1924-1929, Salvation for Us Is Nowhere, translation by Alison Anderson, U of Chicago Press, pp. 63-74, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-226-17411-2}}.</ref> The group led by Andr\u00e9 Breton claimed that [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] was a better tactic for societal change than those of Dada, as led by Tzara, who was now among their rivals.

They embraced [[idiosyncrasy]], while rejecting the idea of an underlying madness. As Dal\u00ed later proclaimed, \"There is only one difference between a madman and me. I am not mad.\"<ref name=\"Diary of a Genius\"/>\n\nBeside the use of dream analysis, they emphasized that \"one could combine inside the same frame, elements not normally found together to produce illogical and startling effects.\"<ref name=\"PynchonSurralism\"/> Breton included the idea of the startling juxtapositions in his 1924 manifesto, taking it in turn from a 1918 essay by poet [[Pierre Reverdy]], which said: \"a juxtaposition of two more or less distant realities.

They wanted to free people from false rationality, and restrictive customs and structures. Breton proclaimed that the true aim of Surrealism was \"long live the social revolution, and it alone!\" To this goal, at various times Surrealists aligned with [[communism]] and [[anarchism]].\n\nIn 1924 two Surrealist factions declared their philosophy in two separate Surrealist Manifestos.

He included citations of the influences on Surrealism, examples of Surrealist works, and discussion of Surrealist automatism. He provided the following definitions:\n\n{{quotation|'''Dictionary:''' Surrealism, n.

Breton initially doubted that visual arts could even be useful in the Surrealist movement since they appeared to be less malleable and open to chance and [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]]. This caution was overcome by the discovery of such techniques as [[frottage (art)|frottage]] and [[decalcomania]].\n\nSoon more visual artists became involved, including [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Valentine Hugo]], [[M\u00e9ret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Kansuke Yamamoto (artist)|Kansuke Yamamoto]] and later after the second war: [[Enrico Donati]]. Though Breton admired [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] and courted them to join the movement, they remained peripheral.<ref name=\"tomkins\">[[Calvin Tomkins|Tomkins, Calvin]], ''Duchamp: A Biography''. Henry Holt and Company, Inc, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8050-5789-7}}</ref> More writers also joined, including former Dadaist [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Ren\u00e9 Char]], and [[Georges Sadoul]].\n\n[[File:Masson automatic drawing.jpg|thumb|[[Andr\u00e9 Masson]]. Automatic Drawing. 1924. Ink on paper, 23.5 x 20.6 cm. [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.]]\nIn 1925 an autonomous Surrealist group formed in Brussels. The group included the musician, poet, and artist [[E. L. T. Mesens]], painter and writer [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]], [[Paul Noug\u00e9]], [[Marcel Lecomte]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Souris]]. In 1927 they were joined by the writer [[Louis Scutenaire]]. They corresponded regularly with the Paris group, and in 1927 both Goemans and Magritte moved to Paris and frequented Breton's circle.<ref name=\"grove\"/> The artists, with their roots in [[Dada]] and [[Cubism]], the abstraction of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Expressionism]], and [[Post-Impressionism]], also reached to older \"bloodlines\" or [[Proto-Surrealism|proto-surrealists]] such as [[Hieronymus Bosch]], and the so-called primitive and naive arts.\n\n[[Andr\u00e9 Masson]]'s [[automatic drawing]]s of 1923 are often used as the point of the acceptance of visual arts and the break from Dada, since they reflect the influence of the idea of the [[unconscious mind]]. Another example is Giacometti's 1925 ''Torso'', which marked his movement to simplified forms and inspiration from preclassical sculpture.\n\nHowever, a striking example of the line used to divide Dada and Surrealism among art experts is the pairing of 1925's [[Little Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person|''Little Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person (Von minimax dadamax selbst konstruiertes maschinchen)'']]<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1129 Link to Guggenheim collection] with reproduction of the painting and further information.</ref> with ''The Kiss (Le Baiser)''<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1132 Link to Guggenheim collection] with reproduction of the painting and further information.</ref> from 1927 by Max Ernst. The first is generally held to have a distance, and erotic subtext, whereas the second presents an erotic act openly and directly. In the second the influence of [[Joan Mir\u00f3|Mir\u00f3]] and the drawing style of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] is visible with the use of fluid curving and intersecting lines and colour, whereas the first takes a directness that would later be influential in movements such as [[Pop art]].\n[[File:The Red Tower.jpg|left|thumb|[[Giorgio de Chirico]], ''The Red Tower (La Tour Rouge)'', 1913, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]]]\nGiorgio de Chirico, and his previous development of [[metaphysical art]], was one of the important joining figures between the philosophical and visual aspects of Surrealism. Between 1911 and 1917, he adopted an unornamented depictional style whose surface would be adopted by others later. ''The Red Tower (La tour rouge)'' from 1913 shows the stark colour contrasts and illustrative style later adopted by Surrealist painters. His 1914 ''The Nostalgia of the Poet (La Nostalgie du po\u00e8te)''<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/854 Link to Guggenheim collection] with reproduction of the painting and further information.</ref> has the figure turned away from the viewer, and the juxtaposition of a bust with glasses and a fish as a relief defies conventional explanation. He was also a writer whose novel ''[[Hebdomeros]]'' presents a series of dreamscapes with an unusual use of punctuation, syntax, and grammar designed to create an atmosphere and frame its images. His images, including set designs for the [[Ballets Russes]], would create a decorative form of Surrealism, and he would be an influence on the two artists who would be even more closely associated with Surrealism in the public mind: Dal\u00ed and Magritte. He would, however, leave the Surrealist group in 1928.\n\nIn 1924, Mir\u00f3 and Masson applied Surrealism to painting. The first Surrealist exhibition, ''La Peinture Surrealiste'', was held at Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. It displayed works by Masson, [[Man Ray]], [[Paul Klee]], Mir\u00f3, and others. The show confirmed that Surrealism had a component in the visual arts (though it had been initially debated whether this was possible), and techniques from Dada, such as [[photomontage]], were used. The following year, on March 26, 1926 Galerie Surr\u00e9aliste opened  with an exhibition by Man Ray. Breton published ''Surrealism and Painting'' in 1928 which summarized the movement to that point, though he continued to update the work until the 1960s.\n\n===Surrealist literature===\n{{See also|List of Surrealist poets}}\n[[File:MagrittePipe.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Treachery of Images]]'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]] (1929), featuring the famous declaration, \"This is not a pipe.\" [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]]]\n\nThe first Surrealist work, according to leader Br\u00eaton, was [[Les Chants de Maldoror]];<ref>Br\u00eaton, Andr\u00e9. ''Communicating Vessels''. Trans. Mary Ann Caws & Geoffrey T. Harris. London & Lincoln: U of Nebraska Press/Bison Books, 1990.</ref> and the first work written and published by his group of ''Surr\u00e9alistes'' was ''[[Les Champs Magn\u00e9tiques]]'' (May\u2013June 1919).<ref>Br\u00eaton, Andr\u00e9. Les Vases communicants. Paris: Gallimard, 1955.</ref> ''Litt\u00e9rature'' contained automatist works and accounts of dreams. The magazine and the portfolio both showed their disdain for literal meanings given to objects and focused rather on the undertones, the poetic undercurrents present. Not only did they give emphasis to the poetic undercurrents, but also to the connotations and the overtones which \"exist in ambiguous relationships to the visual images\"<ref>Vaneigem, Raoul. A Cavalier History of Surrealism. Trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith. Oakland: AK Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nBecause Surrealist writers seldom, if ever, appear to organize their thoughts and the images they present, some people find much of their work difficult to parse. This notion however is a superficial comprehension, prompted no doubt by Breton's initial emphasis on automatic writing as the main route toward a higher reality. But\u2014as in Breton's case\u2014much of what is presented as purely automatic is actually edited and very \"thought out\". Breton himself later admitted that automatic writing's centrality had been overstated, and other elements were introduced, especially as the growing involvement of visual artists in the movement forced the issue, since automatic painting required a rather more strenuous set of approaches. Thus such elements as collage were introduced, arising partly from an ideal of startling juxtapositions as revealed in [[Pierre Reverdy]]'s poetry. And\u2014as in Magritte's case (where there is no obvious recourse to either automatic techniques or collage)\u2014the very notion of convulsive joining became a tool for revelation in and of itself. Surrealism was meant to be always in flux\u2014to be more modern than modern\u2014and so it was natural there should be a rapid shuffling of the philosophy as new challenges arose.\n\nSurrealists revived interest in Isidore Ducasse, known by his pseudonym [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont]], and for the line \"beautiful as the chance meeting on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella\", and [[Arthur Rimbaud]], two late 19th-century writers believed to be the precursors of Surrealism.\n\nExamples of Surrealist literature are Artaud's ''Le P\u00e8se-Nerfs'' (1926), Aragon's ''[[Irene's Cunt]]'' (1927), P\u00e9ret's ''Death to the Pigs'' (1929), Crevel's ''Mr. Knife Miss Fork'' (1931), [[Sadegh Hedayat]]'s ''[[the Blind Owl]]'' (1937), and Breton's ''Sur la route de San Romano'' (1948).\n\n''[[La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste]]'' continued publication into 1929 with most pages densely packed with columns of text, but also included reproductions of art, among them works by de Chirico, Ernst, Masson, and Man Ray. Other works included books, poems, pamphlets, automatic texts and theoretical tracts.\n\n===Surrealist films===\n{{Main|Surrealist cinema}}\nEarly films by Surrealists include:\n* ''[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]] (1924)\n* ''[[The Seashell and the Clergyman|La Coquille et le clergyman]]'' by [[Germaine Dulac]], screenplay by Antonin Artaud (1928)\n* ''[[L'\u00c9toile de mer]]'' by Man Ray (1928)\n* ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' by Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Salvador Dal\u00ed (1929)\n* ''[[L'\u00c2ge d'Or]]'' by Bu\u00f1uel and Dal\u00ed (1930)\n* ''[[The Blood of a Poet|Le sang d'un po\u00e8te]]'' by Jean Cocteau (1930)\n\n===Surrealist theatre===\nThe word ''surrealist'' was first used by Apollinaire to describe his 1917 play ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias|Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias]]'' (\"The Breasts of Tiresias\"), which was later [[Les mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias|adapted into an opera]] by [[Francis Poulenc]].\n\nAntonin Artaud, an early Surrealist, rejected the majority of Western theatre as a perversion of its original intent, which he felt should be a mystical, metaphysical experience. He thought that rational discourse comprised \"falsehood and illusion\". Theorising a new theatrical form that would be immediate and direct, that would link the unconscious minds of performers and spectators in a sort of ritual event, Artaud created the [[Theatre of Cruelty]], in which emotions, feelings, and the metaphysical were expressed not through language but physically, creating a mythological, archetypal, allegorical vision, closely related to the world of dreams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |title=The Theatre Of The Absurd |publisher=Arts.gla.ac.uk |date= |access-date=2009-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823075755/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |archive-date=2009-08-23 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holycross.edu/departments/theatre/eisser/semiotics.html |title=Artaud and Semiotics |publisher=Holycross.edu |date= |access-date=2009-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906153307/http://www.holycross.edu/departments/theatre/eisser/semiotics.html |archive-date=2008-09-06 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe other major theatre practitioner to have experimented with surrealism in the theatre is the Spanish playwright and director [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], particularly in his plays ''[[The Public (play)|The Public]]'' (1930), ''[[When Five Years Pass]]'' (1931), and ''[[Play Without a Title]]'' (1935). Other surrealist plays include Aragon's ''Backs to the Wall'' (1925) and [[Roger Vitrac]]'s ''The Mysteries of Love'' (1927) and ''Victor, or The Children Take Over'' (1928).<ref>Louis Aragon, ''Backs to the Wall'', in ''The Drama Review'' 18.4 (Dec. 1974): 88-107; Roger Vitrac, ''The Mysteries of Love'', in ''Theater of the Avant-Garde 1890-1950: A Critical Anthology.''

New Haven and London: Yale UP, 2001. 421-495.</ref>\n\n===Surrealist music===\n{{Main|Surrealist music}}\nIn the 1920s several composers were influenced by Surrealism, or by individuals in the Surrealist movement. Among them were [[Bohuslav Martin\u016f]], [[Andr\u00e9 Souris]], [[Erik Satie]], and [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]], who stated that his work ''Arcana'' was drawn from a dream sequence.<ref>Bernard, Jonathan W. \"Edgard Var\u00e9se's \u201cArcana\u201d.\" American Symphony Orchestra. Leon Botstein. Web. http://americansymphony.org/arcana/</ref> Souris in particular was associated with the movement: he had a long relationship with Magritte, and worked on [[Paul Noug\u00e9]]'s publication ''Adieu Marie''.\n\n[[Germaine Tailleferre]] of the French group [[Les Six]] wrote several works which could be considered to be inspired by Surrealism{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}, including the 1948 ballet ''Paris-Magie'' (scenario by [[Lise Deharme]]), the operas ''La Petite Sir\u00e8ne'' (book by Philippe Soupault) and ''Le Ma\u00eetre'' (book by Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco).<ref>[https://books.google.es/books?id=V-bSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT467&redir_esc=y Robert Shapiro, ''Les Six: The French Composers and Their Mentors Jean Cocteau and Erik Satie''.] London: Peter Owen, 2014. 467. {{ISBN|9780720617740}}</ref> Tailleferre also wrote popular songs to texts by Claude Marci, the wife of Henri Jeanson, whose portrait had been painted by Magritte in the 1930s.\n\nEven though Breton by 1946 responded rather negatively to the subject of music with his essay ''Silence is Golden'', later Surrealists, such as [[Paul Garon]], have been interested in\u2014and found parallels to\u2014Surrealism in the improvisation of [[jazz]] and the [[blues]]. Jazz and blues musicians have occasionally reciprocated this interest. For example, the [[1976 World Surrealist Exhibition]] included performances by [[David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards]].\n\n==Surrealism and international politics==\nSurrealism as a political force developed unevenly around the world: in some places more emphasis was on artistic practices, in other places on political practices, and in other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to supersede both the arts and politics. During the 1930s, the Surrealist idea spread from Europe to North America, South America (founding of the ''[[Mandr\u00e1gora]]'' group in Chile in 1938), [[Central America]], [[the Caribbean]], and throughout Asia, as both an artistic idea and as an ideology of political change.<ref name=\"Bauduin et al\">[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=135137902X Tessel M.

Breton and his comrades supported [[Leon Trotsky]] and his [[International Left Opposition]] for a while, though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II. Some Surrealists, such as [[Benjamin P\u00e9ret]], Mary Low, and Juan Bre\u00e1, aligned with forms of [[left communism]]. Others fought for complete liberty from political ideologies, like [[Wolfgang Paalen]], who, after Trotsky's assassination in Mexico, prepared a schism between art and politics through his counter-surrealist art-magazine [[DYN (magazine)|DYN]] and so prepared the ground for the abstract expressionists. Dal\u00ed supported capitalism and the fascist dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]] but cannot be said to represent a trend in Surrealism in this respect; in fact he was considered, by Breton and his associates, to have betrayed and left Surrealism. Benjamin P\u00e9ret, Mary Low and Juan Bre\u00e1 joined the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=\"Bauduin et al\" /><ref name=\"Spiteri\" />\n\nBreton's followers, along with the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]], were working for the \"liberation of man\". However, Breton's group refused to prioritize the [[proletarian]] struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the Party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both. Many individuals closely associated with Breton, notably Aragon, left his group to work more closely with the Communists.<ref name=\"Bauduin et al\" /><ref name=\"Spiteri\" />\n\nSurrealists have often sought to link their efforts with political ideals and activities. In the ''Declaration of January 27, 1925'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1925Surrealism.html |title=Modern History Sourcebook: A Surrealist Manifesto, 1925 |publisher=Fordham.edu |date=1925-01-27 |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> for example, members of the Paris-based [[Bureau of Surrealist Research]] (including Breton, Aragon and Artaud, as well as some two dozen others) declared their affinity for revolutionary politics. While this was initially a somewhat vague formulation, by the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism. The foremost document of this tendency within Surrealism is the ''Manifesto for a Free Revolutionary Art'',<ref>[http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcSurrealism1.html Generation-online.org]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref> published under the names of Breton and [[Diego Rivera]], but actually co-authored by Breton and [[Leon Trotsky]].<ref>Lewis, Helena.

A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1933 the Surrealists\u2019 assertion that a '[[proletarian literature]]' within a capitalist society was impossible led to their break with the Association des Ecrivains et Artistes R\u00e9volutionnaires, and the expulsion of Breton, \u00c9luard and Crevel from the Communist Party.<ref name=\"grove\"/>\n\nIn 1925, the Paris Surrealist group and the extreme left of the [[French Communist Party]] came together to support [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd-el-Krim]], leader of the [[Rif]] uprising against French colonialism in [[Morocco]]. In an open letter to writer and French ambassador to Japan, [[Paul Claudel]], the Paris group announced:\n\n:\"We Surrealists pronounced ourselves in favour of changing the imperialist war, in its chronic and colonial form, into a civil war. Thus we placed our energies at the disposal of the revolution, of the proletariat and its struggles, and defined our attitude towards the colonial problem, and hence towards the colour question.\"\n\nThe anticolonial revolutionary and proletarian politics of \"Murderous Humanitarianism\" (1932) which was drafted mainly by Crevel, signed by Breton, \u00c9luard, P\u00e9ret, Tanguy, and the Martiniquan Surrealists [[Pierre Yoyotte]] and [[J.M. Monnerot]] perhaps makes it the original document of what is later called 'black Surrealism',<ref>[[Robin Kelley|Kelley, Robin D.G.]] ''A Poetics of Anticolonialism''. November 1999.</ref> although it is the contact between [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] and Breton in the 1940s in [[Martinique]] that really lead to the communication of what is known as 'black Surrealism'.\n\nAnticolonial revolutionary writers in the [[N\u00e9gritude]] movement of [[Martinique]], a French colony at the time, took up Surrealism as a revolutionary method - a critique of European culture and a radical subjective. This linked with other Surrealists and was very important for the subsequent development of Surrealism as a revolutionary praxis. The journal ''[[Tropiques]]'', featuring the work of C\u00e9saire along with [[Suzanne C\u00e9saire]], [[Ren\u00e9 M\u00e9nil]], [[Lucie Th\u00e9s\u00e9e]], [[Aristide Maug\u00e9e]] and others, was first published in 1941.<ref>[[Robin Kelley|Kelley, Robin D.G.]] \"Poetry and the Political Imagination: Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, Negritude, & the Applications of Surrealism\". July 2001</ref>\n\nIn 1938 Andr\u00e9 Breton traveled with his wife, the painter [[Jacqueline Lamba]], to [[Mexico]] to meet Trotsky (staying as the guest of Diego Rivera's former wife Guadalupe Marin), and there he met [[Frida Kahlo]] and saw her paintings for the first time. Breton declared Kahlo to be an \"innate\" Surrealist painter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fridakahlofans.com/chronologyenglish.html |title=Frida Kahlo, Paintings, Chronology, Biography, Bio |publisher=Fridakahlofans.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref>\n\n===Internal politics===\nIn 1929 the satellite group associated with the journal ''Le Grand Jeu'', including [[Roger Gilbert-Lecomte]], [[Maurice Henry]] and the Czech painter [[Josef Sima]], was ostracized. Also in February, Breton asked Surrealists to assess their \"degree of moral competence\", and theoretical refinements included in the second ''[[Surrealist Manifesto|manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme]]'' excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective action, a list which included Leiris, Limbour, Morise, Baron, Queneau, Pr\u00e9vert, Desnos, Masson and Boiffard. Excluded members launched a counterattack, sharply criticizing Breton in the pamphlet ''[[Un Cadavre]]'', which featured a picture of Breton wearing a [[crown of thorns]]. The pamphlet drew upon an earlier act of subversion by likening Breton to [[Anatole France]], whose unquestioned value Breton had challenged in 1924.n\n\nThe disunion of 1929-30 and the effects of ''Un Cadavre'' had very little negative impact upon Surrealism as Breton saw it, since core figures such as Aragon, Crevel, Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel remained true the idea of group action, at least for the time being. The success (or the controversy) of Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel's film [[L'Age d'Or]] in December 1930 had a regenerative effect, drawing a number of new recruits, and encouraging countless new artistic works the following year and throughout the 1930s.\n\nDisgruntled surrealists moved to the periodical ''[[Documents (magazine)|Documents]]'', edited by [[Georges Bataille]], whose anti-idealist materialism formed a hybrid Surrealism intending to expose the base instincts of humans.<ref name=\"grove\"/><ref name=\"pompidou\">[http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm Surrealist Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918070327/http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm |date=2012-09-18 }} from [[Centre Pompidou]]. Retrieved March 20, 2007.</ref> To the dismay of many, ''Documents'' fizzled out in 1931, just as Surrealism seemed to be gathering more steam.\n\nThere were a number of reconciliations after this period of disunion, such as between Breton and Bataille, while Aragon left the group after committing himself to the [[French Communist Party]] in 1932. More members were ousted over the years for a variety of infractions, both political and personal, while others left in pursuit of their own style.\n\nBy the end of World War II the surrealist group led by Andr\u00e9 Breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote \"It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself.\"<ref name=\"anarchosurrealism\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/1919-1950-the-politics-of-surrealism |title=1919-1950: The politics of Surrealism by Nick Heath |publisher=Libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> \"Breton was consistent in his support for the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Anarchiste|francophone Anarchist Federation]] and he continued to offer his solidarity after the [[Platformism|Platformists]] supporting Fontenis transformed the FA into the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Communiste Libertaire.

He refused to take sides on the splits in the French anarchist movement and both he and Peret expressed solidarity as well with the new [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration anarchiste]] set up by the synthesist anarchists and worked in the Antifascist Committees of the 60s alongside the FA.\"<ref name=\"anarchosurrealism\"/>\n\n==Golden age==\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:The Persistence of Memory.jpg|thumb|[[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'' (1931), [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[Manhattan]]]] -->\nThroughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in London]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Another English Surrealist group developed [[Birmingham Surrealists|in Birmingham]], meanwhile, and was distinguished by its opposition to the London surrealists and preferences for surrealism's French heartland. The two groups would reconcile later in the decade.\n\nDal\u00ed and Magritte created the most widely recognized images of the movement. Dal\u00ed joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.\n\nSurrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth; stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, in order to evoke empathy from the viewer.\n\n1931 was a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: Magritte's ''Voice of Space (La Voix des airs)''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/2593?tmpl=component&print=1 |title=Surrealism - Magritte - Voice of Space |publisher=Guggenheim Collection |date= |access-date=2009-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319041151/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/2593?tmpl=component&print=1 |archive-date=2015-03-19 |df= }}</ref> is an example of this process, where three large spheres representing bells hang above a landscape. Another Surrealist landscape from this same year is Yves Tanguy's ''[[:File:Premontory Palace.jpg|Promontory Palace (Palais promontoire)]]'', with its molten forms and liquid shapes. Liquid shapes became the trademark of Dal\u00ed, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they were melting.\n\nThe characteristics of this style\u2014a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological\u2014came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[modernism|modern]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be \"made whole with one's individuality\".\n\nBetween 1930 and 1933, the Surrealist Group in Paris issued the periodical ''[[Le Surr\u00e9alisme au service de la r\u00e9volution]]'' as the successor of ''La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste''.\n\nFrom 1936 through 1938 [[Wolfgang Paalen]], [[Gordon Onslow Ford]], and [[Roberto Matta]] joined the group. Paalen contributed [[Fumage]] and Onslow Ford [[Coulage]] as new pictorial automatic techniques.\n\nLong after personal, political and professional tensions fragmented the Surrealist group, Magritte and Dal\u00ed continued to define a visual program in the arts. This program reached beyond painting, to encompass photography as well, as can be seen from a Man Ray self-portrait, whose use of assemblage influenced [[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s collage boxes.\n[[File:L'Ange du Foyeur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Ernst]], ''L'Ange du Foyer ou le Triomphe du Surr\u00e9alisme'' (1937), private collection.]]\nDuring the 1930s [[Peggy Guggenheim]], an important American art collector, married Max Ernst and began promoting work by other Surrealists such as Yves Tanguy and the British artist [[John Tunnard]].\n\n'''Major exhibitions in the 1930s'''\n* 1936 - ''[[London International Surrealist Exhibition]]'' is organised in London by the art historian [[Herbert Read]], with an introduction by Andr\u00e9 Breton.\n* 1936 - [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York shows the exhibition ''[[Fantastic Art]], Dada and Surrealism''.\n* 1938 - A new ''[[Exposition Internationale du Surr\u00e9alisme]]'' was held at the Beaux-arts Gallery, Paris, with more than 60 artists from different countries, and showed around 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs and installations. The Surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act and called on Marcel Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray and others to do so. At the exhibition's entrance Salvador Dal\u00ed placed his [[Rainy Taxi]] (an old taxi rigged to produce a steady drizzle of water down the inside of the windows, and a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat and a blond mannequin crawling with live snails in the back) greeted the patrons who were in full evening dress. ''Surrealist Street'' filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various Surrealists. Paalen and Duchamp designed the main hall to seem like cave with 1,200 coal bags suspended from the ceiling over a coal brazier with a single light bulb which provided the only lighting, as well as the floor covered with humid leaves and mud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_8.html |title=Marcel Duchamp |publisher=Toutfait.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> The patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art. On the floor Wolfgang Paalen created a small lake with grasses and the aroma of roasting coffee filled the air. Much to the Surrealists' satisfaction the exhibition scandalized the viewers.<ref name=\"tomkins\"/>\n\n===World War II and the Post War period===\n[[File:Indefinite Divisibility.jpg|thumb|[[Yves Tanguy]] ''Indefinite Divisibility'' 1942, [[Albright Knox Art Gallery]], Buffalo, New York]]\nWorld War II created havoc not only for the general population of Europe but especially for the European artists and writers that opposed Fascism and Nazism. Many important artists fled to North America and relative safety in the United States. The art community in New York City in particular was already grappling with Surrealist ideas and several artists like [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Robert Motherwell]] converged closely with the surrealist artists themselves, albeit with some suspicion and reservations. Ideas concerning the unconscious and dream imagery were quickly embraced. By the Second World War, the taste of the American [[avant-garde]] in New York City swung decisively towards [[Abstract Expressionism]] with the support of key taste makers, including [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Leo Steinberg]] and [[Clement Greenberg]]. However, it should not be easily forgotten that Abstract Expressionism itself grew directly out of the meeting of American (particularly New York) artists with European Surrealists self-exiled during World War II. In particular, Gorky and Paalen influenced the development of this American art form, which, as Surrealism did, celebrated the instantaneous human act as the well-spring of creativity. The early work of many Abstract Expressionists reveals a tight bond between the more superficial aspects of both movements, and the emergence (at a later date) of aspects of [[Dadaist]]ic humor in such artists as [[Rauschenberg]] sheds an even starker light upon the connection. Up until the emergence of [[Pop Art]], Surrealism can be seen to have been the single most important influence on the sudden growth in American arts, and even in Pop, some of the humor manifested in Surrealism can be found, often turned to a cultural criticism.\n\nThe Second World War overshadowed, for a time, almost all intellectual and artistic production. In 1939 Wolfgang Paalen was the first to leave Paris for the New World as exile. After a long trip through the forests of British Columbia, he settled in Mexico and founded his influential art-magazine [[DYN (journal)|Dyn]]. In 1940 Yves Tanguy married American Surrealist painter [[Kay Sage]]. In 1941, Breton went to the United States, where he co-founded the short-lived magazine ''[[VVV (magazine)|VVV]]'' with Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, and the American artist [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]]. However, it was the American poet, [[Charles Henri Ford]], and his magazine ''[[View (magazine)|View]]'' which offered Breton a channel for promoting Surrealism in the United States. The ''View'' special issue on Duchamp was crucial for the public understanding of Surrealism in America. It stressed his connections to Surrealist methods, offered interpretations of his work by Breton, as well as Breton's view that Duchamp represented the bridge between early modern movements, such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] and [[Cubism]], to Surrealism. Wolfgang Paalen left the group in 1942 due to political/philosophical differences with Breton.\n\nThough the war proved disruptive for Surrealism, the works continued. Many Surrealist artists continued to explore their vocabularies, including Magritte. Many members of the Surrealist movement continued to correspond and meet. While Dal\u00ed may have been excommunicated by Breton, he neither abandoned his themes from the 1930s, including references to the \"persistence of time\" in a later painting, nor did he become a depictive pompier. His classic period did not represent so sharp a break with the past as some descriptions of his work might portray, and some, such as [[Andr\u00e9 Thirion]], argued that there were works of his after this period that continued to have some relevance for the movement.\n\nDuring the 1940s Surrealism's influence was also felt in England, America and the Netherlands where Gertrude Pape and her husband Theo van Baaren helped to popularize it in their publication The Clean Handkerchief.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Surrealist women : an international anthology|date=1998|publisher=University of Texas Press|others=Rosemont, Penelope.|isbn=978-0292770881|edition=1st|location=Austin|oclc=37782914|url=https://archive.org/details/surrealistwomeni00rose}}</ref> [[Mark Rothko]] took an interest in [[biomorphism|biomorphic]] figures, and in England [[Henry Moore]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] used or experimented with Surrealist techniques. However, [[Conroy Maddox]], one of the first British Surrealists whose work in this genre dated from 1935, remained within the movement, and organized an exhibition of current Surrealist work in 1978 in response to an earlier show which infuriated him because it did not properly represent Surrealism. Maddox's exhibition, titled ''Surrealism Unlimited'', was held in Paris and attracted international attention. He held his last one-man show in 2002, and died three years later.\nMagritte's work became more realistic in its depiction of actual objects, while maintaining the element of juxtaposition, such as in 1951's ''Personal Values (Les Valeurs Personnelles)''<ref>[http://www.sfmoma.org/MSoMA/newAWScreen.asp?awScreenNum=5139 SFmoma.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001014708/http://www.sfmoma.org/MSoMA/newAWScreen.asp?awScreenNum=5139 |date=October 1, 2008 }}</ref> and 1954's ''Empire of Light  (L\u2019Empire des lumi\u00e8res)''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/2594 |title=Artist - Magritte - Empire of Light - Large |publisher=Guggenheim Collection |date= January 1953|accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> Magritte continued to produce works which have entered artistic vocabulary, such as ''Castle in the Pyrenees (Le Ch\u00e2teau des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es)'',<ref>[https://artacademieparis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/magritte_Castle-in-the-Pyrenees.jpg Artacademieparis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510184620/https://artacademieparis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/magritte_Castle-in-the-Pyrenees.jpg |date=2018-05-10 }}</ref> which refers back to ''Voix'' from 1931, in its suspension over a landscape.\n\nOther figures from the Surrealist movement were expelled. Several of these artists, like [[Roberto Matta]] (by his own description) \"remained close to Surrealism\".<ref name=\"tomkins\"/>\n\nAfter the crushing of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], [[Endre Rozsda]] returned to Paris to continue creating his own word that had been transcended the surrealism. The preface to his first exhibition in the Furstenberg Gallery (1957) was written by Breton yet.<ref name=\"breton\">Breton, Andr\u00e9. ''Surrealism and Painting'', Icon, 1973</ref>\n\nMany new artists explicitly took up the Surrealist banner. [[Dorothea Tanning]] and [[Louise Bourgeois]] continued to work, for example, with Tanning's ''Rainy Day Canape'' from 1970. Duchamp continued to produce sculpture in secret including an installation with the realistic depiction of a woman viewable only through a peephole.\n\nBreton continued to write and espouse the importance of liberating the human mind, as with the publication ''[[The Tower of Light]]'' in 1952. Breton's return to France after the War, began a new phase of Surrealist activity in Paris, and his critiques of rationalism and dualism found a new audience. Breton insisted that Surrealism was an ongoing revolt against the reduction of humanity to market relationships, religious gestures and misery and to espouse the importance of liberating the human mind.\n\n'''Major exhibitions of the 1940s, '50s and '60s'''\n* 1942 - ''First Papers of Surrealism'' - New York - The Surrealists again called on Duchamp to design an exhibition. This time he wove a 3-dimensional web of string throughout the rooms of the space, in some cases making it almost impossible to see the works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_9.html |title=Marcel Duchamp |publisher=Toutfait.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> He made a secret arrangement with an associate's son to bring his friends to the opening of the show, so that when the finely dressed patrons arrived they found a dozen children in athletic clothes kicking and passing balls, and skipping rope.

While [[Guy Debord]] was critical of and distanced himself from Surrealism, others, such as [[Asger Jorn]], were explicitly using Surrealist techniques and methods. [[May 1968 events in France|The events of May 1968]] in France included a number of Surrealist ideas, and among the slogans the students spray-painted on the walls of the Sorbonne were familiar Surrealist ones. [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] would commemorate this in a painting titled ''May 1968.'' There were also groups who associated with both currents and were more attached to Surrealism, such as the [[Revolutionary Surrealist Group]].\n\nDuring the 1980s, behind the [[Iron Curtain]], Surrealism again entered into politics with an underground artistic opposition movement known as the [[Orange Alternative]]. The Orange Alternative was created in 1981 by [[Waldemar Fydrych]] (alias 'Major'), a graduate of history and art history at the University of [[Wroc\u0142aw]]. They used Surrealist symbolism and terminology in their large scale happenings organized in the major Polish cities during the [[Jaruzelski]] regime, and painted Surrealist graffiti on spots covering up anti-regime slogans. Major himself was the author of a \"Manifesto of Socialist Surrealism\". In this manifesto, he stated that the socialist (communist) system had become so Surrealistic that it could be seen as an expression of art itself.\n\nSurrealistic art also remains popular with museum patrons. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City held an exhibit, ''Two Private Eyes'', in 1999, and in 2001 [[Tate Modern]] held an exhibition of Surrealist art that attracted over 170,000 visitors. In 2002 the [[Metropolitan Museum|Met]] in New York City held a show, ''Desire Unbound'', and the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris a show called ''La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste''.\n\nSurrealists groups and literary publications have continued to be active up to the present day, with groups such as the [[Chicago Surrealist Group]], the Leeds Surrealist Group, and the Surrealist Group of Stockholm. [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]] of the Czech-Slovak Surrealists continues to make films and experiment with objects.\n\n==Impact of Surrealism==\nWhile Surrealism is typically associated with the arts, it has impacted many other fields. In this sense, Surrealism does not specifically refer only to self-identified \"Surrealists\", or those sanctioned by Breton, rather, it refers to a range of creative acts of revolt and efforts to liberate imagination.<ref>Vaneigem, Raoul (Dupuis Jules-Fran\u00e7ois), ''Histoire d\u00e9sinvolte du surr\u00e9alisme''.

One might say that Surrealist strands may be found in movements such as [[Free Jazz]] ([[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Cecil Taylor]] etc.) and even in the daily lives of people in confrontation with limiting social conditions.

The original Paris Surrealist Group was disbanded by member Jean Schuster in 1969, but another Parisian surrealist group was later formed. The current Surrealist Group of Paris has recently published the first issue of their new journal, ''Alcheringa''. The Group of Czech-Slovak Surrealists never disbanded, and continue to publish their journal ''Analogon'', which now spans 80 volumes.\n\n===Surrealism and the theatre===\nSurrealist theatre and Artaud's \"Theatre of Cruelty\" were inspirational to many within the group of playwrights that the critic Martin Esslin called the \"[[Theatre of the Absurd]]\" (in his 1963 book of the same name). Though not an organized movement, Esslin grouped these playwrights together based on some similarities of theme and technique; Esslin argues that these similarities may be traced to an influence from the Surrealists. [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] in particular was fond of Surrealism, claiming at one point that Breton was one of the most important thinkers in history.<ref>Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco.

Modern psychology may explain the appeal Bosch's pictures have for us, but it cannot explain the meaning they had for Bosch and his contemporaries.

The Dadaists protested with [[anti-art]] gatherings, performances, writings and art works. After the war, when they returned to Paris, the Dada activities continued.\n\nDuring the war, [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], who had trained in medicine and psychiatry, served in a [[Neurology|neurological]] hospital where he used [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic methods with soldiers suffering from [[shell-shock]]. Meeting the young writer [[Jacques Vach\u00e9]], Breton felt that Vach\u00e9 was the spiritual son of writer and [[pataphysics]] founder [[Alfred Jarry]].  He admired the young writer's anti-social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition. Later Breton wrote, \"In literature, I was successively taken with [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], with Jarry, with Apollinaire, with [[Germain Nouveau|Nouveau]], with [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont|Lautr\u00e9amont]], but it is Jacques Vach\u00e9 to whom I owe the most.\"<ref>Breton, \"Vach\u00e9 is surrealist in me\", in ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''.</ref>\n\nBack in Paris, Breton joined in Dada activities and started the literary journal ''[[Litt\u00e9rature (magazine)|Litt\u00e9rature]]'' along with [[Louis Aragon]] and [[Philippe Soupault]]. They began experimenting with [[Surrealist automatism|automatic writing]]\u2014spontaneously writing without censoring their thoughts\u2014and published the writings, as well as accounts of dreams, in the magazine. Breton and Soupault continued writing evolving their techniques of automatism and published ''[[Les Champs Magn\u00e9tiques|The Magnetic Fields]]'' (1920).\n\nBy October 1924 two rival Surrealist groups had formed to publish a [[Surrealist Manifesto]]. Each claimed to be successors of a revolution launched by Appolinaire. One group, led by [[Yvan Goll]] consisted of [[Pierre Albert-Birot]], [[Paul Derm\u00e9e]], [[C\u00e9line Arnauld]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], [[Marcel Arland]], [[Joseph Delteil]], [[Jean Painlev\u00e9]] and [[Robert Delaunay]], among others<ref>G\u00e9rard Durozoi, An excerpt from History of the Surrealist Movement, Chapter Two, 1924-1929, Salvation for Us Is Nowhere, translation by Alison Anderson, U of Chicago Press, pp. 63-74, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-226-17411-2}}.</ref> The group led by Andr\u00e9 Breton claimed that [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] was a better tactic for societal change than those of Dada, as led by Tzara, who was now among their rivals.

They embraced [[idiosyncrasy]], while rejecting the idea of an underlying madness. As Dal\u00ed later proclaimed, \"There is only one difference between a madman and me. I am not mad.\"<ref name=\"Diary of a Genius\"/>\n\nBeside the use of dream analysis, they emphasized that \"one could combine inside the same frame, elements not normally found together to produce illogical and startling effects.\"<ref name=\"PynchonSurralism\"/> Breton included the idea of the startling juxtapositions in his 1924 manifesto, taking it in turn from a 1918 essay by poet [[Pierre Reverdy]], which said: \"a juxtaposition of two more or less distant realities.

They wanted to free people from false rationality, and restrictive customs and structures. Breton proclaimed that the true aim of Surrealism was \"long live the social revolution, and it alone!\" To this goal, at various times Surrealists aligned with [[communism]] and [[anarchism]].\n\nIn 1924 two Surrealist factions declared their philosophy in two separate Surrealist Manifestos.

He included citations of the influences on Surrealism, examples of Surrealist works, and discussion of Surrealist automatism. He provided the following definitions:\n\n{{quotation|'''Dictionary:''' Surrealism, n.

Breton initially doubted that visual arts could even be useful in the Surrealist movement since they appeared to be less malleable and open to chance and [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]]. This caution was overcome by the discovery of such techniques as [[frottage (art)|frottage]] and [[decalcomania]].\n\nSoon more visual artists became involved, including [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Valentine Hugo]], [[M\u00e9ret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Kansuke Yamamoto (artist)|Kansuke Yamamoto]] and later after the second war: [[Enrico Donati]]. Though Breton admired [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] and courted them to join the movement, they remained peripheral.<ref name=\"tomkins\">[[Calvin Tomkins|Tomkins, Calvin]], ''Duchamp: A Biography''. Henry Holt and Company, Inc, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8050-5789-7}}</ref> More writers also joined, including former Dadaist [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Ren\u00e9 Char]], and [[Georges Sadoul]].\n\n[[File:Masson automatic drawing.jpg|thumb|[[Andr\u00e9 Masson]]. Automatic Drawing. 1924. Ink on paper, 23.5 x 20.6 cm. [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.]]\nIn 1925 an autonomous Surrealist group formed in Brussels. The group included the musician, poet, and artist [[E. L. T. Mesens]], painter and writer [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]], [[Paul Noug\u00e9]], [[Marcel Lecomte]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Souris]]. In 1927 they were joined by the writer [[Louis Scutenaire]]. They corresponded regularly with the Paris group, and in 1927 both Goemans and Magritte moved to Paris and frequented Breton's circle.<ref name=\"grove\"/> The artists, with their roots in [[Dada]] and [[Cubism]], the abstraction of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Expressionism]], and [[Post-Impressionism]], also reached to older \"bloodlines\" or [[Proto-Surrealism|proto-surrealists]] such as [[Hieronymus Bosch]], and the so-called primitive and naive arts.\n\n[[Andr\u00e9 Masson]]'s [[automatic drawing]]s of 1923 are often used as the point of the acceptance of visual arts and the break from Dada, since they reflect the influence of the idea of the [[unconscious mind]]. Another example is Giacometti's 1925 ''Torso'', which marked his movement to simplified forms and inspiration from preclassical sculpture.\n\nHowever, a striking example of the line used to divide Dada and Surrealism among art experts is the pairing of 1925's [[Little Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person|''Little Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person (Von minimax dadamax selbst konstruiertes maschinchen)'']]<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1129 Link to Guggenheim collection] with reproduction of the painting and further information.</ref> with ''The Kiss (Le Baiser)''<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1132 Link to Guggenheim collection] with reproduction of the painting and further information.</ref> from 1927 by Max Ernst. The first is generally held to have a distance, and erotic subtext, whereas the second presents an erotic act openly and directly. In the second the influence of [[Joan Mir\u00f3|Mir\u00f3]] and the drawing style of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] is visible with the use of fluid curving and intersecting lines and colour, whereas the first takes a directness that would later be influential in movements such as [[Pop art]].\n[[File:The Red Tower.jpg|left|thumb|[[Giorgio de Chirico]], ''The Red Tower (La Tour Rouge)'', 1913, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]]]\nGiorgio de Chirico, and his previous development of [[metaphysical art]], was one of the important joining figures between the philosophical and visual aspects of Surrealism. Between 1911 and 1917, he adopted an unornamented depictional style whose surface would be adopted by others later. ''The Red Tower (La tour rouge)'' from 1913 shows the stark colour contrasts and illustrative style later adopted by Surrealist painters. His 1914 ''The Nostalgia of the Poet (La Nostalgie du po\u00e8te)''<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/854 Link to Guggenheim collection] with reproduction of the painting and further information.</ref> has the figure turned away from the viewer, and the juxtaposition of a bust with glasses and a fish as a relief defies conventional explanation. He was also a writer whose novel ''[[Hebdomeros]]'' presents a series of dreamscapes with an unusual use of punctuation, syntax, and grammar designed to create an atmosphere and frame its images. His images, including set designs for the [[Ballets Russes]], would create a decorative form of Surrealism, and he would be an influence on the two artists who would be even more closely associated with Surrealism in the public mind: Dal\u00ed and Magritte. He would, however, leave the Surrealist group in 1928.\n\nIn 1924, Mir\u00f3 and Masson applied Surrealism to painting. The first Surrealist exhibition, ''La Peinture Surrealiste'', was held at Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. It displayed works by Masson, [[Man Ray]], [[Paul Klee]], Mir\u00f3, and others. The show confirmed that Surrealism had a component in the visual arts (though it had been initially debated whether this was possible), and techniques from Dada, such as [[photomontage]], were used. The following year, on March 26, 1926 Galerie Surr\u00e9aliste opened  with an exhibition by Man Ray. Breton published ''Surrealism and Painting'' in 1928 which summarized the movement to that point, though he continued to update the work until the 1960s.\n\n===Surrealist literature===\n{{See also|List of Surrealist poets}}\n[[File:MagrittePipe.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Treachery of Images]]'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]] (1929), featuring the famous declaration, \"This is not a pipe.\" [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]]]\n\nThe first Surrealist work, according to leader Br\u00eaton, was [[Les Chants de Maldoror]];<ref>Br\u00eaton, Andr\u00e9. ''Communicating Vessels''. Trans. Mary Ann Caws & Geoffrey T. Harris. London & Lincoln: U of Nebraska Press/Bison Books, 1990.</ref> and the first work written and published by his group of ''Surr\u00e9alistes'' was ''[[Les Champs Magn\u00e9tiques]]'' (May\u2013June 1919).<ref>Br\u00eaton, Andr\u00e9. Les Vases communicants. Paris: Gallimard, 1955.</ref> ''Litt\u00e9rature'' contained automatist works and accounts of dreams. The magazine and the portfolio both showed their disdain for literal meanings given to objects and focused rather on the undertones, the poetic undercurrents present. Not only did they give emphasis to the poetic undercurrents, but also to the connotations and the overtones which \"exist in ambiguous relationships to the visual images\"<ref>Vaneigem, Raoul. A Cavalier History of Surrealism. Trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith. Oakland: AK Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nBecause Surrealist writers seldom, if ever, appear to organize their thoughts and the images they present, some people find much of their work difficult to parse. This notion however is a superficial comprehension, prompted no doubt by Breton's initial emphasis on automatic writing as the main route toward a higher reality. But\u2014as in Breton's case\u2014much of what is presented as purely automatic is actually edited and very \"thought out\". Breton himself later admitted that automatic writing's centrality had been overstated, and other elements were introduced, especially as the growing involvement of visual artists in the movement forced the issue, since automatic painting required a rather more strenuous set of approaches. Thus such elements as collage were introduced, arising partly from an ideal of startling juxtapositions as revealed in [[Pierre Reverdy]]'s poetry. And\u2014as in Magritte's case (where there is no obvious recourse to either automatic techniques or collage)\u2014the very notion of convulsive joining became a tool for revelation in and of itself. Surrealism was meant to be always in flux\u2014to be more modern than modern\u2014and so it was natural there should be a rapid shuffling of the philosophy as new challenges arose.\n\nSurrealists revived interest in Isidore Ducasse, known by his pseudonym [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont]], and for the line \"beautiful as the chance meeting on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella\", and [[Arthur Rimbaud]], two late 19th-century writers believed to be the precursors of Surrealism.\n\nExamples of Surrealist literature are Artaud's ''Le P\u00e8se-Nerfs'' (1926), Aragon's ''[[Irene's Cunt]]'' (1927), P\u00e9ret's ''Death to the Pigs'' (1929), Crevel's ''Mr. Knife Miss Fork'' (1931), [[Sadegh Hedayat]]'s ''[[the Blind Owl]]'' (1937), and Breton's ''Sur la route de San Romano'' (1948).\n\n''[[La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste]]'' continued publication into 1929 with most pages densely packed with columns of text, but also included reproductions of art, among them works by de Chirico, Ernst, Masson, and Man Ray. Other works included books, poems, pamphlets, automatic texts and theoretical tracts.\n\n===Surrealist films===\n{{Main|Surrealist cinema}}\nEarly films by Surrealists include:\n* ''[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]] (1924)\n* ''[[The Seashell and the Clergyman|La Coquille et le clergyman]]'' by [[Germaine Dulac]], screenplay by Antonin Artaud (1928)\n* ''[[L'\u00c9toile de mer]]'' by Man Ray (1928)\n* ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' by Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Salvador Dal\u00ed (1929)\n* ''[[L'\u00c2ge d'Or]]'' by Bu\u00f1uel and Dal\u00ed (1930)\n* ''[[The Blood of a Poet|Le sang d'un po\u00e8te]]'' by Jean Cocteau (1930)\n\n===Surrealist theatre===\nThe word ''surrealist'' was first used by Apollinaire to describe his 1917 play ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias|Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias]]'' (\"The Breasts of Tiresias\"), which was later [[Les mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias|adapted into an opera]] by [[Francis Poulenc]].\n\nAntonin Artaud, an early Surrealist, rejected the majority of Western theatre as a perversion of its original intent, which he felt should be a mystical, metaphysical experience. He thought that rational discourse comprised \"falsehood and illusion\". Theorising a new theatrical form that would be immediate and direct, that would link the unconscious minds of performers and spectators in a sort of ritual event, Artaud created the [[Theatre of Cruelty]], in which emotions, feelings, and the metaphysical were expressed not through language but physically, creating a mythological, archetypal, allegorical vision, closely related to the world of dreams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |title=The Theatre Of The Absurd |publisher=Arts.gla.ac.uk |date= |access-date=2009-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823075755/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |archive-date=2009-08-23 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holycross.edu/departments/theatre/eisser/semiotics.html |title=Artaud and Semiotics |publisher=Holycross.edu |date= |access-date=2009-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906153307/http://www.holycross.edu/departments/theatre/eisser/semiotics.html |archive-date=2008-09-06 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe other major theatre practitioner to have experimented with surrealism in the theatre is the Spanish playwright and director [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], particularly in his plays ''[[The Public (play)|The Public]]'' (1930), ''[[When Five Years Pass]]'' (1931), and ''[[Play Without a Title]]'' (1935).

Jazz and blues musicians have occasionally reciprocated this interest. For example, the [[1976 World Surrealist Exhibition]] included performances by [[David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards]].\n\n==Surrealism and international politics==\nSurrealism as a political force developed unevenly around the world: in some places more emphasis was on artistic practices, in other places on political practices, and in other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to supersede both the arts and politics. During the 1930s, the Surrealist idea spread from Europe to North America, South America (founding of the ''[[Mandr\u00e1gora]]'' group in Chile in 1938), [[Central America]], [[the Caribbean]], and throughout Asia, as both an artistic idea and as an ideology of political change.<ref name=\"Bauduin et al\">[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=135137902X Tessel M.

Breton and his comrades supported [[Leon Trotsky]] and his [[International Left Opposition]] for a while, though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II. Some Surrealists, such as [[Benjamin P\u00e9ret]], Mary Low, and Juan Bre\u00e1, aligned with forms of [[left communism]]. Others fought for complete liberty from political ideologies, like [[Wolfgang Paalen]], who, after Trotsky's assassination in Mexico, prepared a schism between art and politics through his counter-surrealist art-magazine [[DYN (magazine)|DYN]] and so prepared the ground for the abstract expressionists. Dal\u00ed supported capitalism and the fascist dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]] but cannot be said to represent a trend in Surrealism in this respect; in fact he was considered, by Breton and his associates, to have betrayed and left Surrealism. Benjamin P\u00e9ret, Mary Low and Juan Bre\u00e1 joined the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=\"Bauduin et al\" /><ref name=\"Spiteri\" />\n\nBreton's followers, along with the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]], were working for the \"liberation of man\". However, Breton's group refused to prioritize the [[proletarian]] struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the Party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both. Many individuals closely associated with Breton, notably Aragon, left his group to work more closely with the Communists.<ref name=\"Bauduin et al\" /><ref name=\"Spiteri\" />\n\nSurrealists have often sought to link their efforts with political ideals and activities. In the ''Declaration of January 27, 1925'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1925Surrealism.html |title=Modern History Sourcebook: A Surrealist Manifesto, 1925 |publisher=Fordham.edu |date=1925-01-27 |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> for example, members of the Paris-based [[Bureau of Surrealist Research]] (including Breton, Aragon and Artaud, as well as some two dozen others) declared their affinity for revolutionary politics. While this was initially a somewhat vague formulation, by the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism. The foremost document of this tendency within Surrealism is the ''Manifesto for a Free Revolutionary Art'',<ref>[http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcSurrealism1.html Generation-online.org]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref> published under the names of Breton and [[Diego Rivera]], but actually co-authored by Breton and [[Leon Trotsky]].<ref>Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1933 the Surrealists\u2019 assertion that a '[[proletarian literature]]' within a capitalist society was impossible led to their break with the Association des Ecrivains et Artistes R\u00e9volutionnaires, and the expulsion of Breton, \u00c9luard and Crevel from the Communist Party.<ref name=\"grove\"/>\n\nIn 1925, the Paris Surrealist group and the extreme left of the [[French Communist Party]] came together to support [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd-el-Krim]], leader of the [[Rif]] uprising against French colonialism in [[Morocco]]. In an open letter to writer and French ambassador to Japan, [[Paul Claudel]], the Paris group announced:\n\n:\"We Surrealists pronounced ourselves in favour of changing the imperialist war, in its chronic and colonial form, into a civil war. Thus we placed our energies at the disposal of the revolution, of the proletariat and its struggles, and defined our attitude towards the colonial problem, and hence towards the colour question.\"\n\nThe anticolonial revolutionary and proletarian politics of \"Murderous Humanitarianism\" (1932) which was drafted mainly by Crevel, signed by Breton, \u00c9luard, P\u00e9ret, Tanguy, and the Martiniquan Surrealists [[Pierre Yoyotte]] and [[J.M. Monnerot]] perhaps makes it the original document of what is later called 'black Surrealism',<ref>[[Robin Kelley|Kelley, Robin D.G.]] ''A Poetics of Anticolonialism''. November 1999.</ref> although it is the contact between [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] and Breton in the 1940s in [[Martinique]] that really lead to the communication of what is known as 'black Surrealism'.\n\nAnticolonial revolutionary writers in the [[N\u00e9gritude]] movement of [[Martinique]], a French colony at the time, took up Surrealism as a revolutionary method - a critique of European culture and a radical subjective. This linked with other Surrealists and was very important for the subsequent development of Surrealism as a revolutionary praxis. The journal ''[[Tropiques]]'', featuring the work of C\u00e9saire along with [[Suzanne C\u00e9saire]], [[Ren\u00e9 M\u00e9nil]], [[Lucie Th\u00e9s\u00e9e]], [[Aristide Maug\u00e9e]] and others, was first published in 1941.<ref>[[Robin Kelley|Kelley, Robin D.G.]] \"Poetry and the Political Imagination: Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, Negritude, & the Applications of Surrealism\". July 2001</ref>\n\nIn 1938 Andr\u00e9 Breton traveled with his wife, the painter [[Jacqueline Lamba]], to [[Mexico]] to meet Trotsky (staying as the guest of Diego Rivera's former wife Guadalupe Marin), and there he met [[Frida Kahlo]] and saw her paintings for the first time. Breton declared Kahlo to be an \"innate\" Surrealist painter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fridakahlofans.com/chronologyenglish.html |title=Frida Kahlo, Paintings, Chronology, Biography, Bio |publisher=Fridakahlofans.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref>\n\n===Internal politics===\nIn 1929 the satellite group associated with the journal ''Le Grand Jeu'', including [[Roger Gilbert-Lecomte]], [[Maurice Henry]] and the Czech painter [[Josef Sima]], was ostracized. Also in February, Breton asked Surrealists to assess their \"degree of moral competence\", and theoretical refinements included in the second ''[[Surrealist Manifesto|manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme]]'' excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective action, a list which included Leiris, Limbour, Morise, Baron, Queneau, Pr\u00e9vert, Desnos, Masson and Boiffard. Excluded members launched a counterattack, sharply criticizing Breton in the pamphlet ''[[Un Cadavre]]'', which featured a picture of Breton wearing a [[crown of thorns]]. The pamphlet drew upon an earlier act of subversion by likening Breton to [[Anatole France]], whose unquestioned value Breton had challenged in 1924.n\n\nThe disunion of 1929-30 and the effects of ''Un Cadavre'' had very little negative impact upon Surrealism as Breton saw it, since core figures such as Aragon, Crevel, Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel remained true the idea of group action, at least for the time being. The success (or the controversy) of Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel's film [[L'Age d'Or]] in December 1930 had a regenerative effect, drawing a number of new recruits, and encouraging countless new artistic works the following year and throughout the 1930s.\n\nDisgruntled surrealists moved to the periodical ''[[Documents (magazine)|Documents]]'', edited by [[Georges Bataille]], whose anti-idealist materialism formed a hybrid Surrealism intending to expose the base instincts of humans.<ref name=\"grove\"/><ref name=\"pompidou\">[http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm Surrealist Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918070327/http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm |date=2012-09-18 }} from [[Centre Pompidou]]. Retrieved March 20, 2007.</ref> To the dismay of many, ''Documents'' fizzled out in 1931, just as Surrealism seemed to be gathering more steam.\n\nThere were a number of reconciliations after this period of disunion, such as between Breton and Bataille, while Aragon left the group after committing himself to the [[French Communist Party]] in 1932. More members were ousted over the years for a variety of infractions, both political and personal, while others left in pursuit of their own style.\n\nBy the end of World War II the surrealist group led by Andr\u00e9 Breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote \"It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself.\"<ref name=\"anarchosurrealism\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/1919-1950-the-politics-of-surrealism |title=1919-1950: The politics of Surrealism by Nick Heath |publisher=Libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> \"Breton was consistent in his support for the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Anarchiste|francophone Anarchist Federation]] and he continued to offer his solidarity after the [[Platformism|Platformists]] supporting Fontenis transformed the FA into the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Communiste Libertaire. He was one of the few intellectuals who continued to offer his support to the FCL during the Algerian war when the FCL suffered severe repression and was forced underground. He sheltered Fontenis whilst he was in hiding. He refused to take sides on the splits in the French anarchist movement and both he and Peret expressed solidarity as well with the new [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration anarchiste]] set up by the synthesist anarchists and worked in the Antifascist Committees of the 60s alongside the FA.\"<ref name=\"anarchosurrealism\"/>\n\n==Golden age==\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:The Persistence of Memory.jpg|thumb|[[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'' (1931), [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[Manhattan]]]] -->\nThroughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in London]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Another English Surrealist group developed [[Birmingham Surrealists|in Birmingham]], meanwhile, and was distinguished by its opposition to the London surrealists and preferences for surrealism's French heartland. The two groups would reconcile later in the decade.\n\nDal\u00ed and Magritte created the most widely recognized images of the movement. Dal\u00ed joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.\n\nSurrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth; stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, in order to evoke empathy from the viewer.\n\n1931 was a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: Magritte's ''Voice of Space (La Voix des airs)''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/2593?tmpl=component&print=1 |title=Surrealism - Magritte - Voice of Space |publisher=Guggenheim Collection |date= |access-date=2009-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319041151/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/2593?tmpl=component&print=1 |archive-date=2015-03-19 |df= }}</ref> is an example of this process, where three large spheres representing bells hang above a landscape. Another Surrealist landscape from this same year is Yves Tanguy's ''[[:File:Premontory Palace.jpg|Promontory Palace (Palais promontoire)]]'', with its molten forms and liquid shapes. Liquid shapes became the trademark of Dal\u00ed, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they were melting.\n\nThe characteristics of this style\u2014a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological\u2014came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[modernism|modern]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be \"made whole with one's individuality\".\n\nBetween 1930 and 1933, the Surrealist Group in Paris issued the periodical ''[[Le Surr\u00e9alisme au service de la r\u00e9volution]]'' as the successor of ''La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste''.\n\nFrom 1936 through 1938 [[Wolfgang Paalen]], [[Gordon Onslow Ford]], and [[Roberto Matta]] joined the group. Paalen contributed [[Fumage]] and Onslow Ford [[Coulage]] as new pictorial automatic techniques.\n\nLong after personal, political and professional tensions fragmented the Surrealist group, Magritte and Dal\u00ed continued to define a visual program in the arts. This program reached beyond painting, to encompass photography as well, as can be seen from a Man Ray self-portrait, whose use of assemblage influenced [[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s collage boxes.\n[[File:L'Ange du Foyeur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Ernst]], ''L'Ange du Foyer ou le Triomphe du Surr\u00e9alisme'' (1937), private collection.]]\nDuring the 1930s [[Peggy Guggenheim]], an important American art collector, married Max Ernst and began promoting work by other Surrealists such as Yves Tanguy and the British artist [[John Tunnard]].\n\n'''Major exhibitions in the 1930s'''\n* 1936 - ''[[London International Surrealist Exhibition]]'' is organised in London by the art historian [[Herbert Read]], with an introduction by Andr\u00e9 Breton.\n* 1936 - [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York shows the exhibition ''[[Fantastic Art]], Dada and Surrealism''.\n* 1938 - A new ''[[Exposition Internationale du Surr\u00e9alisme]]'' was held at the Beaux-arts Gallery, Paris, with more than 60 artists from different countries, and showed around 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs and installations. The Surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act and called on Marcel Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray and others to do so. At the exhibition's entrance Salvador Dal\u00ed placed his [[Rainy Taxi]] (an old taxi rigged to produce a steady drizzle of water down the inside of the windows, and a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat and a blond mannequin crawling with live snails in the back) greeted the patrons who were in full evening dress. ''Surrealist Street'' filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various Surrealists. Paalen and Duchamp designed the main hall to seem like cave with 1,200 coal bags suspended from the ceiling over a coal brazier with a single light bulb which provided the only lighting, as well as the floor covered with humid leaves and mud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_8.html |title=Marcel Duchamp |publisher=Toutfait.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> The patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art. On the floor Wolfgang Paalen created a small lake with grasses and the aroma of roasting coffee filled the air. Much to the Surrealists' satisfaction the exhibition scandalized the viewers.<ref name=\"tomkins\"/>\n\n===World War II and the Post War period===\n[[File:Indefinite Divisibility.jpg|thumb|[[Yves Tanguy]] ''Indefinite Divisibility'' 1942, [[Albright Knox Art Gallery]], Buffalo, New York]]\nWorld War II created havoc not only for the general population of Europe but especially for the European artists and writers that opposed Fascism and Nazism. Many important artists fled to North America and relative safety in the United States. The art community in New York City in particular was already grappling with Surrealist ideas and several artists like [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Robert Motherwell]] converged closely with the surrealist artists themselves, albeit with some suspicion and reservations. Ideas concerning the unconscious and dream imagery were quickly embraced. By the Second World War, the taste of the American [[avant-garde]] in New York City swung decisively towards [[Abstract Expressionism]] with the support of key taste makers, including [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Leo Steinberg]] and [[Clement Greenberg]]. However, it should not be easily forgotten that Abstract Expressionism itself grew directly out of the meeting of American (particularly New York) artists with European Surrealists self-exiled during World War II. In particular, Gorky and Paalen influenced the development of this American art form, which, as Surrealism did, celebrated the instantaneous human act as the well-spring of creativity. The early work of many Abstract Expressionists reveals a tight bond between the more superficial aspects of both movements, and the emergence (at a later date) of aspects of [[Dadaist]]ic humor in such artists as [[Rauschenberg]] sheds an even starker light upon the connection. Up until the emergence of [[Pop Art]], Surrealism can be seen to have been the single most important influence on the sudden growth in American arts, and even in Pop, some of the humor manifested in Surrealism can be found, often turned to a cultural criticism.\n\nThe Second World War overshadowed, for a time, almost all intellectual and artistic production. In 1939 Wolfgang Paalen was the first to leave Paris for the New World as exile. After a long trip through the forests of British Columbia, he settled in Mexico and founded his influential art-magazine [[DYN (journal)|Dyn]]. In 1940 Yves Tanguy married American Surrealist painter [[Kay Sage]]. In 1941, Breton went to the United States, where he co-founded the short-lived magazine ''[[VVV (magazine)|VVV]]'' with Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, and the American artist [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]]. However, it was the American poet, [[Charles Henri Ford]], and his magazine ''[[View (magazine)|View]]'' which offered Breton a channel for promoting Surrealism in the United States. The ''View'' special issue on Duchamp was crucial for the public understanding of Surrealism in America. It stressed his connections to Surrealist methods, offered interpretations of his work by Breton, as well as Breton's view that Duchamp represented the bridge between early modern movements, such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] and [[Cubism]], to Surrealism. Wolfgang Paalen left the group in 1942 due to political/philosophical differences with Breton.\n\nThough the war proved disruptive for Surrealism, the works continued. Many Surrealist artists continued to explore their vocabularies, including Magritte. Many members of the Surrealist movement continued to correspond and meet. While Dal\u00ed may have been excommunicated by Breton, he neither abandoned his themes from the 1930s, including references to the \"persistence of time\" in a later painting, nor did he become a depictive pompier. His classic period did not represent so sharp a break with the past as some descriptions of his work might portray, and some, such as [[Andr\u00e9 Thirion]], argued that there were works of his after this period that continued to have some relevance for the movement.\n\nDuring the 1940s Surrealism's influence was also felt in England, America and the Netherlands where Gertrude Pape and her husband Theo van Baaren helped to popularize it in their publication The Clean Handkerchief.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Surrealist women : an international anthology|date=1998|publisher=University of Texas Press|others=Rosemont, Penelope.|isbn=978-0292770881|edition=1st|location=Austin|oclc=37782914|url=https://archive.org/details/surrealistwomeni00rose}}</ref> [[Mark Rothko]] took an interest in [[biomorphism|biomorphic]] figures, and in England [[Henry Moore]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] used or experimented with Surrealist techniques. However, [[Conroy Maddox]], one of the first British Surrealists whose work in this genre dated from 1935, remained within the movement, and organized an exhibition of current Surrealist work in 1978 in response to an earlier show which infuriated him because it did not properly represent Surrealism. Maddox's exhibition, titled ''Surrealism Unlimited'', was held in Paris and attracted international attention. He held his last one-man show in 2002, and died three years later.\nMagritte's work became more realistic in its depiction of actual objects, while maintaining the element of juxtaposition, such as in 1951's ''Personal Values (Les Valeurs Personnelles)''<ref>[http://www.sfmoma.org/MSoMA/newAWScreen.asp?awScreenNum=5139 SFmoma.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001014708/http://www.sfmoma.org/MSoMA/newAWScreen.asp?awScreenNum=5139 |date=October 1, 2008 }}</ref> and 1954's ''Empire of Light  (L\u2019Empire des lumi\u00e8res)''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/2594 |title=Artist - Magritte - Empire of Light - Large |publisher=Guggenheim Collection |date= January 1953|accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> Magritte continued to produce works which have entered artistic vocabulary, such as ''Castle in the Pyrenees (Le Ch\u00e2teau des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es)'',<ref>[https://artacademieparis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/magritte_Castle-in-the-Pyrenees.jpg Artacademieparis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510184620/https://artacademieparis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/magritte_Castle-in-the-Pyrenees.jpg |date=2018-05-10 }}</ref> which refers back to ''Voix'' from 1931, in its suspension over a landscape.\n\nOther figures from the Surrealist movement were expelled. Several of these artists, like [[Roberto Matta]] (by his own description) \"remained close to Surrealism\".<ref name=\"tomkins\"/>\n\nAfter the crushing of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], [[Endre Rozsda]] returned to Paris to continue creating his own word that had been transcended the surrealism. The preface to his first exhibition in the Furstenberg Gallery (1957) was written by Breton yet.<ref name=\"breton\">Breton, Andr\u00e9. ''Surrealism and Painting'', Icon, 1973</ref>\n\nMany new artists explicitly took up the Surrealist banner. [[Dorothea Tanning]] and [[Louise Bourgeois]] continued to work, for example, with Tanning's ''Rainy Day Canape'' from 1970. Duchamp continued to produce sculpture in secret including an installation with the realistic depiction of a woman viewable only through a peephole.\n\nBreton continued to write and espouse the importance of liberating the human mind, as with the publication ''[[The Tower of Light]]'' in 1952. Breton's return to France after the War, began a new phase of Surrealist activity in Paris, and his critiques of rationalism and dualism found a new audience. Breton insisted that Surrealism was an ongoing revolt against the reduction of humanity to market relationships, religious gestures and misery and to espouse the importance of liberating the human mind.\n\n'''Major exhibitions of the 1940s, '50s and '60s'''\n* 1942 - ''First Papers of Surrealism'' - New York - The Surrealists again called on Duchamp to design an exhibition.

While [[Guy Debord]] was critical of and distanced himself from Surrealism, others, such as [[Asger Jorn]], were explicitly using Surrealist techniques and methods. [[May 1968 events in France|The events of May 1968]] in France included a number of Surrealist ideas, and among the slogans the students spray-painted on the walls of the Sorbonne were familiar Surrealist ones. [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] would commemorate this in a painting titled ''May 1968.'' There were also groups who associated with both currents and were more attached to Surrealism, such as the [[Revolutionary Surrealist Group]].\n\nDuring the 1980s, behind the [[Iron Curtain]], Surrealism again entered into politics with an underground artistic opposition movement known as the [[Orange Alternative]]. The Orange Alternative was created in 1981 by [[Waldemar Fydrych]] (alias 'Major'), a graduate of history and art history at the University of [[Wroc\u0142aw]]. They used Surrealist symbolism and terminology in their large scale happenings organized in the major Polish cities during the [[Jaruzelski]] regime, and painted Surrealist graffiti on spots covering up anti-regime slogans. Major himself was the author of a \"Manifesto of Socialist Surrealism\". In this manifesto, he stated that the socialist (communist) system had become so Surrealistic that it could be seen as an expression of art itself.\n\nSurrealistic art also remains popular with museum patrons. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City held an exhibit, ''Two Private Eyes'', in 1999, and in 2001 [[Tate Modern]] held an exhibition of Surrealist art that attracted over 170,000 visitors. In 2002 the [[Metropolitan Museum|Met]] in New York City held a show, ''Desire Unbound'', and the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris a show called ''La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste''.\n\nSurrealists groups and literary publications have continued to be active up to the present day, with groups such as the [[Chicago Surrealist Group]], the Leeds Surrealist Group, and the Surrealist Group of Stockholm. [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]] of the Czech-Slovak Surrealists continues to make films and experiment with objects.\n\n==Impact of Surrealism==\nWhile Surrealism is typically associated with the arts, it has impacted many other fields. In this sense, Surrealism does not specifically refer only to self-identified \"Surrealists\", or those sanctioned by Breton, rather, it refers to a range of creative acts of revolt and efforts to liberate imagination.<ref>Vaneigem, Raoul (Dupuis Jules-Fran\u00e7ois), ''Histoire d\u00e9sinvolte du surr\u00e9alisme''.

One might say that Surrealist strands may be found in movements such as [[Free Jazz]] ([[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Cecil Taylor]] etc.) and even in the daily lives of people in confrontation with limiting social conditions. Thought of as the effort of humanity to liberate imagination as an act of insurrection against society, Surrealism finds precedents in the [[alchemy|alchemists]], possibly [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]],<ref name=\"thecityreview1\">[http://www.thecityreview.com/surreal.html ''Surrealism:Two Private Eyes''].

This period is known as the [[Postmodern]] era; though there's no widely agreed upon central definition of [[Postmodernism]], many themes and techniques commonly identified as Postmodern are nearly identical to Surrealism.\n\nMany writers from and associated with the [[Beat Generation]] were influenced greatly by Surrealists.

Spike Jones Jr., whose father's orchestral recordings had a deep and indelible effect on me as a child, said once in an interview, 'One of the things that people don't realize about Dad's kind of music is, when you replace a C-sharp with a gunshot, it has to be a C-sharp gunshot or it sounds awful.'\"<ref name=\"PynchonSurralism\">[[Thomas Pynchon]] (1984) ''[[Slow Learner]]'', p.20</ref>\n\nMany other postmodern fiction writers have been directly influenced by Surrealism.

The original Paris Surrealist Group was disbanded by member Jean Schuster in 1969, but another Parisian surrealist group was later formed. The current Surrealist Group of Paris has recently published the first issue of their new journal, ''Alcheringa''. The Group of Czech-Slovak Surrealists never disbanded, and continue to publish their journal ''Analogon'', which now spans 80 volumes.\n\n===Surrealism and the theatre===\nSurrealist theatre and Artaud's \"Theatre of Cruelty\" were inspirational to many within the group of playwrights that the critic Martin Esslin called the \"[[Theatre of the Absurd]]\" (in his 1963 book of the same name). Though not an organized movement, Esslin grouped these playwrights together based on some similarities of theme and technique; Esslin argues that these similarities may be traced to an influence from the Surrealists. [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] in particular was fond of Surrealism, claiming at one point that Breton was one of the most important thinkers in history.<ref>Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco.

Many critics feel these works belong to [[fantastic art]] rather than having a significant connection with Surrealism.<ref>\"...the tendency to interpret Bosch's imagery in terms of modern Surrealism or Freudian psychology is anachronistic. We forget too often that Bosch never read Freud and that modern psychoanalysis would have been incomprehensible to the medieval mind... Modern psychology may explain the appeal Bosch's pictures have for us, but it cannot explain the meaning they had for Bosch and his contemporaries. Bosch did not intend to evoke the subconscious of the viewer, but to teach him certain moral and spiritual truths, and thus his images generally had a precise and premeditated significance.\" {{Cite book|title=Hieronymus Bosch, c. 1450-1516 : between heaven and hell|last=Bosing, Walter.|date=2000|publisher=Taschen|isbn=3822858560|location=London|oclc=45329900}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Avant-garde]]\n*[[Bizarre object|Bizarre Object]]\n*[[Dada]]\n* {{annotated link|Neo-Fauvism}}\n* {{annotated link|Organic Surrealism}}\n* {{annotated link|Outsider art}}\n* {{annotated link|Psychedelic art}}\n* {{annotated link|Sal\u00f3n de Mayo}} (Cuba)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''[[Andr\u00e9 Breton]]'''\n* ''Manifestoes of Surrealism'' containing the first, second and introduction to a possible third manifesto, the novel ''The Soluble Fish'', and political aspects of the Surrealist movement. {{ISBN|0-472-17900-4}} .\n* ''What is Surrealism?: Selected Writings of Andr\u00e9 Breton''. {{ISBN|0-87348-822-9}} .\n* ''Conversations: The Autobiography of Surrealism'' (Gallimard 1952) (Paragon House English rev. ed. 1993). {{ISBN|1-56924-970-9}}.\n* ''The Abridged Dictionary of Surrealism'', reprinted in:\n** Bonnet, Marguerite, ed.
