In this work, he describes many of his experiments with his model Earth called the [[terrella]]. From these experiments, he concluded that the [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth]] was itself [[magnetic]] and that this was the reason [[compass]]es point north (previously, some believed that it was the pole star ([[Polaris]]) or a large magnetic island on the north pole that attracted the compass).  He was the first to argue, correctly, that the centre of the Earth was iron, and he considered an important and related property of magnets was that they can be cut, each forming a new magnet with north and south poles.\n\nIn [[De Magnete#Book 6, Chapter III: Of the Daily Magnetic Rotation of the Globes|Book 6, Chapter 3]], he argues in support of diurnal rotation, though he does not talk about heliocentrism, stating that it is an absurdity to think that the immense  [[celestial spheres]] (doubting even that they exist) rotate daily, as opposed to the diurnal rotation of the much smaller Earth. He also posits that the \"fixed\" stars are at remote variable distances rather than fixed to an imaginary sphere. He states that situated \"in thinnest aether, or in the most subtle fifth essence, or in vacuity&nbsp;\u2013 how shall the stars keep their places in the mighty swirl of these enormous spheres composed of a substance of which no one knows aught?\"\n\nThe English word \"electricity\" was first used in 1646 by [[Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]], derived from Gilbert's 1600 [[New Latin]] ''electricus'', meaning \"like [[amber]]\".  The term had been in use since the 13th century, but Gilbert was the first to use it to mean \"like amber in its attractive properties\".  He recognized that friction with these objects removed a so-called \"effluvium\", which would cause the attraction effect in returning to the object, though he did not realize that this substance ([[electric charge]]) was universal to all materials.<ref name=\"Heathcote\">{{cite journal |last=Heathcote |first=Niels H. de V. |doi=10.1080/00033796700203316 |volume=23 |issue=4 |page=261 |title=The early meaning of ''electricity'': Some ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' \u2013 I |journal=[[Annals of Science]] |date=1967}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The electric effluvia differ much from air, and as air is the earth's effluvium, so electric bodies have their own distinctive effluvia; and each peculiar effluvium has its own individual power of leading to union, its own movement to its origin, to its fount, and to the body emitting the effluvium.|{{harvnb|Gilbert|1893}}}}\n\nIn his book, he also studied [[static electricity]] using [[amber]]; amber is called ''elektron'' in Greek, so Gilbert decided to call its effect the ''electric force''.  He invented the first electrical [[measuring instrument]], the [[electroscope]], in the form of a pivoted needle he called the ''[[versorium]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Gilbert|1893|p=79}}</ref>\n\nLike others of his day, he believed that crystal ([[quartz]]) was an especially hard form of water, formed from compressed ice:\n\n{{quote|Lucid gems are made of water; just as Crystal, which has been concreted from clear water, not always by a very great cold, as some used to judge, and by very hard frost, but sometimes by a less severe one, the nature of the soil fashioning it, the humour or juices being shut up in definite cavities, in the way in which spars are produced in mines.|''[[De Magnete]]'', English translation by [[Silvanus Phillips Thompson]], 1900}}\n\nGilbert argued that electricity and magnetism were not the same thing.  For evidence, he (incorrectly) pointed out that, while electrical attraction disappeared with heat, magnetic attraction did not (although it is proven that magnetism does in fact become damaged and weakened with heat). [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] showed that both effects were aspects of a single force: electromagnetism. Maxwell surmised this in his ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' after much analysis.\n\nGilbert's [[magnetism]] was the invisible force that many other natural philosophers seized upon, incorrectly, as governing the motions that they observed.  While not attributing magnetism to attraction among the stars, Gilbert pointed out the motion of the skies was due to Earth's rotation, and not the rotation of the spheres, 20 years before [[Galileo]] (but 57 years after [[Copernicus]] who stated it openly in his work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' published in 1543 ) (see external reference below). Gilbert made the first attempt to map the surface markings on the Moon in the 1590s. His chart, made without the use of a telescope, showed outlines of dark and light patches on the Moon's face. Contrary to most of his contemporaries, Gilbert believed that the light spots on the Moon were water, and the dark spots land.<ref>Bochenski, Leslie (April 1996) [http://uias.astro.illinois.edu/s-m/sm-apr-96.html \"A Short History of Lunar Cartography\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803073221/http://uias.astro.illinois.edu/s-m/sm-apr-96.html |date=3 August 2010 }}.

D. Appleton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GNUyAQAAMAAJ& Vol. 2], p. 217</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nGilbert... repeatedly asserts the paramount value of experiments. He himself, no doubt, acted up to his own precepts; for his work contains all the fundamental facts of the science [of magnetism], so fully examined, indeed, that even at this day we have little to add to them.\n</blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Henry Hallam]] wrote of Gilbert in his ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries'' (1848):<ref>Hallam, Henry (1854) ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the 15th, 16th, and 17th Centuries''.

Little, Brown, and Company. pp. 232\u20133</ref>\n<blockquote>\nThe year 1600 was the first in which England produced a remarkable work in physical science; but this was one sufficient to raise a lasting reputation to its author. Gilbert, a physician, in his Latin treatise on the magnet, not only collected all the knowledge which others had possessed on that subject, but became at once the father of experimental philosophy in this island, and by a singular felicity and acuteness of genius, the founder of theories which have been revived after the lapse of ages, and are almost universally received into the creed of the science. The magnetism of the earth itself, his own original hypothesis, ''nova illa nostra et inaudita de tellure sententia'' [our new and unprecedented view of the planet]... was by no means one of those vague conjectures that are sometimes unduly applauded... He relied on the analogy of terrestrial phenomena to those exhibited by what he calls a ''[[terrella]]'', or artificial spherical magnet.  ...Gilbert was also one of our earliest Copernicans, at least as to the rotation of the earth; and with his usual sagacity inferred, before the invention of the telescope, that there are a multitude of fixed stars beyond the reach of our vision.\n</blockquote>\n\nWalter William Bryant of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, wrote in his book [[wikiquote:Kepler|''Kepler'']] (1920):\n<blockquote>\nWhen Gilbert of Colchester, in his \u201cNew Philosophy,\u201d founded on his researches in magnetism, was dealing with tides, he did not suggest that the moon attracted the water, but that \u201csubterranean spirits and humors, rising in sympathy with the moon, cause the sea also to rise and flow to the shores and up rivers\u201d. It appears that an idea, presented in some such way as this, was more readily received than a plain statement. This so-called philosophical method was, in fact, very generally applied, and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], who shared Galileo\u2019s admiration for Gilbert\u2019s work, adopted it in his own attempt to extend the idea of magnetic attraction to the planets.<ref>Bryant, Walter William (1920) {{ws | [[s: Kepler|''Kepler'']]}}.

In this work, he describes many of his experiments with his model Earth called the [[terrella]]. From these experiments, he concluded that the [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth]] was itself [[magnetic]] and that this was the reason [[compass]]es point north (previously, some believed that it was the pole star ([[Polaris]]) or a large magnetic island on the north pole that attracted the compass).  He was the first to argue, correctly, that the centre of the Earth was iron, and he considered an important and related property of magnets was that they can be cut, each forming a new magnet with north and south poles.\n\nIn [[De Magnete#Book 6, Chapter III: Of the Daily Magnetic Rotation of the Globes|Book 6, Chapter 3]], he argues in support of diurnal rotation, though he does not talk about heliocentrism, stating that it is an absurdity to think that the immense  [[celestial spheres]] (doubting even that they exist) rotate daily, as opposed to the diurnal rotation of the much smaller Earth. He also posits that the \"fixed\" stars are at remote variable distances rather than fixed to an imaginary sphere. He states that situated \"in thinnest aether, or in the most subtle fifth essence, or in vacuity&nbsp;\u2013 how shall the stars keep their places in the mighty swirl of these enormous spheres composed of a substance of which no one knows aught?\"\n\nThe English word \"electricity\" was first used in 1646 by [[Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]], derived from Gilbert's 1600 [[New Latin]] ''electricus'', meaning \"like [[amber]]\".  The term had been in use since the 13th century, but Gilbert was the first to use it to mean \"like amber in its attractive properties\".  He recognized that friction with these objects removed a so-called \"effluvium\", which would cause the attraction effect in returning to the object, though he did not realize that this substance ([[electric charge]]) was universal to all materials.<ref name=\"Heathcote\">{{cite journal |last=Heathcote |first=Niels H. de V. |doi=10.1080/00033796700203316 |volume=23 |issue=4 |page=261 |title=The early meaning of ''electricity'': Some ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' \u2013 I |journal=[[Annals of Science]] |date=1967}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The electric effluvia differ much from air, and as air is the earth's effluvium, so electric bodies have their own distinctive effluvia; and each peculiar effluvium has its own individual power of leading to union, its own movement to its origin, to its fount, and to the body emitting the effluvium.|{{harvnb|Gilbert|1893}}}}\n\nIn his book, he also studied [[static electricity]] using [[amber]]; amber is called ''elektron'' in Greek, so Gilbert decided to call its effect the ''electric force''.  He invented the first electrical [[measuring instrument]], the [[electroscope]], in the form of a pivoted needle he called the ''[[versorium]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Gilbert|1893|p=79}}</ref>\n\nLike others of his day, he believed that crystal ([[quartz]]) was an especially hard form of water, formed from compressed ice:\n\n{{quote|Lucid gems are made of water; just as Crystal, which has been concreted from clear water, not always by a very great cold, as some used to judge, and by very hard frost, but sometimes by a less severe one, the nature of the soil fashioning it, the humour or juices being shut up in definite cavities, in the way in which spars are produced in mines.|''[[De Magnete]]'', English translation by [[Silvanus Phillips Thompson]], 1900}}\n\nGilbert argued that electricity and magnetism were not the same thing.  For evidence, he (incorrectly) pointed out that, while electrical attraction disappeared with heat, magnetic attraction did not (although it is proven that magnetism does in fact become damaged and weakened with heat). [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] showed that both effects were aspects of a single force: electromagnetism. Maxwell surmised this in his ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' after much analysis.\n\nGilbert's [[magnetism]] was the invisible force that many other natural philosophers seized upon, incorrectly, as governing the motions that they observed.  While not attributing magnetism to attraction among the stars, Gilbert pointed out the motion of the skies was due to Earth's rotation, and not the rotation of the spheres, 20 years before [[Galileo]] (but 57 years after [[Copernicus]] who stated it openly in his work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' published in 1543 ) (see external reference below). Gilbert made the first attempt to map the surface markings on the Moon in the 1590s. His chart, made without the use of a telescope, showed outlines of dark and light patches on the Moon's face. Contrary to most of his contemporaries, Gilbert believed that the light spots on the Moon were water, and the dark spots land.<ref>Bochenski, Leslie (April 1996) [http://uias.astro.illinois.edu/s-m/sm-apr-96.html \"A Short History of Lunar Cartography\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803073221/http://uias.astro.illinois.edu/s-m/sm-apr-96.html |date=3 August 2010 }}.

D. Appleton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GNUyAQAAMAAJ& Vol. 2], p. 217</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nGilbert... repeatedly asserts the paramount value of experiments. He himself, no doubt, acted up to his own precepts; for his work contains all the fundamental facts of the science [of magnetism], so fully examined, indeed, that even at this day we have little to add to them.\n</blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Henry Hallam]] wrote of Gilbert in his ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries'' (1848):<ref>Hallam, Henry (1854) ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the 15th, 16th, and 17th Centuries''.

Little, Brown, and Company. pp. 232\u20133</ref>\n<blockquote>\nThe year 1600 was the first in which England produced a remarkable work in physical science; but this was one sufficient to raise a lasting reputation to its author. Gilbert, a physician, in his Latin treatise on the magnet, not only collected all the knowledge which others had possessed on that subject, but became at once the father of experimental philosophy in this island, and by a singular felicity and acuteness of genius, the founder of theories which have been revived after the lapse of ages, and are almost universally received into the creed of the science. The magnetism of the earth itself, his own original hypothesis, ''nova illa nostra et inaudita de tellure sententia'' [our new and unprecedented view of the planet]... was by no means one of those vague conjectures that are sometimes unduly applauded... He relied on the analogy of terrestrial phenomena to those exhibited by what he calls a ''[[terrella]]'', or artificial spherical magnet.  ...Gilbert was also one of our earliest Copernicans, at least as to the rotation of the earth; and with his usual sagacity inferred, before the invention of the telescope, that there are a multitude of fixed stars beyond the reach of our vision.\n</blockquote>\n\nWalter William Bryant of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, wrote in his book [[wikiquote:Kepler|''Kepler'']] (1920):\n<blockquote>\nWhen Gilbert of Colchester, in his \u201cNew Philosophy,\u201d founded on his researches in magnetism, was dealing with tides, he did not suggest that the moon attracted the water, but that \u201csubterranean spirits and humors, rising in sympathy with the moon, cause the sea also to rise and flow to the shores and up rivers\u201d. It appears that an idea, presented in some such way as this, was more readily received than a plain statement. This so-called philosophical method was, in fact, very generally applied, and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], who shared Galileo\u2019s admiration for Gilbert\u2019s work, adopted it in his own attempt to extend the idea of magnetic attraction to the planets.<ref>Bryant, Walter William (1920) {{ws | [[s: Kepler|''Kepler'']]}}.

Titled as \"'''What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)'''\" for the album version, the song served as its second single on January 17, 2012 through [[RCA Records]]. Written by [[J\u00f6rgen Elofsson]], [[Ali Tamposi]], and [[David Gamson]], with additional writing and production by [[Greg Kurstin]], \"Stronger\" is an uptempo song which draws from the genres of [[dance-pop]] and [[electropop]]. Its lyrical content mainly explores themes of empowerment and recovery following a heartbreak, with the chorus inspired by a [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] quotation: \"That which does not kill us makes us stronger.\"<ref>Nietzsche, F. W. (1888), ''[[Twilight of the Idols]],'' \u00a7Maxims & Arrows.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, \"Stronger\" became her third song to top the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart for three non-consecutive weeks, surpassing \"[[A Moment Like This]]\" (2002) and \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\" (2009) as her longest-running number one single on the chart. It also topped fifteen other ''Billboard'' charts, including [[Adult Pop Songs]], [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]], [[Hot Dance Club Songs]], and [[Pop Songs]] charts, more than any other song Clarkson has ever released. Internationally, \"Stronger\" topped the national charts of Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia and attained a top-ten position in over fifteen countries around the world, eventually selling over five million copies worldwide, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles of all time]]. Its success helped its parent album to sustain commercial longevity for over a year. \"Stronger\" merited consideration for several industry awards\u2014including three [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award nominations]], and a [[World Music Award|World Music Award nomination]].\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was filmed by [[Shane Drake]], which incorporates the theme of a global flash mob dance, featuring submitted videos of people dancing to the song. The music video garnered positive reception from critics who felt that its overall impact was exuberant. It earned Clarkson a nomination for a [[MuchMusic Video Award]]. With its continued success, she performed \"Stronger\" on several live award shows and television appearances around the world, debuting it during the [[The X Factor (U.S. season 1)|first season]] of ''[[The X Factor (U.S. TV series)|The X Factor]]''  (US) and performing it on the [[Saturday Night Live (season 37)|37th season]] of ''[[Saturday Night Live (season 37)|Saturday Night Live]]'', the [[2012 MuchMusic Video Awards]], and the [[American Music Awards of 2012|2012 American Music Awards]]. Clarkson also included the song in the [[set list]] of her [[Stronger Tour]] and on the encore set of her 2012 Summer Tour with [[The Fray]].\n\n== Writing and production ==\nOriginally titled as \"What Doesn't Kill You\", \"Stronger\" was written by [[J\u00f6rgen Elofsson]], Ali Tamposi, [[David Gamson]], and [[Greg Kurstin]] in September 2010.<ref name=\"American Songwriter\" /> In an interview with ''[[American Songwriter]]'', Tamposi revealed that the song was inspired by the [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] adage (\"That which does not kill us makes us stronger\") that her mother told her as advice.<ref name=\"American Songwriter\" /> Although Tamposi found the phrase saccharine, she submitted it as an idea to Elofsson and Gamson during their writing sessions. Elofsson originally intended \"Stronger\" for [[Leona Lewis]], who turned it down in the process.<ref name=\"Aftonbladet\" /> Tamposi's manager, Tom Maffei, then had one of his producers, Matty Trump, produce a demo track, later  pitched to RCA [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] executive Jeff Aldrich, who gave the song to Clarkson. Tamposi revealed that Clarkson had also altered a lyric from the track.<ref name=\"American Songwriter\" /> Aldrich had then commissioned [[Greg Kurstin]], whom Clarkson wanted to collaborate with, to produce and add additional writing to the final version. Kurstin recalled, \"I rethought the music part of it, I guess. It had a different tempo, beat, chords, and I kinda just came up with that guitar riff that goes into the verse, and that was the first thing that I kinda contributed just changed the feel of the song.\"<ref name=\"Popdust\" /> The song's uplifting theme of empowerment led Clarkson to name her fifth studio album ''Stronger''.<ref name=\"MTV News 2\" /> saying that it is one of her favorite songs in the album, she said, \"Everybody loves the message 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' It's a perfect representation of my life.\"<ref name=\"Digital Spy 1\" />\n\n== Composition ==\n{{Listen\n|filename = Kelly_Clarkson_-_What_Doesn't_Kill_You_(Stronger).ogg\n|title = \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\"\n|description = A 22-second sample of \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" by Kelly Clarkson.

Clarkson's vocals span two octaves, from G<sub>3</sub> to G<sub>5</sub>.<ref name=\"Hal Leonard\" /> The song begins with a \"[[guitar|rumbling guitar]]\" and a \"shimmering synth\" riff as Clarkson sings the opening line \"You know the bed feels warmer / Sleeping here alone.\"<ref name=\"Idolator 1\" /> Jason Lipshutz of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' noted that the [[guitar]] riff in the verses is reminiscent of Clarkson's \"[[Since U Been Gone]]\" which narrates an anthem of personal reinvention, and dancing.<ref name=\"Billboard 1\" /> The bridges contain pulsating beats with synth and [[electric guitar]] that display some elements of electronic sound.<ref name=\"Billboard 2\" /> During chorus, the song explodes into an upbeat [[dance-pop]] number, complete with [[guitars]] and [[electronic drums]] as Clarkson sings \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger / Stand a little taller / Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone.\"<ref name=\"Idolator 1\" /> Jonathan Keefe of ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'' felt nobody else could sell the song's \"ginormous chorus\" better than Clarkson.<ref name=\"Slant\" /> Lyrically, \"Stronger\" explores the theme of moving on from an inimical relationship.<ref name=\"Digital Spy 4\" /> In an interview, Clarkson remarked that the song doesn't refer to a specific person, stating \"I didn't have a bad breakup or anything, I just think life is about relationships so I always write all about these different ones going on in my life. And I don't have a filter, so it's pretty verbatim.\"<ref name=\"MTV News 2\" /> Jason Scott of [[Blogcritics]] felt that out of all tracks in ''Stronger,'' Clarkson's vocals are best and trendiest in \"What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)\".<ref name=\"Blogcritics\" />\n\nIn an interview with [[MTV News]] prior to the song's release, Clarkson compared \"Stronger\" to \"[[Since U Been Gone]]\" (2004). She commented, \"We've already rehearsed it, and it's so much fun. It's like this big dance anthem. That'll be the one [that's] kinda like \"Since U Been Gone\", [with] people jumping up and down to [it], and it's just kind of really inspiring, so I can't wait to perform that one.\"<ref name=\"MTV News 1\" />\n\n== Release and reception ==\nAfter returning from a vacation on [[Tahiti]], Clarkson found out over 50 of her newly recorded demo material were [[internet leak|leaked]] online,<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly 1\" /> including \"Stronger\".<ref name=\"Digital Spy 2\" /> She commented that the leak felt worse than being physically robbed.<ref name=\"Digital Spy 3\" /> In an attempt to counter-attack the leakage, RCA finally debuted the song online on October 5, 2011, three weeks ahead of the album's release.<ref name=\"Digital Spy 4\" /> An acoustic version of the song appears in Clarkson's second extended play, ''[[iTunes Session (Kelly Clarkson EP)|iTunes Session]]''.<ref name=\"USA Today 1\" /> The song was featured in a [[Toyota Camry]] commercial featuring Clarkson and other celebrities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2012/02/08/kelly-clarkson-stronger-number-one/|title=Kelly Clarkson's 'Stronger' hits No. 1 following her Super Bowl anthem, ubiquitous Camry ad|publisher=}}</ref> \"Stronger\" was officially released as the album's second single to mainstream radio on January 17, 2012.<ref name=\"Allaccess\" /> A dance [[remix]]es of the song were made available on February 3, 2012.<ref name=\"Release \u2013 Remixes\" /> On February 17, 2012, it was released as a [[CD single]].<ref name=\"Release \u2013 CD Single 1\" />\n\n=== Critical response ===\nJenna Hally Rubenstein of ''[[MTV|MTV Buzzworthy]]'' compared it to \"Since U Been Gone,\" which has \"a super radio-friendly hook.\"<ref name=\"MTV Buzzworthy 1\" /> Elizabeth Lancaster of MTV Newsroom listed it as one of five key tracks in ''Stronger,'' writing \"Upbeat yet soulful, the chorus will drag you up and onto the floor to dance the heartache away alongside her.\"<ref name=\"MTV News 3\" /> Grady Smith of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' thought that the song's \"belty pop/rock wheelhouse\" should please fans of the sound. He later added that \"Clarkson might have been better off releasing \"What Doesn\u2019t Kill You\" as the first track from ''Stronger.''\"<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly 2\" /> Another positive reception came from Glenn Gamboa of ''[[Newsday]]'', who praised Clarkson for \"infusing her tales of empowerment after a breakup with her unique combo of vulnerability and sass.\"<ref name=\"Newsday\" /> Jonathan Keefe of ''Slant'' thought that the song is \"tailor-made for radio play\" and that \"the chilly electro-pop that Greg Kurstin brings to the verses, suggests a [[Top-40|top forty]] version of [[Robyn]]'s \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" (2010).<ref name=\"Slant\" /> On March 5, 2013, ''Billboard'' ranked the song at number two in its list of Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time.<ref name=\"Billboard 22\"/> Additionally, it also appeared at number two of Clarkson's Top 15 Biggest ''Billboard'' Hot 100 hits through the week ending April 29, 2017.<ref name=\"Billboard 24\"/>\n\nChris Willman of [[Reuters]] criticized the lyrics, commenting that \"Never mind how tired that tune's titular phrase is. For a laugh, look up the [[YouTube]] video in which some wag mashed together a medley of 30 different songs that already borrowed \"That which does not kill me makes me stronger\" as a lyrical hook.\"<ref name=\"Reuters\" /> Kevin Ritchie from [[Now (newspaper)|Now Magazine]] emphasized that the lyrics are \"about as clich\u00e9d as a mission statement can get, but it also makes for a solid pop song.\"<ref name=\"Now magazine\" /> Robert Copsey of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' gave the song four stars out of five, writing \"The message behind her song may already be a well-worn, almost cliched lesson, but as she continues to prove, there's little shame in coming out with the expected.\"<ref name=\"Digital Spy 5\" />\n\n=== Commercial performance ===\nIn the United States, \"Stronger\" topped sixteen ''Billboard'' charts, marking career highs for Clarkson.<ref name=\"Hollywood Reporter 1\" /> Boosted by digital sales following the release of ''Stronger'', the song debuted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart as an album cut at number 64 on the week ending October 30, 2011.<ref name=\"Yahoo 1\" /> It dropped out following week before returning at number 99 on week ending November 20, 2011.<ref name=\"Yahoo 2\" /> Following its release as a single, \"Stronger\" re-entered ''Billboard'' Hot 100 at number 58 after Clarkson performed it on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on the week ending January 21, 2012.<ref name=\"Billboard 3\" /> On the week ending January 28, 2012, the song climbed to number 21,<ref name=\"Yahoo 3\" /> as well as debuting at number 38 on [[Adult Top 40|Adult Pop Songs]].<ref name=\"Billboard 4\" /> The following week, it became her tenth top ten song on the Hot 100 chart as it advanced to number 8 due to the strength of a number 11 to number 3 jump on [[Hot Digital Songs]] and vault on [[Hot 100 Airplay (Radio Songs)|Hot 100 Airplay]] from number 71 to number 44.<ref name=\"Billboard 5\" /> With \"[[Mr. Know It All]]\" (2011) having peaked at number 10 on the Hot 100, \"Stronger\"'s ascent to number 8 marked the first time Clarkson has had a string of consecutive top ten hits since 2004\u20132005, when she had four consecutive top-ten hits from her second studio album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]'' (2004).<ref name=\"Billboard 5\" /><ref name=\"Yahoo 4\" /> That same week, it debuted at number 30 on [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Pop Songs]] and at number 40 on [[Hot Dance Club Songs]].<ref name=\"Billboard 5\" /> On the week ending February 11, \"Stronger\" bounded from number 8 to number 2 on the Hot 100 as it topped the Hot Digital Songs chart fueled by 225,000 downloads, becoming her second song to top the Hot Digital Songs after \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\" (2009).<ref name=\"Billboard 6\" /> The following week, it ascended to the top of the Hot 100, becoming her third number 1 single in the country after \"A Moment Like This\" and \"My Life Would Suck Without You\".<ref name=\"Billboard 7\" /> It held the top spot for another week, before descending to number 4 on the week ending March 3, 2012.<ref name=\"Billboard 8\" /> That same week, it became her first song to top the Hot Dance Club Songs,<ref name=\"Billboard 9\" /> making Clarkson only first artist ever to have topped the Hot 100 and each of the Hot Dance Club Songs, [[Hot Country Songs]], [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]], and Adult Pop Songs charts.<ref name=\"Billboard 8\" /> The week after, it returned to number 1 on the Hot 100 for the third time, thus becoming her longest-reigning number 1 single in the United States.<ref name=\"Billboard 10\" /><ref name=\"Billboard 11\" /> On the week ending March 24, 2012, \"Stronger\" became Clarkson's fourth song to top the Pop Songs chart and her first in six years.<ref name=\"Billboard 12\" /> It also became her first song to top the Hot 100 Airplay on the week ending April 7, 2012,<ref name=\"Billboard 13\" /> her fourth song to top the Adult Pop Songs on the week ending March 10, 2012,<ref name=\"Billboard 14\" /> and her second song to top the Adult Contemporary chart on the week ending June 16, 2012.<ref name=\"Billboard 15\" /> In its 2012 Year-End issue, ''Billboard'' ranked \"Stronger\" number 7 on the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2012|Year-End Hot 100]],<ref name=\"Year End 2012 - US 1\" /> marking the first time Clarkson has had a Year-End top ten single on the chart in seven years since \"Since U Been Gone\" and \"[[Behind These Hazel Eyes]]\" (2005).

Titled as \"'''What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)'''\" for the album version, the song served as its second single on January 17, 2012 through [[RCA Records]]. Written by [[J\u00f6rgen Elofsson]], [[Ali Tamposi]], and [[David Gamson]], with additional writing and production by [[Greg Kurstin]], \"Stronger\" is an uptempo song which draws from the genres of [[dance-pop]] and [[electropop]].

Kurstin recalled, \"I rethought the music part of it, I guess. It had a different tempo, beat, chords, and I kinda just came up with that guitar riff that goes into the verse, and that was the first thing that I kinda contributed just changed the feel of the song.\"<ref name=\"Popdust\" /> The song's uplifting theme of empowerment led Clarkson to name her fifth studio album ''Stronger''.<ref name=\"MTV News 2\" /> saying that it is one of her favorite songs in the album, she said, \"Everybody loves the message 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'

He captained [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] for two Tests during the 1965&ndash;66 [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series while regular captain [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] was absent due to illness and injury. Booth was a graceful right-handed middle order batsman at No. 4 or 5, and occasionally bowled right arm [[pace bowling|medium pace]] or [[off spin]]. He had an inclination to use his feet to charge [[spin bowling|spin bowlers]]. Booth was known for his [[sportsmanship]] on the field and often invoked [[Sydney Anglicans|Christianity]] while discussing ethics and sport.\n\nBorn near the [[New South Wales]] country town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], Booth moved to Sydney in 1952 and played in the [[Sydney Grade Cricket|grade cricket]] competition while training to become a teacher. He made his first-class debut for the [[New South Wales cricket team]] and came to prominence in dramatic circumstances in his second match, against the touring [[England cricket team|Englishmen]] in 1954&ndash;55. Due to late withdrawals, Booth was selected at late notice and had to be called from work on the morning of the match. After arriving after the start of the match, he scored 74 following a batting collapse. Booth struggled to make an impression early in his career and missed a season to train and with the Australian [[field hockey]] team for the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]]. Upon returning to first-class cricket in 1957&ndash;58, he held down a regular position in the state team while the Test players were touring overseas. Booth gradually progressed and gained selection on the 1959&ndash;60 Australian Second XI tour to [[New Zealand]].\n\nBooth was selected for the Australian team that toured England in 1961 and played in the final two Tests. Upon his return to Australia, Booth made two [[century (cricket)|centuries]] in the 1962&ndash;63 home Test series against England, establishing himself in the Test team. He made two further centuries the following summer against [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] and was named the Australian player of the year. Following the retirement of [[Richie Benaud]], Booth was appointed vice-captain under Simpson as Australia embarked on a successful 1964 tour of England, which saw the retention of the Ashes. Booth played his final Test series in 1965&ndash;66 against England, captaining Australia in the First and Third Tests because Simpson was sidelined with a broken wrist and [[chickenpox]] respectively. The First Test was drawn but Australia fell to its first innings defeat in almost ten years in the Third Test. As he was also in a form slump, Booth was dropped as the Australian selectors made mass changes, ending his career. In retirement, Booth returned to his teaching duties and served as an Anglican lay-preacher. He was inducted into the [[Cricket NSW]] Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\n== Early years ==\nThe son of \"Snowy\" Booth, a market gardener and talented country cricketer,<ref>Booth and White, p. 9.</ref> Booth was born in [[Perthville, New South Wales|Perthville]], located {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} outside the New South Wales regional town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]].<ref name=pollard/> His father hung pictures of [[Don Bradman]] and [[Stan McCabe]] on the wall and told him that \"these are the two greatest living cricketers\".<ref name=h257>Haigh, p. 257.</ref> Booth represented [[Bathurst High School (Bathurst, New South Wales)|Bathurst High School]] at the age of 13 and played first grade cricket in Bathurst at 15. He was selected for a New South Wales youth country side at the age of just 14. In 1950, Booth represented New South Wales Country against a combined Sydney team, and moved to [[St. George Cricket Club|St. George]] to play on a weekly basis two years later.<ref name=\"pollard\"/> He made the first grade team at the age of 19 and began a four-year course at [[Sydney Teachers College]].<ref name=\"p246\">Perry (2000), p. 246.</ref><ref name=\"r275\"/> Booth also played hockey in [[Perthville]] and began playing for St. George upon his arrival in Sydney.<ref>Booth and White, p. 35.</ref>\n\nBooth made his [[First-class cricket|first-class]] debut for [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] in the 1954&ndash;55 [[Sheffield Shield]].

[[Arthur Morris]] and [[Bill Watson (cricketer)|Bill Watson]] had to withdraw at late notice and Booth was asked to play, having already started his day's work as a teacher at [[Hurlstone Agricultural High School|Hurlstone Agricultural College]]. He caught a train and arrived at the ground more than half an hour after the start of play, by which time New South Wales had collapsed to 3/12. New South Wales fell further to 5/26 before Booth came in with a borrowed cap and [[Cricket bat|bat]] to join [[Peter Philpott]].

He was known for not hitting the ball hard but for having an easy and relaxed style.<ref name=\"p246\"/> In [[Field hockey|hockey]], a player is not allowed to lift his stick above the shoulders; this background strengthened Booth's forearms and wrists and enabled him to impart momentum on the ball without a large swing of the blade.<ref name=\"r274\"/> Booth was particularly known for his [[late cut]] and his [[cover drive]], which he played in a manner not dissimilar to [[Mark Waugh]].<ref name=\"p246\"/> He was known for his quick footwork against [[spin bowling]] and was rarely stumped, and he had the ability to change his batting tempo.<ref name=\"p246\"/> Booth quickly got into position and typically moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps.<ref name=\"r274\"/> A lean player, Booth stood 181&nbsp;cm, weighed 66&nbsp;kg and refrained from smoking, gambling and drinking.<ref name=h257/><ref name=az/> He was known for his efficient outfielding, and on the second day of the Second Test against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in [[Trinidad]] in 1964&ndash;65, he [[run out|ran out]] [[Gary Sobers]] and [[Basil Butcher]] with strong throws from the outfield. Booth started as a part-time [[leg spin]]ner before converting to [[off spin]].<ref name=\"az\"/>\n\nBooth had a reputation for walking when he knew that he was out, without waiting for the [[Umpire (cricket)|umpire's]] decision, and he was regarded as a player and leader of the highest principles.<ref name=\"r277\"/><ref name=\"p245\"/> He was known for his record of instilling high standards of conduct into his players and prevented them from showing dissent towards unfavourable umpiring decisions.<ref name=\"r277\">Robinson, p. 277.</ref> Robinson said that \"if a prize were offered for fairplaymanship among Australia's post-war cricketers Brian Booth ought to win it hands down\".<ref name=\"r279\">Robinson, p. 279.</ref> Lawry regarded Booth as one of the most gentlemanly cricketers that he knew.<ref>Coleman, p. 592.</ref>\n\nA committed [[Christianity|Christian]], Booth is an [[Anglican]] lay-preacher,<ref name=\"p245\"/> and often invokes religious and ethical arguments while talking about issues such as [[sportsmanship]]. Booth became intensely religious in the 1950s after befriending Pastor Roy Gray, a colleague in district cricket and a classmate at Sydney Teachers College.<ref name=h257/> Gray challenged his friend's faith, and Booth reflected that \"Until that point, sport had really been my God\".<ref name=h257/> During Booth's career, the media made much of his religious convictions. After scoring his maiden Test century, Booth was asked whether he felt that God was with him.<ref name=h258>Haigh, p. 258.</ref> He replied in the affirmative, and the next day, a newspaper printed the headline \"England can't win. God is on Brian Booth's side.\"<ref name=h258/>\n\nBooth co-authored ''Cricket and Christianity'' with [[Paul White (missionary)|Paul White]] and wrote ''Hockey Fundamentals'' and ''Booth to Bat''. In 1998 he wrote ''Sport and sportsmanship: a Christian perspective towards 2000'' for the Australian Christian Forum on Education. He believed that the foundations of sport were courtesy and fairness, and he condemned the prevalence of verbal jousting in the modern game.<ref name=\"az\"/> During his career, Booth often spoke at religious functions in combination with other Christian cricketers. He appeared with the English Test opener Reverend [[David Sheppard]] at [[Sydney Town Hall]] and preached with [[Conrad Hunte]] in the West Indies.<ref name=\"r277\"/>\n\nDespite Booth's views being more genteel than that of most of his teammates, there was minimal friction or disconnect.<ref name=h257/> Early in his state career, Booth declined to join a [[Melbourne Cup]] gambling sweep organised by captain [[Keith Miller]]. However, Miller included Booth in the event by assigning him to look after the money.<ref name=h257/> Booth said \"That was typical of Keith. That he was able to turn something that might have been a problem into something positive, giving me a responsibility, making me feel part of the team.\"<ref name=h258/> He added \"The boys just accepted me for what I was. If they didn't share the strength of my convictions, they were quite happy for me to hold them.\"<ref name=h258/> Simpson said that Booth never attempted to impose his worldview on his teammates and never gave any inkling that he disapproved of their behaviour.<ref name=h258/>\n\n==Outside cricket==\nAfter retirement, Booth resumed full-time duties as a Sydney schoolmaster. He spent 12 years as a teacher in the government secondary schools of New South Wales before becoming an instructor in physical education at Sydney Teachers College in 1967. Before retiring in 1989, Booth served as the head of the Health and Human Movement Studies Department at the [[Sydney Institute of Education]]&mdash;the successor of the STC&mdash;for five years.<ref name=\"az\"/> In 1958, he married Judith Williams, whom he met at STC.

October 1933) is a former [[Australian cricket team|Australian cricketer]] who played in 29 [[Test cricket|Tests]] from 1961 to 1966, and 93 [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches for New South Wales. He captained [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] for two Tests during the 1965&ndash;66 [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series while regular captain [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] was absent due to illness and injury. Booth was a graceful right-handed middle order batsman at No. 4 or 5, and occasionally bowled right arm [[pace bowling|medium pace]] or [[off spin]]. He had an inclination to use his feet to charge [[spin bowling|spin bowlers]]. Booth was known for his [[sportsmanship]] on the field and often invoked [[Sydney Anglicans|Christianity]] while discussing ethics and sport.\n\nBorn near the [[New South Wales]] country town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], Booth moved to Sydney in 1952 and played in the [[Sydney Grade Cricket|grade cricket]] competition while training to become a teacher. He made his first-class debut for the [[New South Wales cricket team]] and came to prominence in dramatic circumstances in his second match, against the touring [[England cricket team|Englishmen]] in 1954&ndash;55. Due to late withdrawals, Booth was selected at late notice and had to be called from work on the morning of the match. After arriving after the start of the match, he scored 74 following a batting collapse. Booth struggled to make an impression early in his career and missed a season to train and with the Australian [[field hockey]] team for the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]]. Upon returning to first-class cricket in 1957&ndash;58, he held down a regular position in the state team while the Test players were touring overseas. Booth gradually progressed and gained selection on the 1959&ndash;60 Australian Second XI tour to [[New Zealand]].\n\nBooth was selected for the Australian team that toured England in 1961 and played in the final two Tests. Upon his return to Australia, Booth made two [[century (cricket)|centuries]] in the 1962&ndash;63 home Test series against England, establishing himself in the Test team. He made two further centuries the following summer against [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] and was named the Australian player of the year. Following the retirement of [[Richie Benaud]], Booth was appointed vice-captain under Simpson as Australia embarked on a successful 1964 tour of England, which saw the retention of the Ashes. Booth played his final Test series in 1965&ndash;66 against England, captaining Australia in the First and Third Tests because Simpson was sidelined with a broken wrist and [[chickenpox]] respectively. The First Test was drawn but Australia fell to its first innings defeat in almost ten years in the Third Test. As he was also in a form slump, Booth was dropped as the Australian selectors made mass changes, ending his career. In retirement, Booth returned to his teaching duties and served as an Anglican lay-preacher.

Tall, upright, correct in method, ever-patient, he repeated the hundred he had got at [[the Gabba|Brisbane]], and so gave England a target to go for while all around him were failing. \n:\u2013[[E.W. Swanton]]<ref>[[E. W. Swanton|Swanton, E. W.]] (1977). ''Swanton in Australia with MCC 1946-75''.

He was known for not hitting the ball hard but for having an easy and relaxed style.<ref name=\"p246\"/> In [[Field hockey|hockey]], a player is not allowed to lift his stick above the shoulders; this background strengthened Booth's forearms and wrists and enabled him to impart momentum on the ball without a large swing of the blade.<ref name=\"r274\"/> Booth was particularly known for his [[late cut]] and his [[cover drive]], which he played in a manner not dissimilar to [[Mark Waugh]].<ref name=\"p246\"/> He was known for his quick footwork against [[spin bowling]] and was rarely stumped, and he had the ability to change his batting tempo.<ref name=\"p246\"/> Booth quickly got into position and typically moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps.<ref name=\"r274\"/> A lean player, Booth stood 181&nbsp;cm, weighed 66&nbsp;kg and refrained from smoking, gambling and drinking.<ref name=h257/><ref name=az/> He was known for his efficient outfielding, and on the second day of the Second Test against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in [[Trinidad]] in 1964&ndash;65, he [[run out|ran out]] [[Gary Sobers]] and [[Basil Butcher]] with strong throws from the outfield. Booth started as a part-time [[leg spin]]ner before converting to [[off spin]].<ref name=\"az\"/>\n\nBooth had a reputation for walking when he knew that he was out, without waiting for the [[Umpire (cricket)|umpire's]] decision, and he was regarded as a player and leader of the highest principles.<ref name=\"r277\"/><ref name=\"p245\"/> He was known for his record of instilling high standards of conduct into his players and prevented them from showing dissent towards unfavourable umpiring decisions.<ref name=\"r277\">Robinson, p. 277.</ref> Robinson said that \"if a prize were offered for fairplaymanship among Australia's post-war cricketers Brian Booth ought to win it hands down\".<ref name=\"r279\">Robinson, p. 279.</ref> Lawry regarded Booth as one of the most gentlemanly cricketers that he knew.<ref>Coleman, p. 592.</ref>\n\nA committed [[Christianity|Christian]], Booth is an [[Anglican]] lay-preacher,<ref name=\"p245\"/> and often invokes religious and ethical arguments while talking about issues such as [[sportsmanship]]. Booth became intensely religious in the 1950s after befriending Pastor Roy Gray, a colleague in district cricket and a classmate at Sydney Teachers College.<ref name=h257/> Gray challenged his friend's faith, and Booth reflected that \"Until that point, sport had really been my God\".<ref name=h257/> During Booth's career, the media made much of his religious convictions. After scoring his maiden Test century, Booth was asked whether he felt that God was with him.<ref name=h258>Haigh, p. 258.</ref> He replied in the affirmative, and the next day, a newspaper printed the headline \"England can't win. God is on Brian Booth's side.\"<ref name=h258/>\n\nBooth co-authored ''Cricket and Christianity'' with [[Paul White (missionary)|Paul White]] and wrote ''Hockey Fundamentals'' and ''Booth to Bat''. In 1998 he wrote ''Sport and sportsmanship: a Christian perspective towards 2000'' for the Australian Christian Forum on Education. He believed that the foundations of sport were courtesy and fairness, and he condemned the prevalence of verbal jousting in the modern game.<ref name=\"az\"/> During his career, Booth often spoke at religious functions in combination with other Christian cricketers. He appeared with the English Test opener Reverend [[David Sheppard]] at [[Sydney Town Hall]] and preached with [[Conrad Hunte]] in the West Indies.<ref name=\"r277\"/>\n\nDespite Booth's views being more genteel than that of most of his teammates, there was minimal friction or disconnect.<ref name=h257/> Early in his state career, Booth declined to join a [[Melbourne Cup]] gambling sweep organised by captain [[Keith Miller]]. However, Miller included Booth in the event by assigning him to look after the money.<ref name=h257/> Booth said \"That was typical of Keith. That he was able to turn something that might have been a problem into something positive, giving me a responsibility, making me feel part of the team.\"<ref name=h258/> He added \"The boys just accepted me for what I was. If they didn't share the strength of my convictions, they were quite happy for me to hold them.\"<ref name=h258/> Simpson said that Booth never attempted to impose his worldview on his teammates and never gave any inkling that he disapproved of their behaviour.<ref name=h258/>\n\n==Outside cricket==\nAfter retirement, Booth resumed full-time duties as a Sydney schoolmaster. He spent 12 years as a teacher in the government secondary schools of New South Wales before becoming an instructor in physical education at Sydney Teachers College in 1967. Before retiring in 1989, Booth served as the head of the Health and Human Movement Studies Department at the [[Sydney Institute of Education]]&mdash;the successor of the STC&mdash;for five years.<ref name=\"az\"/> In 1958, he married Judith Williams, whom he met at STC.

He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested [[Gaston Leroux]]'s book ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' as a basis.

Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: \"I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that ever since I started my career.

Carlotta, the Op\u00e9ra's resident soprano [[prima donna]], begins to perform an aria for the new managers when a backdrop inexplicably falls from the flies, barely missing her and prompting anxious chorus girls to whisper, \"He's here! The Phantom of the Opera!\". The managers try to downplay the incident, but Carlotta angrily insists that such things have been happening for \"three years\" and she storms out, quitting the show. Madame Giry, the Op\u00e9ra's [[Ballet master|ballet mistress]], informs Firmin and Andr\u00e9 that [[Christine Daa\u00e9]], a chorus girl and [[orphan]]ed daughter of a prominent violinist, has been \"well taught\" and can sing Carlotta's role. With cancellation of the sold-out show being their only other alternative, the managers reluctantly audition her and are surprised to discover that she is indeed talented. As Christine sings the [[aria]] during the evening performance, the Op\u00e9ra's new patron, Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny, recognises her as his childhood friend and playmate (\"Think of Me\").\n[[File:PhantomoftheOpera-BoatScene.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman performing the title song]]\n\nBackstage after her triumphant d\u00e9but, Christine confesses to her friend Meg, Madame Giry's daughter, that she knows her mysterious teacher only as an invisible \"Angel of Music\" (\"Angel of Music\") who sings to her in her dreams. Raoul pays a visit to Christine's dressing room and the two reminisce about the \"Angel of Music\" stories that her late father used to tell them. Christine confides that the Angel has visited her and taught her to sing (\"Little Lotte\"). Raoul indulges what he assumes are fantasies and insists on taking Christine to dinner. When Raoul leaves to fetch his hat, Christine hears the jealous Phantom's voice and entreats him to reveal himself. The Phantom obliges by appearing as a ghostly, partially masked face in her mirror (\"The Mirror/Angel of Music (Reprise)\"). Believing him to be the Angel of Music sent by her deceased father, Christine is irresistibly drawn through the mirror to the Phantom, who leads her down into the [[Basement|cellars]] of the Op\u00e9ra house. The two then board a small boat and cross a subterranean lake to his secret lair (\"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]]\"). The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his music and serenades her. When he reveals a mirror that reflects an image of her in a [[wedding dress]], the figure in the mirror gestures to Christine and she [[Syncope (medicine)|faints]] from shock. The Phantom then covers her tenderly with his cloak and puts her on a bed (\"[[The Music of the Night]]\").\n\nAs the Phantom is composing music at his organ, Christine awakens to the sound of the monkey music box (\"I Remember\"). Overcome with curiosity, she slips behind the Phantom, lifts his mask, and beholds his grotesquely disfigured face. The Phantom rails at her prying gesture and Christine runs in fear. He then ruefully expresses his longing to be loved (\"Stranger Than You Dreamt It\"). Moved by pity, Christine returns the mask to the Phantom and he escorts her back above ground.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Joseph Buquet]], the Op\u00e9ra's chief stagehand, regales the chorus girls with tales of the \"Op\u00e9ra Ghost\" and his terrible Punjab lasso. Madame Giry arrives and warns Buquet to exercise restraint or face the Phantom's wrath (\"Magical Lasso\"). In the managers' office, Andr\u00e9 and Firman read notes from the Phantom and are interrupted by Raoul, who accuses them of sending him a note saying that he should make no attempt to see Christine again. Carlotta and Piangi then burst in, demanding to know who sent Carlotta a note warning that her \"days at the Op\u00e9ra Populaire are numbered.\" As Andr\u00e9 and Firmin try to calm Carlotta, Madame Giry delivers another note from the Phantom: he demands that Christine replace Carlotta as the Countess in the new opera, ''Il Muto,'' and that Box 5 be kept empty for him. The managers are warned they will face a \"disaster beyond imagination\" if these demands are not met (\"Notes\"). Firmin and Andr\u00e9 assure the furious Carlotta that she will remain their star and Christine will play the Pageboy, a silent role (\"Prima Donna\").\n\nThe premi\u00e8re of ''Il Muto'' initially goes well, until the voice of the Phantom suddenly cuts through the performance, enraged that Box 5 was not kept empty for him as he had directed. As Christine whispers that she knows the Phantom is near, Carlotta reminds her that her role is silent, calling her a \"little [[toad]]\". The Phantom states that it is Carlotta who is the toad and reduces the diva's voice to a [[frog]]-like croak. Firmin rushes to defuse the situation by announcing to the audience that Christine will take over the starring role, and he instructs the conductor to bring the ballet forward to keep the audience entertained. Suddenly, the [[Cadaver|corpse]] of Joseph Buquet drops from the rafters, hanging from the Punjab lasso. Firmin and Andr\u00e9 plead for calm as mayhem erupts and the Phantom's sinister laugh is heard throughout the auditorium (\"Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh\").\n\nIn the ensuing chaos after \"Il Muto\", Christine escapes with Raoul to the roof and tells him about her subterranean encounter with the Phantom (\"Why Have You Brought Me Here?/Raoul, I've Been There\"). Raoul is skeptical but promises to love and protect her; Christine reciprocates his vow (\"[[All I Ask of You]]\"). Christine and Raoul go back inside, unaware that the Phantom has overheard their entire conversation. The heartbroken Phantom angrily vows revenge before returning to the auditorium and crashing the [[chandelier]] onto the stage during the curtain call (\"All I Ask of You (reprise)\").\n\n===Act Il===\n[[File:PotOFinalScene.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Steve Barton and Sarah Brightman in the final scene]]\n(''Entr'acte'') Six months later, during a [[masquerade ball]], the Phantom appears in costume as the [[The Masque of the Red Death|Red Death]]. He announces that he has written an opera entitled ''[[Don Juan Triumphant]]'' and demands that it be produced with Christine (who is now secretly engaged to Raoul) in the lead role, and he warns of dire consequences if his demands are not met. Noticing an engagement ring on a chain around Christine's neck, the Phantom angrily pulls it from her and vanishes in a blinding flash of light (\"Masquerade/Why So Silent\").\n\nAs the masquerade attendees scatter in fear, Raoul accosts Madame Giry and demands that she reveal what she knows about the Phantom. Madame Giry reluctantly explains that the Phantom is actually a brilliant scholar, magician, architect, inventor, and composer who was born with a terrifyingly deformed face and was ostracized for it. Feared and reviled by society, he was cruelly exhibited in a cage as part of a traveling fair until he eventually escaped and disappeared. He subsequently took refuge beneath the opera house, which has now become his home.\n\nBefore rehearsals, Raoul plots to use the premi\u00e8re of ''Don Juan Triumphant'' as a trap to capture the Phantom and put an end to his reign of terror. Carlotta falsely accuses Christine of being the mastermind, suggesting that it is all a ploy to make her the star. Christine angrily defends herself, explaining that she is his victim just like everyone else. Raoul, knowing of the Phantom's obsession with his fianc\u00e9e, asserts that the Phantom will attend the opera's premi\u00e8re and begs a reluctant Christine to help lure the Phantom into the trap, but she refuses (\"Notes/Twisted Every Way\"). During rehearsal, Piangi is unable to sing his part in the new opera, causing frustration and chaos for everyone. The piano suddenly begins to play the piece by itself (having been possessed by the Phantom) and the entire company immediately sings the proper notes in unison.\n\nTorn between her love for Raoul and her awe of the Phantom, Christine visits her father's grave, longing for his guidance (\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\"). The Phantom appears atop the mausoleum, again under the guise of the Angel of Music (\"Wandering Child\"). The weary Christine begins to succumb to the Phantom's influence, but Raoul arrives to rescue her. The Phantom taunts Raoul, hurling fire balls at him until Christine begs Raoul to leave with her. Furious, the Phantom declares war upon them both and causes flames to spring up around the mausoleum (\"Bravo Monsieur\").\n\nWith armed policemen having secured the auditorium and watching for the Phantom, ''Don Juan Triumphant'' premieres with Christine and Piangi singing the lead roles. During Don Juan's and Aminta's duet, Christine comes to the sudden realization that the Phantom has somehow replaced Piangi (\"Don Juan Triumphant/The Point of No Return\"). Mimicking Raoul's vow of devotion on the rooftop, the Phantom once again expresses his love for Christine and forces his ring onto her finger. Christine rips off his mask, showing his horrifically deformed face to the shocked audience. Exposed, the Phantom hurriedly drags Christine off the stage and back to his lair. Piangi's garroted body is revealed backstage and the opera house plunges into chaos. An angry mob, vowing vengeance for the murders of Buquet and Piangi, search for the Phantom. Madame Giry tells Raoul how to find the Phantom's subterranean lair and warns him to beware the magical lasso. (\"Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer\").\n\nDown in the lair, the Phantom has compelled Christine to don a wedding dress. In a moment of epiphany, she explains that she is not fearful of his physical appearance, but rather his inner nature. Raoul reaches the lair and attempts to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine and begs him for compassion. The Phantom retorts that the world had never shown him any and ensnares Raoul in the Punjab lasso. The Phantom offers Christine an ultimatum: if she will stay with him, he will spare Raoul, but if she refuses, Raoul will die (\"The Point of No Return Reprise\"). As the Phantom and Raoul both vie for Christine, she sadly asks the Phantom what life he has been forced to live. Finally, she tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him, showing him compassion for the first time in his life.\n\nHaving experienced kindness at last, the Phantom realises that he cannot win Christine by force and frees them both. Raoul hurries Christine out of the lair, but she returns alone to give the Phantom back his ring. The Phantom once again pledges his love to her as she tearfully exits the lair to rejoin Raoul. As the angry search mob closes in, the devastated Phantom huddles on his throne beneath his cloak. Meg is first to reach the lair and finds no one there. She approaches the throne with curiosity and quickly pulls away the Phantom's cloak, but finds only his mask. She lifts the mask up into the light and gazes at it in wonder as the curtain falls (\"Finale\").<ref name=\"complete\">{{cite news | first=George | last=Perry | title=The Complete Phantom of the Opera | publisher=Owl Books | year=1991 | isbn=0-8050-1722-4 }}</ref>\n\n==Casting==\n===Original casts===\nThe original casts of the major productions of ''The Phantom of the Opera'':<ref>[http://phantom-media.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=7&id=37&Itemid=56 POTO Onstage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308081115/http://phantom-media.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=7&id=37&Itemid=56 |date=8 March 2009 }}, ''phantom-media.info'' \u2013 accessed 10 May 2009</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://phantom.faithweb.com/productions/toronto/cast.html|title=The Phantom of the Opera Toronto Cast|author=|date=|website=phantom.faithweb.com}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n!

He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested [[Gaston Leroux]]'s book ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' as a basis. They screened both the [[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|1925 Lon Chaney]] and the [[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|1943 Claude Rains]] motion picture versions, but neither saw any effective way to make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: \"I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that ever since I started my career.

Carlotta, the Op\u00e9ra's resident soprano [[prima donna]], begins to perform an aria for the new managers when a backdrop inexplicably falls from the flies, barely missing her and prompting anxious chorus girls to whisper, \"He's here! The Phantom of the Opera!\". The managers try to downplay the incident, but Carlotta angrily insists that such things have been happening for \"three years\" and she storms out, quitting the show. Madame Giry, the Op\u00e9ra's [[Ballet master|ballet mistress]], informs Firmin and Andr\u00e9 that [[Christine Daa\u00e9]], a chorus girl and [[orphan]]ed daughter of a prominent violinist, has been \"well taught\" and can sing Carlotta's role. With cancellation of the sold-out show being their only other alternative, the managers reluctantly audition her and are surprised to discover that she is indeed talented. As Christine sings the [[aria]] during the evening performance, the Op\u00e9ra's new patron, Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny, recognises her as his childhood friend and playmate (\"Think of Me\").\n[[File:PhantomoftheOpera-BoatScene.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman performing the title song]]\n\nBackstage after her triumphant d\u00e9but, Christine confesses to her friend Meg, Madame Giry's daughter, that she knows her mysterious teacher only as an invisible \"Angel of Music\" (\"Angel of Music\") who sings to her in her dreams. Raoul pays a visit to Christine's dressing room and the two reminisce about the \"Angel of Music\" stories that her late father used to tell them. Christine confides that the Angel has visited her and taught her to sing (\"Little Lotte\"). Raoul indulges what he assumes are fantasies and insists on taking Christine to dinner. When Raoul leaves to fetch his hat, Christine hears the jealous Phantom's voice and entreats him to reveal himself. The Phantom obliges by appearing as a ghostly, partially masked face in her mirror (\"The Mirror/Angel of Music (Reprise)\"). Believing him to be the Angel of Music sent by her deceased father, Christine is irresistibly drawn through the mirror to the Phantom, who leads her down into the [[Basement|cellars]] of the Op\u00e9ra house. The two then board a small boat and cross a subterranean lake to his secret lair (\"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]]\"). The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his music and serenades her. When he reveals a mirror that reflects an image of her in a [[wedding dress]], the figure in the mirror gestures to Christine and she [[Syncope (medicine)|faints]] from shock. The Phantom then covers her tenderly with his cloak and puts her on a bed (\"[[The Music of the Night]]\").\n\nAs the Phantom is composing music at his organ, Christine awakens to the sound of the monkey music box (\"I Remember\"). Overcome with curiosity, she slips behind the Phantom, lifts his mask, and beholds his grotesquely disfigured face. The Phantom rails at her prying gesture and Christine runs in fear. He then ruefully expresses his longing to be loved (\"Stranger Than You Dreamt It\"). Moved by pity, Christine returns the mask to the Phantom and he escorts her back above ground.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Joseph Buquet]], the Op\u00e9ra's chief stagehand, regales the chorus girls with tales of the \"Op\u00e9ra Ghost\" and his terrible Punjab lasso. Madame Giry arrives and warns Buquet to exercise restraint or face the Phantom's wrath (\"Magical Lasso\"). In the managers' office, Andr\u00e9 and Firman read notes from the Phantom and are interrupted by Raoul, who accuses them of sending him a note saying that he should make no attempt to see Christine again. Carlotta and Piangi then burst in, demanding to know who sent Carlotta a note warning that her \"days at the Op\u00e9ra Populaire are numbered.\" As Andr\u00e9 and Firmin try to calm Carlotta, Madame Giry delivers another note from the Phantom: he demands that Christine replace Carlotta as the Countess in the new opera, ''Il Muto,'' and that Box 5 be kept empty for him. The managers are warned they will face a \"disaster beyond imagination\" if these demands are not met (\"Notes\"). Firmin and Andr\u00e9 assure the furious Carlotta that she will remain their star and Christine will play the Pageboy, a silent role (\"Prima Donna\").\n\nThe premi\u00e8re of ''Il Muto'' initially goes well, until the voice of the Phantom suddenly cuts through the performance, enraged that Box 5 was not kept empty for him as he had directed. As Christine whispers that she knows the Phantom is near, Carlotta reminds her that her role is silent, calling her a \"little [[toad]]\". The Phantom states that it is Carlotta who is the toad and reduces the diva's voice to a [[frog]]-like croak. Firmin rushes to defuse the situation by announcing to the audience that Christine will take over the starring role, and he instructs the conductor to bring the ballet forward to keep the audience entertained. Suddenly, the [[Cadaver|corpse]] of Joseph Buquet drops from the rafters, hanging from the Punjab lasso. Firmin and Andr\u00e9 plead for calm as mayhem erupts and the Phantom's sinister laugh is heard throughout the auditorium (\"Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh\").\n\nIn the ensuing chaos after \"Il Muto\", Christine escapes with Raoul to the roof and tells him about her subterranean encounter with the Phantom (\"Why Have You Brought Me Here?/Raoul, I've Been There\"). Raoul is skeptical but promises to love and protect her; Christine reciprocates his vow (\"[[All I Ask of You]]\"). Christine and Raoul go back inside, unaware that the Phantom has overheard their entire conversation. The heartbroken Phantom angrily vows revenge before returning to the auditorium and crashing the [[chandelier]] onto the stage during the curtain call (\"All I Ask of You (reprise)\").\n\n===Act Il===\n[[File:PotOFinalScene.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Steve Barton and Sarah Brightman in the final scene]]\n(''Entr'acte'') Six months later, during a [[masquerade ball]], the Phantom appears in costume as the [[The Masque of the Red Death|Red Death]]. He announces that he has written an opera entitled ''[[Don Juan Triumphant]]'' and demands that it be produced with Christine (who is now secretly engaged to Raoul) in the lead role, and he warns of dire consequences if his demands are not met. Noticing an engagement ring on a chain around Christine's neck, the Phantom angrily pulls it from her and vanishes in a blinding flash of light (\"Masquerade/Why So Silent\").\n\nAs the masquerade attendees scatter in fear, Raoul accosts Madame Giry and demands that she reveal what she knows about the Phantom. Madame Giry reluctantly explains that the Phantom is actually a brilliant scholar, magician, architect, inventor, and composer who was born with a terrifyingly deformed face and was ostracized for it. Feared and reviled by society, he was cruelly exhibited in a cage as part of a traveling fair until he eventually escaped and disappeared. He subsequently took refuge beneath the opera house, which has now become his home.\n\nBefore rehearsals, Raoul plots to use the premi\u00e8re of ''Don Juan Triumphant'' as a trap to capture the Phantom and put an end to his reign of terror. Carlotta falsely accuses Christine of being the mastermind, suggesting that it is all a ploy to make her the star. Christine angrily defends herself, explaining that she is his victim just like everyone else. Raoul, knowing of the Phantom's obsession with his fianc\u00e9e, asserts that the Phantom will attend the opera's premi\u00e8re and begs a reluctant Christine to help lure the Phantom into the trap, but she refuses (\"Notes/Twisted Every Way\"). During rehearsal, Piangi is unable to sing his part in the new opera, causing frustration and chaos for everyone. The piano suddenly begins to play the piece by itself (having been possessed by the Phantom) and the entire company immediately sings the proper notes in unison.\n\nTorn between her love for Raoul and her awe of the Phantom, Christine visits her father's grave, longing for his guidance (\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\"). The Phantom appears atop the mausoleum, again under the guise of the Angel of Music (\"Wandering Child\"). The weary Christine begins to succumb to the Phantom's influence, but Raoul arrives to rescue her. The Phantom taunts Raoul, hurling fire balls at him until Christine begs Raoul to leave with her. Furious, the Phantom declares war upon them both and causes flames to spring up around the mausoleum (\"Bravo Monsieur\").\n\nWith armed policemen having secured the auditorium and watching for the Phantom, ''Don Juan Triumphant'' premieres with Christine and Piangi singing the lead roles. During Don Juan's and Aminta's duet, Christine comes to the sudden realization that the Phantom has somehow replaced Piangi (\"Don Juan Triumphant/The Point of No Return\"). Mimicking Raoul's vow of devotion on the rooftop, the Phantom once again expresses his love for Christine and forces his ring onto her finger. Christine rips off his mask, showing his horrifically deformed face to the shocked audience. Exposed, the Phantom hurriedly drags Christine off the stage and back to his lair. Piangi's garroted body is revealed backstage and the opera house plunges into chaos. An angry mob, vowing vengeance for the murders of Buquet and Piangi, search for the Phantom. Madame Giry tells Raoul how to find the Phantom's subterranean lair and warns him to beware the magical lasso. (\"Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer\").\n\nDown in the lair, the Phantom has compelled Christine to don a wedding dress. In a moment of epiphany, she explains that she is not fearful of his physical appearance, but rather his inner nature. Raoul reaches the lair and attempts to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine and begs him for compassion. The Phantom retorts that the world had never shown him any and ensnares Raoul in the Punjab lasso. The Phantom offers Christine an ultimatum: if she will stay with him, he will spare Raoul, but if she refuses, Raoul will die (\"The Point of No Return Reprise\"). As the Phantom and Raoul both vie for Christine, she sadly asks the Phantom what life he has been forced to live. Finally, she tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him, showing him compassion for the first time in his life.\n\nHaving experienced kindness at last, the Phantom realises that he cannot win Christine by force and frees them both. Raoul hurries Christine out of the lair, but she returns alone to give the Phantom back his ring. The Phantom once again pledges his love to her as she tearfully exits the lair to rejoin Raoul. As the angry search mob closes in, the devastated Phantom huddles on his throne beneath his cloak. Meg is first to reach the lair and finds no one there. She approaches the throne with curiosity and quickly pulls away the Phantom's cloak, but finds only his mask. She lifts the mask up into the light and gazes at it in wonder as the curtain falls (\"Finale\").<ref name=\"complete\">{{cite news | first=George | last=Perry | title=The Complete Phantom of the Opera | publisher=Owl Books | year=1991 | isbn=0-8050-1722-4 }}</ref>\n\n==Casting==\n===Original casts===\nThe original casts of the major productions of ''The Phantom of the Opera'':<ref>[http://phantom-media.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=7&id=37&Itemid=56 POTO Onstage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308081115/http://phantom-media.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=7&id=37&Itemid=56 |date=8 March 2009 }}, ''phantom-media.info'' \u2013 accessed 10 May 2009</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://phantom.faithweb.com/productions/toronto/cast.html|title=The Phantom of the Opera Toronto Cast|author=|date=|website=phantom.faithweb.com}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n!
