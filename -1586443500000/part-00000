He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1921 Iles continued to play for Tauranga, scoring a try in a match against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He also played for Tauranga against Te Puke and despite recently joining the rugby code was named captain\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kusabs' Cup Match Next Saturday\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7710\n| date = 1921-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210602.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid.

He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors.

He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid.

It is the second largest borough of the city by area and, with over 26,000 inhabitants the second-most populated of Wiesbaden's suburban boroughs. It was the largest village in the former [[Nassau (state)|Duchy of Nassau]]. The formerly independent village was incorporated into Wiesbaden in 1928.<ref name = \"OfficialSite\">[http://www.wiesbaden.de/dotzheim Official borough page on City of Wiesbaden website]. Retrieved on 2009-01-13</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nDotzheim is located in the northwest of Wiesbaden.  To the north and northwest are the wooded slopes of the ''Hochtaunus'', or High [[Taunus]] Mountains. The primary peaks along its northern boundary are ''Hohe Wurzel'' (618 m) and ''Schl\u00e4ferskopf'' (454 m). The ''Weilburger Tal'' (Wielburg Valley), a valley complex formed by the ''Wielburger Bach'' stream and its tributaries, leads south from the mountains. After passing through the old village center, the stream enters the more extensive ''Belzbachtal''. The ridges that border the ''Belzbach'' valley are the ''Schiersteiner Hang'' (Schierstein Slope) on the west and the ''Wiesbadener Kessel'' on the east.<ref name = \"OfficialSite\" /> As the ''Belzbach'' enters the borough of [[Wiesbaden-Biebrich|Biebrich]], it becomes the ''Mosbach'', which flows into the [[Rhine]] at Biebrich Castle.\n\n===Neighboring communities===\nDotzheim is bordered on the northwest by the municipality of [[Taunusstein]] and on the other sides by other boroughs of Wiesbaden.  These are [[Wiesbaden-Klarenthal|Klarenthal]] and [[Rheingauviertel (Wiesbaden)|Rheingauviertel]] to the northeast, [[Wiesbaden-Biebrich|Biebrich]] to the southeast, [[Wiesbaden-Schierstein|Schierstein]] to the south, and [[Wiesbaden-Frauenstein|Frauenstein]] to the southwest.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early history===\nThe oldest evidence of settlement in the Belzbachtal comes from five closely spaced [[Celts|Celtic]] stone box graves (or [[cists]]) discovered in the area of Hohlstra\u00dfe 3. The graves, made of uncut slabs of [[quartzite]], are from the [[La T\u00e8ne]] culture of the Late Iron Age - about 400 BC. There is also evidence of settlement from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] era. In 222, the first year of the reign of Emperor [[Severus Alexander]], ''Fortunatus'' and ''Sejus'' dedicated an altar, a fragment of which was discovered.\n\nAfter the collapse of Roman rule in the area and [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Clovis I]] [[Merovingian]]\u2019s later defeat of the [[Alamanni]], Frankish settlement of the area began, especially under King [[Dagobert I]] (623 to 638). At that time, it is conjectured, a nobleman named Tuzzo or Tuozo settled in the Belzbachtal and gave his name to the place - Tuozesheim became Tozesheim and eventually Dotzheim.<ref name = \"KoppHistory\">[http://www.wiesbaden.de/leben_wi/stadtteile/dotzheim/geschichte.php Dotzheim - Gestern und heute] (Dotzheim - Yesterday and Today) by Klaus Kopp, Dotzheim borough page on City of Wiesbaden website. Retrieved 2009-01-13.</ref>\n\nThe first written document which mentions Dotzheim dates to only 1128. At this time the [[Archbishop of Mainz]], [[Adalbert of Mainz|Adalbert I von Saarbr\u00fccken]], gave the [[Mainz Cathedral]] the income from the possessions of the local landowners. In another document, dated 21 November 1184, [[Pope Lucius III]] (1181 to 1185) in [[Verona]] confirmed the Mainz [[Benedictine]] [[St. Alban's Abbey, Mainz|monastery of St. Alban\u2019s]] possession of 25 churches, including that of Dotzheim. The monastery of V\u00f6gte was established in Dotzheim, to which such well-known families such as the Treasurer of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], the Br\u00f6mser of [[R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein|R\u00fcdesheim]], and the Knight of Sickingen belonged. Besides the clergy of Mainz (the Mainz Cathedral, St. Alban\u2019s, St. Clare\u2019s, and the Karth\u00e4user Monasteries, and St. John's Convent), the monasteries of [[Eberbach Abbey|Eberbach]] and Klarenthal also received income from Dotzheim.  In a deed from Eberbach dated 24 June 1275 is the first mention of wine in Dotzheim - Knight Philipp von [[Wiesbaden-Frauenstein|Frauenstein]] donated some property in Dotzheim, consisting of a mill and twelve vineyards, to the monastery.<ref name = \"KoppHistory\" />\n\nThe beginnings of the rule of the [[House of Nassau]] in and around Dotzheim are unknown. A document from 1310 testifies that Dotzheim owed Nassau taxes and services. The [[Lords of Eppstein]] had held the jurisdiction in the 13th century, but at some point control passed to the House of Nassau.\n\nThe 13th and 14th-centuries mark the first mention of aristocratic families named \"von Dotzheim.\u201d The Knight Siegfried von Dotzheim (died 1316) donated to the Eberbach Abbey the first of its nine Gothic side chapels. Siegfried was buried there and his gravestone with his coat of arms (with three crowing jackdaws in the upper section) can still be seen. The nobles Sibodo (died 1331) and Catherine von Dotzheim are buried in the Klarenthal Monastery.<ref name = \"KoppHistory\" />\n\nThe village court of Dotzheim is first mentioned in writing in 1386. This can therefore be regarded as the beginning of local self-government. From 1430, there is evidence that the village was protected by fences and gates.\n\nIn 1569, Johann Lonicerus was introduced as the first Protestant minister. In 1610, about 50 percent of the houses were destroyed by a serious fire. In 1644, almost all the inhabitants of Dotzheim fled from their home during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. It took the village decades to recover from the consequences of the war.\n\nThe Protestant parsonage opposite the village church was built in 1695, followed by a schoolhouse in 1698. The new building of the parish church dates from 1716 to 1718.\n\n===Modern era===\n\nThe population increased significantly in the 18th Century as many construction workers, involved in the development of the \u201cspa city\u201d of Wiesbaden, settled in Dotzheim. In 1889, Dotzheim was connected to the Langenschwalbacher railway (later called the [[Aartalbahn]]) and a thriving industrial and commercial area grew up around the station. German Federal Railways ([[Deutsche Bundesbahn]]) discontinued service on this line in 1983, but the line still exists and the Nassau Touristic Railway operates a museum train on it.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, under the administrations of the last three B\u00fcrgermeister (mayors) of Dotzheim, namely Georg Heil (1881 to 1901), August Rossel (1901 to 1913) and Eduard Spork Horst (1913 to 1928), the village got a new town hall, three schools, and a forest cemetery. A development plan was implemented, which even put valuable agricultural parts of the village under protection. By 1906 Dotzheim was connected to the local gas, water and electricity supply network. A streetcar line between Wiesbaden and Dotzheim was also established. The post office at the upper Wiesbadener Stra\u00dfe was built in 1901 (it closed in 1997).\n\nShortly before the outbreak of World War I, Dotzheim had about 6,200 residents and proudly described itself as \"the largest village in the lands of Nassau. In 1928 the independent village was incorporated into Wiesbaden.\n\nThe re-armament efforts in the era of [[National Socialism]] brought extensive barracks buildings in Kohlheck and Freudenberg. Dotzheim survived [[World War II]] virtually unscathed. A deep, wide crater in the northwestern Weilburg valley does testify to an attempted bombing raid. After the war, American occupation forces took up residence in the barracks.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the need for housing a large number of refugees and displaced persons, and Wiesbaden\u2019s emergence as the state capital of Hesse, led to extensive development of Dotzheim. The neighborhoods of Freudenberg and M\u00e4rchenland had already been started in the 1930s. Now a number of new residential developments were built around the borough, including Kohlheck, Schelmengraben, and Sauerland. Schelmengraben, a development of 2,500 homes for 7,000 people, was the conception of urban planner Professor May. After the withdrawal of some of the American military forces from the area, the more recent development of \"Auf der Heide\" has emerged from the redevelopment of the barracks area in front of Freudenberg Castle.\n\n==Coat of arms==\n[[Image:Antoniterkloster H\u00f6chst Antoniterkreuz.jpg|thumb|St. Anthony's Cross, displayed here on the former [[Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony|Antonine]] hospital in [[Frankfurt-H\u00f6chst]], is one possible source of the Dotzheim coat of arms]]The coat of arms of Dotzheim consists simply of a black Latin letter \u201cT.\u201d This coat of arms was officially adopted in 1951 and approved by the City of Wiesbaden. The same coat of arms has appeared on all of the historic seals of the town. The oldest seal, with prints dating from 1551 and 1585, was adopted as the Counts of Nassau enforced their national sovereignty in the 16th Century. The meaning of the T is not known. Various theories are that it may represent the first letter of the name of the founder of the town, the original initial of the village itself, or the Cross of [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]].<ref>\"Hessisches Ortswappenbuch\", Demandt und Renkhoff, Gl\u00fccksburg, CA Starke Verlag 1956.

Annual events include \"Dotzheimer Days\", the Kohlheck Veranstaltungsprogramm, and the ''Dibbemarkt'' which takes place annually in September on the central Pfarrer-Luja-Platz.  The [[Aartalbahn]] is a museum train which operates between the Dotzheim station (''bahnhof'') and Hohenstein Castle (Nassauische Touristikbahn e.V.). Other attractions are the rediscovered ancient Dotzheimer wine ''Judenkirsch'', the attractive ''Heimat'' (Heritage) Museum, and the Castle Freudenberg with its exhibition \"experience for the senses\" and the adjacent \"smallest museum in the world\" \u2013 a piece of cake with peepholes. There are also celebrations in the Freudenberg, Sauerland und Schelmengraben neighborhoods, and the Wine Festival in the local wine estates.\n\n===Schloss Freudenberg===\n[[Image:Schloss Freudenberg in Wiesbaden von S\u00fcden.jpg|thumb|Freudenberg Castle in the midst of its park|225px]]Freudenberg Castle (''Schlo\u00df Freudenberg'') in Dotzheim was built in 1904 by [[Paul Schultze-Naumburg]] as a palace in the middle of a park. His clients were Scottish painter [[:de:James Pitcairn-Knowles|James Pitcairn-Knowles]] <small>{{in lang|de}}</small> (1863\u20131954) and Marie-Eug\u00e9nie-Gu\u00e9rinet Victoria (1870\u20131959). The couple lived in the castle for only three years.\n\nAround 1920, the Landkreis Essen operated a children's home there, which subsequently was taken over by the city of Essen. The operation lasted until 1931. During the time of [[National Socialism]], Schlo\u00df Freudenberg became, first, the \u201cTaunusblick Children's Home,\u201d and then a mothers\u2019 home for [[Lebensborn]]. Lebensborn, according to Nazi [[racial hygiene]] [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|ideology]], sought to increase the birth rate of \"Aryan\" children through extramarital relationships.\n\nAfter 1945, until the 1970s, the [[United States Army]] operated a [[casino]] in the castle for officers stationed at the nearby barracks of Camp Pieri. It was later used by the International [[Pentecostal Church]] of Wiesbaden. In 1973, the U.S. Army gave the castle over to the German ''[[Bundesverm\u00f6gensverwaltung]]'' (federal asset management). Abandoned in 1983, the building eventually fell into an extreme state of disrepair.\n\nIn 1993, the Nature and Art Society, a charitable initiative of Matthias Schenk and Beatrice Dastis Schenk, took over the castle and park and began a restoration of the building. The Schenks were students of [[Hugo K\u00fckelhaus]] (1900\u20131984), who developed the idea of field experience to develop the senses and the mind. From 1975 until his death in 1984, K\u00fckelhaus toured Germany with a caravan of circus tents and \u201cexperience stations.\u201d The Schenks then continued touring, until choosing Schloss Freudenberg as the permanent home of the Experience Field.\n\nAt the beginning of the renovation in 1994, Emil H\u00e4dler, a professor at Fachhochschule Mainz and an expert in building maintenance, formulated the motto \u201cRenovation = Healing through Art.\u201d This principle, the curative effect of art, has become a model for other projects. Another guiding principle is allowing use and redevelopment to run continuously in parallel, turning the renovation into a space with its own kind of experience\u2014a constantly changing temporary opening of new possibilities of perception. The redevelopment project is expected to last until 2030.\n\nIn addition to the ideas of K\u00fckelhaus, the artistic renovation also applies the ideas of [[anthroposophy]], founded by [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861\u20131925) and those of [[social sculpture]], founded by [[Joseph Beuys]] (1921\u20131986). Numerous events about these concepts take place at the castle.\n\nWith support from the city of Wiesbaden, the Nature and Art Society maintains a unique cultural center at the castle and its surrounding 16 [[hectare]] grounds. The focal point is the so-called \u201cexperience for the senses\u201d, which with over 80 interactive experience stations, with instruments and tests according to the models of K\u00fckelhaus.\n\nSchloss Freudenberg's cafe offers refreshments and desserts made at Mechtildehausen's bakery, a local organic and communal farm. \u201c''Der Dunkelbar''\u201d (\u201cThe Dark Bar\u201d) serves food and drink in complete darkness.<ref>[http://www.schlossfreudenberg.de/english/english.html Schloss Freudenberg].

The mill was located on the \"Elfelder Weg\", today's Stra\u00dfenm\u00fchlweg. In medieval times, this road connected Wiesbaden with the Rheingau, via on Freudenberg, the guest house \"Zur Heide,\" and Oberwalluf (Rennpfad). The historic structure now operates as a guest house and restaurant.\n\nThe original deed was issued to Franz Klein of Bingen by Count Friederich Ludwig of Nassau Saarbr\u00fccken and Saar, Lord of Lahr, Wiesbaden, and Idstein. The mill went through numerous owners over the years. Between 1860 and 1889 alone, it went through nine sales. It particularly suffered during the War of 1795. The owners began operating a restaurant at the mill in 1890. It soon became a popular locale. As a mill, the Stra\u00dfenm\u00fchle ceased operations in 1927. The small mill could not compete with the larger mills as farmers began selling their grain to cooperatives and small customers could not run the operation.\n\nA millstone from the mill was found by chance. Made of sandstone, the \u201crunner\u201d measures 94&nbsp;cm in diameter and 24&nbsp;cm in thickness and now stands in the establishment's garden. The original \"overshot\" mill wheel measured 6 m in diameter and approximately 0.6 m in thickness. It was powered by water from a millrace, which diverged from the Belzbach in the center of Dotzheim. It was about 1.1&nbsp;km long and 80&nbsp;cm wide.<ref>[http://www.diestrassenmuehle.de Die Stra\u00dfenm\u00fchle website]. Retrieved on 2009-01-17.</ref>\n\n==Religious life==\n\n===Roman Catholic community===\nThe first written mention of the Dotzheimer church comes from the year 1128. In 1569, the country's Lord, Count Philipp von Nassau-Idstein, introduced the first [[Protestant]] pastor to Dotzheim. Catholics from Dotzheim, whose existence has been documented since 1696, could only worship in [[Wiesbaden-Frauenstein|Frauenstein]].\n\nAs the number of Catholics in Dotzheim increasingly grew at the end of the 19th century, money was collected to build a Catholic church. On 8 December 1901, the Mass was offered again in Dotzheim for the first time since the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The service was conducted in the old school, because the church was not ready. On 31 March 1902 (Easter Monday), the church was solemnly inaugurated and dedicated to [[St. Joseph]]. Dotzheim was not its own parish, but organizationally belonged to Frauenstein until 1926.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], on the night of 2\u20133 February 1945, St. Joseph's Church was burned during a bombing raid. It was only roughly restored afterward. In 1955, the church was expanded and a large tower added, but by the 1970s, the church was again too small. It was demolished in 1976, and the church and rectory were replaced with a modern community center, with the church on one side and the rectory and parish office on the other. Bishop Gerhard Pieschl inaugurated the facility on 3 February 1978.\n\nThe structure of St. Joseph's Church is impressive with massive, geometric shapes such as rectangles, triangles, and cylindars, covered with a pyramidal roof. The exterior and the interior of the church are covered with a rustic plaster, the \"trademark\" of the architect Justus Dahinden. Built in the style of the 1970s, when churches were understood as multi-functional rooms, the Church of St. Joseph still has a strong religious character. It has windows of completely transparent glass, an ox-blood red color on the inside, indirect lighting, and pale wood. The Easter candlesticks and a Cross with Christ Enthroned in a [[mandorla]] (wood) were designed by the Wiesbaden artist Clemens Schmidt. The organ in St. Joseph's, built in the French style by the organ workshop of Alfred Wild in [[Saverne]], [[Alsace]], [[France]], has 20 registers including \u201cSpanish Trumpets.\u201d The construction of the organ, inaugurated on 19 March 1994, was completed in 2003. The St. Joseph Parish Center next to the church includes a kindergarten, cafeteria, meeting rooms and a bowling alley.<ref>[http://www.st-josef-dotzheim.de/html/kirche.html St. Joseph\u2019s Parish website].

Designed by the architect Johannes Jackel of Berlin, the building is meant to be a symbol of the path of God with people, as shown in the example of the [[Virgin Mary]]. It forms the shape of a giant letter \u201cM\u201d (for Mary) when viewed from the west. Its ground plan is shaped like a Star of David, because Mary was of the Jewish people. The dominant construction materials of the church are concrete, Rhenish slate, and glass. One of the largest stained-glass church windows in the world allows the altar area to be flooded with light and the narrow east wall to be illuminated with reflected light.<ref>[http://www.mariae.de/kirche.htm Visitation of Mary Parish website].

These are the central village church on the Roemergasse, the Dreikoenigsgemeinde (Three Kings Community) in Freudenberg, the Paul-Gerhardt-Kirche in Kohlheck (named for famous German Lutheran hymn writer, [[Paul Gerhardt]]), the Erl\u00f6sergemeinde (Deliverer Community) in Sauerland, and the community church of Schelmengraben.<ref>[http://www.kirchen-wiesbaden.de Churches in Wiesbaden].

It has organized activities in association football, badminton, team handball, Radball (cycle polo), judo and Ju-Jitsu, table tennis, chess, and sports for seniors and the disabled. With 2400 members and employing more than 40 licensed trainers, Wiesbaden-TuS Dotzheimer is one of the largest clubs in Wiesbaden.\n\nThe \"Turnverein Dotzheim\" (Dotzheim gymnastics club) was founded in the Revolution year of 1848. In 1875, the club built its first Turnhalle (gymnasium) on Frauensteiner Strasse. The construction and dedication of the Turnerheim took place in 1895. In 1914, the gymnasium was taken for war purposes and in 1921 the Turnerheim was seized by the French occupation forces. In 1925, a new Notturnhalle was constructed on Erich Ollenhauer-Str. as a training facility for gymnastics, fistball, and handball. From 1939 through 1945, almost the entire membership was involved in active military service, leading to a total collapse of the club until after the war.\n\nAfter World War II, the Allied forces ordered that boroughs with less than 10,000 residents must have only one sports club. For this reason, in December 1945, the TuS Wiesbaden-Dotzheim 1848 eV was organized as the legal successor of the former clubs: Turnverein 1848 eV, Radlerclub 1902 eV (cycling club), Kraftsportverein 1903, Arbeiterturnverein 1908 (workers\u2019 gymnastics club), and the Verein der Sportfreunde 1910 eV (association of sports enthusiasts).\n\nAn independent association football club had existed in Dotzheim since 1910. Today the football department, with over 300 members, is one of the largest divisions of the TuS Wiesbaden-Dotzheim. For the 2008/2009 season, the men's teams compete in the Kreisoberliga and Kreisliga C. Including the youth leagues, TuS Wiesbaden-Dotzheim has a total of 10 football teams.

It is the second largest borough of the city by area and, with over 26,000 inhabitants the second-most populated of Wiesbaden's suburban boroughs. It was the largest village in the former [[Nassau (state)|Duchy of Nassau]]. The formerly independent village was incorporated into Wiesbaden in 1928.<ref name = \"OfficialSite\">[http://www.wiesbaden.de/dotzheim Official borough page on City of Wiesbaden website]. Retrieved on 2009-01-13</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nDotzheim is located in the northwest of Wiesbaden.  To the north and northwest are the wooded slopes of the ''Hochtaunus'', or High [[Taunus]] Mountains. The primary peaks along its northern boundary are ''Hohe Wurzel'' (618 m) and ''Schl\u00e4ferskopf'' (454 m). The ''Weilburger Tal'' (Wielburg Valley), a valley complex formed by the ''Wielburger Bach'' stream and its tributaries, leads south from the mountains. After passing through the old village center, the stream enters the more extensive ''Belzbachtal''. The ridges that border the ''Belzbach'' valley are the ''Schiersteiner Hang'' (Schierstein Slope) on the west and the ''Wiesbadener Kessel'' on the east.<ref name = \"OfficialSite\" /> As the ''Belzbach'' enters the borough of [[Wiesbaden-Biebrich|Biebrich]], it becomes the ''Mosbach'', which flows into the [[Rhine]] at Biebrich Castle.\n\n===Neighboring communities===\nDotzheim is bordered on the northwest by the municipality of [[Taunusstein]] and on the other sides by other boroughs of Wiesbaden.  These are [[Wiesbaden-Klarenthal|Klarenthal]] and [[Rheingauviertel (Wiesbaden)|Rheingauviertel]] to the northeast, [[Wiesbaden-Biebrich|Biebrich]] to the southeast, [[Wiesbaden-Schierstein|Schierstein]] to the south, and [[Wiesbaden-Frauenstein|Frauenstein]] to the southwest.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early history===\nThe oldest evidence of settlement in the Belzbachtal comes from five closely spaced [[Celts|Celtic]] stone box graves (or [[cists]]) discovered in the area of Hohlstra\u00dfe 3. The graves, made of uncut slabs of [[quartzite]], are from the [[La T\u00e8ne]] culture of the Late Iron Age - about 400 BC. There is also evidence of settlement from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] era. In 222, the first year of the reign of Emperor [[Severus Alexander]], ''Fortunatus'' and ''Sejus'' dedicated an altar, a fragment of which was discovered.\n\nAfter the collapse of Roman rule in the area and [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Clovis I]] [[Merovingian]]\u2019s later defeat of the [[Alamanni]], Frankish settlement of the area began, especially under King [[Dagobert I]] (623 to 638). At that time, it is conjectured, a nobleman named Tuzzo or Tuozo settled in the Belzbachtal and gave his name to the place - Tuozesheim became Tozesheim and eventually Dotzheim.<ref name = \"KoppHistory\">[http://www.wiesbaden.de/leben_wi/stadtteile/dotzheim/geschichte.php Dotzheim - Gestern und heute] (Dotzheim - Yesterday and Today) by Klaus Kopp, Dotzheim borough page on City of Wiesbaden website. Retrieved 2009-01-13.</ref>\n\nThe first written document which mentions Dotzheim dates to only 1128. At this time the [[Archbishop of Mainz]], [[Adalbert of Mainz|Adalbert I von Saarbr\u00fccken]], gave the [[Mainz Cathedral]] the income from the possessions of the local landowners. In another document, dated 21 November 1184, [[Pope Lucius III]] (1181 to 1185) in [[Verona]] confirmed the Mainz [[Benedictine]] [[St. Alban's Abbey, Mainz|monastery of St. Alban\u2019s]] possession of 25 churches, including that of Dotzheim. The monastery of V\u00f6gte was established in Dotzheim, to which such well-known families such as the Treasurer of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], the Br\u00f6mser of [[R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein|R\u00fcdesheim]], and the Knight of Sickingen belonged. Besides the clergy of Mainz (the Mainz Cathedral, St. Alban\u2019s, St. Clare\u2019s, and the Karth\u00e4user Monasteries, and St. John's Convent), the monasteries of [[Eberbach Abbey|Eberbach]] and Klarenthal also received income from Dotzheim.  In a deed from Eberbach dated 24 June 1275 is the first mention of wine in Dotzheim - Knight Philipp von [[Wiesbaden-Frauenstein|Frauenstein]] donated some property in Dotzheim, consisting of a mill and twelve vineyards, to the monastery.<ref name = \"KoppHistory\" />\n\nThe beginnings of the rule of the [[House of Nassau]] in and around Dotzheim are unknown. A document from 1310 testifies that Dotzheim owed Nassau taxes and services. The [[Lords of Eppstein]] had held the jurisdiction in the 13th century, but at some point control passed to the House of Nassau.\n\nThe 13th and 14th-centuries mark the first mention of aristocratic families named \"von Dotzheim.\u201d The Knight Siegfried von Dotzheim (died 1316) donated to the Eberbach Abbey the first of its nine Gothic side chapels. Siegfried was buried there and his gravestone with his coat of arms (with three crowing jackdaws in the upper section) can still be seen. The nobles Sibodo (died 1331) and Catherine von Dotzheim are buried in the Klarenthal Monastery.<ref name = \"KoppHistory\" />\n\nThe village court of Dotzheim is first mentioned in writing in 1386. This can therefore be regarded as the beginning of local self-government. From 1430, there is evidence that the village was protected by fences and gates.\n\nIn 1569, Johann Lonicerus was introduced as the first Protestant minister. In 1610, about 50 percent of the houses were destroyed by a serious fire. In 1644, almost all the inhabitants of Dotzheim fled from their home during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. It took the village decades to recover from the consequences of the war.\n\nThe Protestant parsonage opposite the village church was built in 1695, followed by a schoolhouse in 1698. The new building of the parish church dates from 1716 to 1718.\n\n===Modern era===\n\nThe population increased significantly in the 18th Century as many construction workers, involved in the development of the \u201cspa city\u201d of Wiesbaden, settled in Dotzheim. In 1889, Dotzheim was connected to the Langenschwalbacher railway (later called the [[Aartalbahn]]) and a thriving industrial and commercial area grew up around the station. German Federal Railways ([[Deutsche Bundesbahn]]) discontinued service on this line in 1983, but the line still exists and the Nassau Touristic Railway operates a museum train on it.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, under the administrations of the last three B\u00fcrgermeister (mayors) of Dotzheim, namely Georg Heil (1881 to 1901), August Rossel (1901 to 1913) and Eduard Spork Horst (1913 to 1928), the village got a new town hall, three schools, and a forest cemetery. A development plan was implemented, which even put valuable agricultural parts of the village under protection. By 1906 Dotzheim was connected to the local gas, water and electricity supply network. A streetcar line between Wiesbaden and Dotzheim was also established. The post office at the upper Wiesbadener Stra\u00dfe was built in 1901 (it closed in 1997).\n\nShortly before the outbreak of World War I, Dotzheim had about 6,200 residents and proudly described itself as \"the largest village in the lands of Nassau. In 1928 the independent village was incorporated into Wiesbaden.\n\nThe re-armament efforts in the era of [[National Socialism]] brought extensive barracks buildings in Kohlheck and Freudenberg. Dotzheim survived [[World War II]] virtually unscathed. A deep, wide crater in the northwestern Weilburg valley does testify to an attempted bombing raid. After the war, American occupation forces took up residence in the barracks.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the need for housing a large number of refugees and displaced persons, and Wiesbaden\u2019s emergence as the state capital of Hesse, led to extensive development of Dotzheim. The neighborhoods of Freudenberg and M\u00e4rchenland had already been started in the 1930s. Now a number of new residential developments were built around the borough, including Kohlheck, Schelmengraben, and Sauerland. Schelmengraben, a development of 2,500 homes for 7,000 people, was the conception of urban planner Professor May. After the withdrawal of some of the American military forces from the area, the more recent development of \"Auf der Heide\" has emerged from the redevelopment of the barracks area in front of Freudenberg Castle.\n\n==Coat of arms==\n[[Image:Antoniterkloster H\u00f6chst Antoniterkreuz.jpg|thumb|St. Anthony's Cross, displayed here on the former [[Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony|Antonine]] hospital in [[Frankfurt-H\u00f6chst]], is one possible source of the Dotzheim coat of arms]]The coat of arms of Dotzheim consists simply of a black Latin letter \u201cT.\u201d This coat of arms was officially adopted in 1951 and approved by the City of Wiesbaden. The same coat of arms has appeared on all of the historic seals of the town. The oldest seal, with prints dating from 1551 and 1585, was adopted as the Counts of Nassau enforced their national sovereignty in the 16th Century. The meaning of the T is not known. Various theories are that it may represent the first letter of the name of the founder of the town, the original initial of the village itself, or the Cross of [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]].<ref>\"Hessisches Ortswappenbuch\", Demandt und Renkhoff, Gl\u00fccksburg, CA Starke Verlag 1956.

Annual events include \"Dotzheimer Days\", the Kohlheck Veranstaltungsprogramm, and the ''Dibbemarkt'' which takes place annually in September on the central Pfarrer-Luja-Platz.  The [[Aartalbahn]] is a museum train which operates between the Dotzheim station (''bahnhof'') and Hohenstein Castle (Nassauische Touristikbahn e.V.). Other attractions are the rediscovered ancient Dotzheimer wine ''Judenkirsch'', the attractive ''Heimat'' (Heritage) Museum, and the Castle Freudenberg with its exhibition \"experience for the senses\" and the adjacent \"smallest museum in the world\" \u2013 a piece of cake with peepholes. There are also celebrations in the Freudenberg, Sauerland und Schelmengraben neighborhoods, and the Wine Festival in the local wine estates.\n\n===Schloss Freudenberg===\n[[Image:Schloss Freudenberg in Wiesbaden von S\u00fcden.jpg|thumb|Freudenberg Castle in the midst of its park|225px]]Freudenberg Castle (''Schlo\u00df Freudenberg'') in Dotzheim was built in 1904 by [[Paul Schultze-Naumburg]] as a palace in the middle of a park. His clients were Scottish painter [[:de:James Pitcairn-Knowles|James Pitcairn-Knowles]] <small>{{in lang|de}}</small> (1863\u20131954) and Marie-Eug\u00e9nie-Gu\u00e9rinet Victoria (1870\u20131959). The couple lived in the castle for only three years.\n\nAround 1920, the Landkreis Essen operated a children's home there, which subsequently was taken over by the city of Essen. The operation lasted until 1931. During the time of [[National Socialism]], Schlo\u00df Freudenberg became, first, the \u201cTaunusblick Children's Home,\u201d and then a mothers\u2019 home for [[Lebensborn]]. Lebensborn, according to Nazi [[racial hygiene]] [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|ideology]], sought to increase the birth rate of \"Aryan\" children through extramarital relationships.\n\nAfter 1945, until the 1970s, the [[United States Army]] operated a [[casino]] in the castle for officers stationed at the nearby barracks of Camp Pieri. It was later used by the International [[Pentecostal Church]] of Wiesbaden. In 1973, the U.S. Army gave the castle over to the German ''[[Bundesverm\u00f6gensverwaltung]]'' (federal asset management). Abandoned in 1983, the building eventually fell into an extreme state of disrepair.\n\nIn 1993, the Nature and Art Society, a charitable initiative of Matthias Schenk and Beatrice Dastis Schenk, took over the castle and park and began a restoration of the building. The Schenks were students of [[Hugo K\u00fckelhaus]] (1900\u20131984), who developed the idea of field experience to develop the senses and the mind. From 1975 until his death in 1984, K\u00fckelhaus toured Germany with a caravan of circus tents and \u201cexperience stations.\u201d The Schenks then continued touring, until choosing Schloss Freudenberg as the permanent home of the Experience Field.\n\nAt the beginning of the renovation in 1994, Emil H\u00e4dler, a professor at Fachhochschule Mainz and an expert in building maintenance, formulated the motto \u201cRenovation = Healing through Art.\u201d This principle, the curative effect of art, has become a model for other projects. Another guiding principle is allowing use and redevelopment to run continuously in parallel, turning the renovation into a space with its own kind of experience\u2014a constantly changing temporary opening of new possibilities of perception. The redevelopment project is expected to last until 2030.\n\nIn addition to the ideas of K\u00fckelhaus, the artistic renovation also applies the ideas of [[anthroposophy]], founded by [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861\u20131925) and those of [[social sculpture]], founded by [[Joseph Beuys]] (1921\u20131986). Numerous events about these concepts take place at the castle.\n\nWith support from the city of Wiesbaden, the Nature and Art Society maintains a unique cultural center at the castle and its surrounding 16 [[hectare]] grounds. The focal point is the so-called \u201cexperience for the senses\u201d, which with over 80 interactive experience stations, with instruments and tests according to the models of K\u00fckelhaus.\n\nSchloss Freudenberg's cafe offers refreshments and desserts made at Mechtildehausen's bakery, a local organic and communal farm. \u201c''Der Dunkelbar''\u201d (\u201cThe Dark Bar\u201d) serves food and drink in complete darkness.<ref>[http://www.schlossfreudenberg.de/english/english.html Schloss Freudenberg].

The mill was located on the \"Elfelder Weg\", today's Stra\u00dfenm\u00fchlweg. In medieval times, this road connected Wiesbaden with the Rheingau, via on Freudenberg, the guest house \"Zur Heide,\" and Oberwalluf (Rennpfad). The historic structure now operates as a guest house and restaurant.\n\nThe original deed was issued to Franz Klein of Bingen by Count Friederich Ludwig of Nassau Saarbr\u00fccken and Saar, Lord of Lahr, Wiesbaden, and Idstein. The mill went through numerous owners over the years. Between 1860 and 1889 alone, it went through nine sales. It particularly suffered during the War of 1795. The owners began operating a restaurant at the mill in 1890. It soon became a popular locale. As a mill, the Stra\u00dfenm\u00fchle ceased operations in 1927. The small mill could not compete with the larger mills as farmers began selling their grain to cooperatives and small customers could not run the operation.\n\nA millstone from the mill was found by chance. Made of sandstone, the \u201crunner\u201d measures 94&nbsp;cm in diameter and 24&nbsp;cm in thickness and now stands in the establishment's garden. The original \"overshot\" mill wheel measured 6 m in diameter and approximately 0.6 m in thickness. It was powered by water from a millrace, which diverged from the Belzbach in the center of Dotzheim. It was about 1.1&nbsp;km long and 80&nbsp;cm wide.<ref>[http://www.diestrassenmuehle.de Die Stra\u00dfenm\u00fchle website]. Retrieved on 2009-01-17.</ref>\n\n==Religious life==\n\n===Roman Catholic community===\nThe first written mention of the Dotzheimer church comes from the year 1128. In 1569, the country's Lord, Count Philipp von Nassau-Idstein, introduced the first [[Protestant]] pastor to Dotzheim. Catholics from Dotzheim, whose existence has been documented since 1696, could only worship in [[Wiesbaden-Frauenstein|Frauenstein]].\n\nAs the number of Catholics in Dotzheim increasingly grew at the end of the 19th century, money was collected to build a Catholic church. On 8 December 1901, the Mass was offered again in Dotzheim for the first time since the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The service was conducted in the old school, because the church was not ready. On 31 March 1902 (Easter Monday), the church was solemnly inaugurated and dedicated to [[St. Joseph]]. Dotzheim was not its own parish, but organizationally belonged to Frauenstein until 1926.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], on the night of 2\u20133 February 1945, St. Joseph's Church was burned during a bombing raid. It was only roughly restored afterward. In 1955, the church was expanded and a large tower added, but by the 1970s, the church was again too small. It was demolished in 1976, and the church and rectory were replaced with a modern community center, with the church on one side and the rectory and parish office on the other. Bishop Gerhard Pieschl inaugurated the facility on 3 February 1978.\n\nThe structure of St. Joseph's Church is impressive with massive, geometric shapes such as rectangles, triangles, and cylindars, covered with a pyramidal roof. The exterior and the interior of the church are covered with a rustic plaster, the \"trademark\" of the architect Justus Dahinden. Built in the style of the 1970s, when churches were understood as multi-functional rooms, the Church of St. Joseph still has a strong religious character. It has windows of completely transparent glass, an ox-blood red color on the inside, indirect lighting, and pale wood. The Easter candlesticks and a Cross with Christ Enthroned in a [[mandorla]] (wood) were designed by the Wiesbaden artist Clemens Schmidt. The organ in St. Joseph's, built in the French style by the organ workshop of Alfred Wild in [[Saverne]], [[Alsace]], [[France]], has 20 registers including \u201cSpanish Trumpets.\u201d The construction of the organ, inaugurated on 19 March 1994, was completed in 2003. The St. Joseph Parish Center next to the church includes a kindergarten, cafeteria, meeting rooms and a bowling alley.<ref>[http://www.st-josef-dotzheim.de/html/kirche.html St. Joseph\u2019s Parish website].

Designed by the architect Johannes Jackel of Berlin, the building is meant to be a symbol of the path of God with people, as shown in the example of the [[Virgin Mary]]. It forms the shape of a giant letter \u201cM\u201d (for Mary) when viewed from the west. Its ground plan is shaped like a Star of David, because Mary was of the Jewish people. The dominant construction materials of the church are concrete, Rhenish slate, and glass. One of the largest stained-glass church windows in the world allows the altar area to be flooded with light and the narrow east wall to be illuminated with reflected light.<ref>[http://www.mariae.de/kirche.htm Visitation of Mary Parish website].

It has organized activities in association football, badminton, team handball, Radball (cycle polo), judo and Ju-Jitsu, table tennis, chess, and sports for seniors and the disabled. With 2400 members and employing more than 40 licensed trainers, Wiesbaden-TuS Dotzheimer is one of the largest clubs in Wiesbaden.\n\nThe \"Turnverein Dotzheim\" (Dotzheim gymnastics club) was founded in the Revolution year of 1848. In 1875, the club built its first Turnhalle (gymnasium) on Frauensteiner Strasse. The construction and dedication of the Turnerheim took place in 1895. In 1914, the gymnasium was taken for war purposes and in 1921 the Turnerheim was seized by the French occupation forces. In 1925, a new Notturnhalle was constructed on Erich Ollenhauer-Str. as a training facility for gymnastics, fistball, and handball. From 1939 through 1945, almost the entire membership was involved in active military service, leading to a total collapse of the club until after the war.\n\nAfter World War II, the Allied forces ordered that boroughs with less than 10,000 residents must have only one sports club. For this reason, in December 1945, the TuS Wiesbaden-Dotzheim 1848 eV was organized as the legal successor of the former clubs: Turnverein 1848 eV, Radlerclub 1902 eV (cycling club), Kraftsportverein 1903, Arbeiterturnverein 1908 (workers\u2019 gymnastics club), and the Verein der Sportfreunde 1910 eV (association of sports enthusiasts).\n\nAn independent association football club had existed in Dotzheim since 1910. Today the football department, with over 300 members, is one of the largest divisions of the TuS Wiesbaden-Dotzheim. For the 2008/2009 season, the men's teams compete in the Kreisoberliga and Kreisliga C. Including the youth leagues, TuS Wiesbaden-Dotzheim has a total of 10 football teams.
