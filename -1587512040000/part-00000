Military berets are usually pushed to the right to free the shoulder that bears the rifle on most soldiers, but the armies of some countries, mostly within Europe, South America and Asia have influenced the push to the left.\n\nIn some countries, berets are associated with [[Military elite|elite units]], who often wear berets in more unusual colours. For instance, the [[maroon beret]] is mostly traditional headgear for elite [[airborne forces]] around the world with a few exceptions like the elite [[Russian Airborne Troops]] who instead wear a [[sky blue]] beret or the [[Portuguese Paratroopers]] that wear a [[green beret]].\n[[File:Ranger_para_comando.jpg|thumb|360x360px|All three elite forces units of the [[Portuguese Army]] wear specific berets with their own crests: [[Special Operations Troops Centre|Special Operations ( Rangers )]] wear moss/ dry-green, [[Portuguese Paratroopers|Paratroopers]] wear green, [[Commandos (Portugal)|Commandos]] wear red.

As an officially required military headdress, its use dates back to the [[Carlist Wars]] of Succession for the Spanish Crown in the 1830s by order of [[Carlism|Carlist]] General [[Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui]] who wanted a local and non-costly way to make headgear that was resistant to the mountain weather, easy to care for and could be used on formal occasions.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe French [[Chasseur Alpin|Chasseurs alpins]], created in the early 1880s, were the first regular unit to wear the military beret as a standard headgear.<ref>{{cite book|first=W.Y.|last=Carman|page=26|title=A Dictionary of Military Uniform|ISBN=0-684-15130-8}}</ref> These mountain troops were issued with a uniform which included several features which were innovative for the time, notably the large and floppy blue beret which they still retain.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Mollo|page=200|title=Military Fashion|ISBN=0-214-65349-8}}</ref> This was so unfamiliar a fashion outside France that it had to be described in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' of 1911 as \"a soft cap or [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]]\".<ref>\"Uniforms\", page 587, Volume XXVII ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911 Edition</ref>\n\nBerets have features that make them attractive to the military: they are cheap, easy to make in large numbers, can be manufactured in a wide range of colors, can be rolled up and stuffed into a pocket or beneath the shirt epaulette without damage, and can be worn with headphones (this is one of the reasons why early tank crews adopted the beret). The beret is not so useful in field conditions for the modern infantryman, who requires protective helmets, and non-camouflage versions are seldom seen on operations.\n\nThe beret was found particularly useful as a uniform for armored-vehicle crews, and the [[Royal Tank Regiment|British Tank Corps]] (later Royal Tank Corps) adopted the headdress as early as 1918.\n\nGerman AFV crews in the late 1930s also adopted a beret with the addition of a padded crash helmet inside. The colour black was worn by the Royal Tank Corps later Royal Tank Regiment, since it did not show oil stains picked up inside the interior of a vehicle. [[Black beret]]s continue to be worn by the Royal Tank Regiment, all other British armoured units wear [[blue beret]]s, regiments in many armies also adopted the wearing of berets.\n\nThe wearing of berets of distinctive colors by elite [[special forces]] originated with the British [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], whose [[maroon beret]] was officially approved in July 1942,<ref>{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=Rebecca |date=2010 |title=British Paratrooper 1940\u201345 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nLGdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6 |location= |publisher=Osprey Publishing  |page=6 |isbn=978-1472805126 }}</ref> followed by the [[Commandos (United Kingdom)|Commando Forces]] whose [[green beret]] was approved in October of that year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bull |first=Stephen |date=2010 |title=Commando Tactics: The Second World War |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aH10gy_DENAC&pg=PA98 |location= |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |page=98 |isbn=978-1848840744 }}</ref> The [[United States Army Special Forces]] adopted a darker green beret in 1955, although it was not officially approved until 1961.<ref name=\"www.army.mil\" >{{cite web |url=https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm |title=A Short History of the Use of Berets in the U.S. Army |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010624053826/https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm#History |archive-date=24 June 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Camouflage berets==\n[[File:Vietnam p05.jpg|thumb|right|A U.S. Navy SEAL in Vietnam with a camouflage beret]]\nA '''camouflage beret''' is  intended for use in the battlefield when wearing [[Battledress|combat fatigues]]. They are mostly issued to the likes of [[special forces]], particularly in jungle warfare operations.\n\n===History===\nCamouflage berets possibly originate from the General Service cap \"Cap, General Service\" issued to the British Army in a Khaki material before the introduction of Berets. It was first introduced under \"Army Council Instruction 1407\" of September 1943. This cap was designed to replace the \"Field Service cap\" or \"FS Cap\" that had been worn since the outbreak of war. These caps were issued in priority to units serving overseas. UK based units got theirs later on. It was at first unpopular due to its over large appearance. This cap was not a beret. It was made from several pieces of drab cloth material, whereas a beret was a one piece item. It was based on the Scottish balmoral bonnet in design. First issues were made from the same gaberdine cloth as the old \"FS\" cap. Badges worn on it were the conventional Officers bronze, and OR's badges in both plastic and metal. Units which had special distinctions could still wear these on the \"GS\" cap. The General Service cap was worn by regulation one inch above the eyebrows, with badge over the left eye and the cap pulled down to the right. But many wartime photos will show it worn pushed back on the head, which seemed to be a fashion with many soldiers late in the War.\n\nOfficers could only obtain the cap upon repayment to the RAOC. They were not allowed to buy the cap until their unit had been issued with it wholesale. Higher ranking Officers often got away with wearing a Khaki beret, which was against regulations. Fashion conscious OR's would also risk punishment from NCO's/officers buying one of these for \"walking out\".\n\nNot exactly camouflage but an early example is the Jungle Beret issued to the Australian Army during WW2.<ref>The Australian Army in World War II - Page 57 Mark Johnson {{ISBN|1472805224}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medalsgonemissing.com/index.php?params_to_parse=Uniform-Kit-issued-to-the-AIF-During-WW2/5|title=Uniform & Kit issued to the AIF During WW2|website=www.medalsgonemissing.com}}</ref><ref>http://www.austcdoassocvic.com/history1.htm{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Users===\n*{{flagcountry|Argentina}} - Jungle Troops (Brigada de Monte XII \"General Manuel Obligado\")<ref>The other Cazadores de Monte brigades use Dark Green berets</ref>\n*{{flagcountry|Bolivia}} - Special Forces \"Bolivian Condors\"\n*{{flagcountry|Brazil}} - Jungle Troops\n*{{flagcountry|PRC}} - During the 80s, camo berets were issued to some of the recon forces of PLA.

The Chasseurs alpins wore a distinctive large beret (see above{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}) and Major-General Sir [[Hugh Elles]], the TC's Colonel, realised this style of headdress would be a practical option for his [[tank]] crews, forced to work in a reduced space. He thought, however, that the Chasseur beret was \"too sloppy\" and the [[Basque people|Basque]]-style beret of the French tank crews was \"too skimpy\", so a compromise based on the Scottish [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]] was designed and submitted for the approval of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in November 1923. It was adopted in March 1924.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the use of the black beret was extended to all the regiments of the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] in 1940. The [[maroon beret]] was adopted by the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] in 1941 and the [[green beret]] by the [[British Commandos|Commandos]] in late 1942.

In response, from 1973 through 1979 HQDA permitted local commanders to encourage morale-enhancing uniform distinctions, however these distinctions were only allowed to be worn on the post. Consequently, many units embraced various colored berets, for example Armor and Armored Cavalry units often adopted the black beret. Similarly many other units embraced various colored berets in an attempt to improve dwindling morale. In particular, the First Cavalry Division assigned various colored berets to its three pronged TRICAP approach. In this implementation, Armored Cavalry, Airmobile Infantry units, Air Cavalry units, Division Artillery units, and Division Support units all wore different colored berets, including black, light blue, kelly green, and red. The 101st Airborne Division was authorised a dark blue beret.\n\nIn 1975 all female soldiers of the [[Women's Army Corps]] were authorized to wear a black beret variant as standard headgear for the service uniform.<ref>Stanton, Shelby (1994).

Stackpole Books. p. 223.</ref>\n\nIn 1975 the 172nd Light Infantry Brigade at Fort Richardson & Fort Wainwright, Alaska wore Olive Drab Berets.\n\nIn 2001, Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki ordered the black beret worn as standard headgear army-wide, a controversial decision because it was previously reserved for the Rangers. The Rangers were then authorized to wear a tan beret, exclusive to them. The decision was implemented in hopes of boosting morale among conventional units. However, many soldiers began complaining that the new black beret was not practical with the utility uniform. In June 2011, Army Secretary John McHugh, acting on the recommendations made by Chief of Staff Martin Dempsey and Sergeant Major of the Army Raymond F. Chandler, once again chose the traditional patrol cap to be worn with the utility uniform. The black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion for special ceremonies. The beret remains part of the Army's dress uniform for all units.\n\nUnited States Army berets now use the following distinctive colors:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <center><big>'''US Army'''</big></center>\n! colspan=\"2\" | Color || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00230D;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| [[Green beret|Rifle green]] || [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces qualified soldiers]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:tan;\"| || [[Tan beret|Tan]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] and the [[Ranger School|Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade]] (Soldiers that have served one year in the regiment and are assigned to a [[USASOC]] component may continue to wear the Tan Beret.)\n|-\n| style=\"background:maroon;\"| || [[Maroon beret|Maroon]] || Soldiers assigned to units on active \"jump status,\" better known as Airborne/Parachute units\n|-\n| style=\"background: SaddleBrown;\"| || [[Brown]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[Security Force Assistance Command]] and its subordinate units\n|-\n| style=\"background:#000;\"| || [[Black beret|Black]] || Worn by all soldiers with Army Service Uniform as standard headgear (The [[patrol cap]] is the standard headgear with utility uniforms such as the ACUs; however, the black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion.<ref>{{Cite news |first=C.

The beret is not so useful in field conditions for the modern infantryman, who requires protective helmets, and non-camouflage versions are seldom seen on operations.\n\nThe beret was found particularly useful as a uniform for armored-vehicle crews, and the [[Royal Tank Regiment|British Tank Corps]] (later Royal Tank Corps) adopted the headdress as early as 1918.\n\nGerman AFV crews in the late 1930s also adopted a beret with the addition of a padded crash helmet inside.

They are mostly issued to the likes of [[special forces]], particularly in jungle warfare operations.\n\n===History===\nCamouflage berets possibly originate from the General Service cap \"Cap, General Service\" issued to the British Army in a Khaki material before the introduction of Berets. It was first introduced under \"Army Council Instruction 1407\" of September 1943. This cap was designed to replace the \"Field Service cap\" or \"FS Cap\" that had been worn since the outbreak of war. These caps were issued in priority to units serving overseas. UK based units got theirs later on. It was at first unpopular due to its over large appearance. This cap was not a beret. It was made from several pieces of drab cloth material, whereas a beret was a one piece item. It was based on the Scottish balmoral bonnet in design. First issues were made from the same gaberdine cloth as the old \"FS\" cap. Badges worn on it were the conventional Officers bronze, and OR's badges in both plastic and metal. Units which had special distinctions could still wear these on the \"GS\" cap. The General Service cap was worn by regulation one inch above the eyebrows, with badge over the left eye and the cap pulled down to the right. But many wartime photos will show it worn pushed back on the head, which seemed to be a fashion with many soldiers late in the War.\n\nOfficers could only obtain the cap upon repayment to the RAOC.

The Chasseurs alpins wore a distinctive large beret (see above{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}) and Major-General Sir [[Hugh Elles]], the TC's Colonel, realised this style of headdress would be a practical option for his [[tank]] crews, forced to work in a reduced space. He thought, however, that the Chasseur beret was \"too sloppy\" and the [[Basque people|Basque]]-style beret of the French tank crews was \"too skimpy\", so a compromise based on the Scottish [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]] was designed and submitted for the approval of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in November 1923.

In response, from 1973 through 1979 HQDA permitted local commanders to encourage morale-enhancing uniform distinctions, however these distinctions were only allowed to be worn on the post. Consequently, many units embraced various colored berets, for example Armor and Armored Cavalry units often adopted the black beret. Similarly many other units embraced various colored berets in an attempt to improve dwindling morale. In particular, the First Cavalry Division assigned various colored berets to its three pronged TRICAP approach. In this implementation, Armored Cavalry, Airmobile Infantry units, Air Cavalry units, Division Artillery units, and Division Support units all wore different colored berets, including black, light blue, kelly green, and red. The 101st Airborne Division was authorised a dark blue beret.\n\nIn 1975 all female soldiers of the [[Women's Army Corps]] were authorized to wear a black beret variant as standard headgear for the service uniform.<ref>Stanton, Shelby (1994).

Stackpole Books. p. 223.</ref>\n\nIn 1975 the 172nd Light Infantry Brigade at Fort Richardson & Fort Wainwright, Alaska wore Olive Drab Berets.\n\nIn 2001, Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki ordered the black beret worn as standard headgear army-wide, a controversial decision because it was previously reserved for the Rangers. The Rangers were then authorized to wear a tan beret, exclusive to them. The decision was implemented in hopes of boosting morale among conventional units. However, many soldiers began complaining that the new black beret was not practical with the utility uniform. In June 2011, Army Secretary John McHugh, acting on the recommendations made by Chief of Staff Martin Dempsey and Sergeant Major of the Army Raymond F. Chandler, once again chose the traditional patrol cap to be worn with the utility uniform. The black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion for special ceremonies. The beret remains part of the Army's dress uniform for all units.\n\nUnited States Army berets now use the following distinctive colors:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <center><big>'''US Army'''</big></center>\n! colspan=\"2\" | Color || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00230D;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| [[Green beret|Rifle green]] || [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces qualified soldiers]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:tan;\"| || [[Tan beret|Tan]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] and the [[Ranger School|Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade]] (Soldiers that have served one year in the regiment and are assigned to a [[USASOC]] component may continue to wear the Tan Beret.)\n|-\n| style=\"background:maroon;\"| || [[Maroon beret|Maroon]] || Soldiers assigned to units on active \"jump status,\" better known as Airborne/Parachute units\n|-\n| style=\"background: SaddleBrown;\"| || [[Brown]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[Security Force Assistance Command]] and its subordinate units\n|-\n| style=\"background:#000;\"| || [[Black beret|Black]] || Worn by all soldiers with Army Service Uniform as standard headgear (The [[patrol cap]] is the standard headgear with utility uniforms such as the ACUs; however, the black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion.<ref>{{Cite news |first=C.

During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Navy created special boat teams, unofficially dubbed the [[brown-water navy]], to patrol coastlines, estuaries and rivers.
