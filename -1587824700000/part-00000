The village is located along the upper course of the [[River Witham]] 1.5 miles downstream (north) of [[South Witham]], and approximately {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} south from the nearest major town, [[Grantham]]. It has an estimated population of 143 in around 72 households, at a density of 0.1/hectare.<ref name=census2011/>\n\nThe current civil parish of Colsterworth includes the hamlet of '''Lobthorpe'''.

However a Saxon clay loomweight from around 650 AD was found at Manor Farm in the village and is now being stored at the City and County Museum in [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]].<ref>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=891783|mname=Middle Saxon baked clay loom weight|accessdate=1 June 2013}}</ref>  It is believed that an [[Anglo-Saxon]] church existed on the site of the current church of [[St Mary]].

The church attracts considerable attention because of its striking and unusual features, which include an original Norman doorway in the northern wall of the structure.<ref name=PS2/> It is thought that such a small village was provided with such an extravagant church because of the early residents of the area who included Countess Judith, niece of [[William the Conqueror]], and Sortibrand, the local Thane.\n\nThe current tower and spire of the church were erected between 1380 and 1410; however, the current bells (a ring of three) weren't installed until around 1540. Also during the 15th century an arch between the vestry and the chancel was made leading into a room with a chamber above it. Local tradition states that the upper chamber was inhabited by the parish priest and above the archway there still remains a small hole through which the priest could check to see if the lamp above the altar was still lit. A side chapel was once present at the church; however, this was later destroyed and its foundation wasn't rediscovered until the restoration of the church in 1887. The side chapel is thought to have been where masses were said for the souls of the dead.\n\nThe next major changes to the church came in the 16th century when the [[English Reformation]] occurred and many of the church's ornaments, including a [[rood screen]] and a number of smaller items, were removed or destroyed. However it was over this period, between 1530 and 1564, that the current church bells were installed in the spire. The most notable bell is \"Catherine\" which was installed prior to 1540 and bears the inscription \"Principio fine sonans sonus hic sit Caterine\" (May this sound of Catherine be sounding in the beginning (and) in the end.) The other two bells, which were installed later, bear the inscriptions \"Hope wel have w(e)l\" and \"CelorumXte placeat tibi rex sonus iste\" (\"O Christ, King of Heaven, may the sound please Thee\") respectively.\n\nThe Church contains a number of tombs of the Sherard family, who were influential in the area in the past, and also a helmet from a suit of armour thought to have belonged to the occupant of one of the tombs. The entirety of the suit of armour, or one similar to it, was present in the church well into the 20th century, however much of it was stolen by thieves.<ref name=PS2/><ref>{{NHLE|num=1360327|desc=Church of St. Mary |grade=I|accessdate=1 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nHannah Newton (born Hannah Ayscough), the mother of [[Isaac Newton]], married Barnabus Smith the Rector of the parish on Tuesday 27 January 1646 in his parish, and during the prohibited period for marriages.  She moved to the rectory, staying there until August 1653 when her seventy-one-year-old husband died. Isaac's two half-sisters and half-brother were baptized in the parish, and probably born there. Graffiti accredited to the young physicist can still be seen in several places in and around the church.\n\n===Modern history===\nA total of 25 men are listed as having Served in the [[First World War]] on the North Witham [[War memorial|Roll of Honour]], it is thought that this may have been around one quarter of the village's total population.  Four died in service, and 21 returned. A wall plaque to commemorate the dead was installed in the village church some time after the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|title= Memorial, North Witham WW1|url=https://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/62331|publisher=Imperial War Museum|accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nA similar Roll of Honour in the church records the service of local people in the [[Second World War]].

Following the end of World War II the airfield was closed, then used as an ammunition dump and test track for a time, before being donated to the [[Forestry Commission]] who still run the site under the name [[Twyford Wood]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RAF North Witham|url=http://www.bcar.org.uk/north-witham-history|publisher=Bomber County Aviation Resource|accessdate=1 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Twyford wood|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/englandlincolnshirekestevenforesttwyfordwood|publisher=Forestry Commission|accessdate=1 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nA Parish Council was traditionally responsible for local issues, however control was merged into the Parish council for [[Colsterworth]] in 2007 because of a lack of interest from villagers in North Witham itself.<ref name=merge/><ref name=plan/>  The North Witham Parish council had previously met in the village hall: a cricket pavilion from the nearby village of [[Great Ponton]] which was moved to North Witham in the early 1960s. Although effectively merged with Colsterworth, the 'civil parish'' has not been abolished and remains a separate legal entity.<ref name=merge/>\n\nAt district level the village falls into the Morkery ward of South Kesteven and is current represented at the district council by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Councillor Margery Radley.  North Witham falls into the Grantham and Stamford parliamentary constituency and is represented by [[Nick Boles]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\n== Education ==\nRecords suggest that a school existed in the village prior to 1857, however it wasn't until 1872 that a purpose built school building was constructed by [[Browne's Hospital, Stamford]]. In September 1874 the school is recorded to have had 24 pupils, however by 1936 this had dropped to 14. During 1941 a German bomber, thought to have been under the illusion that it was above the nearby town of Grantham, bombed North Witham and completely destroyed the school.<ref>{{cite web|title=Schools|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LIN/NorthWitham/#Schools|work=North Witham|publisher=GENUKI|accessdate=1 June 2013}}</ref>  The remaining pupils continued to have lessons inside the rectory in the village until May 1942 when the six pupils were given places at [[South Witham]] and Colsterworth schools. Today children of a primary school age continue to attend the schools in the nearby village, however older children have to travel to nearby towns such as Grantham and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] to continue their education.\n\n==Community==\nIn the past the parish contained two public houses, the Plough Inn and the Black Bull,<ref>{{NHLE|num=1168232|desc=The old Black Bull|grade=II|accessdate=1 June 2013}}</ref> however both were closed in the 20th century. A village shop was opened in the village hall during the 1980s, but closed after two years. A previous telephone box was removed by [[British Telecom]] in 2007 after it was vandalised; a post box from the reign of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] is still in place.\n\nA [[Camping and Caravanning Club]] certified{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} campsite is used by caravanners as a stopping-off point when using the nearby A1 road.<ref name=plan/>\n\nThe village is on the route of the No.28 bus between Grantham and South  Witham.<ref>{{cite web|title=Route 28|url=http://www.centrebus.info/Documents/28%20-%20Grantham%20-%20South%20Witham.pdf|work=Bus timetable|publisher=Centrebus|accessdate=2 June 2013}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Service 28|url=http://parishes.lincolnshire.gov.uk/Files/Parish/418/bus_timetable_2013.pdf|publisher=Lincolnshire county council|date=1 April 2013|accessdate=1 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:A view of North Witham, South Kesteven.png|A view of the newer area of the village, the majority of houses in the photo were constructed in the 1950s however three new terrace houses can be seen on the right.\nFile:North Witham2.png|The River Witham from the footbridge outside of North Witham, a ford can be seen in the foreground.\nFile:North Witham from the north side of the River Witham.png| North Witham from the south side of the River Witham which is visible in the foreground.

Megafauna outside of the African mainland (thus excluding [[#Madagascar|Madagascar]]), which did not evolve alongside humans, proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new [[predation]], and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the Earth (many [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|African species have also gone extinct in the Holocene]], but \u2013 with few exceptions \u2013 megafauna of the mainland was largely unaffected until a few hundred years ago).{{cn|date=January 2020}} These extinctions, occurring near the [[Pleistocene]]\u2013[[Holocene]] boundary, are sometimes referred to as the [[Quaternary extinction event]].\n\nThe most popular theory is that human overhunting of species added to existing stress conditions as the extinction coincides with human emergence. Although there is debate regarding how much human predation affected their decline, certain population declines have been directly correlated with human activity, such as the extinction events of [[List of extinct animals of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[List of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]]. Aside from humans, [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]] may have been a driving factor in the megafaunal extinctions, especially at the end of the Pleistocene.\n\nEcologically, humanity has been noted as an unprecedented \"global superpredator\"<ref name=\":4\"/> that consistently preys on the adults of other [[apex predator]]s, and has [[human impact on the environment|worldwide effect]]s on [[food web]]s. There have been extinctions of species on every [[land mass]] and in every [[ocean]]: there are many famous examples [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|within Africa]], [[List of Asian animals extinct in the Holocene|Asia]], [[List of extinct animals of Europe|Europe]], [[List of extinct animals of Australia|Australia]], [[List of North American animals extinct in the Holocene|North]] and [[List of South American animals extinct in the Holocene|South America]], and on smaller islands. Overall, the Holocene extinction can be linked to the [[human impact on the environment]].

Megafauna outside of the African mainland (thus excluding [[#Madagascar|Madagascar]]), which did not evolve alongside humans, proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new [[predation]], and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the Earth (many [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|African species have also gone extinct in the Holocene]], but \u2013 with few exceptions \u2013 megafauna of the mainland was largely unaffected until a few hundred years ago).{{cn|date=January 2020}} These extinctions, occurring near the [[Pleistocene]]\u2013[[Holocene]] boundary, are sometimes referred to as the [[Quaternary extinction event]].\n\nThe most popular theory is that human overhunting of species added to existing stress conditions as the extinction coincides with human emergence. Although there is debate regarding how much human predation affected their decline, certain population declines have been directly correlated with human activity, such as the extinction events of [[List of extinct animals of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[List of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]]. Aside from humans, [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]] may have been a driving factor in the megafaunal extinctions, especially at the end of the Pleistocene.\n\nEcologically, humanity has been noted as an unprecedented \"global superpredator\"<ref name=\":4\"/> that consistently preys on the adults of other [[apex predator]]s, and has [[human impact on the environment|worldwide effect]]s on [[food web]]s.

[[Katorga]], a category of punishment reserved for those convicted of the most serious crimes, had many of the features associated with labour-camp imprisonment: confinement, simplified facilities (as opposed to prisons), and forced labour, usually involving hard, unskilled or semi-skilled work. According to historian [[Anne Applebaum]], katorga was not a common sentence; approximately 6,000 [[katorga]] convicts were serving sentences in 1906 and 28,600 in 1916.<ref>Applebaum, Anne.

In the nineteenth century, the members of the failed [[Decembrist revolt]], [[Sybirak|Polish nobles who resisted Russian rule]], and members of various socialist revolutionary groups, including [[Bolsheviks]] such as [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]], [[Leon Trotsky]], and [[Joseph Stalin]] were all sent into exile.<ref>Applebaum, Anne.

In 1923 he was arrested for illegally crossing borders and smuggling. He was sentenced to 10 years' hard labor at [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]], which later came to be known as the \"first camp of the Gulag\". While serving his sentence he wrote a letter to the camp administration detailing a number of \"productivity improvement\" proposals including the infamous system of labor exploitation whereas the inmates' food rations were to be linked to their rate of production, a proposal known as nourishment scale (\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f). This notorious you-eat-as-you-work system would often kill weaker prisoners in weeks and caused countless casualties. The letter caught the attention of a number of high communist officials including [[Genrikh Yagoda]] and Frenkel soon went from being an inmate to becoming a camp commander and an important Gulag official. His proposals soon saw widespread adoption in the Gulag system <ref> Applebaum, Anne (2004). Gulag: a History of the Soviet Camps.

The growth of the camp system coincided with the peak of the Soviet [[industrialisation]] campaign. Most of the camps established to accommodate the masses of incoming prisoners were assigned distinct economic tasks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} These included the exploitation of natural resources and the colonisation of remote areas, as well as the realisation of enormous infrastructural facilities and industrial construction projects.

After Lenin's death in 1924, [[Stalin]] was able to take control of the government, and began to form the gulag system.  On June 27, 1929 the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] created a system of self-supporting camps that would eventually replace the existing prisons around the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=9}}</ref> These prisons were meant to receive inmates that received a prison sentence that exceeded three years.  Prisoners that had a shorter prison sentence than three years were to remain in the prison system that was still under the purview of the [[NKVD]].  The purpose of these new camps was to colonise the remote and inhospitable environments throughout the Soviet Union. These changes took place around the same time that Stalin started to institute collectivisation and rapid industrial development. [[Collectivisation in the Soviet Union|Collectivisation]] resulted in a large scale purge of peasants and so-called [[Kulaks]]. The Kulaks were supposedly wealthy (comparatively to other Soviet peasants) and were considered to be capitalists by the state, and by extension enemies of socialism. By late 1929 Stalin started a program known as \"[[dekulakization]]\". Stalin demanded that the kulak class be completely wiped out. This resulted in the imprisonment and execution of Soviet peasants. The term \"Kulak\" would also become associated with anyone who opposed or even seemed unsatisfied with the Soviet government. This resulted in 60,000 people being sent to the camps and another 154,000 exiled in a mere four months. This was only the beginning of the dekulakisation process. In 1931 alone 1,803,392 people were exiled.<ref>{{cite book|last1=khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=11}}</ref> Although these massive relocation processes were successful in getting a large potential free forced labour work force where they needed to be, that is about all it was successful at doing.  The \"special settlers\", as the Soviet government referred to them, all lived on starvation level rations, and many people starved to death in the camps, and anyone who was healthy enough to escape tried to do just that. This resulted in the government having to give rations to a group of people they were getting hardly any use out of, and was just costing the Soviet government money. The Unified State Political Administration (OGPU) quickly realised the problem, and began to reform the dekulakisation process. To help prevent the mass escapes the [[OGPU]] started to recruit people within the colony to help stop people who attempted to leave, and set up ambushes around known popular escape routes. The [[OGPU]] also attempted to raise the living conditions in these camps that would not encourage people to actively try and escape, and Kulaks were promised that they would regain their rights after five years. Even these revisions ultimately failed to resolve the problem, and the dekulakisation process was a failure in providing the government with a steady forced labour force. These prisoners were also lucky to be in the gulag in the early 1930s. Prisoners were relatively well off compared to what the prisoners would have to go through in the final years of the gulag.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=17}}</ref>\n\n=== During World War II ===\n\n==== Political role ====\n[[File:Kolyma road00.jpg|thumb|Road construction by inmates of the ''[[Dalstroy]]'' (part of the '[[R504 Kolyma Highway|Road of Bones]]' from Magadan to [[Yakutsk]])]]\n\nOn the eve of [[World War II]], Soviet archives indicate a combined camp and colony population upwards of 1.6 million in 1939, according to V.

They were initially intended for [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Nazi collaborators]], but then other categories of political prisoners (for example, members of [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported peoples]] who fled from exile) were also sentenced to \"katorga works\". Prisoners sentenced to \"katorga works\" were sent to Gulag prison camps with the most harsh regime and many of them perished.<ref name=\"gulag1\" />\n\n==== Economic role ====\n[[File:Political prisoners in Gulag.jpg|thumb|Political prisoners eating lunch in the [[Intalag]] coal mine]]\n[[File:Central shop in Norilsk in 1957.jpg|thumb|Central shop in [[Norilsk]] built by prisoners of the [[Norillag]]]]\n[[File:Logging at Small Ungut.jpeg|thumb|Lithuanian deportees preparing logs for rafting on the [[Mana River]]]]\nUp until World War II, the Gulag system expanded dramatically to create a Soviet \"camp economy\". Right before the war, forced labour provided 46.5% of the nation's [[nickel]], 76% of its [[tin]], 40% of its [[cobalt]], 40.5% of its chrome-iron ore, 60% of its gold, and 25.3% of its timber.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\"/>  And in preparation for war, the NKVD put up many more factories and built highways and railroads.\n\nThe Gulag quickly switched to production of arms and supplies for the army after fighting began. At first, transportation remained a priority. In 1940 the NKVD focused most of its energy on railroad construction.<ref name=khlev>{{cite book | last= Khevniuk | first= Oleg V.|title= The History of the Gulag: From Collectivization to the Great Terror|year= 2004|publisher= Yale University Press|pages= 236\u2013286}}</ref> This would prove extremely important when the German advance into the Soviet Union started in 1941. In addition, factories converted to produce ammunition, uniforms, and other supplies. Moreover, the NKVD gathered skilled workers and specialists from throughout the Gulag into 380 special colonies which produced tanks, aircraft, armaments, and ammunition.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\">{{cite book|last= Ivanova|first= Galina Mikhailovna|title= Labor Camp Socialism: The Gulag in the Soviet Totalitarian System|year= 2000|publisher= Sharpe|location= Armonk, NY|pages= 69\u2013126}}</ref>\n\nDespite its low capital costs, the camp economy suffered from serious flaws. For one, actual productivity almost never matched estimates: the estimates proved far too optimistic. In addition, scarcity of machinery and tools plagued the camps, and the tools that the camps did have quickly broke. The Eastern Siberian Trust of the Chief Administration of Camps for Highway Construction destroyed ninety-four trucks in just three years.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labour camps\" /> But the greatest problem was simple \u2013 forced labour was less efficient than free labour. In fact, prisoners in the Gulag were, on average, half as productive as free labourers in the USSR at the time,<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> which may be partially explained by malnutrition.\n\nTo make up for this disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners harder than ever. To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp administrator said in a meeting: \"There are cases when a prisoner is given only four or five hours out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly lowers his productivity.\" In the words of a former Gulag prisoner: \"By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to find people who were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead.\"<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military, and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942 the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.<ref name=ebacon>{{cite book|last= Bacon|first= Edwin|title= The Gulag at War: Stalin's Forced Labour System in the Light of the Archives|year= 1994|publisher= New York University Press|location= New York, NY|pages= 42\u201363, 82\u2013100, 123\u2013144}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to food shortages, the Gulag suffered from labour scarcity at the beginning of the war. The [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1936\u20131938 had provided a large supply of free labour, but by the start of World War II the purges had slowed down. In order to complete all of their [[project]]s, camp administrators moved prisoners from project to project.<ref name=khlev /> To improve the situation, laws were implemented in mid-1940 that allowed giving short camp sentences (4 months or a year) to those convicted of petty theft, hooliganism, or labour-discipline infractions. By January 1941 the Gulag workforce had increased by approximately 300,000 prisoners.<ref name=khlev /> But in 1942 serious food shortages began, and camp populations dropped again. The camps lost still more prisoners to the war effort. (The Soviet Union went into total war footing in June 1941.) Many labourers received early releases so that they could be drafted and sent to the front.<ref name=ebacon />\n\nEven as the pool of workers shrank, demand for outputs continued to grow rapidly. As a result, the Soviet government pushed the Gulag to \"do more with less\". With fewer able-bodied workers and few supplies from outside the camp system, camp administrators had to find a way to maintain production. The solution they found was to push the remaining prisoners still harder. The NKVD employed a system of setting unrealistically high production goals, straining resources in an attempt to encourage higher productivity. As the Axis armies pushed into Soviet territory from June 1941 on, labour resources became further strained, and many of the camps had to evacuate out of Western Russia. From the beginning of the war to halfway through 1944, 40 camps were set up, and 69 were disbanded. During evacuations, machinery received priority, leaving prisoners to reach safety on foot. The speed of [[Operation Barbarossa]]'s advance prevented the evacuation of all labourers in good time, and the NKVD [[NKVD prisoner massacres|massacred many to prevent them from falling into German hands]]. While this practice denied the Germans a source of free labour, it also further restricted the Gulag's capacity to keep up with the Red Army's demands. When the tide of the war turned, however, and the Soviets started pushing the Axis invaders back, fresh batches of labourers replenished the camps.

However, to one degree or another, the large majority of prisoners at most times faced meagre food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care. Most prisoners were compelled to perform harsh physical labour.<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 The Gulag Collection: Paintings of Nikolai Getman]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127121250/http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 |date=November 27, 2007 }}</ref> In most periods and economic branches, the degree of mechanisation of work processes was significantly lower than in the civilian industry: tools were often primitive and machinery, if existent, short in supply. Officially established work hours were in most periods longer and days off were fewer than for civilian workers.

Besides a wide array of punishments for prisoners refusing to work (which, in practice, were sometimes applied to prisoners that were too enfeebled to meet [[production quota]]), they instituted a number of positive incentives intended to boost productivity. These included monetary bonuses (since the early 1930s) and wage payments (from 1950 onward), cuts of individual sentences, general early-release schemes for norm fulfilment and overfulfilment (until 1939, again in selected camps from 1946 onward), preferential treatment, and privileges for the most productive workers ([[Udarnik|shock workers]] or [[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovites]] in Soviet parlance).<ref name=\"borodkin\">Leonid Borodkin and Simon Ertz 'Forced Labor and the Need for Motivation: Wages and Bonuses in the Stalinist Camp System', ''Comparative Economic Studies'', June 2005, Vol.47, Iss. 2, pp. 418\u2013436.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shack from Gulag - Museum of the Occupation of Latvia.JPG|thumb|Shack from Gulag \u2013 reconstruction in [[Museum of the Occupation of Latvia]]]]\n\nA distinctive incentive scheme that included both coercive and motivational elements and was applied universally in all camps consisted in standardised \"nourishment scales\": the size of the inmates' ration depended on the percentage of the work quota delivered. [[Naftaly Frenkel]] is credited for the introduction of this policy. While it was effective in compelling many prisoners to work harder, for many a prisoner it had the adverse effect, accelerating the exhaustion and sometimes causing the death of persons unable to fulfil high production quota.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 the conditions in camps worsened drastically: quotas were increased, rations cut, and medical supplies came close to none, all of which led to a sharp increase in mortality. The situation slowly improved in the final period and after the end of the war.\n\nConsidering the overall conditions and their influence on inmates, it is important to distinguish three major strata of Gulag inmates:\n\n*\"[[Kulak]]s\", [[osadnik]]s, \"[[ukaznik]]s\" (people sentenced for violation of various [[ukase]]s, such as [[Law of Spikelets]], decree about work discipline, etc.), occasional violators of [[criminal law]]\n*Dedicated criminals: \"[[thieves in law]]\"\n*People sentenced for various [[political prisoner|political]] and religious reasons.\n\n=== Gulag and famine (1932\u20131933) ===\nA severe [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1931\u20131933]] swept across many different regions in the Soviet Union. During this time, it is estimated that around six to seven million people starved to death.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=55}}</ref> On 7 August 1932, a new edict drafted by Stalin specified a minimum sentence of ten years or execution for theft from collective farms or of cooperative property. Over the next few months, prosecutions rose fourfold. A large share of cases prosecuted under the law were for the theft of small quantities of grain worth less than fifty rubles. The law was later relaxed on 8 May 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/archive/persa/010fulltext.pdf|title=Theft Under Stalin: A Property Rights Analysis|last=Gorlizki|first=Yoram|date=28 June 2001|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Overall, during the first half of 1933, prisons saw more new incoming inmates than the three previous years combined.\n\nPrisoners in the camps faced harsh working conditions. One Soviet report stated that, in early 1933, up to 15% of the prison population in [[Soviet Uzbekistan]] died monthly. During this time, prisoners were getting around {{convert|300|Cal|kJ}} worth of food a day. Many inmates attempted to flee, causing an upsurge in coercive and violent measures. Camps were directed \"not to spare bullets\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=61}}</ref> The bodies of inmates who tried to escape were commonly displayed in the courtyards of the camps, and the administrators would forcibly escort the inmates around the dead bodies as a message. Until 1934, lack of food and the outbreak of diseases started to destabilise the Gulag system. It wasn't until the famine ended that the system started to stabilize.\n\n=== Social conditions ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe convicts in such camps were actively involved in all kinds of labour with one of them being [[logging]] (''lesopoval''). The working territory of logging presented by itself a square and was surrounded by forest clearing. Thus, all attempts to exit or escape from it were well observed from the four towers set at each of its corners.\n\nLocals who captured a [[Fugitive|runaway]] were given rewards.<ref>\"[http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ Nikolai Getman: The Gulag Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513172402/http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ |date=May 13, 2012 }}\"</ref> It is also said that Gulags in colder areas were less concerned with finding escaped prisoners as they would die anyhow from the severely cold winters.

Remote monasteries in particular were frequently reused as sites for new camps. The site on the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the [[White Sea]] is one of the earliest and also most noteworthy, taking root soon after the Revolution in 1918.<ref name=\"Applebaum 2003\" /> The [[colloquial]] name for the islands, \"[[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]]\", entered the [[vernacular]] as a [[synonym]] for the labor camp in general. It was presented to the world as an example of the new Soviet method for \"re-education of [[class enemy|class enemies]]\" and reintegrating them through labor into Soviet society. Initially the inmates, largely Russian [[intelligentsia]], enjoyed relative freedom (within the natural confinement of the islands). Local newspapers and magazines were published and even some scientific research was carried out (e.g., a local botanical garden was maintained but unfortunately later lost completely). Eventually Solovki turned into an ordinary Gulag camp; in fact some historians maintain that it was a pilot camp of this type. In 1929 [[Maxim Gorky]] visited the camp and published an apology for it. The report of Gorky's trip to Solovki was included in the cycle of impressions titled \"Po Soiuzu Sovetov,\" Part V, subtitled \"Solovki.\" In the report, Gorky wrote that \"camps such as 'Solovki' were absolutely necessary.\"<ref name=Yedlin>{{cite book|last=Yedlin|first=Tova|title=Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96605-8|page=188 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zxt5_vI_ozcC&pg=PA188}}</ref>\n\nWith the new emphasis on Gulag as the means of concentrating cheap labour, new camps were then constructed throughout the Soviet sphere of influence, wherever the economic task at hand dictated their existence (or was designed specifically to avail itself of them, such as the [[White Sea-Baltic Canal]] or the [[Baikal Amur Mainline]]), including facilities in big cities \u2014 parts of the famous [[Moscow Metro]] and the [[Moscow State University]] new campus were built by forced labor. Many more projects during the rapid industrialisation of the 1930s, [[World War II|war-time]] and post-war periods were fulfilled on the backs of convicts. The activity of Gulag camps spanned a wide cross-section of Soviet industry. Gorky organised in 1933 a trip of 120 writers and artists to the White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal, 36 of them wrote a propaganda book about the construction published in 1934 and destroyed in 1937.\n\n[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Genrikh Yagoda]] (middle) inspecting the construction of the [[Moscow Canal|Moscow-Volga canal]].

However, camps were generally spread throughout the entire [[Soviet Union]], including the European parts of [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. There were several camps outside the Soviet Union, in [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Mongolia]], which were under the direct control of the Gulag.\n\nNot all camps were fortified; some in Siberia were marked only by posts. Escape was deterred by the harsh elements, as well as tracking dogs that were assigned to each camp. While during the 1920s and 1930s native tribes often aided escapees, many of the tribes were also [[victimised]] by escaped thieves. Tantalised by large rewards as well, they began aiding authorities in the capture of Gulag inmates. Camp guards were given stern incentive to keep their inmates in line at all costs; if a prisoner escaped under a guard's watch, the guard would often be stripped of his uniform and become a Gulag inmate himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Further, if an escaping prisoner was shot, guards could be fined amounts that were often equivalent to one or two weeks wages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n[[File:Ru200008020027.jpg|thumb|upright|Part of 'Project 503' to build a railroad from [[Salekhard]] to [[Igarka]] near [[Turukhansk]] on the [[Yenisey]]]]\n\nIn some cases, teams of inmates were dropped off in new territory with a limited supply of resources and left to set up a new camp or die. Sometimes it took several waves of colonists before any one group survived to establish the camp.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe area along the [[Indigirka river]] was known as ''the Gulag inside the Gulag''.

It would be virtually impossible to reflect the entire mass of Gulag facilities on a map that would also account for the various times of their existence.<ref name=\"Ivanova 2000\" /></blockquote>\n\nSince many of these existed only for short periods, the number of camp administrations at any given point was lower. It peaked in the early 1950s, when there were more than 100 camp administrations across the Soviet Union.

The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the 'moral explanation'. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on the darker side of human nature \u2013 providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. Another approach is the 'political explanation', according to which the Gulag (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime's perceived political enemies (this understanding is favoured by historian Robert Conquest, amongst others). The 'economic explanation', in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalised the Gulag for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin's death in 1953. Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates the Gulag in the context of modern projects of 'cleansing' the social body of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Death and Redemption: The Gulag and the Shaping of Soviet Society|last=Barnes|first=Stephen A.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-691-15112-0|location=Princeton|pages=7\u201316|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Hannah Arendt]] argued that as part of a [[totalitarian]] system of government, the camps of the Gulag system were experiments in \"total domination.\" In her view, the goal of a totalitarian system was not merely to establish limits on liberty, but rather to abolish liberty entirely in service of its ideology. She argues that the Gulag system was not merely political repression because the system survived and grew long after Stalin had wiped out all serious political resistance. Although the various camps were initially filled with criminals and political prisoners, eventually they were filled with prisoners who were arrested irrespective of anything relating to them as individuals, but rather only on the basis of their membership in some ever shifting category of imagined threats to the state.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 437 \u2013 59</ref>\n\nShe also argues that the function of the Gulag system was not truly economic. Although the Soviet government deemed them all \"forced labour\" camps, this in fact highlighted that the work in the camps was deliberately pointless, since all Russian workers could be subject to forced labour.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 444 \u2013 45</ref> The only real economic purpose they typically served was financing the cost of their own supervision. Otherwise the work performed was generally useless, either by design or made that way through extremely poor planning and execution; some workers even preferred more difficult work if it was actually productive. She differentiated between \"authentic\" forced-labour camps, concentration camps, and \"annihilation camps\". In authentic labour camps, inmates worked in \"relative freedom and are sentenced for limited periods.\" Concentration camps had extremely high mortality rates and but were still \"essentially organised for labour purposes.\" Annihilation camps were those where the inmates were \"systematically wiped out through starvation and neglect.\" She criticises other commentators' conclusion that the purpose of the camps was a supply of cheap labour. According to her, the Soviets were able to liquidate the camp system without serious economic consequences, showing that the camps were not an important source of labour and were overall economically irrelevant.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nArendt argues that together with the systematised, arbitrary cruelty inside the camps, this served the purpose of total domination by eliminating the idea that the arrestees had any political or legal rights. Morality was destroyed by maximising cruelty and by organising the camps internally to make the inmates and guards complicit. The terror resulting from operation of the Gulag system caused people outside of the camps to cut all ties with anyone who was arrested or purged and to avoid forming ties with others for fear of being associated with anyone who was targeted. As a result, the camps were essential as the nucleus of a system that destroyed individuality and dissolved all social bonds.

On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The decrement in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree of reliability of the reports.<ref name=\"\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438\">{{cite journal|last=\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440|title=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 (1917\u20131990 \u0433\u0433.).|journal=\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f XXI|year=1994|issue=\u2116 1\u20132|pages=107\u2013124|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330205748/http://kob.rv.ua/doki-dai/dotu/other/zemskov/zemskov_politrepressii(1917-1990).pdf |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, the first precise statistical data on the Gulag based on the Gulag archives were published by [[Viktor Zemskov]].<ref name=\"Rousso, Golsan\">{{cite book|last1=Rousso|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Rousso|last2=Golsan|first2=Richard|title=Stalinism and nazism: history and memory compared|year=2004|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-9000-6|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CIt7fMp30sAC&printsec=frontcover#PPA92,M1}}</ref> These had been generally accepted by leading Western scholars,<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /><ref name=Ellman_SRS />  despite the fact that a number of inconsistencies were found in this statistics.<ref name= Vishnevsky /> It is also necessary to note that not all the conclusions drawn by Zemskov based on his data have been generally accepted. Thus, Sergei Maksudov alleged that although literary sources, for example the books of [[Lev Razgon]] or [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], did not envisage the total number of the camps very well and markedly exaggerated their size, on the other hand, Viktor Zemskov, who published many documents by the NKVD and [[KGB]], was far from understanding of the Gulag essence and the nature of socio-political processes in the country. He added that without distinguishing the degree of accuracy and reliability of certain figures, without making a critical analysis of sources, without comparing new data with already known information, Zemskov absolutises the published materials by presenting them as the ultimate truth. As a result, Maksudov charges that Zemskov attempts to make generalized statements with reference to a particular document, as a rule, do not hold water.<ref name=\"\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\">{{cite journal|last=\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432|first=\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439|title=\u041e \u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u0432 \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435 \"\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0441\"|journal=\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f|year=1995|issue=\u2116 9|pages=114\u2013118|url=http://scepsis.ru/library/id_956.html|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Frenkel2.jpg|thumb|[[OGPU]] chiefs responsible for construction of the [[White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal]]: right: [[Naftaly Frenkel|Frenkel]]; center: [[Matvei Berman|Berman]]; left: Afanasev (Head of the southern part of BelBaltLag)]]\n\nIn response, Zemskov wrote that the charge that Zemskov allegedly did not compare new data with already known information could not be called fair. In his words, the trouble with most western writers is that they do not benefit from such comparisons. Zemskov added that when he tried not to overuse the juxtaposition of new information with \"old\" one, it was only because of a sense of delicacy, not to once again psychologically traumatise the researchers whose works used incorrect figures, as it turned out after the publication of the statistics by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD.<ref name=\"\u041a \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0443\" />\n\nAccording to French historian [[Nicolas Werth]], the mountains of the materials of the Gulag archives, which are stored in funds of the [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]] and are being constantly exposed during the last fifteen years, represent only a very small part of bureaucratic prose of immense size left over the decades of \"creativity\" by the \"dull and reptile\" organisation managing the Gulag.

As a rule, they were situated in remote parts of the USSR, and labour conditions were extremely hard there. They formed a core of the GULAG system. The inmates of \"corrective labour colonies\" served shorter terms; these colonies were located in less remote parts of the USSR, and they were run by local NKVD administration.<ref name=\"GRZ\" /> Preliminary analysis of the GULAG camps and colonies statistics (see the chart on the right) demonstrated that the population reached the maximum before the World War II, then dropped sharply, partially due to massive releases, partially due to wartime high mortality, and then was gradually increasing until the end of Stalin era, reaching the global maximum in 1953, when the combined population of GULAG camps and labour colonies amounted to 2,625,000.<ref name=\"Anatoly Vishnevsky\">[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema05.php \"The Total Number of Repressed\"], by [[Anatoly Vishnevsky]], Director of the Center for Human Demography and Ecology, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nThe results of these archival studies convinced many scholars, including [[Robert Conquest]]<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> or Stephen Wheatcroft to reconsider their earlier estimates of the size of the GULAG population, although the 'high numbers' of arrested and deaths are not radically different from earlier estimates.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Although such scholars as Rosefielde or Vishnevsky point at several inconsistencies in archival data with Rosefielde pointing out the archival figure of 1,196,369 for the population of the Gulag and labor colonies combined on December 31, 1936 is less than half the 2.75 million labor camp population given to the Census Board by the NKVD for the 1937 census,<ref>http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/rosefielde.pdf</ref><ref name= Vishnevsky>Vishnevsky, Alantoly. \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439 (The Demographic Loss of Repression), Demoscope Weekly, December 31, 2007, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema06.php retrieved] April 13, 2011</ref> it is generally believed that these data provide more reliable and detailed information that the indirect data and literary sources available for the scholars during the Cold War era.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> Although Conquest cited Beria's report to the Politburo of the labor camp numbers at the end of 1938 stating there were almost 7 million prisoners in the labor camps, more than three times the archival figure for 1938 and an official report to Stalin by the Soviet minister of State Security in 1952 stating there were 12 million prisoners in the labor camps.<ref>https://www.bu.edu/iscip/pubseries/PubSeries1conquest.pdf</ref>\n\nThese data allowed scholars to conclude that during the period of 1928\u201353, about 14 million prisoners passed through the system of GULAG ''labour camps'' and 4\u20135 million passed through the ''labour colonies''.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Thus, these figures reflect the number of convicted persons, and do not take into account the fact that a significant part of Gulag inmates had been convicted more than one time, so the actual number of convicted is somewhat overstated by these statistics.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> From other hand, during some periods of Gulag history the official figures of GULAG population reflected the camps' capacity, not the actual number of inmates, so the actual figures were 15% higher in, e.g. 1946.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" />\n\n== Influence ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\n\n=== Culture ===\n<!-- this section is for the general influence on the Soviet culture of **Gulag itself**, not a list of publications about Gulag -->\n\nThe Gulag spanned nearly four decades of Soviet and East European history and affected millions of individuals. Its cultural impact was enormous.\n\nThe Gulag has become a major influence on contemporary Russian thinking, and an important part of modern [[Russian folklore]].  Many songs by the authors-performers known as the [[Bard (Soviet Union)|''bards'']], most notably [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]], neither of whom ever served time in the camps, describe life inside the Gulag and glorified the life of \"Zeks\". Words and phrases which originated in the labor camps became part of the Russian/Soviet vernacular in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe memoirs of [[Alexander Dolgun]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Varlam Shalamov]] and [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]], among others, became a symbol of defiance in Soviet society.  These writings harshly chastised the Soviet people for their tolerance and apathy regarding the Gulag, but at the same time provided a testament to the courage and resolve of those who were imprisoned.\n\nAnother cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union linked with the Gulag was the forced migration of many artists and other people of culture to Siberia. This resulted in a Renaissance of sorts in places like [[Magadan]], where, for example, the quality of theatre production was comparable to [[Moscow]]'s and [[Eddie Rosner]] played jazz.\n\n==== Literature ====\nMany eyewitness accounts of Gulag prisoners have been published:\n[[File:1929-ShalamovV.jpg|thumb|[[Varlam Shalamov]] after first arrest, 1929]]\n* [[Varlam Shalamov]]'s ''[[The Kolyma Tales|Kolyma Tales]]'' is a short-story collection, cited by most major works on the Gulag, and widely considered one of the main Soviet accounts.\n* [[Victor Kravchenko (defector)|Victor Kravchenko]] wrote ''[[I Chose Freedom (book)|I Chose Freedom]]'' after defecting to the [[United States]] in 1944. As a leader of industrial plants he had encountered forced labour camps in across the Soviet Union from 1935 to 1941. He describes a visit to one camp at [[Kemerovo]] on the [[Tom River]] in Siberia. Factories paid a fixed sum to the [[KGB]] for every convict they employed.\n* [[Anatoli Granovsky]] wrote ''I Was an NKVD Agent'' after [[Defection|defecting]] to [[Sweden]] in 1946 and included his experiences seeing gulag prisoners as a young boy, as well as his experiences as a prisoner himself in 1939. Granovsky's father was sent to the gulag in 1937.\n* [[Julius Margolin]]'s book ''A Travel to the Land Ze-Ka'' was finished in 1947, but it was impossible to publish such a book about the Soviet Union at the time, immediately after World War II.\n* [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]] wrote ''A World Apart'', which was translated into English by Andrzej Ciolkosz and published with an introduction by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1951. By describing life in the gulag in a harrowing personal account, it provides an in-depth, original analysis of the nature of the Soviet communist system.\n* [[Victor Herman]]'s book ''Coming out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life''. Herman experienced firsthand many places, prisons, and experiences that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was able to reference in only passing or through brief second hand accounts.\n* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' was not the first literary work about labour camps. His previous book on the subject, \"[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]\", about a typical day in the life of a Gulag inmate, was originally published in the most prestigious Soviet monthly, ''[[Novy Mir]]'' (''New World''), in November 1962, but was soon banned and withdrawn from all libraries. It was the first work to demonstrate the Gulag as an instrument of governmental repression against its own citizens on a massive scale. ''[[The First Circle]]'', an account of three days in the lives of prisoners in the ''[[Marfino]]'' ''[[sharashka]]'' or special prison was submitted for publication to the Soviet authorities shortly after ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' but was rejected and later published abroad in 1968.\n* [[Slavomir Rawicz]]'s book \"[[The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom]]\": In 1941, the author and six other fellow prisoners escaped a Soviet labour camp in Yakutsk\u2014a camp where enduring hunger, cold, untended wounds, untreated illnesses, and avoiding daily executions were everyday horrors. \n* [[J\u00e1nos R\u00f3zs\u00e1s]], a Hungarian writer, often referred to as the Hungarian Solzhenitsyn,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.raptisrarebooks.com/product/one-day-in-the-life-of-ivan-denisovich-inscribed-first-edition-alexander-solzhenitsyn-signed/ | title=One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich}}</ref> wrote many books and articles on the issue of the Gulag.\n*[[Zoltan Szalkai]], a Hungarian documentary filmmaker, made several films about gulag camps.\n* [[Karlo \u0160tajner]], a Croatian communist who was active in the former [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the manager of the [[Comintern Publishing House]] in Moscow 1932\u201339, was arrested one night and taken from his Moscow home after being accused of anti-revolutionary activities. He spent the next 20 years in camps from Solovki to Norilsk. After USSR\u2013[[Yugoslavia]]n political normalization he was re-tried and quickly found innocent. He left the Soviet Union with his wife, who had been waiting for him for 20 years, in 1956 and spent the rest of his life in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. He wrote an impressive book titled ''7000 days in Siberia''.\n* ''Dancing Under the Red Star'' by [[Karl Tobien]] ({{ISBN|1-4000-7078-3}}) tells the story of Margaret Werner, an athletic girl who moves to Russia right before the start of Stalin's terror. She faces many hardships, as her father is taken away from her and imprisoned. Werner is the only American woman who survived the Gulag to tell about it.\n* ''Alexander Dolgun's Story: An American in the Gulag'' ({{ISBN|0-394-49497-0}}), by a member of the US Embassy, and ''I Was a Slave in Russia'' ({{ISBN|0-8159-5800-5}}), an American factory owner's son, were two more American citizens interned who wrote of their ordeal. They were interned due to their American citizenship for about eight years c. 1946\u201355.\n* [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]] wrote two famous books about her remembrances, ''Journey Into the Whirlwind'' and ''Within the Whirlwind''.\n*[[Savi\u0107 Markovi\u0107 \u0160tedimlija]], a pro-[[Croatia]]n Montenegrin ideologist. Caught in [[Austria]] by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, he was sent to the USSR and spent ten years in the Gulag. After his release, Markovi\u0107 wrote his autobiographical account in two volumes titled ''Ten years in Gulag'' (''Deset godina u Gulagu'', Matica crnogorska, Podgorica, Montenegro 2004).\n* [[Ani\u021ba Nandri\u0219-Cudla]]'s book, ''20 Years in Siberia [20 de ani \u00een Siberia]'' is the own life's account written by a Romanian peasant woman from Bucovina (Mahala village near Cern\u0103u\u021bi) who managed to survive the harsh, forced labour system together with her three sons.  Together with her husband and her three underage children, she was deported from Mahala village to the Soviet  Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, at the Polar Circle, without a trial or even a communicated accusation. The same night of June 12 to 13, 1941, (that is before the breakout of the Second World War), overall 602 fellow villagers were arrested and deported, without any prior notice. Her mother received the same sentence but was spared from deportation after the fact that she was a paraplegic was acknowledged by the authorities.  It was later discovered that the reason for her deportation and forced labour was the fake and nonsensical claim that, allegedly, her husband had been a mayor in the Romanian administration, a politician and a rich peasant, none of the latter of which was true. Separated from her husband, she brought up the three boys, overcame  [[typhus]], [[scorbutus]], [[malnutrition]], extreme cold and harsh toils, to later return to Bucovina after rehabilitation. Her manuscript was written toward the end of her life, in the simple and direct language of a peasant with three years of public school education, and was secretly brought to Romania before the fall of Romanian communism, in 1982. Her manuscript was first published in 1991. Her deportation was shared mainly with Romanians from Bucovina and Basarabia, Finnish and Polish prisoners, as token proof to show that Gulag labour camps had also been used for the shattering/ extermination of the natives in the newly occupied territories of the Soviet Union.\n* [[Frantsishak Alyakhnovich]] \u2013 Solovki prisoner\n* [[Blagoy Popov]], a Bulgarian communist and a defendant in the [[Leipzig trial]], along with [[Georgi Dimitrov]] and [[Vasil Tanev]], was arrested in 1937 during the [[Stalinist purges]] and spent seventeen years in [[Norillag]]. Popov was released in 1954, after the death of Stalin, and returned to [[Bulgaria]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438|last=\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432|first=\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0439|publisher=\u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \"\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\"|year=2012|isbn=978-619-152-025-1|location=\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f|pages=37, 57}}</ref> He wrote his autobiographical account in the book ''From the Leipzig trial to the Siberia camps'' (''\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438'', \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, 2012 {{ISBN|978-619-152-025-1}}).\n* [[Mkrtich Armen]], an Armenian writer who was imprisoned in 1937 and rehabilitated in 1945, published a collection of his memories under the title \"They Ordered to Give You\" in 1964.\n* [[Gurgen Mahari]], an Armenian writer and poet, who was arrested in 1936, released in 1947, arrested again in 1948 and sent into Siberian exile as an \"unreliable type\" until 1954, wrote \"Barbed Wires in Blossom\", a novella based largely on his personal experiences in a Soviet gulag.\n\n=== Colonisation ===\n[[File:Vorkuta r.jpg|thumb|The city of [[Vorkuta]]]]\nSoviet [[wikisource:\u041e\u0431 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445|state documents]] show that the goals of the gulag included colonisation of sparsely populated remote areas.

In addition, for persons who served full term, but who were denied the free choice of place of residence, it was recommended to assign them for \"free settlement\" and give them land in the general vicinity of the place of confinement.\n\nThe gulag inherited this approach from the [[katorga]] system.\n\nIt is estimated that of the 40,000 people collecting state pensions in [[Vorkuta Gulag|Vorkuta]], 32,000 are trapped former gulag inmates, or their descendants.<ref>Robert Conquest, Paul Hollander: Political violence: belief, behavior, and legitimation p.55, Palgrave Macmillan;(2008) {{ISBN|978-0-230-60646-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Life after term served ===\nPersons who served a term in a camp or in a prison were restricted from taking a wide range of jobs.

According to historian [[Anne Applebaum]], katorga was not a common sentence; approximately 6,000 [[katorga]] convicts were serving sentences in 1906 and 28,600 in 1916.<ref>Applebaum, Anne. ''Gulag: A History.''

''Origins of the Gulag''. E-book, The University Press of Kentucky, 2015, pp. 11</ref> Forced exile to [[Siberia]] had been in use since the seventeenth century for a wide range of offenses and was a common punishment for political dissidents and revolutionaries. In the nineteenth century, the members of the failed [[Decembrist revolt]], [[Sybirak|Polish nobles who resisted Russian rule]], and members of various socialist revolutionary groups, including [[Bolsheviks]] such as [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]], [[Leon Trotsky]], and [[Joseph Stalin]] were all sent into exile.<ref>Applebaum, Anne. ''Gulag: A History.'' Anchor, 2004, pp. xxix-xxx</ref> Convicts serving labour sentences and exiles were sent to the underpopulated areas of Siberia and the [[Russian Far East]] \u2013 regions that had few towns or food sources and lacked any organised transportation systems. Despite the isolated conditions, there were prisoners who successfully escaped to populated areas. Stalin himself escaped three of the four times he was sent into exile.<ref>Applebaum, Anne. ''Gulag: A History.'' Anchor, 2004, pp. xxxiii</ref> From these times, Siberia gained its fearful connotation of punishment, which was further enhanced by the Soviet GULAG system. The Bolsheviks' own experiences with exile and forced labour provided them with a model on which to base their system, including the importance of strict enforcement.\n\nDuring 1920\u201350, the leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet state considered repression to be a tool that was to be used for securing the normal functioning of the Soviet state system, as well as for preserving and strengthening the positions within their social base, the working class (when the Bolsheviks took power, peasants represented 80% of the population).<ref name=\"\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\">{{cite journal|last=\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440|title=\u0413\u0423\u041b\u0410\u0413 (\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442)|journal=\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f|year=1991|issue=\u2116 6,7|url=http://scepsis.ru/library/id_937.html|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}</ref> In the midst of the [[Russian Civil War]], Lenin and the Bolsheviks established a \"special\" prison camp system, separate from its traditional prison system and under the control of the [[Cheka]].<ref>Applebaum, Anne. \"Gulag: A History.\" Anchor, 2003, pp. 12</ref> These camps, as Lenin envisioned them, had a distinctly political purpose.<ref>=Applebaum, Anne. \"Gulag: A History.\" Anchor, 2003, pp. 5</ref> These early camps of the GULAG system were introduced in order to isolate and eliminate class-alien, socially dangerous, disruptive, suspicious, and other disloyal elements, whose deeds and thoughts were not contributing to the strengthening of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].<ref name=\"\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\" /> Forced labour as a \"method of reeducation\" was applied in [[Solovki prison camp]] as early as the 1920s,<ref name=\"ApplebaumChapter3\">Applebaum, \"Gulag: A History\", Chapter 3</ref> based on [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'s experiments with forced labour camps for Czech war prisoners from 1918 and his proposals to introduce \"compulsory labor service\" voiced in ''[[Terrorism and Communism]]''.<ref name=\"ApplebaumChapter3\" /><ref>\"The only way to attract the labor power necessary for our economic problems is to introduce compulsory labour service\", in: {{cite web|title = Leon Trotsky: Terrorism and Communism (Chapter 8)|url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1920/terrcomm/ch08.htm|website = www.marxists.org|accessdate = August 6, 2015|first = Leon|last = Trotsky}}</ref> Various categories of prisoners were defined: petty criminals, POWs of the [[Russian Civil War]], officials accused of corruption, sabotage and embezzlement, political enemies, dissidents and other people deemed dangerous for the state.

The \"traditional\" judicial and prison system, which dealt with criminal prisoners, were first overseen by The People's Commissariat of Justice until 1922, after which they were overseen by the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, also known as the [[NKVD]]<ref>Jakobson, Michael.

In 1923 he was arrested for illegally crossing borders and smuggling. He was sentenced to 10 years' hard labor at [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]], which later came to be known as the \"first camp of the Gulag\". While serving his sentence he wrote a letter to the camp administration detailing a number of \"productivity improvement\" proposals including the infamous system of labor exploitation whereas the inmates' food rations were to be linked to their rate of production, a proposal known as nourishment scale (\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f). This notorious you-eat-as-you-work system would often kill weaker prisoners in weeks and caused countless casualties. The letter caught the attention of a number of high communist officials including [[Genrikh Yagoda]] and Frenkel soon went from being an inmate to becoming a camp commander and an important Gulag official. His proposals soon saw widespread adoption in the Gulag system <ref> Applebaum, Anne (2004). Gulag: a History of the Soviet Camps.

Hence it is followed by one more important reason for the constancy of the repressive policy, namely, the state's interest in unremitting rates of receiving a cheap labour force that was forcibly used, mainly in the extreme conditions of the east and north.<ref name=\"\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\" /> The Gulag possessed both punitive and economic functions.<ref name=\"Ellman\">{{cite journal|last=Ellman|first=Michael|title=Soviet Repression Statistics: Some Comments|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|year=2002|volume=54|issue=2|pages=1151\u20131172|url=http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/ELM-Repression_Statistics.pdf|accessdate=August 14, 2011|doi=10.1080/0966813022000017177}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation and expansion under Stalin ===\n\nThe Gulag was officially established on April 25, 1930 as the ULAG by the OGPU order 130/63 in accordance with the Sovnarkom order 22 p.&nbsp;248 dated April 7, 1930.

The growth of the camp system coincided with the peak of the Soviet [[industrialisation]] campaign. Most of the camps established to accommodate the masses of incoming prisoners were assigned distinct economic tasks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} These included the exploitation of natural resources and the colonisation of remote areas, as well as the realisation of enormous infrastructural facilities and industrial construction projects. The plan to achieve these goals with \"[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlements]]\" instead of labor camps was dropped after the revealing of the [[Nazino affair]] in 1933; subsequently the Gulag system was expanded.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nThe 1931\u201332 archives indicate the Gulag had approximately 200,000 prisoners in the camps; while in 1935, approximately 800,000 were in camps and 300,000 in colonies (annual averages).<ref name=Kozlov />\n\n[[File:Korolev posle aresta 1938.jpg|thumb|right|Rocket engineer [[Sergei Korolev]] shortly after his arrest in 1938]]\nIn the early 1930s, a tightening of Soviet penal policy caused significant growth of the prison camp population.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HYSGZs6mW5wC|title=Gulag: A History of the Soviet Camps|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|date=2012-08-02|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780141975269|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=The Camps Expand}}</ref> During the [[Great Purge]] of 1937\u201338, mass arrests caused another increase in inmate numbers.

After Lenin's death in 1924, [[Stalin]] was able to take control of the government, and began to form the gulag system.  On June 27, 1929 the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] created a system of self-supporting camps that would eventually replace the existing prisons around the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=9}}</ref> These prisons were meant to receive inmates that received a prison sentence that exceeded three years.  Prisoners that had a shorter prison sentence than three years were to remain in the prison system that was still under the purview of the [[NKVD]].  The purpose of these new camps was to colonise the remote and inhospitable environments throughout the Soviet Union. These changes took place around the same time that Stalin started to institute collectivisation and rapid industrial development. [[Collectivisation in the Soviet Union|Collectivisation]] resulted in a large scale purge of peasants and so-called [[Kulaks]]. The Kulaks were supposedly wealthy (comparatively to other Soviet peasants) and were considered to be capitalists by the state, and by extension enemies of socialism. By late 1929 Stalin started a program known as \"[[dekulakization]]\". Stalin demanded that the kulak class be completely wiped out. This resulted in the imprisonment and execution of Soviet peasants. The term \"Kulak\" would also become associated with anyone who opposed or even seemed unsatisfied with the Soviet government. This resulted in 60,000 people being sent to the camps and another 154,000 exiled in a mere four months. This was only the beginning of the dekulakisation process. In 1931 alone 1,803,392 people were exiled.<ref>{{cite book|last1=khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=11}}</ref> Although these massive relocation processes were successful in getting a large potential free forced labour work force where they needed to be, that is about all it was successful at doing.  The \"special settlers\", as the Soviet government referred to them, all lived on starvation level rations, and many people starved to death in the camps, and anyone who was healthy enough to escape tried to do just that. This resulted in the government having to give rations to a group of people they were getting hardly any use out of, and was just costing the Soviet government money. The Unified State Political Administration (OGPU) quickly realised the problem, and began to reform the dekulakisation process. To help prevent the mass escapes the [[OGPU]] started to recruit people within the colony to help stop people who attempted to leave, and set up ambushes around known popular escape routes. The [[OGPU]] also attempted to raise the living conditions in these camps that would not encourage people to actively try and escape, and Kulaks were promised that they would regain their rights after five years. Even these revisions ultimately failed to resolve the problem, and the dekulakisation process was a failure in providing the government with a steady forced labour force. These prisoners were also lucky to be in the gulag in the early 1930s. Prisoners were relatively well off compared to what the prisoners would have to go through in the final years of the gulag.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=17}}</ref>\n\n=== During World War II ===\n\n==== Political role ====\n[[File:Kolyma road00.jpg|thumb|Road construction by inmates of the ''[[Dalstroy]]'' (part of the '[[R504 Kolyma Highway|Road of Bones]]' from Magadan to [[Yakutsk]])]]\n\nOn the eve of [[World War II]], Soviet archives indicate a combined camp and colony population upwards of 1.6 million in 1939, according to V.

For one, actual productivity almost never matched estimates: the estimates proved far too optimistic. In addition, scarcity of machinery and tools plagued the camps, and the tools that the camps did have quickly broke. The Eastern Siberian Trust of the Chief Administration of Camps for Highway Construction destroyed ninety-four trucks in just three years.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labour camps\" /> But the greatest problem was simple \u2013 forced labour was less efficient than free labour. In fact, prisoners in the Gulag were, on average, half as productive as free labourers in the USSR at the time,<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> which may be partially explained by malnutrition.\n\nTo make up for this disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners harder than ever. To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp administrator said in a meeting: \"There are cases when a prisoner is given only four or five hours out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly lowers his productivity.\" In the words of a former Gulag prisoner: \"By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to find people who were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead.\"<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military, and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942 the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.<ref name=ebacon>{{cite book|last= Bacon|first= Edwin|title= The Gulag at War: Stalin's Forced Labour System in the Light of the Archives|year= 1994|publisher= New York University Press|location= New York, NY|pages= 42\u201363, 82\u2013100, 123\u2013144}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to food shortages, the Gulag suffered from labour scarcity at the beginning of the war. The [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1936\u20131938 had provided a large supply of free labour, but by the start of World War II the purges had slowed down. In order to complete all of their [[project]]s, camp administrators moved prisoners from project to project.<ref name=khlev /> To improve the situation, laws were implemented in mid-1940 that allowed giving short camp sentences (4 months or a year) to those convicted of petty theft, hooliganism, or labour-discipline infractions. By January 1941 the Gulag workforce had increased by approximately 300,000 prisoners.<ref name=khlev /> But in 1942 serious food shortages began, and camp populations dropped again. The camps lost still more prisoners to the war effort. (The Soviet Union went into total war footing in June 1941.) Many labourers received early releases so that they could be drafted and sent to the front.<ref name=ebacon />\n\nEven as the pool of workers shrank, demand for outputs continued to grow rapidly. As a result, the Soviet government pushed the Gulag to \"do more with less\". With fewer able-bodied workers and few supplies from outside the camp system, camp administrators had to find a way to maintain production. The solution they found was to push the remaining prisoners still harder. The NKVD employed a system of setting unrealistically high production goals, straining resources in an attempt to encourage higher productivity. As the Axis armies pushed into Soviet territory from June 1941 on, labour resources became further strained, and many of the camps had to evacuate out of Western Russia. From the beginning of the war to halfway through 1944, 40 camps were set up, and 69 were disbanded. During evacuations, machinery received priority, leaving prisoners to reach safety on foot. The speed of [[Operation Barbarossa]]'s advance prevented the evacuation of all labourers in good time, and the NKVD [[NKVD prisoner massacres|massacred many to prevent them from falling into German hands]]. While this practice denied the Germans a source of free labour, it also further restricted the Gulag's capacity to keep up with the Red Army's demands. When the tide of the war turned, however, and the Soviets started pushing the Axis invaders back, fresh batches of labourers replenished the camps. As the Red Army recaptured territories from the Germans, an influx of Soviet ex-POWs greatly increased the Gulag population.<ref name=ebacon />\n\n=== After World War II ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Labor camp.jpg|thumb|Upper Debin Camp, painted by former prisoner [[Nikolai Getman]]]] -->\n[[File:Transpolar Railway between Salekhard and Nadym.jpg|thumb| The [[Salekhard\u2013Igarka Railway|Transpolar Railway]] was a project of the Gulag system that took place from 1947 to 1953.]]\nAfter World War II the number of inmates in prison camps and colonies, again, rose sharply, reaching approximately 2.5 million people by the early 1950s (about 1.7 million of whom were in camps).\n\nWhen the war in Europe ended in May 1945, as many as two million former Russian citizens were [[Operation Keelhaul|forcefully repatriated into the USSR]].<ref>Mark Elliott. \"The United States and Forced Repatriation of Soviet Citizens, 1944\u201347,\" ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 88, No. 2 (June 1973), pp. 253\u2013275.</ref> On February 11, 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] signed a Repatriation Agreement with the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"darkside\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |title=Repatriation \u2013 The Dark Side of World War II |publisher=Fff.org |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117182523/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |archivedate=January 17, 2012 }}</ref> One interpretation of this agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets.

However, to one degree or another, the large majority of prisoners at most times faced meagre food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care. Most prisoners were compelled to perform harsh physical labour.<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 The Gulag Collection: Paintings of Nikolai Getman]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127121250/http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 |date=November 27, 2007 }}</ref> In most periods and economic branches, the degree of mechanisation of work processes was significantly lower than in the civilian industry: tools were often primitive and machinery, if existent, short in supply. Officially established work hours were in most periods longer and days off were fewer than for civilian workers.

Besides a wide array of punishments for prisoners refusing to work (which, in practice, were sometimes applied to prisoners that were too enfeebled to meet [[production quota]]), they instituted a number of positive incentives intended to boost productivity. These included monetary bonuses (since the early 1930s) and wage payments (from 1950 onward), cuts of individual sentences, general early-release schemes for norm fulfilment and overfulfilment (until 1939, again in selected camps from 1946 onward), preferential treatment, and privileges for the most productive workers ([[Udarnik|shock workers]] or [[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovites]] in Soviet parlance).<ref name=\"borodkin\">Leonid Borodkin and Simon Ertz 'Forced Labor and the Need for Motivation: Wages and Bonuses in the Stalinist Camp System', ''Comparative Economic Studies'', June 2005, Vol.47, Iss. 2, pp. 418\u2013436.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shack from Gulag - Museum of the Occupation of Latvia.JPG|thumb|Shack from Gulag \u2013 reconstruction in [[Museum of the Occupation of Latvia]]]]\n\nA distinctive incentive scheme that included both coercive and motivational elements and was applied universally in all camps consisted in standardised \"nourishment scales\": the size of the inmates' ration depended on the percentage of the work quota delivered. [[Naftaly Frenkel]] is credited for the introduction of this policy. While it was effective in compelling many prisoners to work harder, for many a prisoner it had the adverse effect, accelerating the exhaustion and sometimes causing the death of persons unable to fulfil high production quota.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 the conditions in camps worsened drastically: quotas were increased, rations cut, and medical supplies came close to none, all of which led to a sharp increase in mortality. The situation slowly improved in the final period and after the end of the war.\n\nConsidering the overall conditions and their influence on inmates, it is important to distinguish three major strata of Gulag inmates:\n\n*\"[[Kulak]]s\", [[osadnik]]s, \"[[ukaznik]]s\" (people sentenced for violation of various [[ukase]]s, such as [[Law of Spikelets]], decree about work discipline, etc.), occasional violators of [[criminal law]]\n*Dedicated criminals: \"[[thieves in law]]\"\n*People sentenced for various [[political prisoner|political]] and religious reasons.\n\n=== Gulag and famine (1932\u20131933) ===\nA severe [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1931\u20131933]] swept across many different regions in the Soviet Union. During this time, it is estimated that around six to seven million people starved to death.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=55}}</ref> On 7 August 1932, a new edict drafted by Stalin specified a minimum sentence of ten years or execution for theft from collective farms or of cooperative property. Over the next few months, prosecutions rose fourfold. A large share of cases prosecuted under the law were for the theft of small quantities of grain worth less than fifty rubles. The law was later relaxed on 8 May 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/archive/persa/010fulltext.pdf|title=Theft Under Stalin: A Property Rights Analysis|last=Gorlizki|first=Yoram|date=28 June 2001|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Overall, during the first half of 1933, prisons saw more new incoming inmates than the three previous years combined.\n\nPrisoners in the camps faced harsh working conditions. One Soviet report stated that, in early 1933, up to 15% of the prison population in [[Soviet Uzbekistan]] died monthly. During this time, prisoners were getting around {{convert|300|Cal|kJ}} worth of food a day. Many inmates attempted to flee, causing an upsurge in coercive and violent measures. Camps were directed \"not to spare bullets\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=61}}</ref> The bodies of inmates who tried to escape were commonly displayed in the courtyards of the camps, and the administrators would forcibly escort the inmates around the dead bodies as a message. Until 1934, lack of food and the outbreak of diseases started to destabilise the Gulag system. It wasn't until the famine ended that the system started to stabilize.\n\n=== Social conditions ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe convicts in such camps were actively involved in all kinds of labour with one of them being [[logging]] (''lesopoval''). The working territory of logging presented by itself a square and was surrounded by forest clearing. Thus, all attempts to exit or escape from it were well observed from the four towers set at each of its corners.\n\nLocals who captured a [[Fugitive|runaway]] were given rewards.<ref>\"[http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ Nikolai Getman: The Gulag Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513172402/http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ |date=May 13, 2012 }}\"</ref> It is also said that Gulags in colder areas were less concerned with finding escaped prisoners as they would die anyhow from the severely cold winters.

Remote monasteries in particular were frequently reused as sites for new camps. The site on the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the [[White Sea]] is one of the earliest and also most noteworthy, taking root soon after the Revolution in 1918.<ref name=\"Applebaum 2003\" /> The [[colloquial]] name for the islands, \"[[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]]\", entered the [[vernacular]] as a [[synonym]] for the labor camp in general. It was presented to the world as an example of the new Soviet method for \"re-education of [[class enemy|class enemies]]\" and reintegrating them through labor into Soviet society. Initially the inmates, largely Russian [[intelligentsia]], enjoyed relative freedom (within the natural confinement of the islands). Local newspapers and magazines were published and even some scientific research was carried out (e.g., a local botanical garden was maintained but unfortunately later lost completely). Eventually Solovki turned into an ordinary Gulag camp; in fact some historians maintain that it was a pilot camp of this type. In 1929 [[Maxim Gorky]] visited the camp and published an apology for it. The report of Gorky's trip to Solovki was included in the cycle of impressions titled \"Po Soiuzu Sovetov,\" Part V, subtitled \"Solovki.\" In the report, Gorky wrote that \"camps such as 'Solovki' were absolutely necessary.\"<ref name=Yedlin>{{cite book|last=Yedlin|first=Tova|title=Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96605-8|page=188 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zxt5_vI_ozcC&pg=PA188}}</ref>\n\nWith the new emphasis on Gulag as the means of concentrating cheap labour, new camps were then constructed throughout the Soviet sphere of influence, wherever the economic task at hand dictated their existence (or was designed specifically to avail itself of them, such as the [[White Sea-Baltic Canal]] or the [[Baikal Amur Mainline]]), including facilities in big cities \u2014 parts of the famous [[Moscow Metro]] and the [[Moscow State University]] new campus were built by forced labor. Many more projects during the rapid industrialisation of the 1930s, [[World War II|war-time]] and post-war periods were fulfilled on the backs of convicts. The activity of Gulag camps spanned a wide cross-section of Soviet industry. Gorky organised in 1933 a trip of 120 writers and artists to the White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal, 36 of them wrote a propaganda book about the construction published in 1934 and destroyed in 1937.\n\n[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Genrikh Yagoda]] (middle) inspecting the construction of the [[Moscow Canal|Moscow-Volga canal]].

However, camps were generally spread throughout the entire [[Soviet Union]], including the European parts of [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. There were several camps outside the Soviet Union, in [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Mongolia]], which were under the direct control of the Gulag.\n\nNot all camps were fortified; some in Siberia were marked only by posts. Escape was deterred by the harsh elements, as well as tracking dogs that were assigned to each camp. While during the 1920s and 1930s native tribes often aided escapees, many of the tribes were also [[victimised]] by escaped thieves. Tantalised by large rewards as well, they began aiding authorities in the capture of Gulag inmates. Camp guards were given stern incentive to keep their inmates in line at all costs; if a prisoner escaped under a guard's watch, the guard would often be stripped of his uniform and become a Gulag inmate himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Further, if an escaping prisoner was shot, guards could be fined amounts that were often equivalent to one or two weeks wages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n[[File:Ru200008020027.jpg|thumb|upright|Part of 'Project 503' to build a railroad from [[Salekhard]] to [[Igarka]] near [[Turukhansk]] on the [[Yenisey]]]]\n\nIn some cases, teams of inmates were dropped off in new territory with a limited supply of resources and left to set up a new camp or die.

It would be virtually impossible to reflect the entire mass of Gulag facilities on a map that would also account for the various times of their existence.<ref name=\"Ivanova 2000\" /></blockquote>\n\nSince many of these existed only for short periods, the number of camp administrations at any given point was lower. It peaked in the early 1950s, when there were more than 100 camp administrations across the Soviet Union.

The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the 'moral explanation'. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on the darker side of human nature \u2013 providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. Another approach is the 'political explanation', according to which the Gulag (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime's perceived political enemies (this understanding is favoured by historian Robert Conquest, amongst others). The 'economic explanation', in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalised the Gulag for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin's death in 1953. Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates the Gulag in the context of modern projects of 'cleansing' the social body of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Death and Redemption: The Gulag and the Shaping of Soviet Society|last=Barnes|first=Stephen A.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-691-15112-0|location=Princeton|pages=7\u201316|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Hannah Arendt]] argued that as part of a [[totalitarian]] system of government, the camps of the Gulag system were experiments in \"total domination.\" In her view, the goal of a totalitarian system was not merely to establish limits on liberty, but rather to abolish liberty entirely in service of its ideology. She argues that the Gulag system was not merely political repression because the system survived and grew long after Stalin had wiped out all serious political resistance. Although the various camps were initially filled with criminals and political prisoners, eventually they were filled with prisoners who were arrested irrespective of anything relating to them as individuals, but rather only on the basis of their membership in some ever shifting category of imagined threats to the state.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 437 \u2013 59</ref>\n\nShe also argues that the function of the Gulag system was not truly economic. Although the Soviet government deemed them all \"forced labour\" camps, this in fact highlighted that the work in the camps was deliberately pointless, since all Russian workers could be subject to forced labour.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 444 \u2013 45</ref> The only real economic purpose they typically served was financing the cost of their own supervision. Otherwise the work performed was generally useless, either by design or made that way through extremely poor planning and execution; some workers even preferred more difficult work if it was actually productive. She differentiated between \"authentic\" forced-labour camps, concentration camps, and \"annihilation camps\". In authentic labour camps, inmates worked in \"relative freedom and are sentenced for limited periods.\" Concentration camps had extremely high mortality rates and but were still \"essentially organised for labour purposes.\" Annihilation camps were those where the inmates were \"systematically wiped out through starvation and neglect.\" She criticises other commentators' conclusion that the purpose of the camps was a supply of cheap labour. According to her, the Soviets were able to liquidate the camp system without serious economic consequences, showing that the camps were not an important source of labour and were overall economically irrelevant.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nArendt argues that together with the systematised, arbitrary cruelty inside the camps, this served the purpose of total domination by eliminating the idea that the arrestees had any political or legal rights. Morality was destroyed by maximising cruelty and by organising the camps internally to make the inmates and guards complicit. The terror resulting from operation of the Gulag system caused people outside of the camps to cut all ties with anyone who was arrested or purged and to avoid forming ties with others for fear of being associated with anyone who was targeted. As a result, the camps were essential as the nucleus of a system that destroyed individuality and dissolved all social bonds. Thereby, the system attempted to eliminate any capacity for resistance or self-directed action in the greater population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Archival documents ===\nStatistical reports made by the [[OGPU]]-[[NKVD]]-[[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]]-[[MVD]] between the 1930s and 1950s are kept in the [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]] formerly called Central State Archive of the October Revolution (CSAOR).

On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The decrement in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree of reliability of the reports.<ref name=\"\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438\">{{cite journal|last=\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440|title=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 (1917\u20131990 \u0433\u0433.).|journal=\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f XXI|year=1994|issue=\u2116 1\u20132|pages=107\u2013124|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330205748/http://kob.rv.ua/doki-dai/dotu/other/zemskov/zemskov_politrepressii(1917-1990).pdf |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, the first precise statistical data on the Gulag based on the Gulag archives were published by [[Viktor Zemskov]].<ref name=\"Rousso, Golsan\">{{cite book|last1=Rousso|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Rousso|last2=Golsan|first2=Richard|title=Stalinism and nazism: history and memory compared|year=2004|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-9000-6|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CIt7fMp30sAC&printsec=frontcover#PPA92,M1}}</ref> These had been generally accepted by leading Western scholars,<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /><ref name=Ellman_SRS />  despite the fact that a number of inconsistencies were found in this statistics.<ref name= Vishnevsky /> It is also necessary to note that not all the conclusions drawn by Zemskov based on his data have been generally accepted.

He added that without distinguishing the degree of accuracy and reliability of certain figures, without making a critical analysis of sources, without comparing new data with already known information, Zemskov absolutises the published materials by presenting them as the ultimate truth.

In his words, the trouble with most western writers is that they do not benefit from such comparisons. Zemskov added that when he tried not to overuse the juxtaposition of new information with \"old\" one, it was only because of a sense of delicacy, not to once again psychologically traumatise the researchers whose works used incorrect figures, as it turned out after the publication of the statistics by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD.<ref name=\"\u041a \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0443\" />\n\nAccording to French historian [[Nicolas Werth]], the mountains of the materials of the Gulag archives, which are stored in funds of the [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]] and are being constantly exposed during the last fifteen years, represent only a very small part of bureaucratic prose of immense size left over the decades of \"creativity\" by the \"dull and reptile\" organisation managing the Gulag.

As a rule, they were situated in remote parts of the USSR, and labour conditions were extremely hard there. They formed a core of the GULAG system. The inmates of \"corrective labour colonies\" served shorter terms; these colonies were located in less remote parts of the USSR, and they were run by local NKVD administration.<ref name=\"GRZ\" /> Preliminary analysis of the GULAG camps and colonies statistics (see the chart on the right) demonstrated that the population reached the maximum before the World War II, then dropped sharply, partially due to massive releases, partially due to wartime high mortality, and then was gradually increasing until the end of Stalin era, reaching the global maximum in 1953, when the combined population of GULAG camps and labour colonies amounted to 2,625,000.<ref name=\"Anatoly Vishnevsky\">[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema05.php \"The Total Number of Repressed\"], by [[Anatoly Vishnevsky]], Director of the Center for Human Demography and Ecology, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nThe results of these archival studies convinced many scholars, including [[Robert Conquest]]<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> or Stephen Wheatcroft to reconsider their earlier estimates of the size of the GULAG population, although the 'high numbers' of arrested and deaths are not radically different from earlier estimates.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Although such scholars as Rosefielde or Vishnevsky point at several inconsistencies in archival data with Rosefielde pointing out the archival figure of 1,196,369 for the population of the Gulag and labor colonies combined on December 31, 1936 is less than half the 2.75 million labor camp population given to the Census Board by the NKVD for the 1937 census,<ref>http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/rosefielde.pdf</ref><ref name= Vishnevsky>Vishnevsky, Alantoly. \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439 (The Demographic Loss of Repression), Demoscope Weekly, December 31, 2007, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema06.php retrieved] April 13, 2011</ref> it is generally believed that these data provide more reliable and detailed information that the indirect data and literary sources available for the scholars during the Cold War era.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> Although Conquest cited Beria's report to the Politburo of the labor camp numbers at the end of 1938 stating there were almost 7 million prisoners in the labor camps, more than three times the archival figure for 1938 and an official report to Stalin by the Soviet minister of State Security in 1952 stating there were 12 million prisoners in the labor camps.<ref>https://www.bu.edu/iscip/pubseries/PubSeries1conquest.pdf</ref>\n\nThese data allowed scholars to conclude that during the period of 1928\u201353, about 14 million prisoners passed through the system of GULAG ''labour camps'' and 4\u20135 million passed through the ''labour colonies''.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Thus, these figures reflect the number of convicted persons, and do not take into account the fact that a significant part of Gulag inmates had been convicted more than one time, so the actual number of convicted is somewhat overstated by these statistics.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> From other hand, during some periods of Gulag history the official figures of GULAG population reflected the camps' capacity, not the actual number of inmates, so the actual figures were 15% higher in, e.g. 1946.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" />\n\n== Influence ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\n\n=== Culture ===\n<!-- this section is for the general influence on the Soviet culture of **Gulag itself**, not a list of publications about Gulag -->\n\nThe Gulag spanned nearly four decades of Soviet and East European history and affected millions of individuals. Its cultural impact was enormous.\n\nThe Gulag has become a major influence on contemporary Russian thinking, and an important part of modern [[Russian folklore]].  Many songs by the authors-performers known as the [[Bard (Soviet Union)|''bards'']], most notably [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]], neither of whom ever served time in the camps, describe life inside the Gulag and glorified the life of \"Zeks\". Words and phrases which originated in the labor camps became part of the Russian/Soviet vernacular in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe memoirs of [[Alexander Dolgun]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Varlam Shalamov]] and [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]], among others, became a symbol of defiance in Soviet society.  These writings harshly chastised the Soviet people for their tolerance and apathy regarding the Gulag, but at the same time provided a testament to the courage and resolve of those who were imprisoned.\n\nAnother cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union linked with the Gulag was the forced migration of many artists and other people of culture to Siberia. This resulted in a Renaissance of sorts in places like [[Magadan]], where, for example, the quality of theatre production was comparable to [[Moscow]]'s and [[Eddie Rosner]] played jazz.\n\n==== Literature ====\nMany eyewitness accounts of Gulag prisoners have been published:\n[[File:1929-ShalamovV.jpg|thumb|[[Varlam Shalamov]] after first arrest, 1929]]\n* [[Varlam Shalamov]]'s ''[[The Kolyma Tales|Kolyma Tales]]'' is a short-story collection, cited by most major works on the Gulag, and widely considered one of the main Soviet accounts.\n* [[Victor Kravchenko (defector)|Victor Kravchenko]] wrote ''[[I Chose Freedom (book)|I Chose Freedom]]'' after defecting to the [[United States]] in 1944. As a leader of industrial plants he had encountered forced labour camps in across the Soviet Union from 1935 to 1941. He describes a visit to one camp at [[Kemerovo]] on the [[Tom River]] in Siberia. Factories paid a fixed sum to the [[KGB]] for every convict they employed.\n* [[Anatoli Granovsky]] wrote ''I Was an NKVD Agent'' after [[Defection|defecting]] to [[Sweden]] in 1946 and included his experiences seeing gulag prisoners as a young boy, as well as his experiences as a prisoner himself in 1939. Granovsky's father was sent to the gulag in 1937.\n* [[Julius Margolin]]'s book ''A Travel to the Land Ze-Ka'' was finished in 1947, but it was impossible to publish such a book about the Soviet Union at the time, immediately after World War II.\n* [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]] wrote ''A World Apart'', which was translated into English by Andrzej Ciolkosz and published with an introduction by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1951. By describing life in the gulag in a harrowing personal account, it provides an in-depth, original analysis of the nature of the Soviet communist system.\n* [[Victor Herman]]'s book ''Coming out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life''. Herman experienced firsthand many places, prisons, and experiences that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was able to reference in only passing or through brief second hand accounts.\n* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' was not the first literary work about labour camps. His previous book on the subject, \"[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]\", about a typical day in the life of a Gulag inmate, was originally published in the most prestigious Soviet monthly, ''[[Novy Mir]]'' (''New World''), in November 1962, but was soon banned and withdrawn from all libraries. It was the first work to demonstrate the Gulag as an instrument of governmental repression against its own citizens on a massive scale. ''[[The First Circle]]'', an account of three days in the lives of prisoners in the ''[[Marfino]]'' ''[[sharashka]]'' or special prison was submitted for publication to the Soviet authorities shortly after ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' but was rejected and later published abroad in 1968.\n* [[Slavomir Rawicz]]'s book \"[[The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom]]\": In 1941, the author and six other fellow prisoners escaped a Soviet labour camp in Yakutsk\u2014a camp where enduring hunger, cold, untended wounds, untreated illnesses, and avoiding daily executions were everyday horrors. \n* [[J\u00e1nos R\u00f3zs\u00e1s]], a Hungarian writer, often referred to as the Hungarian Solzhenitsyn,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.raptisrarebooks.com/product/one-day-in-the-life-of-ivan-denisovich-inscribed-first-edition-alexander-solzhenitsyn-signed/ | title=One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich}}</ref> wrote many books and articles on the issue of the Gulag.\n*[[Zoltan Szalkai]], a Hungarian documentary filmmaker, made several films about gulag camps.\n* [[Karlo \u0160tajner]], a Croatian communist who was active in the former [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the manager of the [[Comintern Publishing House]] in Moscow 1932\u201339, was arrested one night and taken from his Moscow home after being accused of anti-revolutionary activities. He spent the next 20 years in camps from Solovki to Norilsk. After USSR\u2013[[Yugoslavia]]n political normalization he was re-tried and quickly found innocent. He left the Soviet Union with his wife, who had been waiting for him for 20 years, in 1956 and spent the rest of his life in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. He wrote an impressive book titled ''7000 days in Siberia''.\n* ''Dancing Under the Red Star'' by [[Karl Tobien]] ({{ISBN|1-4000-7078-3}}) tells the story of Margaret Werner, an athletic girl who moves to Russia right before the start of Stalin's terror. She faces many hardships, as her father is taken away from her and imprisoned. Werner is the only American woman who survived the Gulag to tell about it.\n* ''Alexander Dolgun's Story: An American in the Gulag'' ({{ISBN|0-394-49497-0}}), by a member of the US Embassy, and ''I Was a Slave in Russia'' ({{ISBN|0-8159-5800-5}}), an American factory owner's son, were two more American citizens interned who wrote of their ordeal. They were interned due to their American citizenship for about eight years c. 1946\u201355.\n* [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]] wrote two famous books about her remembrances, ''Journey Into the Whirlwind'' and ''Within the Whirlwind''.\n*[[Savi\u0107 Markovi\u0107 \u0160tedimlija]], a pro-[[Croatia]]n Montenegrin ideologist. Caught in [[Austria]] by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, he was sent to the USSR and spent ten years in the Gulag. After his release, Markovi\u0107 wrote his autobiographical account in two volumes titled ''Ten years in Gulag'' (''Deset godina u Gulagu'', Matica crnogorska, Podgorica, Montenegro 2004).\n* [[Ani\u021ba Nandri\u0219-Cudla]]'s book, ''20 Years in Siberia [20 de ani \u00een Siberia]'' is the own life's account written by a Romanian peasant woman from Bucovina (Mahala village near Cern\u0103u\u021bi) who managed to survive the harsh, forced labour system together with her three sons.  Together with her husband and her three underage children, she was deported from Mahala village to the Soviet  Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, at the Polar Circle, without a trial or even a communicated accusation. The same night of June 12 to 13, 1941, (that is before the breakout of the Second World War), overall 602 fellow villagers were arrested and deported, without any prior notice. Her mother received the same sentence but was spared from deportation after the fact that she was a paraplegic was acknowledged by the authorities.  It was later discovered that the reason for her deportation and forced labour was the fake and nonsensical claim that, allegedly, her husband had been a mayor in the Romanian administration, a politician and a rich peasant, none of the latter of which was true. Separated from her husband, she brought up the three boys, overcame  [[typhus]], [[scorbutus]], [[malnutrition]], extreme cold and harsh toils, to later return to Bucovina after rehabilitation. Her manuscript was written toward the end of her life, in the simple and direct language of a peasant with three years of public school education, and was secretly brought to Romania before the fall of Romanian communism, in 1982. Her manuscript was first published in 1991. Her deportation was shared mainly with Romanians from Bucovina and Basarabia, Finnish and Polish prisoners, as token proof to show that Gulag labour camps had also been used for the shattering/ extermination of the natives in the newly occupied territories of the Soviet Union.\n* [[Frantsishak Alyakhnovich]] \u2013 Solovki prisoner\n* [[Blagoy Popov]], a Bulgarian communist and a defendant in the [[Leipzig trial]], along with [[Georgi Dimitrov]] and [[Vasil Tanev]], was arrested in 1937 during the [[Stalinist purges]] and spent seventeen years in [[Norillag]]. Popov was released in 1954, after the death of Stalin, and returned to [[Bulgaria]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438|last=\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432|first=\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0439|publisher=\u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \"\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\"|year=2012|isbn=978-619-152-025-1|location=\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f|pages=37, 57}}</ref> He wrote his autobiographical account in the book ''From the Leipzig trial to the Siberia camps'' (''\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438'', \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, 2012 {{ISBN|978-619-152-025-1}}).\n* [[Mkrtich Armen]], an Armenian writer who was imprisoned in 1937 and rehabilitated in 1945, published a collection of his memories under the title \"They Ordered to Give You\" in 1964.\n* [[Gurgen Mahari]], an Armenian writer and poet, who was arrested in 1936, released in 1947, arrested again in 1948 and sent into Siberian exile as an \"unreliable type\" until 1954, wrote \"Barbed Wires in Blossom\", a novella based largely on his personal experiences in a Soviet gulag.\n\n=== Colonisation ===\n[[File:Vorkuta r.jpg|thumb|The city of [[Vorkuta]]]]\nSoviet [[wikisource:\u041e\u0431 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445|state documents]] show that the goals of the gulag included colonisation of sparsely populated remote areas.

In addition, for persons who served full term, but who were denied the free choice of place of residence, it was recommended to assign them for \"free settlement\" and give them land in the general vicinity of the place of confinement.\n\nThe gulag inherited this approach from the [[katorga]] system.\n\nIt is estimated that of the 40,000 people collecting state pensions in [[Vorkuta Gulag|Vorkuta]], 32,000 are trapped former gulag inmates, or their descendants.<ref>Robert Conquest, Paul Hollander: Political violence: belief, behavior, and legitimation p.55, Palgrave Macmillan;(2008) {{ISBN|978-0-230-60646-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Life after term served ===\nPersons who served a term in a camp or in a prison were restricted from taking a wide range of jobs.

The rubrospinal tract facilitates [[motor neuron]]s in the cervical spinal cord supplying the flexor muscles of the upper extremities. The rubrospinal tract and [[reticulospinal tract|medullary reticulospinal tract]] biased flexion outweighs the [[vestibulospinal tract|medial and lateral vestibulospinal]] and [[reticulospinal tract|pontine reticulospinal tract]] biased extension in the upper extremities.\n* The second component of decorticate posturing is the disruption of the lateral [[corticospinal tract]] which facilitates motor neurons in the lower spinal cord supplying flexor muscles of the lower extremities. Since the corticospinal tract is interrupted, the pontine reticulospinal and the medial and lateral vestibulospinal biased extension tracts greatly overwhelm the medullary reticulospinal biased flexion tract.\n\nThe effects on these two tracts (corticospinal and rubrospinal) by lesions above the red nucleus is what leads to the characteristic flexion posturing of the upper extremities and extensor posturing of the lower extremities.\n\nDecorticate posturing indicates that there may be damage to areas including the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s, the [[internal capsule]], and the [[thalamus]].<ref name=\"Cuccurullo04\"/> It may also indicate damage to the [[mesencephalon|midbrain]].  While decorticate posturing is still an ominous sign of severe [[brain damage]], decerebrate posturing is usually indicative of more severe damage at the rubrospinal tract, and hence, the red nucleus is also involved, indicating a lesion lower in the brainstem.\n\n===Decerebrate===\n\n[[File:Decerebrate.jpg|thumb|450px|Decerebrate rigidity or abnormal extensor posturing.]]\n\nDecerebrate posturing is also called decerebrate response, decerebrate rigidity, or extensor posturing.

It is exhibited by people with lesions or compression in the [[midbrain]] and lesions in the [[cerebellum]].<ref name=\"Cuccurullo04\"/> Decerebrate posturing is commonly seen in [[pons|pontine]] strokes.  A patient with decorticate posturing may begin to show decerebrate posturing, or may go from one form of posturing to the other.<ref name=\"AllRefer.com\"/>  Progression from decorticate posturing to decerebrate posturing is often indicative of uncal (transtentorial) or tonsilar [[brain herniation]].  Activation of [[gamma motor neuron]]s is thought to be important in decerebrate rigidity due to studies in animals showing that dorsal root transection eliminates decerebrate rigidity symptoms.<ref>Berne and Levy principles of physiology/[editors] Matthew N.

The rubrospinal tract facilitates [[motor neuron]]s in the cervical spinal cord supplying the flexor muscles of the upper extremities. The rubrospinal tract and [[reticulospinal tract|medullary reticulospinal tract]] biased flexion outweighs the [[vestibulospinal tract|medial and lateral vestibulospinal]] and [[reticulospinal tract|pontine reticulospinal tract]] biased extension in the upper extremities.\n* The second component of decorticate posturing is the disruption of the lateral [[corticospinal tract]] which facilitates motor neurons in the lower spinal cord supplying flexor muscles of the lower extremities. Since the corticospinal tract is interrupted, the pontine reticulospinal and the medial and lateral vestibulospinal biased extension tracts greatly overwhelm the medullary reticulospinal biased flexion tract.\n\nThe effects on these two tracts (corticospinal and rubrospinal) by lesions above the red nucleus is what leads to the characteristic flexion posturing of the upper extremities and extensor posturing of the lower extremities.\n\nDecorticate posturing indicates that there may be damage to areas including the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s, the [[internal capsule]], and the [[thalamus]].<ref name=\"Cuccurullo04\"/> It may also indicate damage to the [[mesencephalon|midbrain]].  While decorticate posturing is still an ominous sign of severe [[brain damage]], decerebrate posturing is usually indicative of more severe damage at the rubrospinal tract, and hence, the red nucleus is also involved, indicating a lesion lower in the brainstem.\n\n===Decerebrate===\n\n[[File:Decerebrate.jpg|thumb|450px|Decerebrate rigidity or abnormal extensor posturing.]]\n\nDecerebrate posturing is also called decerebrate response, decerebrate rigidity, or extensor posturing.  It describes the involuntary extension of the [[upper limb|upper extremities]] in response to external [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]].

It is exhibited by people with lesions or compression in the [[midbrain]] and lesions in the [[cerebellum]].<ref name=\"Cuccurullo04\"/> Decerebrate posturing is commonly seen in [[pons|pontine]] strokes.  A patient with decorticate posturing may begin to show decerebrate posturing, or may go from one form of posturing to the other.<ref name=\"AllRefer.com\"/>  Progression from decorticate posturing to decerebrate posturing is often indicative of uncal (transtentorial) or tonsilar [[brain herniation]].  Activation of [[gamma motor neuron]]s is thought to be important in decerebrate rigidity due to studies in animals showing that dorsal root transection eliminates decerebrate rigidity symptoms.<ref>Berne and Levy principles of physiology/[editors] Matthew N.

Anderson was born in [[Dunfermline]], [[Scotland]] and grew up in [[Edinburgh]] before moving to Blackpool in January 1960.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=4}} Evans had become a fan of [[the Beatles]] after seeing them play \"[[Love Me Do]]\" on [[Granada Television]]'s ''Scene at 6:30''. Though he was an accomplished pianist, he decided to take up the drums, as it was an instrument featured in the Beatles' line-up.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=5\u20136}} Anderson had acquired a [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]] and taught himself how to play it, and the pair decided to form a band.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=7}} The pair recruited Hammond on bass, who brought along his collection of [[blues music|blues]] records to listen to.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=8}}\n\nThe group initially played as a three piece at local clubs and venues, before Evans became influenced by [[Georgie Fame]] and [[the Animals]] and switched to organ, recruiting drummer [[Barriemore Barlow|Barrie Barlow]]{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=14\u201315}} and guitarist Mike Stephens from local band the Atlantics.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=12}}{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=12}} By 1964 the band had recruited guitarist Chris Riley{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=12}} and developed into a six-piece [[blue-eyed soul]] band called the John Evan Band (later the John Evan Smash). Evans had shortened his surname to \"Evan\" at the insistence of Hammond, who thought it sounded better and more unusual. The group recruited Johnny Taylor as a booking agent and played gigs further afield around northwest England,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=15}} playing a mixture of blues and [[Motown]] covers.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=14}} Hammond subsequently quit the band to go to [[art school]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=15}} He was briefly replaced by Derek Ward, then by [[Glenn Cornick]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=17}} Riley also quit and was replaced by Neil Smith.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=17}} The group recorded three songs at Regent Sound Studios in [[Denmark Street]], London in April 1967, and appeared at [[The Marquee]] club in June.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=27}}\n\nIn November 1967, the band moved to the London area, basing themselves in [[Luton]]. They signed a management deal with Terry Ellis and Chris Wright and replaced Smith with guitarist [[Mick Abrahams]],{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=19}} but quickly realised that supporting a 6-piece band was financially impractical, and the group split up. Anderson, Abrahams and Cornick decided to stay together, recruiting Abrahams' friend [[Clive Bunker]] on drums{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=18}} and becoming a [[British blues]] band.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=26}} Cornick recalled that although Evan left, the band said he was welcome to rejoin at a later date.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=27}} Anderson shared a ground-floor flat with Cornick in a large house at the top of Studley Road in Luton,<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/zzjul76.htm Zigzag, July 1976]</ref> and worked as a cleaner for the Luton Ritz Cinema to pay the rent.<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/bbc79a.htm BBC Radio interview, March 1979]</ref> According to Cornick, \"we were so poor that we would share one can of stew or soup between us each evening.\" <ref>[https://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2011/12/glenn-cornick-interview-about-jethro.html Psychedelic Baby Magazine, 13 December 2011] Retrieved 22 September 2019</ref>\n\n===Early years (1967\u20131968)===\nAt first, the new band had trouble getting repeat bookings and they took to changing their name frequently to continue playing the London club circuit, names which included \"Navy Blue\", \"Ian Henderson's Bag o' Nails\", and \"Candy Coloured Rain\". Anderson recalled looking at a poster at a club and concluding that the band name he didn't recognise was his.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=22}} Band names were often supplied by their booking agents' staff, one of whom, a history enthusiast, eventually christened them \"Jethro Tull\" after [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|the 18th-century agriculturist]]. The name stuck because they happened to be using it the first time a club manager liked their show enough to invite them to return.<ref name=\"billboard end\"/> They recorded a session with producer [[Derek Lawrence]], which resulted in the single \"Sunshine Day\". The B-side \"Aeroplane\" was an old John Evan Band track with the saxophones mixed out. It was released in February 1968 on [[MGM Records]], miscredited to \"Jethro Toe\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=23\u201323}} Anderson has since questioned the misnomer as a way to avoid paying royalties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austindaze.com/2006/08/29/jethro-tull-ian-anderson/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108173613/http://www.austindaze.com/2006/08/29/jethro-tull-ian-anderson/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 November 2011 |title=Jethro Tull (Ian Anderson) |publisher=Austin Daze |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref> The more common version, with the name spelled correctly, is actually a [[counterfeit]] made in New York.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dag Sandbu |url=http://www.collecting-tull.com/Collectibles/7_JethroToe.htm |title=MGM Jethro Toe |publisher=Collecting-tull.com |accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> Anderson later met Hammond while in London and the two renewed their friendship, while Anderson moved into a [[bedsit]] in Chelsea with Evan.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=35}} Hammond became the subject of several songs, beginning with their next single, \"A Song for Jeffrey\".{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=36}}\n\nAnderson possessed a large [[overcoat]], his father having given it to him with the words \"You'd better take this.

It was around this time that Anderson purchased a flute after becoming frustrated with his inability to play guitar as well as Abrahams, and because their managers thought he should remain a rhythm guitarist, with Abrahams becoming the front man.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=24}} \n\n<blockquote>I didn't want to be just another third-rate guitar player who sounded like a bunch of other third-rate guitar players.

The band have since claimed that the success at Sunbury was a result of their persistent touring, which had generated a grassroots following who had all assembled at the festival and encouraged the rest of the audience. Cornick recalled, \"from that moment on, we were a big band\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe group recorded their first album, ''[[This Was]]'', between June and August 1968, and it was released in October, reaching number 10 in the charts.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=41,42}} In addition to original material, the album included the traditional \"Cat's Squirrel\", which highlighted Abrahams' blues-rock style, while the [[Rahsaan Roland Kirk]]-penned jazz piece \"Serenade to a Cuckoo\" gave Anderson a showcase for his growing talents on the flute.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=42}} The overall sound of the group at this time was described in the ''[[Record Mirror]]'' by Anderson in 1968 as \"a sort of progressive blues with a bit of jazz\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/rm12oct68.htm |title=Record Mirror, 12 October, 1968 |access-date=11 February 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61DN3yU3K?url=http://www.tullpress.com/rm12oct68.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the album's release, Abrahams left the band in December to form his own group, [[Blodwyn Pig]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=43}} There were a number of reasons given for his departure.

After a week's rehearsal, O'List didn't show up and lost contact with the group. The next choice was [[Mick Taylor]], who turned the group down because he felt his current gig with [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]] was a better deal.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=43}} Following this, the group put an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' which was answered by [[Tony Iommi]]. After a few rehearsals, the group appeared in ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' on 11 December. The group performed \"A Song for Jeffrey\", but only Anderson's singing and flute were live; the rest was [[mime]]d. Iommi felt closer to his old band, 'Earth' (now known as Black Sabbath), so he returned to Birmingham to rejoin them. \n\nThe next choice was [[Martin Barre]], who had seen the band perform at Sunbury,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=47}} and had been tried out at the same audition as Iommi. Barre arranged a second audition with Anderson, who showed him some new songs that were in a different style to the blues they had been recording. Anderson was impressed by Barre's technique, and offered him the job as the new guitarist.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=44}} Barre played his first gig with Jethro Tull on 30 December 1968 at the Winter Gardens, Penzance.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=30}}\n\n===''Stand Up'' through ''Aqualung'' (1969\u20131971)===\nAfter Barre joined, the group did a few shows supporting [[Jimi Hendrix]] in Scandinavia,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=49}} then set out on an extensive tour of the US, supporting [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Vanilla Fudge]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=31}} Having attracted a substantial live following, Ellis and Wright asked Anderson, who had become the dominant songwriter, to write a hit single. The result was \"[[Living in the Past (song)|Living in the Past]]\", which reached No. 3 in May on the UK singles chart and No. 11 in the US,{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=31}} and resulted in an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. Although other so-called \"serious\" groups actively resisted issuing stand-alone singles at the time, Jethro Tull felt a hit single was a positive move for the group, if not their priority.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=32}}\n\n[[File:Jethro-Tull-9-73(2).jpg|thumb|140px|[[John Evan]], an old schoolfriend and bandmate, joined the band in April 1970, after several invitations to do so]]\nThe next album was ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'', recorded during April\u2013May and August 1969.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=52}} It was released in September, and quickly reached No. 1 in the UK charts, the only album by the group to do so.

The album was split into two sides, subtitled 'Aqualung' and 'My God', and featured Anderson's opinions about organised religion.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=76}} Recording the album was problematic because of technical issues in the studio and Hammond's rusty musical skills. On \"Locomotive Breath\", Anderson recorded the backing track on his own, singing along to a [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] accompaniment, which the rest of the band recorded on top of later.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=77}} Despite Anderson's concerns that it may have been \"too radical\" compared with the band's previous albums, ''Aqualung'' was the first Jethro Tull album to reach the top ten in the US, peaking at No. 7.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=186}} It sold over one million copies, earning it a [[Music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in July 1971.{{sfn|Murrells|1978|p=295}}\n\n===Progressive rock (1972\u20131976)===\nBecause of the heavy touring schedule and his wish to spend more time with his family, drummer Bunker quit the group after the ''Aqualung'' album in May 1971,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=80}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/the-attic/past-band-members-and-guests/clive-bunker/ |title=Clive Bunker&nbsp;\u2013 The Official Jethro Tull Website |publisher=J-tull.com |date=12 December 1946 |accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Barriemore Barlow|Barrie Barlow]], whom Anderson rechristened \"Barriemore\". Barlow had first recorded with the band for the five-track EP ''Life Is a Long Song''.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=80}} Except for Barre, the line-up of Jethro Tull now consisted entirely of former John Evan Band members from Blackpool.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=80}}\n\nAnderson had become annoyed with music critics calling ''Aqualung'' a [[concept album]], which he did not intend it to be. On a \"banter\" track that accompanies the 2005 ''Aqualung Live'' album recorded for [[XM Satellite Radio]], Anderson insisted, \"I always said at the time, this is not a concept album. It's an album of varied songs...in which three or four are kind of the keynote pieces for the album, but it doesn't make it a concept album.\"\n\nIn response to the many critics who called ''Aqualung'' a concept album, Anderson decided to \"come up with something that really is the mother of all concept albums\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=48}} He had become influenced by [[Monty Python]]'s humour, and wrote a suite that combined complex musical ideas with a sense of humour to make fun of the band, its audience and its critics.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=84,85}} The album, released in 1972, became ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'', which was co-credited to a fictional schoolboy, [[Gerald Bostock]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=48}} It consisted of a single track running over 43 minutes, split over two sides, which was uncommon for rock albums.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=113}} Although the finished album was a continuous piece of music, it was written and recorded in stages, with the whole band helping with the arrangements.{{sfn|Nollen|2002|p=83}} ''Thick as a Brick'' was the first Tull album to reach number one on the (US) Billboard Pop Albums chart{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=82}} with the following year's ''[[A Passion Play]]'' being the only other to do so.<ref>{{AllMusic |class=album|id=r10373|tab=charts-awards|label=Billboard chart info ''A Passion Play''|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jethro-Tull-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Ian Anderson and Martin Barre of Jethro Tull in Chicago, 1973]]\n\n1972 also saw the release of ''[[Living in the Past (album)|Living in the Past]]'', a double-[[compilation album|album compilation]] of remixed singles, [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s and outtakes (including the entirety of the ''Life Is a Long Song'' EP, which closes the album),{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=87}} with the third side recorded live in 1970 at New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] concert on 4 November 1970.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=67}} The album was successful, as it allowed new fans to catch up with early singles, particularly in the US where they had not been popular on initial release.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=87}} ''[[New Musical Express]]'' called Jethro Tull one of \"Britain's most important and successful 2nd generation progressive bands\".<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/nme1jul72.htm NME, 1 July, 1972]</ref>\n\nIn 1973, while in [[tax exile]], the band attempted to produce a double album at France's [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] studios, something [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Elton John]] among others were doing at the time, but supposedly they were unhappy with the quality of the recording studio and abandoned the effort, subsequently mocking the studio as the \"Chateau d'Isaster\". They returned to England, and Anderson did some rewriting before Jethro Tull quickly recorded and released ''[[A Passion Play]]'' (1973), another single-track concept album, with allegorical lyrics focusing on the afterlife. Like ''Thick as a Brick'', ''A Passion Play'' contained instrumentation rather uncommon in rock music. The album also featured an eccentric interlude, \"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\", which was co-written (along with Anderson and Evan) and narrated by bassist Hammond.  ''A Passion Play'' sold well but received generally poor reviews, including a particularly damning review of its live performance by Chris Welch of ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/mm30jun73.htm |title=Melody Maker, 30 June, 1973 |access-date=19 June 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61DN4r5MA?url=http://www.tullpress.com/mm30jun73.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEven as the band's popularity with critics began to wane around this time, their popularity with the public remained strong, as evidenced by high sales of their follow-up album, 1974's ''[[War Child (album)|War Child]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=16870 |title=\"Bungle in the Jungle by Jethro Tull\" at |publisher=Songfacts.com |date=}}</ref> Originally intended to be a companion piece for a film, it reached number two on the US [[Billboard charts]] and received some critical acclaim, and produced the radio mainstays \"[[Bungle in the Jungle]]\" (#12 on the US singles chart) and \"[[Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day]]\". It also included a short [[Acoustic music|acoustic song]], \"Only Solitaire\", widely thought to be aimed at ''L.A. Times'' rock music critic [[Robert Hilburn]], who had written a harsh review of the ''A Passion Play'' concerts at the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]]. However, Anderson said the song was written before Hilburn's review and was aimed at music critics in general. The ''War Child'' tour also featured a female [[string quartet]] playing along with the group on the new material.\n\nIn 1975, the band released ''[[Minstrel in the Gallery]]'', an album which resembled ''Aqualung'' (1971) in that it contrasted softer, acoustic-guitar-based pieces with lengthier, more bombastic works headlined by Barre's electric guitar. Written and recorded during Anderson's divorce from his first wife [[Jennie Franks]], the album is characterised by a markedly more introspective tone than their previous album, and critics gave it mixed reviews.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} By this point Jethro Tull had been awarded six [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] gold records for sales of ''Stand Up'' (1969), ''Aqualung'' (1971), ''Thick as a Brick'' (1972), ''Living in the Past'' (1972), ''A Passion Play'' (1973), and ''Minstrel in the Gallery'' (1975).{{sfn|Murrells|1978|p=295}} For the 1975 tour, [[Dee Palmer|David Palmer]], who had long been the band's orchestra arranger, officially joined the band's stage show on keyboards and synthesisers. In February 1975 Jethro Tull sold out five nights at the 20,000-seat [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Los Angeles Forum]], prompting ''Melody Maker'' to run the headline \"Jethro&nbsp;\u2013 Now The World's Biggest Band?\"<ref name=\"jethrotull.com\">{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/minstrel-in-the-gallery/ |title=Minstrel in the Gallery |publisher=Jethro Tull |date=5 September 1975}}</ref> After the tour, bassist Hammond quit the band to pursue painting. [[John Glascock]], who earlier was playing with [[flamenco]]-rock band [[Carmen (rock band)|Carmen]], a support band on the previous Jethro Tull tour, became the band's new bassist.\n\n1976's ''[[Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!]]'' was another concept album, this time about the life of an ageing rocker. Glascock made his first appearance on this album, contributing harmony and second vocals in addition to the bass lines. Palmer continued to arrange, and he recorded as a guest on two songs. For the 1976 tour, Jethro Tull became one of the first bands to use giant projection screens for the larger stadium shows.<ref name=\"jethrotull.com\"/> Although ''Too Old...'' did not sell as well as the other 1970s albums, the 1976 compilation ''[[M.U. - The Best of Jethro Tull]]'', achieved Platinum Album in US and Gold record in UK. A television special was recorded showing the development of the album's concept in a live show with the band (fully dressed in the most rock-hard-tongue-in-cheek outfits), but the programme was never officially released.\n\n===Folk rock (1977\u20131979)===\n[[File:Jethro Tull 5.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ian Anderson]] playing with Jethro Tull, [[Hammersmith Odeon]], March 1978]]\nIn the late 1970s, Jethro Tull released a trio of [[folk rock]] albums, ''[[Songs from the Wood]]'' (1977), ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978), and ''[[Stormwatch (album)|Stormwatch]]'' (1979). ''Songs from the Wood'' (1977) was the first Tull album to receive generally positive reviews since the release of ''Living in the Past'' (1972).\n\nThe band had long ties to folk rockers [[Steeleye Span]] (Tull were the backing band on Steeleye Span front woman [[Maddy Prior]]'s 1978 solo album ''[[Woman in the Wings]]'' as a way of repaying her for contributing vocals on the ''Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!'' album) and with [[Fairport Convention]] (Fairport members [[Dave Pegg]], [[Martin Allcock]], [[Dave Mattacks]] and Ric Sanders have all played with Tull at one point or another, as well as folk drummer [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]] who became a Fairport member after playing with Tull). Although not formally considered a part of the folk rock movement (which had actually begun nearly a decade earlier with the advent of [[Fairport Convention]]), there was clearly an exchange of musical ideas among Tull and the folk rockers.<ref name=\"ArtistWiki\" /> By this time, Anderson had moved to a farm in the countryside, and his new bucolic lifestyle was clearly reflected in his songwriting, as in the title track of ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978), a paean to [[Draft horse|draught horses]].\n\nThe band continued to tour, and released a live double album in 1978, titled ''[[Bursting Out]]'', which was recorded during the European leg of the ''Heavy Horses'' tour. During the US leg of this tour, John Glascock suffered health problems and was replaced by Anderson's friend and former [[Stealers Wheel]] bassist, [[Tony Williams (English musician)|Tony Williams]].\n\nTheir third folk influenced album, ''[[Stormwatch (album)|Stormwatch]]'', was released in 1979.  During the making of the album, Glascock suffered major health issues related to open heart surgery from the previous year, so Anderson played bass on much of the album.  After the release of ''Stormwatch'', due to Glascock's continued health issues, Fairport Convention bassist [[Dave Pegg]] was hired for the ensuing tour, during which Glascock died from heart complications at his home in England.<ref>\"A Tull Tale: Groovemaker in Jon Noyce\".

Different stories have been given over the years for the various reasons behind the band's restructuring, including that Barlow was depressed and withdrawn after Glascock's death and that Evan and Palmer found their futures in the band to be murky with Anderson's announcement that he wanted to work on a solo album. \nIn the 2008 Classic Artists documentary ''Jethro Tull: Their Fully Authorised Story'', Barlow claimed that he left the band on a mutual agreement with Anderson while Evan and Palmer both recalled being dismissed by a letter in the mail, with no prior contact.<ref>{{cite AV media| people = Al-Issawi, Omar (Director)| title = Jethro Tull: Their Fully Authorised Story | medium = DVD| publisher = Classic Artists| location = United Kingdom| date = 2008 }}</ref> \nFollowing their termination from Jethro Tull, Evan and Palmer briefly collaborated in a classical-based pop/rock band called Tallis.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://prod.whinc.net/tullrevision/musicians/pastmembers/johnevan.html| title=Past Members-John Evan| work=prod.whinc.net| accessdate=23 May 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230652/http://prod.whinc.net/tullrevision/musicians/pastmembers/johnevan.html| archive-date=23 May 2014| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Jethro Tull was left with Anderson (the only original member), Martin Barre and Dave Pegg.\n\nTull's first album of the 1980s was intended to be Ian Anderson's first solo album. Anderson retained Barre on electric guitar and Pegg on bass, while adding [[Mark Craney]] on drums, and special guest keyboardist/violinist [[Eddie Jobson]] (ex\u2013[[Roxy Music]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Curved Air]] and [[U.K. (band)|U.K.]], the last of which had opened for several shows on Tull's ''Stormwatch'' tour). Highlighted by the prominent use of synthesisers, it contrasted sharply with the established \"Tull sound\".  After pressure from [[Chrysalis Records]], Anderson agreed to release it as a Jethro Tull album. Entitled ''[[A (Jethro Tull album)|A]]'' (taken from the labels on the master tapes for his scrapped solo album, marked simply \"A\" for \"Anderson\"), it was released in mid-1980.\n\nIn keeping with the mood of innovation surrounding the album, Jethro Tull developed a music video titled ''[[Slipstream (video)|Slipstream]]''.<ref>[http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v26124 ''Slipstream'' at allmovie.com] Retrieved 3 September 2014.</ref> Four staged and separately filmed music videos are mixed with concert footage from the ''A'' tour. London's [[HMV Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]] was used for exterior scenes, but the main concert footage was actually from an American performance in Los Angeles, at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena|Los Angeles Sports Arena]] (as heard on the Magic Piper ROIO), filmed in November 1980. The video, released in 1981, was directed by [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]], who has directed numerous music videos, including the pioneering \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\" video for [[David Bowie]].\n\nJobson and Craney returned to their own work following the ''A'' tour and Jethro Tull entered a period of revolving drummers: [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]], who left after deciding he couldn't be the one to replace Barlow {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}, [[Phil Collins]] (as a fill-in for the recently departed Gerry Conway, played with the band at the first [[The Prince's Trust|Prince's Trust]] concert in 1982), [[Paul Burgess (musician)|Paul Burgess]] (for the US leg of the Broadsword and the Beast tour, and who left to settle down with his family) and permanent drummer [[Doane Perry]].\n\n1981 was the first year in their career that the band did not release an album; however, some recording sessions took place (Anderson, Barre, Pegg, and Conway, with Anderson playing the keyboards). Some of these tracks were released on the ''[[Nightcap (album)|Nightcap]]'' compilation in 1993.\n\nIn 1982, [[Peter-John Vettese]] joined on keyboards, and the band returned to a somewhat folkier sound\u2014albeit with synthesisers\u2014for 1982's ''[[The Broadsword and the Beast]]''. The ensuing concert tour for the album was well attended and the shows featured what was to be one of the group's last indulgences in full-dress theatricality. The stage was built to resemble a [[Longship|Viking longship]] and the band performed in faux-medieval regalia.\n\nAn Anderson solo album, which was in fact a collaborative Anderson-Vettese effort, appeared in 1983, in the form of the heavily electronic ''[[Walk into Light]]''.  As with later solo efforts by Anderson and Barre, some of the ''Walk into Light'' songs\u2014such as \"Fly by Night\", \"Made in England\" and \"Different Germany\"\u2014later made their way into Jethro Tull live sets.\n\nIn 1984, Jethro Tull released ''[[Under Wraps (Jethro Tull album)|Under Wraps]]'', a heavily electronic album with no \"live\" drummer and instead, as on ''Walk into Light'', a drum-machine was used. Although the band were reportedly proud of the sound, the album was not well received.  However, the video for \"Lap of Luxury\" did manage to earn moderate rotation on the newly influential [[MTV]] music video channel.  As a result of the throat problems Anderson developed singing the demanding ''Under Wraps'' material on tour, Jethro Tull took a three-year break. Vettese quit the band after the tour, angry at critics for the bad reviews of ''The Broadsword and the Beast'' (1982), ''Walk into Light'' (1983), and ''Under Wraps'' (1984).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.isbuc.co.uk/People/IanAnd.htm| title=Ian Anderson| author=Isle of Skye Business Community| accessdate=22 April 2007}}</ref> During this hiatus, Anderson continued to oversee the salmon farm he had founded in 1978, although the single \"Coronach\" was released in the UK in 1986 after it was used as the theme tune for a Channel 4 television program called \"Blood of the British\".\n\n===Anderson, Barre, Pegg and Perry: the \"hard rock\" Tull (1987\u20131994)===\nJethro Tull returned in 1987 with ''[[Crest of a Knave]]''. With Vettese absent (Anderson contributed the synth programming) and the band relying more heavily on Barre's electric guitar than they had since the early 1970s, the album was a critical and commercial success. Shades of their earlier electronic excursions were still present, however, as three of the album's songs again used a drum machine, with Doane Perry and Gerry Conway sharing drum duties on the other tracks. Prior to the ''Crest of a Knave'' tour, keyboardist [[Don Airey]] (ex-[[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Michael Schenker Group]]) joined the band.\n\nThe band won the 1988 [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental]], beating the favorite [[Metallica]] and their ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' album. The award was particularly controversial as many did not consider Jethro Tull hard rock, much less heavy metal. On the advice of their manager, who told them they had no chance of winning, no one from the band attended the award ceremony.<ref name=\"ArtistWiki\">{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Jethro+Tull/+wiki |title=Artist Wiki: Jethro Tull |publisher=Last.fm |date=26 November 2013}}</ref> In response to the criticism they received over the award, their label, Chrysalis, took out an advertisement in a British music periodical with a picture of a flute lying amid a pile of iron re-bar and the line, \"the flute is a heavy metal instrument.\" In response to an interview question about the controversy, Ian Anderson quipped, \"Well, we do sometimes play our mandolins very loudly.\" In 2007, the win was named one of the ten biggest upsets in Grammy history by [[Entertainment Weekly]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets| work=Entertainment Weekly| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,1567466_20010834_20010795_0,00.html| accessdate=13 February 2007}}</ref> In 1992, when Metallica finally won the Grammy in the category, Metallica drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] joked, \"First thing we're going to do is thank Jethro Tull for not putting out an album this year\", a play on a Grammy comment by [[Paul Simon]] some years before thanking [[Stevie Wonder]] for the same thing.\n\nThe style of ''[[Crest of a Knave]]'' (1987) has been compared to that of [[Dire Straits]], in part because Anderson no longer seemed to have the vocal range he once possessed and preferred to use the lower registers, while Martin Barre's guitar sound apparently drifted towards [[Mark Knopfler]]'s style. Two songs in particular\u2014\"Farm on the Freeway\" and \"Steel Monkey\"\u2014got heavy radio airplay. The album also contained the popular live song \"Budapest\", which depicts a backstage scene with a shy local female stagehand. Although \"Budapest\" was the longest song on that album (at just over ten minutes), \"Mountain Men\" became more famous in Europe, depicting a scene from World War II in Africa. Ian Anderson referred to the battles of [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], drawing historical parallels of the angst that women left behind by their warrior husbands might have felt: {{quote|died in the trenches at El Alamein,<br />died in the Falklands on TV}}\n\nThey toured this album with \"The Not Quite the World, More the Here and There Tour\". It was also the first time in the band's history that it had two electric guitar players on stage, when Anderson, albeit rarely, played rhythm guitar.\n\n1988 was notable for the release of ''[[20 Years of Jethro Tull]]'', a five-LP themed set (also released as a three-CD set, and as a truncated single CD version on ''20 Years of Jethro Tull: Highlights'') consisting largely of rarities and outtakes from throughout the band's history, as well as a variety of live and remastered tracks. It also included a booklet outlining the band's history in detail. Now out of print, it has become a collector's item, although many (but not all) of the outtakes have been included as bonus tracks on remastered releases of the band's studio albums.\n\nIn 1989, the band released ''[[Rock Island (Jethro Tull album)|Rock Island]]'', which met with less commercial and critical success than ''Crest of a Knave'' (1987). The lead-off track, \"Kissing Willie\", featured bawdy double-entendre lyrics and over-the-top heavy metal riffing that seemed to take a satiric view of the group's recent Grammy award win. The song's accompanying video found difficulty in receiving airplay because of its sexual imagery.  Although ''Rock Island'' was something of a miss for the group, a couple of fan favourites did emerge from the album. \"Big Riff and Mando\" reflects life on the road for the relentlessly touring musicians, giving a wry account of the theft of Barre's prized mandolin by a starstruck fan. \"Another Christmas Song\", an upbeat number celebrating the humanitarian spirit of the holiday season, stood out against the brooding and sombre mood of many of the songs on the album and was well received at concerts. It was re-recorded for the 2003 ''[[The Jethro Tull Christmas Album]]'' release.\n\n1991's ''[[Catfish Rising]]'' was a more solid album than ''Rock Island'' (1989). Despite being labelled as a \"return to playing the blues\", the album actually is marked by the generous use of mandolin and acoustic guitar and much less use of keyboards than any Tull album of the Eighties. Notable tracks included \"Rocks on the Road\", which highlighted gritty acoustic guitar work and hard-bitten lyrics about urban life and \"Still Loving You Tonight\", a bluesy, low-key ballad.\n\n===''Roots to Branches'' and ''J-Tull.com'': the world music influences (1995\u20132000)===\n[[File:Jethro tull - Jerusalem 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jethro Tull performing in [[Jerusalem]], 2007]]\n\nFollowing a further, semi-acoustic 1992 tour (which included [[Dave Mattacks]] but not [[Andrew Giddings|Andy Giddings]], and which was documented with ''[[A Little Light Music]]'', the band's second official live album), Anderson relearned how to play the flute (after his daughter, who took up flute classes at school, discovered that her father often used the wrong fingering)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jethro-tull.com/musicians/iananderson/equipment.html |title=Ian Anderson's Equipment&nbsp;\u2013 The Official Jethro Tull Website |publisher=Jethro-tull.com |accessdate=6 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713103527/http://jethro-tull.com/musicians/iananderson/equipment.html |archive-date=13 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and began writing songs that heavily featured world music influences. However, the first Tull releases containing the \"relearned\" flute were the 1993 ''[[25th Anniversary Box Set]]'' which, as well as the remixes of classic songs and unreleased live material, included a whole CD of old songs from the band's entire career recorded by the current line-up, and the 1993 ''[[Nightcap (album)|Nightcap]]'' compilation album containing unreleased studio material (mainly from the scrapped pre-''A Passion Play'' album), with multiple flute parts re-recorded.\n\nPrior to the recording of 1995's ''[[Roots to Branches]]'' album, longstanding bass player Dave Pegg left the band, wishing to concentrate on Fairport Convention and not being keen on the world-music direction the band chose. Doane Perry (returning as the band's full-time drummer) recruited his friend and widely respected session bass player [[Steve Bailey]] to fill the gap: Ian Anderson, in turn, relinquished control of the rhythm section arrangements on that record, leaving them completely to Bailey and Perry. Despite his studio contributions, however, Bailey did not join the band, and Pegg's formal replacement as Jethro Tull bassist was [[Jonathan Noyce]].\n\n''Roots to Branches'' (1995) and 1999's ''[[J-Tull Dot Com]]'' were less rock-based than ''Crest of a Knave'' (1987) or ''Catfish Rising'' (1991). Songs on these albums reflect the musical influences of decades of performing all around the globe. In songs such as \"Out of the Noise\" and \"Hot Mango Flush\", Anderson paints vivid pictures of third-world street scenes. These albums reflected Anderson's coming to grips with being an old rocker, with songs such as the pensive \"Another Harry's Bar\", \"Wicked Windows\" (a meditation on reading glasses), and the gruff \"Wounded, Old and Treacherous\".\n\n===Live albums, world tours and ''The Jethro Tull Christmas Album'' (2001\u20132010)===\nIn January 2002, the original lineup of the band (including Anderson, Abrahams, Cornick and Bunker) reunited for a one-off pub performance in England that was filmed for inclusion in the ''Living with the Past'' DVD.  It was the first and only time the original four members had played together since 1968, as well as the only time a former Tull lineup has ever reunited.\n\n2003 saw the release of ''[[The Jethro Tull Christmas Album]]'', a collection of traditional Christmas songs together with old and new Christmas songs written by Jethro Tull. It is the last studio album of this band. It became the band's biggest commercial success since the 1987 ''Crest of a Knave''. An Ian Anderson live double album and DVD was released in 2005 called ''[[Ian Anderson Plays the Orchestral Jethro Tull]]''. In addition, a DVD entitled ''[[Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970]]'' and a live album ''[[Aqualung Live]]'' (recorded in 2004) were released in 2005.\n\n2006 saw the release of a dual boxed set DVD ''Collector's Edition'', containing two DVDs\u2014''[[Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970]]'' and ''[[Living with the Past]]''. Bassist Jon Noyce left the band in March 2006. Keyboardist [[Andrew Giddings]] quit the band in July 2006, citing constant touring allowing not enough time for family. They were replaced by [[David Goodier]] and [[John O'Hara (musician)|John O'Hara]] respectively. In the following year ''[[The Best of Acoustic Jethro Tull]]'', a 24-song set of Tull's and Ian Anderson's acoustic performances taken from various albums, was released. Included are a new live acoustic version of \"One Brown Mouse\" and a live performance of the traditional song (attributed to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]), \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\".\n\nIn September 2007, Jethro Tull released CD/DVD ''[[Live at Montreux 2003 (Jethro Tull album)|Live at Montreux 2003]]''. The concert was recorded on 4 July 2003 and featured, among others, \"Fat Man\", \"With You There to Help Me\" and \"Hunting Girl\", with the longest unchanged line-up: Anderson, Barre, Perry, Noyce and Giddings.\n\nIn February 2010, the band were commemorated with a [[Heritage Award]] by [[PRS for Music]]. A plaque was erected on a Catholic church in [[Blackpool]], where the band performed their first ever gig.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lancashire/8536951.stm |work=BBC News | title=Jethro Tull's church gig honoured | date=25 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Anderson and Barre go solo and the end of Jethro Tull (2011\u20132012)===\n2011 marked the 40th Anniversary of ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' (1971). A new re-issue was released with new remix of the album (by [[Porcupine Tree]]'s [[Steven Wilson]]) and include a DVD and unreleased songs.\n\nDuring interviews in November 2011, Martin Barre stated that there were no current plans for future Jethro Tull work. In 2012, Barre assembled and toured with a group, billed as Martin Barre's New Day, which included Jonathan Noyce that played mostly Tull material.<ref name=\"crr\">{{cite web | url=http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviewmartinbarre2011.htm | title=Forty years of Aqualung: An interview with Jethro Tull's Martin Barre | accessdate=25 November 2011 | author=Wright, Jeb | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123173724/http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviewmartinbarre2011.htm | archive-date=23 November 2011 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=22 November 2011|work=Classic Rock Revisited|title=Interview with Martin Barre}}</ref> In 2015, Barre stated \"It's important that people realize there will never be a Jethro Tull again.

This will be followed by tours in the UK and US, during which the album will be played in its entirety. ''Homo Erraticus'' will be a prog-rock concept album which, according to Anderson, \"chronicles the weird imaginings of one Ernest T. Parritt, as recaptured by the now middle-aged Gerald Bostock after a trip to Mathew Bunter's Old Library Bookshop in Linwell village. Bostock and Bunter came across this dusty, unpublished manuscript, written by local amateur historian Ernest T. Parritt, (1873\u20131928), and entitled Homo Britanicus Erraticus.\" Like ''Thick as a Brick 2'', ''Homo Erraticus'' is billed as an Ian Anderson solo album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/homo-erraticus-the-new-studio-album-from-ian-anderson/ | title=Homo Eratticus&nbsp;\u2013 The New Studio Album From Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson |accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn an April 2014 interview following the release of Anderson's solo album ''Homo Erraticus'', Anderson announced that from that point on, he would be releasing all his music under his own name. Anderson stated that Tull \"kind of came more or less to an end during the last 10 years or so\", and stated his preference \"in my twilight years, to use my own name for the most part being composer of virtually all Tull songs and music since 1968\".<ref name=\"billboard end\"/><ref name=\"billboard end\"/> In the liner notes Anderson explains that he will continue to operate under his own name.\n\n2015 saw Anderson tour with the ''Ian Anderson Touring Band'' and the project ''Jethro Tull&nbsp;\u2013 The Rock Opera''; a lyrically modified Tull repertoire and new rock songs about the namesake of the band, Jethro Tull, together with elaborate video productions to the stage.

Please do not change \"are\" to \"is\". --> a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Blackpool]], Lancashire, in 1967. Initially playing [[blues rock]] and [[jazz fusion]], the band later developed their sound to incorporate elements of [[hard rock]] and [[folk music|folk]] to forge a [[progressive rock]] signature.<ref>{{cite web|last=Eder |first=Bruce |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jethro-tull-p4610 |title=Jethro Tull |website=AllMusic |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> The band is led by vocalist/flautist/guitarist [[Ian Anderson]], and has featured a revolving door of lineups through the years including significant members such as guitarists [[Mick Abrahams]] and [[Martin Barre]], keyboardists [[John Evan]] and [[Dee Palmer]], drummers [[Clive Bunker]], [[Barriemore Barlow]], and [[Doane Perry]], and bassists [[Glenn Cornick]], [[Jeffrey Hammond]], [[John Glascock]], and [[Dave Pegg]].\n\nThe group first achieved commercial success in 1969, with the folk-tinged electric blues album ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'', which reached No. 1 in the UK, and they toured regularly in the UK and the US. Their musical style shifted in the direction of progressive rock with the albums ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' (1971), ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Passion Play]]'' (1973), and shifted again to hard rock mixed with [[folk rock]] with ''[[Songs from the Wood]]'' (1977) and ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978). After an excursion into [[electronic rock]] in the early-to-mid 1980s, the band won its sole [[Grammy Award]] with the 1987 album ''[[Crest of a Knave]]''. Jethro Tull have sold an estimated 60&nbsp;million albums worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/ian-andersons-homo-erraticus-to-be-released-on-14th-april/ |title=Ian Anderson's 'Homo Erraticus' to be released on 14 April |publisher=Official Jethro Tull website |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref> with 11 gold and five platinum albums among them.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/304588/jethro-tull/biography |title=Jethro Tull&nbsp;\u2013 Biography |magazine=Billboard.com |accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> They have been described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as \"one of the most commercially successful and eccentric progressive rock bands\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/jethro-tull/biography |title=Jethro Tull Biography |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe last works as a group to contain new material were released in 2003, though the band continued to tour until 2011.

The compilation ''[[50 for 50]]'' was released in 2018.\n\nThe reformed group\u2014now billed as \"Ian Anderson and the Jethro Tull band\"\u2014still performs live, and has announced tour dates into 2020.  The current band line-up includes musicians who have been members of Anderson's solo band since 2012.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[Ian Anderson]], [[Jeffrey Hammond]] and [[John Evan]] (originally Evans), who would become members of Jethro Tull, attended [[grammar school]] together in [[Blackpool]]. Anderson was born in [[Dunfermline]], [[Scotland]] and grew up in [[Edinburgh]] before moving to Blackpool in January 1960.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=4}} Evans had become a fan of [[the Beatles]] after seeing them play \"[[Love Me Do]]\" on [[Granada Television]]'s ''Scene at 6:30''. Though he was an accomplished pianist, he decided to take up the drums, as it was an instrument featured in the Beatles' line-up.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=5\u20136}} Anderson had acquired a [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]] and taught himself how to play it, and the pair decided to form a band.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=7}} The pair recruited Hammond on bass, who brought along his collection of [[blues music|blues]] records to listen to.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=8}}\n\nThe group initially played as a three piece at local clubs and venues, before Evans became influenced by [[Georgie Fame]] and [[the Animals]] and switched to organ, recruiting drummer [[Barriemore Barlow|Barrie Barlow]]{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=14\u201315}} and guitarist Mike Stephens from local band the Atlantics.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=12}}{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=12}} By 1964 the band had recruited guitarist Chris Riley{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=12}} and developed into a six-piece [[blue-eyed soul]] band called the John Evan Band (later the John Evan Smash). Evans had shortened his surname to \"Evan\" at the insistence of Hammond, who thought it sounded better and more unusual. The group recruited Johnny Taylor as a booking agent and played gigs further afield around northwest England,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=15}} playing a mixture of blues and [[Motown]] covers.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=14}} Hammond subsequently quit the band to go to [[art school]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=15}} He was briefly replaced by Derek Ward, then by [[Glenn Cornick]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=17}} Riley also quit and was replaced by Neil Smith.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=17}} The group recorded three songs at Regent Sound Studios in [[Denmark Street]], London in April 1967, and appeared at [[The Marquee]] club in June.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=27}}\n\nIn November 1967, the band moved to the London area, basing themselves in [[Luton]]. They signed a management deal with Terry Ellis and Chris Wright and replaced Smith with guitarist [[Mick Abrahams]],{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=19}} but quickly realised that supporting a 6-piece band was financially impractical, and the group split up. Anderson, Abrahams and Cornick decided to stay together, recruiting Abrahams' friend [[Clive Bunker]] on drums{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=18}} and becoming a [[British blues]] band.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=26}} Cornick recalled that although Evan left, the band said he was welcome to rejoin at a later date.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=27}} Anderson shared a ground-floor flat with Cornick in a large house at the top of Studley Road in Luton,<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/zzjul76.htm Zigzag, July 1976]</ref> and worked as a cleaner for the Luton Ritz Cinema to pay the rent.<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/bbc79a.htm BBC Radio interview, March 1979]</ref> According to Cornick, \"we were so poor that we would share one can of stew or soup between us each evening.\" <ref>[https://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2011/12/glenn-cornick-interview-about-jethro.html Psychedelic Baby Magazine, 13 December 2011] Retrieved 22 September 2019</ref>\n\n===Early years (1967\u20131968)===\nAt first, the new band had trouble getting repeat bookings and they took to changing their name frequently to continue playing the London club circuit, names which included \"Navy Blue\", \"Ian Henderson's Bag o' Nails\", and \"Candy Coloured Rain\". Anderson recalled looking at a poster at a club and concluding that the band name he didn't recognise was his.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=22}} Band names were often supplied by their booking agents' staff, one of whom, a history enthusiast, eventually christened them \"Jethro Tull\" after [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|the 18th-century agriculturist]]. The name stuck because they happened to be using it the first time a club manager liked their show enough to invite them to return.<ref name=\"billboard end\"/> They recorded a session with producer [[Derek Lawrence]], which resulted in the single \"Sunshine Day\". The B-side \"Aeroplane\" was an old John Evan Band track with the saxophones mixed out. It was released in February 1968 on [[MGM Records]], miscredited to \"Jethro Toe\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=23\u201323}} Anderson has since questioned the misnomer as a way to avoid paying royalties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austindaze.com/2006/08/29/jethro-tull-ian-anderson/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108173613/http://www.austindaze.com/2006/08/29/jethro-tull-ian-anderson/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 November 2011 |title=Jethro Tull (Ian Anderson) |publisher=Austin Daze |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref> The more common version, with the name spelled correctly, is actually a [[counterfeit]] made in New York.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dag Sandbu |url=http://www.collecting-tull.com/Collectibles/7_JethroToe.htm |title=MGM Jethro Toe |publisher=Collecting-tull.com |accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> Anderson later met Hammond while in London and the two renewed their friendship, while Anderson moved into a [[bedsit]] in Chelsea with Evan.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=35}} Hammond became the subject of several songs, beginning with their next single, \"A Song for Jeffrey\".{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=36}}\n\nAnderson possessed a large [[overcoat]], his father having given it to him with the words \"You'd better take this. It's going to be a cold winter\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Ballad of Jethro Tull |date=2019 |publisher=Rocket 88 |location=London |isbn=9781910978429 |page=25}}</ref> This overcoat, and slightly later on the flute, became part of his early stage image. It was around this time that Anderson purchased a flute after becoming frustrated with his inability to play guitar as well as Abrahams, and because their managers thought he should remain a rhythm guitarist, with Abrahams becoming the front man.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=24}} \n\n<blockquote>I didn't want to be just another third-rate guitar player who sounded like a bunch of other third-rate guitar players. I wanted to do something that was a bit more idiosyncratic, hence the switch to another instrument. When Jethro Tull began, I think I'd been playing the flute for about two weeks. It was a quick learning curve&nbsp;... literally every night I walked onstage was a flute lesson.<ref name=\"Newsome\">Newsome, Jim. \"Living in the Present\". Interview with Ian Anderson, 23 April 2002. [http://www.jimnewsom.com/IanAndersonInterview.html jimnewsom.com]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe group's first major break occurred at the [[National Jazz and Blues Festival]] at [[Sunbury-on-Thames]] in August 1968, where the band drew a rapturous reception and positive reviews in the music press. The band have since claimed that the success at Sunbury was a result of their persistent touring, which had generated a grassroots following who had all assembled at the festival and encouraged the rest of the audience. Cornick recalled, \"from that moment on, we were a big band\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe group recorded their first album, ''[[This Was]]'', between June and August 1968, and it was released in October, reaching number 10 in the charts.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=41,42}} In addition to original material, the album included the traditional \"Cat's Squirrel\", which highlighted Abrahams' blues-rock style, while the [[Rahsaan Roland Kirk]]-penned jazz piece \"Serenade to a Cuckoo\" gave Anderson a showcase for his growing talents on the flute.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=42}} The overall sound of the group at this time was described in the ''[[Record Mirror]]'' by Anderson in 1968 as \"a sort of progressive blues with a bit of jazz\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/rm12oct68.htm |title=Record Mirror, 12 October, 1968 |access-date=11 February 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61DN3yU3K?url=http://www.tullpress.com/rm12oct68.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the album's release, Abrahams left the band in December to form his own group, [[Blodwyn Pig]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=43}} There were a number of reasons given for his departure. Abrahams had heard that Ellis wanted Anderson to be the frontman and group leader, at his expense, and realised he was unlikely to have the majority share in songwriting.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=37}} Other reasons given were that Abrahams was a blues purist while Anderson wanted to branch out into other forms of music, and that Abrahams was unwilling to travel internationally or play more than three nights a week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themarqueeclub.net/jethro-tull |title=Jethro Tull biography at themarquee.net |publisher=Themarqueeclub.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175356/http://www.themarqueeclub.net/jethro-tull |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.squirrelmusic.com/ |title=Mick's Bio at Mick Abrahams' official website |publisher=Squirrelmusic.com |date=}}</ref> Abrahams himself described his reasons more succinctly: \"I was fed up with all the nonsense, and I wanted to form a band like Blodwyn Pig.\"<ref>Rock Guitar Daily blog. [rockguitardaily.blogspot.com/mick-abrahams]</ref>\n\nThe group tried several replacements for Abrahams. The first was [[David O'List]], who had recently left [[the Nice]]. After a week's rehearsal, O'List didn't show up and lost contact with the group. The next choice was [[Mick Taylor]], who turned the group down because he felt his current gig with [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]] was a better deal.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=43}} Following this, the group put an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' which was answered by [[Tony Iommi]]. After a few rehearsals, the group appeared in ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' on 11 December. The group performed \"A Song for Jeffrey\", but only Anderson's singing and flute were live; the rest was [[mime]]d. Iommi felt closer to his old band, 'Earth' (now known as Black Sabbath), so he returned to Birmingham to rejoin them. \n\nThe next choice was [[Martin Barre]], who had seen the band perform at Sunbury,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=47}} and had been tried out at the same audition as Iommi. Barre arranged a second audition with Anderson, who showed him some new songs that were in a different style to the blues they had been recording. Anderson was impressed by Barre's technique, and offered him the job as the new guitarist.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=44}} Barre played his first gig with Jethro Tull on 30 December 1968 at the Winter Gardens, Penzance.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=30}}\n\n===''Stand Up'' through ''Aqualung'' (1969\u20131971)===\nAfter Barre joined, the group did a few shows supporting [[Jimi Hendrix]] in Scandinavia,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=49}} then set out on an extensive tour of the US, supporting [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Vanilla Fudge]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=31}} Having attracted a substantial live following, Ellis and Wright asked Anderson, who had become the dominant songwriter, to write a hit single. The result was \"[[Living in the Past (song)|Living in the Past]]\", which reached No. 3 in May on the UK singles chart and No. 11 in the US,{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=31}} and resulted in an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. Although other so-called \"serious\" groups actively resisted issuing stand-alone singles at the time, Jethro Tull felt a hit single was a positive move for the group, if not their priority.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=32}}\n\n[[File:Jethro-Tull-9-73(2).jpg|thumb|140px|[[John Evan]], an old schoolfriend and bandmate, joined the band in April 1970, after several invitations to do so]]\nThe next album was ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'', recorded during April\u2013May and August 1969.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=52}} It was released in September, and quickly reached No. 1 in the UK charts, the only album by the group to do so. Anderson had now established himself as the group's leader and songwriter, and wrote all of the material, aside from his jazzy rearrangement of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]'s \"[[Bourr\u00e9e in E minor]] BWV 996 (fifth movement)\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=32}} The album cover unfolded to a photo insert of the band attached to the covers like a [[pop-up book]].\n\nImmediately after releasing ''Stand Up'', the group set off on their first headlining tour in the US, including an appearance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=33}} Barre recalled, \"It was really the turning point for Jethro Tull\u2014for everything that we were to become and everything we were to inspire in others.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/gwjun99.htm |title=Guitar World, June, 1999 |access-date=17 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311053104/http://www.tullpress.com/gwjun99.htm |archive-date=11 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band was invited to play in the [[Woodstock 1969|Woodstock Festival]], but Anderson declined, being afraid that the band would be permanently typecast as [[hippie]]s, able to play only one musical style.<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/craug01.htm Classic Rock, August, 2001]</ref>\n\nOn 29 January 1970 the band appeared on BBC's ''Top of the Pops'' again, performing \"Witch's Promise\".<ref>{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/top-of-the-pops-uk/29th-january-1970-943665/ |title=Top of the Pops (UK)&nbsp;\u2013 Season 7, Episode 5: 29th January 1970 |publisher=TV.com |date= |accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{youtube|-0GAuexrVzo|Jethro Tull&nbsp;\u2013 The Witches Promise}}</ref> Evan rejoined the band in early 1970.

The album was split into two sides, subtitled 'Aqualung' and 'My God', and featured Anderson's opinions about organised religion.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=76}} Recording the album was problematic because of technical issues in the studio and Hammond's rusty musical skills.

On a \"banter\" track that accompanies the 2005 ''Aqualung Live'' album recorded for [[XM Satellite Radio]], Anderson insisted, \"I always said at the time, this is not a concept album. It's an album of varied songs...in which three or four are kind of the keynote pieces for the album, but it doesn't make it a concept album.\"\n\nIn response to the many critics who called ''Aqualung'' a concept album, Anderson decided to \"come up with something that really is the mother of all concept albums\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=48}} He had become influenced by [[Monty Python]]'s humour, and wrote a suite that combined complex musical ideas with a sense of humour to make fun of the band, its audience and its critics.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=84,85}} The album, released in 1972, became ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'', which was co-credited to a fictional schoolboy, [[Gerald Bostock]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=48}} It consisted of a single track running over 43 minutes, split over two sides, which was uncommon for rock albums.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=113}} Although the finished album was a continuous piece of music, it was written and recorded in stages, with the whole band helping with the arrangements.{{sfn|Nollen|2002|p=83}} ''Thick as a Brick'' was the first Tull album to reach number one on the (US) Billboard Pop Albums chart{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=82}} with the following year's ''[[A Passion Play]]'' being the only other to do so.<ref>{{AllMusic |class=album|id=r10373|tab=charts-awards|label=Billboard chart info ''A Passion Play''|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jethro-Tull-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Ian Anderson and Martin Barre of Jethro Tull in Chicago, 1973]]\n\n1972 also saw the release of ''[[Living in the Past (album)|Living in the Past]]'', a double-[[compilation album|album compilation]] of remixed singles, [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s and outtakes (including the entirety of the ''Life Is a Long Song'' EP, which closes the album),{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=87}} with the third side recorded live in 1970 at New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] concert on 4 November 1970.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=67}} The album was successful, as it allowed new fans to catch up with early singles, particularly in the US where they had not been popular on initial release.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=87}} ''[[New Musical Express]]'' called Jethro Tull one of \"Britain's most important and successful 2nd generation progressive bands\".<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/nme1jul72.htm NME, 1 July, 1972]</ref>\n\nIn 1973, while in [[tax exile]], the band attempted to produce a double album at France's [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] studios, something [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Elton John]] among others were doing at the time, but supposedly they were unhappy with the quality of the recording studio and abandoned the effort, subsequently mocking the studio as the \"Chateau d'Isaster\". They returned to England, and Anderson did some rewriting before Jethro Tull quickly recorded and released ''[[A Passion Play]]'' (1973), another single-track concept album, with allegorical lyrics focusing on the afterlife. Like ''Thick as a Brick'', ''A Passion Play'' contained instrumentation rather uncommon in rock music. The album also featured an eccentric interlude, \"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\", which was co-written (along with Anderson and Evan) and narrated by bassist Hammond.  ''A Passion Play'' sold well but received generally poor reviews, including a particularly damning review of its live performance by Chris Welch of ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/mm30jun73.htm |title=Melody Maker, 30 June, 1973 |access-date=19 June 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61DN4r5MA?url=http://www.tullpress.com/mm30jun73.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEven as the band's popularity with critics began to wane around this time, their popularity with the public remained strong, as evidenced by high sales of their follow-up album, 1974's ''[[War Child (album)|War Child]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=16870 |title=\"Bungle in the Jungle by Jethro Tull\" at |publisher=Songfacts.com |date=}}</ref> Originally intended to be a companion piece for a film, it reached number two on the US [[Billboard charts]] and received some critical acclaim, and produced the radio mainstays \"[[Bungle in the Jungle]]\" (#12 on the US singles chart) and \"[[Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day]]\". It also included a short [[Acoustic music|acoustic song]], \"Only Solitaire\", widely thought to be aimed at ''L.A. Times'' rock music critic [[Robert Hilburn]], who had written a harsh review of the ''A Passion Play'' concerts at the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]]. However, Anderson said the song was written before Hilburn's review and was aimed at music critics in general. The ''War Child'' tour also featured a female [[string quartet]] playing along with the group on the new material.\n\nIn 1975, the band released ''[[Minstrel in the Gallery]]'', an album which resembled ''Aqualung'' (1971) in that it contrasted softer, acoustic-guitar-based pieces with lengthier, more bombastic works headlined by Barre's electric guitar. Written and recorded during Anderson's divorce from his first wife [[Jennie Franks]], the album is characterised by a markedly more introspective tone than their previous album, and critics gave it mixed reviews.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} By this point Jethro Tull had been awarded six [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] gold records for sales of ''Stand Up'' (1969), ''Aqualung'' (1971), ''Thick as a Brick'' (1972), ''Living in the Past'' (1972), ''A Passion Play'' (1973), and ''Minstrel in the Gallery'' (1975).{{sfn|Murrells|1978|p=295}} For the 1975 tour, [[Dee Palmer|David Palmer]], who had long been the band's orchestra arranger, officially joined the band's stage show on keyboards and synthesisers. In February 1975 Jethro Tull sold out five nights at the 20,000-seat [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Los Angeles Forum]], prompting ''Melody Maker'' to run the headline \"Jethro&nbsp;\u2013 Now The World's Biggest Band?\"<ref name=\"jethrotull.com\">{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/minstrel-in-the-gallery/ |title=Minstrel in the Gallery |publisher=Jethro Tull |date=5 September 1975}}</ref> After the tour, bassist Hammond quit the band to pursue painting. [[John Glascock]], who earlier was playing with [[flamenco]]-rock band [[Carmen (rock band)|Carmen]], a support band on the previous Jethro Tull tour, became the band's new bassist.\n\n1976's ''[[Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!]]'' was another concept album, this time about the life of an ageing rocker. Glascock made his first appearance on this album, contributing harmony and second vocals in addition to the bass lines. Palmer continued to arrange, and he recorded as a guest on two songs. For the 1976 tour, Jethro Tull became one of the first bands to use giant projection screens for the larger stadium shows.<ref name=\"jethrotull.com\"/> Although ''Too Old...'' did not sell as well as the other 1970s albums, the 1976 compilation ''[[M.U. - The Best of Jethro Tull]]'', achieved Platinum Album in US and Gold record in UK. A television special was recorded showing the development of the album's concept in a live show with the band (fully dressed in the most rock-hard-tongue-in-cheek outfits), but the programme was never officially released.\n\n===Folk rock (1977\u20131979)===\n[[File:Jethro Tull 5.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ian Anderson]] playing with Jethro Tull, [[Hammersmith Odeon]], March 1978]]\nIn the late 1970s, Jethro Tull released a trio of [[folk rock]] albums, ''[[Songs from the Wood]]'' (1977), ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978), and ''[[Stormwatch (album)|Stormwatch]]'' (1979). ''Songs from the Wood'' (1977) was the first Tull album to receive generally positive reviews since the release of ''Living in the Past'' (1972).\n\nThe band had long ties to folk rockers [[Steeleye Span]] (Tull were the backing band on Steeleye Span front woman [[Maddy Prior]]'s 1978 solo album ''[[Woman in the Wings]]'' as a way of repaying her for contributing vocals on the ''Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!'' album) and with [[Fairport Convention]] (Fairport members [[Dave Pegg]], [[Martin Allcock]], [[Dave Mattacks]] and Ric Sanders have all played with Tull at one point or another, as well as folk drummer [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]] who became a Fairport member after playing with Tull). Although not formally considered a part of the folk rock movement (which had actually begun nearly a decade earlier with the advent of [[Fairport Convention]]), there was clearly an exchange of musical ideas among Tull and the folk rockers.<ref name=\"ArtistWiki\" /> By this time, Anderson had moved to a farm in the countryside, and his new bucolic lifestyle was clearly reflected in his songwriting, as in the title track of ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978), a paean to [[Draft horse|draught horses]].\n\nThe band continued to tour, and released a live double album in 1978, titled ''[[Bursting Out]]'', which was recorded during the European leg of the ''Heavy Horses'' tour. During the US leg of this tour, John Glascock suffered health problems and was replaced by Anderson's friend and former [[Stealers Wheel]] bassist, [[Tony Williams (English musician)|Tony Williams]].\n\nTheir third folk influenced album, ''[[Stormwatch (album)|Stormwatch]]'', was released in 1979.  During the making of the album, Glascock suffered major health issues related to open heart surgery from the previous year, so Anderson played bass on much of the album.  After the release of ''Stormwatch'', due to Glascock's continued health issues, Fairport Convention bassist [[Dave Pegg]] was hired for the ensuing tour, during which Glascock died from heart complications at his home in England.<ref>\"A Tull Tale: Groovemaker in Jon Noyce\".

Different stories have been given over the years for the various reasons behind the band's restructuring, including that Barlow was depressed and withdrawn after Glascock's death and that Evan and Palmer found their futures in the band to be murky with Anderson's announcement that he wanted to work on a solo album. \nIn the 2008 Classic Artists documentary ''Jethro Tull: Their Fully Authorised Story'', Barlow claimed that he left the band on a mutual agreement with Anderson while Evan and Palmer both recalled being dismissed by a letter in the mail, with no prior contact.<ref>{{cite AV media| people = Al-Issawi, Omar (Director)| title = Jethro Tull: Their Fully Authorised Story | medium = DVD| publisher = Classic Artists| location = United Kingdom| date = 2008 }}</ref> \nFollowing their termination from Jethro Tull, Evan and Palmer briefly collaborated in a classical-based pop/rock band called Tallis.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://prod.whinc.net/tullrevision/musicians/pastmembers/johnevan.html| title=Past Members-John Evan| work=prod.whinc.net| accessdate=23 May 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230652/http://prod.whinc.net/tullrevision/musicians/pastmembers/johnevan.html| archive-date=23 May 2014| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Jethro Tull was left with Anderson (the only original member), Martin Barre and Dave Pegg.\n\nTull's first album of the 1980s was intended to be Ian Anderson's first solo album. Anderson retained Barre on electric guitar and Pegg on bass, while adding [[Mark Craney]] on drums, and special guest keyboardist/violinist [[Eddie Jobson]] (ex\u2013[[Roxy Music]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Curved Air]] and [[U.K. (band)|U.K.]], the last of which had opened for several shows on Tull's ''Stormwatch'' tour). Highlighted by the prominent use of synthesisers, it contrasted sharply with the established \"Tull sound\".  After pressure from [[Chrysalis Records]], Anderson agreed to release it as a Jethro Tull album. Entitled ''[[A (Jethro Tull album)|A]]'' (taken from the labels on the master tapes for his scrapped solo album, marked simply \"A\" for \"Anderson\"), it was released in mid-1980.\n\nIn keeping with the mood of innovation surrounding the album, Jethro Tull developed a music video titled ''[[Slipstream (video)|Slipstream]]''.<ref>[http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v26124 ''Slipstream'' at allmovie.com] Retrieved 3 September 2014.</ref> Four staged and separately filmed music videos are mixed with concert footage from the ''A'' tour. London's [[HMV Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]] was used for exterior scenes, but the main concert footage was actually from an American performance in Los Angeles, at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena|Los Angeles Sports Arena]] (as heard on the Magic Piper ROIO), filmed in November 1980. The video, released in 1981, was directed by [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]], who has directed numerous music videos, including the pioneering \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\" video for [[David Bowie]].\n\nJobson and Craney returned to their own work following the ''A'' tour and Jethro Tull entered a period of revolving drummers: [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]], who left after deciding he couldn't be the one to replace Barlow {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}, [[Phil Collins]] (as a fill-in for the recently departed Gerry Conway, played with the band at the first [[The Prince's Trust|Prince's Trust]] concert in 1982), [[Paul Burgess (musician)|Paul Burgess]] (for the US leg of the Broadsword and the Beast tour, and who left to settle down with his family) and permanent drummer [[Doane Perry]].\n\n1981 was the first year in their career that the band did not release an album; however, some recording sessions took place (Anderson, Barre, Pegg, and Conway, with Anderson playing the keyboards). Some of these tracks were released on the ''[[Nightcap (album)|Nightcap]]'' compilation in 1993.\n\nIn 1982, [[Peter-John Vettese]] joined on keyboards, and the band returned to a somewhat folkier sound\u2014albeit with synthesisers\u2014for 1982's ''[[The Broadsword and the Beast]]''. The ensuing concert tour for the album was well attended and the shows featured what was to be one of the group's last indulgences in full-dress theatricality. The stage was built to resemble a [[Longship|Viking longship]] and the band performed in faux-medieval regalia.\n\nAn Anderson solo album, which was in fact a collaborative Anderson-Vettese effort, appeared in 1983, in the form of the heavily electronic ''[[Walk into Light]]''.  As with later solo efforts by Anderson and Barre, some of the ''Walk into Light'' songs\u2014such as \"Fly by Night\", \"Made in England\" and \"Different Germany\"\u2014later made their way into Jethro Tull live sets.\n\nIn 1984, Jethro Tull released ''[[Under Wraps (Jethro Tull album)|Under Wraps]]'', a heavily electronic album with no \"live\" drummer and instead, as on ''Walk into Light'', a drum-machine was used. Although the band were reportedly proud of the sound, the album was not well received.  However, the video for \"Lap of Luxury\" did manage to earn moderate rotation on the newly influential [[MTV]] music video channel.  As a result of the throat problems Anderson developed singing the demanding ''Under Wraps'' material on tour, Jethro Tull took a three-year break. Vettese quit the band after the tour, angry at critics for the bad reviews of ''The Broadsword and the Beast'' (1982), ''Walk into Light'' (1983), and ''Under Wraps'' (1984).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.isbuc.co.uk/People/IanAnd.htm| title=Ian Anderson| author=Isle of Skye Business Community| accessdate=22 April 2007}}</ref> During this hiatus, Anderson continued to oversee the salmon farm he had founded in 1978, although the single \"Coronach\" was released in the UK in 1986 after it was used as the theme tune for a Channel 4 television program called \"Blood of the British\".\n\n===Anderson, Barre, Pegg and Perry: the \"hard rock\" Tull (1987\u20131994)===\nJethro Tull returned in 1987 with ''[[Crest of a Knave]]''. With Vettese absent (Anderson contributed the synth programming) and the band relying more heavily on Barre's electric guitar than they had since the early 1970s, the album was a critical and commercial success. Shades of their earlier electronic excursions were still present, however, as three of the album's songs again used a drum machine, with Doane Perry and Gerry Conway sharing drum duties on the other tracks. Prior to the ''Crest of a Knave'' tour, keyboardist [[Don Airey]] (ex-[[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Michael Schenker Group]]) joined the band.\n\nThe band won the 1988 [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental]], beating the favorite [[Metallica]] and their ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' album. The award was particularly controversial as many did not consider Jethro Tull hard rock, much less heavy metal. On the advice of their manager, who told them they had no chance of winning, no one from the band attended the award ceremony.<ref name=\"ArtistWiki\">{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Jethro+Tull/+wiki |title=Artist Wiki: Jethro Tull |publisher=Last.fm |date=26 November 2013}}</ref> In response to the criticism they received over the award, their label, Chrysalis, took out an advertisement in a British music periodical with a picture of a flute lying amid a pile of iron re-bar and the line, \"the flute is a heavy metal instrument.\" In response to an interview question about the controversy, Ian Anderson quipped, \"Well, we do sometimes play our mandolins very loudly.\" In 2007, the win was named one of the ten biggest upsets in Grammy history by [[Entertainment Weekly]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets| work=Entertainment Weekly| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,1567466_20010834_20010795_0,00.html| accessdate=13 February 2007}}</ref> In 1992, when Metallica finally won the Grammy in the category, Metallica drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] joked, \"First thing we're going to do is thank Jethro Tull for not putting out an album this year\", a play on a Grammy comment by [[Paul Simon]] some years before thanking [[Stevie Wonder]] for the same thing.\n\nThe style of ''[[Crest of a Knave]]'' (1987) has been compared to that of [[Dire Straits]], in part because Anderson no longer seemed to have the vocal range he once possessed and preferred to use the lower registers, while Martin Barre's guitar sound apparently drifted towards [[Mark Knopfler]]'s style. Two songs in particular\u2014\"Farm on the Freeway\" and \"Steel Monkey\"\u2014got heavy radio airplay. The album also contained the popular live song \"Budapest\", which depicts a backstage scene with a shy local female stagehand. Although \"Budapest\" was the longest song on that album (at just over ten minutes), \"Mountain Men\" became more famous in Europe, depicting a scene from World War II in Africa. Ian Anderson referred to the battles of [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], drawing historical parallels of the angst that women left behind by their warrior husbands might have felt: {{quote|died in the trenches at El Alamein,<br />died in the Falklands on TV}}\n\nThey toured this album with \"The Not Quite the World, More the Here and There Tour\". It was also the first time in the band's history that it had two electric guitar players on stage, when Anderson, albeit rarely, played rhythm guitar.\n\n1988 was notable for the release of ''[[20 Years of Jethro Tull]]'', a five-LP themed set (also released as a three-CD set, and as a truncated single CD version on ''20 Years of Jethro Tull: Highlights'') consisting largely of rarities and outtakes from throughout the band's history, as well as a variety of live and remastered tracks. It also included a booklet outlining the band's history in detail. Now out of print, it has become a collector's item, although many (but not all) of the outtakes have been included as bonus tracks on remastered releases of the band's studio albums.\n\nIn 1989, the band released ''[[Rock Island (Jethro Tull album)|Rock Island]]'', which met with less commercial and critical success than ''Crest of a Knave'' (1987). The lead-off track, \"Kissing Willie\", featured bawdy double-entendre lyrics and over-the-top heavy metal riffing that seemed to take a satiric view of the group's recent Grammy award win. The song's accompanying video found difficulty in receiving airplay because of its sexual imagery.  Although ''Rock Island'' was something of a miss for the group, a couple of fan favourites did emerge from the album. \"Big Riff and Mando\" reflects life on the road for the relentlessly touring musicians, giving a wry account of the theft of Barre's prized mandolin by a starstruck fan. \"Another Christmas Song\", an upbeat number celebrating the humanitarian spirit of the holiday season, stood out against the brooding and sombre mood of many of the songs on the album and was well received at concerts. It was re-recorded for the 2003 ''[[The Jethro Tull Christmas Album]]'' release.\n\n1991's ''[[Catfish Rising]]'' was a more solid album than ''Rock Island'' (1989). Despite being labelled as a \"return to playing the blues\", the album actually is marked by the generous use of mandolin and acoustic guitar and much less use of keyboards than any Tull album of the Eighties. Notable tracks included \"Rocks on the Road\", which highlighted gritty acoustic guitar work and hard-bitten lyrics about urban life and \"Still Loving You Tonight\", a bluesy, low-key ballad.\n\n===''Roots to Branches'' and ''J-Tull.com'': the world music influences (1995\u20132000)===\n[[File:Jethro tull - Jerusalem 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jethro Tull performing in [[Jerusalem]], 2007]]\n\nFollowing a further, semi-acoustic 1992 tour (which included [[Dave Mattacks]] but not [[Andrew Giddings|Andy Giddings]], and which was documented with ''[[A Little Light Music]]'', the band's second official live album), Anderson relearned how to play the flute (after his daughter, who took up flute classes at school, discovered that her father often used the wrong fingering)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jethro-tull.com/musicians/iananderson/equipment.html |title=Ian Anderson's Equipment&nbsp;\u2013 The Official Jethro Tull Website |publisher=Jethro-tull.com |accessdate=6 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713103527/http://jethro-tull.com/musicians/iananderson/equipment.html |archive-date=13 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and began writing songs that heavily featured world music influences. However, the first Tull releases containing the \"relearned\" flute were the 1993 ''[[25th Anniversary Box Set]]'' which, as well as the remixes of classic songs and unreleased live material, included a whole CD of old songs from the band's entire career recorded by the current line-up, and the 1993 ''[[Nightcap (album)|Nightcap]]'' compilation album containing unreleased studio material (mainly from the scrapped pre-''A Passion Play'' album), with multiple flute parts re-recorded.\n\nPrior to the recording of 1995's ''[[Roots to Branches]]'' album, longstanding bass player Dave Pegg left the band, wishing to concentrate on Fairport Convention and not being keen on the world-music direction the band chose. Doane Perry (returning as the band's full-time drummer) recruited his friend and widely respected session bass player [[Steve Bailey]] to fill the gap: Ian Anderson, in turn, relinquished control of the rhythm section arrangements on that record, leaving them completely to Bailey and Perry. Despite his studio contributions, however, Bailey did not join the band, and Pegg's formal replacement as Jethro Tull bassist was [[Jonathan Noyce]].\n\n''Roots to Branches'' (1995) and 1999's ''[[J-Tull Dot Com]]'' were less rock-based than ''Crest of a Knave'' (1987) or ''Catfish Rising'' (1991). Songs on these albums reflect the musical influences of decades of performing all around the globe. In songs such as \"Out of the Noise\" and \"Hot Mango Flush\", Anderson paints vivid pictures of third-world street scenes. These albums reflected Anderson's coming to grips with being an old rocker, with songs such as the pensive \"Another Harry's Bar\", \"Wicked Windows\" (a meditation on reading glasses), and the gruff \"Wounded, Old and Treacherous\".\n\n===Live albums, world tours and ''The Jethro Tull Christmas Album'' (2001\u20132010)===\nIn January 2002, the original lineup of the band (including Anderson, Abrahams, Cornick and Bunker) reunited for a one-off pub performance in England that was filmed for inclusion in the ''Living with the Past'' DVD.  It was the first and only time the original four members had played together since 1968, as well as the only time a former Tull lineup has ever reunited.\n\n2003 saw the release of ''[[The Jethro Tull Christmas Album]]'', a collection of traditional Christmas songs together with old and new Christmas songs written by Jethro Tull. It is the last studio album of this band. It became the band's biggest commercial success since the 1987 ''Crest of a Knave''. An Ian Anderson live double album and DVD was released in 2005 called ''[[Ian Anderson Plays the Orchestral Jethro Tull]]''. In addition, a DVD entitled ''[[Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970]]'' and a live album ''[[Aqualung Live]]'' (recorded in 2004) were released in 2005.\n\n2006 saw the release of a dual boxed set DVD ''Collector's Edition'', containing two DVDs\u2014''[[Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970]]'' and ''[[Living with the Past]]''. Bassist Jon Noyce left the band in March 2006. Keyboardist [[Andrew Giddings]] quit the band in July 2006, citing constant touring allowing not enough time for family. They were replaced by [[David Goodier]] and [[John O'Hara (musician)|John O'Hara]] respectively. In the following year ''[[The Best of Acoustic Jethro Tull]]'', a 24-song set of Tull's and Ian Anderson's acoustic performances taken from various albums, was released. Included are a new live acoustic version of \"One Brown Mouse\" and a live performance of the traditional song (attributed to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]), \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\".\n\nIn September 2007, Jethro Tull released CD/DVD ''[[Live at Montreux 2003 (Jethro Tull album)|Live at Montreux 2003]]''. The concert was recorded on 4 July 2003 and featured, among others, \"Fat Man\", \"With You There to Help Me\" and \"Hunting Girl\", with the longest unchanged line-up: Anderson, Barre, Perry, Noyce and Giddings.\n\nIn February 2010, the band were commemorated with a [[Heritage Award]] by [[PRS for Music]]. A plaque was erected on a Catholic church in [[Blackpool]], where the band performed their first ever gig.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lancashire/8536951.stm |work=BBC News | title=Jethro Tull's church gig honoured | date=25 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Anderson and Barre go solo and the end of Jethro Tull (2011\u20132012)===\n2011 marked the 40th Anniversary of ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' (1971). A new re-issue was released with new remix of the album (by [[Porcupine Tree]]'s [[Steven Wilson]]) and include a DVD and unreleased songs.\n\nDuring interviews in November 2011, Martin Barre stated that there were no current plans for future Jethro Tull work. In 2012, Barre assembled and toured with a group, billed as Martin Barre's New Day, which included Jonathan Noyce that played mostly Tull material.<ref name=\"crr\">{{cite web | url=http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviewmartinbarre2011.htm | title=Forty years of Aqualung: An interview with Jethro Tull's Martin Barre | accessdate=25 November 2011 | author=Wright, Jeb | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123173724/http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviewmartinbarre2011.htm | archive-date=23 November 2011 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=22 November 2011|work=Classic Rock Revisited|title=Interview with Martin Barre}}</ref> In 2015, Barre stated \"It's important that people realize there will never be a Jethro Tull again.

This will be followed by tours in the UK and US, during which the album will be played in its entirety. ''Homo Erraticus'' will be a prog-rock concept album which, according to Anderson, \"chronicles the weird imaginings of one Ernest T. Parritt, as recaptured by the now middle-aged Gerald Bostock after a trip to Mathew Bunter's Old Library Bookshop in Linwell village. Bostock and Bunter came across this dusty, unpublished manuscript, written by local amateur historian Ernest T. Parritt, (1873\u20131928), and entitled Homo Britanicus Erraticus.\" Like ''Thick as a Brick 2'', ''Homo Erraticus'' is billed as an Ian Anderson solo album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/homo-erraticus-the-new-studio-album-from-ian-anderson/ | title=Homo Eratticus&nbsp;\u2013 The New Studio Album From Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson |accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn an April 2014 interview following the release of Anderson's solo album ''Homo Erraticus'', Anderson announced that from that point on, he would be releasing all his music under his own name. Anderson stated that Tull \"kind of came more or less to an end during the last 10 years or so\", and stated his preference \"in my twilight years, to use my own name for the most part being composer of virtually all Tull songs and music since 1968\".<ref name=\"billboard end\"/><ref name=\"billboard end\"/> In the liner notes Anderson explains that he will continue to operate under his own name.\n\n2015 saw Anderson tour with the ''Ian Anderson Touring Band'' and the project ''Jethro Tull&nbsp;\u2013 The Rock Opera''; a lyrically modified Tull repertoire and new rock songs about the namesake of the band, Jethro Tull, together with elaborate video productions to the stage.

They therefore embarked on the design of a new machine which would include a [[floating point unit]]; work began in 1951. The resulting machine, which ran its first program in May 1954, was known as Meg, or the megacycle machine. It was smaller and simpler than the Mark 1, as well as quicker at solving maths problems. [[Ferranti]] produced a commercial version marketed as the [[Ferranti Mercury]], in which the Williams tubes were replaced by the more reliable [[core memory]].{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|p=31|ps=none}}\n\n==Transistor Computer==\nWork on building a smaller and cheaper computer began in 1952, in parallel with Meg's ongoing development. Two of Kilburn's team, [[Richard Grimsdale]] and D. C. Webb, were assigned to the task of designing and building a machine using the newly developed [[transistor]]s instead of valves. Initially the only devices available were [[germanium]] [[point-contact transistor]]s, less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power.{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|pp=34\u201335|ps=none}}\n\nTwo versions of the machine were produced.

The first Atlas was officially commissioned on 7 December 1962, and was considered at that time to be the most powerful computer in the world, equivalent to four [[IBM 7094]]s.{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|p=41|ps=none}} It was said that whenever Atlas went offline half of the UK's computer capacity was lost.{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|pp=44\u201345|ps=none}} Its fastest instructions took 1.59 microseconds to execute, and the machine's use of [[virtual memory|virtual storage]] and paging allowed each concurrent user to have up to one million words of storage space available.

The instruction set was designed to permit the generation of efficient object code by compilers, to allow for a pipeline organisation of the processor and to provide information to the hardware on the nature of operands, so as to allow them to be optimally buffered. Thus named variables were buffered separately from array elements, which were themselves accessed by means of named descriptors. Each descriptor included an array length which could be used in string processing instructions or to enable array bound checking to be carried out by hardware. The instruction pre-fetching mechanism used an associative jump trace to predict the outcome of impending branches<ref>{{citation | last=Sumner | first=F.H. | contribution=MU5 - An Assessment of the Design |title= Information Processing 74 | pages=133\u2013136 | publisher=North Holland | date=1974 }}</ref>.\n\nThe MU5 operating system MUSS<ref>{{Citation | last1=Frank | first1=G.R. | last2=Theaker | first2=C.J. | title=The design of the MUSS operating system | journal=Software Practice and Experience | volume=9 | issue=8 | pages=599\u2013620 | year=1979 | doi=10.1002/spe.4380090802}}</ref>{{sfnp | Morris & Ibbett |1979 | pp=189-211 | ps=none}} was designed to be highly adaptable and was ported to a variety of processors at Manchester and elsewhere.

They therefore embarked on the design of a new machine which would include a [[floating point unit]]; work began in 1951. The resulting machine, which ran its first program in May 1954, was known as Meg, or the megacycle machine. It was smaller and simpler than the Mark 1, as well as quicker at solving maths problems.

Two of Kilburn's team, [[Richard Grimsdale]] and D. C. Webb, were assigned to the task of designing and building a machine using the newly developed [[transistor]]s instead of valves. Initially the only devices available were [[germanium]] [[point-contact transistor]]s, less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power.{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|pp=34\u201335|ps=none}}\n\nTwo versions of the machine were produced.

The instruction set was designed to permit the generation of efficient object code by compilers, to allow for a pipeline organisation of the processor and to provide information to the hardware on the nature of operands, so as to allow them to be optimally buffered. Thus named variables were buffered separately from array elements, which were themselves accessed by means of named descriptors. Each descriptor included an array length which could be used in string processing instructions or to enable array bound checking to be carried out by hardware.
