The territory of the Yuan was administered in 12 districts during the reign of [[Kublai Khan]] with a governor and vice-governor each.

This led to some improvement in relations between these different peoples. The end of the Qing dynasty also marked an increase in Sino-foreign interaction. This led to increased contact between Muslim minorities in China and the Islamic states of the Middle East. A missionary, Claude Pickens, found 834 well-known Hui who had made [[hajj]] between 1923 and 1934. By 1939, at least 33 Hui Muslims had studied at Cairo's [[Al-Azhar University]]. In 1912, the Chinese Muslim Federation was formed in the capital [[Nanjing]]. Similar organization formed in [[Beijing]] (1912), [[Shanghai]] (1925) and [[Jinan]] (1934).<ref>Gladney (1999), pg. 457</ref> Academic activities within the Muslim community also flourished. Before the Sino-Japanese War of 1937, there existed more than a hundred known Muslim periodicals. Thirty journals were published between 1911 and 1937. Although [[Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture|Linxia]] remained the center for religious activities, many Muslim cultural activities had shifted to Beijing.<ref>Gladney (1999), pg. 458</ref>\n\nIn the first decade of the 20th century, it has been estimated that there were 20 million Muslims in [[China proper]] (that is, China excluding the regions of Mongolia and Xinjiang).<ref>Counting up the number of people of traditionally Muslim nationalities who were enumerated in the 1990 census gives a total of 17.6 million, 96% of whom belong to just three nationalities: Hui 8.6 million, Uyghurs 7.2 million, and Kazakhs 1.1 million.

According to Wan Lei, \"Statistics showed that the Japanese destroyed 220 mosques and killed countless Hui people by April 1941.\" After the [[Rape of Nanking]] mosques in Nanjing were found to be filled with dead bodies.They also followed a policy of economic oppression which involved the destruction of mosques and Hui communities and made many Hui jobless and homeless. Another policy was one of deliberate humiliation.  This included soldiers smearing mosques with pork fat, forcing Hui to butcher pigs to feed the soldiers, and forcing girls to ostensibly train as geishas and singers but in fact made them serve as sex slaves.

Mrs. Ha asked them why they killed her husband and they shot her. Mrs. Hsia was dragged out from under a table in the guest hall where she had tried to hide with her 1-year-old baby. After being stripped and raped by one or more men, she was bayoneted in the chest, and then had a bottle thrust into her vagina. The baby was killed with a bayonet. Some soldiers then went to the next room, where Mrs. Hsia's parents, aged 76 and 74, and her two daughters aged 16 and 14. They were about to rape the girls when the grandmother tried to protect them. The soldiers killed her with a revolver. The grandfather grasped the body of his wife and was killed. The two girls were then stripped, the elder being raped by 2\u20133 men, and the younger by 3. The older girl was stabbed afterwards and a cane was rammed in her vagina. The younger girl was bayoneted also but was spared the horrible treatment that had been meted out to her sister and mother. The soldiers then bayoneted another sister of between 7\u20138, who was also in the room. The last murders in the house were of Ha's two children, aged 4 and 2 respectively.

Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. Incidents such as these which make Tibetans look bad on the international stage are covered up by the [[Tibetan exile]] community.

This led to some improvement in relations between these different peoples. The end of the Qing dynasty also marked an increase in Sino-foreign interaction. This led to increased contact between Muslim minorities in China and the Islamic states of the Middle East. A missionary, Claude Pickens, found 834 well-known Hui who had made [[hajj]] between 1923 and 1934. By 1939, at least 33 Hui Muslims had studied at Cairo's [[Al-Azhar University]].

Before the Sino-Japanese War of 1937, there existed more than a hundred known Muslim periodicals. Thirty journals were published between 1911 and 1937.

Another policy was one of deliberate humiliation.  This included soldiers smearing mosques with pork fat, forcing Hui to butcher pigs to feed the soldiers, and forcing girls to ostensibly train as geishas and singers but in fact made them serve as sex slaves.

The two girls were then stripped, the elder being raped by 2\u20133 men, and the younger by 3. The older girl was stabbed afterwards and a cane was rammed in her vagina. The younger girl was bayoneted also but was spared the horrible treatment that had been meted out to her sister and mother. The soldiers then bayoneted another sister of between 7\u20138, who was also in the room. The last murders in the house were of Ha's two children, aged 4 and 2 respectively.

Hatred between Tibeans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang's rule in Qinghai such as [[Ngolok rebellions (1917\u201349)]] and the [[Sino-Tibetan War]], but in 1949 the Communists put an end to the violence between Tibetans and Muslims, however, new Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide.

This caused Sonam Rabten who became the 5th Dalai Lama's ''changdzo'' or manager,<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 198.</ref> to seek more active Mongol patronage and military assistance for the Gelugpa while the Fifth was still a boy.<ref name=TN2 /> So, in 1620, Mongol troops allied to the Gelugpa who had camped outside Lhasa suddenly attacked and destroyed the two Tsangpa camps and drove them out of Lhasa, enabling the Dalai Lama to be brought out of hiding and publicly enthroned there in 1622.<ref name=shak101 />\n\nIn fact, throughout the 5th's minority, it was the influential and forceful Sonam Rabten who inspired the [[Dzungars|Dzungar Mongols]] to defend the Gelugpa by attacking their enemies. These enemies included other Mongol tribes who supported the Tsangpas, the Tsangpa themselves and their B\u00f6npo allies in Kham who had also opposed and persecuted Gelugpas. Ultimately, this strategy led to the destruction of the Tsangpa dynasty, the defeat of the Karmapas and their other allies and the B\u00f6npos, by armed forces from the Lhasa valley aided by their Mongol allies, paving the way for Gelugpa political and religious hegemony in Central Tibet.<ref name=SK /> Apparently by general consensus, by virtue of his position as the Dalai Lama's ''changdzo'' (chief attendant, minister), after the Dalai Lama became absolute ruler of Tibet in 1642 Sonam Rabten became the \"''Desi''\" or \"Viceroy\", in fact, the ''de facto'' regent or day-to-day ruler of Tibet's governmental affairs.

'The Great Fifth' became the temporal ruler of Tibet in 1642 and from then on the rule of the Dalai Lama lineage over some, all or most of Tibet lasted with few breaks for the next 317 years, until 1959, when the [[14th Dalai Lama]] fled to India.<ref>{{harv|Buswell|Lopez|2014|p=210}}</ref> In 1645, the Great Fifth began the construction of the [[Potala Palace]] in Lhasa.<ref name=mull201>Mullin 2001, p. 201.</ref>\n\nG\u00fcshi Khan died in 1655 and was succeeded by his descendants [[Dayan Khan (Khoshut)|Dayan]], [[Tenzin Dalai Khan]] and Tenzin Wangchuk Khan.

In 1648, after quelling a rebellion of Tibetans of Kansu-Xining, the Qing invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to visit their court at Beijing since they wished to engender Tibetan influence in their dealings with the Mongols. The Qing were aware the Dalai Lama had extraordinary influence with the Mongols and saw relations with the Dalai Lama as a means to facilitate submission of the [[Khalka Mongols]], traditional patrons of the [[Karma Kagyu]] sect. Similarly, since the Tibetan Gelugpa were keen to revive a [[priest-patron]] relationship with the dominant power in China and Inner Asia, the Qing invitation was accepted. After five years of complex diplomatic negotiations about whether the emperor or his representatives should meet the Dalai Lama inside or outside the Great Wall, when the meeting would be astrologically favourable, how it would be conducted and so on, it eventually took place in Beijing in 1653. The Shunzhi Emperor was then 16 years old, having in the meantime ascended the throne in 1650 after the death of Dorgon. For the Qing, although the Dalai Lama was not required to [[kowtow]] to the emperor, who rose from his throne and advanced 30 feet to meet him, the significance of the visit was that of nominal political submission by the Dalai Lama since Inner Asian heads of state did not travel to meet each other but sent envoys. For Tibetan Buddhist historians however it was interpreted as the start of an era of independent rule of the Dalai Lamas, and of Qing patronage alongside that of the Mongols.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 108\u2013113.</ref>\n\nWhen the 5th Dalai Lama returned, he was granted by the emperor of China a golden seal of authority and golden sheets with texts written in Manchu, Tibetan and Chinese languages.<ref name=\"\u9648\u5e86\u82f12005_p41\">{{cite book |author=\u9648\u5e86\u82f1 |title=\u8fbe\u8d56\u5587\u561b\u8f6c\u4e16\u53ca\u5386\u53f2\u5b9a\u5236\u82f1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=haMIsdC3iZwC&pg=PA41 |year=2005 |publisher=\u4e94\u6d32\u4f20\u64ad\u51fa\u7248\u793e |isbn = 978-7-5085-0745-3 |pages=41\u2013}}</ref><ref name=K309>Karmay 2014, p. 309.</ref> The 5th Dalai Lama wanted to use the golden seal of authority right away.<ref name=\"\u9648\u5e86\u82f12005_p41\" /> However, Lobzang Gyatsho noted that \"The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongolian translator but was not a good translation\".

For example, concerning the above-mentioned 'golden seal', the Fifth Dalai Lama comments in ''Dukula'', his autobiography, on leaving China after this courtesy visit to the emperor in 1653, that \"the emperor made his men bring a golden seal for me that had three vertical lines in three parallel scripts: Chinese, Mongolian and Tibetan\". He also criticised the words carved on this gift as being faultily translated into Tibetan, writing that \"The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongol translator but was not a good translation\".<ref name=K309/> Furthermore, when he arrived back in Tibet, he discarded the emperor's famous golden seal and made a new one for important state usage, writing in his autobiography: \"Leaving out the Chinese characters that were on the seal given by the emperor, a new seal was carved for stamping documents that dealt with territorial issues. The first imprint of the seal was offered with prayers to the image of Lokeshvara ...\".<ref>Karmay 2014, p. 402.</ref>\n\n==== Relations with the Qing dynasty ====\nThe 17th-century struggles for domination between the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the various Mongol groups spilled over to involve Tibet because of the Fifth Dalai Lama's strong influence over the Mongols as a result of their general adoption of Tibetan Buddhism and their consequent deep loyalty to the Dalai Lama as their guru. Until 1674, the Fifth Dalai Lama had mediated in [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongol]] affairs whenever they required him to do so, and the [[Kangxi Emperor]], who had succeeded the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661, would accept and confirm his decisions automatically. For the Kangxi Emperor however, the alliance between the Dzungar Mongols and the Tibetans was unsettling because he feared it had the potential to unite all the other Mongol tribes together against the Qing Empire, including those tribes who had already submitted. Therefore, in 1674, the Kangxi Emperor, annoyed by the Fifth's less than full cooperation in quelling a rebellion against the Qing in [[Yunnan]], ceased deferring to him as regards Mongol affairs and started dealing with them directly.<ref name=TN6>Smith 1997, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nIn the same year, 1674, the Dalai Lama, then at the height of his powers and conducting a foreign policy independent of the Qing, caused Mongol troops to occupy the border post of [[Dartsedo]] between Kham and Sichuan, further annoying the Kangxi Emperor who (according to Smith) already considered Tibet as part of the Qing Empire. It also increased Qing suspicion about Tibetan relations with the Mongol groups and led him to seek strategic opportunities to oppose and undermine Mongol influence in Tibet and eventually, within 50 years, to defeat the Mongols militarily and to establish the Qing as sole 'patrons and protectors' of Tibet in their place.<ref name=TN6 />\n\n==== Cultural development ====\nThe time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, who reigned from 1642 to 1682 and founded the government known as the [[Ganden Phodrang]], was a period of rich cultural development.<ref>Snellgrove & Richardson 1968, p. 197.</ref> His reign and that of [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred. The same goes for the great increase in the number of foreign visitors thronging Lhasa during the period as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the 'Great Fifth', as the Tibetans refer to him.<ref>Stein 1972, p. 84\u20135.</ref> The most dynamic and prolific of the early Dalai Lamas, he composed more literary works than all the other Dalai Lamas combined. Writing on a wide variety of subjects he is specially noted for his works on history, classical Indian poetry in Sanskrit and his biographies of notable personalities of his epoch, as well as his own two autobiographies, one spiritual in nature and the other political (see [[Dalai Lama#Further reading|Further Reading]]).<ref name=mull83244>Mullin 1983, p. 244.</ref> He also taught and travelled extensively, reshaped the politics of Central Asia, unified Tibet, conceived and constructed the Potala Palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education.<ref name=mull83244 />\n\n==== Death of the fifth Dalai Lama ====\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama died in 1682. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that the written wills from the fifth Dalai Lama before he died explicitly said his title and authority were from the Emperor of China, and he was subordinate of the Emperor of China\n.<ref name=\"\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997\" />\n\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama's death in 1682 was kept secret for fifteen years by his regent [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]]. He pretended the Dalai Lama was in retreat and ruled on his behalf, secretly selecting the 6th Dalai Lama and presenting him as someone else. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that Desi Sangye Gyatso wanted to consolidate his personal status and power by not reporting the death of the fifth Dalai Lama to the Emperor of China, and also collude with the rebellion group of the Qing dynasty, Mongol [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] tribe in order to counter influence from another Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe in Tibet. Being afraid of prosecution by the Kangxi Emperor of China, Desi Sangye Gyatso explained with fear and trepidation the reason behind his action to the Emperor. In 1705, Desi Sangye Gyatso was killed by [[Lha-bzang Khan]] of the Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe because of his actions including his illegal action of selecting the 6th Dalai Lama. Since the Kangxi Emperor was not happy about Desi Sangye Gyatso's action of not reporting, the Emperor gave [[Lha-bzang Khan]] additional title and golden seal. The Kangxi Emperor also ordered [[Lha-bzang Khan]] to arrest the 6th Dalai Lama and send him to Beijing, the 6th Dalai Lama died when he was en route to Beijing.<ref name=\"\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997\" /> Journalist Thomas Laird argues that it was apparently done so that construction of the Potala Palace could be finished, and it was to prevent Tibet's neighbors, the Mongols and the Qing, from taking advantage of an interregnum in the succession of the Dalai Lamas.{{harv|Laird|2006|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n=== 6th Dalai Lama ===\nThe [[6th Dalai Lama|Sixth Dalai Lama]] (1683\u20131706) was born near [[Tawang]], now in India, and picked out in 1685 but not enthroned until 1697 when the death of the Fifth was announced. After 16 years of study as a novice monk, in 1702 in his 20th year he rejected full ordination and gave up his monk's robes and monastic life, preferring the lifestyle of a layman.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 245\u2013256.</ref><ref>Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, ''Kleine Geschichte Tibets'', M\u00fcnchen 2006, pp. 109\u2013122.</ref>\n\nIn 1703 G\u00fcshi Khan's ruling grandson Tenzin Wangchuk Khan was murdered by his brother [[Lha-bzang Khan|Lhazang Khan]] who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne, but unlike his four predecessors he started interfering directly in Tibetan affairs in Lhasa; he opposed the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] for his deceptions and in the same year, with the support of the Kangxi Emperor, he forced him out of office. Then in 1705, he used the Sixth's escapades as an excuse to seize full control of Tibet. Most Tibetans, though, still supported their Dalai Lama despite his behaviour and deeply resented Lhazang Khan's interference. When Lhazang was requested by the Tibetans to leave Lhasa politics to them and to retire to Kokonor like his predecessors, he quit the city, but only to gather his armies in order to return, capture Lhasa militarily and assume full political control of Tibet.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 121.</ref> The regent was then murdered by Lhazang or his wife, and, in 1706 with the compliance of the Kangxi Emperor the Sixth Dalai Lama was deposed and arrested by Lhazang who considered him to be an impostor set up by the regent. [[Lhazang Khan]], now acting as the only outright foreign ruler that Tibet had ever had, then sent him to Beijing under escort to appear before the emperor but he died mysteriously on the way near [[Lake Qinghai]], ostensibly from illness.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 260\u2013271.</ref><ref name=\"HarperCollins\">Smith 1997, p. 122.</ref>\n\nHaving discredited and deposed the Sixth Dalai Lama, whom he considered an impostor, and having removed the regent, Lhazang Khan pressed the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas to endorse a new Dalai Lama in [[Tsangyang Gyatso]]'s place as the true incarnation of the Fifth. They eventually nominated one Pekar Dzinpa, a monk but also rumored to be Lhazang's son,<ref>McKay 2003, p. 569.</ref> and Lhazang had him installed as the 'real' Sixth Dalai Lama, endorsed by the [[Panchen Lama]] and named [[Yeshe Gyatso]] in 1707.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 274.</ref> This choice was in no way accepted by the Tibetan people, however, nor by Lhazang's princely Mongol rivals in Kokonor who resented his usurpation of the [[Khoshut]] Tibetan throne as well as his meddling in Tibetan affairs. The Kangxi Emperor concurred with them, after sending investigators, initially declining to recognize [[Yeshe Gyatso]]. He did recognize him in 1710, however, after sending a Qing official party to assist Lhazang in 'restoring order'; these were the first Chinese representatives of any sort to officiate in Tibet.<ref name=\"HarperCollins\" /> At the same time, while this puppet 'Dalai Lama' had no political power, the Kangxi Emperor secured from Lhazang Khan in return for this support the promise of regular payments of tribute; this was the first time tribute had been paid to the Manchu by the Mongols in Tibet and the first overt acknowledgment of Qing supremacy over Mongol rule in Tibet.<ref>Richardson 1984, p. 48.</ref>\n\n=== 7th Dalai Lama ===\nIn 1708, in accordance with an indication given by the [[6th Dalai Lama]] when quitting Lhasa a child called Kelzang Gyatso had been born at [[Lithang]] in eastern Tibet who was soon claimed by local Tibetans to be his incarnation. After going into hiding out of fear of Lhazang Khan, he was installed in Lithang monastery. Along with some of the Kokonor Mongol princes, rivals of Lhazang, in defiance of the situation in Lhasa the Tibetans of [[Kham]] duly recognised him as the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] in 1712, retaining his birth-name of [[Kelzang Gyatso]].

Their force sent to fetch Kelzang Gyatso however was intercepted and destroyed by Qing armies alerted by Lhazang. In Lhasa, the unruly Dzungar not only failed to produce the boy but also went on the rampage, looting and destroying the holy places, abusing the populace, killing hundreds of Nyingma monks, causing chaos and bloodshed and turning their Tibetan allies against them.

On the imperial army's stately passage from [[Kumbum]] to Lhasa with the boy being welcomed adoringly at every stage, [[Khoshut]] Mongols and Tibetans were happy (and well paid) to join and swell its ranks.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 287\u20139.</ref> By the autumn of 1720 the marauding [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongols]] had been vanquished from Tibet and the Qing imperial forces had entered Lhasa triumphantly with the 12-year-old, acting as patrons of the Dalai Lama, liberators of Tibet, allies of the Tibetan anti-Dzungar forces led by [[Khangchenn\u00e9|Kangchenas]] and [[Polhan\u00e9 S\u00f6nam Topgy\u00e9|Polhanas]], and allies of the [[Khoshut]] Mongol princes.

This led eventually to the murder of [[Khangchenn\u00e9|Kanchenas]] in 1727 and a civil war that was resolved in 1728 with the canny [[Pholhane|Polhanas]], who had sent for Qing assistance, the victor. When the Qing forces did arrive they punished the losers and exiled the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] to Kham, under the pretence of sending him to Beijing, because his father had assisted the defeated, anti-Qing faction. He studied and taught Buddhism there for the next seven years.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 129\u201330.</ref>\n\n==== Return to Lhasa ====\nIn 1735 he was allowed back to Lhasa to study and teach, but still under strict control, being mistrusted by the Qing, while [[Polhan\u00e9 S\u00f6nam Topgy\u00e9|Polhanas]] ruled [[Central Tibet]] under nominal Qing supervision. Meanwhile, the Qing had promoted the [[Fifth Panchen Lama]] to be a rival leader and reinstated the ''ambans'' and the Lhasa garrison. Polhanas died in 1747 and was succeeded by his son [[Gyurme Namgyal]], the last dynastic ruler of Tibet, who was far less cooperative with the Qing. On the contrary, he built a Tibetan army and started conspiring with the Dzungars to rid Tibet of Qing influence.<ref>Shakabpa 1967, pp. 147\u20138.</ref> In 1750, when the ''ambans'' realised this, they invited him and personally assassinated him and then, despite the Dalai Lama's attempts to calm the angered populace a vengeful Tibetan mob assassinated the ''ambans'' in turn, along with most of their escort.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 130\u2013132.</ref>\n\n==== Restoration as Tibet's political leader ====\nThe Qing sent yet another force 'to restore order' but when it arrived the situation had already been stabilised under the leadership of the [[7th Dalai Lama]] who was now seen to have demonstrated loyalty to the Qing. Just as G\u00fcshi Khan had done with the Fifth Dalai Lama, they therefore helped reconstitute the government with the Dalai Lama presiding over a [[Kashag]] of four Tibetans, reinvesting him with temporal power in addition to his already established spiritual leadership. This arrangement, with a Kashag under the Dalai Lama or his regent, outlasted the Qing dynasty which collapsed in 1912.<ref>Van Schaik 2011, p. 144; Shakabpa 1967, p. 150.</ref> The ''ambans'' and their garrison were also reinstated to observe and to some extent supervise affairs, however, although their influence generally waned with the power of their empire which gradually declined after 1792 along with its influence over Tibet, a decline aided by a succession of corrupt or incompetent ''ambans''.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 137.</ref> Moreover, there was soon no reason for the Qing to fear the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]]; by the time the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] died in 1757 at the age of 49, the entire [[Dzungar people]] had been practically exterminated through years of genocidal campaigns by Qing armies, and deadly smallpox epidemics, with the survivors being forcibly transported into China. Their emptied lands were then awarded to other peoples.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 132\u20133.</ref>\n\nAccording to Mullin, despite living through such violent times Kelzang Gyatso was perhaps 'the most spiritually learned and accomplished of any Dalai Lama', his written works comprising several hundred titles including 'some of Tibet's finest spiritual literary achievements'.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 302, p. 308.</ref> In addition, despite his apparent lack of zeal in politics, Kelzang Gyatso is credited with establishing in 1751 the reformed government of Tibet headed by the Dalai Lama, which continued over 200 years until the 1950s, and then in exile.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 303.</ref> Construction of the [[Norbulingka]], the 'Summer Palace' of the Dalai Lamas in Lhasa was also started during Kelzang Gyatso's reign.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Suhasini Haidar|title=At Lhasa, Tibetans still pray for Dalai Lama's return|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/at-lhasa-tibetans-still-pray-for-dalai-lamas-return/article6367393.ece|accessdate=19 July 2015|newspaper=The Hindu|date=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to The Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka, Tibet|url=http://worldheritage.routes.travel/world-heritage-site/the-potala-palace-jokhang-temple-and-norbulingka-tibet/|publisher=World Heritage|accessdate=19 July 2015|quote=Norbulingka was built in the 1700s by the seventh Dalai Lama and served as the regular dwelling of future Dalai Lamas.

According to Mullin, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] has pointed to certain indications that [[Jamphel Gyatso]] might not have been the incarnation of the [[7th Dalai Lama]] but of Jamyang Chojey, a disciple of [[Tsongkhapa]] and founder of Drepung monastery who was also reputed to be an incarnation of [[Avalokiteshvara]]. In any case, he mainly lived a quiet and unassuming life as a devoted and studious monk, uninvolved in the kind of dramas that had surrounded his predecessors.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 323\u20137.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, [[Jamphel Gyatso]] was also said to possess all the signs of being the true incarnation of the [[Seventh Dalai Lama|Seventh]]. This was also claimed to have been confirmed by many portents clear to the Tibetans and so, in 1762, at the age of 5, he was duly enthroned as the [[Eighth Dalai Lama]] at the [[Potala Palace]].<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 328\u2013332.</ref> At the age of 23 he was persuaded to assume the throne as ruler of Tibet with a [[Regent]] to assist him and after three years of this, when the Regent went to Beijing as ambassador in 1784, he continued to rule solo for a further four years. Feeling unsuited to worldly affairs, however, and unhappy in this role, he then retired from public office to concentrate on religious activities for his remaining 16 years until his death in 1804.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 333\u20134.</ref> He is also credited with the construction of the [[Norbulingka]] 'Summer Palace' started by his predecessor in Lhasa and with ordaining some ten thousand monks in his efforts to foster monasticism.<ref>Mullin 2001 pp. 338\u20139.</ref>\n\n=== 9th to 12th Dalai Lamas ===\nHugh Richardson's summary of the period covering the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas:\n{{quote|After him [the [[8th Dalai Lama]], Jamphel Gyatso], the [[9th Dalai Lama|9th]] and [[10th Dalai Lama]]s died before attaining their majority: one of them is credibly stated to have been murdered and strong suspicion attaches to the other. The [[11th Dalai Lama|11th]] and [[12th Dalai Lama|12th]] were each enthroned but died soon after being invested with power. For 113 years, therefore, supreme authority in Tibet was in the hands of a Lama Regent, except for about two years when a lay noble held office and for short periods of nominal rule by the 11th and 12th Dalai Lamas.{{efn|According to Mullin, Smith and Shakabpa however, the 12th Dalai Lama's Regent, Reting Rinpoche, was deposed in 1862 in a coup by Gyalpo Shetra and Tibet was ruled by despots or assemblies of abbots and ministers for the next eleven years, that is until 1873 when the 12th Dalai Lama assumed power.}}<br />It has sometimes been suggested that this state of affairs was brought about by the Ambans\u2014the Imperial Residents in Tibet\u2014because it would be easier to control the Tibet through a Regent than when a Dalai Lama, with his absolute power, was at the head of the government. That is not true. The regular ebb and flow of events followed its set course. The Imperial Residents in Tibet, after the first flush of zeal in 1750, grew less and less interested and efficient. Tibet was, to them, exile from the urbanity and culture of Peking; and so far from dominating the Regents, the Ambans allowed themselves to be dominated. It was the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans that led to five successive Dalai Lamas being subjected to continuous tutelage. {{harv|Richardson|1984|pp=59\u201360}}}}\n\n[[Thubten Jigme Norbu]], the elder brother of the 14th Dalai Lama, described these unfortunate events as follows, although there are few, if any, indications that any of the four were said to be 'Chinese-appointed imposters':\n{{quote|It is perhaps more than a coincidence that between the seventh and the thirteenth holders of that office, only one reached his majority. The eighth, Gyampal Gyatso, died when he was in his thirties, Lungtog Gyatso when he was eleven, Tsultrim Gyatso at eighteen, Khadrup Gyatso when he was eighteen also, and Krinla Gyatso at about the same age. The circumstances are such that it is very likely that some, if not all, were poisoned, either by loyal Tibetans for being Chinese-appointed impostors, or by the Chinese for not being properly manageable. Many Tibetans think that this was done at the time when the young [Dalai Lama] made his ritual visit to the Lake Lhamtso. ... Each of the four [Dalai Lamas] to die young expired shortly after his visit to the lake. Many said it was because they were not the true reincarnations, but imposters imposed by the Chinese. Others tell stories of how the cooks of the retinue, which in those days included many Chinese, were bribed to put poison in the [Dalai Lama's] food. The 13th [Dalai Lama] did not visit Lhamtso until he was 25 years old. He was adequately prepared by spiritual exercise and he also had faithful cooks. The Chinese were disappointed when he did not die like his predecessors, and he was to live long enough to give them much more cause for regret.{{harv|Norbu|Turnbull|1968|pp.=311\u2013312}}{{efn|According to their biographies, the [[8th Dalai Lama|Eighth, Jamphel Gyatso]] lived to 46 years old, the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth, Lungtok Gyatso]] to 9 years, the [[10th Dalai Lama|Tenth, Tsultrim Gyatso]] to 21, the [[Khedrup Gyatso|Eleventh, Khedrup Gyatso]] to 17 and the [[Trinley Gyatso|Twelfth, Trinley Gyatso]] to 18.}}}}\n\nAccording to Mullin, on the other hand, it is improbable that the [[Manchus]] would have murdered any of these four for being 'unmanageable' since it would have been in their best interests to have strong Dalai Lamas ruling in Lhasa, he argues, agreeing with [[Hugh Edward Richardson|Richardson]] that it was rather \"the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans\" that might have caused the Lamas' early deaths.{{efn|Considering what occurred in Lhasa after the Chinese ''ambans'' murdered [[Gyurme Namgyal]] in 1750, however, the Manchus would have been particularly reluctant to murder a Dalai Lama.}} Further, if Tibetan nobles murdered any of them, it would more likely have been in order to protect or enhance their family interests rather than out of suspicion that the Dalai Lamas were seen as Chinese-appointed imposters as suggested by Norbu. They could also have died from illnesses, possibly contracted from diseases to which they had no immunity, carried to Lhasa by the multitudes of pilgrims visiting from nearby countries for blessings. Finally, from the Buddhist point of view, Mullin says, \"Simply stated, these four Dalai Lamas died young because the world did not have enough good karma to deserve their presence\".<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 343\u20136.</ref>\n\nTibetan historian K. Dhondup, however, in his history ''The Water-Bird and Other Years'', based on the Tibetan minister Surkhang Sawang Chenmo's historical manuscripts,<ref>Dhondup 1986, p. iv.</ref> disagrees with Mullin's opinion that having strong Dalai Lamas in power in Tibet would have been in China's best interests. He notes that many historians are compelled to suspect Manchu foul play in these serial early deaths because the Ambans had such latitude to interfere; the Manchu, he says, \"''to perpetuate their domination over Tibetan affairs, did not desire a Dalai Lama who will ascend the throne and become a strong and capable ruler over his own country and people''\". The life and deeds of the 13th Dalai Lama [in successfully upholding ''de facto'' Tibetan independence from China from 1912 to 1950] serve as the living proof of this argument, he points out.<ref>Dhondup 1986, p. 3.</ref> This account also corresponds with TJ Norbu's observations above.\n\nFinally, while acknowledging the possibility, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] himself doubts they were poisoned. He ascribes the probable cause of these early deaths to negligence, foolishness and lack of proper medical knowledge and attention. \"''Even today''\" he is quoted as saying, \"''when people get sick, some [Tibetans] will say: 'Just do your prayers, you don't need medical treatment.'''\"<ref>Laird 2006, p. 197.</ref>\n\n==== 9th Dalai Lama ====\nBorn in Kham in 1805/6 amidst the usual miraculous signs the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso]] was appointed by the [[7th Panchen Lama]]'s search team at the age of two and enthroned in the Potala in 1808 at an impressive ceremony attended by representatives from China, Mongolia, Nepal and Bhutan.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 346\u20138.</ref><ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 172.</ref> Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain and Wang Jiawei point out that the 9th Dalai Lama was allowed to use the seal of authority given to the late 8th Dalai Lama by the Emperor of China<ref name=\"Wang\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997_p71\">{{cite book|author1=Jiawei Wang|author2=\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e|title=The Historical Status of China's Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak3SQTVS7acC&pg=PA71|year=1997|publisher=\u4e94\u6d32\u4f20\u64ad\u51fa\u7248\u793e|isbn=978-7-80113-304-5|pages=71\u2013}}</ref>\n\nHis second Regent Demo Tulku was the biographer of the 8th and 9th Dalai Lamas and though the 9th died at the age of 9 his biography is as lengthy as those of many of the early Dalai Lamas.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 348.</ref> In 1793 under Manchu pressure Tibet had closed its borders to foreigners,<ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 173.</ref><ref>Richardson 1984, p. 71.</ref> but in 1811 a British Sinologist, [[Thomas Manning (sinologist)|Thomas Manning]] became the first Englishman to visit Lhasa.

After that he was immersed in religious studies under the Panchen Lama, amongst other great masters. Meanwhile, there were court intrigues and ongoing power struggles taking place between the various Lhasa factions, the Regent, the [[Kashag]], the powerful nobles and the abbots and monks of the three great monasteries. The Tsemonling Regent<ref>[http://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Trichen-73-Ngawang-Jampel-Tsultrim-Gyatso/6979|The Second Tsemonling, Ngawang Jampel Tsultrim Gyatso]</ref> became mistrusted and was forcibly deposed, there were machinations, plots, beatings and kidnappings of ministers and so forth, resulting at last in the Panchen Lama being appointed as interim Regent to keep the peace. Eventually the Third Reting Rinpoche was made Regent, and in 1855, Khedrup Gyatso, appearing to be an extremely promising prospect, was requested to take the reins of power at the age of 17.

The respected Reting Rinpoche was recalled once again to act as Regent and requested to lead the search for the next incarnation, the twelfth.<ref name=M361-7 /><ref name=S176-81 />\n\n==== 12th Dalai Lama ====\nIn 1856 a child was born in south [[central Tibet]] amidst all the usual extraordinary signs. He came to the notice of the search team, was investigated, passed the traditional tests and was recognised as the [[12th Dalai Lama]] in 1858. The use of the Chinese [[Golden Urn]] at the insistence of the Regent, who was later accused of being a Chinese lackey, confirmed this choice to the satisfaction of all. Renamed [[Trinley Gyatso]] and enthroned in 1860 the boy underwent 13 years of intensive tutelage and training before stepping up to rule Tibet at the age of 17.<ref name=M367>Mullin 2001, pp. 367\u2013373.</ref>\n\nHis minority seems a time of even deeper Lhasan political intrigue and power struggles than his predecessor's. By 1862 this led to a coup by Wangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against him. Shetra contrived to return, deposed the Regent, who fled to China, and seized power, appointing himself 'Desi' or Prime Minister.<ref name=M367 /> He then ruled with \"absolute power\" for three years,<ref name=S188>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 188\u20139.</ref> quelling a major rebellion in northern Kham in 1863 and re-establishing Tibetan control over significant [[Qing]]-held territory there.<ref name=Sm140>Smith 1997, p. 140.</ref> Shetra died in 1864 and the [[Kashag]] re-assumed power. The retired 76th [[Ganden Tripa]], Khyenrab Wangchuk, was appointed as 'Regent' but his role was limited to supervising and mentoring Trinley Gyatso.<ref name=M367 /><ref name=S188 />\n\nIn 1868 Shetra's coup organiser, a semi-literate [[Ganden]] monk named Palden Dondrup, seized power by another coup and ruled as a cruel despot for three years, putting opponents to death by having them 'sewn into fresh animal skins and thrown in the river'.<ref name=S188 /> In 1871, at the request of officials outraged after Dondrup had done just that with one minister and imprisoned several others, he in turn was ousted and committed suicide after a counter-coup coordinated by the supposedly powerless 'Regent' Khyenrab Wangchuk.<ref name=S188 /> As a result of this action this venerable old Regent, who died the next year, is fondly remembered by Tibetans as saviour of the Dalai Lama and the nation. The Kashag and the Tsongdu or National Assembly were re-instated, and, presided over by a Dalai Lama or his Regent, ruled without further interruption until 1959.<ref name=M367 />\n\nAccording to Smith, however, during Trinley Gyatso's minority, the Regent was deposed in 1862 for abuse of authority and closeness with China, by an alliance of monks and officials called ''Gandre Drungche'' (Ganden and Drepung Monks Assembly); this body then ruled Tibet for ten years until dissolved, when a National Assembly of monks and officials called the ''Tsongdu'' was created and took over. Smith makes no mention of Shetra or Dondrup acting as usurpers and despots in this period.<ref name=Sm140 />\n\nIn any case, Trinley Gyatso died within three years of assuming power. In 1873, at the age of 20 \"he suddenly became ill and passed away\".<ref name=M367 /> On the cause of his early death, accounts diverge. Mullin relates an interesting theory, based on cited Tibetan sources: out of concern for the monastic tradition, Trinley Gyatso chose to die and reincarnate as the [[13th Dalai Lama]], rather than taking the option of marrying a woman called Rigma Tsomo from Kokonor and leaving an heir to \"oversee Tibet's future\".<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 373\u2013375.</ref> Shakabpa on the other hand, without citing sources, notes that Trinley Gyatso was influenced and manipulated by two close acquaintances who were subsequently accused of having a hand in his fatal illness and imprisoned, tortured and exiled as a result.<ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 191.</ref>\n\n=== 13th Dalai Lama ===\n[[File:Throne awaiting Dalai Lama's return.

Due to his two periods of exile in 1904\u20131909 to escape the British invasion of 1904, and from 1910 to 1912 to escape a Chinese invasion, he became well aware of the complexities of international politics and was the first Dalai Lama to become aware of the importance of foreign relations. After his return from exile in India and [[Sikkim]] during January 1913, he assumed control of foreign relations and dealt directly with the [[Maharaja]], with the British Political officer in Sikkim and with the king of [[Nepal]] \u2013 rather than letting the Kashag or parliament do it. {{harv|Sheel|1989|pp=24, 29}}\n\nThe Thirteenth issued a Declaration of Independence for his kingdom in [[\u00dc-Tsang]] from China during the summer of 1912 and standardised a Tibetan flag, though no other sovereign state recognized Tibetan independence. {{harv|Sheel|1989|p=20}} He expelled the [[amban]]s and all Chinese civilians in the country and instituted many measures to modernise Tibet.

This caused Sonam Rabten who became the 5th Dalai Lama's ''changdzo'' or manager,<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 198.</ref> to seek more active Mongol patronage and military assistance for the Gelugpa while the Fifth was still a boy.<ref name=TN2 /> So, in 1620, Mongol troops allied to the Gelugpa who had camped outside Lhasa suddenly attacked and destroyed the two Tsangpa camps and drove them out of Lhasa, enabling the Dalai Lama to be brought out of hiding and publicly enthroned there in 1622.<ref name=shak101 />\n\nIn fact, throughout the 5th's minority, it was the influential and forceful Sonam Rabten who inspired the [[Dzungars|Dzungar Mongols]] to defend the Gelugpa by attacking their enemies. These enemies included other Mongol tribes who supported the Tsangpas, the Tsangpa themselves and their B\u00f6npo allies in Kham who had also opposed and persecuted Gelugpas. Ultimately, this strategy led to the destruction of the Tsangpa dynasty, the defeat of the Karmapas and their other allies and the B\u00f6npos, by armed forces from the Lhasa valley aided by their Mongol allies, paving the way for Gelugpa political and religious hegemony in Central Tibet.<ref name=SK /> Apparently by general consensus, by virtue of his position as the Dalai Lama's ''changdzo'' (chief attendant, minister), after the Dalai Lama became absolute ruler of Tibet in 1642 Sonam Rabten became the \"''Desi''\" or \"Viceroy\", in fact, the ''de facto'' regent or day-to-day ruler of Tibet's governmental affairs.

In 1648, after quelling a rebellion of Tibetans of Kansu-Xining, the Qing invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to visit their court at Beijing since they wished to engender Tibetan influence in their dealings with the Mongols. The Qing were aware the Dalai Lama had extraordinary influence with the Mongols and saw relations with the Dalai Lama as a means to facilitate submission of the [[Khalka Mongols]], traditional patrons of the [[Karma Kagyu]] sect. Similarly, since the Tibetan Gelugpa were keen to revive a [[priest-patron]] relationship with the dominant power in China and Inner Asia, the Qing invitation was accepted. After five years of complex diplomatic negotiations about whether the emperor or his representatives should meet the Dalai Lama inside or outside the Great Wall, when the meeting would be astrologically favourable, how it would be conducted and so on, it eventually took place in Beijing in 1653. The Shunzhi Emperor was then 16 years old, having in the meantime ascended the throne in 1650 after the death of Dorgon. For the Qing, although the Dalai Lama was not required to [[kowtow]] to the emperor, who rose from his throne and advanced 30 feet to meet him, the significance of the visit was that of nominal political submission by the Dalai Lama since Inner Asian heads of state did not travel to meet each other but sent envoys. For Tibetan Buddhist historians however it was interpreted as the start of an era of independent rule of the Dalai Lamas, and of Qing patronage alongside that of the Mongols.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 108\u2013113.</ref>\n\nWhen the 5th Dalai Lama returned, he was granted by the emperor of China a golden seal of authority and golden sheets with texts written in Manchu, Tibetan and Chinese languages.<ref name=\"\u9648\u5e86\u82f12005_p41\">{{cite book |author=\u9648\u5e86\u82f1 |title=\u8fbe\u8d56\u5587\u561b\u8f6c\u4e16\u53ca\u5386\u53f2\u5b9a\u5236\u82f1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=haMIsdC3iZwC&pg=PA41 |year=2005 |publisher=\u4e94\u6d32\u4f20\u64ad\u51fa\u7248\u793e |isbn = 978-7-5085-0745-3 |pages=41\u2013}}</ref><ref name=K309>Karmay 2014, p. 309.</ref> The 5th Dalai Lama wanted to use the golden seal of authority right away.<ref name=\"\u9648\u5e86\u82f12005_p41\" /> However, Lobzang Gyatsho noted that \"The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongolian translator but was not a good translation\".

For example, concerning the above-mentioned 'golden seal', the Fifth Dalai Lama comments in ''Dukula'', his autobiography, on leaving China after this courtesy visit to the emperor in 1653, that \"the emperor made his men bring a golden seal for me that had three vertical lines in three parallel scripts: Chinese, Mongolian and Tibetan\". He also criticised the words carved on this gift as being faultily translated into Tibetan, writing that \"The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongol translator but was not a good translation\".<ref name=K309/> Furthermore, when he arrived back in Tibet, he discarded the emperor's famous golden seal and made a new one for important state usage, writing in his autobiography: \"Leaving out the Chinese characters that were on the seal given by the emperor, a new seal was carved for stamping documents that dealt with territorial issues. The first imprint of the seal was offered with prayers to the image of Lokeshvara ...\".<ref>Karmay 2014, p. 402.</ref>\n\n==== Relations with the Qing dynasty ====\nThe 17th-century struggles for domination between the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the various Mongol groups spilled over to involve Tibet because of the Fifth Dalai Lama's strong influence over the Mongols as a result of their general adoption of Tibetan Buddhism and their consequent deep loyalty to the Dalai Lama as their guru. Until 1674, the Fifth Dalai Lama had mediated in [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongol]] affairs whenever they required him to do so, and the [[Kangxi Emperor]], who had succeeded the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661, would accept and confirm his decisions automatically. For the Kangxi Emperor however, the alliance between the Dzungar Mongols and the Tibetans was unsettling because he feared it had the potential to unite all the other Mongol tribes together against the Qing Empire, including those tribes who had already submitted. Therefore, in 1674, the Kangxi Emperor, annoyed by the Fifth's less than full cooperation in quelling a rebellion against the Qing in [[Yunnan]], ceased deferring to him as regards Mongol affairs and started dealing with them directly.<ref name=TN6>Smith 1997, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nIn the same year, 1674, the Dalai Lama, then at the height of his powers and conducting a foreign policy independent of the Qing, caused Mongol troops to occupy the border post of [[Dartsedo]] between Kham and Sichuan, further annoying the Kangxi Emperor who (according to Smith) already considered Tibet as part of the Qing Empire. It also increased Qing suspicion about Tibetan relations with the Mongol groups and led him to seek strategic opportunities to oppose and undermine Mongol influence in Tibet and eventually, within 50 years, to defeat the Mongols militarily and to establish the Qing as sole 'patrons and protectors' of Tibet in their place.<ref name=TN6 />\n\n==== Cultural development ====\nThe time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, who reigned from 1642 to 1682 and founded the government known as the [[Ganden Phodrang]], was a period of rich cultural development.<ref>Snellgrove & Richardson 1968, p. 197.</ref> His reign and that of [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred. The same goes for the great increase in the number of foreign visitors thronging Lhasa during the period as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the 'Great Fifth', as the Tibetans refer to him.<ref>Stein 1972, p. 84\u20135.</ref> The most dynamic and prolific of the early Dalai Lamas, he composed more literary works than all the other Dalai Lamas combined. Writing on a wide variety of subjects he is specially noted for his works on history, classical Indian poetry in Sanskrit and his biographies of notable personalities of his epoch, as well as his own two autobiographies, one spiritual in nature and the other political (see [[Dalai Lama#Further reading|Further Reading]]).<ref name=mull83244>Mullin 1983, p. 244.</ref> He also taught and travelled extensively, reshaped the politics of Central Asia, unified Tibet, conceived and constructed the Potala Palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education.<ref name=mull83244 />\n\n==== Death of the fifth Dalai Lama ====\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama died in 1682. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that the written wills from the fifth Dalai Lama before he died explicitly said his title and authority were from the Emperor of China, and he was subordinate of the Emperor of China\n.<ref name=\"\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997\" />\n\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama's death in 1682 was kept secret for fifteen years by his regent [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]]. He pretended the Dalai Lama was in retreat and ruled on his behalf, secretly selecting the 6th Dalai Lama and presenting him as someone else. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that Desi Sangye Gyatso wanted to consolidate his personal status and power by not reporting the death of the fifth Dalai Lama to the Emperor of China, and also collude with the rebellion group of the Qing dynasty, Mongol [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] tribe in order to counter influence from another Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe in Tibet. Being afraid of prosecution by the Kangxi Emperor of China, Desi Sangye Gyatso explained with fear and trepidation the reason behind his action to the Emperor. In 1705, Desi Sangye Gyatso was killed by [[Lha-bzang Khan]] of the Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe because of his actions including his illegal action of selecting the 6th Dalai Lama. Since the Kangxi Emperor was not happy about Desi Sangye Gyatso's action of not reporting, the Emperor gave [[Lha-bzang Khan]] additional title and golden seal. The Kangxi Emperor also ordered [[Lha-bzang Khan]] to arrest the 6th Dalai Lama and send him to Beijing, the 6th Dalai Lama died when he was en route to Beijing.<ref name=\"\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997\" /> Journalist Thomas Laird argues that it was apparently done so that construction of the Potala Palace could be finished, and it was to prevent Tibet's neighbors, the Mongols and the Qing, from taking advantage of an interregnum in the succession of the Dalai Lamas.{{harv|Laird|2006|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n=== 6th Dalai Lama ===\nThe [[6th Dalai Lama|Sixth Dalai Lama]] (1683\u20131706) was born near [[Tawang]], now in India, and picked out in 1685 but not enthroned until 1697 when the death of the Fifth was announced. After 16 years of study as a novice monk, in 1702 in his 20th year he rejected full ordination and gave up his monk's robes and monastic life, preferring the lifestyle of a layman.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 245\u2013256.</ref><ref>Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, ''Kleine Geschichte Tibets'', M\u00fcnchen 2006, pp. 109\u2013122.</ref>\n\nIn 1703 G\u00fcshi Khan's ruling grandson Tenzin Wangchuk Khan was murdered by his brother [[Lha-bzang Khan|Lhazang Khan]] who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne, but unlike his four predecessors he started interfering directly in Tibetan affairs in Lhasa; he opposed the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] for his deceptions and in the same year, with the support of the Kangxi Emperor, he forced him out of office. Then in 1705, he used the Sixth's escapades as an excuse to seize full control of Tibet. Most Tibetans, though, still supported their Dalai Lama despite his behaviour and deeply resented Lhazang Khan's interference. When Lhazang was requested by the Tibetans to leave Lhasa politics to them and to retire to Kokonor like his predecessors, he quit the city, but only to gather his armies in order to return, capture Lhasa militarily and assume full political control of Tibet.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 121.</ref> The regent was then murdered by Lhazang or his wife, and, in 1706 with the compliance of the Kangxi Emperor the Sixth Dalai Lama was deposed and arrested by Lhazang who considered him to be an impostor set up by the regent. [[Lhazang Khan]], now acting as the only outright foreign ruler that Tibet had ever had, then sent him to Beijing under escort to appear before the emperor but he died mysteriously on the way near [[Lake Qinghai]], ostensibly from illness.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 260\u2013271.</ref><ref name=\"HarperCollins\">Smith 1997, p. 122.</ref>\n\nHaving discredited and deposed the Sixth Dalai Lama, whom he considered an impostor, and having removed the regent, Lhazang Khan pressed the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas to endorse a new Dalai Lama in [[Tsangyang Gyatso]]'s place as the true incarnation of the Fifth. They eventually nominated one Pekar Dzinpa, a monk but also rumored to be Lhazang's son,<ref>McKay 2003, p. 569.</ref> and Lhazang had him installed as the 'real' Sixth Dalai Lama, endorsed by the [[Panchen Lama]] and named [[Yeshe Gyatso]] in 1707.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 274.</ref> This choice was in no way accepted by the Tibetan people, however, nor by Lhazang's princely Mongol rivals in Kokonor who resented his usurpation of the [[Khoshut]] Tibetan throne as well as his meddling in Tibetan affairs. The Kangxi Emperor concurred with them, after sending investigators, initially declining to recognize [[Yeshe Gyatso]]. He did recognize him in 1710, however, after sending a Qing official party to assist Lhazang in 'restoring order'; these were the first Chinese representatives of any sort to officiate in Tibet.<ref name=\"HarperCollins\" /> At the same time, while this puppet 'Dalai Lama' had no political power, the Kangxi Emperor secured from Lhazang Khan in return for this support the promise of regular payments of tribute; this was the first time tribute had been paid to the Manchu by the Mongols in Tibet and the first overt acknowledgment of Qing supremacy over Mongol rule in Tibet.<ref>Richardson 1984, p. 48.</ref>\n\n=== 7th Dalai Lama ===\nIn 1708, in accordance with an indication given by the [[6th Dalai Lama]] when quitting Lhasa a child called Kelzang Gyatso had been born at [[Lithang]] in eastern Tibet who was soon claimed by local Tibetans to be his incarnation. After going into hiding out of fear of Lhazang Khan, he was installed in Lithang monastery. Along with some of the Kokonor Mongol princes, rivals of Lhazang, in defiance of the situation in Lhasa the Tibetans of [[Kham]] duly recognised him as the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] in 1712, retaining his birth-name of [[Kelzang Gyatso]]. For security reasons he was moved to [[Derge]] monastery and eventually, in 1716, now also backed and sponsored by the Kangxi Emperor of China.<ref name=\"Mullin 2001, p.276-281\">Mullin 2001, p. 276\u2013281.</ref> The Tibetans asked Dzungars to bring a true Dalai Lama to Lhasa, but the Manchu Chinese did not want to release Kelsan Gyatso to the Mongol Dzungars. The Regent Taktse Shabdrung and Tibetan officials then wrote a letter to the Manchu Chinese Emperor that they recognized Kelsang Gyatso as the Dalai Lama.

Their force sent to fetch Kelzang Gyatso however was intercepted and destroyed by Qing armies alerted by Lhazang. In Lhasa, the unruly Dzungar not only failed to produce the boy but also went on the rampage, looting and destroying the holy places, abusing the populace, killing hundreds of Nyingma monks, causing chaos and bloodshed and turning their Tibetan allies against them.

On the imperial army's stately passage from [[Kumbum]] to Lhasa with the boy being welcomed adoringly at every stage, [[Khoshut]] Mongols and Tibetans were happy (and well paid) to join and swell its ranks.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 287\u20139.</ref> By the autumn of 1720 the marauding [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongols]] had been vanquished from Tibet and the Qing imperial forces had entered Lhasa triumphantly with the 12-year-old, acting as patrons of the Dalai Lama, liberators of Tibet, allies of the Tibetan anti-Dzungar forces led by [[Khangchenn\u00e9|Kangchenas]] and [[Polhan\u00e9 S\u00f6nam Topgy\u00e9|Polhanas]], and allies of the [[Khoshut]] Mongol princes.

Kelzang Gyatso, too young to participate in politics, studied Buddhism.

This led eventually to the murder of [[Khangchenn\u00e9|Kanchenas]] in 1727 and a civil war that was resolved in 1728 with the canny [[Pholhane|Polhanas]], who had sent for Qing assistance, the victor. When the Qing forces did arrive they punished the losers and exiled the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] to Kham, under the pretence of sending him to Beijing, because his father had assisted the defeated, anti-Qing faction. He studied and taught Buddhism there for the next seven years.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 129\u201330.</ref>\n\n==== Return to Lhasa ====\nIn 1735 he was allowed back to Lhasa to study and teach, but still under strict control, being mistrusted by the Qing, while [[Polhan\u00e9 S\u00f6nam Topgy\u00e9|Polhanas]] ruled [[Central Tibet]] under nominal Qing supervision. Meanwhile, the Qing had promoted the [[Fifth Panchen Lama]] to be a rival leader and reinstated the ''ambans'' and the Lhasa garrison. Polhanas died in 1747 and was succeeded by his son [[Gyurme Namgyal]], the last dynastic ruler of Tibet, who was far less cooperative with the Qing. On the contrary, he built a Tibetan army and started conspiring with the Dzungars to rid Tibet of Qing influence.<ref>Shakabpa 1967, pp. 147\u20138.</ref> In 1750, when the ''ambans'' realised this, they invited him and personally assassinated him and then, despite the Dalai Lama's attempts to calm the angered populace a vengeful Tibetan mob assassinated the ''ambans'' in turn, along with most of their escort.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 130\u2013132.</ref>\n\n==== Restoration as Tibet's political leader ====\nThe Qing sent yet another force 'to restore order' but when it arrived the situation had already been stabilised under the leadership of the [[7th Dalai Lama]] who was now seen to have demonstrated loyalty to the Qing. Just as G\u00fcshi Khan had done with the Fifth Dalai Lama, they therefore helped reconstitute the government with the Dalai Lama presiding over a [[Kashag]] of four Tibetans, reinvesting him with temporal power in addition to his already established spiritual leadership. This arrangement, with a Kashag under the Dalai Lama or his regent, outlasted the Qing dynasty which collapsed in 1912.<ref>Van Schaik 2011, p. 144; Shakabpa 1967, p. 150.</ref> The ''ambans'' and their garrison were also reinstated to observe and to some extent supervise affairs, however, although their influence generally waned with the power of their empire which gradually declined after 1792 along with its influence over Tibet, a decline aided by a succession of corrupt or incompetent ''ambans''.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 137.</ref> Moreover, there was soon no reason for the Qing to fear the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]]; by the time the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] died in 1757 at the age of 49, the entire [[Dzungar people]] had been practically exterminated through years of genocidal campaigns by Qing armies, and deadly smallpox epidemics, with the survivors being forcibly transported into China. Their emptied lands were then awarded to other peoples.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 132\u20133.</ref>\n\nAccording to Mullin, despite living through such violent times Kelzang Gyatso was perhaps 'the most spiritually learned and accomplished of any Dalai Lama', his written works comprising several hundred titles including 'some of Tibet's finest spiritual literary achievements'.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 302, p. 308.</ref> In addition, despite his apparent lack of zeal in politics, Kelzang Gyatso is credited with establishing in 1751 the reformed government of Tibet headed by the Dalai Lama, which continued over 200 years until the 1950s, and then in exile.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 303.</ref> Construction of the [[Norbulingka]], the 'Summer Palace' of the Dalai Lamas in Lhasa was also started during Kelzang Gyatso's reign.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Suhasini Haidar|title=At Lhasa, Tibetans still pray for Dalai Lama's return|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/at-lhasa-tibetans-still-pray-for-dalai-lamas-return/article6367393.ece|accessdate=19 July 2015|newspaper=The Hindu|date=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to The Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka, Tibet|url=http://worldheritage.routes.travel/world-heritage-site/the-potala-palace-jokhang-temple-and-norbulingka-tibet/|publisher=World Heritage|accessdate=19 July 2015|quote=Norbulingka was built in the 1700s by the seventh Dalai Lama and served as the regular dwelling of future Dalai Lamas.

According to Mullin, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] has pointed to certain indications that [[Jamphel Gyatso]] might not have been the incarnation of the [[7th Dalai Lama]] but of Jamyang Chojey, a disciple of [[Tsongkhapa]] and founder of Drepung monastery who was also reputed to be an incarnation of [[Avalokiteshvara]]. In any case, he mainly lived a quiet and unassuming life as a devoted and studious monk, uninvolved in the kind of dramas that had surrounded his predecessors.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 323\u20137.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, [[Jamphel Gyatso]] was also said to possess all the signs of being the true incarnation of the [[Seventh Dalai Lama|Seventh]]. This was also claimed to have been confirmed by many portents clear to the Tibetans and so, in 1762, at the age of 5, he was duly enthroned as the [[Eighth Dalai Lama]] at the [[Potala Palace]].<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 328\u2013332.</ref> At the age of 23 he was persuaded to assume the throne as ruler of Tibet with a [[Regent]] to assist him and after three years of this, when the Regent went to Beijing as ambassador in 1784, he continued to rule solo for a further four years. Feeling unsuited to worldly affairs, however, and unhappy in this role, he then retired from public office to concentrate on religious activities for his remaining 16 years until his death in 1804.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 333\u20134.</ref> He is also credited with the construction of the [[Norbulingka]] 'Summer Palace' started by his predecessor in Lhasa and with ordaining some ten thousand monks in his efforts to foster monasticism.<ref>Mullin 2001 pp. 338\u20139.</ref>\n\n=== 9th to 12th Dalai Lamas ===\nHugh Richardson's summary of the period covering the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas:\n{{quote|After him [the [[8th Dalai Lama]], Jamphel Gyatso], the [[9th Dalai Lama|9th]] and [[10th Dalai Lama]]s died before attaining their majority: one of them is credibly stated to have been murdered and strong suspicion attaches to the other. The [[11th Dalai Lama|11th]] and [[12th Dalai Lama|12th]] were each enthroned but died soon after being invested with power. For 113 years, therefore, supreme authority in Tibet was in the hands of a Lama Regent, except for about two years when a lay noble held office and for short periods of nominal rule by the 11th and 12th Dalai Lamas.{{efn|According to Mullin, Smith and Shakabpa however, the 12th Dalai Lama's Regent, Reting Rinpoche, was deposed in 1862 in a coup by Gyalpo Shetra and Tibet was ruled by despots or assemblies of abbots and ministers for the next eleven years, that is until 1873 when the 12th Dalai Lama assumed power.}}<br />It has sometimes been suggested that this state of affairs was brought about by the Ambans\u2014the Imperial Residents in Tibet\u2014because it would be easier to control the Tibet through a Regent than when a Dalai Lama, with his absolute power, was at the head of the government. That is not true. The regular ebb and flow of events followed its set course. The Imperial Residents in Tibet, after the first flush of zeal in 1750, grew less and less interested and efficient. Tibet was, to them, exile from the urbanity and culture of Peking; and so far from dominating the Regents, the Ambans allowed themselves to be dominated. It was the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans that led to five successive Dalai Lamas being subjected to continuous tutelage. {{harv|Richardson|1984|pp=59\u201360}}}}\n\n[[Thubten Jigme Norbu]], the elder brother of the 14th Dalai Lama, described these unfortunate events as follows, although there are few, if any, indications that any of the four were said to be 'Chinese-appointed imposters':\n{{quote|It is perhaps more than a coincidence that between the seventh and the thirteenth holders of that office, only one reached his majority. The eighth, Gyampal Gyatso, died when he was in his thirties, Lungtog Gyatso when he was eleven, Tsultrim Gyatso at eighteen, Khadrup Gyatso when he was eighteen also, and Krinla Gyatso at about the same age. The circumstances are such that it is very likely that some, if not all, were poisoned, either by loyal Tibetans for being Chinese-appointed impostors, or by the Chinese for not being properly manageable. Many Tibetans think that this was done at the time when the young [Dalai Lama] made his ritual visit to the Lake Lhamtso. ... Each of the four [Dalai Lamas] to die young expired shortly after his visit to the lake. Many said it was because they were not the true reincarnations, but imposters imposed by the Chinese. Others tell stories of how the cooks of the retinue, which in those days included many Chinese, were bribed to put poison in the [Dalai Lama's] food. The 13th [Dalai Lama] did not visit Lhamtso until he was 25 years old. He was adequately prepared by spiritual exercise and he also had faithful cooks. The Chinese were disappointed when he did not die like his predecessors, and he was to live long enough to give them much more cause for regret.{{harv|Norbu|Turnbull|1968|pp.=311\u2013312}}{{efn|According to their biographies, the [[8th Dalai Lama|Eighth, Jamphel Gyatso]] lived to 46 years old, the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth, Lungtok Gyatso]] to 9 years, the [[10th Dalai Lama|Tenth, Tsultrim Gyatso]] to 21, the [[Khedrup Gyatso|Eleventh, Khedrup Gyatso]] to 17 and the [[Trinley Gyatso|Twelfth, Trinley Gyatso]] to 18.}}}}\n\nAccording to Mullin, on the other hand, it is improbable that the [[Manchus]] would have murdered any of these four for being 'unmanageable' since it would have been in their best interests to have strong Dalai Lamas ruling in Lhasa, he argues, agreeing with [[Hugh Edward Richardson|Richardson]] that it was rather \"the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans\" that might have caused the Lamas' early deaths.{{efn|Considering what occurred in Lhasa after the Chinese ''ambans'' murdered [[Gyurme Namgyal]] in 1750, however, the Manchus would have been particularly reluctant to murder a Dalai Lama.}} Further, if Tibetan nobles murdered any of them, it would more likely have been in order to protect or enhance their family interests rather than out of suspicion that the Dalai Lamas were seen as Chinese-appointed imposters as suggested by Norbu. They could also have died from illnesses, possibly contracted from diseases to which they had no immunity, carried to Lhasa by the multitudes of pilgrims visiting from nearby countries for blessings. Finally, from the Buddhist point of view, Mullin says, \"Simply stated, these four Dalai Lamas died young because the world did not have enough good karma to deserve their presence\".<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 343\u20136.</ref>\n\nTibetan historian K. Dhondup, however, in his history ''The Water-Bird and Other Years'', based on the Tibetan minister Surkhang Sawang Chenmo's historical manuscripts,<ref>Dhondup 1986, p. iv.</ref> disagrees with Mullin's opinion that having strong Dalai Lamas in power in Tibet would have been in China's best interests. He notes that many historians are compelled to suspect Manchu foul play in these serial early deaths because the Ambans had such latitude to interfere; the Manchu, he says, \"''to perpetuate their domination over Tibetan affairs, did not desire a Dalai Lama who will ascend the throne and become a strong and capable ruler over his own country and people''\". The life and deeds of the 13th Dalai Lama [in successfully upholding ''de facto'' Tibetan independence from China from 1912 to 1950] serve as the living proof of this argument, he points out.<ref>Dhondup 1986, p. 3.</ref> This account also corresponds with TJ Norbu's observations above.\n\nFinally, while acknowledging the possibility, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] himself doubts they were poisoned. He ascribes the probable cause of these early deaths to negligence, foolishness and lack of proper medical knowledge and attention. \"''Even today''\" he is quoted as saying, \"''when people get sick, some [Tibetans] will say: 'Just do your prayers, you don't need medical treatment.'''\"<ref>Laird 2006, p. 197.</ref>\n\n==== 9th Dalai Lama ====\nBorn in Kham in 1805/6 amidst the usual miraculous signs the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso]] was appointed by the [[7th Panchen Lama]]'s search team at the age of two and enthroned in the Potala in 1808 at an impressive ceremony attended by representatives from China, Mongolia, Nepal and Bhutan.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 346\u20138.</ref><ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 172.</ref> Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain and Wang Jiawei point out that the 9th Dalai Lama was allowed to use the seal of authority given to the late 8th Dalai Lama by the Emperor of China<ref name=\"Wang\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997_p71\">{{cite book|author1=Jiawei Wang|author2=\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e|title=The Historical Status of China's Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak3SQTVS7acC&pg=PA71|year=1997|publisher=\u4e94\u6d32\u4f20\u64ad\u51fa\u7248\u793e|isbn=978-7-80113-304-5|pages=71\u2013}}</ref>\n\nHis second Regent Demo Tulku was the biographer of the 8th and 9th Dalai Lamas and though the 9th died at the age of 9 his biography is as lengthy as those of many of the early Dalai Lamas.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 348.</ref> In 1793 under Manchu pressure Tibet had closed its borders to foreigners,<ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 173.</ref><ref>Richardson 1984, p. 71.</ref> but in 1811 a British Sinologist, [[Thomas Manning (sinologist)|Thomas Manning]] became the first Englishman to visit Lhasa.

After that he was immersed in religious studies under the Panchen Lama, amongst other great masters. Meanwhile, there were court intrigues and ongoing power struggles taking place between the various Lhasa factions, the Regent, the [[Kashag]], the powerful nobles and the abbots and monks of the three great monasteries. The Tsemonling Regent<ref>[http://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Trichen-73-Ngawang-Jampel-Tsultrim-Gyatso/6979|The Second Tsemonling, Ngawang Jampel Tsultrim Gyatso]</ref> became mistrusted and was forcibly deposed, there were machinations, plots, beatings and kidnappings of ministers and so forth, resulting at last in the Panchen Lama being appointed as interim Regent to keep the peace. Eventually the Third Reting Rinpoche was made Regent, and in 1855, Khedrup Gyatso, appearing to be an extremely promising prospect, was requested to take the reins of power at the age of 17.

The respected Reting Rinpoche was recalled once again to act as Regent and requested to lead the search for the next incarnation, the twelfth.<ref name=M361-7 /><ref name=S176-81 />\n\n==== 12th Dalai Lama ====\nIn 1856 a child was born in south [[central Tibet]] amidst all the usual extraordinary signs. He came to the notice of the search team, was investigated, passed the traditional tests and was recognised as the [[12th Dalai Lama]] in 1858. The use of the Chinese [[Golden Urn]] at the insistence of the Regent, who was later accused of being a Chinese lackey, confirmed this choice to the satisfaction of all. Renamed [[Trinley Gyatso]] and enthroned in 1860 the boy underwent 13 years of intensive tutelage and training before stepping up to rule Tibet at the age of 17.<ref name=M367>Mullin 2001, pp. 367\u2013373.</ref>\n\nHis minority seems a time of even deeper Lhasan political intrigue and power struggles than his predecessor's. By 1862 this led to a coup by Wangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against him. Shetra contrived to return, deposed the Regent, who fled to China, and seized power, appointing himself 'Desi' or Prime Minister.<ref name=M367 /> He then ruled with \"absolute power\" for three years,<ref name=S188>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 188\u20139.</ref> quelling a major rebellion in northern Kham in 1863 and re-establishing Tibetan control over significant [[Qing]]-held territory there.<ref name=Sm140>Smith 1997, p. 140.</ref> Shetra died in 1864 and the [[Kashag]] re-assumed power. The retired 76th [[Ganden Tripa]], Khyenrab Wangchuk, was appointed as 'Regent' but his role was limited to supervising and mentoring Trinley Gyatso.<ref name=M367 /><ref name=S188 />\n\nIn 1868 Shetra's coup organiser, a semi-literate [[Ganden]] monk named Palden Dondrup, seized power by another coup and ruled as a cruel despot for three years, putting opponents to death by having them 'sewn into fresh animal skins and thrown in the river'.<ref name=S188 /> In 1871, at the request of officials outraged after Dondrup had done just that with one minister and imprisoned several others, he in turn was ousted and committed suicide after a counter-coup coordinated by the supposedly powerless 'Regent' Khyenrab Wangchuk.<ref name=S188 /> As a result of this action this venerable old Regent, who died the next year, is fondly remembered by Tibetans as saviour of the Dalai Lama and the nation. The Kashag and the Tsongdu or National Assembly were re-instated, and, presided over by a Dalai Lama or his Regent, ruled without further interruption until 1959.<ref name=M367 />\n\nAccording to Smith, however, during Trinley Gyatso's minority, the Regent was deposed in 1862 for abuse of authority and closeness with China, by an alliance of monks and officials called ''Gandre Drungche'' (Ganden and Drepung Monks Assembly); this body then ruled Tibet for ten years until dissolved, when a National Assembly of monks and officials called the ''Tsongdu'' was created and took over. Smith makes no mention of Shetra or Dondrup acting as usurpers and despots in this period.<ref name=Sm140 />\n\nIn any case, Trinley Gyatso died within three years of assuming power. In 1873, at the age of 20 \"he suddenly became ill and passed away\".<ref name=M367 /> On the cause of his early death, accounts diverge. Mullin relates an interesting theory, based on cited Tibetan sources: out of concern for the monastic tradition, Trinley Gyatso chose to die and reincarnate as the [[13th Dalai Lama]], rather than taking the option of marrying a woman called Rigma Tsomo from Kokonor and leaving an heir to \"oversee Tibet's future\".<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 373\u2013375.</ref> Shakabpa on the other hand, without citing sources, notes that Trinley Gyatso was influenced and manipulated by two close acquaintances who were subsequently accused of having a hand in his fatal illness and imprisoned, tortured and exiled as a result.<ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 191.</ref>\n\n=== 13th Dalai Lama ===\n[[File:Throne awaiting Dalai Lama's return. Summer residence Nechung. 1993.JPG|upright|thumb|Throne awaiting Dalai Lama's return. Summer residence of 14th Dalai Lama, [[Nechung]], Tibet.]]\n\nThe [[13th Dalai Lama]] assumed ruling power from the monasteries, which previously had great influence on the Regent, in 1895. Due to his two periods of exile in 1904\u20131909 to escape the British invasion of 1904, and from 1910 to 1912 to escape a Chinese invasion, he became well aware of the complexities of international politics and was the first Dalai Lama to become aware of the importance of foreign relations. After his return from exile in India and [[Sikkim]] during January 1913, he assumed control of foreign relations and dealt directly with the [[Maharaja]], with the British Political officer in Sikkim and with the king of [[Nepal]] \u2013 rather than letting the Kashag or parliament do it. {{harv|Sheel|1989|pp=24, 29}}\n\nThe Thirteenth issued a Declaration of Independence for his kingdom in [[\u00dc-Tsang]] from China during the summer of 1912 and standardised a Tibetan flag, though no other sovereign state recognized Tibetan independence. {{harv|Sheel|1989|p=20}} He expelled the [[amban]]s and all Chinese civilians in the country and instituted many measures to modernise Tibet. These included provisions to curb excessive demands on peasants for provisions by the monasteries and tax evasion by the nobles, setting up an independent police force, the abolition of the death penalty, extension of secular education, and the provision of electricity throughout the city of Lhasa in the 1920s. {{harv|Norbu|Turnbull|1968|pp=317\u2013318}} He died in 1933.\n\n=== 14th Dalai Lama ===\nThe [[14th Dalai Lama]] was born on 6 July 1935 on a straw mat in a cowshed to a farmer's family in a remote part of Tibet.<ref>Laird 2006, p. 261.</ref> According to most Western journalistic sources<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sturcke|first1=James|title=Dalai Lama defies China over successor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/27/china.jamessturcke|accessdate=29 June 2017|agency=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Nagle|first1=Jeanne|title=The Dalai Lama: Spiritual Leader of the Tibetan People|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9I0gBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT9&lpg=PT9&dq=dalai+lama+family+humble+origins#v=onepage&q=dalai%20lama%20family%20humble%20origins&f=false|accessdate=29 June 2017|isbn=9781622754410|date=15 July 2014}}</ref> he was born into a humble family of farmers as one of 16 children.<ref name=\"Committee2008\">{{cite book|author=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Foreign Affairs Committee|title=Human Rights Annual Report 2007: Ninth Report of Session 2007\u201308, Report, Together with Formal Minutes, Oral and Written Evidence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7dJbld9PzQC&pg=PA124|date=20 July 2008|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-215-52193-4|pages=124\u2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=\u7d71\u4e00\u8ad6\u58c7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ymhKAQAAIAAJ|year=2008|publisher=\u7d71\u4e00\u8ad6\u58c7\u96dc\u8a8c\u793e}} |quote=\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1,\u6c11\u4e3b\u6539\u9769\u524d,\u5341\u56db\u4e16\u8fbe\u8d56\u5587\u561b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5728\u897f\u85cf\u5360\u6709 27 \u5ea7\u5e84\u56ed\u3001 30 \u4e2a\u7267\u573a,\u62e5\u6709\u519c\n\u7267\u5974 6000 \u591a\u4eba</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=\u5341\u56db\u4e16\u8fbe\u8d56\u5587\u561b|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etOVRV2Lr6oC&pg=PA23|year=1977|isbn = 9787801132987|author1 = \u53f8\u4ec1|author2 = \u683c\u65fa}} |quote=\u62c9\u8428\u897f\u531750\u516c\u91cc\u5904\u7684\u5806\u9f99\u5fb7\u5e86\u53bf\u8272\u6751\uff0c\u6c11\u4e3b\u6539\u9769\u524d\u662f\u5341\u56db\u4e16\u8fbe\u8d56\u5587\u561b\u5bb6\u7684\u5e84\u56ed\u3002\u5f53\u65f6\u5e84\u56e9\u91cc20\u6237\u5dee\u5df4(\u519c\u5974)\u3002</ref> The 14th Dalai Lama had become the joint most popular world leader by 2013, (tied with Barack Obama), according to a poll conducted by [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris Interactive]] of New York, which sampled public opinion in the US and six major European countries.<ref name=Harrispoll>{{cite web|author1=Regina A.

The film was produced by [[Warner Bros.

Based on [[DC Comics]] characters, the film stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent countercultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying [[Gotham City]]. [[Robert De Niro]], [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Frances Conroy]], [[Brett Cullen]], [[Glenn Fleshler]], [[Bill Camp]], [[Shea Whigham]], and [[Marc Maron]] appear in supporting roles.\n\n''Joker'' premiered at the [[76th Venice International Film Festival]] on August 31, 2019, where it won the [[Golden Lion]], and was released in the United States on October 4, 2019.

In ''Atlas Reactor'', the player took the role of a Freelancer in the [[megacity]] of ''Atlas''. The game was released in October 2016<ref name=\"releasedate\" /> and it shut down on June 28, 2019.<ref name=\"shutdown\">{{cite web |title=An Important Announcement About Atlas Reactor |url=https://www.atlasreactorgame.com/en/2019/04/an-important-announcement-about-atlas-reactor/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601062618/https://www.atlasreactorgame.com/en/2019/04/an-important-announcement-about-atlas-reactor/ |archivedate=2019-06-01 |date=2019-04-17 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nWith the exception of custom game modes, matches in Atlas Reactor are 4-on-4, [[player versus player]] , [[turn-based tactics]] battles. Players can die and [[respawn]] indefinitely, but teams win by being the first to five kills or by having the most kills after 20 turns (or more for sudden death overtime). Turns are divided into two modes: Decision Mode and Resolution Mode. In the decision mode, players have 20 seconds to coordinate tactics, select actions, and lock them in. In the Resolution Mode, these action resolve over four phases: the Prep phase allows for setting traps, placing shields, and casting buff/debuffs before any movement or damage is done; the Dash phase contains all dodges and charges which may deal damage; the Blast phase is for shooting, blasting, and any other stationary attacks, followed by [[knock-back]] attacks, which render the targets unable to move during the Move phase; the Move phase allows for player movement after all other actions with more movement granted to those who used no (or free) actions. Within each phase, all players actions are calculated simultaneously but are rendered sequentially for the player. Therefore, a character seen dying before their action will remain standing until it is completed.<ref name=\"playerguide\" />\n\n===Seasons===\nEach Season is a period of real time during which the player can level up an account, gaining Season Levels. It also contains multiple chapters, each with its own quests, called Missions, that when completed, unlock animated sprites which can be used in-game for free, several times each match. A user's season level resets to zero at the beginning of each new season with the balance adding to the user's overall Reactor Level. There are also daily missions, which are selected from a choice of three when logging in. These missions provide varying amounts of experience based on difficulty and how often the particular mission has been chosen. Season 1 began with the launch and Season two rolled out January 17, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n===Backstory===\n''Atlas'' is a megacity populated with humans, hybrids, and robots controlled by powerful [[Trust (business)|Trusts]]. Freelancers fulfill contracts for their trusts to maintain control over the Atlas Reactor - a technologically advanced energy source that powers the megacity and its inhabitants.<ref name=playerguide>{{cite web|url=http://webcdn.triongames.com/atlasreactor/AtlasReactor_Guide.pdf |title=Atlas Reactor Guide}}</ref><ref name=trustwarsblog>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlasreactorgame.com/en/2016/07/trust-wars-beta |title=Trust Wars - Beta}}</ref> There were once thirteen such reactors monitored and controlled by the Global Artificial Intelligence Agent (GAIA). Humanity was in a [[golden age]] without poverty, drought, famine, or disease. Ultimately, they were able to conquer death itself. However, after 150 years of prosperity, GAIA mysteriously departed. This led to a [[cascading failure]] of reactors beginning with Tethys and ending with Hyperion thus leaving Atlas as the only reactor on the planet. As is always the case when resources are limited, war broke out. The Titan War saw soldiers, war machines, and refugees battling for control of the Reactor for almost 30 years until the forces of Atlas, Hyperion, and Oceanus were able to unite to end the struggle. As victors, they formed an uneasy alliance and divided the city of Atlas between them.<ref name=World>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlasreactorgame.com/en/world/ |title=Welcome to Atlas |accessdate=2017-01-21}}</ref>\n\n===Trusts===\n'''Omni'''\n\n''Omni Trust'' was born in the heart of the Atlas reactor. They seek to reclaim the glory of the \"Immortal Age\" not just for themselves, but for all mankind.

(Meridian, Rampart, Blackburn, Oz, Garrison, Brynn)\n\n===Characters===\n'''Firepower'''\n\n''Blackburn'' is the former leader of the Warbotics special ops squad, Ares 1. After going AWOL, he has returned to the fray as a mechanized super soldier. Weapons include rifle, grenades, and aerial support.\n\n''Celeste'' (Helio Corps) is a thief for hire. She claims to have infiltrated all three of the original trusts. Weapons: Nanite grapplers, smoke bombs, and proximity traps.\n\n''Elle'' (Omni) is rumored the highest ranking enforcer of Omni Trust, Agent L. Her primary weapon is a custom plasma gun and is supported by a remote-firing drone.\n\n''Gremolitions Inc.'' (EvoS) consists of two vat-grown gremunks. They somehow outlived their expiration date and were subsequently put to work for EvoS. Gremolitions Inc. focuses on one thing: bombs.\n\n''Grey'' is the wealthy heiress of Hawk Aviation. After an attack killed her family and left her gravely wounded, Grey used her fortune to hunt the monsters in the depths of Atlas. Weapons: Crossbow and attack drone.\n\n''Juno'' (Omni) was hired by Omni as their head of security after recognizing her skills at dispatching enemies. Her Omni-provided weaponry include twin cannons, shields, and explosive tethers.\n\n''Kaigin'' is believed to have gained the power to warp through the reactor's energy fields by a nanite infusion as part of Omni's Project Nidus. In battle, he relies on his daggers and shuriken.\n\n''Lockwood'' (Helio Corps) became the go-between for the trusts after they took control of Atlas. His emergence as the first freelancer prompted the creation of a wider Freelancing Initiative, opening the doors for any others who wished to gain access to resurrection.\n\n''Nix'' (EvoS) is shrouded in mystery to the point that not even the employees of EvoS are sure he exists. His invisibility makes him the ultimate killer along with his sniper rifle and overwatch drone.\n\n''Oz'' is a malfunctioning toy from Warbotics subsidiary Toybotics. Originally sold as \"Jimmy 6 and His Magic Tricks\" he is now a fully endorsed freelancer. Weapons: Lasers and holographic afterimages.\n\n''PUP'' (Helio Corps) is a prototype stealth spy-bot who was adopted and subsequently modded by Zuki. His diverse weaponry include giant jaws, a grappling leash, rocket boosters, invisibility, and a powerful sound system.\n\n''Zuki'' (Helio Corps) is a modder and machinist who was formerly under the care of Lockwood. She has a penchant for all things explosive. This is reflected in her weapon loadout of various missiles and sticky bombs.\n\n'''Frontline'''\n\n''Asana'' was another participant in Omni's Project Nidus. Her nanite infusion allows her to create protective force fields as she wields an ancient sword forged in the heart of the reactor.\n\n''Brynn'' (Helio United) hails from the lands around Hyperion where her family once ruled. It is believed that she joined the fight as a freelancer due to the fall of the Warbotics Trust. Weapons: Spear, daggers, and shield.\n\n''Garrison'' (Omni) is a war hero who was granted the first resurrection contract sponsored by Warbotics. His Ballistic Exo Suit provides him weapons such as a piston powered punch, arm cannon, missile barrage, jet pack, and aerial drop shock pod.\n\n''Phaedra'' (EvoS) is an abomination thrown together from leftover EvoS experiments. She lives under Atlas terrorizing the citizens with her seismic attacks and insect swarms.\n\n''Rampart'' (Helio Corps) is a warbot designed with a limited AI to circumvent the ban put in place after GAIA's desertion. He is armed with a telescoping blade and an impenetrable shield.\n\n''Rask'' (EvoS) has gained the most popularity of any of EvoS's creations with plushies and drinks bearing his name and likeness. His body infused with \"Power Juice\", he can heal and spray enemies when not rending them with his claws.\n\n''Titus'' (Helio Corps) comes from the wastes outside of Atlas where it is rumored that nothing lives. He battled countless beasts in order to make it to the city where he battles with his sword and dagger.\n\n'''Support'''\n\n''Aurora'' (Omni) appeared from the reactor soon after the mysterious disappearance of an Omni scientist studying Quark. Her atomic control over matter allows her to simultaneously heal allies and damage foes.\n\n''Dr. Finn'' (EvoS) is a scientist studying reactor-powered fish hybridization who, when the supply of volunteers ran dry, subjected himself to his experiments. His load-out includes a water cannon and electric eels.\n\n''Helio'' (Helio Corps) is a genius inventor recruited my Omni and later tasked with founding a new trust to further develop reactor-powered technology. Helio supports his team with shields, black holes, disruption walls and a seismic hammer.\n\nDr. ''Orion'' Strand (Omni) was inspired by the rematerialization of Aurora and sought to create a robotic suit that would allow him to harness the energy of the reactor. The results were, to some degree, successful as we now has the unique ability to absorb damage as energy and blast enemies with it.\n\n''Quark'' (EvoS) is an anomaly that exploded forth from Atlas with abilities similar to the reactor itself. Nobody is entirely sure what Quark is or what its motives are. Quark can bond to allies and enemies, rearranging their atoms to suit its needs.\n\n''Su-Ren'' (Omni) is actually an AI descended from GAIA. She now runs Omni's Project Nidus, guiding and training the warriors in the wastes just outside the city. Her powers allow her to quickly dash around the map doling heals, damage, buffs, debuffs, and shields while also laying damage with her staff.\n\n''Khita'' was raised in the Waste and mentored by Titus. She is a skilled archer who uses specialized arrows and flechettes to deal damage and support her allies.<ref name=Game />\n\n==Development==\n\nAccording to lead designer Will Cook, the game's concept draws inspiration from [[XCOM: Enemy Unknown]], [[League of Legends]], and [[tabletop games]] such as [[Warhammer 40,000]].

Players can die and [[respawn]] indefinitely, but teams win by being the first to five kills or by having the most kills after 20 turns (or more for sudden death overtime). Turns are divided into two modes: Decision Mode and Resolution Mode. In the decision mode, players have 20 seconds to coordinate tactics, select actions, and lock them in. In the Resolution Mode, these action resolve over four phases: the Prep phase allows for setting traps, placing shields, and casting buff/debuffs before any movement or damage is done; the Dash phase contains all dodges and charges which may deal damage; the Blast phase is for shooting, blasting, and any other stationary attacks, followed by [[knock-back]] attacks, which render the targets unable to move during the Move phase; the Move phase allows for player movement after all other actions with more movement granted to those who used no (or free) actions. Within each phase, all players actions are calculated simultaneously but are rendered sequentially for the player. Therefore, a character seen dying before their action will remain standing until it is completed.<ref name=\"playerguide\" />\n\n===Seasons===\nEach Season is a period of real time during which the player can level up an account, gaining Season Levels. It also contains multiple chapters, each with its own quests, called Missions, that when completed, unlock animated sprites which can be used in-game for free, several times each match. A user's season level resets to zero at the beginning of each new season with the balance adding to the user's overall Reactor Level. There are also daily missions, which are selected from a choice of three when logging in. These missions provide varying amounts of experience based on difficulty and how often the particular mission has been chosen. Season 1 began with the launch and Season two rolled out January 17, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n===Backstory===\n''Atlas'' is a megacity populated with humans, hybrids, and robots controlled by powerful [[Trust (business)|Trusts]]. Freelancers fulfill contracts for their trusts to maintain control over the Atlas Reactor - a technologically advanced energy source that powers the megacity and its inhabitants.<ref name=playerguide>{{cite web|url=http://webcdn.triongames.com/atlasreactor/AtlasReactor_Guide.pdf |title=Atlas Reactor Guide}}</ref><ref name=trustwarsblog>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlasreactorgame.com/en/2016/07/trust-wars-beta |title=Trust Wars - Beta}}</ref> There were once thirteen such reactors monitored and controlled by the Global Artificial Intelligence Agent (GAIA). Humanity was in a [[golden age]] without poverty, drought, famine, or disease. Ultimately, they were able to conquer death itself. However, after 150 years of prosperity, GAIA mysteriously departed. This led to a [[cascading failure]] of reactors beginning with Tethys and ending with Hyperion thus leaving Atlas as the only reactor on the planet. As is always the case when resources are limited, war broke out. The Titan War saw soldiers, war machines, and refugees battling for control of the Reactor for almost 30 years until the forces of Atlas, Hyperion, and Oceanus were able to unite to end the struggle. As victors, they formed an uneasy alliance and divided the city of Atlas between them.<ref name=World>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlasreactorgame.com/en/world/ |title=Welcome to Atlas |accessdate=2017-01-21}}</ref>\n\n===Trusts===\n'''Omni'''\n\n''Omni Trust'' was born in the heart of the Atlas reactor.
