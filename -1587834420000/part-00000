Under the ownership of [[James Johnstone (publisher)|James Johnstone]], ''The Standard'' became a morning paper from 29 June 1857. ''The Evening Standard'' was published from 11 June 1859. ''The Standard'' gained eminence for its detailed foreign news, notably its reporting of events of the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, all contributing to a rise in circulation.<ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' Eleventh Edition; Cambridge University Press, 1911, Vol. XIX, Mun to Oddfellows; Article on Newspapers, pp.544\u2013581.</ref> By the end of the 19th century, the evening edition eclipsed its morning counterpart.\n\nBoth ''The Standard'' and the ''Evening Standard'' were acquired by <!-- Not a baronet until 1916. -->[[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|C.

It became a staunchly Conservative paper, harshly attacking Labour in 1945 in a high-profile campaign that backfired. In the 1960s, the paper was upstaged by ''[[The Evening News (London newspaper)|The Evening News]]'', which sold over 1 million copies nightly. During the decade, the paper also began to publish the comic strip ''[[Modesty Blaise]]'', which bolstered its sales throughout the 1970s. ''The Evening Standard'' ceased publishing on Saturdays on 30 Nov 1974, when it still produced six editions daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://47shoelane.wordpress.com/galleries/terriboules|title=Where are they now, those Saturday People?|website=47shoelane|date=1 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, [[Express Newspapers]] merged the ''Standard'' with [[Associated Newspapers]]' ''[[Evening News (London)|Evening News]]'' in a [[Joint Operating Agreement]]. The new paper was known as the ''New Standard'' until 1985, when Associated Newspapers bought out the remaining stake, turning it into ''The Standard''. In 1987 the ''Evening News'' was briefly revived to compete with Robert Maxwell's ''[[London Daily News]]'', but was reabsorbed into ''The Standard'' later that year, after the collapse of Maxwell's paper.

This has moved from more general articles to concentrate on glamour, with features on the rich, powerful and famous. On Wednesdays, selected areas offer a free copy of the ''Homes & Property'' supplement, edited by Janice Morley, which includes London property listings as well as articles from lifestyle journalists including Barbara Chandler, Katie Law and [[Alison Cork]].\n\nAn entertainment guide supplement ''Metro Life'' (previously called ''Hot Tickets'') was launched in September 2002. This was a what's-on guide with listings of cinemas and theatres in and around London, and was given away on Thursdays. It was discontinued on 1 September 2005.\n\nThe paper also supplies occasional CDs and DVDs for promotions. It also gives Londoners a chance to win exclusive tickets to film premieres and sports tournament tickets, such as the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] Ladies Singles Final.\n\n== Website ==\nThe newspaper's ''This Is London'' website carries some of the stories from the ''Evening Standard'' and promotions, reviews and competitions. It also includes a number of blogs by ''Evening Standard'' writers, such as restaurant critic [[Charles Campion]], theatre critic [[Kieron Quirke]] and music critic David Smyth.

Under the ownership of [[James Johnstone (publisher)|James Johnstone]], ''The Standard'' became a morning paper from 29 June 1857. ''The Evening Standard'' was published from 11 June 1859. ''The Standard'' gained eminence for its detailed foreign news, notably its reporting of events of the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, all contributing to a rise in circulation.<ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' Eleventh Edition; Cambridge University Press, 1911, Vol. XIX, Mun to Oddfellows; Article on Newspapers, pp.544\u2013581.</ref> By the end of the 19th century, the evening edition eclipsed its morning counterpart.\n\nBoth ''The Standard'' and the ''Evening Standard'' were acquired by <!-- Not a baronet until 1916. -->[[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|C.

It became a staunchly Conservative paper, harshly attacking Labour in 1945 in a high-profile campaign that backfired. In the 1960s, the paper was upstaged by ''[[The Evening News (London newspaper)|The Evening News]]'', which sold over 1 million copies nightly. During the decade, the paper also began to publish the comic strip ''[[Modesty Blaise]]'', which bolstered its sales throughout the 1970s. ''The Evening Standard'' ceased publishing on Saturdays on 30 Nov 1974, when it still produced six editions daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://47shoelane.wordpress.com/galleries/terriboules|title=Where are they now, those Saturday People?|website=47shoelane|date=1 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, [[Express Newspapers]] merged the ''Standard'' with [[Associated Newspapers]]' ''[[Evening News (London)|Evening News]]'' in a [[Joint Operating Agreement]]. The new paper was known as the ''New Standard'' until 1985, when Associated Newspapers bought out the remaining stake, turning it into ''The Standard''. In 1987 the ''Evening News'' was briefly revived to compete with Robert Maxwell's ''[[London Daily News]]'', but was reabsorbed into ''The Standard'' later that year, after the collapse of Maxwell's paper. In 1988 the ''Evening Standard'' included the by-line \"Incorporating the 'Evening News'\", which remained until the paper's sale in 2009.\n\n=== Lebedev takeover ===\nOn 21 January 2009, the Russian businessman and former [[KGB]] agent [[Alexander Lebedev]] and his son [[Evgeny Lebedev]], owners of ''[[The Independent]]'', agreed to purchase control of the newspaper at \u00a31 for 64 percent ownership.<ref name=Lebedev/><ref name=BBC>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7841891.stm|title=Ex-KGB Spy Buys UK Paper for \u00a31|work=BBC News|date=21 January 2009|accessdate=21 January 2009}}</ref> A few years earlier, 12 percent of the paper was sold to Justin Shaw and Geordie Greig.

This has moved from more general articles to concentrate on glamour, with features on the rich, powerful and famous. On Wednesdays, selected areas offer a free copy of the ''Homes & Property'' supplement, edited by Janice Morley, which includes London property listings as well as articles from lifestyle journalists including Barbara Chandler, Katie Law and [[Alison Cork]].\n\nAn entertainment guide supplement ''Metro Life'' (previously called ''Hot Tickets'') was launched in September 2002. This was a what's-on guide with listings of cinemas and theatres in and around London, and was given away on Thursdays. It was discontinued on 1 September 2005.\n\nThe paper also supplies occasional CDs and DVDs for promotions. It also gives Londoners a chance to win exclusive tickets to film premieres and sports tournament tickets, such as the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] Ladies Singles Final.\n\n== Website ==\nThe newspaper's ''This Is London'' website carries some of the stories from the ''Evening Standard'' and promotions, reviews and competitions. It also includes a number of blogs by ''Evening Standard'' writers, such as restaurant critic [[Charles Campion]], theatre critic [[Kieron Quirke]] and music critic David Smyth.
