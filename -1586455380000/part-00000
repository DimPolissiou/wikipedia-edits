Her body was discovered before dawn on Sunday, August 5. She was a major [[sex symbol]] and one of the most popular Hollywood stars during the 1950s and early 1960s. She was a [[billing (filmmaking)|top-billed]] actress for a decade, and her films had grossed $200&nbsp;million by the time of her death.<ref name=LATimeslitman>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-marilyn-monroe-19620806-story.html|title=From the Archives: Marilyn Monroe Dies; Pills Blamed|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 6, 1962|accessdate=October 21, 2015|first1=Howard|last1=Hertel|first2=Don|last2=Neff}}</ref>\n\nMonroe had suffered from [[mental illness]] and [[substance abuse]] for several years prior to her death, and she had not completed a film since ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'', which was released in 1961. She had spent 1961 preoccupied with her various health problems, and in April 1962 had begun filming ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' for [[20th Century Fox]], but the studio fired her in early June. The studio publicly blamed her for the production's problems, and in the weeks preceding her death, Monroe attempted to repair her public image by giving several interviews to high-profile publications. She also began negotiations with Fox on being re-hired for ''Something's Got to Give'' and for starring roles in other productions.\n\nMonroe spent the last day of her life, Saturday, August 4, at her home in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]]. She was accompanied at various times by publicist Patricia Newcomb, housekeeper Eunice Murray, photographer [[Lawrence Schiller]] and psychiatrist [[Ralph Greenson]]. At Greenson's request, Murray stayed overnight to keep Monroe company. At approximately 3 a.m. on Sunday, August 5, she noticed that Monroe had locked herself in her bedroom and appeared unresponsive when she looked into the bedroom through a window. Murray alerted Greenson, who arrived soon after, entered the room by breaking a window, and found Monroe dead. Her death was officially ruled a probable suicide by the [[Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner|Los Angeles County coroner's office]], based on precedents of her overdosing and being prone to mood swings and suicidal ideation. No evidence of foul play was found, and accidental overdose was ruled out due to the large amount of barbiturates she had ingested. On August 8, [[Joe DiMaggio]] directed her funeral at the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]], where she was interred in a crypt at the Corridor of Memories.\n\nDespite the coroner's findings, several conspiracy theories suggesting murder or accidental overdose have been proposed since the mid-1960s. Many of these involve President [[John F. Kennedy]] and his brother, [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]], as well as union leader [[Jimmy Hoffa]] and mob boss [[Sam Giancana]]. Due to the prevalence of these theories in the media, the office of the [[Los Angeles County District Attorney]] reviewed the case in 1982, but found no evidence to support them and did not disagree with the findings of the original investigation.\n\n==Background==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = Marilyn Monroe Happy Birthday Mr President 1962.jpg\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Monroe performing at President [[John F.

By 1960, this behavior was adversely affecting her career. For example, although she was author [[Truman Capote]]'s preferred choice to play Holly Golightly in the [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', [[Paramount Pictures]] declined to cast her due to fear that she would complicate the film's production.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=335}} The two films Monroe completed in the 1960s, ''[[Let's Make Love]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961), were both critical and commercial failures.{{sfnm|1a1=Riese|1a2=Hitchens|1y=1988|1p=270|2a1=Solomon|2y=1988|2p=139|3a1=Spoto|3y=2001|3pp=435-445;456|4a1=Churchwell|4y=2004|4p=266|5a1=Banner|5y=2012|5pp=353-356;361}} During the filming of the latter she had had to spend a week [[drug detoxification|detox]]ing in a hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Riese|1a2=Hitchens|1y=1988|1p=270|2a1=Solomon|2y=1988|2p=139|3a1=Spoto|3y=2001|3pp=435-445;456|4a1=Churchwell|4y=2004|4p=266|5a1=Banner|5y=2012|5pp=353-356;361}} Her third marriage, to author [[Arthur Miller]], also ended in divorce in January 1961.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=450\u2013455}}\n\nInstead of working, Monroe spent a large part of 1961 preoccupied with health problems and did not work on any new film projects. She underwent surgery for her [[endometriosis]] and a [[cholecystectomy]], and spent four weeks in hospital care \u2013 including a brief stint in a [[mental ward]] \u2013 for depression.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=453, for a new role, 466\u2013467 for operations, 456\u2013464 for psychiatric hospital stays}}{{efn|Monroe first admitted herself to the [[Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic]] in New York, at the suggestion of her psychiatrist Marianne Kris.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=456\u2013459}} Kris later stated that her choice of hospital was a mistake: Monroe was placed on a ward meant for severely mentally ill people with [[psychosis]], where she was locked in a [[padded cell]] and was not allowed to move to a more suitable ward or to leave the hospital.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=456\u2013459}} Monroe was finally able to leave the hospital after three days with the help of her ex-husband [[Joe DiMaggio]], and moved to the [[Columbia University Medical Center]], spending a further 23 days there.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=456\u2013459}}}} Later in 1961, she moved back to Los Angeles after six years in Manhattan; she purchased a Spanish [[hacienda]]-style house at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=465\u2013470, 484\u2013485}} In early 1962, she received a \"World Film Favorite\" [[Golden Globe award]] and began to shoot a new film for 20th Century Fox, ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'', a remake of ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940).{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=495\u2013496|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=74\u201375}}\n\nDays before filming began, Monroe caught [[sinusitis]]; Fox was advised to postpone the production, but the advice was not heeded and filming began on schedule in late April.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=524\u2013525|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=391\u2013392|3a1=Rollyson|3y=2014|3pp=264\u2013272}} Monroe was too ill to work for the majority of the next six weeks, but despite confirmations by multiple doctors, the studio tried to pressure her by publicly alleging that she was faking it.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=524\u2013525|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=391\u2013392|3a1=Rollyson|3y=2014|3pp=264\u2013272}} On May 19, she took a break from filming to sing \"[[Happy Birthday, Mr. President|Happy Birthday]]\" on stage at President [[John F.

She experienced severe fears and frequent depressions. Mood changes were abrupt and unpredictable. Among symptoms of disorganization, sleep disturbance was prominent, for which she had been taking sedative drugs for many years. She was thus familiar with and experienced in the use of sedative drugs and well aware of their dangers. [...] In our investigation we have learned that Miss Monroe had often expressed wishes to give up, to withdraw, and even to die. On more than one occasion in the past, she had made a suicide attempt, using sedative drugs. On these occasions, she had called for help and had been rescued.\nIt is our opinion that the same pattern was repeated on the evening of Aug. 4 except for the rescue. It has been our practice with similar information collected in other cases in the past to recommend a certification for such deaths as probable suicide. Additional clews<!--written this way in the source, do not change into \"clues\"--> for suicide provided by the physical evidence are the high level of barbiturates and chloral hydrate in the blood which, with other evidence from the autopsy, indicates the probable ingestion of a large amount of drugs within a short period of time: the completely empty bottle of Nembutal, the prescription for which (25 capsules) was filled the day before the ingestion, and the locked door to the bedroom, which was unusual.<ref name=tribunecoroner/></blockquote>\n\nIn the 1970s, claims surfaced that Monroe's death was a murder and not suicide.

He asserted that Monroe was murdered by the CIA due to her association with Robert F.

She had spent 1961 preoccupied with her various health problems, and in April 1962 had begun filming ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' for [[20th Century Fox]], but the studio fired her in early June. The studio publicly blamed her for the production's problems, and in the weeks preceding her death, Monroe attempted to repair her public image by giving several interviews to high-profile publications. She also began negotiations with Fox on being re-hired for ''Something's Got to Give'' and for starring roles in other productions.\n\nMonroe spent the last day of her life, Saturday, August 4, at her home in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]]. She was accompanied at various times by publicist Patricia Newcomb, housekeeper Eunice Murray, photographer [[Lawrence Schiller]] and psychiatrist [[Ralph Greenson]]. At Greenson's request, Murray stayed overnight to keep Monroe company. At approximately 3 a.m. on Sunday, August 5, she noticed that Monroe had locked herself in her bedroom and appeared unresponsive when she looked into the bedroom through a window. Murray alerted Greenson, who arrived soon after, entered the room by breaking a window, and found Monroe dead. Her death was officially ruled a probable suicide by the [[Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner|Los Angeles County coroner's office]], based on precedents of her overdosing and being prone to mood swings and suicidal ideation. No evidence of foul play was found, and accidental overdose was ruled out due to the large amount of barbiturates she had ingested. On August 8, [[Joe DiMaggio]] directed her funeral at the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]], where she was interred in a crypt at the Corridor of Memories.\n\nDespite the coroner's findings, several conspiracy theories suggesting murder or accidental overdose have been proposed since the mid-1960s. Many of these involve President [[John F. Kennedy]] and his brother, [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]], as well as union leader [[Jimmy Hoffa]] and mob boss [[Sam Giancana]]. Due to the prevalence of these theories in the media, the office of the [[Los Angeles County District Attorney]] reviewed the case in 1982, but found no evidence to support them and did not disagree with the findings of the original investigation.\n\n==Background==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = Marilyn Monroe Happy Birthday Mr President 1962.jpg\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Monroe performing at President [[John F.

By 1960, this behavior was adversely affecting her career. For example, although she was author [[Truman Capote]]'s preferred choice to play Holly Golightly in the [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', [[Paramount Pictures]] declined to cast her due to fear that she would complicate the film's production.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=335}} The two films Monroe completed in the 1960s, ''[[Let's Make Love]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961), were both critical and commercial failures.{{sfnm|1a1=Riese|1a2=Hitchens|1y=1988|1p=270|2a1=Solomon|2y=1988|2p=139|3a1=Spoto|3y=2001|3pp=435-445;456|4a1=Churchwell|4y=2004|4p=266|5a1=Banner|5y=2012|5pp=353-356;361}} During the filming of the latter she had had to spend a week [[drug detoxification|detox]]ing in a hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Riese|1a2=Hitchens|1y=1988|1p=270|2a1=Solomon|2y=1988|2p=139|3a1=Spoto|3y=2001|3pp=435-445;456|4a1=Churchwell|4y=2004|4p=266|5a1=Banner|5y=2012|5pp=353-356;361}} Her third marriage, to author [[Arthur Miller]], also ended in divorce in January 1961.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=450\u2013455}}\n\nInstead of working, Monroe spent a large part of 1961 preoccupied with health problems and did not work on any new film projects. She underwent surgery for her [[endometriosis]] and a [[cholecystectomy]], and spent four weeks in hospital care \u2013 including a brief stint in a [[mental ward]] \u2013 for depression.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=453, for a new role, 466\u2013467 for operations, 456\u2013464 for psychiatric hospital stays}}{{efn|Monroe first admitted herself to the [[Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic]] in New York, at the suggestion of her psychiatrist Marianne Kris.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=456\u2013459}} Kris later stated that her choice of hospital was a mistake: Monroe was placed on a ward meant for severely mentally ill people with [[psychosis]], where she was locked in a [[padded cell]] and was not allowed to move to a more suitable ward or to leave the hospital.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=456\u2013459}} Monroe was finally able to leave the hospital after three days with the help of her ex-husband [[Joe DiMaggio]], and moved to the [[Columbia University Medical Center]], spending a further 23 days there.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=456\u2013459}}}} Later in 1961, she moved back to Los Angeles after six years in Manhattan; she purchased a Spanish [[hacienda]]-style house at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=465\u2013470, 484\u2013485}} In early 1962, she received a \"World Film Favorite\" [[Golden Globe award]] and began to shoot a new film for 20th Century Fox, ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'', a remake of ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940).{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=495\u2013496|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=74\u201375}}\n\nDays before filming began, Monroe caught [[sinusitis]]; Fox was advised to postpone the production, but the advice was not heeded and filming began on schedule in late April.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=524\u2013525|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=391\u2013392|3a1=Rollyson|3y=2014|3pp=264\u2013272}} Monroe was too ill to work for the majority of the next six weeks, but despite confirmations by multiple doctors, the studio tried to pressure her by publicly alleging that she was faking it.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=524\u2013525|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=391\u2013392|3a1=Rollyson|3y=2014|3pp=264\u2013272}} On May 19, she took a break from filming to sing \"[[Happy Birthday, Mr. President|Happy Birthday]]\" on stage at President [[John F.

She experienced severe fears and frequent depressions. Mood changes were abrupt and unpredictable. Among symptoms of disorganization, sleep disturbance was prominent, for which she had been taking sedative drugs for many years. She was thus familiar with and experienced in the use of sedative drugs and well aware of their dangers. [...] In our investigation we have learned that Miss Monroe had often expressed wishes to give up, to withdraw, and even to die. On more than one occasion in the past, she had made a suicide attempt, using sedative drugs. On these occasions, she had called for help and had been rescued.\nIt is our opinion that the same pattern was repeated on the evening of Aug. 4 except for the rescue. It has been our practice with similar information collected in other cases in the past to recommend a certification for such deaths as probable suicide. Additional clews<!--written this way in the source, do not change into \"clues\"--> for suicide provided by the physical evidence are the high level of barbiturates and chloral hydrate in the blood which, with other evidence from the autopsy, indicates the probable ingestion of a large amount of drugs within a short period of time: the completely empty bottle of Nembutal, the prescription for which (25 capsules) was filled the day before the ingestion, and the locked door to the bedroom, which was unusual.<ref name=tribunecoroner/></blockquote>\n\nIn the 1970s, claims surfaced that Monroe's death was a murder and not suicide.

The human response depends on the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely eradicate the pest. Pest control measures may be performed as part of an [[integrated pest management]] strategy.\n\nIn agriculture, pests are kept at bay by [[tillage|cultural]], [[pesticide|chemical]] and [[biological pest control|biological]] means. Ploughing and cultivation of the soil before sowing  reduces the pest burden and there is a modern trend to limit the use of pesticides as far as possible. This can be achieved by monitoring the crop, only applying [[insecticide]]s when necessary, and by growing varieties and crops which are resistant to pests. Where possible, biological means are used, encouraging the [[Natural selection#Competition|natural enemies]] of the pests and introducing suitable [[Predation|predators]] or [[Parasitism|parasites]].\n\nIn homes and urban environments, the pests are the rodents, birds, insects and other organisms that share the habitat with humans, and that feed on and spoil possessions. Control of these pests is attempted through exclusion, repulsion, physical removal or chemical means. Alternatively, various methods of biological control can be used including sterilisation programmes.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bronze Saite era art of an Egyptian cat in the Gulbenkian Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze cat, Ancient Egypt.

In the 1880s, [[ladybird]]s were used in citrus plantations in California to control [[scale insect]]s, and other biological control experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to biological control experiments. By the 1960s, problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to the environment began to emerge, and biological control had a renaissance.

However, successful control by pesticides is not easy; the right formulation must be chosen, the timing is often critical, the method of application is important, adequate coverage and retention on the crop are necessary. The killing of natural enemies of the target pest should be minimised. This is particularly important in countries where there are natural reservoirs of pests and their enemies in the countryside surrounding plantation crops, and these co-exist in a delicate balance. Often in less-developed countries, the crops are well adapted to the local situation and no pesticides are needed.

The human response depends on the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely eradicate the pest. Pest control measures may be performed as part of an [[integrated pest management]] strategy.\n\nIn agriculture, pests are kept at bay by [[tillage|cultural]], [[pesticide|chemical]] and [[biological pest control|biological]] means. Ploughing and cultivation of the soil before sowing  reduces the pest burden and there is a modern trend to limit the use of pesticides as far as possible. This can be achieved by monitoring the crop, only applying [[insecticide]]s when necessary, and by growing varieties and crops which are resistant to pests. Where possible, biological means are used, encouraging the [[Natural selection#Competition|natural enemies]] of the pests and introducing suitable [[Predation|predators]] or [[Parasitism|parasites]].\n\nIn homes and urban environments, the pests are the rodents, birds, insects and other organisms that share the habitat with humans, and that feed on and spoil possessions. Control of these pests is attempted through exclusion, repulsion, physical removal or chemical means. Alternatively, various methods of biological control can be used including sterilisation programmes.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bronze Saite era art of an Egyptian cat in the Gulbenkian Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze cat, Ancient Egypt.

The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to biological control experiments.

The most important taxes are collected on federal level, these taxes include an [[income tax]], [[social security]], [[corporate taxes]] and [[value added tax]]. At the local level, [[property taxes]] as well as various fees are collected. Tax revenue stood at 48% GDP in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Tax_revenue_statistics|title = EU - Tax Revenue Statistics |date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThe amount of taxes a person in Belgium has to pay depends on whether you are or you are not a resident of the country. For a resident (a person whose work or family home is in Belgium) it is clear. But in the case of non-resident, there are two scenarios. If you are non-resident who lives in Belgium for at least six months of the year (183 days) and you are registered with your local commune, you are classified as resident. It means you are taxed by Belgium income tax on your worldwide income. But if you are a non-resident who lives in Belgium for fewer than 6 months (183 days) during the year, you have to pay Belgium income tax only on income you earned in Belgium (including rents and capital gains). <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.expatica.com/be/finance/taxes/belgian-tax-guide-understanding-taxes-in-belgium-for-foreigners-100073/|title=Belgian tax guide: Understanding taxes in Belgium for foreigners|website=Expat Guide to Belgium {{!}} Expatica|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref>\n\nThe effective taxation rate in Belgium is commonly cited as among the highest in the world; see [[list of countries by tax rates]].\n\nThe Belgian tax year for personal income runs from 1 January to 31 December.<ref name=\":1\" /> Both, residents of Belgium as well as non-residents who pay tax on their income (as mentioned above), have to file an annual Belgian tax return. A tax return associated with your income in previous year is generally delivered in May or June. Typically, it has to be returned by the end of June (exact date can be found on the particular tax return). In case you don't submit your return by the deadline, you will receive a fine. Moreover, tax authorities can determine the amount of tax you have to pay.\n\nAs regards regular income tax payments, it is quite simple. If you are employed, your employer will regularly (every month) deduct your income tax payment from your salary. With self-employed workers or paid company directors, the process is similar \u2013 tax is paid in advance on monthly basis through collecting agency or bank. In Belgium, it is also possible to pay taxes via post or online (using Belgian government's tax portal). For non-residents with Belgian-earned income, it is a bit more complicated. A tax return is delivered as soon as they inform competent tax collectors office. On the other hand, they can also pay with the use of post or online.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIncome tax is calculated by applying a progressive tax rate schedule to taxable income, with rates that go from 25% to  a maximum rate 50%.

The most important taxes are collected on federal level, these taxes include an [[income tax]], [[social security]], [[corporate taxes]] and [[value added tax]].

For a resident (a person whose work or family home is in Belgium) it is clear. But in the case of non-resident, there are two scenarios. If you are non-resident who lives in Belgium for at least six months of the year (183 days) and you are registered with your local commune, you are classified as resident. It means you are taxed by Belgium income tax on your worldwide income. But if you are a non-resident who lives in Belgium for fewer than 6 months (183 days) during the year, you have to pay Belgium income tax only on income you earned in Belgium (including rents and capital gains). <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.expatica.com/be/finance/taxes/belgian-tax-guide-understanding-taxes-in-belgium-for-foreigners-100073/|title=Belgian tax guide: Understanding taxes in Belgium for foreigners|website=Expat Guide to Belgium {{!}} Expatica|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref>\n\nThe effective taxation rate in Belgium is commonly cited as among the highest in the world; see [[list of countries by tax rates]].\n\nThe Belgian tax year for personal income runs from 1 January to 31 December.<ref name=\":1\" /> Both, residents of Belgium as well as non-residents who pay tax on their income (as mentioned above), have to file an annual Belgian tax return. A tax return associated with your income in previous year is generally delivered in May or June. Typically, it has to be returned by the end of June (exact date can be found on the particular tax return). In case you don\u00b4t submit your return by the deadline, you will receive a fine. Moreover, tax authorities can determine the amount of tax you have to pay.\n\nAs regards regular income tax payments, it is quite simple. If you are employed, your employer will regularly (every month) deduct your income tax payment from your salary. With self-employed workers or paid company directors, the process is similar \u2013 tax is paid in advance on monthly basis through collecting agency or bank. In Belgium, it is also possible to pay taxes via post or online (using Belgian government\u2019s tax portal). For non-residents with Belgian-earned income, it is a bit more complicated. A tax return is delivered as soon as they inform competent tax collectors office. On the other hand, they can also pay with the use of post or online.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIncome tax is calculated by applying a progressive tax rate schedule to taxable income, with rates that go from 25% to  a maximum rate 50%.
