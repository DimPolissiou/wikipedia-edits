Located in the [[Gastineau Channel]] and the [[Southeast Alaska|Alaskan panhandle]], it is a unified [[municipality]] and the second [[List of United States cities by area|largest city in the United States by area]]. Juneau was named the capital of Alaska in 1906, when the government of what was then the [[District of Alaska]] was moved from [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] as dictated by the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1900.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/throughyukonand02rickgoog|title=Through the Yukon and Alaska|last=Rickard|first=Thomas Arthur|date=1909|page=[https://archive.org/details/throughyukonand02rickgoog/page/n48 22]|publisher=Mining and Scientific Press|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUgFAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA251|title=Federal Statutes Annotated: Containing All the Laws of the United States of a General, Permanent and Public Nature in Force on the First Day of January, 1916|last=States|first=United|date=1916|page=251|publisher=Edward Thompson Company|language=en}}</ref> The municipality unified on July 1, 1970, when the city of Juneau merged with the city of [[Douglas, Alaska|Douglas]] and the surrounding Greater Juneau [[Borough (United States)|Borough]] to form the current municipality,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juneau.org/history-old/histoutl.php|title=An Outline History of Juneau Municipal Government|last=Miller|first=Marian|date=9 June 1997|publisher=City and Borough of Juneau|accessdate=3 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001213638/http://www.juneau.org/history-old/histoutl.php|archive-date=October 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> which is larger by area than both [[Rhode Island]] and [[Delaware]].\n\nDowntown Juneau ({{coord|58|18|07|N|134|25|11|W|scale:10000}}) is nestled at the base of [[Mount Juneau]] and across the channel from [[Douglas Island]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the City and Borough had a population of 31,276. In 2018, the population estimate from the United States Census Bureau was 32,113, making it the second most populous city in [[Alaska]] after [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>  Juneau experiences a daily influx of roughly 6,000 people from visiting cruise ships between the months of May and September.\n\nThe city is named after a gold prospector from [[Quebec]], [[Joe Juneau (prospector)|Joe Juneau]], though the place was for a time called ''Rockwell'' and then ''Harrisburg'' (after Juneau's co-prospector, [[Richard Harris (prospector)|Richard Harris]]). The Tlingit name of the town is {{lang|tli|Dz\u00e1ntik'i H\u00e9eni}} (\"Base of the Flounder's River,\" {{lang|tli|dz\u00e1nti}} 'flounder,' {{lang|tli|\u2013k\u02bci}} 'base,' {{lang|tli|h\u00e9en}} 'river'), and [[Auke Bay]] just north of Juneau proper is called {{lang|tli|\u00c1ak'w}} (\"Little lake,\" {{lang|tli|\u00e1a}} 'lake,' {{lang|tli|-k\u02bc}} 'diminutive') in Tlingit. The [[Taku River]], just south of Juneau, was named after the cold {{lang|tli|t'aakh}} wind, which occasionally blows down from the mountains.\n\nJuneau is unique among U.S. capitals in that there are no roads connecting the city to the rest of the state. Honolulu, Hawaii, is the only other state capital not connected by road to the rest of North America. The absence of a road network is due to the extremely rugged terrain surrounding the city. This in turn makes Juneau a ''de facto'' island city in terms of transportation, since all goods coming in and out must go by plane or boat, in spite of the city's being on the Alaskan mainland. Downtown Juneau sits at sea level, with tides averaging {{convert|16|ft|m|0}}, below steep mountains about {{convert|3500|ft|m|-2}} to {{convert|4000|ft|m|-2}} high. Atop these mountains is the [[Juneau Icefield]], a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow; two of these, the [[Mendenhall Glacier]] and the Lemon Creek Glacier, are visible from the local road system. The Mendenhall glacier has been gradually retreating; its front face is declining in width and height.\n\nThe [[Alaska State Capitol]] in downtown Juneau was built as the Federal and Territorial Building in 1931. Prior to statehood, it housed federal government offices, the federal courthouse and a post office. It also housed the territorial legislature and many other territorial offices, including that of the governor. Today, Juneau remains the home of the [[Alaska Legislature|state legislature]] and the offices of the [[List of Governors of Alaska|governor]] and [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alaska|lieutenant governor]]. Some other executive branch offices have moved elsewhere in the state. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Taku.jpg|thumb|right|Chief Anotklosh of the Taku tribe, circa 1913]]\n\nLong before European settlement in the Americas, the [[Gastineau Channel]] was a favorite fishing ground for  the [[Auke Indians|Auke]] (''A'akw Kw\u00e1an'') and [[Taku Indians|Taku]] tribes, who had inhabited the surrounding area for thousands of years. The ''A'akw Kw\u00e1an'' had a village and burying ground here. In the 21st century it is known as Indian Point. They annually harvested herring during the spawning season, and celebrated this bounty.\n\nSince the late 20th century, the A'akw Kw\u00e1an, together with the [[Sealaska Heritage Institute]], have resisted European-American development of Indian Point, including proposals by the [[National Park Service]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). They consider it sacred territory, both because of the burying ground and the importance of the point in their traditions of gathering sustenance from the sea. They continue to gather clams, gumboots, grass and sea urchins here, as well as tree bark for medicinal uses.<ref name=\"nrhp\"/> The city and state supported [[Sealaska Heritage Institute]] in documenting the 78-acre site, and in August 2016 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. \"It is the first traditional cultural property in Southeast Alaska to be placed on the register.\"<ref name=\"nrhp\">[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/18/indian-point-goes-national-register-historic-places-165498 ICTMN Staff, \"Indian Point Goes on National Register of Historic Places\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821000125/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/18/indian-point-goes-national-register-historic-places-165498 |date=August 21, 2016 }}, ''Indian Country Today,'' 18 August 2016; accessed 21 August 2016</ref><ref name=\"phu\">[http://juneauempire.com/local/2016-08-16/feds-designate-juneaus-indian-point-sacred-worthy-protection Lisa Phu, \"Feds designate Juneau's Indian Point as sacred, worthy of protection\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820155548/http://juneauempire.com/local/2016-08-16/feds-designate-juneaus-indian-point-sacred-worthy-protection |date=August 20, 2016 }}, ''Juneau Empire,'' 16 August 2016; accessed 21 August 2016</ref>\n\nDescendants of these indigenous cultures include the [[Tlingit people]]. Native cultures have rich artistic traditions expressed in carving, weaving, orating, singing, and dancing. Juneau has become a major social center for the Tlingit, [[Haida people|Haida]], and [[Tsimshian]] of Southeast Alaska.\n\n===European encounters===\nAlthough the Russians had a colony in the Alaska territory from 1784 to 1867, they did not settle in Juneau. They conducted extensive fur trading with Alaskan Natives of the Aleutian Islands and Kodiak.\n\nThe first European to see the Juneau area was [[Joseph Whidbey]], master of the ''[[HMS Discovery (1789)|Discovery]]'' during [[George Vancouver]]'s [[Vancouver Expedition|1791\u201395 expedition]]. He and his party explored the region in July\u2013August 1794. Early in August he viewed the length of Gastineau Channel from the south, noting a small island in mid-channel. He later recorded seeing the channel again, this time from the west. He said it was unnavigable, being filled with ice.<ref name=\"Vancouver\">{{cite book| last1 = Vancouver| first1 = George| last2= Vancouver| first2= John| title = A voyage of discovery to the North Pacific ocean, and round the world| publisher = J.

In 1880, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] mining engineer [[George Pilz]] offered a reward to any local Native in Alaska who could lead him to gold-bearing ore. A local Native arrived with some ore, and several prospectors were sent to investigate. On their first trip to Gold Creek, they found deposits of little interest. However,Pilz sent [[Joe Juneau (prospector)|Joe Juneau]] and [[Richard Harris (prospector)|Richard Harris]] back to the Gastineau Channel, directing them to Snow Slide Gulch (the head of Gold Creek). According to the Rev. Samuel Young, in his book Alaska Days with John Muir, it was their party's campsite at the creek head that Juneau and Harris decided to explore, in the summer of 1879. There they found nuggets \"as large as peas and beans,\" in Harris' words.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Juneau City, 1887.jpg|thumb|Juneau City in 1887]]\nOn October 18, 1880, the two men marked a {{convert|160|acre|m2|adj=on}} town site where soon a mining camp sprang up. Within a year, so many miners had arrived that the camp became a village, albeit made up mostly of tents and shacks rather than substantial buildings. It was the first [[European American]] settlement founded in this territory after the United States [[Alaska Purchase|purchased Alaska]].\n\nBy the autumn of 1881, the village had a population of over 100 and was known as Rockwell, after Lt. Com. Charles Rockwell; later it was known as Harrisburg after prospector Richard Harris.  On December 14, 1881, a miners' meeting of 72 persons decided to name the settlement Juneau, after [[prospecting|prospector]] Joe Juneau.<ref name=Spencer>{{Cite book |author=Arthur C.

It had given services in northern Tlingit settlements in local languages since 1800 and 1824. One of its priests had translated scripture and liturgy into the [[Tlingit language]] in the 1830s\u20131840s. The Tlingit arranged for an Orthodox priest to come to their settlement in Juneau. In 1890, some 700 people converted, following chief Yees Gaanaalx and his wife of Auke Bay. The Orthodox Church Missionary Society supported the Tlingit in furnishing and constructing a church for this large congregation.<ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\nSt. Nicholas Orthodox Church was completed in 1894 and has maintained a strong presence among the Tlingit, Serbians, and other Europeans who followed this church. The iconostasis has six large panels sent from Russia.<ref name=nrhpdoc>{{cite web |url={{NRHP url|id=73000377}} |title=St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church |author=Amos Wallace |date=April 10, 1973 |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NRHP url|id=73000377|title=accompanying photos from 1961 and 1972|photos=y}}</ref>\n\n===Development of mining===\nDuring this period, prospector and [[placer mine]]r [[John Lemon (prospector)|John Lemon]] operated in what is today the [[Lemon Creek, Alaska|Lemon Creek]] area. The neighborhood that developed there was named for him by early settlers, as have been several other landmarks in Juneau.\n\nMajor mining operations in the [[Juneau mining district]] prior to World War II included the [[Treadwell gold mine|Treadwell Mine]], [[Alaska-Juneau Gold Mining Company|The Alaska-Juneau Mine]], and [[Alaska-Gastineau Mine]].\n\nBy 1906, after the decline of whaling and the fur trade, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], the original capital of Alaska, had become less important and the territorial legislature moved the seat of government to Juneau in accordance with a 1900 federal law.<ref name=\":0\" /> Juneau was the largest city in Alaska during the inter-war years, passing [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] in the [[1920 United States Census|1920 census]]. In the post-World War II years, it was displaced by [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] in [[1950 United States Census|1950]].\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nIn 1911, the United States Congress authorized funds for construction of a capitol building for the Alaska Territory. [[World War I]] delayed construction and there were difficulties purchasing the necessary land. Citizens of Juneau donated some of the required funds, and construction began on September 8, 1929. Construction of the capitol took less than two years, and the building was dedicated as the Federal and Territorial Building on February 14, 1931. It was designed by Treasury Department architects in the [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco architectural style]]. The building was originally used by the federal government to house the federal courthouse and post office for the territory. Since Alaska gained statehood in 1959, the building has been used by the state government.\n\nThe Alaska Governor's Mansion was commissioned under the Public Building Act in 1910. The mansion was designed by [[James Knox Taylor]] in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. Construction was completed in 1912. The territorial governor at that time was the first governor to inhabit the mansion, and he held the first open house for citizens on January 1, 1913. The area of the mansion is {{convert|14400|sqft|m2}}. It has ten bathrooms, six bedrooms, and eight fireplaces. The governor resides here when in Juneau on official business. In June 1923, President [[Warren G. Harding]] became the first president to visit Alaska.

Some supporters of a move wanted a new capital to be at least {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Anchorage and Fairbanks, to prevent either city from having undue influence. Juneau has continued as the capital. In the 1970s, voters passed a plan to move the capital to [[Willow, Alaska|Willow]], a town {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of Anchorage. But pro-Juneau people there and in Fairbanks persuaded voters also to approve a measure (the FRANK Initiative) requiring voter approval of all bondable construction costs before building could begin.

This includes the state government, federal government (which has regional offices here, especially for resource agencies), municipal government (which includes the local airport, hospital, harbors, and school district), and the [[University of Alaska Southeast]]. State government offices and their indirect economic impact compose approximately one-quarter of Juneau's economy.<ref>The Associated Press.

In 2005, the [[cruise ship]] industry was estimated to bring nearly one million visitors to Juneau for up to 11 hours at a time, between May and September.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cruise outlook for 2005 shows growth|url=http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/041005/loc_20050410003.shtml|accessdate=November 15, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050416002456/http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/041005/loc_20050410003.shtml|archive-date=April 16, 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>  While cruise ships provide an economic boost to segments of the economy, not all locals are appreciative.  The Juneau Public Library, built atop a parking garage along South Franklin Street near the [[Red Dog Saloon]], was designed to take advantage of the view of and across Gastineau Channel.  This view is often blocked by docking cruise ships, which have become so large that they tower over the five-story structure.  [[Bill Ray (politician)|Bill Ray]], who lived in Juneau from 1938 to 2000 and represented the community in the [[Alaska Legislature]] from 1965 to 1987, said when he paid a return visit in 2003: \"Juneau doesn't go forward.

Juneau was recently the 49th most lucrative U.S. fisheries port by volume and 45th by value. In 2004 it took in 15 million pounds of fish and shellfish, valued at 21.5 million dollars, according to the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]]. While the port of Juneau does comparatively little seafood processing compared to other towns of this size in Alaska, the hundreds of commercial fishing boats sell their fish to plants in nearby Sitka, Hoonah, Petersburg and Ketchikan.  The largest fleets operating from Juneau are the gillnet and troll salmon fleets.\n\nJuneau is also the home to many of the commercial fishing associations in Alaska, as they want to educate and lobby the state legislature. These associations include the Alaska Trollers Association, United Fishermen of Alaska, United Southeast Alaska Gillnetters Association, and the Southeast Alaska Seiners Association.\n\nReal estate agencies, federally funded highway construction, and mining are still viable non-government local industries.

The Juneau Symphony performs regularly. The Juneau Lyric Opera and Opera to Go are the two local opera companies. The JUMP Society hosts screenings of locally made short films two times a year.\n\nDowntown Juneau has many art galleries that participate in the monthly First Friday Art Walk and annual Gallery Walk held in the first week of December. The Juneau Arts & Humanities Council coordinates events and operates the Juneau Arts & Culture Center, which features a community center, gallery and lobby shop. The [[University of Alaska Southeast]] Campus offers lectures, concerts, and theater performances.

The mayor is the titular head of the city, is the presiding officer (or chair) of the [[Assembly of the City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska|Juneau Assembly]] (council), and is one of three members of that body elected [[at-large]], or areawide.  The remaining six members are elected by [[single-member district]]s: two districts have been defined by the Assembly, as of its last redistricting in 2003:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juneau.org/clerk/elections/documents/Ord_2003-15_amended_assembly_districts_2012_000.pdf|title=CBJ Assembly Districts|date=June 30, 2012|work=juneau.org|publisher=Office of the City and Borough of Juneau Clerk|accessdate=April 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831055407/http://www.juneau.org/clerk/elections/documents/Ord_2003-15_amended_assembly_districts_2012_000.pdf|archive-date=August 31, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{| style=\"width:60%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:30%;\"|\n* District 1 precincts\n** [[Douglas, Alaska|Douglas]]\n** Juneau No. 1\n** Juneau No. 2\n** Juneau No. 3\n** [[Juneau International Airport|Juneau Airport]]\n** [[Lemon Creek, Alaska|Lemon Creek]]\n** [[Douglas Island|North Douglas]]\n| style=\"width:30%;\"|\n* District 2 precincts\n** [[Auke Bay, Alaska|Auke Bay]]\n** [[Out the road|Lynn Canal]]\n** [[Mendenhall Valley]] No. 1\n** Mendenhall Valley No. 2\n** Mendenhall Valley No. 3\n** Mendenhall Valley No. 4\n|} They hire a professional city manager to handle daily affairs.\n\nThese districts are nearly aligned with the boundaries of the 31st and 32nd election districts that were established by the state.  The main difference is that the 32nd District includes communities outside the CBJ: [[Gustavus, Alaska|Gustavus]], [[Kupreanof, Alaska|Kupreanof]], [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]], [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] and [[Tenakee Springs, Alaska|Tenakee Springs]].  The Juneau Airport precinct is in the 31st district, which is otherwise identical to the 2nd Assembly District.\n\nSince Juneau was split into two state house districts by the state during [[redistricting]] in the early 1990s, the districts comprising downtown Juneau, Douglas Island and surrounding areas have exclusively elected [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to the [[Alaska House of Representatives]], while the districts comprising Mendenhall Valley and surrounding areas have mostly elected [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].  The 31st District is currently represented in the House by Democrat [[Andi Story]], who has been in office since 2018.  The 32nd District is represented by Democrat [[Sara Hannan]].\n\nCombined, these two election districts form [[Alaska Senate]] District Q. That seat is held by Democrat [[Dennis Egan]], a former Juneau mayor who has been in office since 2009. The last Republican to represent Juneau in the state Senate was Elton Engstrom, Jr., the father of Cathy Mu\u00f1oz. He left office at the end of his term in early 1971, after failing to be re-elected in 1970.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:left; margin:15px\"\n|+ '''Presidential Election Results for the City and Borough of Juneau 2004\u20132008'''<ref>\"2008 Presidential Election Results by House District in Alaska\".

A number of executive branch departments, as well as the legislature, are based in Juneau.  The legislature, in response to repeated pressure from [[Southcentral Alaska]] to move either the capital or the legislature, acquired and renovated several buildings in the vicinity of the [[Alaska State Capitol]], which hold committee meeting rooms and administrative offices for the [[Alaska Legislative Council|Legislative Affairs Agency]].  These buildings were named for former legislators [[Terry Miller (politician)|Terry Miller]] and Thomas B. Stewart.  Stewart, a Juneau native and son of early Juneau mayor Benjamin D. Stewart, represented Juneau in the Senate during the [[1st Alaska State Legislature]]. He later served in Juneau's [[Alaska Superior Court]] judgeship and was noted as an authority on the latter territory/early statehood eras of [[History of Alaska|Alaska's history]].\n\nThe federal government has a nine-story federal building in Juneau in the area known as \"The Flats\". Along [[Gold Creek (Juneau, Alaska)|Gold Creek]] near its mouth and a short distance east of the [[Juneau-Douglas Bridge]], the building houses numerous federal agencies, the [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska]], and Juneau's main [[United States Postal Service|post office]]. It was designed by [[Linn A. Forrest]] and constructed in 1966. Under the [[Alaska Statehood Act]], the Federal and Territorial Building was transferred to the new state for use as its [[Alaska State Capitol|capitol]].\n\n==Education==\n===Primary and secondary schools===\nJuneau is served by the [[Juneau School District]] and includes the following schools:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jsd.k12.ak.us/newdistrict/schools/ |title=Schools in the Juneau School District |access-date=December 2, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111190635/http://www.jsd.k12.ak.us/newdistrict/schools/ |archive-date=November 11, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{| style=\"width:70%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n*Gastineau Elementary School\n*Harborview Elementary School\n*Riverbend Elementary School\n*Mendenhall River Elementary School\n*Glacier Valley Elementary School\n*Auke Bay Elementary School\n*Juneau Community Charter School\n*Montessori Borealis School\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n*Dzantik'i Heeni Middle School\n*[[Floyd Dryden Middle School]]\n*[[Juneau-Douglas High School]]\n*[[Thunder Mountain High School]]\n*[[Yaa\u1e35oosg\u00e9 Daakah\u00eddi Alternative High School]]\n*HomeBRIDGE ([[homeschooling]] program)\n|}\n\nIn addition, the following private schools also serve Juneau:\n* (Glacier) Valley Baptist Academy\n* Faith Community School\n* Thunder Mountain Learning Center (Formerly Thunder Mountain Academy)\n* Juneau Seventh-day Adventist Christian School\n* Juneau Montessori School\n\n===Colleges and universities===\nThe [[University of Alaska Southeast]] is within the [[Auke Bay]] community along the shore of [[Auke Lake]].

The university was restructured as the University of Alaska Southeast to include Ketchikan and Sitka campuses. The university offers undergraduate and graduate studies.\n\n==Transportation==\nJuneau is not directly accessible by road, although there are road connections to several areas immediately adjacent to the city. Primary access to the city is by air and sea.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the City and Borough had a population of 31,276. In 2018, the population estimate from the United States Census Bureau was 32,113, making it the second most populous city in [[Alaska]] after [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>  Juneau experiences a daily influx of roughly 6,000 people from visiting cruise ships between the months of May and September.\n\nThe city is named after a gold prospector from [[Quebec]], [[Joe Juneau (prospector)|Joe Juneau]], though the place was for a time called ''Rockwell'' and then ''Harrisburg'' (after Juneau's co-prospector, [[Richard Harris (prospector)|Richard Harris]]). The Tlingit name of the town is {{lang|tli|Dz\u00e1ntik'i H\u00e9eni}} (\"Base of the Flounder's River,\" {{lang|tli|dz\u00e1nti}} 'flounder,' {{lang|tli|\u2013k\u02bci}} 'base,' {{lang|tli|h\u00e9en}} 'river'), and [[Auke Bay]] just north of Juneau proper is called {{lang|tli|\u00c1ak'w}} (\"Little lake,\" {{lang|tli|\u00e1a}} 'lake,' {{lang|tli|-k\u02bc}} 'diminutive') in Tlingit. The [[Taku River]], just south of Juneau, was named after the cold {{lang|tli|t'aakh}} wind, which occasionally blows down from the mountains.\n\nJuneau is unique among U.S. capitals in that there are no roads connecting the city to the rest of the state. Honolulu, Hawaii, is the only other state capital not connected by road to the rest of North America. The absence of a road network is due to the extremely rugged terrain surrounding the city. This in turn makes Juneau a ''de facto'' island city in terms of transportation, since all goods coming in and out must go by plane or boat, in spite of the city's being on the Alaskan mainland. Downtown Juneau sits at sea level, with tides averaging {{convert|16|ft|m|0}}, below steep mountains about {{convert|3500|ft|m|-2}} to {{convert|4000|ft|m|-2}} high. Atop these mountains is the [[Juneau Icefield]], a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow; two of these, the [[Mendenhall Glacier]] and the Lemon Creek Glacier, are visible from the local road system. The Mendenhall glacier has been gradually retreating; its front face is declining in width and height.\n\nThe [[Alaska State Capitol]] in downtown Juneau was built as the Federal and Territorial Building in 1931. Prior to statehood, it housed federal government offices, the federal courthouse and a post office. It also housed the territorial legislature and many other territorial offices, including that of the governor. Today, Juneau remains the home of the [[Alaska Legislature|state legislature]] and the offices of the [[List of Governors of Alaska|governor]] and [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alaska|lieutenant governor]]. Some other executive branch offices have moved elsewhere in the state. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Taku.jpg|thumb|right|Chief Anotklosh of the Taku tribe, circa 1913]]\n\nLong before European settlement in the Americas, the [[Gastineau Channel]] was a favorite fishing ground for  the [[Auke Indians|Auke]] (''A'akw Kw\u00e1an'') and [[Taku Indians|Taku]] tribes, who had inhabited the surrounding area for thousands of years. The ''A'akw Kw\u00e1an'' had a village and burying ground here. In the 21st century it is known as Indian Point. They annually harvested herring during the spawning season, and celebrated this bounty.\n\nSince the late 20th century, the A'akw Kw\u00e1an, together with the [[Sealaska Heritage Institute]], have resisted European-American development of Indian Point, including proposals by the [[National Park Service]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). They consider it sacred territory, both because of the burying ground and the importance of the point in their traditions of gathering sustenance from the sea. They continue to gather clams, gumboots, grass and sea urchins here, as well as tree bark for medicinal uses.<ref name=\"nrhp\"/> The city and state supported [[Sealaska Heritage Institute]] in documenting the 78-acre site, and in August 2016 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. \"It is the first traditional cultural property in Southeast Alaska to be placed on the register.\"<ref name=\"nrhp\">[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/18/indian-point-goes-national-register-historic-places-165498 ICTMN Staff, \"Indian Point Goes on National Register of Historic Places\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821000125/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/18/indian-point-goes-national-register-historic-places-165498 |date=August 21, 2016 }}, ''Indian Country Today,'' 18 August 2016; accessed 21 August 2016</ref><ref name=\"phu\">[http://juneauempire.com/local/2016-08-16/feds-designate-juneaus-indian-point-sacred-worthy-protection Lisa Phu, \"Feds designate Juneau's Indian Point as sacred, worthy of protection\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820155548/http://juneauempire.com/local/2016-08-16/feds-designate-juneaus-indian-point-sacred-worthy-protection |date=August 20, 2016 }}, ''Juneau Empire,'' 16 August 2016; accessed 21 August 2016</ref>\n\nDescendants of these indigenous cultures include the [[Tlingit people]]. Native cultures have rich artistic traditions expressed in carving, weaving, orating, singing, and dancing. Juneau has become a major social center for the Tlingit, [[Haida people|Haida]], and [[Tsimshian]] of Southeast Alaska.\n\n===European encounters===\nAlthough the Russians had a colony in the Alaska territory from 1784 to 1867, they did not settle in Juneau. They conducted extensive fur trading with Alaskan Natives of the Aleutian Islands and Kodiak.\n\nThe first European to see the Juneau area was [[Joseph Whidbey]], master of the ''[[HMS Discovery (1789)|Discovery]]'' during [[George Vancouver]]'s [[Vancouver Expedition|1791\u201395 expedition]]. He and his party explored the region in July\u2013August 1794. Early in August he viewed the length of Gastineau Channel from the south, noting a small island in mid-channel.

In 1880, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] mining engineer [[George Pilz]] offered a reward to any local Native in Alaska who could lead him to gold-bearing ore. A local Native arrived with some ore, and several prospectors were sent to investigate. On their first trip to Gold Creek, they found deposits of little interest. However,Pilz sent [[Joe Juneau (prospector)|Joe Juneau]] and [[Richard Harris (prospector)|Richard Harris]] back to the Gastineau Channel, directing them to Snow Slide Gulch (the head of Gold Creek). According to the Rev. Samuel Young, in his book Alaska Days with John Muir, it was their party's campsite at the creek head that Juneau and Harris decided to explore, in the summer of 1879. There they found nuggets \"as large as peas and beans,\" in Harris' words.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Juneau City, 1887.jpg|thumb|Juneau City in 1887]]\nOn October 18, 1880, the two men marked a {{convert|160|acre|m2|adj=on}} town site where soon a mining camp sprang up. Within a year, so many miners had arrived that the camp became a village, albeit made up mostly of tents and shacks rather than substantial buildings. It was the first [[European American]] settlement founded in this territory after the United States [[Alaska Purchase|purchased Alaska]].\n\nBy the autumn of 1881, the village had a population of over 100 and was known as Rockwell, after Lt. Com. Charles Rockwell; later it was known as Harrisburg after prospector Richard Harris.  On December 14, 1881, a miners' meeting of 72 persons decided to name the settlement Juneau, after [[prospecting|prospector]] Joe Juneau.<ref name=Spencer>{{Cite book |author=Arthur C.

It had given services in northern Tlingit settlements in local languages since 1800 and 1824. One of its priests had translated scripture and liturgy into the [[Tlingit language]] in the 1830s\u20131840s. The Tlingit arranged for an Orthodox priest to come to their settlement in Juneau. In 1890, some 700 people converted, following chief Yees Gaanaalx and his wife of Auke Bay. The Orthodox Church Missionary Society supported the Tlingit in furnishing and constructing a church for this large congregation.<ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\nSt. Nicholas Orthodox Church was completed in 1894 and has maintained a strong presence among the Tlingit, Serbians, and other Europeans who followed this church.

The neighborhood that developed there was named for him by early settlers, as have been several other landmarks in Juneau.\n\nMajor mining operations in the [[Juneau mining district]] prior to World War II included the [[Treadwell gold mine|Treadwell Mine]], [[Alaska-Juneau Gold Mining Company|The Alaska-Juneau Mine]], and [[Alaska-Gastineau Mine]].\n\nBy 1906, after the decline of whaling and the fur trade, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], the original capital of Alaska, had become less important and the territorial legislature moved the seat of government to Juneau in accordance with a 1900 federal law.<ref name=\":0\" /> Juneau was the largest city in Alaska during the inter-war years, passing [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] in the [[1920 United States Census|1920 census]]. In the post-World War II years, it was displaced by [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] in [[1950 United States Census|1950]].\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nIn 1911, the United States Congress authorized funds for construction of a capitol building for the Alaska Territory. [[World War I]] delayed construction and there were difficulties purchasing the necessary land. Citizens of Juneau donated some of the required funds, and construction began on September 8, 1929. Construction of the capitol took less than two years, and the building was dedicated as the Federal and Territorial Building on February 14, 1931. It was designed by Treasury Department architects in the [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco architectural style]]. The building was originally used by the federal government to house the federal courthouse and post office for the territory. Since Alaska gained statehood in 1959, the building has been used by the state government.\n\nThe Alaska Governor's Mansion was commissioned under the Public Building Act in 1910. The mansion was designed by [[James Knox Taylor]] in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. Construction was completed in 1912. The territorial governor at that time was the first governor to inhabit the mansion, and he held the first open house for citizens on January 1, 1913. The area of the mansion is {{convert|14400|sqft|m2}}. It has ten bathrooms, six bedrooms, and eight fireplaces. The governor resides here when in Juneau on official business. In June 1923, President [[Warren G. Harding]] became the first president to visit Alaska. Harding visited the Governor's Mansion while Territorial Governor [[Scott Bone]], who was appointed by Harding, was in office. Harding spoke from the porch of the mansion explaining his policies and met with attendees.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], more than 50 Japanese citizens and Japanese Americans residing in Juneau were [[internment of Japanese Americans|evacuated to the internment camps inland]] as a result of [[Executive Order 9066]]\u2014which authorized the forced removal of all ethnic Japanese away from their homes and businesses on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. The removal of Juneau's Japanese community during the war was later commemorated known as the ''[[Empty Chair Memorial]]'' in July 2014 during a dedication ceremony at the neighborhood of Capital School Park in the city.<ref>{{cite web | title=Empty Chair Project recognizes Juneau's Japanese WWII internees | url=https://www.ktoo.org/2014/07/13/empty-chair-project-recognizes-juneaus-japanese-wwii-internees/ | author=Jeremy Hsieh | date=July 13, 2014 | publisher=[[KTOO (FM)|KTOO]] | accessdate=July 8, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709022307/https://www.ktoo.org/2014/07/13/empty-chair-project-recognizes-juneaus-japanese-wwii-internees/ | archive-date=July 9, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Atwood]], then publisher of the ''[[Anchorage Times]]'' and an Anchorage \"booster,\" was an early leader in efforts to move the capital to Fairbanks, which many in both cities resisted. Some supporters of a move wanted a new capital to be at least {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Anchorage and Fairbanks, to prevent either city from having undue influence. Juneau has continued as the capital. In the 1970s, voters passed a plan to move the capital to [[Willow, Alaska|Willow]], a town {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of Anchorage. But pro-Juneau people there and in Fairbanks persuaded voters also to approve a measure (the FRANK Initiative) requiring voter approval of all bondable construction costs before building could begin. Alaskans later voted against spending the estimated $900 million. A 1984 \"ultimate\" capital-move vote also failed, as did a 1996 vote.\n\n[[File:Downtown Juneau with Mount Juneau rising in the background.jpg|thumb|Downtown Juneau, with [[Mount Juneau]] in the background]]\nJuneau remains the capital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/capmove.htm |title=Sean Parnell, 10th Governor of Alaska |publisher=Gov.state.ak.us |accessdate=2011-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225223217/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/capmove.htm |archivedate=2008-02-25 }}</ref> Once Alaska was granted [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1959, Juneau's population increased along with the growth of state government.

This includes the state government, federal government (which has regional offices here, especially for resource agencies), municipal government (which includes the local airport, hospital, harbors, and school district), and the [[University of Alaska Southeast]]. State government offices and their indirect economic impact compose approximately one-quarter of Juneau's economy.<ref>The Associated Press.

In 2005, the [[cruise ship]] industry was estimated to bring nearly one million visitors to Juneau for up to 11 hours at a time, between May and September.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cruise outlook for 2005 shows growth|url=http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/041005/loc_20050410003.shtml|accessdate=November 15, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050416002456/http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/041005/loc_20050410003.shtml|archive-date=April 16, 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>  While cruise ships provide an economic boost to segments of the economy, not all locals are appreciative.  The Juneau Public Library, built atop a parking garage along South Franklin Street near the [[Red Dog Saloon]], was designed to take advantage of the view of and across Gastineau Channel.  This view is often blocked by docking cruise ships, which have become so large that they tower over the five-story structure.

Juneau was recently the 49th most lucrative U.S. fisheries port by volume and 45th by value. In 2004 it took in 15 million pounds of fish and shellfish, valued at 21.5 million dollars, according to the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]]. While the port of Juneau does comparatively little seafood processing compared to other towns of this size in Alaska, the hundreds of commercial fishing boats sell their fish to plants in nearby Sitka, Hoonah, Petersburg and Ketchikan.  The largest fleets operating from Juneau are the gillnet and troll salmon fleets.\n\nJuneau is also the home to many of the commercial fishing associations in Alaska, as they want to educate and lobby the state legislature. These associations include the Alaska Trollers Association, United Fishermen of Alaska, United Southeast Alaska Gillnetters Association, and the Southeast Alaska Seiners Association.\n\nReal estate agencies, federally funded highway construction, and mining are still viable non-government local industries.

The JUMP Society hosts screenings of locally made short films two times a year.\n\nDowntown Juneau has many art galleries that participate in the monthly First Friday Art Walk and annual Gallery Walk held in the first week of December. The Juneau Arts & Humanities Council coordinates events and operates the Juneau Arts & Culture Center, which features a community center, gallery and lobby shop. The [[University of Alaska Southeast]] Campus offers lectures, concerts, and theater performances.

The Juneau Airport precinct is in the 31st district, which is otherwise identical to the 2nd Assembly District.\n\nSince Juneau was split into two state house districts by the state during [[redistricting]] in the early 1990s, the districts comprising downtown Juneau, Douglas Island and surrounding areas have exclusively elected [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to the [[Alaska House of Representatives]], while the districts comprising Mendenhall Valley and surrounding areas have mostly elected [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].  The 31st District is currently represented in the House by Democrat [[Andi Story]], who has been in office since 2018.  The 32nd District is represented by Democrat [[Sara Hannan]].\n\nCombined, these two election districts form [[Alaska Senate]] District Q. That seat is held by Democrat [[Dennis Egan]], a former Juneau mayor who has been in office since 2009. The last Republican to represent Juneau in the state Senate was Elton Engstrom, Jr., the father of Cathy Mu\u00f1oz. He left office at the end of his term in early 1971, after failing to be re-elected in 1970.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:left; margin:15px\"\n|+ '''Presidential Election Results for the City and Borough of Juneau 2004\u20132008'''<ref>\"2008 Presidential Election Results by House District in Alaska\".

A number of executive branch departments, as well as the legislature, are based in Juneau.  The legislature, in response to repeated pressure from [[Southcentral Alaska]] to move either the capital or the legislature, acquired and renovated several buildings in the vicinity of the [[Alaska State Capitol]], which hold committee meeting rooms and administrative offices for the [[Alaska Legislative Council|Legislative Affairs Agency]].  These buildings were named for former legislators [[Terry Miller (politician)|Terry Miller]] and Thomas B. Stewart.  Stewart, a Juneau native and son of early Juneau mayor Benjamin D. Stewart, represented Juneau in the Senate during the [[1st Alaska State Legislature]]. He later served in Juneau's [[Alaska Superior Court]] judgeship and was noted as an authority on the latter territory/early statehood eras of [[History of Alaska|Alaska's history]].\n\nThe federal government has a nine-story federal building in Juneau in the area known as \"The Flats\". Along [[Gold Creek (Juneau, Alaska)|Gold Creek]] near its mouth and a short distance east of the [[Juneau-Douglas Bridge]], the building houses numerous federal agencies, the [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska]], and Juneau's main [[United States Postal Service|post office]]. It was designed by [[Linn A. Forrest]] and constructed in 1966. Under the [[Alaska Statehood Act]], the Federal and Territorial Building was transferred to the new state for use as its [[Alaska State Capitol|capitol]].\n\n==Education==\n===Primary and secondary schools===\nJuneau is served by the [[Juneau School District]] and includes the following schools:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jsd.k12.ak.us/newdistrict/schools/ |title=Schools in the Juneau School District |access-date=December 2, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111190635/http://www.jsd.k12.ak.us/newdistrict/schools/ |archive-date=November 11, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{| style=\"width:70%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n*Gastineau Elementary School\n*Harborview Elementary School\n*Riverbend Elementary School\n*Mendenhall River Elementary School\n*Glacier Valley Elementary School\n*Auke Bay Elementary School\n*Juneau Community Charter School\n*Montessori Borealis School\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n*Dzantik'i Heeni Middle School\n*[[Floyd Dryden Middle School]]\n*[[Juneau-Douglas High School]]\n*[[Thunder Mountain High School]]\n*[[Yaa\u1e35oosg\u00e9 Daakah\u00eddi Alternative High School]]\n*HomeBRIDGE ([[homeschooling]] program)\n|}\n\nIn addition, the following private schools also serve Juneau:\n* (Glacier) Valley Baptist Academy\n* Faith Community School\n* Thunder Mountain Learning Center (Formerly Thunder Mountain Academy)\n* Juneau Seventh-day Adventist Christian School\n* Juneau Montessori School\n\n===Colleges and universities===\nThe [[University of Alaska Southeast]] is within the [[Auke Bay]] community along the shore of [[Auke Lake]].

Nemo appears in two of Verne's science-fiction classics, ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870) and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1875). He also makes a cameo appearance in a play on which Verne may have collaborated, ''[[Journey Through the Impossible]]'' (1882).\n\nNemo is a mysterious figure. Though originally of unknown nationality, he's later described as the son of an East Indian [[Maharaja|raja]]. A scientific visionary, he roams the depths of the seas in his [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was assembled from parts manufactured in several different countries, then shipped to Nemo's cover address. The captain is consumed by a hunger for vengeance and hatred of [[imperialism]]; the [[British Empire]] is ultimately revealed as his main antagonist. \n\nNemo has appeared in various film adaptations of Verne's novels, where he has been portrayed by such celebrated actors as [[James Mason]], [[Herbert Lom]], and [[Michael Caine]]. He has also been appropriated by other authors for their own novels, including [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'',  [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s ''[[Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius]]'', and [[Thomas F. Monteleone]]'s ''The Secret Sea''.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n''Nemo'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for \"no one\" or \"nobody\".\n\nMoreover ''Nemo'' is itself the Latin translation of [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[Outis]]'' (\"Nobody\"), the pseudonym adopted by [[Odysseus]], in [[Greek mythology]]\u2014a ruse employed to outwit the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]]. This appears to be the intended meaning, since in ''The Mysterious Island'', when Cyrus Smith addresses him as Captain Nemo, the latter replies, \"I have no name!\"\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n[[File:OrchhaPalace.jpg|thumb|[[Jahangir Mahal, Orchha|Jahangir Mahal]], home to the real-life rajas of [[Orchha State|Orchha]], Bundelkhand]]\n[[File:Nemo s death.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo's death in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'']]\nChief among the few details of Nemo's history given in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' are his hatred of imperialism and his grief over the loss of his loved ones in years past.\n\nIn ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', Captain Nemo identifies himself as Prince Dakkar, son of the Hindu [[Maharaja|raja]] of [[Bundelkhand]], and a descendant of the Muslim [[Sultan]] [[Tipu Sultan|Fateh Ali Khan Tipu]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], famous for the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1767\u20131799) and [[Mysorean rockets|Mysorean rocket]] technology. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], in which Dakkar lost both his family and his kingdom, the prince devoted himself to scientific research, ultimately building the [[Nautilus (Verne)|''Nautilus'']] and crusing the seven seas with a crew of devoted followers. They gather [[bullion]] from various shipwrecks in the ocean, most notably from the hulks of the Spanish treasure fleet sunk during the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]]. Nemo claims to have no interest in terrestrial affairs but occasionally intervenes to aid people in distress, e.g.,  by giving salvaged treasure to participants in the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)]] against the island's [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] rulers ... by saving (both physically and financially) a [[Sinhalese people|Ceylonese]] or [[Tamil people|Tamil]] pearl hunter from a shark attack ... by rescuing the castaways in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' ... and by covertly protecting another set of castaways in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''.\n\nLike many actual [[Princely state|Indian princes]] of the era, Nemo had a Western education, during which, as he states, he spent his youth studying and touring Europe. In his first meeting with Professor Aronnax and his companions, the three castaways speak to him in French, English, [[Latin]], and German; Nemo later reveals that he is fluent in all of these tongues. Aronnax praises the captain's French, noting that he \"expressed himself with perfect ease and without any accent.\" Relying on his intuition and knowledge of [[ethnology]], the professor concludes that \"there's southern blood\" in him but can't determine the captain's exact origin. The ''Nautilus''{{'s}} library, lounge, and art collections reveal that Nemo is intimately acquainted with European culture, plus that he's an accomplished performer on the [[pipe organ|organ]].\n\nNemo dies of unspecified natural causes on board the ''Nautilus'', docked for good inside Dakkar Grotto on [[The Mysterious Island|Lincoln Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Cyrus Smith, leader of the castaways whom Nemo protected, administered the last rites, then submerged the ''Nautilus'' in the grotto's waters.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:20000 Nemo organ.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo playing the [[organ (music)|organ]], at which he was a master.]]\n\nNemo's character in the novels is largely seen through the observations of Professor Pierre Aronnax, the narrator of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', when Nemo is about forty years of age and described as a reticent man, tall and swarthy in appearance, with a straight nose and wide-set eyes. In ''The Mysterious Island'', the aged Captain Nemo sports a long white beard.\n\nHe avoids dry land, except when it's uninhabited, as with [[Antarctica]] and [[desert islands]]. In keeping with his contempt for the nations of the surface, he uses no products that are not marine in nature, be it food, clothing, furnishing, or even [[tobacco]]. Little is revealed about his political opinions except an almost maniacal hatred of oppression, with which he identifies all the [[imperialistic]] nations of the world. He therefore identifies himself with those oppressed, be they [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretans]] rising against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], [[Ceylonese]] [[pearl hunting|pearl divers]], or even [[Right whale|black whales]] attacked by [[sperm whales|cachalots (sperm whales)]]. When Professor Aronnax alleges that Nemo violates maritime and international law by sinking warships, Nemo responds that he is merely defending himself from his attackers, and that the laws of the world on the surface no longer apply to him. In one scene, Nemo exclaims:\n\n{{quotation|On its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every earthly horror. But thirty feet below sea level, their dominion ceases, their influence fades, their power vanishes! Ah, sir, live! Live in the heart of the seas! Here alone lies independence!

He shows the same compassion in his treatment of the castaways in ''The Mysterious Island'', and retains a strong attachment to his deceased wife and children. Though short-tempered, he rarely expresses his anger. He is also a man of immense courage, in the forefront of every activity, from releasing the ''Nautilus'' from the Antarctic ice to fighting squid in the Caribbean; and notable for having worked consecutive eight-hour shifts without a break, with little oxygen, to free the ''Nautilus'' from the ice. He was also identified as having discovered [[Atlantis]].\n\nAn extraordinary engineer, Nemo has designed and built the ''Nautilus'', besides inventing her electric propulsion and navigation systems. He has an exceptional mastery of underwater navigation, taking upon himself the most difficult submarine passages, such as those under the [[Suez|Isthmus of Suez]] and the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\n[[File:20000 Nautilus Salon.jpg|upright|thumb|The Grand Salon of the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'']]\n\nHe has a comprehensive knowledge of [[marine biology]], and it is his respect for Professor Aronnax's expertise in the field which led to his befriending the professor when the latter was cast upon the ''Nautilus''. Further, he is said to have read and annotated all the books he possessed in the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} vast library.\n\nHe has very fine taste in art, possessing several masterpieces of both painting and sculpture, from ancient and modern European masters, all of which are housed in the Grand Salon of the ''Nautilus'', along with his collection of [[pearl]]s, [[coral]]s and other such marine products, which he had gathered himself. In the opinion of Professor Aronnax, the collection of the Grand Salon far outstrips that of the [[Louvre]]. Despite the opulence visible all through the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', Nemo's cabin was furnished with little beside a bed and the navigational instruments integral to the ''Nautilus''. Captain Nemo is believed to be extremely affluent, in that while he never states exactly how much he is worth, he claims that 'without missing it, he could pay the national debt of France'.  At the time of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''{{'s}} publication, this was worth 4.6 billion francs, or $18.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2018.\n\nNemo tells Professor Aronnax that his intention was to have his autobiography sealed in an unsinkable casket and thrown overboard by the last survivor of the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} crew, in the hope that it would be washed up somewhere. Accordingly an unsinkable casket does wash up in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (wherein is revealed Nemo's background story), containing tools, guns, navigation instruments, an atlas, books, blank paper, and even clothing. The crate is lashed to empty barrels, and the contents sealed in a waterproof zinc envelope, showing careful preparation and packing. Throughout the same book, Nemo acts as an agent of [[Divine Providence]], as when the sailor Pencroff laments the absence of [[tobacco]], and a hunting party discover a plant that the young naturalist Harbert identifies as such. The other castaways keep the discovery secret until they can dry and cure the leaves. One evening, Pencroff is offered some coffee by his friends. When he declines, they say, \"A pipe, then?\" and produce a homemade pipe stuffed full, with a coal to light it. Pencroff exclaims, \"O, divine Providence! sacred Author of all things!&nbsp;... Nothing more is now wanting to our island\".<ref>{{cite wikisource |last=Verne |first=Jules |translator=Agnes Kinloch Kingston |title=The Mysterious Island |wslink=The Mysterious Island/Part 2/Chapter 10 |origyear=1874 |year=1875 |noicon=yes}}</ref>\n\n== Emblem ==\n\nHis emblem, as given in a description of the flag he raised when claiming [[Antarctica]], is a large golden '''''N''''' on a black field. The motto of the ''Nautilus'' was ''Mobilis in mobili'', which may be roughly translated from Latin as, \"moving amidst mobility\", \"moving within the moving element\", or \"changing in the changes\".\n\n[[File:20000 mobilis in mobili.jpg|center|thumb|The [[motto]] of the ''Nautilus'']]\n\n== Origin ==\n\nIn the initial draft of ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'', Nemo was a [[szlachcic|Polish noble]], a member of the [[szlachta]], resenting the murder of his family during the Russian repression of the [[January Uprising]]; but Verne's editor [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]] feared a book ban in the Russian market and offending a French ally, the [[Russian Empire]], and had Verne obscure Nemo's motivation in the first book.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Mike |last=Perschon |url=http://www.verniana.org/volumes/02/A4/Perschon.pdf |title=Finding Nemo: Verne's Antihero as Original Steampunk |journal=Verniana: Jules Verne Studies |volume=2 |date=February 1, 2010 |pages=181\u2013182}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Jess |last=Nevins |title=The Encyclopedia of Fantastic Victoriana |location=Austin, Texas |publisher=Monkeybrain Books |year=2005 |page=128 |isbn=978-1-93226-515-6}}</ref> In the second book of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea'', Nemo comes close to revealing his Indian ancestry, though this is not obvious except in retrospect, where he saves a [[Sri Lanka|Ceylonese]] pearl-fisher in the [[Gulf of Mannar]].\n\n=== Chronological inconsistency ===\n\n''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' was written between 1869 and 1870 and records the voyages of the ''Nautilus'' between 1866 and 1868. ''The Mysterious Island'' was written in 1874 but is set immediately after the [[American Civil War]], from 1861 to 1865. This would mean that Captain Nemo who appeared in ''The Mysterious Island'' dies ''before'' Captain Nemo who appeared in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' sets out on the undersea travels. Also, when Captain Nemo is finally seen in ''The Mysterious Island'', he mentions having met Aronnax 16 years previously.\n\nMany errors in the original French first printing (the 'grand in-8' published by [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]]) are likely the fault of the editors who, at that time, were unlikely to consult the authors of the books they edited before making a change.  According to the new, full translation put out by the [[Naval Institute Press]], nearly all errors can be attributed to the editors, with only a few being the fault of Jules Verne, who was otherwise meticulous.  The inconsistency of the dates between ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' is perhaps evidence in this argument, as it seems unlikely that Verne would make such an obvious gaffe.\n\nThe ''Nautilus'' goes down in the [[Maelstrom]] on June 2, 1868, according to ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', but may have survived. (''The Mysterious Island'' gives this date as June 22, 1867.) Captain Nemo dies on the ''Nautilus'' under Lincoln Island in ''The Mysterious Island'' on October 15, 1868. Therefore, some chronological inconsistencies still exist: Cyrus and Gideon knew of Captain Nemo years before Aronnax published his story, Nemo being trapped under Lincoln Island all during the time in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''.\n\n== Portrayals ==\nIn most subsequent media adaptations of ''20,000 Leagues'' and ''Mysterious Island'', Nemo is (in a deviation from Verne's novels) depicted as a European.

This appears to be the intended meaning, since in ''The Mysterious Island'', when Cyrus Smith addresses him as Captain Nemo, the latter replies, \"I have no name!\"\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n[[File:OrchhaPalace.jpg|thumb|[[Jahangir Mahal, Orchha|Jahangir Mahal]], home to the real-life rajas of [[Orchha State|Orchha]], Bundelkhand]]\n[[File:Nemo s death.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo's death in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'']]\nChief among the few details of Nemo's history given in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' are his hatred of imperialism and his grief over the loss of his loved ones in years past.\n\nIn ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', Captain Nemo identifies himself as Prince Dakkar, son of the Hindu [[Maharaja|raja]] of [[Bundelkhand]], and a descendant of the Muslim [[Sultan]] [[Tipu Sultan|Fateh Ali Khan Tipu]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], famous for the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1767\u20131799) and [[Mysorean rockets|Mysorean rocket]] technology. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], in which Dakkar lost both his family and his kingdom, the prince devoted himself to scientific research, ultimately building the [[Nautilus (Verne)|''Nautilus'']] and crusing the seven seas with a crew of devoted followers. They gather [[bullion]] from various shipwrecks in the ocean, most notably from the hulks of the Spanish treasure fleet sunk during the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]]. Nemo claims to have no interest in terrestrial affairs but occasionally intervenes to aid people in distress, e.g.,  by giving salvaged treasure to participants in the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)]] against the island's [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] rulers, by saving (both physically and financially) a [[Sinhalese people|Ceylonese]] or [[Tamil people|Tamil]] pearl hunter from a shark attack, by rescuing the castaways in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'', or by and covertly protecting another set of castaways in ''The Mysterious Island''.\n\nLike many actual [[Princely state|Indian princes]] of the era, Nemo had a Western education, during which, as he states, he spent his youth studying and touring Europe. In his first meeting with Professor Aronnax and his companions, the three castaways speak to him in French, English, [[Latin]], and German; Nemo later reveals that he is fluent in all of these tongues. Aronnax praises the captain's French, noting that he \"expressed himself with perfect ease and without any accent.\" Relying on his intuition and knowledge of [[ethnology]], the professor concludes that \"there's southern blood\" in him but can't determine the captain's exact origin. The ''Nautilus''{{'s}} library, lounge, and art collections reveal that Nemo is intimately acquainted with European culture, plus that he's an accomplished performer on the [[pipe organ|organ]].\n\nNemo dies of unspecified natural causes on board the ''Nautilus'', docked for good inside Dakkar Grotto on [[The Mysterious Island|Lincoln Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Cyrus Smith, leader of the castaways whom Nemo protected, administered the last rites, then submerged the ''Nautilus'' in the grotto's waters.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:20000 Nemo organ.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo playing the [[organ (music)|organ]], at which he was a master.]]\n\nNemo's character in the novels is largely seen through the observations of Professor Pierre Aronnax, the narrator of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', when Nemo is about forty years of age and described as a reticent man, tall and swarthy in appearance, with a straight nose and wide-set eyes. In ''The Mysterious Island'', the aged Captain Nemo sports a long white beard.\n\nHe avoids dry land, except when it's uninhabited, as with [[Antarctica]] and [[desert islands]]. In keeping with his contempt for the nations of the surface, he uses no products that are not marine in nature, be it food, clothing, furnishing, or even [[tobacco]]. Little is revealed about his political opinions except an almost maniacal hatred of oppression, with which he identifies all the [[imperialistic]] nations of the world. He therefore identifies himself with those oppressed, be they [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretans]] rising against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], [[Ceylonese]] [[pearl hunting|pearl divers]], or even [[Right whale|black whales]] attacked by [[sperm whales|cachalots (sperm whales)]]. When Professor Aronnax alleges that Nemo violates maritime and international law by sinking warships, Nemo responds that he is merely defending himself from his attackers, and that the laws of the world on the surface no longer apply to him. In one scene, Nemo exclaims:\n\n{{quotation|On its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every earthly horror. But thirty feet below sea level, their dominion ceases, their influence fades, their power vanishes! Ah, sir, live! Live in the heart of the seas! Here alone lies independence! Here I recognize no superiors! Here I'm free!<ref>{{cite wikisource |last=Verne |first=Jules |translator=Frederick Paul Walter |title=20,000 Leagues Under the Seas |wslink=20,000 Leagues Under the Seas (Walter)/Chapter 10 |origyear=1870 |year=1991 |isbn=978-1-43844-663-9 |noicon=yes}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:20000 graveyard.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo standing over the crew of the ''Nautilus'' as they observe an underwater funeral]]\n\nNemo is devoted to his crew and grieves deeply when one is killed in the [[giant squid]] attack in the [[Caribbean Sea]], or after a midnight encounter with a surface ship. He shows the same compassion in his treatment of the castaways in ''The Mysterious Island'', and retains a strong attachment to his deceased wife and children. Though short-tempered, he rarely expresses his anger. He is also a man of immense courage, in the forefront of every activity, from releasing the ''Nautilus'' from the Antarctic ice to fighting squid in the Caribbean; and notable for having worked consecutive eight-hour shifts without a break, with little oxygen, to free the ''Nautilus'' from the ice. He was also identified as having discovered [[Atlantis]].\n\nAn extraordinary engineer, Nemo has designed and built the ''Nautilus'', besides inventing her electric propulsion and navigation systems. He has an exceptional mastery of underwater navigation, taking upon himself the most difficult submarine passages, such as those under the [[Suez|Isthmus of Suez]] and the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\n[[File:20000 Nautilus Salon.jpg|upright|thumb|The Grand Salon of the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'']]\n\nHe has a comprehensive knowledge of [[marine biology]], and it is his respect for Professor Aronnax's expertise in the field which led to his befriending the professor when the latter was cast upon the ''Nautilus''. Further, he is said to have read and annotated all the books he possessed in the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} vast library.\n\nHe has very fine taste in art, possessing several masterpieces of both painting and sculpture, from ancient and modern European masters, all of which are housed in the Grand Salon of the ''Nautilus'', along with his collection of [[pearl]]s, [[coral]]s and other such marine products, which he had gathered himself. In the opinion of Professor Aronnax, the collection of the Grand Salon far outstrips that of the [[Louvre]]. Despite the opulence visible all through the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', Nemo's cabin was furnished with little beside a bed and the navigational instruments integral to the ''Nautilus''. Captain Nemo is believed to be extremely affluent, in that while he never states exactly how much he is worth, he claims that 'without missing it, he could pay the national debt of France'.  At the time of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''{{'s}} publication, this was worth 4.6 billion francs, or $18.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2018.\n\nNemo tells Professor Aronnax that his intention was to have his autobiography sealed in an unsinkable casket and thrown overboard by the last survivor of the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} crew, in the hope that it would be washed up somewhere. Accordingly an unsinkable casket does wash up in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (wherein is revealed Nemo's background story), containing tools, guns, navigation instruments, an atlas, books, blank paper, and even clothing. The crate is lashed to empty barrels, and the contents sealed in a waterproof zinc envelope, showing careful preparation and packing. Throughout the same book, Nemo acts as an agent of [[Divine Providence]], as when the sailor Pencroff laments the absence of [[tobacco]], and a hunting party discover a plant that the young naturalist Harbert identifies as such. The other castaways keep the discovery secret until they can dry and cure the leaves. One evening, Pencroff is offered some coffee by his friends. When he declines, they say, \"A pipe, then?\" and produce a homemade pipe stuffed full, with a coal to light it. Pencroff exclaims, \"O, divine Providence! sacred Author of all things!&nbsp;... Nothing more is now wanting to our island\".<ref>{{cite wikisource |last=Verne |first=Jules |translator=Agnes Kinloch Kingston |title=The Mysterious Island |wslink=The Mysterious Island/Part 2/Chapter 10 |origyear=1874 |year=1875 |noicon=yes}}</ref>\n\n== Emblem ==\n\nHis emblem, as given in a description of the flag he raised when claiming [[Antarctica]], is a large golden '''''N''''' on a black field. The motto of the ''Nautilus'' was ''Mobilis in mobili'', which may be roughly translated from Latin as, \"moving amidst mobility\", \"moving within the moving element\", or \"changing in the changes\".\n\n[[File:20000 mobilis in mobili.jpg|center|thumb|The [[motto]] of the ''Nautilus'']]\n\n== Origin ==\n\nIn the initial draft of ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'', Nemo was a [[szlachcic|Polish noble]], a member of the [[szlachta]], resenting the murder of his family during the Russian repression of the [[January Uprising]]; but Verne's editor [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]] feared a book ban in the Russian market and offending a French ally, the [[Russian Empire]], and had Verne obscure Nemo's motivation in the first book.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Mike |last=Perschon |url=http://www.verniana.org/volumes/02/A4/Perschon.pdf |title=Finding Nemo: Verne's Antihero as Original Steampunk |journal=Verniana: Jules Verne Studies |volume=2 |date=February 1, 2010 |pages=181\u2013182}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Jess |last=Nevins |title=The Encyclopedia of Fantastic Victoriana |location=Austin, Texas |publisher=Monkeybrain Books |year=2005 |page=128 |isbn=978-1-93226-515-6}}</ref> In the second book of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea'', Nemo comes close to revealing his Indian ancestry, though this is not obvious except in retrospect, where he saves a [[Sri Lanka|Ceylonese]] pearl-fisher in the [[Gulf of Mannar]].\n\n=== Chronological inconsistency ===\n\n''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' was written between 1869 and 1870 and records the voyages of the ''Nautilus'' between 1866 and 1868. ''The Mysterious Island'' was written in 1874 but is set immediately after the [[American Civil War]], from 1861 to 1865. This would mean that Captain Nemo who appeared in ''The Mysterious Island'' dies ''before'' Captain Nemo who appeared in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' sets out on the undersea travels. Also, when Captain Nemo is finally seen in ''The Mysterious Island'', he mentions having met Aronnax 16 years previously.\n\nMany errors in the original French first printing (the 'grand in-8' published by [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]]) are likely the fault of the editors who, at that time, were unlikely to consult the authors of the books they edited before making a change.  According to the new, full translation put out by the [[Naval Institute Press]], nearly all errors can be attributed to the editors, with only a few being the fault of Jules Verne, who was otherwise meticulous.  The inconsistency of the dates between ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' is perhaps evidence in this argument, as it seems unlikely that Verne would make such an obvious gaffe.\n\nThe ''Nautilus'' goes down in the [[Maelstrom]] on June 2, 1868, according to ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', but may have survived. (''The Mysterious Island'' gives this date as June 22, 1867.) Captain Nemo dies on the ''Nautilus'' under Lincoln Island in ''The Mysterious Island'' on October 15, 1868. Therefore, some chronological inconsistencies still exist: Cyrus and Gideon knew of Captain Nemo years before Aronnax published his story, Nemo being trapped under Lincoln Island all during the time in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''.\n\n== Portrayals ==\nIn most subsequent media adaptations of ''20,000 Leagues'' and ''Mysterious Island'', Nemo is (in a deviation from Verne's novels) depicted as a European.
