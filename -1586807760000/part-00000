In particular, scholars have looked at how the media's tendency to cover climate change in different cultural contexts, with different audiences or political positions (for example [[Fox News]]'s dismissive coverage of climate change news), and the tendency of newsrooms to cover climate change as a issue of uncertainty or debate, in order to give a sense of balance.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n=== Popular culture ===\n{{Main|Global warming in popular culture}}\nFurther research has explored how popular media, like the film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' and popular documentary [[An Inconvenient Truth]] change public perceptions of climate change.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Effective climate communication ==\nEffective climate communications require audience and contextual awareness. Different organizations have published guides and frameworks based on experience in climate communications. This section documents those various guidelines.\n\n=== By experts ===\nThe [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] published a handbook of guidance for IPCC authors about effective climate communication.

Since its adoption, the IIHS has noticed several automakers making non-symmetrical modifications to their vehicles, the Rogue being one of them. Another Small Overlap Test was conducted on a number of vehicles including a 2014 Rogue, but was conducted on the passenger side instead. Based on this test, the Rogue would have received a \"Marginal\" rating if the IIHS were to provide ratings for passenger-side protection. The crash test's intrusion was 10 inches further into the vehicle on the passenger's side than on the driver's side and completely tore off the structural door hinge pillar on the passenger side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|title=Passengers at risk in small overlap crashes|website=www.iihs.org|access-date=2016-09-04|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901003219/http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|archivedate=2016-09-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Rogue was redesigned for the 2014 model year.

Since its adoption, the IIHS has noticed several automakers making non-symmetrical modifications to their vehicles, the Rogue being one of them. Another Small Overlap Test was conducted on a number of vehicles including a 2014 Rogue, but was conducted on the passenger side instead. Based on this test, the Rogue would have received a \"Marginal\" rating if the IIHS were to provide ratings for passenger-side protection. The crash test's intrusion was 10 inches further into the vehicle on the passenger's side than on the driver's side and completely tore off the structural door hinge pillar on the passenger side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|title=Passengers at risk in small overlap crashes|website=www.iihs.org|access-date=2016-09-04|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901003219/http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|archivedate=2016-09-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Rogue was redesigned for the 2014 model year.

The reduction in controls on [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] has initiated a freer atmosphere for [[sexual expression]]. More and more people now regard [[sexual rights]] as basic [[human rights]], so that everyone has the right and freedom to pursue his or her own sexual bliss.<ref name=\"A people's sexual revolution in China\">David Barboza. [http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/03/04/news/shanghai.php A people's sexual revolution in China]. ''Internal Herald Tribune'' March 4, 2007</ref>\n\nChange in the field of [[Human sexual behavior|sexuality]] reveals not only a change of sexual attitudes and behaviors but also a series of related social changes via the process of [[social transformation]]. From the [[sociological]] perspective, there have been several main factors that have created the current turning point in the contemporary Chinese social context.\n\n==Contemporary history==\nSince the early 1980s sex and sexuality have become prominent themes of public debate in China, after three decades during which discourses on sexuality were subject to stringent ideological controls.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=978-0-7456-5613-7|edition=1|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>\n\n===Market reform and opening-up policy===\nThe denial of the ideals of the [[Cultural Revolution]], during which sex was used as a political tool to control people, is an influential factor in making changes in Chinese society.<ref name=\"A people's sexual revolution in China\"/> During the Cultural Revolution, individual sexual preferences were supposed to give way to lofty revolutionary ideals. Extramarital affairs were portrayed as a degenerate lifestyle, and consensual pre-marital sex was immoral. [[Homosexuality]] was illegal and would be punished under the statutes for [[hooliganism]]. A person had to be sexually well-behaved in order to get a promotion or advance in his or her [[career]].<ref name=\"IESC Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#6 Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref>\n\nReforms in the area of sexuality show a lessening amount of government control over individuals' private life. Many sex-related issues and personal lifestyles are no longer relegated to the field of [[politics]] and thus exempt from severe legal punishment or moral condemnation. Sex has been returned to the personal sphere under the domain of self-management. These changes can be seen in the weakened interference and control of the government in sex-related areas, strengthened sexual resources in the open market, a diversity of sexual lifestyles, and a strong appeal for sexual rights as human rights.\n\nFor instance, the government's control of personal lives has gradually retreated since the passing of the new marriage registration principles in October 2003, which again simplified the processes of [[marriage]] and [[divorce]]. The committed parties no longer need certification or confirmation from their place of work or the local Resident Committee to get married or divorced. The pre-marital physical, which among other things once contained an indication of the woman's [[virginity]], is no longer obligatory. The new principles reflect a greater respect for human rights, a protection of marital freedom, and a change in the governmental function with regards to sexual issues.\n\nAt the same time, some major social policies have also played an important part. For example, the side effect of the family planning policy is to promote a separation of sexual behavior from [[reproduction|reproductive]] purposes. If a couple can give birth to one child only, sexual behavior is no longer solely practiced to produce babies but also for pleasure. Changes in the legal code have reflected this while also publicly acknowledging sex as a pursuit of happiness.\n\n===Stable economic development and consumerism===\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nUnder recent policies, the social economy has seen stable and sustainable growth, especially in big cities. Material wealth and an increase in [[quality of life]] have brought [[optimism]] and [[consumerism]] which continually send messages to the individual that it is acceptable to seek sexual happiness.<ref name=\"A people's sexual revolution in China\"/>\n\nVarious [[sex products]] are now openly sold in the market. Sexual information is spreading directly or indirectly through such public media as street-side [[advertising]]. Fewer people turn away when they see intimate behavior between lovers in public. [[Condom]] [[vending machines]] are seen on [[campuses]]. Products for [[safe sex]] are available in [[convenience stores]] around city. Even major [[radio]] and [[television]] stations have started picking up on sex-related topics. Educational programs on sex have become popular. [[Video shop]]s, big or small, sell sexually oriented films produced either by domestic or foreign directors. More sexual information can also be quickly and easily found on the [[Internet]]. Intermingled information, good or bad, has pushed aside many of the traditional [[sexual taboo]]s and thus shaken the norm of sexual practice.\n\nThe pursuit of [[profit (economics)|profit]] may well push sexual minorities such as [[gay]]s and [[lesbians]] to appeal for their rights not just for legal reasons but also to tap into their particular market niches.<ref name=\"IESC Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors\"/> In a stable, developing economy and consumer culture, an emphasis on individual enjoyment and a respect for differentiation and diversity are now well established and perhaps even flourishing in an atmosphere of confidence and optimism.\n\n===Growth of the middle class===\nOne very important factor driving the social change in contemporary China is the great changes in and reorganization of social stratification. One of the most important features is [[white collar workers]] \u2014 the rise of the new [[middle class]] in China. The new middle class tends to stress their personal happiness and pay more attention to their own quality of life.\n\nBased on observations, all the visible changes in sexual discourse \u2014 including those in [[gay culture]] \u2014 can be considered a part of middle class culture. Most of the related website owners and participants belong to the white collar workers group. The new lifestyle in sexuality fields such as the [[DINKY|DINK]] \u2014 \"double income, no kids\"\u2014family, single groups, and cohabitating couples who violate the traditional sex norms are led by middle-class people. They are also the target groups for most gay bars, dating parties, so-called \"dating on Saturday\" programs, and sports groups, among others, in [[Chinese cities]].\n\nThe rise and growth of this middle class has the potential to produce various sexual [[emancipation]] discourses, including homosexuality, to break the silence in Chinese society.\n\n===Globalization===\nSince China adopted the policies of opening up and market reform, globalization has meant that there have been many people traveling across countries and from one region to another in China. It means information sharing, product sharing, capital flow, and value sharing, which increasingly includes some basic understanding of sexual rights, [[gender equality]], and [[human rights]]. The country's various projects on sexuality, [[reproductive health]], and [[AIDS prevention]] each have raised people's awareness of sexuality. Some non-profit international or national organizations are also working in China, while at the same time the international academic community, together with Chinese scholars, is sponsoring workshops and conferences for research on sexuality.<ref>Elain Jeffreys (1997) ''Sex and Sexuality in China''.

[[Beijing]] comes a close second, at 53 percent. In the same year, the nation's gross entrance rate into higher education has not yet reached 19 percent. More than half of the population aged 18 to 22 in Shanghai and Beijing can get access to some form of higher education.\n\nThe impact of higher education has been significant. The younger generation may adopt a different sexual ideology from the older generation because they have more opportunities to get exposure to humanities and [[social sciences]].<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\"/> They are more geared toward the pursuit of equality, freedom, and self-realization. At the same time, society pays more and more attention to elite [[intellectuals]] such as professors, researchers, lawyers, and policy-making consultants. Their opinions and ideas are expressed to the public in media reports and at conferences. The spreading of knowledge has been the most influential way to eliminate sex discrimination and sex inequality.<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\"/>\n\n==Feminist discourse in China==\n[[Gender equality]] has been one of China's national policies. The [[Cultural Revolution]] slogan \"Women can hold up half the sky\" is well known. Many organizations and centers for gender were established after the Fourth UN Conference on Women was held in Beijing in 1995.<ref>[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/index.html Fourth World Conference on Women], Beijing, China - September 1995, Action for Equality, Development and Peace.</ref> The government sponsored the conference and then signed the UN documents pledging gender equality, and official women's organizations and feminist activists and scholars have been fighting against gender discrimination and working on achieving gender equality. Their struggle has permeated many aspects of the people's social lives.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#1 Basic Sexological Premises] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref>\n\nMainstream [[feminist]] discourse in China tends to ignore sexuality issues, considering those topics either unimportant or as stirring up unnecessary trouble. Nevertheless, the critical thinking of feminist discourse has challenged stereotyped gender roles, including sexuality roles. The latter especially has influenced many young people.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\"/>\n\nThe role of feminist discourse in the field of sexuality has been to redefine a woman's sex role. It criticized the double standards of sex between women and men, which included traditionally held norms such as that men should be aggressive and active, women passive and inactive; that men should have stronger sexual desires and women weaker; that men should be sexually experienced before marriage but women retain their virginity; that women should not ask too much for sex and should consider men's satisfaction as their own. The critical feminist discourse is also rewriting the gender views in Chinese society. Some feminist scholars have started to emphasize women's sexual rights and the diversity of sexuality among Chinese women. Thus China's sexual revolution is also women's sexual revolution, as evidenced by these trends.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\"/>\n\nWhile women in previous generations were expected to marry in their twenties, many highly educated women are deciding to hold off on marriage into their 30s or longer. Their increased economic power has given them autonomy so they don't need to rely on a spouse. But the Chinese media has still given them a derogatory name, ''shengnu'' (\u5269\u5973) or \"leftover women\".<ref>{{cite web|title=China's Successful Ladies See Shrinking Pool of Mr. Right|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-women-marriage-education-employment|publisher=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting|accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, China added new provisions to the ''Law on Women's Right Protection'' to include sexual harassment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4625913.stm |title=China to outlaw sexual harassment |publisher=BBC News |date=27 June 2005 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>  In 2006 \"The Shanghai Supplement\" was drafted to help further define sexual harassment in China.<ref>{{cite news|last=Li |first=Cao |last2=South |first2=Mark |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-10/27/content_718147.htm |title=Draft bill details sexual harassment |publisher=China Daily |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>\n\n==Role of the media and the Internet==\nThe [[Media of China|media]] is the catalytic agent of sexual revolution in China. The [[Internet in China|Internet]], too, is one of the most prominent agents wielding important influence among the Chinese people through promoting alliances, sharing knowledge, and providing a platform where various voices can be heard. There are numerous individuals who come to accept their sexual identity mainly because of the Internet. The Internet is a powerful channel for people to find sexual partners, to organize off-line activities, or just simply to have access to sexual knowledge and sex-related information.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=9780745656137|pages=69\u201395|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>\n\nThe Internet has also been a great proponent of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) identity in China. Since the late 1990s, members of the LGBT community have used the Internet to access and share information, form relationships, and cultivate queer identities and communities. However, despite the seemingly unconstrained development of the LGBT community in the global cyberspace, there are constraints. Some constraints are informed by socio-economic factors. There are some gay, lesbian and queer people who cannot afford a computer and access to the Internet at home and therefore are obliged to use Internet cafes, where they may be compelled to avoid certain websites for fear of being monitored by other people. Some constraints are politically informed. Gay and lesbian-oriented websites tend to be short-lived due to Internet regulations and controls of the government. Furthermore, despite an online proliferation of the LGBT identity, the community remains subordinate to China's hegemonic discourse on sexuality. Rarely do traditional Chinese media outlets recognise LGBT identity, let alone embrace and validate the community.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=9780745656137|pages=69\u201395|edition=1st|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>\n\n==Sexual revolution==\nIn [[Putonghua|Chinese language]], ''xingkaifang'' ({{linktext|\u6027|\u5f00|\u653e}}) is the phrase to describe the sexual opening-up,<ref name=\"James Farrer\">James Farrer (2002) ''Opening Up: Youth sex culture and market reform in Shanghai'' page 24. {{ISBN|0-226-23871-7}}</ref> \"a [[globalization|globalizing]] sexual culture prevailing China.\"<ref name=\"James Farrer\" />\n[[Urbanization]] in China has been accelerating the sexual revolution by providing people with more private space and freedom to enjoy sex, as compared with what was afforded by the traditional countryside way of life.

It provides both opportunities and risks. Sexuality has to be openly discussed because of AIDS concerns. For example, in the summer of 2005, [[China Central Television]] discussed the topic of AIDS under the title \"Homosexuality: Confronting is Better than Evading.\" Scholars and activists have gained the legitimacy to talk publicly about the so-called \"high risk\" groups such as gay men and sex workers and have been developing strategies to work together with the government, replacing strategies of attacking the \"evil\" with models for caring for those at risk.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\"/>\n\nSexuality, including homosexuality, has started to enter the public forum. The whole process is still ongoing, but it is breaking the silence on sexuality taboos. AIDS concerns also bring funding, and many organizations are working to fight the illness. The related knowledge and information on sexuality is spreading continuously among Chinese people, and it also strongly helps people to overcome the [[stereotypes]], [[bias]] and [[ignorance]] regarding AIDS and sexual health issues.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Homosexuality in China|Homosexuality]] and [[transgender in China]]\n*[[Prostitution in China]]\n*[[HIV/AIDS in China]]\n*[[Feminism in China]]\n*[[Love Land (China)]]\n*[[Taoist sexual practices]]\n*[[Back-up partner]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Evans Harriet (1997) ''Women and Sexuality in China: Dominant Discourses of Female Sexuality and Gender Since 1949''. {{ISBN|0-7456-1398-5}}\n*Elaine Jeffreys (editor) (2006) ''Sex and Sexuality in China''. {{ISBN|0-415-40143-7}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sexuality+in+China+today.-a0168586772 Sexuality in China today]\n*[[YouTube]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQUkv9dB-Dw China's Sexual Revolution]\n\n{{SexGenderPRChina}}\n{{Sexuality by country}}\n{{China topics|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Human sexuality}}\n", "text_old": "{{Essay|date=April 2010}}\n[[File:Love sign at Foreigners Street, Chongqing.JPG|thumb|\"Love\" sign at [[Foreigners' Street]] theme park in [[Chongqing]], southwest [[China]], location of the aborted [[Love Land (China)|Love Land]] sex theme park.]]\n'''Sexuality in China''' has undergone revolutionary changes and this \"[[sexual revolution]]\" still continues today.<ref name=\"IESC Demographics and a Historical Perspective\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#0 Demographics and a Historical Perspective] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref> [[China|Chinese]] sexual attitudes, behaviors, ideology, and relations have changed dramatically in the past decade of reform and opening up of the country.<ref name=\"IESC Demographics and a Historical Perspective\"/> Many of these changes have found expression in the public forum through a variety of behaviors and ideas.<ref name=\"IESC Demographics and a Historical Perspective\"/> These include, but are not limited to the following cultural shifts: a separation of [[sex]] and [[marriage]], such as [[premarital sex|pre-]] and [[extramarital sex]]; a separation of sex from [[love]] and [[child-bearing]] such as [[Internet sex]] and [[one-night stands]]; an increase in observable [[sexual diversity]] such as [[homosexuality|homo-]] and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] behavior and [[fetishism]]; an increase in socially acceptable displays and behaviors of female [[sexual desire]]; a boom in the [[sex industry]]; and a more open discussion of sex topics, including [[sex studies]] at colleges, media reports, formal publications, on-line information, extensive [[public health]] education, and [[public displays of affection]].<ref name=\"IESC Demographics and a Historical Perspective\"/>\n\nAs can be seen by these developments, China no longer exerts strict control over personal sexual behavior.<ref>Jiang Leiwen.

From the [[sociological]] perspective, there have been several main factors that have created the current turning point in the contemporary Chinese social context.\n\n==Contemporary history==\nSince the early 1980s sex and sexuality have become prominent themes of public debate in China, after three decades during which discourses on sexuality were subject to stringent ideological controls.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=978-0-7456-5613-7|edition=1|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>\n\n===Market reform and opening-up policy===\nThe denial of the ideals of the [[Cultural Revolution]], during which sex was used as a political tool to control people, is an influential factor in making changes in Chinese society.<ref name=\"A people's sexual revolution in China\"/> During the Cultural Revolution, individual sexual preferences were supposed to give way to lofty revolutionary ideals. Extramarital affairs were portrayed as a degenerate lifestyle, and consensual pre-marital sex was immoral. [[Homosexuality]] was illegal and would be punished under the statutes for [[hooliganism]]. A person had to be sexually well-behaved in order to get a promotion or advance in his or her [[career]].<ref name=\"IESC Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#6 Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref>\n\nReforms in the area of sexuality show a lessening amount of government control over individuals' private life. Many sex-related issues and personal lifestyles are no longer relegated to the field of [[politics]] and thus exempt from severe legal punishment or moral condemnation. Sex has been returned to the personal sphere under the domain of self-management. These changes can be seen in the weakened interference and control of the government in sex-related areas, strengthened sexual resources in the open market, a diversity of sexual lifestyles, and a strong appeal for sexual rights as human rights.\n\nFor instance, the government's control of personal lives has gradually retreated since the passing of the new marriage registration principles in October 2003, which again simplified the processes of [[marriage]] and [[divorce]]. The committed parties no longer need certification or confirmation from their place of work or the local Resident Committee to get married or divorced. The pre-marital physical, which among other things once contained an indication of the woman's [[virginity]], is no longer obligatory. The new principles reflect a greater respect for human rights, a protection of marital freedom, and a change in the governmental function with regards to sexual issues.\n\nAt the same time, some major social policies have also played an important part. For example, the side effect of the family planning policy is to promote a separation of sexual behavior from [[reproduction|reproductive]] purposes. If a couple can give birth to one child only, sexual behavior is no longer solely practiced to produce babies but also for pleasure. Changes in the legal code have reflected this while also publicly acknowledging sex as a pursuit of happiness.\n\n===Stable economic development and consumerism===\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nUnder recent policies, the social economy has seen stable and sustainable growth, especially in big cities. Material wealth and an increase in [[quality of life]] have brought [[optimism]] and [[consumerism]] which continually send messages to the individual that it is acceptable to seek sexual happiness.<ref name=\"A people's sexual revolution in China\"/>\n\nVarious [[sex products]] are now openly sold in the market. Sexual information is spreading directly or indirectly through such public media as street-side [[advertising]]. Fewer people turn away when they see intimate behavior between lovers in public. [[Condom]] [[vending machines]] are seen on [[campuses]]. Products for [[safe sex]] are available in [[convenience stores]] around city. Even major [[radio]] and [[television]] stations have started picking up on sex-related topics. Educational programs on sex have become popular. [[Video shop]]s, big or small, sell sexually oriented films produced either by domestic or foreign directors. More sexual information can also be quickly and easily found on the [[Internet]]. Intermingled information, good or bad, has pushed aside many of the traditional [[sexual taboo]]s and thus shaken the norm of sexual practice.\n\nThe pursuit of [[profit (economics)|profit]] may well push sexual minorities such as [[gay]]s and [[lesbians]] to appeal for their rights not just for legal reasons but also to tap into their particular market niches.<ref name=\"IESC Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors\"/> In a stable, developing economy and consumer culture, an emphasis on individual enjoyment and a respect for differentiation and diversity are now well established and perhaps even flourishing in an atmosphere of confidence and optimism.\n\n===Growth of the middle class===\nOne very important factor driving the social change in contemporary China is the great changes in and reorganization of social stratification. One of the most important features is [[white collar workers]] \u2014 the rise of the new [[middle class]] in China.

It means information sharing, product sharing, capital flow, and value sharing, which increasingly includes some basic understanding of sexual rights, [[gender equality]], and [[human rights]].

Their struggle has permeated many aspects of the people's social lives.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#1 Basic Sexological Premises] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref>\n\nMainstream [[feminist]] discourse in China tends to ignore sexuality issues, considering those topics either unimportant or as stirring up unnecessary trouble. Nevertheless, the critical thinking of feminist discourse has challenged stereotyped gender roles, including sexuality roles. The latter especially has influenced many young people.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\"/>\n\nThe role of feminist discourse in the field of sexuality has been to redefine a woman's sex role. It criticized the double standards of sex between women and men, which included traditionally held norms such as that men should be aggressive and active, women passive and inactive; that men should have stronger sexual desires and women weaker; that men should be sexually experienced before marriage but women retain their virginity; that women should not ask too much for sex and should consider men's satisfaction as their own. The critical feminist discourse is also rewriting the gender views in Chinese society. Some feminist scholars have started to emphasize women's sexual rights and the diversity of sexuality among Chinese women. Thus China's sexual revolution is also women's sexual revolution, as evidenced by these trends.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\"/>\n\nWhile women in previous generations were expected to marry in their twenties, many highly educated women are deciding to hold off on marriage into their 30s or longer. Their increased economic power has given them autonomy so they don't need to rely on a spouse. But the Chinese media has still given them a derogatory name, ''shengnv'' (\u5269\u5973) or \"leftover women\".<ref>{{cite web|title=China's Successful Ladies See Shrinking Pool of Mr. Right|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-women-marriage-education-employment|publisher=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting|accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, China added new provisions to the ''Law on Women's Right Protection'' to include sexual harassment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4625913.stm |title=China to outlaw sexual harassment |publisher=BBC News |date=27 June 2005 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>  In 2006 \"The Shanghai Supplement\" was drafted to help further define sexual harassment in China.<ref>{{cite news|last=Li |first=Cao |last2=South |first2=Mark |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-10/27/content_718147.htm |title=Draft bill details sexual harassment |publisher=China Daily |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>\n\n==Role of the media and the Internet==\nThe [[Media of China|media]] is the catalytic agent of sexual revolution in China. The [[Internet in China|Internet]], too, is one of the most prominent agents wielding important influence among the Chinese people through promoting alliances, sharing knowledge, and providing a platform where various voices can be heard. There are numerous individuals who come to accept their sexual identity mainly because of the Internet. The Internet is a powerful channel for people to find sexual partners, to organize off-line activities, or just simply to have access to sexual knowledge and sex-related information.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=9780745656137|pages=69\u201395|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>\n\nThe Internet has also been a great proponent of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) identity in China. Since the late 1990s, members of the LGBT community have used the Internet to access and share information, form relationships, and cultivate queer identities and communities. However, despite the seemingly unconstrained development of the LGBT community in the global cyberspace, there are constraints. Some constraints are informed by socio-economic factors. There are some gay, lesbian and queer people who cannot afford a computer and access to the Internet at home and therefore are obliged to use Internet cafes, where they may be compelled to avoid certain websites for fear of being monitored by other people. Some constraints are politically informed. Gay and lesbian-oriented websites tend to be short-lived due to Internet regulations and controls of the government. Furthermore, despite an online proliferation of the LGBT identity, the community remains subordinate to China's hegemonic discourse on sexuality. Rarely do traditional Chinese media outlets recognise LGBT identity, let alone embrace and validate the community.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=9780745656137|pages=69\u201395|edition=1st|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>\n\n==Sexual revolution==\nIn [[Putonghua|Chinese language]], ''xingkaifang'' ({{linktext|\u6027|\u5f00|\u653e}}) is the phrase to describe the sexual opening-up,<ref name=\"James Farrer\">James Farrer (2002) ''Opening Up: Youth sex culture and market reform in Shanghai'' page 24. {{ISBN|0-226-23871-7}}</ref> \"a [[globalization|globalizing]] sexual culture prevailing China.\"<ref name=\"James Farrer\" />\n[[Urbanization]] in China has been accelerating the sexual revolution by providing people with more private space and freedom to enjoy sex, as compared with what was afforded by the traditional countryside way of life.

It provides both opportunities and risks. Sexuality has to be openly discussed because of AIDS concerns. For example, in the summer of 2005, [[China Central Television]] discussed the topic of AIDS under the title \"Homosexuality: Confronting is Better than Evading.\" Scholars and activists have gained the legitimacy to talk publicly about the so-called \"high risk\" groups such as gay men and sex workers and have been developing strategies to work together with the government, replacing strategies of attacking the \"evil\" with models for caring for those at risk.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\"/>\n\nSexuality, including homosexuality, has started to enter the public forum. The whole process is still ongoing, but it is breaking the silence on sexuality taboos. AIDS concerns also bring funding, and many organizations are working to fight the illness. The related knowledge and information on sexuality is spreading continuously among Chinese people, and it also strongly helps people to overcome the [[stereotypes]], [[bias]] and [[ignorance]] regarding AIDS and sexual health issues.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Homosexuality in China|Homosexuality]] and [[transgender in China]]\n*[[Prostitution in China]]\n*[[HIV/AIDS in China]]\n*[[Feminism in China]]\n*[[Love Land (China)]]\n*[[Taoist sexual practices]]\n*[[Back-up partner]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Evans Harriet (1997) ''Women and Sexuality in China: Dominant Discourses of Female Sexuality and Gender Since 1949''. {{ISBN|0-7456-1398-5}}\n*Elaine Jeffreys (editor) (2006) ''Sex and Sexuality in China''. {{ISBN|0-415-40143-7}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sexuality+in+China+today.-a0168586772 Sexuality in China today]\n*[[YouTube]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQUkv9dB-Dw China's Sexual Revolution]\n\n{{SexGenderPRChina}}\n{{Sexuality by country}}\n{{China topics|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Human sexuality}}\n", "name_user": "Tototavros", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexuality_in_China"}

{"title_page": "Vehicle recovery", "text_new": "{{About|vehicle recovery|general information on trailering|Towing|more information on vehicles used in towing|Tow truck|the military practice, see|Vehicle recovery (military)}}\n{{multi|\n{{refimprove|date=November 2010}}\n{{Globalize|article|United Kingdom|2name=the United Kingdom|date=November 2010}}\n}}\n[[File:Xochisroad02.JPG|thumb|right|270px|Vehicle recovery in [[Guerrero]], [[Mexico]]]]\n'''Vehicle recovery''' is the recovery of any vehicle to another place, generally speaking with a commercial vehicle known as a ''recovery vehicle'', [[tow truck]] or spectacle lift.\n\nRecovery can take the form of general recovery, normally of broken down vehicles, or a Statutory Recovery at the request of the police using police powers, conferred in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Parliament]] using an Act.\n\n==General recovery ==\nThere are many types of organisations that carry out the recovery of disabled vehicles; however, they can be divided into two distinct areas: Recovery Operators (who undertake the recovery) and [[Motor club|Motoring Organisations]].\n\nMotoring organisations\u2014or as they are often known, 'The Clubs'\u2014are organisations to which the vehicle's driver will belong. They may have made a conscious effort to do this, or they may have got the membership with their new vehicle, through a company scheme, or purchased with an insurance policy.\n\nIn the event that a member of the public does not have a \"club\" membership, the police or Highways Agency can arrange recovery of the vehicle at what is called an \"Owner's Request\" and they will arrange for help to attend.\n\nRecovery operators are the people who undertake the recovery. They are known by different names around the world, including 'patrols,' 'tow men' and 'wrecker drivers'. Some are the people used by the motoring organisations to rescue their members. A small percentage will be on the payroll of the motoring organisation and will work exclusively for them. Examples are the patrols used by the AA, RAC and Mondial in the UK. Most recovery operators, however, work for privately owned companies or are individuals. They can do large volumes of work for some of the motoring organisations, but they will normally also do work for the public. In Europe, the percentage of this 'private' work is low due to the high profiles of the motoring organisations. Of course some will never do work for the motoring organisations, preferring to work just for their own customers. In the USA, motoring organisations are still growing.\n\nAlthough there have always been auto repair shops and garages who towed or recovered any vehicles, it is only really in the last fifty years that vehicle recovery has become an industry distinct from the auto repair trade. Many are still involved in workshop repairs, but an increasing number, if they cannot repair the vehicle by the roadside, will transport it to another repairer. Although there are some large organisations operating hundreds of recovery vehicles, most are family businesses operating typically between 10 and 50 vehicles. Lastly there are operators like Highway Authorities and other government bodies, operators of local recovery schemes (contra flows, etc.) and large fleet operators who recover their own vehicles.\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the towing and recovery of motor vehicles has closely followed the history of the [[automobile]] itself. In its early days, towing was often achieved by attaching a horse to the disabled vehicle and pulling it home. Many of the first automobile repair shops had been bicycle repairers or blacksmiths, and they quickly adapted to recovering their customers' disabled vehicles. To achieve this, specialised recovery vehicles were often built. As automobiles have grown more sophisticated it has become much harder for the average vehicle owner to diagnose and repair a fault. Thus, a huge and specialised vehicle recovery industry has evolved to serve and support them.\n\nMotoring organisations or clubs have been created to sell [[breakdown cover]]age to automobile drivers, particularly popular in Europe. Automobile manufacturers will often purchase bulk membership from the motoring organisations, to give away with new vehicle sales. These are usually 'badged' with the manufacturer's name. A large number of these motoring organisations do not operate recovery vehicles of their own, but instead use independent recovery operators as agents. Those clubs that have their own vehicles often also use independent agents to assist with specialist work, or when their own resources are stretched. Police forces also use independent recovery operators to move vehicles, for example after a [[car accident]], when vehicles are illegally parked and when required for examination.\n\n=== UK ===\n[[Image:Aarec.jpg|right|An early AA relay vehicle from around 1973.]]\n\nEarly motorists were often capable of carrying out minor repairs themselves, but as automobiles became more complicated, this became more difficult to carry out successfully. Some early local motoring clubs tried to support their members by encouraging them to help each other. A rota of members who would help other members was kept, and in some cases, cash was put aside to hire a tow vehicle if needed. By the start of the 20th century, some motoring clubs had become large enough to offer roadside assistance service. In the UK, they were [[The Automobile Association]] (formed in 1905) and the [[Royal Automobile Club]] (formed in 1897 and named Royal in 1907). The services offered were limited to repairs if possible, if not a tow to local garage or the driver's home if nearby (in all cases a limit of 20 miles). During the 1950s, both clubs installed radios to allow them to dispatch patrols straight to the incident. Prior to this, the patrols had needed to go to a patrol box and 'phone in' to see if there were any jobs available.\n\nIn 1969 and 1970, a number of Midland-based recovery clubs were formed and started to offer a 'get you home service' from anywhere in the UK. The largest of these was National Breakdown Recovery Club (today known as [[Green Flag]]), who also offered to cover you if you had an accident, something almost unheard of up until then. But today scenario is quite different, there are so many entrants into this business. They provide various other services which includes unwanted vehicle removal services, vehicle storage services.\n\nUnlike the AA and RAC, these new clubs did not operate patrols or have their own recovery vehicles. Instead, they recruited recovery operators to work as their agents. These agents were selected from the best garages and coachworks. Inspections of the equipment and facilities were regularly carried out, by the clubs' own inspectors. Within a few years the AA and then the RAC responded with their own get you home or relay services.\n\n===United States ===\nAmerican recovery operators were created to serve the needs of their own customers, rather than of club members as in Europe. Most purchased or built their equipment to tow work into their auto repair shops.  Ernest Holmes, one of the older suppliers of recovery equipment, used a line in his advertisements that said \"''The big profit jobs don't drive in, they are towed in.''\" As in Europe there are some 'recovery only' operators, but nothing like the same percentage as most also operate repair facilities.\n\n== Recovery equipment ==\n{{Further|Tow truck}}\nModern recovery equipment is extremely sophisticated and manufactured in quantity throughout the world. However up until the mid-seventies a large proportion of the equipment in use was homemade, often just consisting of a ridged jib and a simple block and tackle. After both World Wars, a number of army surplus vehicles were purchased cheaply by operators and converted to civilian use. This was especially true for recovering [[truck]]s and other commercial vehicles.\n\nIn 1918, [[Ernest Holmes]] of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] patented the first American commercially successful vehicle recovery crane, and its modern descendants have changed little since. Around the same time, recovery cranes were being produced by Weaver Manufacturing and Manley. In Europe, Harvey Frost Ltd of Great Portland Street, London, started selling recovery cranes made by Ernest Lake from around 1905. The first major change to these crane designs would take another fifty years and came from Sweden. Olaf Ekengard, under the trade name EKA, designed and marketed a crane that lifted from underneath the subject vehicle. Nearly all lift and tow vehicles today use variations of his idea, while traditional cranes are kept for specialist work.\n\n[[Image:Grouprec.jpg|thumb|right|A typical assortment of recovery vehicles]]\n\nA typical modern recovery fleet will operate a great diversity of different types of recovery and support vehicles. This will include basic service vans, mobile workshops, lift and tow vehicles often called [[tow truck]]s, transporters and trailers. It is not uncommon for them to also operate mobile cranes, road going fork lifts, articulated tractor units and incident support vehicles.\n\nIn some locations they may also operate off-road vehicles and even boats. All will have specialised vehicle body styles, to best achieve the job they were designed to do.\n\n===Types of tow===\n{{See also|Towing|Tow truck}}\nThere are five main methods of vehicle recovery:\n\n==== Soft ====\nUsed for very short distances where a rope, chain, or a length of webbing is attached to the casualty, which must have a working braking system as it will be used to slow both vehicles. This can be dangerous, unless both drivers are competent enough to do it. Although many people believe this is illegal on motorways it is not in Europe, as long as the relevant trailer laws are complied with, i.e., correctly configured lights and signing, observing trailer speed limits, etc. In the US this is simply called a \"flat tow\", and it is not common practice to use the brakes of the rear vehicle to stop both vehicles. As typically a car is being flat towed because the engine won't run, and without a running engine the power brakes don't work, it could be dangerous as well as difficult to slow and stop two vehicles using only the brakes that only half function. Instead, it is typical for the towing vehicle to drive normally, but avoiding sharp acceleration or braking. All the person driving the rear vehicle has to do is gently apply the brakes whenever the tow chain begins to slacken, and anticipate stops so he or she can drag the brakes and come to a halt without excessive slack in the chain. This still requires a relatively skilled driver, as neither the power brakes or power steering will function, and you must take care to steer wide in sharp corners and never allow the chain to slacken, or it may get jerked and broken, or worse, drag underneath the vehicle and possibly cause damage or even loss of control.\n\n==== Rigid (or bar) ====\nUsed for very short distances where a solid metal bar is attached to the casualty. Used mainly with commercial vehicles, which often have a towing eye in the front bumper. In the case of cars and light vans, the towing vehicle can be used for braking, if the bar is kept straight. With commercial vehicles, it is common to connect an air feed to the casualty to allow the tow vehicle's brakes to also operate the casualty's brakes. In the US, both \"soft\" and \"rigid\" tows are called \"flat tows\", although if a rigid bar is used it may be called a \"bar tow\".\n\n==== Lift tow (suspend tow crane) ====\nNow rarely used, but for many years the only way to move a disabled vehicle without using a low loader or trailer. Chains were attached, usually around the casualty's suspension, and some form of packing (often a seat squab or tyre) was inserted between the lifting frame and the casualty. This frame was lifted by means of a pulley until the casualty\u2019s wheels were clear of the ground. An 'A' frame was normally used to keep the casualty from running into the tow vehicle on braking.\n\n==== Lift (underlift) ====\n[[File:Rearlift.jpg|thumb|right|A recovery vehicle performs a lift tow]]\nThe lift tow is the most common modern method for short distance transportation. The casualty is winched onto a lifting grid and then raised by lifting the grid, with the casualty\u2019s tires strapped to the grid. The grid is shaped like a large pair of spectacles, which accounts for the common name of this type of vehicle, the speclift or [[spectacle lift]]. With commercial vehicles, it is more common to use a set of lifting forks to attach to the suspension, axle or chassis of the casualty. In many cases, e.g., with automatics, it is the 'driven' wheels that need to be lifted. This will sometimes result in a rear lift, if the driven wheels are at the rear. In this case the casualty's steering ''must be locked'' in the straight ahead position.\n\nThe image on the right is interesting, in that it shows a 'speclift' that has been modified to do a standard chain lift as well. This is useful when the casualty will not fit into the speclift's frame, as in this case. You may also note that the rear is being lifted, as it clearly will not tow on a front lift (click the image to enlarge it).\n\n==== Transportation (total lift) ====\nThe preferred way to travel any distance. Usually the vehicles are purpose-built low-loading 'Transporters' although trailers are still used, especially for the movement of [[Coach (vehicle)|coaches]] and [[buses]]. Some transporter designs are very sophisticated, with bodies that 'demount' to give a low loading angle. This is especially useful for sports cars, etc., with low ground clearance. There are also transporters with totally enclosed bodies, used for example for the transportation of prestige vehicles, or vehicles involved in crime that are going for forensic analyses. In the sites it often common to see 'city loaders,' a type of transporter fitted with a cradle to totally suspend a vehicle for loading. These are often used to move illegally parked vehicles.\n\n==== Variations ====\nFor a long while, it was common to use 'dollies' to recover vehicles. These were cranes and underlifts as above, but mounted on a two-wheeled axle. They were designed to be towed behind a suitable towing vehicle. Another portable device was a crane, which clipped on to an articulated tractor unit's fifth wheel coupling. Popular in the seventies and eighties, they were cheap to buy (compared with a purpose-built recovery vehicle) and appealed to fleet operators, who could use them to recover their own vehicles. Total lift dollies were carried by some spectacle lifts to place under the wheels at the opposite end to the lifted wheels, thereby converting the half lift into a total lift. These are used, for example, when a vehicle has had an accident and both ends are damaged.\n\n==== Other equipment ====\n[[Image:Recovery kit.jpg|thumb|right|An example of equipment used around 1980 (click to enlarge)]]\nModern recovery vehicles come with a bewildering number of accessories. These include power units to supply air for power tools or pumping off vehicle braking systems, etc. Generators supply 110 or 220 volt mains power for floodlighting, tools, etc. There are different shaped forks for attaching to lift points, or for modifying standard lifting devices to allow them to transport motorbikes. Most vehicles will be equipped with an assortment of lifting strops or chains and webbing to secure loads. A special form of webbing called a [[snatch strap]] is sometimes carried to assist with vehicles that are bogged down in mud, etc.\n\nNearly all vehicles will be fitted with 12 or 24 volt 'jump start' or 'booster' sockets to start other vehicles with discharged batteries. Most will also have power [[winches]] to load the casualty, or for dislodging stuck vehicles. Some larger recovery vehicles will have two (or more) winches capable of pulling up to 30 tons per line. These will be used to winch back vehicles that have left the roadway.\n\nSome vehicles are fitted with luxurious multi-seat passenger compartments called crewcabs. These often have DVD players and even drink machines, for the benefit of the casualty's occupants on their trip home. Different types of rotatable cranes are sometimes fitted for lifting vehicles out of ditches, etc. Heavy lifting cranes are sometimes fitted and can be used for example to winch overturned vehicles back on their wheels.\n\nSome recovery vehicles are equipped as mobile workshops or service vans. They will carry a large selection of tools, spares and garage equipment, such as jacks and vehicle stands. In recent years many have also been equipped with spectacle lifts that fold away inside the rear doors. The advantage of this system is if the vehicle is not repairable, it can still be recovered without sending a second vehicle.\n\n[[Image:Hunterbelle.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n'Righting' an overturned vehicle, especially one that is not badly damaged, has become a science. When a commercial vehicle ends up on its side there will often be little clearance to slide lifting strops underneath it. Even if this can be done, the use of strops can cause further damage and are often not the right way to start a lift. To solve this problem, recovery operators often use air bags to at least start the lift of the casualty. A number of bags can be used and this spreads the load throughout the length of the vehicle. Only a low pressure is used, which means in the event a bag is punctured, it just gently deflates and does not explode. Once the casualty is above 45 degrees, a normal winch can be used to finish the job.\n\nIt is not uncommon to use a second winch from the opposite side, to gently lower the casualty once it has passed the point of balance. It is also quite common for recovery operators to be asked to move 'other' items. The picture at right, taken in the late eighties, shows a recovery crane lifting a [[Hawker Hunter]] aircraft before transporting it to [[Brooklands]] Museum in Weybridge, England.\n\n== Stolen vehicles ==\n{{see also|Motor vehicle theft#Recovery of stolen vehicles}}\n\nStolen vehicles found by the police require recovery services.<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Stolen Vehicle Recovery\n| accessdate = 2009-08-08\n| url = http://www.wiltshire.police.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=101:stolen-vehicle-recovery&Itemid=41\n}}</ref>\n\nStolen vehicles that are recovered are examined by the police for the investigation and then towed to the insurance company's designated tow yard.  The insurance company then contacts a certified crime scene inspection and decontamination expert to complete a Bio Safe.  Created by a Canadian firm in 1997, Bio Solutions,  the Bio Safe is a specialized inspection and decontamination service which must be performed to act accordingly with all government workplace standards to protect all employees involved in this crime scene from exposure to bio hazardous and hazardous material.  It is estimated that over 35% of stolen recovered vehicles contain hazards such as illegal drugs or contaminated paraphernalia such as used needles or crack pipes, semen and sputum.  Aside from a dry and warmer place to sleep for homeless people, these vehicles are often used for illegal activity such as prostitution, storage of and selling illegal material such as drugs or weapons.\n\nIn the early days of vehicle recovery, the driver of an automobile would have to contact his or her club or local garage in some way when it failed. Telephones were supplied for this purpose by some motoring organisations, and eventually the agencies responsible for the major roads networks would install them on some hard shoulders. Club patrols would also use the club's phone to check in for work, or wait at their depot for the calls to come in. In the fifties as mobile radios became more reliable, most clubs and some garages fitted them to their vehicles. This had a dramatic effect on ETAs as it was now often possible to divert a returning recovery vehicle before it got back.\n\nTo achieve the best use of their assets, all motoring organisations have invested heavily in [[Information Technology]]. Computer software is used to distribute work based on criteria such as nearest vehicle, right equipment (or spares) carried, and of course driver hours regulations. The vehicles are usually fitted with [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] devices, which transmit the vehicle\u2019s current location. Motoring organisation vehicles are also fitted with a [[Mobile Data Terminal]], allowing job details to be sent direct to the driver.\n\nMost recovery operators have also invested in IT. Most have job logging software and many have installed in-vehicle communication devices and [[GPS]] tracking devices. The distribution of work to the fleet is a very skilful job and the person doing it is often under intense strain. They are known as dispatchers in the USA and controllers in the UK. Because operators are expected to take calls 24 hours a day, some smaller ones pass their telephones to message services after hours.\n\nUniquely in the UK and Ireland the motoring organisations and the recovery operators have worked together to form a common standard for the communication of job details. The system is called [[Turbo Dispatch]] and was introduced in 1995. It uses a combination of [[Mobitex]] data radios and the [[Internet]] to communicate. Its main advantage is that it does away with the need for the information to be re-keyed into all the different computers in use and eliminates most of the delays associated with 'job taking'. If the information is put in correctly at the start, it will still be correct when the invoice is raised.\n\nIt was estimated at the European Tow Show in 2005 that 90% of all jobs dealt with by independent UK recovery operators are passed using the Turbo Dispatch system. The system allows a broken-down motorist to pass his details to the motoring organisation (usually by phone), but once they have entered his information into their computer, it can then be sent electronically to their agents. Apart from speed and accuracy, another advantage is that the message can have the casualty's Grid Coordinates built into it. This then allows the operator to rebroadcast it to the recovery vehicle, where the onboard [[Satellite navigation system|Satellite Navigation System]] can guide the driver to the incident, even if he does not know the area. The same system is also used to tell the motoring organisation when the recovery vehicle is on scene, when it is clear and what the outcome was.\n\n== Regulation ==\nThe towing and salvage industry can often be heavily regulated, particularly the part of industry  involved in this sort of work following road accidents.  The regulation can involve limitations on the numbers of vehicles able to operate in particular areas, particularly major cities, typically through licensing and post accident allocation schemes.   Controls have been imposed in States in [[Australia]], for example, in an attempt to avoid too many tow trucks attending road accident scenes and the potential for disputes arising among drivers seeking the same towing work.  The regulation can also extend to probity controls on industry participants.  An example of this sort of scheme is to be found in the [[Accident Towing Services Act]] enacted by the State of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Towing]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n 2.

They may have made a conscious effort to do this, or they may have got the membership with their new vehicle, through a company scheme, or purchased with an insurance policy.\n\nIn the event that a member of the public does not have a \"club\" membership, the police or Highways Agency can arrange recovery of the vehicle at what is called an \"Owner's Request\" and they will arrange for help to attend.\n\nRecovery operators are the people who undertake the recovery. They are known by different names around the world, including 'patrols,' 'tow men' and 'wrecker drivers'. Some are the people used by the motoring organisations to rescue their members. A small percentage will be on the payroll of the motoring organisation and will work exclusively for them. Examples are the patrols used by the AA, RAC and Mondial in the UK. Most recovery operators, however, work for privately owned companies or are individuals. They can do large volumes of work for some of the motoring organisations, but they will normally also do work for the public. In Europe, the percentage of this 'private' work is low due to the high profiles of the motoring organisations. Of course some will never do work for the motoring organisations, preferring to work just for their own customers. In the USA, motoring organisations are still growing.\n\nAlthough there have always been auto repair shops and garages who towed or recovered any vehicles, it is only really in the last fifty years that vehicle recovery has become an industry distinct from the auto repair trade. Many are still involved in workshop repairs, but an increasing number, if they cannot repair the vehicle by the roadside, will transport it to another repairer. Although there are some large organisations operating hundreds of recovery vehicles, most are family businesses operating typically between 10 and 50 vehicles. Lastly there are operators like Highway Authorities and other government bodies, operators of local recovery schemes (contra flows, etc.) and large fleet operators who recover their own vehicles.\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the towing and recovery of motor vehicles has closely followed the history of the [[automobile]] itself. In its early days, towing was often achieved by attaching a horse to the disabled vehicle and pulling it home. Many of the first automobile repair shops had been bicycle repairers or blacksmiths, and they quickly adapted to recovering their customers' disabled vehicles. To achieve this, specialised recovery vehicles were often built. As automobiles have grown more sophisticated it has become much harder for the average vehicle owner to diagnose and repair a fault. Thus, a huge and specialised vehicle recovery industry has evolved to serve and support them.\n\nMotoring organisations or clubs have been created to sell [[breakdown cover]]age to automobile drivers, particularly popular in Europe. Automobile manufacturers will often purchase bulk membership from the motoring organisations, to give away with new vehicle sales. These are usually 'badged' with the manufacturer's name. A large number of these motoring organisations do not operate recovery vehicles of their own, but instead use independent recovery operators as agents. Those clubs that have their own vehicles often also use independent agents to assist with specialist work, or when their own resources are stretched. Police forces also use independent recovery operators to move vehicles, for example after a [[car accident]], when vehicles are illegally parked and when required for examination.\n\n=== UK ===\n[[Image:Aarec.jpg|right|An early AA relay vehicle from around 1973.]]\n\nEarly motorists were often capable of carrying out minor repairs themselves, but as automobiles became more complicated, this became more difficult to carry out successfully. Some early local motoring clubs tried to support their members by encouraging them to help each other. A rota of members who would help other members was kept, and in some cases, cash was put aside to hire a tow vehicle if needed. By the start of the 20th century, some motoring clubs had become large enough to offer roadside assistance service. In the UK, they were [[The Automobile Association]] (formed in 1905) and the [[Royal Automobile Club]] (formed in 1897 and named Royal in 1907). The services offered were limited to repairs if possible, if not a tow to local garage or the driver's home if nearby (in all cases a limit of 20 miles). During the 1950s, both clubs installed radios to allow them to dispatch patrols straight to the incident. Prior to this, the patrols had needed to go to a patrol box and 'phone in' to see if there were any jobs available.\n\nIn 1969 and 1970, a number of Midland-based recovery clubs were formed and started to offer a 'get you home service' from anywhere in the UK. The largest of these was National Breakdown Recovery Club (today known as [[Green Flag]]), who also offered to cover you if you had an accident, something almost unheard of up until then. But today scenario is quite different, there are so many entrants into this business. They provide various other services which includes unwanted vehicle removal services, vehicle storage services.\n\nUnlike the AA and RAC, these new clubs did not operate patrols or have their own recovery vehicles. Instead, they recruited recovery operators to work as their agents. These agents were selected from the best garages and coachworks. Inspections of the equipment and facilities were regularly carried out, by the clubs' own inspectors. Within a few years the AA and then the RAC responded with their own get you home or relay services.\n\n===United States ===\nAmerican recovery operators were created to serve the needs of their own customers, rather than of club members as in Europe. Most purchased or built their equipment to tow work into their auto repair shops.  Ernest Holmes, one of the older suppliers of recovery equipment, used a line in his advertisements that said \"''The big profit jobs don't drive in, they are towed in.''\" As in Europe there are some 'recovery only' operators, but nothing like the same percentage as most also operate repair facilities.\n\n== Recovery equipment ==\n{{Further|Tow truck}}\nModern recovery equipment is extremely sophisticated and manufactured in quantity throughout the world.

The picture at right, taken in the late eighties, shows a recovery crane lifting a [[Hawker Hunter]] aircraft before transporting it to [[Brooklands]] Museum in Weybridge, England.\n\n== Stolen vehicles ==\n{{see also|Motor vehicle theft#Recovery of stolen vehicles}}\n\nStolen vehicles found by the police require recovery services.<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Stolen Vehicle Recovery\n| accessdate = 2009-08-08\n| url = http://www.wiltshire.police.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=101:stolen-vehicle-recovery&Itemid=41\n}}</ref>\n\nStolen vehicles that are recovered are examined by the police for the investigation and then towed to the insurance company's designated tow yard.  The insurance company then contacts a certified crime scene inspection and decontamination expert to complete a Bio Safe.  Created by a Canadian firm in 1997, Bio Solutions,  the Bio Safe is a specialized inspection and decontamination service which must be performed to act accordingly with all government workplace standards to protect all employees involved in this crime scene from exposure to bio hazardous and hazardous material.  It is estimated that over 35% of stolen recovered vehicles contain hazards such as illegal drugs or contaminated paraphernalia such as used needles or crack pipes, semen and sputum.  Aside from a dry and warmer place to sleep for homeless people, these vehicles are often used for illegal activity such as prostitution, storage of and selling illegal material such as drugs or weapons.\n\nIn the early days of vehicle recovery, the driver of an automobile would have to contact his or her club or local garage in some way when it failed. Telephones were supplied for this purpose by some motoring organisations, and eventually the agencies responsible for the major roads networks would install them on some hard shoulders. Club patrols would also use the club's phone to check in for work, or wait at their depot for the calls to come in. In the fifties as mobile radios became more reliable, most clubs and some garages fitted them to their vehicles. This had a dramatic effect on ETAs as it was now often possible to divert a returning recovery vehicle before it got back.\n\nTo achieve the best use of their assets, all motoring organisations have invested heavily in [[Information Technology]]. Computer software is used to distribute work based on criteria such as nearest vehicle, right equipment (or spares) carried, and of course driver hours regulations. The vehicles are usually fitted with [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] devices, which transmit the vehicle\u2019s current location. Motoring organisation vehicles are also fitted with a [[Mobile Data Terminal]], allowing job details to be sent direct to the driver.\n\nMost recovery operators have also invested in IT. Most have job logging software and many have installed in-vehicle communication devices and [[GPS]] tracking devices. The distribution of work to the fleet is a very skilful job and the person doing it is often under intense strain. They are known as dispatchers in the USA and controllers in the UK. Because operators are expected to take calls 24 hours a day, some smaller ones pass their telephones to message services after hours.\n\nUniquely in the UK and Ireland the motoring organisations and the recovery operators have worked together to form a common standard for the communication of job details. The system is called [[Turbo Dispatch]] and was introduced in 1995. It uses a combination of [[Mobitex]] data radios and the [[Internet]] to communicate. Its main advantage is that it does away with the need for the information to be re-keyed into all the different computers in use and eliminates most of the delays associated with 'job taking'. If the information is put in correctly at the start, it will still be correct when the invoice is raised.\n\nIt was estimated at the European Tow Show in 2005 that 90% of all jobs dealt with by independent UK recovery operators are passed using the Turbo Dispatch system. The system allows a broken-down motorist to pass his details to the motoring organisation (usually by phone), but once they have entered his information into their computer, it can then be sent electronically to their agents. Apart from speed and accuracy, another advantage is that the message can have the casualty's Grid Coordinates built into it. This then allows the operator to rebroadcast it to the recovery vehicle, where the onboard [[Satellite navigation system|Satellite Navigation System]] can guide the driver to the incident, even if he does not know the area. The same system is also used to tell the motoring organisation when the recovery vehicle is on scene, when it is clear and what the outcome was.\n\n== Regulation ==\nThe towing and salvage industry can often be heavily regulated, particularly the part of industry  involved in this sort of work following road accidents.  The regulation can involve limitations on the numbers of vehicles able to operate in particular areas, particularly major cities, typically through licensing and post accident allocation schemes.   Controls have been imposed in States in [[Australia]], for example, in an attempt to avoid too many tow trucks attending road accident scenes and the potential for disputes arising among drivers seeking the same towing work.  The regulation can also extend to probity controls on industry participants.  An example of this sort of scheme is to be found in the [[Accident Towing Services Act]] enacted by the State of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Towing]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''Wreck and Recovery'', Alan Thomas, 1987 Patrick Stephens Ltd.\n* ''Vehicle Recovery'', Ron Grice, 1977 Newnes Butterworths Ltd.\n* ''We the Professionals I, II, III'' all, Bill Jackson, 1983-1989 Wreckers International Ltd.\n* ''The World History of the Towing and Recovery Industry'', John Hawkins, TT Publications Inc.\n* ''The Motoring Century'' (the story of the RAC), Piers Brendon, 1997 Bloomsbury Publishing Plc\n* ''Breakdown Doctor'', Fred Henderson, 2005, Reading Room Publishing.\n* ''A History of Recovery Vehicles in the British Army'', Brian S Baxtor, 198 HMSO\n* ''Wreckers and Recovery Vehicles'', Bart H Vanderveen, 1972, Haynes Publishing Group\n* ''Wreckers and Tow Trucks'', Donald Wood, 1995, Motorbooks International\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.internationaltowingmuseum.org/ International Towing and Recovery Hall of Fame and Museum]\n*[http://www.riscuk.net/ Recovery Industry Support Charity UK]\n*[http://www.avrouk.com/ The Association of Vehicle Recovery Operators]\n*[http://www.theivr.com/ UK Institute of Vehicle Recovery]\n\n{{Road accidents}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vehicle Recovery}}\n[[Category:Traffic collisions]]\n[[Category:Emergency road services]]\n[[Category:Trucks]]\n", "name_user": "Helpme20020", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_recovery"}
