{"title_page": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Georg Dokoupil", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n[[File:JiriDokoupil.jpg|thumb| Jiri Georg Dokoupil, 2004]]\n'''Ji\u0159\u00ed \"Georg\" Dokoupil''' (born 3 June 1954) is a Czech-German painter and graphic artist. He was founding-member of the German artist group ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' and [[Junge Wilde|the Junge Wilde Art movement]], which arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s. \n\nDokoupil lives and works between [[Madrid]], [[Rio de Janeiro|Prag, Berlin, Rio de Janeiro]],  and [[Las Palmas|Las Palmas.]].\n\n==Biography==\nJi\u0159\u00ed Dokoupil was born in [[Krnov]], then [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1954. After the invasion of the Soviet army in Prague in 1968, he escaped with his family over Austria to Germany. In 1976 he began studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in [[Cologne]]. Later on he also attended classes at the Universities of Frankfurt and the [[Cooper Union]] in New York, where he studied among others under German concept artist [[Hans Haacke]]. The influence of Haacke is evident in Dokoupil\u2018s early work. From 1983\u201384 Dokoupil was guest professor at the Academy of Fine Arts of [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and 1989 in [[Madrid]].\n\nIn 1979 Dokoupil founded the group ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' with artists such as Gerhard Naschberger, Hans Peter Adamski, Gerard Kever, Peter B\u00f6mmels and Walter Dahn. The group was associated with the art dealer Paul Maenz who organised Dokoupil\u2018s first solo exhibition in 1982. In their shared studio in Cologne on a street named M\u00fclheimer Freiheit, the six [[Junge Wilde|Jungen Wilden]]  sought to explore a contemporary expression for their art by using a [[neoexpressionism|neoexpressive]], figurative style of intensely colourful painting with traditional subjects and by overriding the intellectual, reduced formal language of [[Minimalism|Minimal]] and [[Conceptual Art]]. \"I\u2019d come to realize that the conceptual artists had become liars,\" Dokoupil has said. \"What they had promised us was salvation, art without form. But I\u2019d go into a gallery and there would be nothing to see, and it would be for a lot of money \u2013 that just couldn\u2019t be it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://032c.com/2012/dokoupil/|title=Dokoupil|accessdate=December 13, 2013|publisher=032c}}</ref>   \n\nBut already in an early stage Dokoupil developed a less wild, rather unusual method of working and soon found his own radical subjective way with individual considerations. With his \"book painting\" shown at [[Documenta]] 7, [[Kassel]], in 1982, Dokoupil attracted the attention of the art world. It was a gigantic material painting called ''God, show me your balls'', a kind of homage to a [[Julian Schnabel]] plate painting, (which were made of broken ceramic dishes collaged into an image). Schnabel was not invited to participate in the exhibition \u2013 in Dokoupil\u2018s eyes a serious effront. Since then \u2013 besides the early group exhibitions with the ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' \u2013 Dokoupil's work has been seen in numerous one-man shows in galleries, museums and at other cultural sites worldwide.\n\n==Works==\nIn accordance with the thesis of Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]], Dokoupil never wanted to be subordinated to a personal or a forced style. He never developed a uniform style that would allow the observer to recognize his work. Rather he paraphrases different preceding styles, plays with them and invents new techniques. Only a certain expressivity and his affinity for eroticism may define  his world of images. His oeuvre today contains over 60 series and far more than 100 devised techniques or styles. A selection of his series is listed below.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*M\u00fclheimer Freiheit (1980\u20131981)\n*New School of Cologne (1982)\n*Blue Paintings about Love (1982)\n*Documenta Paintings (1982)\n*Theoretical Paintings (1983)\n*Terry Cloth Paintings (1983\u20131984)\n*The Pacifier Paintings (1984)\n*The Apple Maiden (1984)\n{{col-3}}\n*Children Paintings (1983\u20131985)\n*Corporations & Products (1985\u20131986)\n*Madonnas in Ecstasy (1985\u20131987)\n*Esoteric Paintings (1987)\n*Jesus Paintings (1986\u20131987)\n*Soot Paintings (Candle and Torch) (1989-today)\n*Mother's Milk Paintings (1989\u20131991)\n*Tire Paintings (1991\u20131992)\n{{col-3}}\n*Soap Bubble Paintings (1992-today)\n*The Green Paintings (1996)\n*Slavic Paintings (1996\u20131999)\n*Pigment Paintings (1998\u20132002)\n*Whip Paintings (2002\u20132003)\n*Buddha Paintings (2003\u20132004)\n*The Arrugadist Paintings (1999\u20132005)\n*Movie Paintings (2007\u20132009)\n{{col-end}}\n\nSince 1989 Dokoupil has developed the technique of ''Soot Paintings'', painting projected images with soot of a burning candle or in larger works with the flame of a torch onto a blank canvas hanging flat from the ceiling. The ''Soot Paintings'', often regarded as the most important series within Dokoupils oeuvre, contain different series such as the depictions of art auctions, the ''Subastas''- series, of 1989 or recent ones called ''Leopards''(2000\u20132009) or \"Christ\" paintings depicting Jesus Christ (a reference to his 1986/87 series of the Jesus paintings). For his ''Tire paintings'' of 1991\u20131992, he used freshly colour-dyed rolling tires on predominantly wet, ungrounded canvas. In his ''Soap Bubble Paintings'' of 1992-93 he lets soap-bubbles burst on canvas, while the liquid soap is mixed with colour or ink. In 2003 Dokoupil creates ''Whip Paintings'' by lashing a cowboy whip, which was stuck in a paint pot before, at the canvas. One of Dokoupil\u2018s most recent work is the series of spray-painted ''Buddhas'' on canvas. They are meant to be like [[Buddha]], [[Marilyn Monroe|Marilyn]] and [[Mona Lisa]] all at once, since [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]]\u2018s Marilyn is the Mona Lisa of the 20th century.\n\nEven though a retrospective of his oeuvre would resemble a group show of different painters, it has nothing to do with any pluralism of styles, with the claim of the coincidence of styles, or with a variety of [[post-irony|post-modern irony]]. The focus of his multifaceted oeuvre is in fact on exploring original techniques and configurations generating a domain for playful experimentation and physical tension in which new images can arise and assuring that the act of making images is independent of the iconographic compulsions of the media world today.

After the invasion of the Soviet army in Prague in 1968, he escaped with his family over Austria to Germany. In 1976 he began studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in [[Cologne]]. Later on he also attended classes at the Universities of Frankfurt and the [[Cooper Union]] in New York, where he studied among others under German concept artist [[Hans Haacke]]. The influence of Haacke is evident in Dokoupil\u2018s early work. From 1983\u201384 Dokoupil was guest professor at the Academy of Fine Arts of [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and 1989 in [[Madrid]].\n\nIn 1979 Dokoupil founded the group ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' with artists such as Gerhard Naschberger, Hans Peter Adamski, Gerard Kever, Peter B\u00f6mmels and Walter Dahn. The group was associated with the art dealer Paul Maenz who organised Dokoupil\u2018s first solo exhibition in 1982. In their shared studio in Cologne on a street named M\u00fclheimer Freiheit, the six [[Junge Wilde|Jungen Wilden]]  sought to explore a contemporary expression for their art by using a [[neoexpressionism|neoexpressive]], figurative style of intensely colourful painting with traditional subjects and by overriding the intellectual, reduced formal language of [[Minimalism|Minimal]] and [[Conceptual Art]]. \"I\u2019d come to realize that the conceptual artists had become liars,\" Dokoupil has said. \"What they had promised us was salvation, art without form. But I\u2019d go into a gallery and there would be nothing to see, and it would be for a lot of money \u2013 that just couldn\u2019t be it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://032c.com/2012/dokoupil/|title=Dokoupil|accessdate=December 13, 2013|publisher=032c}}</ref>   \n\nBut already in an early stage Dokoupil developed a less wild, rather unusual method of working and soon found his own radical subjective way with individual considerations. With his \"book painting\" shown at [[Documenta]] 7, [[Kassel]], in 1982, Dokoupil attracted the attention of the art world. It was a gigantic material painting called ''God, show me your balls'', a kind of homage to a [[Julian Schnabel]] plate painting, (which were made of broken ceramic dishes collaged into an image). Schnabel was not invited to participate in the exhibition \u2013 in Dokoupil\u2018s eyes a serious effront. Since then \u2013 besides the early group exhibitions with the ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' \u2013 Dokoupil's work has been seen in numerous one-man shows in galleries, museums and at other cultural sites worldwide.\n\n==Works==\nIn accordance with the thesis of Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]], Dokoupil never wanted to be subordinated to a personal or a forced style. He never developed a uniform style that would allow the observer to recognize his work. Rather he paraphrases different preceding styles, plays with them and invents new techniques. Only a certain expressivity and his affinity for eroticism may define  his world of images. His oeuvre today contains over 60 series and far more than 100 devised techniques or styles. A selection of his series is listed below.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*M\u00fclheimer Freiheit (1980\u20131981)\n*New School of Cologne (1982)\n*Blue Paintings about Love (1982)\n*Documenta Paintings (1982)\n*Theoretical Paintings (1983)\n*Terry Cloth Paintings (1983\u20131984)\n*The Pacifier Paintings (1984)\n*The Apple Maiden (1984)\n{{col-3}}\n*Children Paintings (1983\u20131985)\n*Corporations & Products (1985\u20131986)\n*Madonnas in Ecstasy (1985\u20131987)\n*Esoteric Paintings (1987)\n*Jesus Paintings (1986\u20131987)\n*Soot Paintings (Candle and Torch) (1989-today)\n*Mother's Milk Paintings (1989\u20131991)\n*Tire Paintings (1991\u20131992)\n{{col-3}}\n*Soap Bubble Paintings (1992-today)\n*The Green Paintings (1996)\n*Slavic Paintings (1996\u20131999)\n*Pigment Paintings (1998\u20132002)\n*Whip Paintings (2002\u20132003)\n*Buddha Paintings (2003\u20132004)\n*The Arrugadist Paintings (1999\u20132005)\n*Movie Paintings (2007\u20132009)\n{{col-end}}\n\nSince 1989 Dokoupil has developed the technique of ''Soot Paintings'', painting projected images with soot of a burning candle or in larger works with the flame of a torch onto a blank canvas hanging flat from the ceiling. The ''Soot Paintings'', often regarded as the most important series within Dokoupils oeuvre, contain different series such as the depictions of art auctions, the ''Subastas''- series, of 1989 or recent ones called ''Leopards''(2000\u20132009) or \"Christ\" paintings depicting Jesus Christ (a reference to his 1986/87 series of the Jesus paintings). For his ''Tire paintings'' of 1991\u20131992, he used freshly colour-dyed rolling tires on predominantly wet, ungrounded canvas. In his ''Soap Bubble Paintings'' of 1992-93 he lets soap-bubbles burst on canvas, while the liquid soap is mixed with colour or ink. In 2003 Dokoupil creates ''Whip Paintings'' by lashing a cowboy whip, which was stuck in a paint pot before, at the canvas. One of Dokoupil\u2018s most recent work is the series of spray-painted ''Buddhas'' on canvas. They are meant to be like [[Buddha]], [[Marilyn Monroe|Marilyn]] and [[Mona Lisa]] all at once, since [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]]\u2018s Marilyn is the Mona Lisa of the 20th century.\n\nEven though a retrospective of his oeuvre would resemble a group show of different painters, it has nothing to do with any pluralism of styles, with the claim of the coincidence of styles, or with a variety of [[post-irony|post-modern irony]]. The focus of his multifaceted oeuvre is in fact on exploring original techniques and configurations generating a domain for playful experimentation and physical tension in which new images can arise and assuring that the act of making images is independent of the iconographic compulsions of the media world today. In that sense Dokoupil could be seen as an \"artist inventor\": inventor of styles and techniques ultimately a clearly conceptual approach.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\nSelected Exhibitions:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*Prague Castle Riding School, Praha, 2010\n*Galerie [[Bruno Bischofberger]] and Galerie Andrea Caratsch, Z\u00fcrich, 2009\n*Ben Brown Fine Arts, London, 2008\n*[[Deichtorhallen]], Hamburg, 2005\n*[[National Gallery in Prague|National Gallery, Praha]], 2005\n*Haus der Kunst, Brno (Czech republic), 2005\n*Centro Atlantico de Arte Moderno CAAM, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 2003\n*Kestner Gesellschaft, Hannover, 2002\n*[[Centraal Museum]], Utrecht, 2002\n*Milton Keynes Gallery, Central Milton Keynes, 2002\n*[[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda]], Madrid, 2002\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]], Chenonceaux, 1999\n*Museum Weimar, Weimar, 1997\n*[[MUMOK|Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig]], Wien, 1997\n*Centre d'Art Contemporain de Fr\u00e9jus, Fr\u00e9jus, 1996\n*[[Tony Shafrazi]] Gallery, New York, 1994\n*Sala Am\u00e1rica, Diputaci\u00f3n Foral de Alava, Vitoria-Gasteiz, 1993\n*Galer\u00eda Juana de Aizpuru, Madrid, 1992\n*Horsens Kunstmuseum, Lund, 1991\n*Kunsthalle Kiel, Kiel, 1991\n*Robert Miller Gallery, New York, 1990\n*Fundaci\u00f3n Caja de Pensiones, Madrid, 1989\n{{col-3}}\n*Galerie Bruno Bischofberger, Z\u00fcrich, 1987\n*Ileana Sonnabend Gallery, New York, 1986\n*[[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, New York, 1985\n*[[Museum Folkwang]], Essen, 1984\n*Kunstmuseum Luzern, Luzern, 1984\n*[[Groninger Museum]], Groningen, 1984\n*Espace Lyonnais d'Art Contemporain, Lyon, 1984\n*Gallery [[Mary Boone]], New York, 1983\n*Galerie Paul Maenz, K\u00f6ln, 1982\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Collections==\n\nSelected Collections:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Van Abbemuseum]], Eindhoven\n* [[Neue Galerie - Sammlung Ludwig]], Aachen\n* [[Groninger Museum]], Groningen\n* Sonnabend Collection, New York\n* [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]]\n* Boymans van Beuningen, Rotterdam\n* [[Kunsthaus Zurich]]\n* Metzger Collection, Museum Folkwang, Essen\n* Neue Galerie, Berlin\n{{col-3}}\n* Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation, Basel\n* Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund\n* Deutsche Bank, Frankfurt\n* The National Museum of Contemporary Art, Seoul\n* Caixa de Pensiones, Barcelona\n* [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris\n* [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda]], Madrid\n* Museo de Bellas Artes de Alava, Vitoria-Gasteiz\n* Kunstmuseum Horsens, Denmark\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg]]\n* Kunsthalle zu Kiel\n* Paul Maenz Collection, Neues Museum Weimer\n* Bischofberger Collection, Zurich\n* [[Migros Museum]], Zurich\n* Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 General Collection, Paris\n* Rubell Family Collection, Miami\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Films==\n\nHe acted in and co produced a few early films of [[Daryush Shokof]] amongst which [[dogs are not allowed]], and [[Ben Hur ,the Breathless,Taxi Driver in Casablanca]] and [[Flushers]] in 2013 in Berlin, Germany.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of German painters]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book | editors=Wilfried Dickhoff, Robert Fleck | title=Dokoupil - Painting in the 21st Century | location=Hamburg | publisher=DUMONT | year=2005}} {{ISBN|3-8321-7553-9}}\n*{{cite book | editors=Carlos Ortega | title=dokoupil | location=Madrid |  publisher=Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda | year=2000}} {{ISBN|84-8003-976-0}}\n*{{cite book | editors=P\u00e9rez Esteban, Jos\u00e9 Antonio | title=Cuadros de humo: una constante esencial en la obra de Jiri Georg Dokoupil | location=M\u00fanich|  publisher=Grin| year=2013}} {{ISBN|978-3-656-49637-3}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.artnet.com/artist/20138/jiri-georg-dokoupil.html Dokoupil at Artnet]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dokoupil}}\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Krnov]]\n[[Category:20th-century German painters]]\n[[Category:German male painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century German painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century Czech painters]]\n", "name_user": "HK Berlin", "label": "safe", "comment": "M\u00fclheimer Freiheit was an artistgroup founded by Dokoupil, Naschberger, dahn, adamski, b\u00f6mmels and Kever in cologne.
