It is situated 6&nbsp;km northwest of [[Ludwigsburg]], 4&nbsp;km south of [[Bietigheim-Bissingen]], and approx. 17&nbsp;km north of [[Stuttgart]]'s city center. At the 2005 Census, the municipality had 12,112 inhabitants.\n\n== History ==\nTamm is one of the older settlements in the area. Its first official mentioning was in 1287. In 1351, the village was gifted to [[Eberhard II, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg]] by ''Katherina von Veihingen'', a member of the [[Pfalzgraf|Counts Palatinate]] of [[T\u00fcbingen]].\n\nIn the 17th century, Tamm was almost completely destroyed during the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the reconstruction of core buildings, such as the central fortified church of [[Saint Bartholomew]], wasn't complete until 25 years after the war's end in 1648.\n\nDuring the 18th century Tamm's inhabitants participated in the construction of the [[W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]]'s new [[Ludwigsburg Palace|residence]] in nearby Ludwigsburg, mostly as [[socage]]rs. In these days, population skyrocketed, from 543 in 1741 to nearly 1000 in 1800. While Tamm was not directly affected by the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it still suffered from the economic strain put on the entire region. Shortly after the war, in 1816, a famine hit, marking a temporary decline in Tamm's development. During the rest of the 19th century, the village grew steadily, getting connected to the railroad in 1877.\n\n[[World War I]] and the economic crisis caused by the defeat and dissolution of the [[German Empire]] again had a negative impact on the village.\n\nIn 1935, two years after the [[Nazi Party]]'s \"[[Machtergreifung]]\", Tamm's liberal acting mayor ''Karl Mammele'' was forced to resign and committed [[suicide]] soon after. While Tamm was target of occasional air raids as soon as [[World War II|1941]], the village didn't see any \"real\" fighting until April 1945, when it was repeatedly shelled during a twelve-day stand-off between [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Free French Forces]] in nearby [[Bietigheim-Bissingen]]. Tamm was captured and occupied by the French Army on April 21, 1945. In July of the same year, the village was transferred to US control, eventually becoming part of the American occupation zone. The post-war years were marked by food and fuel shortages, but Tamm soon recovered and flourished once again, reaching 3900 inhabitants in 1961.\n\nIn the following decades large expansion projects resulted in the creation of the new \"Ortsteil\" ([[suburb]]) ''Hohenstange'', north-east of the old village core, more than doubling Tamm's population (11,500 in 1990). This feat was possible mainly due to Tamm's very attractive position in direct proximity to both the [[Autobahn]] ''A81'' and the railway line between Stuttgart and [[Heilbronn]]. Continuing popularity led to another building phase in the early 21st century, finally connecting the old village (\"Ortsmitte\") with the ''Hohenstange'' borough, which had formerly been divided by a stretch of farmland.\n\nThe presence of well-known corporations (both [[Porsche]] and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] have offices in Tamm), stable middle class enterprises, and a large shopping mall (the ''\"Breuningerland\"'') have made Tamm relatively rich, financing a complete overhaul of the town's railway station, village square, and road system.\n\n== Population ==\nTamm's population was 12,112 at the 2005 census. Considering that, in practice, towns of more than 12,000 inhabitants may apply for city status, the \"Gemeinde Tamm\" may be eligible to become \"Stadt Tamm\" in the future.\n\nDevelopment since 1980 <sup>[http://www.tamm.org/ source]</sup>:\n\n*1980:  8,364\n*1982:  8,873\n*1984:  9,586\n*1986: 10,615\n*1988: 11,261\n*1990: 11,500\n*1992: 11,840\n*1994: 11,731\n*1996: 11,751\n*1998: 11,463\n*2000: 11,455\n*2002: 12,067\n*2004: 12,060\n*2005: 12,112\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Current ===\nThe current mayor of Tamm is '''Martin Bernhard''' (since 2014).\n\nThe municipal council is made up of the following parties:\n\n*AWV (Allgemeine W\u00e4hlervereinigung): 5 seats (24.60%)\n*[[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]: 4 seats (24.41%)\n*[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]: 3 seats (18.69%)\n*LLT (Liste Lebenswertes Tamm e.V.): 3 seats (17.83%)\n*[[Alliance '90/The Greens|B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen]]: 3 seats (14.48%)\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe [[Coat of Arms]] of Tamm shows a ''[[Bend (heraldry)|bend sinister]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]]'', representing a [[dam]] (''ger.: Damm'', hence the name \"Tamm\") on a red ''[[Field (heraldry)|field]]'', with a golden [[plough]], representing agriculture and tradition, in the upper left, and a golden [[Gear|gear wheel]], representing industry and progress, in the lower right partition.\n\n=== Twin town ===\nTamm is currently [[Town twinning|twinned]] with [[Althofen]], [[K\u00e4rnten]], [[Austria]].\n\n== Traffic and transportation ==\n[[Image:Hohenstange sbahn.jpg|thumb|Stuttgart S-Bahn train in Tamm]]\nTamm lies directly adjacent to both [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 27|federal highway B 27]] and [[Bundesautobahn 81|autobahn A 81]] (Exit ''Ludwigsburg-Nord''), both running between Stuttgart and [[Heilbronn]].

The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies. Fledgling birds have undefined, fluffy light grey chests without scalloping.

The white-rump is clearly visible as yellow-throated miners are flying away, so this feature is often used in the field where two miner species overlap.  Yellow-throated miners have a varying amount of yellow highlighting above and below the beak on the forehead and chin, as well as on the sides of the throat. This differs from noisy miners which have white above the beak and no yellow highlighting on the  forehead or neck, but can have a small amount of yellow on the chin. Yellow-throated miners have paler feathering on the lower jaw compared to the throat, while pure black-eared miners have darker feathering on the lower jaw compared to that of the throat.
