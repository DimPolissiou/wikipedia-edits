{"title_page": "Civil defense in Russia", "text_new": "'''Civil defense in Russia''' is the system of measures to protect people and material assets in the the Russian Federation in the event of hostilities, natural disasters or technological disasters, as well as the preparation of such measures These measures include sheltering, evacuation, disguising facilities, first aid and basic residents.\n\nThe procedure for organizing civil defense is enshrined in the [[Law of the Russian Federation|federal laws]] \u201c''On Civil Defense''\u201d (1998), \u201c''On Protection against Emergencies of Natural and Technogenic Character''\u201d (1994) and \u201c''On Emergency and Rescue Services''\u201d (1995).\n\n==History==\nFor the first time, civil defense events in Russia began to be held during the First World War. The advent of aviation and chemical weapons contributed to striking economic and infrastructure facilities located behind enemy lines. Often, the bombing of cities was carried out in order to intimidate and demoralize the population. Therefore, the military command of the army and authorities began to develop and carry out measures to protect the population from the dangers arising from the conduct of hostilities.

A person can have dysphagia without odynophagia (dysfunction without pain), odynophagia without dysphagia (pain without dysfunction) or both together. A [[psychogenic disease|psychogenic]] dysphagia is known as [[phagophobia]].\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSome patients have limited awareness of their dysphagia, so lack of the symptom does not exclude an underlying disease.<ref name=\"Logemann\" /> When dysphagia goes undiagnosed or untreated, patients are at a high risk of [[pulmonary aspiration]] and subsequent [[aspiration pneumonia]] secondary to food or liquids going the wrong way into the lungs. Some people present with \"silent aspiration\" and do not cough or show outward signs of aspiration. Undiagnosed dysphagia can also result in dehydration, malnutrition, and [[kidney failure]].\n\nSome signs and symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia include difficulty controlling food in the mouth, inability to control food or saliva in the mouth, difficulty initiating a swallow, coughing, choking, frequent [[pneumonia]], unexplained weight loss, gurgly or wet voice after swallowing, nasal regurgitation, and dysphagia (patient complaint of swallowing difficulty).<ref name=\"Logemann\">{{cite book |author=Logemann, Jeri A. |title=Evaluation and treatment of swallowing disorders |publisher=Pro-Ed |location=Austin, Tex |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=978-0-89079-728-0 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> When asked where the food is getting stuck, patients will often point to the cervical ([[neck]]) region as the site of the obstruction. The actual site of obstruction is always at or below the level at which the level of obstruction is perceived.\n\nThe most common symptom of esophageal dysphagia is the inability to swallow solid food, which the patient will describe as 'becoming stuck' or 'held up' before it either passes into the stomach or is regurgitated. Pain on swallowing or [[odynophagia]] is a distinctive symptom that can be highly indicative of [[carcinoma]], although it also has numerous other causes that are not related to cancer.\n\n[[Achalasia]] is a major exception to usual pattern of dysphagia in that swallowing of fluid tends to cause more difficulty than swallowing solids. In achalasia, there is idiopathic destruction of parasympathetic ganglia of the [[Myenteric plexus|Auerbach's (Myenteric) plexus]] of the entire esophagus, which results in functional narrowing of the lower [[esophagus]], and peristaltic failure throughout its length.\n===Complications===\nComplications of dysphagia may include [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]], [[pneumonia]], [[dehydration]], and weight loss.\n\n==Classification and cause==\nDysphagia is classified into the following major types:<ref name=\"Spieker2000-AmFamPhysician\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Spieker MR | title = Evaluating dysphagia | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 61 | issue = 12 | pages = 3639\u201348 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10892635 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0615/p3639.html }}</ref>\n# [[Oropharyngeal dysphagia]]\n# [[Esophageal dysphagia|Esophageal and obstructive dysphagia]]\n# Neuromuscular symptom complexes\n# Functional dysphagia is defined in some patients as having no organic cause for dysphagia that can be found.\n\nFollowing table enumerates possible causes of dysphagia:\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!Location!!

Treatment for dysphagia is managed by a group of specialists known as a multidisciplinary team. Members of the multidisciplinary team include: a speech language pathologist specializing in swallowing disorders (swallowing therapist), primary physician, gastroenterologist, nursing staff, respiratory therapist, dietitian, occupational therapist, physical therapist, pharmacist, and radiologist.<ref name=\"Logemann\" /> The role of the members of the multidisciplinary team will differ depending on the type of swallowing disorder present. For example, the swallowing therapist will be directly involved in the treatment of a patient with [[oropharyngeal dysphagia]], while a gastroenterologist will be directly involved in the treatment of an esophageal disorder.\n\n=== Treatment strategies ===\nThe implementation of a treatment strategy should be based on a thorough evaluation by the multidisciplinary team. Treatment strategies will differ on a patient to patient basis and should be structured to meet the specific needs of each individual patient. Treatment strategies are chosen based on a number of different factors including diagnosis, prognosis, reaction to compensatory strategies, severity of dysphagia, cognitive status, respiratory function, caregiver support, and patient motivation and interest.<ref name=\"Logemann\" /> \n\n==== Oral vs. nonoral feeding ====\nAdequate nutrition and hydration must be preserved at all times during dysphagia treatment. The overall goal of dysphagia therapy is to maintain, or return the patient to, oral feeding. However, this must be done while ensuring adequate nutrition and hydration and a safe swallow (no aspiration of food into the lungs).<ref name=\"Logemann\" /> If oral feeding results in increased mealtimes and increased effort during the swallow, resulting in not enough food being ingested to maintain weight, a supplementary nonoral feeding method of nutrition may be needed. In addition, if the patient aspirates food or liquid into the lungs despite the use of compensatory strategies, and is therefore unsafe for oral feeding, nonoral feeding may be needed. Nonoral feeding includes receiving nutrition through a method that bypasses the oropharyngeal swallowing mechanism including a nasogastric tube, gastrostomy, or jejunostomy.<ref name=\"Logemann\" />\n\n==== Treatment procedures ====\nCompensatory Treatment Procedures are designed to change the flow of the food/liquids and eliminate symptoms, but do not directly change the physiology of the swallow.<ref name=\"Logemann\" />\n* Postural Techniques\n\n* Food Consistency (Diet) Changes\n\n* Modifying Volume and Speed of Food Presentation\n\n* Technique to Improve Oral Sensory Awareness\n* Intraoral Prosthetics\nTherapeutic Treatment Procedures - designed to change and/or improve the physiology of the swallow.<ref name=\"Logemann\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perry|first=Alison|last2=Lee|first2=Siew Hwa|last3=Cotton|first3=Susan|last4=Kennedy|first4=Catriona|date=2016-08-26|editor-last=Cochrane ENT Group|title=Therapeutic exercises for affecting post-treatment swallowing in people treated for advanced-stage head and neck cancers|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/14651858.CD011112.pub2|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011112.pub2|hdl=10059/1671|hdl-access=free}}</ref>\n\n* Oral and Pharyngeal Range-of-Motion Exercises\n\n* Resistance Exercises\n\n* Bolus Control Exercises\n\n* Swallowing Maneuvers\n** Supraglottic swallow\n** Super-supraglottic swallow\n** Effortful swallow\n** Mendelsohn maneuver\n\nPatients may need a combination of treatment procedures to maintain a safe and nutritionally adequate swallow.

The actual site of obstruction is always at or below the level at which the level of obstruction is perceived.\n\nThe most common symptom of esophageal dysphagia is the inability to swallow solid food, which the patient will describe as 'becoming stuck' or 'held up' before it either passes into the stomach or is regurgitated. Pain on swallowing or [[odynophagia]] is a distinctive symptom that can be highly indicative of [[carcinoma]], although it also has numerous other causes that are not related to cancer.\n\n[[Achalasia]] is a major exception to usual pattern of dysphagia in that swallowing of fluid tends to cause more difficulty than swallowing solids. In achalasia, there is idiopathic destruction of parasympathetic ganglia of the [[Myenteric plexus|Auerbach's (Myenteric) plexus]] of the entire esophagus, which results in functional narrowing of the lower [[esophagus]], and peristaltic failure throughout its length.\n===Complications===\nComplications of dysphagia may include [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]], [[pneumonia]], [[dehydration]], and weight loss.\n\n==Classification and cause==\nDysphagia is classified into the following major types:<ref name=\"Spieker2000-AmFamPhysician\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Spieker MR | title = Evaluating dysphagia | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 61 | issue = 12 | pages = 3639\u201348 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10892635 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0615/p3639.html }}</ref>\n# [[Oropharyngeal dysphagia]]\n# [[Esophageal dysphagia|Esophageal and obstructive dysphagia]]\n# Neuromuscular symptom complexes\n# Functional dysphagia is defined in some patients as having no organic cause for dysphagia that can be found.\n\nFollowing table enumerates possible causes of dysphagia:\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!Location!!

Patients with difficulty swallowing may benefit from [[thickened fluids]] if the person is more comfortable with those liquids, although, so far, there are no scientific study that proves that those thickened liquids are beneficial.\n\nDysphagia may manifest as the result of [[autonomic nervous system]] pathologies including [[stroke]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Edmiaston J, Connor LT, Loehr L, Nassief A | title = Validation of a dysphagia screening tool in acute stroke patients | journal = American Journal of Critical Care | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 357\u201364 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 19875722 | pmc = 2896456 | doi = 10.4037/ajcc2009961 }}</ref> and [[ALS]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Noh EJ, Park MI, Park SJ, Moon W, Jung HJ | title = A case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis presented as oropharyngeal Dysphagia | journal = Journal of Neurogastroenterology and Motility | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 319\u201322 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20680172 | pmc = 2912126 | doi = 10.5056/jnm.2010.16.3.319 }}</ref> or due to rapid iatrogenic correction of an electrolyte imbalance.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin RJ | title = Central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis: the osmotic demyelination syndromes | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 75 Suppl 3 | pages = iii22\u201328 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15316041 | pmc = 1765665 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.2004.045906 }}</ref>\n\n== Treatments ==\nThere are many ways to treat dysphagia, such as swallowing therapy, dietary changes, feeding tubes, certain medications, and surgery. Treatment for dysphagia is managed by a group of specialists known as a multidisciplinary team. Members of the multidisciplinary team include: a speech language pathologist specializing in swallowing disorders (swallowing therapist), primary physician, gastroenterologist, nursing staff, respiratory therapist, dietitian, occupational therapist, physical therapist, pharmacist, and radiologist.<ref name=\"Logemann\" /> The role of the members of the multidisciplinary team will differ depending on the type of swallowing disorder present. For example, the swallowing therapist will be directly involved in the treatment of a patient with [[oropharyngeal dysphagia]], while a gastroenterologist will be directly involved in the treatment of an esophageal disorder.\n\n=== Treatment strategies ===\nThe implementation of a treatment strategy should be based on a thorough evaluation by the multidisciplinary team. Treatment strategies will differ on a patient to patient basis and should be structured to meet the specific needs of each individual patient. Treatment strategies are chosen based on a number of different factors including diagnosis, prognosis, reaction to compensatory strategies, severity of dysphagia, cognitive status, respiratory function, caregiver support, and patient motivation and interest.<ref name=\"Logemann\" /> \n\n==== Oral vs. nonoral feeding ====\nAdequate nutrition and hydration must be preserved at all times during dysphagia treatment. The overall goal of dysphagia therapy is to maintain, or return the patient to, oral feeding. However, this must be done while ensuring adequate nutrition and hydration and a safe swallow (no aspiration of food into the lungs).<ref name=\"Logemann\" /> If oral feeding results in increased mealtimes and increased effort during the swallow, resulting in not enough food being ingested to maintain weight, a supplementary nonoral feeding method of nutrition may be needed. In addition, if the patient aspirates food or liquid into the lungs despite the use of compensatory strategies, and is therefore unsafe for oral feeding, nonoral feeding may be needed. Nonoral feeding includes receiving nutrition through a method that bypasses the oropharyngeal swallowing mechanism including a nasogastric tube, gastrostomy, or jejunostomy.<ref name=\"Logemann\" />\n\n==== Treatment procedures ====\nCompensatory Treatment Procedures are designed to change the flow of the food/liquids and eliminate symptoms, but do not directly change the physiology of the swallow.<ref name=\"Logemann\" />\n* Postural Techniques\n\n* Food Consistency (Diet) Changes\n\n* Modifying Volume and Speed of Food Presentation\n\n* Technique to Improve Oral Sensory Awareness\n* Intraoral Prosthetics\nTherapeutic Treatment Procedures - designed to change and/or improve the physiology of the swallow.<ref name=\"Logemann\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perry|first=Alison|last2=Lee|first2=Siew Hwa|last3=Cotton|first3=Susan|last4=Kennedy|first4=Catriona|date=2016-08-26|editor-last=Cochrane ENT Group|title=Therapeutic exercises for affecting post-treatment swallowing in people treated for advanced-stage head and neck cancers|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/14651858.CD011112.pub2|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011112.pub2|hdl=10059/1671|hdl-access=free}}</ref>\n\n* Oral and Pharyngeal Range-of-Motion Exercises\n\n* Resistance Exercises\n\n* Bolus Control Exercises\n\n* Swallowing Maneuvers\n** Supraglottic swallow\n** Super-supraglottic swallow\n** Effortful swallow\n** Mendelsohn maneuver\n\nPatients may need a combination of treatment procedures to maintain a safe and nutritionally adequate swallow. For example, postural strategies may be combined with swallowing maneuvers to allow the patient to swallow in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe most common interventions used for those with oropharyngeal dysphagia by speech language pathologists are texture modification of foods, thickening fluids and positioning changes during swallowing.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McCurtin A, Healy C | title = Why do clinicians choose the therapies and techniques they do?

Cohn ordered extensive editing and re-shoots. After heavy editing by the studio, approximately one hour of Welles's first cut was removed, including much of a climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse. While expressing displeasure at the cuts, Welles was appalled particularly with the musical score. The film was considered a disaster in America at the time of release, though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors has since become a touchstone of [[film noir]]. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce.\n\nAlthough ''The Lady From Shanghai'' was acclaimed in Europe, it was not embraced in the U.S. until decades later, where it is now often regarded as a classic of film noir.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-lady-from-shanghai/Film?oid=2552830|title=The Lady From Shanghai|last=Kehr|first=Dave|website=Chicago Reader|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}</ref> A similar difference in reception on opposite sides of the Atlantic, followed by greater American acceptance, befell the Welles-inspired Chaplin film ''Monsieur Verdoux'', originally to be directed by Welles starring Chaplin, then directed by Chaplin with the idea credited to Welles.\n\n=== ''Macbeth'' ===\n{{Main|Macbeth (1948 film)}}\nPrior to 1948, Welles convinced [[Republic Pictures]] to let him direct a [[Macbeth (1948 film)|low-budget version]] of ''[[Macbeth]]'', which featured highly stylized sets and costumes, and a cast of actors lip-syncing to a pre-recorded soundtrack, one of many innovative cost-cutting techniques Welles deployed in an attempt to make an epic film from [[B-movie]] resources. The script, adapted by Welles, is a violent reworking of Shakespeare's original, freely cutting and pasting lines into new contexts via a [[collage]] technique and recasting ''Macbeth'' as a clash of pagan and proto-Christian ideologies. Some voodoo trappings of the famous Welles/Houseman Negro Theatre stage adaptation are visible, especially in the film's characterization of the [[Weird Sisters]], who create an effigy of Macbeth as a charm to enchant him. Of all Welles's post-''Kane'' Hollywood productions, ''Macbeth'' is stylistically closest to ''Citizen Kane'' in its long takes and deep focus photography.\n\nRepublic initially trumpeted the film as an important work but decided it did not care for the Scottish accents and held up general release for almost a year after early negative press reaction, including ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''{{'}}s comment that Welles's film \"doth foully slaughter Shakespeare.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Orson Welles doth foully slaughter Shakespeare in a dialect version of his \"Tragedy of Macbeth\" \u2014 or so sayeth LIFE magazine|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=729|work=Wellesnet|access-date=September 1, 2011|date=2009-06-19}}</ref> Welles left for Europe, while co-producer and lifelong supporter [[Richard Wilson (producer)|Richard Wilson]] reworked the soundtrack. Welles returned and cut 20 minutes from the film at Republic's request and recorded narration to cover some gaps. The film was decried as a disaster. ''Macbeth'' had influential fans in Europe, especially the French poet and filmmaker [[Jean Cocteau]], who hailed the film's \"crude, irreverent power\" and careful shot design, and described the characters as haunting \"the corridors of some dreamlike subway, an abandoned coal mine, and ruined cellars oozing with water.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Tony|title=Macbeth|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2006/cteq/macbeth-2/|work=[[Senses of Cinema]]|access-date=September 1, 2011|date=2006-02-06}}</ref>\n\n== Europe (1948\u20131956) ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nIn Italy he starred as [[Cagliostro]] in the 1948 film ''[[Black Magic (1949 film)|Black Magic]]''. His co-star, [[Akim Tamiroff]], impressed Welles so much that Tamiroff would appear in four of Welles's productions during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe following year, Welles starred as [[Harry Lime]] in [[Carol Reed]]'s ''[[The Third Man]]'', alongside [[Joseph Cotten]], his friend and co-star from ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', with a script by [[Graham Greene]] and a memorable score by [[Anton Karas]].\n\nA few years later, British radio producer [[Harry Alan Towers]] would resurrect the Lime character in the radio series ''[[The Adventures of Harry Lime]]''.\n\nWelles appeared as [[Cesare Borgia]] in the 1949 Italian film ''[[Prince of Foxes (film)|Prince of Foxes]]'', with [[Tyrone Power]] and Mercury Theatre alumnus [[Everett Sloane]], and as the Mongol warrior Bayan in the 1950 film version of the novel ''[[The Black Rose]]'' (again with Tyrone Power).\n<ref>Carol Reed biography</ref>\n\n=== ''Othello'' ===\n{{Main|Othello (1951 film)}}\n[[File:Othello-Welles-Cloutier.jpg|thumb|upright|Welles and [[Suzanne Cloutier]] in ''[[Othello (1951 film)|Othello]]'' (1951)]]\n\nDuring this time, Welles was channeling his money from acting jobs into a self-financed film version of Shakespeare's play ''[[Othello]]''. From 1949 to 1951, Welles worked on ''[[Othello (1951 film)|Othello]]'', filming on location in [[Italy]] and [[Morocco]]. The film featured Welles's friends, [[Miche\u00e1l Mac Liamm\u00f3ir]] as [[Iago]] and [[Hilton Edwards]] as [[Desdemona (Othello)|Desdemona]]'s father [[Brabantio]]. [[Suzanne Cloutier]] starred as Desdemona and [[The Campbell Playhouse (TV series)|Campbell Playhouse]] alumnus [[Robert Coote]] appeared as Iago's associate Roderigo.\n\nFilming was suspended several times as Welles ran out of funds and left for acting jobs, accounted in detail in MacLiamm\u00f3ir's published memoir ''Put Money in Thy Purse''. The American release prints had a technically flawed soundtrack, suffering from a dropout of sound at every quiet moment. Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles-Smith, restored ''Othello'' in 1992 for a wide re-release. The restoration included reconstructing [[Angelo Francesco Lavagnino]]'s original musical score, which was originally inaudible, and adding ambient stereo sound effects, which were not in the original film. The restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America.\n\nIn 1952, Welles continued finding work in England after the success of the ''Harry Lime'' radio show. Harry Alan Towers offered Welles another series, ''[[The Black Museum]]'', which ran for 52 weeks with Welles as host and narrator. Director Herbert Wilcox offered Welles the part of the murdered victim in ''[[Trent's Last Case (1952 film)|Trent's Last Case]]'', based on the novel by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|E. C. Bentley]]. In 1953, the [[BBC]] hired Welles to read an hour of selections from [[Walt Whitman]]'s epic poem ''[[Song of Myself]]''. Towers hired Welles again, to play [[Professor Moriarty]] in the radio series, ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'', starring [[John Gielgud]] and [[Ralph Richardson]].\n\nWelles briefly returned to America to make his first appearance on television, starring in the ''[[Omnibus (US TV series)|Omnibus]]'' presentation of ''[[King Lear (1953 TV drama)|King Lear]]'', broadcast live on [[CBS]] October 18, 1953. Directed by [[Peter Brook]], the production costarred [[Natasha Parry]], [[Beatrice Straight]] and [[Arnold Moss]].<ref>[https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/40866/king-lear/ DVD Talk review] February 9, 2010 (Retrieved December 29, 2011)</ref>\n\nIn 1954, director George More O'Ferrall offered Welles the title role in the 'Lord Mountdrago' segment of ''[[Three Cases of Murder]]'', co-starring [[Alan Badel]]. [[Herbert Wilcox]] cast Welles as the antagonist in ''[[Trouble in the Glen]]'' opposite [[Margaret Lockwood]], [[Forrest Tucker]] and [[Victor McLaglen]]. Old friend [[John Huston]] cast him as Father Mapple in his [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|1956 film adaptation]] of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', starring [[Gregory Peck]].\n\n=== ''Mr. Arkadin'' ===\n{{Main|Mr. Arkadin}}\n[[File:Orson Welles.jpg|thumb|upright|Welles in Madrid during the filming of ''Mr. Arkadin'' in 1954]]\nWelles's next turn as director was the film ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]'' (1955), which was produced by his political mentor from the 1940s, [[Louis Dolivet]]. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to delve into the secrets of his past. The film stars [[Robert Arden]], who had worked on the Harry Lime series; Welles's third wife, [[Paola Mori]], whose voice was dubbed by actress [[Billie Whitelaw]]; and guest stars [[Akim Tamiroff]], [[Michael Redgrave]], [[Katina Paxinou]] and [[Mischa Auer]]. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually five different versions of the film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version that Dolivet completed was retitled ''Confidential Report''. In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the [[Munich Film Museum]] oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements.\n\n=== Television projects ===\nIn 1955, Welles also directed two television series for the BBC. The first was ''[[Orson Welles' Sketch Book]]'', a series of six 15-minute shows featuring Welles drawing in a sketchbook to illustrate his reminiscences for the camera (including such topics as the filming of ''It's All True'' and the Isaac Woodard case), and the second was ''[[Around the World with Orson Welles]]'', a series of six travelogues set in different locations around Europe (such as [[Vienna]], the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] between France and Spain, and England). Welles served as host and interviewer, his commentary including documentary facts and his own personal observations (a technique he would continue to explore in later works).\n\nIn 1956, Welles completed ''[[Portrait of Gina]]''. The film cans would remain in a lost-and-found locker at the hotel for several decades, where they were discovered after Welles's death.\n\n== Return to Hollywood (1956\u20131959) ==\n[[File:Lucille Ball Orson Welles I Love Lucy 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|Welles the magician with Lucille Ball in ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' (October 15, 1956)]]\nIn 1956, Welles returned to Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theibtaurisblog.com/2012/08/30/orson-welles-and-pan-europeanism-1947-1970/ |title=Orson Welles and pan-Europeanism 1957\u20131970 |last=Thevoz |first=Seth |publisher=I.B.

Originally only hired as an actor, Welles was promoted to director by [[Universal Studios]] at the insistence of Charlton Heston.<ref name=\"Heston\">[[Charlton Heston|Heston, Charlton]], ''In the Arena: An Autobiography''.

Filming proceeded smoothly, with Welles finishing on schedule and on budget, and the studio bosses praising the daily rushes. Nevertheless, after the end of production, the studio re-edited the film, re-shot scenes, and shot new exposition scenes to clarify the plot.<ref name=\"Heston\" />{{Rp|175\u2013176|date=April 2014}} Welles wrote a 58-page memo outlining suggestions and objections, stating that the film was no longer his version\u2014it was the studio's, but as such, he was still prepared to help with it.<ref name=\"Heston\" />{{Rp|175\u2013176|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn 1978, a longer preview version of the film was discovered and released.\n\nAs Universal reworked ''Touch of Evil'', Welles began filming his adaptation of [[Miguel de Cervantes]]'s novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'' in Mexico, starring [[Mischa Auer]] as Quixote and Akim Tamiroff as [[Sancho Panza]].\n\n== Return to Europe (1959\u20131970) ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Orson Welles - 1960.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Welles in ''[[Crack in the Mirror]]'' (1960)]]\nHe continued shooting ''Don Quixote'' in Spain and Italy, but replaced Mischa Auer with Francisco Reiguera, and resumed acting jobs.\nIn Italy in 1959, Welles directed his own scenes as [[King Saul]] in Richard Pottier's film ''David and Goliath''. In Hong Kong he co-starred with [[Curt J\u00fcrgens]] in [[Lewis Gilbert]]'s film ''[[Ferry to Hong Kong]]''. In 1960, in Paris he co-starred in [[Richard Fleischer]]'s film ''[[Crack in the Mirror]]''. In [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] he starred in [[Richard Thorpe]]'s film ''[[The Tartars]]'' and [[Veljko Bulaji\u0107]]'s ''[[Battle of Neretva (film)|Battle of Neretva]]''.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, filming continued on ''Quixote'' on-and-off until the end of the decade, as Welles evolved the concept, tone and ending several times. Although he had a complete version of the film shot and edited at least once, he would continue toying with the editing well into the 1980s, he never completed a version film he was fully satisfied with, and would junk existing footage and shoot new footage. (In one case, he had a complete cut ready in which Quixote and Sancho Panza end up going to the moon, but he felt the ending was rendered obsolete by the 1969 moon landings, and burned 10 reels of this version.) As the process went on, Welles gradually voiced all of the characters himself and provided narration. In 1992, the director [[Jes\u00fas Franco]] constructed a film out of the portions of ''Quixote'' left behind by Welles. Some of the film stock had decayed badly. While the Welles footage was greeted with interest, the post-production by Franco was met with harsh criticism.\n\nIn 1961, Welles directed ''In the Land of Don Quixote'', a series of eight half-hour episodes for the Italian television network [[RAI]]. Similar to the ''Around the World with Orson Welles'' series, they presented travelogues of Spain and included Welles's wife, Paola, and their daughter, Beatrice. Though Welles was fluent in Italian, the network was not interested in him providing Italian narration because of his accent, and the series sat unreleased until 1964, by which time the network had added Italian narration of its own. Ultimately, versions of the episodes were released with the original musical score Welles had approved, but without the narration.\n\n=== ''The Trial'' ===\n{{Main|The Trial (1962 film)}}\nIn 1962, Welles directed his adaptation of ''[[The Trial (1962 film)|The Trial]]'', based on [[The Trial|the novel]] by [[Franz Kafka]] and produced by Michael and [[Alexander Salkind]]. The cast included [[Anthony Perkins]] as Josef K, [[Jeanne Moreau]], [[Romy Schneider]], [[Paola Mori]] and [[Akim Tamiroff]]. While filming exteriors in [[Zagreb]], Welles was informed that the Salkinds had run out of money, meaning that there could be no set construction. No stranger to shooting on found locations, Welles soon filmed the interiors in the [[Gare d'Orsay]], at that time an abandoned railway station in Paris. Welles thought the location possessed a \"[[Jules Verne]] modernism\" and a melancholy sense of \"waiting\", both suitable for Kafka. To remain in the spirit of Kafka Welles set up the cutting room together with the Film Editor, Frederick Muller (as Fritz Muller), in the old un-used, cold, depressing, station master office. The film failed at the box-office. [[Peter Bogdanovich]] would later observe that Welles found the film riotously funny. Welles also told a BBC interviewer that it was his best film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/trial%20bbc%20interview.htm |title=Welles BBC interview |publisher=Wellesnet.com |access-date=March 30, 2010}}</ref> While filming ''The Trial'' Welles met [[Oja Kodar]], who later became his mistress and collaborator for the last 20 years of his life.<ref name=\"Welles TIOW\" />{{Rp|428}}\n\nWelles played a film director in ''[[La Ricotta]]'' (1963), [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s segment of the ''[[Ro.Go.Pa.G.]]'' movie, although his renowned voice was dubbed by Italian writer Giorgio Bassani.<ref name=\"Welles TIOW\" />{{Rp|516|date=May 2012}} He continued taking what work he could find acting, narrating or hosting other people's work, and began filming ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'', which was completed in 1965.\n\n=== ''Chimes at Midnight'' ===\n{{Main|Chimes at Midnight}}\n[[File:Orson-Welles-Falstaff.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'' (1965)]]\nFilmed in Spain, ''Chimes at Midnight'' was based on Welles's play, ''[[Chimes at Midnight#Five Kings (1939)|Five Kings]]'', in which he drew material from six Shakespeare plays to tell the story of [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]] (Welles) and his relationship with [[Henry V of England|Prince Hal]] ([[Keith Baxter (actor)|Keith Baxter]]).

Released in 1968, it stars Jeanne Moreau, [[Roger Coggio]] and [[Norman Eshley]]. The film had a successful run in French theaters. At this time Welles met Oja Kodar again, and gave her a letter he had written to her and had been keeping for four years; they would not be parted again. They immediately began a collaboration both personal and professional. The first of these was an adaptation of Blixen's ''The Heroine'', meant to be a companion piece to ''The Immortal Story'' and starring Kodar. Unfortunately, funding disappeared after one day's shooting. After completing this film, he appeared in a brief cameo as [[Cardinal Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] in [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s adaptation of ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]''\u2014a role for which he won considerable acclaim.\n\n[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Sergei Bondarchuk and Orson Welles, Sarajevo, 29. november 1969.

The cast included Jeanne Moreau, [[Laurence Harvey]] and Kodar. Personally financed by Welles and Kodar, they could not obtain the funds to complete the project, and it was abandoned a few years later after the death of Harvey. The surviving footage was eventually edited and released by the Filmmuseum M\u00fcnchen. In 1968 Welles began filming a TV special for CBS under the title ''Orson's Bag'', combining travelogue, comedy skits and a condensation of Shakespeare's play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' with Welles as [[Shylock]]. In 1969 Welles called again the Film Editor Frederick Muller to work with him re-editing the material and they set up cutting rooms at the Safa Palatino Studios in Rome. Funding for the show sent by CBS to Welles in Switzerland was seized by the IRS. Without funding, the show was not completed. The surviving [[The Merchant of Venice (unfinished film)|film]] clips portions were eventually released by the Filmmuseum M\u00fcnchen.\n\nIn 1969, Welles authorized the use of his name for a cinema in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The [[Orson Welles Cinema]] remained in operation until 1986, with Welles making a personal appearance there in 1977. Also in 1969 he played a supporting role in [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Kremlin Letter]]''. Drawn by the numerous offers he received to work in television and films, and upset by a tabloid scandal reporting his affair with Kodar, Welles abandoned the editing of ''Don Quixote'' and moved back to America in 1970.\n\n== Later career (1970\u20131985) ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nWelles returned to Hollywood, where he continued to self-finance his film and television projects. While offers to act, narrate and host continued, Welles also found himself in great demand on television talk shows. He made frequent appearances for [[The Dick Cavett Show|Dick Cavett]], [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Johnny Carson]], [[The Dean Martin Show|Dean Martin]] and [[The Merv Griffin Show|Merv Griffin]].\n\nWelles's primary focus during his final years was ''[[The Other Side of the Wind]]'', a project that was filmed intermittently between 1970 and 1976. Co-written by Welles and Oja Kodar, it is the story of an aging film director ([[John Huston]]) looking for funds to complete his final film. The cast includes [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Susan Strasberg]], [[Norman Foster (director)|Norman Foster]], [[Edmond O'Brien]], [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] and [[Dennis Hopper]]. Financed by Iranian backers, ownership of the film fell into a legal quagmire after the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] was deposed.

Never completed, it was eventually released by the Filmmuseum M\u00fcnchen. He also appeared in ''[[Ten Days' Wonder (film)|Ten Days' Wonder]]'', co-starring with [[Anthony Perkins]] and directed by [[Claude Chabrol]], based on a detective novel by [[Ellery Queen]]. That same year, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] gave him an honorary award \"For superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures\". Welles pretended to be out of town and sent [[John Huston]] to claim the award, thanking the Academy on film. Huston criticized the Academy for awarding Welles, even while they refused to give Welles any work.\n\nIn 1972, Welles acted as on-screen narrator for the film documentary version of [[Alvin Toffler]]'s 1970 book ''[[Future Shock]]''. Working again for a British producer, Welles played [[Long John Silver]] in director [[John Hough (director)|John Hough]]'s ''[[Treasure Island (1972 live-action film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1972), an adaptation of the [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] novel, which had been the second story broadcast by ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'' in 1938. This was the last time he played the lead role in a major film. Welles also contributed to the script, his writing credit was attributed to the pseudonym 'O. W. Jeeves'. In some versions of the film Welles's original recorded dialog was redubbed by [[Robert Rietty]].\n[[File:F-for-Fake.jpg|thumb|Orson Welles in ''[[F for Fake]]'' (1974), a [[film essay]] and the last film he completed.]]\nIn 1973, Welles completed ''[[F for Fake]]'', a personal essay film about art forger [[Elmyr de Hory]] and the biographer [[Clifford Irving]]. Based on an existing documentary by [[Fran\u00e7ois Reichenbach]], it included new material with Oja Kodar, Joseph Cotten, [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]] and [[William Alland]]. An excerpt of Welles's 1930s ''War of the Worlds'' broadcast was recreated for this film; however, none of the dialogue heard in the film actually matches what was originally broadcast. Welles filmed a five-minute trailer, rejected in the U.S., that featured several shots of a topless Kodar.\n\nWelles hosted a British syndicated anthology series, ''[[Orson Welles' Great Mysteries|Orson Welles's Great Mysteries]]'', during the 1973\u201374 television season. His brief introductions to the 26 half-hour episodes were shot in July 1973 by Gary Graver.<ref name=\"Welles TIOW\" />{{Rp|443}} The year 1974 also saw Welles lending his voice for that year's remake of [[Agatha Christie]]'s classic thriller ''[[And Then There Were None (1974 film)|Ten Little Indians]]'' produced by his former associate, Harry Alan Towers and starring an international cast that included [[Oliver Reed]], [[Elke Sommer]] and [[Herbert Lom]].\n\nIn 1975, Welles narrated the documentary ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]'', focusing on [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons from the 1940s. Also in 1975, the [[American Film Institute]] presented Welles with its third Lifetime Achievement Award (the first two going to director [[John Ford]] and actor [[James Cagney]]).

He also did commercials for the Preview Subscription Television Service seen on stations around the country including WCLQ/Cleveland, KNDL/St. Louis and WSMW/Boston.

In 1982, the BBC broadcast ''The Orson Welles Story'' in the ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' series. Interviewed by Leslie Megahey, Welles examined his past in great detail, and several people from his professional past were interviewed as well. It was reissued in 1990 as ''With Orson Welles: Stories of a Life in Film''. Welles provided narration for the tracks \"Defender\" from [[Manowar]]'s 1987 album ''[[Fighting the World]]'' and \"Dark Avenger\" on their 1982 album, ''[[Battle Hymns (Manowar album)|Battle Hymns]]''.

Another project he worked on was ''[[Filming The Trial]]'', the second in a proposed series of documentaries examining his feature films. While much was shot for these projects, none of them was completed. All of them were eventually released by the Filmmuseum M\u00fcnchen.\n\nIn 1984, Welles narrated the short-lived television series ''[[Scene of the Crime (1984 TV series)|Scene of the Crime]]''. During the early years of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', Welles was the voice of the unseen character Robin Masters, a famous writer and [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]]. Welles's death forced this minor character to largely be written out of the series. In an oblique homage to Welles, the ''Magnum, P.I.'' producers ambiguously concluded that story arc by having one character accuse another of having hired an actor to portray Robin Masters.<ref>''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', episode \"Paper War\", 1986</ref> He also, in this penultimate year released a music single, titled \"I Know What It Is To Be Young (But You Don't Know What It Is To Be Old)\", which he recorded under Italian label [[Compagnia Generale del Disco]].

His last film appearance was in [[Henry Jaglom]]'s 1987 independent film ''[[Someone to Love (1987 film)|Someone to Love]]'', released two years after his death but produced before his voice-over in ''Transformers: The Movie''. His last television appearance was on the television show ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. He recorded an introduction to an episode entitled \"The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice\", which was partially filmed in black and white. The episode aired five days after his death and was dedicated to his memory.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Henry Jaglom taped lunch conversations with Welles at Los Angeles's Ma Maison as well as in New York.

Welles financed his later projects through his own fundraising activities. He often also took on other work to obtain money to fund his own films.\n\n=== ''Don Quixote'' ===\n{{Main|Don Quixote (unfinished film)}}\nIn the mid-1950s, Welles began work on ''Don Quixote'', initially a commission from [[CBS]] television. Welles expanded the film to feature length, developing the screenplay to take Quixote and [[Sancho Panza]] into the modern age. Filming stopped with the death of [[Francisco Reiguera]], the actor playing Quixote, in 1969. Orson Welles continued editing the film into the early 1970s. At the time of his death, the film remained largely a collection of footage in various states of editing. The project and, more important, Welles's conception of the project changed radically over time. A version of the film was created from available fragments in 1992 and released to a very negative reception.\n\nA version Oja Kodar supervised, with help from Jess Franco, assistant director during production, was released in 1992 to poor reviews.<ref>{{Citation|title=Don Quixote - Movie Reviews|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/don_quixote_1992/reviews|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\nFrederick Muller, the film editor for The ''Trial'', ''Chimes at Midnight,'' and the CBS Special ''Orson Bag,'' worked on editing three reels of the original, unadulterated version. When asked in 2013 by a journalist of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' for his opinion, he said that he felt that if released without image re-editing but with the addition of ''ad hoc'' sound and music, it probably would have been rather successful.\n\n=== ''The Merchant of Venice'' ===\n{{Main|The Merchant of Venice (1969 film)}}\nIn 1969, Welles was given a TV commission to film a condensed adaptation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.<ref name=\"Estrin\">Estrin, Mark W., and Orson Welles.

It was originally planned as a commercially viable thriller, to show that Welles could make a popular, successful film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2008novdec/welles.html|title=Orson Welles the Unknown \u2013 Harvard Film Archive|website=hcl.harvard.edu|access-date=2018-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130173547/http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2008novdec/welles.html|archive-date=January 30, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>  It was put on hold in 1970 when Welles worried that critics would not respond favorably to this film as his theatrical follow-up to the much-lauded ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'', and Welles focused instead on ''[[F for Fake]]''. It was abandoned altogether in 1973, perhaps due to the death of its star [[Laurence Harvey]]. In a 2015 interview, Oja Kodar blamed Welles's failure to complete the film on Jeanne Moreau's refusal to participate in its dubbing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.adorocinema.com/noticias/filmes/noticia-113308/|title=Exclusivo: Oja Kodar revela segredos de Orson Welles em Mostra do centen\u00e1rio do diretor|last=AdoroCinema|work=AdoroCinema|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Dune'' ====\n''[[Jodorowsky's Dune|Dune]]'', an early attempt at adapting [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune (novel)|sci-fi novel]] by Chilean film director [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], was to star Welles as the evil [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]]. Jodorowsky had personally chosen Welles for the role, but the planned film never advanced past pre-production.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==== ''Saint Jack'' ====\nIn 1978 Welles was lined up by his long-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Peter Bogdanovich]] (who was then acting as Welles's ''de facto'' agent) to direct ''[[Saint Jack]]'', an adaptation of the 1973 [[Paul Theroux]] novel about an American pimp in Singapore. [[Hugh Hefner]] and Bogdanovich's then-partner [[Cybill Shepherd]] were both attached to the project as producers, with Hefner providing finance through his [[Playboy]] productions. However, both Hefner and Shepherd became convinced that Bogdanovich himself would be a more commercially viable director than Welles, and insisted that Bogdanovich take over. Since Bogdanovich was also in need of work after a series of box office flops, he agreed. When the film was finally made in 1979 by Bogdanovich and Hefner (but without Welles or Shepherd's participation), Welles felt betrayed and according to Bogdanovich the two \"drifted apart a bit\".<ref>Peter Bogdanovich and Orson Welles, ''This is Orson Welles'' (New York, 1992, revised 1997 edition) pp.xxi-xxii</ref>\n\n==== ''Filming The Trial'' ====\nAfter the success of his 1978 film ''Filming Othello'' made for West German television, and mostly consisting of a monolog to the camera, Welles began shooting scenes for this follow-up film, but never completed it.<ref name=\"McBride\" />{{Rp|253|April 2014}}  What Welles did film was an 80-minute question-and-answer session in 1981 with film students asking about the film. The footage was kept by Welles's cinematographer [[Gary Graver]], who donated it to the Munich Film Museum, which then pieced it together with Welles's trailer for the film, into an 83-minute film which is occasionally screened at film festivals.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==== ''The Big Brass Ring'' ====\nWritten by Welles with Oja Kodar, ''[[The Big Brass Ring]]'' was adapted and filmed by director [[George Hickenlooper]] in partnership with writer [[F.X. Feeney]]. Both the Welles script and the 1999 film center on a U.S. Presidential hopeful in his 40s, his elderly mentor\u2014a former candidate for the Presidency, brought low by homosexual scandal\u2014and the Italian journalist probing for the truth of the relationship between these men. During the last years of his life, Welles struggled to get financing for the planned film; however, his efforts at casting [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Warren Beatty]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Paul Newman]] as the main character were unsuccessful. All of the actors turned down the role for various reasons.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==== ''The Cradle Will Rock'' ====\nIn 1984, Welles wrote the screenplay for a film he planned to direct, an autobiographical drama about the 1937 staging of ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''.<ref name=\"Tarbox\" />{{Rp|157\u2013159}} [[Rupert Everett]] was slated to play the young Welles.

G. Wells]]'s novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', which caused widespread panic because many listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was actually occurring.

While ''Mercury Summer Theatre'' featured half-hour adaptations of some classic Mercury radio shows from the 1930s, the first episode was a condensation of his ''Around the World'' stage play, and is the only record of Cole Porter's music for the project. Several original Mercury actors returned for the series, as well as Bernard Herrmann. Welles invested his earnings into his failing stage play. ''Commentaries'' was a political vehicle for him, continuing the themes from his ''New York Post'' column. Again, Welles lacked a clear focus, until the [[NAACP]] brought to his attention the case of [[Isaac Woodard]]. Welles brought significant attention to Woodard's cause.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/orson-welles-sought-justice-for-isaac-woodard-70-years-ago/ |title=Orson Welles Sought Justice for Issaac Woodard 70 years ago |last=Teal |first=Mike |date=July 28, 2016 |website= Wellesnet.com|access-date=April 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe last broadcast of ''Orson Welles Commentaries'' on October 6, 1946, marked the end of Welles's own radio shows.<ref name=\"Welles TIOW\" />{{Rp|401}}\n\n=== ''The Lady from Shanghai'' ===\n{{Main|The Lady from Shanghai}}\nThe film that Welles was obliged to make in exchange for Harry Cohn's help in financing the stage production ''[[Around the World (musical)|Around the World]]'' was ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'', filmed in 1947 for [[Columbia Pictures]]. Intended as a modest thriller, the budget skyrocketed after Cohn suggested that Welles's then-estranged second wife Rita Hayworth co-star.\n[[File:Lady from Shanghai trailer welles.JPG|thumb|left|Orson Welles in ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'' (1947)]]\nCohn disliked Welles's [[rough cut]], particularly the confusing plot and lack of close-ups, and was not in sympathy with Welles's [[Brechtian]] use of irony and [[black comedy]], especially in a farcical courtroom scene. Cohn ordered extensive editing and re-shoots. After heavy editing by the studio, approximately one hour of Welles's first cut was removed, including much of a climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse. While expressing displeasure at the cuts, Welles was appalled particularly with the musical score. The film was considered a disaster in America at the time of release, though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors has since become a touchstone of [[film noir]]. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce.\n\nAlthough ''The Lady From Shanghai'' was acclaimed in Europe, it was not embraced in the U.S. until decades later, where it is now often regarded as a classic of film noir.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-lady-from-shanghai/Film?oid=2552830|title=The Lady From Shanghai|last=Kehr|first=Dave|website=Chicago Reader|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}</ref> A similar difference in reception on opposite sides of the Atlantic, followed by greater American acceptance, befell the Welles-inspired Chaplin film ''Monsieur Verdoux'', originally to be directed by Welles starring Chaplin, then directed by Chaplin with the idea credited to Welles.\n\n=== ''Macbeth'' ===\n{{Main|Macbeth (1948 film)}}\nPrior to 1948, Welles convinced [[Republic Pictures]] to let him direct a [[Macbeth (1948 film)|low-budget version]] of ''[[Macbeth]]'', which featured highly stylized sets and costumes, and a cast of actors lip-syncing to a pre-recorded soundtrack, one of many innovative cost-cutting techniques Welles deployed in an attempt to make an epic film from [[B-movie]] resources. The script, adapted by Welles, is a violent reworking of Shakespeare's original, freely cutting and pasting lines into new contexts via a [[collage]] technique and recasting ''Macbeth'' as a clash of pagan and proto-Christian ideologies. Some voodoo trappings of the famous Welles/Houseman Negro Theatre stage adaptation are visible, especially in the film's characterization of the [[Weird Sisters]], who create an effigy of Macbeth as a charm to enchant him. Of all Welles's post-''Kane'' Hollywood productions, ''Macbeth'' is stylistically closest to ''Citizen Kane'' in its long takes and deep focus photography.\n\nRepublic initially trumpeted the film as an important work but decided it did not care for the Scottish accents and held up general release for almost a year after early negative press reaction, including ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''{{'}}s comment that Welles's film \"doth foully slaughter Shakespeare.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Orson Welles doth foully slaughter Shakespeare in a dialect version of his \"Tragedy of Macbeth\" \u2014 or so sayeth LIFE magazine|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=729|work=Wellesnet|access-date=September 1, 2011|date=2009-06-19}}</ref> Welles left for Europe, while co-producer and lifelong supporter [[Richard Wilson (producer)|Richard Wilson]] reworked the soundtrack. Welles returned and cut 20 minutes from the film at Republic's request and recorded narration to cover some gaps. The film was decried as a disaster. ''Macbeth'' had influential fans in Europe, especially the French poet and filmmaker [[Jean Cocteau]], who hailed the film's \"crude, irreverent power\" and careful shot design, and described the characters as haunting \"the corridors of some dreamlike subway, an abandoned coal mine, and ruined cellars oozing with water.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Tony|title=Macbeth|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2006/cteq/macbeth-2/|work=[[Senses of Cinema]]|access-date=September 1, 2011|date=2006-02-06}}</ref>\n\n== Europe (1948\u20131956) ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nIn Italy he starred as [[Cagliostro]] in the 1948 film ''[[Black Magic (1949 film)|Black Magic]]''. His co-star, [[Akim Tamiroff]], impressed Welles so much that Tamiroff would appear in four of Welles's productions during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe following year, Welles starred as [[Harry Lime]] in [[Carol Reed]]'s ''[[The Third Man]]'', alongside [[Joseph Cotten]], his friend and co-star from ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', with a script by [[Graham Greene]] and a memorable score by [[Anton Karas]].\n\nA few years later, British radio producer [[Harry Alan Towers]] would resurrect the Lime character in the radio series ''[[The Adventures of Harry Lime]]''.\n\nWelles appeared as [[Cesare Borgia]] in the 1949 Italian film ''[[Prince of Foxes (film)|Prince of Foxes]]'', with [[Tyrone Power]] and Mercury Theatre alumnus [[Everett Sloane]], and as the Mongol warrior Bayan in the 1950 film version of the novel ''[[The Black Rose]]'' (again with Tyrone Power).\n<ref>Carol Reed biography</ref>\n\n=== ''Othello'' ===\n{{Main|Othello (1951 film)}}\n[[File:Othello-Welles-Cloutier.jpg|thumb|upright|Welles and [[Suzanne Cloutier]] in ''[[Othello (1951 film)|Othello]]'' (1951)]]\n\nDuring this time, Welles was channeling his money from acting jobs into a self-financed film version of Shakespeare's play ''[[Othello]]''. From 1949 to 1951, Welles worked on ''[[Othello (1951 film)|Othello]]'', filming on location in [[Italy]] and [[Morocco]]. The film featured Welles's friends, [[Miche\u00e1l Mac Liamm\u00f3ir]] as [[Iago]] and [[Hilton Edwards]] as [[Desdemona (Othello)|Desdemona]]'s father [[Brabantio]]. [[Suzanne Cloutier]] starred as Desdemona and [[The Campbell Playhouse (TV series)|Campbell Playhouse]] alumnus [[Robert Coote]] appeared as Iago's associate Roderigo.\n\nFilming was suspended several times as Welles ran out of funds and left for acting jobs, accounted in detail in MacLiamm\u00f3ir's published memoir ''Put Money in Thy Purse''. The American release prints had a technically flawed soundtrack, suffering from a dropout of sound at every quiet moment. Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles-Smith, restored ''Othello'' in 1992 for a wide re-release. The restoration included reconstructing [[Angelo Francesco Lavagnino]]'s original musical score, which was originally inaudible, and adding ambient stereo sound effects, which were not in the original film. The restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America.\n\nIn 1952, Welles continued finding work in England after the success of the ''Harry Lime'' radio show. Harry Alan Towers offered Welles another series, ''[[The Black Museum]]'', which ran for 52 weeks with Welles as host and narrator. Director Herbert Wilcox offered Welles the part of the murdered victim in ''[[Trent's Last Case (1952 film)|Trent's Last Case]]'', based on the novel by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|E. C. Bentley]]. In 1953, the [[BBC]] hired Welles to read an hour of selections from [[Walt Whitman]]'s epic poem ''[[Song of Myself]]''. Towers hired Welles again, to play [[Professor Moriarty]] in the radio series, ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'', starring [[John Gielgud]] and [[Ralph Richardson]].\n\nWelles briefly returned to America to make his first appearance on television, starring in the ''[[Omnibus (US TV series)|Omnibus]]'' presentation of ''[[King Lear (1953 TV drama)|King Lear]]'', broadcast live on [[CBS]] October 18, 1953. Directed by [[Peter Brook]], the production costarred [[Natasha Parry]], [[Beatrice Straight]] and [[Arnold Moss]].<ref>[https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/40866/king-lear/ DVD Talk review] February 9, 2010 (Retrieved December 29, 2011)</ref>\n\nIn 1954, director George More O'Ferrall offered Welles the title role in the 'Lord Mountdrago' segment of ''[[Three Cases of Murder]]'', co-starring [[Alan Badel]]. [[Herbert Wilcox]] cast Welles as the antagonist in ''[[Trouble in the Glen]]'' opposite [[Margaret Lockwood]], [[Forrest Tucker]] and [[Victor McLaglen]]. Old friend [[John Huston]] cast him as Father Mapple in his [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|1956 film adaptation]] of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', starring [[Gregory Peck]].\n\n=== ''Mr. Arkadin'' ===\n{{Main|Mr. Arkadin}}\n[[File:Orson Welles.jpg|thumb|upright|Welles in Madrid during the filming of ''Mr. Arkadin'' in 1954]]\nWelles's next turn as director was the film ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]'' (1955), which was produced by his political mentor from the 1940s, [[Louis Dolivet]]. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to delve into the secrets of his past. The film stars [[Robert Arden]], who had worked on the Harry Lime series; Welles's third wife, [[Paola Mori]], whose voice was dubbed by actress [[Billie Whitelaw]]; and guest stars [[Akim Tamiroff]], [[Michael Redgrave]], [[Katina Paxinou]] and [[Mischa Auer]]. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually five different versions of the film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version that Dolivet completed was retitled ''Confidential Report''. In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the [[Munich Film Museum]] oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements.\n\n=== Television projects ===\nIn 1955, Welles also directed two television series for the BBC. The first was ''[[Orson Welles' Sketch Book]]'', a series of six 15-minute shows featuring Welles drawing in a sketchbook to illustrate his reminiscences for the camera (including such topics as the filming of ''It's All True'' and the Isaac Woodard case), and the second was ''[[Around the World with Orson Welles]]'', a series of six travelogues set in different locations around Europe (such as [[Vienna]], the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] between France and Spain, and England). Welles served as host and interviewer, his commentary including documentary facts and his own personal observations (a technique he would continue to explore in later works).\n\nIn 1956, Welles completed ''[[Portrait of Gina]]''. The film cans would remain in a lost-and-found locker at the hotel for several decades, where they were discovered after Welles's death.\n\n== Return to Hollywood (1956\u20131959) ==\n[[File:Lucille Ball Orson Welles I Love Lucy 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|Welles the magician with Lucille Ball in ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' (October 15, 1956)]]\nIn 1956, Welles returned to Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theibtaurisblog.com/2012/08/30/orson-welles-and-pan-europeanism-1947-1970/ |title=Orson Welles and pan-Europeanism 1957\u20131970 |last=Thevoz |first=Seth |publisher=I.B.

Although he had a complete version of the film shot and edited at least once, he would continue toying with the editing well into the 1980s, he never completed a version film he was fully satisfied with, and would junk existing footage and shoot new footage. (In one case, he had a complete cut ready in which Quixote and Sancho Panza end up going to the moon, but he felt the ending was rendered obsolete by the 1969 moon landings, and burned 10 reels of this version.) As the process went on, Welles gradually voiced all of the characters himself and provided narration. In 1992, the director [[Jes\u00fas Franco]] constructed a film out of the portions of ''Quixote'' left behind by Welles. Some of the film stock had decayed badly. While the Welles footage was greeted with interest, the post-production by Franco was met with harsh criticism.\n\nIn 1961, Welles directed ''In the Land of Don Quixote'', a series of eight half-hour episodes for the Italian television network [[RAI]]. Similar to the ''Around the World with Orson Welles'' series, they presented travelogues of Spain and included Welles's wife, Paola, and their daughter, Beatrice. Though Welles was fluent in Italian, the network was not interested in him providing Italian narration because of his accent, and the series sat unreleased until 1964, by which time the network had added Italian narration of its own. Ultimately, versions of the episodes were released with the original musical score Welles had approved, but without the narration.\n\n=== ''The Trial'' ===\n{{Main|The Trial (1962 film)}}\nIn 1962, Welles directed his adaptation of ''[[The Trial (1962 film)|The Trial]]'', based on [[The Trial|the novel]] by [[Franz Kafka]] and produced by Michael and [[Alexander Salkind]]. The cast included [[Anthony Perkins]] as Josef K, [[Jeanne Moreau]], [[Romy Schneider]], [[Paola Mori]] and [[Akim Tamiroff]]. While filming exteriors in [[Zagreb]], Welles was informed that the Salkinds had run out of money, meaning that there could be no set construction. No stranger to shooting on found locations, Welles soon filmed the interiors in the [[Gare d'Orsay]], at that time an abandoned railway station in Paris. Welles thought the location possessed a \"[[Jules Verne]] modernism\" and a melancholy sense of \"waiting\", both suitable for Kafka. To remain in the spirit of Kafka Welles set up the cutting room together with the Film Editor, Frederick Muller (as Fritz Muller), in the old un-used, cold, depressing, station master office. The film failed at the box-office. [[Peter Bogdanovich]] would later observe that Welles found the film riotously funny. Welles also told a BBC interviewer that it was his best film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/trial%20bbc%20interview.htm |title=Welles BBC interview |publisher=Wellesnet.com |access-date=March 30, 2010}}</ref> While filming ''The Trial'' Welles met [[Oja Kodar]], who later became his mistress and collaborator for the last 20 years of his life.<ref name=\"Welles TIOW\" />{{Rp|428}}\n\nWelles played a film director in ''[[La Ricotta]]'' (1963), [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s segment of the ''[[Ro.Go.Pa.G.]]'' movie, although his renowned voice was dubbed by Italian writer Giorgio Bassani.<ref name=\"Welles TIOW\" />{{Rp|516|date=May 2012}} He continued taking what work he could find acting, narrating or hosting other people's work, and began filming ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'', which was completed in 1965.\n\n=== ''Chimes at Midnight'' ===\n{{Main|Chimes at Midnight}}\n[[File:Orson-Welles-Falstaff.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'' (1965)]]\nFilmed in Spain, ''Chimes at Midnight'' was based on Welles's play, ''[[Chimes at Midnight#Five Kings (1939)|Five Kings]]'', in which he drew material from six Shakespeare plays to tell the story of [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]] (Welles) and his relationship with [[Henry V of England|Prince Hal]] ([[Keith Baxter (actor)|Keith Baxter]]).

Released in 1968, it stars Jeanne Moreau, [[Roger Coggio]] and [[Norman Eshley]]. The film had a successful run in French theaters. At this time Welles met Oja Kodar again, and gave her a letter he had written to her and had been keeping for four years; they would not be parted again. They immediately began a collaboration both personal and professional. The first of these was an adaptation of Blixen's ''The Heroine'', meant to be a companion piece to ''The Immortal Story'' and starring Kodar. Unfortunately, funding disappeared after one day's shooting. After completing this film, he appeared in a brief cameo as [[Cardinal Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] in [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s adaptation of ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]''\u2014a role for which he won considerable acclaim.\n\n[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Sergei Bondarchuk and Orson Welles, Sarajevo, 29. november 1969. Movie premier Battle of Neretva.JPG|thumb|[[Sergei Bondarchuk]] and Welles at the ''[[Battle of Neretva (film)|Battle of Neretva]]'' premiere in [[Sarajevo]] (November 1969)]]\nIn 1967, Welles began directing ''[[The Deep (1970 film)|The Deep]]'', based on the novel ''[[Dead Calm (novel)|Dead Calm]]'' by [[Charles Williams (U.S. author)|Charles Williams]] and filmed off the shore of [[Yugoslavia]]. The cast included Jeanne Moreau, [[Laurence Harvey]] and Kodar. Personally financed by Welles and Kodar, they could not obtain the funds to complete the project, and it was abandoned a few years later after the death of Harvey. The surviving footage was eventually edited and released by the Filmmuseum M\u00fcnchen. In 1968 Welles began filming a TV special for CBS under the title ''Orson's Bag'', combining travelogue, comedy skits and a condensation of Shakespeare's play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' with Welles as [[Shylock]]. In 1969 Welles called again the Film Editor Frederick Muller to work with him re-editing the material and they set up cutting rooms at the Safa Palatino Studios in Rome. Funding for the show sent by CBS to Welles in Switzerland was seized by the IRS. Without funding, the show was not completed. The surviving [[The Merchant of Venice (unfinished film)|film]] clips portions were eventually released by the Filmmuseum M\u00fcnchen.\n\nIn 1969, Welles authorized the use of his name for a cinema in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The [[Orson Welles Cinema]] remained in operation until 1986, with Welles making a personal appearance there in 1977. Also in 1969 he played a supporting role in [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Kremlin Letter]]''. Drawn by the numerous offers he received to work in television and films, and upset by a tabloid scandal reporting his affair with Kodar, Welles abandoned the editing of ''Don Quixote'' and moved back to America in 1970.\n\n== Later career (1970\u20131985) ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nWelles returned to Hollywood, where he continued to self-finance his film and television projects. While offers to act, narrate and host continued, Welles also found himself in great demand on television talk shows. He made frequent appearances for [[The Dick Cavett Show|Dick Cavett]], [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Johnny Carson]], [[The Dean Martin Show|Dean Martin]] and [[The Merv Griffin Show|Merv Griffin]].\n\nWelles's primary focus during his final years was ''[[The Other Side of the Wind]]'', a project that was filmed intermittently between 1970 and 1976. Co-written by Welles and Oja Kodar, it is the story of an aging film director ([[John Huston]]) looking for funds to complete his final film. The cast includes [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Susan Strasberg]], [[Norman Foster (director)|Norman Foster]], [[Edmond O'Brien]], [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] and [[Dennis Hopper]]. Financed by Iranian backers, ownership of the film fell into a legal quagmire after the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] was deposed. The legal disputes kept the film in its unfinished state until early 2017, and was finally released in November 2018.\n[[File:Who's Out There (1973).ogv|thumb|thumbtime=21|Welles often invokes \"The War of the Worlds\" as host of ''[[c:File:Who's Out There (1973).ogv|Who's Out There?]]'' (1973), an [[CINE|award-winning]] [[NASA]] documentary short film by [[Robert Drew]] about the likelihood of [[extraterrestrial life|life on other planets]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drewassociates.com/films/whos-out-there/ |title=Who's Out There? |last1=Drew |first1=Robert  |date=1973 |website= |publisher=Drew Associates |access-date=2016-08-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/whos-out-there-orson-welles-narrates-a-nasa-show-on-intelligent-life-in-the-universe/ |title=Who's Out There\u2014Orson Welles narrates a NASA show on intelligent life in the Universe|last1= |first1=  |date=February 10, 2008  |website= |publisher=Wellesnet |access-date=2016-08-19 }}</ref>]]\n\nWelles portrayed [[Louis XVIII of France]] in the 1970 film ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'', and narrated the beginning and ending scenes of the historical comedy ''[[Start the Revolution Without Me]]'' (1970).\n\nIn 1971, Welles directed a short adaptation of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', a one-man performance on a bare stage, reminiscent of his 1955 stage production ''[[Moby Dick\u2014Rehearsed]]''. Never completed, it was eventually released by the Filmmuseum M\u00fcnchen. He also appeared in ''[[Ten Days' Wonder (film)|Ten Days' Wonder]]'', co-starring with [[Anthony Perkins]] and directed by [[Claude Chabrol]], based on a detective novel by [[Ellery Queen]]. That same year, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] gave him an honorary award \"For superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures\". Welles pretended to be out of town and sent [[John Huston]] to claim the award, thanking the Academy on film. Huston criticized the Academy for awarding Welles, even while they refused to give Welles any work.\n\nIn 1972, Welles acted as on-screen narrator for the film documentary version of [[Alvin Toffler]]'s 1970 book ''[[Future Shock]]''. Working again for a British producer, Welles played [[Long John Silver]] in director [[John Hough (director)|John Hough]]'s ''[[Treasure Island (1972 live-action film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1972), an adaptation of the [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] novel, which had been the second story broadcast by ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'' in 1938. This was the last time he played the lead role in a major film. Welles also contributed to the script, his writing credit was attributed to the pseudonym 'O. W. Jeeves'. In some versions of the film Welles's original recorded dialog was redubbed by [[Robert Rietty]].\n[[File:F-for-Fake.jpg|thumb|Orson Welles in ''[[F for Fake]]'' (1974), a [[film essay]] and the last film he completed.]]\nIn 1973, Welles completed ''[[F for Fake]]'', a personal essay film about art forger [[Elmyr de Hory]] and the biographer [[Clifford Irving]]. Based on an existing documentary by [[Fran\u00e7ois Reichenbach]], it included new material with Oja Kodar, Joseph Cotten, [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]] and [[William Alland]]. An excerpt of Welles's 1930s ''War of the Worlds'' broadcast was recreated for this film; however, none of the dialogue heard in the film actually matches what was originally broadcast. Welles filmed a five-minute trailer, rejected in the U.S., that featured several shots of a topless Kodar.\n\nWelles hosted a British syndicated anthology series, ''[[Orson Welles' Great Mysteries|Orson Welles's Great Mysteries]]'', during the 1973\u201374 television season. His brief introductions to the 26 half-hour episodes were shot in July 1973 by Gary Graver.<ref name=\"Welles TIOW\" />{{Rp|443}} The year 1974 also saw Welles lending his voice for that year's remake of [[Agatha Christie]]'s classic thriller ''[[And Then There Were None (1974 film)|Ten Little Indians]]'' produced by his former associate, Harry Alan Towers and starring an international cast that included [[Oliver Reed]], [[Elke Sommer]] and [[Herbert Lom]].\n\nIn 1975, Welles narrated the documentary ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]'', focusing on [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons from the 1940s. Also in 1975, the [[American Film Institute]] presented Welles with its third Lifetime Achievement Award (the first two going to director [[John Ford]] and actor [[James Cagney]]).

Unable to find network interest, the pilot was never broadcast. Also in 1979, Welles appeared in the biopic ''[[The Secret of Nikola Tesla]]'', and a cameo in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' as Lew Lord.\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s, Welles participated in a series of famous television commercial advertisements.

He also did commercials for the Preview Subscription Television Service seen on stations around the country including WCLQ/Cleveland, KNDL/St. Louis and WSMW/Boston.

In 1982, the BBC broadcast ''The Orson Welles Story'' in the ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' series. Interviewed by Leslie Megahey, Welles examined his past in great detail, and several people from his professional past were interviewed as well. It was reissued in 1990 as ''With Orson Welles: Stories of a Life in Film''. Welles provided narration for the tracks \"Defender\" from [[Manowar]]'s 1987 album ''[[Fighting the World]]'' and \"Dark Avenger\" on their 1982 album, ''[[Battle Hymns (Manowar album)|Battle Hymns]]''.

Another project he worked on was ''[[Filming The Trial]]'', the second in a proposed series of documentaries examining his feature films. While much was shot for these projects, none of them was completed. All of them were eventually released by the Filmmuseum M\u00fcnchen.\n\nIn 1984, Welles narrated the short-lived television series ''[[Scene of the Crime (1984 TV series)|Scene of the Crime]]''. During the early years of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', Welles was the voice of the unseen character Robin Masters, a famous writer and [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]]. Welles's death forced this minor character to largely be written out of the series.

Filming stopped with the death of [[Francisco Reiguera]], the actor playing Quixote, in 1969. Orson Welles continued editing the film into the early 1970s. At the time of his death, the film remained largely a collection of footage in various states of editing.

A version of the film was created from available fragments in 1992 and released to a very negative reception.\n\nA version Oja Kodar supervised, with help from Jess Franco, assistant director during production, was released in 1992 to poor reviews.<ref>{{Citation|title=Don Quixote - Movie Reviews|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/don_quixote_1992/reviews|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\nFrederick Muller, the film editor for The ''Trial'', ''Chimes at Midnight,'' and the CBS Special ''Orson Bag,'' worked on editing three reels of the original, unadulterated version.

It was planned in extreme detail and some test shots were filmed; the footage is now lost. It was planned to be entirely shot in [[long take]]s from the point of view of the narrator, [[Charles Marlow|Marlow]], who would be played by Welles; his reflection would occasionally be seen in the window as his boat sailed down river.

''Santa'' was adapted from the novel by Mexican writer [[Federico Gamboa]]. The film would have marked the debut of Dolores del R\u00edo in the Mexican cinema. Welles made a correction of the script in 13 extraordinary sequences. The high salary demanded by del R\u00edo stopped the project.

The film was a movie version of the novel by the same name by Calder Marshall. In the story, del R\u00edo would play Elena Medina, \"the most beautiful girl in the world\", with Welles playing an American who becomes entangled in a mission to disrupt a Nazi plot to overthrow the Mexican government.

[[Charlie Chaplin]] initially agreed to star in it, but later changed his mind, citing never having been directed by someone else in a [[feature film|feature]] before.

He began scouting for locations in Europe whilst filming ''[[Black Magic (1949 film)|Black Magic]]'', but Korda was short of money, so sold the rights to Columbia pictures, who eventually dismissed Welles from the project, and then sold the rights to [[United Artists]], who in turn made [[Cyrano de Bergerac (1950 film)|a film version in 1950]], which was not based on Welles's script.<ref name=\"Welles TIOW\" />{{Rp|106\u2013108}}\n\n==== ''Around the World in Eighty Days'' ====\nAfter Welles's elaborate [[Around the World (musical)|musical stage version]] of this [[Jules Verne]] novel, encompassing 38 different sets, went live in 1946, Welles shot some test footage in Morocco in 1947 for a film version.

Using bare, minimalist sets, Welles alternated between a cast of nineteenth-century actors rehearsing a production of ''Moby Dick'', with scenes from ''Moby Dick'' itself. [[Kenneth Williams]], a cast member who was apprehensive about the entire project, recorded in his autobiography that Welles's dim, atmospheric stage lighting made some of the footage so dark as to be unwatchable.

Welles intended this completed sketch to be one of several items in a television special on London. Other items filmed for this special \u2013 all included in the \"One Man Band\" documentary by his partner Oja Kodar&nbsp;\u2014 comprised a sketch on Winston Churchill (played in silhouette by Welles), a sketch on [[Peerage|peers]] in a stately home, a feature on [[gentlemen's clubs|London gentlemen's clubs]], and a sketch featuring Welles being mocked by his snide [[Savile Row]] tailor (played by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]]).\n\n==== ''Treasure Island'' ====\nWelles wrote two screenplays for ''[[Treasure Island (1972 live-action film)|Treasure Island]]'' in the 1960s, and was eager to seek financial backing to direct it. His plan was to film it in Spain in concert with ''[[Chimes at Midnight|Chimes at Midnigh]]<nowiki/>t''. Welles intended to play the part of Long John Silver. He wanted [[Keith Baxter (actor)|Keith Baxter]] to play Doctor Livesey and [[John Gielgud]] to take on the role of Squire Trelawney. Australian-born child actor Fraser MacIntosh (''[[The Boy Cried Murder]]''), then 11-years old, was cast as Jim Hawkins and flown to Spain for the shoot, which would have been directed by Jess Franco. About 70 percent of the ''Chimes at Midnight'' cast would have had roles in ''Treasure Island''.

It was abandoned altogether in 1973, perhaps due to the death of its star [[Laurence Harvey]]. In a 2015 interview, Oja Kodar blamed Welles's failure to complete the film on Jeanne Moreau's refusal to participate in its dubbing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.adorocinema.com/noticias/filmes/noticia-113308/|title=Exclusivo: Oja Kodar revela segredos de Orson Welles em Mostra do centen\u00e1rio do diretor|last=AdoroCinema|work=AdoroCinema|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Dune'' ====\n''[[Jodorowsky's Dune|Dune]]'', an early attempt at adapting [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune (novel)|sci-fi novel]] by Chilean film director [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], was to star Welles as the evil [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]].

[[Hugh Hefner]] and Bogdanovich's then-partner [[Cybill Shepherd]] were both attached to the project as producers, with Hefner providing finance through his [[Playboy]] productions. However, both Hefner and Shepherd became convinced that Bogdanovich himself would be a more commercially viable director than Welles, and insisted that Bogdanovich take over. Since Bogdanovich was also in need of work after a series of box office flops, he agreed. When the film was finally made in 1979 by Bogdanovich and Hefner (but without Welles or Shepherd's participation), Welles felt betrayed and according to Bogdanovich the two \"drifted apart a bit\".<ref>Peter Bogdanovich and Orson Welles, ''This is Orson Welles'' (New York, 1992, revised 1997 edition) pp.xxi-xxii</ref>\n\n==== ''Filming The Trial'' ====\nAfter the success of his 1978 film ''Filming Othello'' made for West German television, and mostly consisting of a monolog to the camera, Welles began shooting scenes for this follow-up film, but never completed it.<ref name=\"McBride\" />{{Rp|253|April 2014}}  What Welles did film was an 80-minute question-and-answer session in 1981 with film students asking about the film. The footage was kept by Welles's cinematographer [[Gary Graver]], who donated it to the Munich Film Museum, which then pieced it together with Welles's trailer for the film, into an 83-minute film which is occasionally screened at film festivals.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==== ''The Big Brass Ring'' ====\nWritten by Welles with Oja Kodar, ''[[The Big Brass Ring]]'' was adapted and filmed by director [[George Hickenlooper]] in partnership with writer [[F.X.

Both the Welles script and the 1999 film center on a U.S. Presidential hopeful in his 40s, his elderly mentor\u2014a former candidate for the Presidency, brought low by homosexual scandal\u2014and the Italian journalist probing for the truth of the relationship between these men. During the last years of his life, Welles struggled to get financing for the planned film; however, his efforts at casting [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Warren Beatty]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Paul Newman]] as the main character were unsuccessful. All of the actors turned down the role for various reasons.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==== ''The Cradle Will Rock'' ====\nIn 1984, Welles wrote the screenplay for a film he planned to direct, an autobiographical drama about the 1937 staging of ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''.<ref name=\"Tarbox\" />{{Rp|157\u2013159}} [[Rupert Everett]] was slated to play the young Welles.

He was the fourth of five children of [[Count]] Nikolai Ilyich Tolstoy (1794\u20131837), a veteran of the [[French invasion of Russia|Patriotic War of 1812]], and Countess Mariya Tolstaya (n\u00e9e Volkonskaya; 1790\u20131830).

Others who followed the same path were [[Alexander Herzen]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]]. During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy witnessed a public execution in Paris, a traumatic experience that marked the rest of his life. In a letter to his friend [[Vasily Botkin]], Tolstoy wrote: \"The truth is that the State is a conspiracy designed not only to exploit, but above all to corrupt its citizens ...

Tolstoy read Hugo's newly finished ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''. The similar evocation of battle scenes in Hugo's novel and Tolstoy's ''[[War and Peace]]'' indicates this influence. Tolstoy's political philosophy was also influenced by a March 1861 visit to French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], then living in exile under an assumed name in Brussels. Tolstoy reviewed Proudhon's forthcoming publication, ''La Guerre et la Paix'' (\"''War and Peace''\" in French), and later used the title for his masterpiece.

Though he later rejected them as sentimental, a great deal of Tolstoy's own life is revealed. They retain their relevance as accounts of the universal story of growing up.\n\nTolstoy served as a [[second lieutenant]] in an artillery regiment during the [[Crimean War]], recounted in his ''[[Sevastopol Sketches]]''. His experiences in battle helped stir his subsequent [[pacifism]] and gave him material for realistic depiction of the horrors of war in his later work.<ref>''Government is Violence: essays on anarchism and pacifism''. Leo Tolstoy \u2013 1990 \u2013 Phoenix Press</ref>\n\nHis fiction consistently attempts to convey realistically the Russian society in which he lived.<ref>''Tolstoy: the making of a novelist. E'' Crankshaw \u2013 1974 \u2013 Weidenfeld & Nicolson</ref> ''[[The Cossacks (novel)|The Cossacks]]'' (1863) describes the [[Cossack]] life and people through a story of a Russian aristocrat in love with a Cossack girl. ''Anna Karenina'' (1877) tells parallel stories of an adulterous woman trapped by the conventions and falsities of society and of a philosophical landowner (much like Tolstoy), who works alongside the peasants in the fields and seeks to reform their lives. Tolstoy not only drew from his own life experiences but also created characters in his own image, such as Pierre Bezukhov and Prince Andrei in ''War and Peace'', Levin in ''Anna Karenina'' and to some extent, Prince Nekhlyudov in ''Resurrection''.\n\n{{Multiple image\n | header = ''[[The Power of Darkness]]''\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer = 2015 at Vienna's [[Akademietheater]]\n | image1 = Die Macht der Finsternis 2354-Peralta.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 =\n | image2 =Die Macht der Finsternis 2417-Peralta.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 =\n | image3 =Die Macht der Finsternis 2465-Peralta.jpg\n | alt3 =\n | caption3 =\n}}\n''War and Peace'' is generally thought to be one of the greatest novels ever written, remarkable for its dramatic breadth and unity. Its vast canvas includes 580 characters, many historical with others fictional. The story moves from family life to the headquarters of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], from the court of [[Alexander I of Russia]] to the battlefields of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]]. Tolstoy's original idea for the novel was to investigate the causes of the [[Decembrist revolt]], to which it refers only in the last chapters, from which can be deduced that [[Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky|Andrei Bolkonsky]]'s son will become one of the Decembrists. The novel explores Tolstoy's theory of history, and in particular the insignificance of individuals such as Napoleon and Alexander. Somewhat surprisingly, Tolstoy did not consider ''War and Peace'' to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written at that time to be novels). This view becomes less surprising if one considers that Tolstoy was a novelist of the [[realism (arts)|realist]] school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life.<ref>Tolstoy and the Development of Realism. G Lukacs. ''Marxists on Literature: An Anthology'', London: Penguin, 1977</ref> ''War and Peace'' (which is to Tolstoy really an [[Epic poetry|epic]] in prose) therefore did not qualify. Tolstoy thought that ''Anna Karenina'' was his first true novel.<ref>''Tolstoy and the Novel''. J Bayley \u2013 1967 \u2013 Chatto & Windus</ref>\n\nAfter ''Anna Karenina'', Tolstoy concentrated on Christian themes, and his later novels such as ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich'' (1886) and ''[[What Is to Be Done? (Tolstoy)|What Is to Be Done?]]'' develop a radical [[anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifist]] Christian philosophy which led to his [[excommunication]] from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1901.<ref>''Church and State''. L Tolstoy&nbsp;\u2013 On Life and Essays on Religion, 1934</ref> For all the praise showered on ''Anna Karenina'' and ''War and Peace'', Tolstoy rejected the two works later in his life as something not as true of reality.<ref>''Women in Tolstoy: the ideal and the erotic'' R.C. Benson \u2013 1973 \u2013 University of Illinois Press</ref>\n\nIn his novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'', Tolstoy attempts to expose the injustice of man-made laws and the hypocrisy of institutionalized church. Tolstoy also explores and explains the economic philosophy of [[Georgism]], of which he had become a very strong advocate towards the end of his life.\n\nTolstoy also tried himself in poetry with several soldier songs written during his military service and fairy tales in verse such as ''Volga-bogatyr'' and ''Oaf'' stylized as national folk songs. They were written between 1871 and 1874 for his ''Russian Book for Reading'', a collection of short stories in four volumes (total of 629 stories in various genres) published along with the ''New Azbuka'' textbook and addressed to schoolchildren. Nevertheless, he was skeptical about poetry as a genre. As he famously said, \"Writing poetry is like ploughing and dancing at the same time\". According to [[Valentin Bulgakov]], he criticised poets, including [[Alexander Pushkin]], for their \"false\" epithets used \"simply to make it rhyme\".<ref>''Leo Tolstoy (1874)''.

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], who died thirty years before Tolstoy's death, thought him the greatest of all living novelists. [[Gustave Flaubert]], on reading a translation of ''War and Peace'', exclaimed, \"What an artist and what a psychologist!\" [[Anton Chekhov]], who often visited Tolstoy at his country estate, wrote, \"When literature possesses a Tolstoy, it is easy and pleasant to be a writer; even when you know you have achieved nothing yourself and are still achieving nothing, this is not as terrible as it might otherwise be, because Tolstoy achieves for everyone. What he does serves to justify all the hopes and aspirations invested in literature.\" The 19th-century British poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] opined that \"A novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life.\"<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nLater novelists continued to appreciate Tolstoy's art, but sometimes also expressed criticism. [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] wrote \"I am attracted by his earnestness and by his power of detail, but I am repelled by his looseness of construction and by his unreasonable and impracticable mysticism.\"<ref name=\"ACD\">{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=Arthur Conan|title=My Favourite Novelist and His Best Book|date= January 1898|location=London|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1306981h.html|accessdate=6 October 2017}}</ref> [[Virginia Woolf]] declared him \"the greatest of all novelists.\"<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> [[James Joyce]] noted that \"He is never dull, never stupid, never tired, never pedantic, never theatrical!\" [[Thomas Mann]] wrote of Tolstoy's seemingly guileless artistry: \"Seldom did art work so much like nature.\" [[Vladimir Nabokov]] heaped superlatives upon ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'' and ''Anna Karenina''; he questioned, however, the reputation of ''War and Peace'', and sharply criticized ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' and ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata]]''.\n\n== Religious and political beliefs ==\n{{anarchism sidebar}}\n[[File:Ilya Repin - Leo Tolstoy Barefoot - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Tolstoy dressed in peasant clothing, by [[Ilya Repin]] (1901)]]\nAfter reading [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: \"Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I've never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer\".<ref>Tolstoy's Letter to A.A. Fet, 30 August 1869</ref>\n\nIn Chapter VI of ''[[A Confession]]'', Tolstoy quoted the final paragraph of Schopenhauer's work. It explains how a complete [[self-denial|denial of self]] causes only a relative nothingness which is not to be feared. Tolstoy was struck by the description of Christian, [[Buddhist]], and [[Hindu]] ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness. After reading passages such as the following, which abound in Schopenhauer's ethical chapters, the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will: <blockquote> But this very necessity of involuntary suffering (by poor people) for [[eternal salvation]] is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior ([[Matthew 19:24]]): \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\" Therefore, those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation, chose [[simple living|voluntary poverty]] when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in wealth. Thus [[Buddha]] [[Sakyamuni]] was born a prince, but voluntarily took to the mendicant's staff; and [[Francis of Assisi]], the founder of the [[mendicant orders]] who, as a youngster at a ball, where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together, was asked: \"Now Francis, will you not soon make your choice from these beauties?\" and who replied: \"I have made a far more beautiful choice!\" \"Whom?\" \"''La povert\u00e0'' (poverty)\": whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a mendicant.<ref>Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. II, \u00a7&nbsp;170</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1884, Tolstoy wrote a book called ''What I Believe'', in which he openly confessed his Christian beliefs. He affirmed his belief in [[Jesus Christ]]'s [[Teachings of Jesus|teachings]] and was particularly influenced by the [[Sermon on the Mount]], and the injunction to [[turn the other cheek]], which he understood as a \"commandment of non-resistance to evil by force\" and a doctrine of [[pacifism]] and [[nonviolence]]. In his work ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'', he explains that he considered mistaken the Church's doctrine because they had made a \"perversion\" of Christ's teachings. Tolstoy also received letters from American [[Quakers]] who introduced him to the non-violence writings of Quaker Christians such as [[George Fox]], [[William Penn]] and [[Jonathan Dymond]]. Tolstoy believed being a Christian required him to be a pacifist; the apparently inevitable waging of war by governments, is why he is considered a philosophical anarchist.\n\nLater, various versions of \"Tolstoy's Bible\" were published, indicating the passages Tolstoy most relied on, specifically, the reported words of Jesus himself.<ref>Orwin, Donna T. ''The Cambridge Companion to Tolstoy''. Cambridge University Press, 2002</ref>\n\n[[File:Gandhi Tolstoy Farm.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]] and other residents of [[Tolstoyan movement#Africa|Tolstoy Farm]], South Africa, 1910]]\n\nTolstoy believed that a true Christian could find lasting happiness by striving for inner perfection through following the [[Great Commandment]] of loving one's neighbor and God, rather than guidance from the Church or state. Another distinct attribute of his philosophy based on Christ's teachings is [[nonresistance]] during conflict. This idea in Tolstoy's ''book [[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' (full text of English translation [[s:The Kingdom of God Is Within You|available on Wikisource]]) directly influenced [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and therefore also nonviolent resistance movements to this day.\n\nTolstoy believed that the aristocracy was a burden on the poor, and that the only way to live together is [[Christian anarchism|anarchism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} He opposed [[private property|private]] land ownership<ref>I Cannot Be Silent.

Philosopher [[Peter Kropotkin]] wrote of Tolstoy in the article on anarchism in the ''[[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'':<blockquote>Without naming himself an anarchist, Leo Tolstoy, like his predecessors in the popular religious movements of the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd|Chojecki]], [[Hans Denck|Denk]] and many others, took the anarchist position as regards the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[property right]]s, deducing his conclusions from the general spirit of the teachings of Jesus and from the necessary dictates of reason. With all the might of his talent, Tolstoy made (especially in ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'') a powerful criticism of the church, the state and law altogether, and especially of the present [[property law]]s. He describes the state as the domination of the wicked ones, supported by brutal force. Robbers, he says, are far less dangerous than a well-organized government. He makes a searching criticism of the prejudices which are current now concerning the benefits conferred upon men by the church, the state, and the existing distribution of property, and from the teachings of Jesus he deduces the rule of non-resistance and the absolute condemnation of all wars. His religious arguments are, however, so well combined with arguments borrowed from a dispassionate observation of the present evils, that the anarchist portions of his works appeal to the religious and the non-religious reader alike.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition |last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Kropotkin |year=1911 |publisher= New York : Encyclopaedia Britannica|location= |isbn= |page=918 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri01chisrich#page/918/mode/2up |accessdate= |quote=Anarchism}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Tolstoy organising famine relief in Samara, 1891.jpg|thumb|left|Tolstoy organising [[Russian famine of 1891\u201392|famine relief]] in Samara, 1891]]\nTolstoy denounced the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] intervention in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China,<ref name=\"Orwin2002\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SC9suBt-Vm4C&pg=PA37&dq=Tolstoy+boxers#v=onepage&q=Tolstoy%20boxers|title=The Cambridge Companion to Tolstoy|author=Donna Tussing Orwin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-521-52000-3|pages=37\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Tolstoy(graf)1978\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2TVgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Tolstoy+boxers&q=Boxer#search_anchor|title=Tolstoy's Letters: 1880\u20131910|author1=Leo Tolstoy|author2=Leo Tolstoy (graf)|author3=Reginald Frank Christian|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group, Limited|year=1978|isbn=978-0-485-71172-1|page=580}}</ref> the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], and the [[Second Boer War]] between the [[British Empire]] and the Boer republics.<ref>Apollon Davidson, Irina Filatova.

Chertkov (bald man with the beard and mustache); and students.]]\n\nIn hundreds of essays over the last 20 years of his life, Tolstoy reiterated the anarchist critique of the state and recommended books by [[Kropotkin]] and [[Proudhon]] to his readers, while rejecting anarchism's espousal of [[propaganda of the deed|violent revolutionary means]]. In the 1900 essay, \"On Anarchy\", he wrote: \"The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be instituted by a revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power ... There can be only one permanent revolution\u2014a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.\" Despite his misgivings about [[anarchist violence]], Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of [[anarchism in Russia|anarchist thinkers in Russia]], and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin's \"Words of a Rebel\", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.<ref>''[[Peter Kropotkin: From Prince to Rebel]]''.

Both performers were nominated for [[Academy Award|Oscars]] for their roles.

In 1901, the American travel lecturer [[Burton Holmes]] visited Yasnaya Polyana with [[Albert J. Beveridge]], the U.S. senator and historian. As the three men conversed, Holmes filmed Tolstoy with his 60-mm movie camera. Afterwards, Beveridge's advisers succeeded in having the film destroyed, fearing that the meeting with the Russian author might hurt Beveridge's chances of running for the U.S. presidency.<ref>Wallace, Irving, 'Everybody's Rover Boy', in ''The Sunday Gentleman''.

Others who followed the same path were [[Alexander Herzen]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]]. During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy witnessed a public execution in Paris, a traumatic experience that marked the rest of his life.

Tolstoy read Hugo's newly finished ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''. The similar evocation of battle scenes in Hugo's novel and Tolstoy's ''[[War and Peace]]'' indicates this influence. Tolstoy's political philosophy was also influenced by a March 1861 visit to French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], then living in exile under an assumed name in Brussels. Tolstoy reviewed Proudhon's forthcoming publication, ''La Guerre et la Paix'' (\"''War and Peace''\" in French), and later used the title for his masterpiece. The two men also discussed education, as Tolstoy wrote in his educational notebooks: \"If I recount this conversation with Proudhon, it is to show that, in my personal experience, he was the only man who understood the significance of education and of the printing press in our time.\"\n\nFired by enthusiasm, Tolstoy returned to Yasnaya Polyana and founded 13 schools for the children of Russia's peasants, who had just been [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipated from serfdom in 1861]].

Though he later rejected them as sentimental, a great deal of Tolstoy's own life is revealed. They retain their relevance as accounts of the universal story of growing up.\n\nTolstoy served as a [[second lieutenant]] in an artillery regiment during the [[Crimean War]], recounted in his ''[[Sevastopol Sketches]]''.

''Anna Karenina'' (1877) tells parallel stories of an adulterous woman trapped by the conventions and falsities of society and of a philosophical landowner (much like Tolstoy), who works alongside the peasants in the fields and seeks to reform their lives. Tolstoy not only drew from his own life experiences but also created characters in his own image, such as Pierre Bezukhov and Prince Andrei in ''War and Peace'', Levin in ''Anna Karenina'' and to some extent, Prince Nekhlyudov in ''Resurrection''.\n\n{{Multiple image\n | header = ''[[The Power of Darkness]]''\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer = 2015 at Vienna's [[Akademietheater]]\n | image1 = Die Macht der Finsternis 2354-Peralta.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 =\n | image2 =Die Macht der Finsternis 2417-Peralta.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 =\n | image3 =Die Macht der Finsternis 2465-Peralta.jpg\n | alt3 =\n | caption3 =\n}}\n''War and Peace'' is generally thought to be one of the greatest novels ever written, remarkable for its dramatic breadth and unity. Its vast canvas includes 580 characters, many historical with others fictional. The story moves from family life to the headquarters of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], from the court of [[Alexander I of Russia]] to the battlefields of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]]. Tolstoy's original idea for the novel was to investigate the causes of the [[Decembrist revolt]], to which it refers only in the last chapters, from which can be deduced that [[Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky|Andrei Bolkonsky]]'s son will become one of the Decembrists. The novel explores Tolstoy's theory of history, and in particular the insignificance of individuals such as Napoleon and Alexander. Somewhat surprisingly, Tolstoy did not consider ''War and Peace'' to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written at that time to be novels). This view becomes less surprising if one considers that Tolstoy was a novelist of the [[realism (arts)|realist]] school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life.<ref>Tolstoy and the Development of Realism. G Lukacs. ''Marxists on Literature: An Anthology'', London: Penguin, 1977</ref> ''War and Peace'' (which is to Tolstoy really an [[Epic poetry|epic]] in prose) therefore did not qualify. Tolstoy thought that ''Anna Karenina'' was his first true novel.<ref>''Tolstoy and the Novel''. J Bayley \u2013 1967 \u2013 Chatto & Windus</ref>\n\nAfter ''Anna Karenina'', Tolstoy concentrated on Christian themes, and his later novels such as ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich'' (1886) and ''[[What Is to Be Done? (Tolstoy)|What Is to Be Done?]]'' develop a radical [[anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifist]] Christian philosophy which led to his [[excommunication]] from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1901.<ref>''Church and State''. L Tolstoy&nbsp;\u2013 On Life and Essays on Religion, 1934</ref> For all the praise showered on ''Anna Karenina'' and ''War and Peace'', Tolstoy rejected the two works later in his life as something not as true of reality.<ref>''Women in Tolstoy: the ideal and the erotic'' R.C. Benson \u2013 1973 \u2013 University of Illinois Press</ref>\n\nIn his novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'', Tolstoy attempts to expose the injustice of man-made laws and the hypocrisy of institutionalized church. Tolstoy also explores and explains the economic philosophy of [[Georgism]], of which he had become a very strong advocate towards the end of his life.\n\nTolstoy also tried himself in poetry with several soldier songs written during his military service and fairy tales in verse such as ''Volga-bogatyr'' and ''Oaf'' stylized as national folk songs. They were written between 1871 and 1874 for his ''Russian Book for Reading'', a collection of short stories in four volumes (total of 629 stories in various genres) published along with the ''New Azbuka'' textbook and addressed to schoolchildren. Nevertheless, he was skeptical about poetry as a genre. As he famously said, \"Writing poetry is like ploughing and dancing at the same time\". According to [[Valentin Bulgakov]], he criticised poets, including [[Alexander Pushkin]], for their \"false\" epithets used \"simply to make it rhyme\".<ref>''Leo Tolstoy (1874)''.

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], who died thirty years before Tolstoy's death, thought him the greatest of all living novelists. [[Gustave Flaubert]], on reading a translation of ''War and Peace'', exclaimed, \"What an artist and what a psychologist!\" [[Anton Chekhov]], who often visited Tolstoy at his country estate, wrote, \"When literature possesses a Tolstoy, it is easy and pleasant to be a writer; even when you know you have achieved nothing yourself and are still achieving nothing, this is not as terrible as it might otherwise be, because Tolstoy achieves for everyone. What he does serves to justify all the hopes and aspirations invested in literature.\" The 19th-century British poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] opined that \"A novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life.\"<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nLater novelists continued to appreciate Tolstoy's art, but sometimes also expressed criticism. [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] wrote \"I am attracted by his earnestness and by his power of detail, but I am repelled by his looseness of construction and by his unreasonable and impracticable mysticism.\"<ref name=\"ACD\">{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=Arthur Conan|title=My Favourite Novelist and His Best Book|date= January 1898|location=London|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1306981h.html|accessdate=6 October 2017}}</ref> [[Virginia Woolf]] declared him \"the greatest of all novelists.\"<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> [[James Joyce]] noted that \"He is never dull, never stupid, never tired, never pedantic, never theatrical!\" [[Thomas Mann]] wrote of Tolstoy's seemingly guileless artistry: \"Seldom did art work so much like nature.\" [[Vladimir Nabokov]] heaped superlatives upon ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'' and ''Anna Karenina''; he questioned, however, the reputation of ''War and Peace'', and sharply criticized ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' and ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata]]''.\n\n== Religious and political beliefs ==\n{{anarchism sidebar}}\n[[File:Ilya Repin - Leo Tolstoy Barefoot - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Tolstoy dressed in peasant clothing, by [[Ilya Repin]] (1901)]]\nAfter reading [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: \"Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I've never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer\".<ref>Tolstoy's Letter to A.A. Fet, 30 August 1869</ref>\n\nIn Chapter VI of ''[[A Confession]]'', Tolstoy quoted the final paragraph of Schopenhauer's work. It explains how a complete [[self-denial|denial of self]] causes only a relative nothingness which is not to be feared. Tolstoy was struck by the description of Christian, [[Buddhist]], and [[Hindu]] ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness. After reading passages such as the following, which abound in Schopenhauer's ethical chapters, the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will: <blockquote> But this very necessity of involuntary suffering (by poor people) for [[eternal salvation]] is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior ([[Matthew 19:24]]): \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\" Therefore, those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation, chose [[simple living|voluntary poverty]] when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in wealth. Thus [[Buddha]] [[Sakyamuni]] was born a prince, but voluntarily took to the mendicant's staff; and [[Francis of Assisi]], the founder of the [[mendicant orders]] who, as a youngster at a ball, where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together, was asked: \"Now Francis, will you not soon make your choice from these beauties?\" and who replied: \"I have made a far more beautiful choice!\" \"Whom?\" \"''La povert\u00e0'' (poverty)\": whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a mendicant.<ref>Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. II, \u00a7&nbsp;170</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1884, Tolstoy wrote a book called ''What I Believe'', in which he openly confessed his Christian beliefs. He affirmed his belief in [[Jesus Christ]]'s [[Teachings of Jesus|teachings]] and was particularly influenced by the [[Sermon on the Mount]], and the injunction to [[turn the other cheek]], which he understood as a \"commandment of non-resistance to evil by force\" and a doctrine of [[pacifism]] and [[nonviolence]]. In his work ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'', he explains that he considered mistaken the Church's doctrine because they had made a \"perversion\" of Christ's teachings. Tolstoy also received letters from American [[Quakers]] who introduced him to the non-violence writings of Quaker Christians such as [[George Fox]], [[William Penn]] and [[Jonathan Dymond]]. Tolstoy believed being a Christian required him to be a pacifist; the apparently inevitable waging of war by governments, is why he is considered a philosophical anarchist.\n\nLater, various versions of \"Tolstoy's Bible\" were published, indicating the passages Tolstoy most relied on, specifically, the reported words of Jesus himself.<ref>Orwin, Donna T.

Gandhi]] and other residents of [[Tolstoyan movement#Africa|Tolstoy Farm]], South Africa, 1910]]\n\nTolstoy believed that a true Christian could find lasting happiness by striving for inner perfection through following the [[Great Commandment]] of loving one's neighbor and God, rather than guidance from the Church or state. Another distinct attribute of his philosophy based on Christ's teachings is [[nonresistance]] during conflict. This idea in Tolstoy's ''book [[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' (full text of English translation [[s:The Kingdom of God Is Within You|available on Wikisource]]) directly influenced [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and therefore also nonviolent resistance movements to this day.\n\n\nTolstoy believed that the aristocracy was a burden on the poor, and that the only way to live together is [[Christian anarchism|anarchism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} He opposed [[private property|private]] land ownership<ref>I Cannot Be Silent.

Philosopher [[Peter Kropotkin]] wrote of Tolstoy in the article on anarchism in the ''[[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'':<blockquote>Without naming himself an anarchist, Leo Tolstoy, like his predecessors in the popular religious movements of the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd|Chojecki]], [[Hans Denck|Denk]] and many others, took the anarchist position as regards the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[property right]]s, deducing his conclusions from the general spirit of the teachings of Jesus and from the necessary dictates of reason. With all the might of his talent, Tolstoy made (especially in ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'') a powerful criticism of the church, the state and law altogether, and especially of the present [[property law]]s. He describes the state as the domination of the wicked ones, supported by brutal force. Robbers, he says, are far less dangerous than a well-organized government. He makes a searching criticism of the prejudices which are current now concerning the benefits conferred upon men by the church, the state, and the existing distribution of property, and from the teachings of Jesus he deduces the rule of non-resistance and the absolute condemnation of all wars. His religious arguments are, however, so well combined with arguments borrowed from a dispassionate observation of the present evils, that the anarchist portions of his works appeal to the religious and the non-religious reader alike.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition |last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Kropotkin |year=1911 |publisher= New York : Encyclopaedia Britannica|location= |isbn= |page=918 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri01chisrich#page/918/mode/2up |accessdate= |quote=Anarchism}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Tolstoy organising famine relief in Samara, 1891.jpg|thumb|left|Tolstoy organising [[Russian famine of 1891\u201392|famine relief]] in Samara, 1891]]\nTolstoy denounced the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] intervention in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China,<ref name=\"Orwin2002\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SC9suBt-Vm4C&pg=PA37&dq=Tolstoy+boxers#v=onepage&q=Tolstoy%20boxers|title=The Cambridge Companion to Tolstoy|author=Donna Tussing Orwin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-521-52000-3|pages=37\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Tolstoy(graf)1978\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2TVgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Tolstoy+boxers&q=Boxer#search_anchor|title=Tolstoy's Letters: 1880\u20131910|author1=Leo Tolstoy|author2=Leo Tolstoy (graf)|author3=Reginald Frank Christian|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group, Limited|year=1978|isbn=978-0-485-71172-1|page=580}}</ref> the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], and the [[Second Boer War]] between the [[British Empire]] and the Boer republics.<ref>Apollon Davidson, Irina Filatova.

Both performers were nominated for [[Academy Award|Oscars]] for their roles. There have been other films about the writer, including ''[[Departure of a Grand Old Man]]'', made in 1912 just two years after his death, ''How Fine, How Fresh the Roses Were'' (1913), and ''Leo Tolstoy'', directed by and starring [[Sergei Gerasimov (film director)|Sergei Gerasimov]] in 1984.\n\nThere is also a famous [[lost film]] of Tolstoy made a decade before he died. In 1901, the American travel lecturer [[Burton Holmes]] visited Yasnaya Polyana with [[Albert J. Beveridge]], the U.S. senator and historian. As the three men conversed, Holmes filmed Tolstoy with his 60-mm movie camera. Afterwards, Beveridge's advisers succeeded in having the film destroyed, fearing that the meeting with the Russian author might hurt Beveridge's chances of running for the U.S. presidency.<ref>Wallace, Irving, 'Everybody's Rover Boy', in ''The Sunday Gentleman''.

It is situated in the district of [[Dhubri]] ([[Assam]]). There are some sayings about the origin of the name of AGOMANI. Agomani derives from the word '''\"AGOMAN\"'''which means arrival. It is said that Mahapurush Sri Sri  Shankardeva, the great preacher of the Bhagawati Bhaishnava faith, made a voyage from Pathbaushi with his niece Aai Bhubeneshwari to get her marriage with Chillarai, the brother of Nara Narayana, the king of Koch kingdom. They made a journey by boat on the river Ganghadhar. Both of them arrived at Agomani Ghat and received each other. From that time the place was named Agomani. Later Shankardeva and Chilarai came to Satrasal where marriage ceremony of Aai Bhubeneshwari with Chilarai was performed. (which is controversial)\nThere are other sayings that Raja Probhat Ch. Baruah, the Jamindar of Gouripur and Maharaja Nara Narayana, the King of Koch kingdom arrived at the place of Agomani to meet and to settle some disputes overland. To commemorate that historical meeting, the place has been known as Agomani.\n\n== Demographics ==\nAgomani is a thickly populated area. Most of the inhabitants are cultivators. There are some service holders and Business men also. Cultivators produced rice, jute, wheat, vegetable and other agricultural crops. But the economic condition of the general people of Agomani is good. This is due to the fact that the most of the people belong to the backward classes. Residences of Agomani are mostly Hindus and Muslims. They are peace-loving people and have been living in communal harmony and peace since long ago. There was no record of communal disturbances at Agomani.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cic.nic.in/cicwebpages/Assam/agomani/festival.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233455/http://www.cic.nic.in/cicwebpages/Assam/agomani/festival.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cic.nic.in/cicwebpages/Assam/agomani/frame3.html |title=\"Agomani Development Block\" |access-date=26 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052309/http://www.cic.nic.in/cicwebpages/Assam/agomani/frame3.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Sheelbhadra the famous Assamese writer, wrote a novel namely \"AGOMANIR GHAT\" which made Agomani well known.\n\n== Facilities ==\nThere are several Govt.

It is an area on the bank of [[Gangadhar River]] with historical significance. Agomani stands in a rural area, but it is not a revenue village. Some portions of the village of Kaldoba and Shernagar formed the small area of Agomani. The area of Agomani is about 4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> Agomani is situated at a distance of 50&nbsp;km to the North West of [[Dhubri]], 12&nbsp;km to the South of West Bengal border and 8&nbsp;km to the North East of Bangladesh border. [[National Highway 17 (India)|National Highway 17]] passes through Agomani from North to South and the historical [[Gohain Kamal Ali]] (Road) runs from East to West. Both the roads crossed it the heart of Agomani. At the conjunction, there is a daily market and shops of all kinds are established.

He played a major role in the development of the [[activated sludge process]] for biological [[wastewater treatment]] in sewage treatment plants and the establishment of an infrastructure for treatment and disposal of municipal and industrial wastewater. Further fields of his broad spectrum of activities included the training of operating personnel of wastewater treatment plants. He initiated the establishment of corresponding training networks and participated in their organisation in a leading position. His work provided the central basis for concepts of water protection and for maintaining and improving water quality.\n\n== Life ==\nWilhelm von der Emde was born in [[Kassel]] / Germany. Interrupted by military service, he studied civil engineering at the [[Technical University of Hanover]] (Technische Hochschule Hannover) from 1940 to 1948. From 1949 to the end of 1952 he worked in Dietrich Kehr's engineering office, from 1953 to 1958 he was assistant and senior engineer at the Institute for Urban Water Management at the Technical University of Hannover (Director: Dietrich Kehr)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oewav.at/Page.aspx?target=391572|title=\u00d6WAV News, 03.03.2020|last=|first=|date=|website=oewav.at|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>, where he received his doctorate on 10 July 1957.\n\nIn his dissertation<ref>Wilhelm v.d. Emde: ''Beitrag zu Versuchen zur Abwasserreinigung mit belebtem Schlamm'', published by the Institute for Urban Water Management of the Technical University of Hanover, Hannover, 1957</ref>, he described the state of the art of the methodology for dimensioning wastewater treatment plants at that time and developed a new procedure to calculate the oxygen consumption and excess sludge production of aeration plants, which is still used today in a slightly modified form. In the following years (1958-1964) he worked as head of the department of wastewater treatment plants at Stadtentw\u00e4sserung Hamburg. Overlapping (from 1960 to 1964) he was a lecturer at the Technical University of Braunschweig and from April 1961 onward he also lectured at the Technical University of Delft. During a stay in England (Manchester) he met William T. Lockett, one of the inventors of the activated sludge process. In 1914 Lockett, together with Edward Ardern, had invented the activated sludge process based on the work of [[Gilbert John Fowler]].<ref>Edward Ardern, William T Lockett: ''Experiments of the oxidation of sewage without the aid of filters'', Journal of the Society of Chemical Industries, (1914) 33, 523\u2013539</ref>\n\nIn 1960, at the suggestion of the World Health Organisation ([[WHO]]) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ([[OECD]]), with the participation of the Technical University of Delft and the Netherlands Universities Foundation for International Cooperation ([[Nuffic]]), the \"European Course in Sanitary Engineering\", today IHE Delft ([[UNESCO-IHE]]) was established. Wilhelm von der Emde was a full-time lecturer at this research and educational institution from 1962 until 1964 when he accepted a position at the [[TU Wien]]. There he founded the Institute for Water Supply, Wastewater Treatment and Water Pollution Control (today: Institute for Water Quality and Resource Management), which he headed from 1 October 1964 until his retirement on 1 October 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iwr.tuwien.ac.at/wasser/kontakt/institutsbeschreibung/|title=Institutsbeschreibung iwr, TU Wien|last=|first=|date=|website=tuwien.at|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWilhelm von der Emde died on 19 February 2020 at the age of 98 in [[Baden (Nieder\u00f6sterreich)|Baden]] / Vienna.<ref>Bezirksblatt Baden, 04/05 March 2020, p. 49</ref>\n\n== Work and achivements ==\nDuring his work at Hamburg's municipal wastewater treatment company ([[Hamburger Stadtentw\u00e4sserung]]), he was significantly involved in the planning of the [[Kl\u00e4ranlage K\u00f6hlbrandh\u00f6ft|K\u00f6hlbrandh\u00f6ft]] wastewater treatment plant, the first large-scale plant with high-load biology.<ref>Wilhelm Hosang, Wolfgang Bischof, Abwassertechnik. 1998, II. neubearbeitete Auflage, Springer, S. 483</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, Wilhelm von der Emde, together with [[Rolf Kayser (Wasserbauingenieur)|Rolf Kayser]] (later holder of the chair for urban water management at [[TU Braunschweig]]), planned the Blumental wastewater treatment plant in Vienna, which went into operation in 1969.<ref>Wilhelm v.d. Emde: ''Die Kl\u00e4ranlage Wien-Blumental'', \u00d6sterr. Wasserwirtschaft 23 (1971) 11\u201318</ref> This plant attracted great international attention, as it was one of the first large-scale plants in the world to be able to remove not only organic contaminants but also nitrogen compounds to a large extent in the same tank by biological means.<ref>Norbert Matsch\u00e9: ''The Elimination of Nitrogen in the Treatment Plant of Vienna-Blumental'', Water Research 6 (1972), iss. 4-5, 485\u2013486</ref> Also, essential parts of the functional concept of the later main wastewater treatment plant in Vienna ([[Hauptkl\u00e4ranlage Wien]]), which went into operation in 1980 and was extended in 2005, are based on the work of Wilhelm von der Emde.<ref>Wilhelm v.d. Emde: ''Gedanken zur Erweiterung der Hauptkl\u00e4ranlage Wien Simmering'', \u00d6sterr. Wasserwirtschaft 38 (1986), 198\u2013207</ref>\n\nVon der Emde recognised very early on, that the objectives of water protection can only be achieved if pollution by industrial wastewater is largely avoided. Under his leadership, the institute, therefore, dealt intensively with the treatment and disposal of wastewater from leather, pulp<ref>Hellmut Fleckseder: ''Beitrag zur Reinigung der Abw\u00e4sser aus der Sulfitzellstofferzeugung'', Dissertation 1973, TU Wien</ref> and sugar production<ref>Helmut Kroiss: ''Ein Beitrag zur Reinigung von Zuckerfabriksabwasser'', Dissertation 1978, TU Wien</ref> as well as the chemical industry, which were responsible for a substantial part of the pollution of water bodies in Austria. In many cases, new wastewater treatment processes were developed from laboratory tests to the operation of large-scale plants. A typical example is a process developed in the 1980s for the purification of wastewater from citric acid production by the company [[Jungbunzlauer]] in Pernhofen (Lower Austria).<ref>Helmut Kroiss: ''Anaerobe Abwasserreinigung'', Wiener Mitteilungen, Band 62, Wien, 1988</ref> The central part of the solution to this problem is the anaerobic pre-treatment of the concentrated wastewater, which takes place in an upflow sludge bed reactor with a rotary distributor (EKJ reactor). As a joint project together with his successor at TU Wien, [[Helmut Kroiss]], this device was patented in 1983).<ref>Patent DE 3324072 C2: ''Apparatus for anaerobic waste water treatment.'' 1983 [https://patents.google.com/patent/DE3324072C2/en?oq=ininventor:Dr-Ing+Wilhelm+Von+Der+Emde(google.at)]</ref>\n\nIn the field of river basin management, Wilhelm von der Emde researched the relationship between wastewater treatment and water quality. In practice, the results led to improved water protection and a considerable increase in water quality, not only in Austria. For example, acted the \"Danube Expert Report\", the content of which led to the \"Danube Regulation\", as a tool to legally anchor biological wastewater treatment in Austria.<ref>Wilhelm v. d. Emde, Hellmut Fleckseder: ''Grundsatzkonzept \u00fcber die Gew\u00e4sserg\u00fcte der \u00f6sterreichischen Donaustrecke \u2013 Wasserg\u00fctewirtschaftliche Entwicklungen, Zielsetzungen und Anforderungen'', report on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic of Austria, Vienna, December 1975</ref>\n\nEqually exemplary was the work of Wilhelm von der Emde and his team in reducing and preventing the eutrophication of water bodies. The main focus here was the avoidance of phosphorus inputs into Lake Constance and Lake Neusiedl. The measures initiated and implemented were extremely successful and are internationally regarded as a milestone in the field of water protection.<ref>W.v.d.Emde, N. Matsche, F.

He played a major role in the development of the [[activated sludge process]] for biological [[wastewater treatment]] in sewage treatment plants and the establishment of an infrastructure for treatment and disposal of municipal and industrial wastewater. Further fields of his broad spectrum of activities included the training of operating personnel of wastewater treatment plants. He initiated the establishment of corresponding training networks and participated in their organisation in a leading position. His work provided the central basis for concepts of water protection and for maintaining and improving water quality.\n\n== Life ==\nWilhelm von der Emde was born in [[Kassel]] / Germany. Interrupted by military service, he studied civil engineering at the [[Technical University of Hanover]] (Technische Hochschule Hannover) from 1940 to 1948. From 1949 to the end of 1952 he worked in Dietrich Kehr's engineering office, from 1953 to 1958 he was assistant and senior engineer at the Institute for Urban Water Management at the Technical University of Hannover (Director: Dietrich Kehr)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oewav.at/Page.aspx?target=391572|title=\u00d6WAV News, 03.03.2020|last=|first=|date=|website=oewav.at|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>, where he received his doctorate on 10 July 1957.\n\nIn his dissertation<ref>Wilhelm v.d. Emde: ''Beitrag zu Versuchen zur Abwasserreinigung mit belebtem Schlamm'', published by the Institute for Urban Water Management of the Technical University of Hanover, Hannover, 1957</ref>, he described the state of the art of the methodology for dimensioning wastewater treatment plants at that time and developed a new procedure to calculate the oxygen consumption and excess sludge production of aeration plants, which is still used today in a slightly modified form. In the following years (1958-1964) he worked as head of the department of wastewater treatment plants at Stadtentw\u00e4sserung Hamburg. Overlapping (from 1960 to 1964) he was a lecturer at the Technical University of Braunschweig and from April 1961 onward he also lectured at the Technical University of Delft. During a stay in England (Manchester) he met William T. Lockett, one of the inventors of the activated sludge process. In 1914 Lockett, together with Edward Ardern, had invented the activated sludge process based on the work of [[Gilbert John Fowler]].<ref>Edward Ardern, William T Lockett: ''Experiments of the oxidation of sewage without the aid of filters'', Journal of the Society of Chemical Industries, (1914) 33, 523\u2013539</ref>\n\nIn 1960, at the suggestion of the World Health Organisation ([[WHO]]) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ([[OECD]]), with the participation of the Technical University of Delft and the Netherlands Universities Foundation for International Cooperation ([[Nuffic]]), the \"European Course in Sanitary Engineering\", today IHE Delft ([[UNESCO-IHE]]) was established. Wilhelm von der Emde was a full-time lecturer at this research and educational institution from 1962 until 1964 when he accepted a position at the [[TU Wien]]. There he founded the Institute for Water Supply, Wastewater Treatment and Water Pollution Control (today: Institute for Water Quality and Resource Management), which he headed from 1 October 1964 until his retirement on 1 October 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iwr.tuwien.ac.at/wasser/kontakt/institutsbeschreibung/|title=Institutsbeschreibung iwr, TU Wien|last=|first=|date=|website=tuwien.at|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWilhelm von der Emde died on 19 February 2020 at the age of 98 in [[Baden (Nieder\u00f6sterreich)|Baden]] / Vienna.<ref>Bezirksblatt Baden, 04/05 March 2020, p. 49</ref>\n\n== Work and achivements ==\nDuring his work at Hamburg's municipal wastewater treatment company ([[Hamburger Stadtentw\u00e4sserung]]), he was significantly involved in the planning of the [[Kl\u00e4ranlage K\u00f6hlbrandh\u00f6ft|K\u00f6hlbrandh\u00f6ft]] wastewater treatment plant, the first large-scale plant with high-load biology.<ref>Wilhelm Hosang, Wolfgang Bischof, Abwassertechnik. 1998, II. neubearbeitete Auflage, Springer, S. 483</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, Wilhelm von der Emde, together with [[Rolf Kayser (Wasserbauingenieur)|Rolf Kayser]] (later holder of the chair for urban water management at [[TU Braunschweig]]), planned the Blumental wastewater treatment plant in Vienna, which went into operation in 1969.<ref>Wilhelm v.d. Emde: ''Die Kl\u00e4ranlage Wien-Blumental'', \u00d6sterr. Wasserwirtschaft 23 (1971) 11\u201318</ref> This plant attracted great international attention, as it was one of the first large-scale plants in the world to be able to remove not only organic contaminants but also nitrogen compounds to a large extent in the same tank by biological means.<ref>Norbert Matsch\u00e9: ''The Elimination of Nitrogen in the Treatment Plant of Vienna-Blumental'', Water Research 6 (1972), iss. 4-5, 485\u2013486</ref> Also, essential parts of the functional concept of the later main wastewater treatment plant in Vienna ([[Hauptkl\u00e4ranlage Wien]]), which went into operation in 1980 and was extended in 2005, are based on the work of Wilhelm von der Emde.<ref>Wilhelm v.d. Emde: ''Gedanken zur Erweiterung der Hauptkl\u00e4ranlage Wien Simmering'', \u00d6sterr. Wasserwirtschaft 38 (1986), 198\u2013207</ref>\n\nVon der Emde recognised very early on, that the objectives of water protection can only be achieved if pollution by industrial wastewater is largely avoided. Under his leadership, the institute, therefore, dealt intensively with the treatment and disposal of wastewater from leather, pulp<ref>Hellmut Fleckseder: ''Beitrag zur Reinigung der Abw\u00e4sser aus der Sulfitzellstofferzeugung'', Dissertation 1973, TU Wien</ref> and sugar production<ref>Helmut Kroiss: ''Ein Beitrag zur Reinigung von Zuckerfabriksabwasser'', Dissertation 1978, TU Wien</ref> as well as the chemical industry, which were responsible for a substantial part of the pollution of water bodies in Austria. In many cases, new wastewater treatment processes were developed from laboratory tests to the operation of large-scale plants. A typical example is a process developed in the 1980s for the purification of wastewater from citric acid production by the company [[Jungbunzlauer]] in Pernhofen (Lower Austria).<ref>Helmut Kroiss: ''Anaerobe Abwasserreinigung'', Wiener Mitteilungen, Band 62, Wien, 1988</ref> The central part of the solution to this problem is the anaerobic pre-treatment of the concentrated wastewater, which takes place in an upflow sludge bed reactor with a rotary distributor (EKJ reactor). As a joint project together with his successor at TU Wien, [[Helmut Kroiss]], this device was patented in 1983).<ref>Patent DE 3324072 C2: ''Apparatus for anaerobic waste water treatment.'' 1983 [https://patents.google.com/patent/DE3324072C2/en?oq=ininventor:Dr-Ing+Wilhelm+Von+Der+Emde(google.at)]</ref>\n\nIn the field of river basin management, Wilhelm von der Emde researched the relationship between wastewater treatment and water quality. In practice, the results led to improved water protection and a considerable increase in water quality, not only in Austria. For example, acted the \"Danube Expert Report\", the content of which led to the \"Danube Regulation\", as a tool to legally anchor biological wastewater treatment in Austria.<ref>Wilhelm v. d. Emde, Hellmut Fleckseder: ''Grundsatzkonzept \u00fcber die Gew\u00e4sserg\u00fcte der \u00f6sterreichischen Donaustrecke \u2013 Wasserg\u00fctewirtschaftliche Entwicklungen, Zielsetzungen und Anforderungen'', report on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic of Austria, Vienna, December 1975</ref>\n\nEqually exemplary was the work of Wilhelm von der Emde and his team in reducing and preventing the eutrophication of water bodies. The main focus here was the avoidance of phosphorus inputs into Lake Constance and Lake Neusiedl. The measures initiated and implemented were extremely successful and are internationally regarded as a milestone in the field of water protection.<ref>W.v.d.Emde, N. Matsche, F.
