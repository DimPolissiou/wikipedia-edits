It was built in 1922 when District 30 became C2, the second consolidation in Jefferson County. An adjacent white masonry building was built in 1944 for the high school and the first class graduated from the newly christened high school in 1948.<ref>[http://www.co.jefferson.co.us/placenames/search3.cfm?ps_oid=112404&search= Evergreen School, Third One] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928125429/http://www.co.jefferson.co.us/placenames/search3.cfm?ps_oid=112404&search= |date=2007-09-28 }}.

Highlighted are the [[Nucleobase|nucleobases]] (green) and the ribose-phosphate backbone (blue). This is a single strand of RNA that folds back upon itself. ]]\n\n'''Ribonucleic acid''' ('''RNA''') is a [[polymer]]ic molecule essential in various biological roles in [[Genetic code|coding]], [[Translation (biology)|decoding]], [[Regulatory RNA|regulation]] and [[RNA splicing|expression]] of [[gene]]s. RNA and [[DNA]] are [[nucleic acid]]s, and, along with [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s, constitute the four major [[macromolecule]]s essential for all known forms of [[life]]. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of [[nucleotide]]s, but unlike DNA, RNA is found in nature as a single strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double strand. Cellular organisms use [[messenger RNA]] ('''''mRNA''''') to convey genetic information (using the [[nucleobase|nitrogenous bases]] of [[guanine]], [[uracil]], [[adenine]], and [[cytosine]], denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many [[virus]]es encode their genetic information using an RNA [[genome]].\n\nSome RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling [[gene expression]], or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], a universal function in which RNA molecules direct the synthesis of proteins on [[ribosome]]s. This process uses [[transfer RNA]] ('''''tRNA''''') molecules to deliver [[amino acid]]s to the ribosome, where [[ribosomal RNA]] ('''''rRNA''''') then links amino acids together to form coded proteins.\n\n==Comparison with DNA==\n[[File:50S-subunit of the ribosome 3CC2.png|thumb|Three-dimensional representation of the [[50S]] ribosomal subunit.

RNA and [[DNA]] are [[nucleic acid]]s, and, along with [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s, constitute the four major [[macromolecule]]s essential for all known forms of [[life]]. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of [[nucleotide]]s, but unlike DNA, RNA is found in nature as a single strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double strand. Cellular organisms use [[messenger RNA]] ('''''mRNA''''') to convey genetic information (using the [[nucleobase|nitrogenous bases]] of [[guanine]], [[uracil]], [[adenine]], and [[cytosine]], denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many [[virus]]es encode their genetic information using an RNA [[genome]].\n\nSome RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling [[gene expression]], or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], a universal function in which RNA molecules direct the synthesis of proteins on [[ribosome]]s. This process uses [[transfer RNA]] ('''''tRNA''''') molecules to deliver [[amino acid]]s to the ribosome, where [[ribosomal RNA]] ('''''rRNA''''') then links amino acids together to form coded proteins.\n\n==Comparison with DNA==\n[[File:50S-subunit of the ribosome 3CC2.png|thumb|Three-dimensional representation of the [[50S]] ribosomal subunit.
