{"title_page": "Carlos (Calusa)", "text_new": "[[File:Flmn chiefshut.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Diorama of Carlos (center) and his court at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]]]]\n'''Carlos''', also known as '''Calos''' or '''King Calusa''' (died 1567), was king or [[paramount chief]] of the [[Calusa]] people of [[Southwest Florida]] from about 1556 until his death. As his father and predecessor was also known as Carlos, he is sometimes called '''Carlos II'''. Carlos ruled over one of the most powerful and prosperous [[chiefdom]]s in the region at the time, controlling the coastal areas of southwest Florida and wielding influence throughout the southern peninsula. Contemporary Europeans recognized him as the most powerful chief in Florida.\n\nCarlos inherited the throne from his father, who had been installed as regent while the designated heir, Felipe, was too young to rule. Carlos' father bypassed Felipe in favor of Carlos, creating tension between Carlos and Felipe's families. Felipe served as war chief and was seen as a stronger leader by many Calusa.\n\nCarlos was chief at the time of contact with the Spanish under [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s]] in 1566. At this time, Carlos faced internal political pressure from Felipe as well as war with external enemies, most notably the [[Tocobaga]] around [[Tampa Bay]]. As a result, he initially sought an alliance with the Spanish. The alliance soon failed due to the conflicting aims of the two parties, and the relationship between the Calusa and the Spanish turned violent. Eventually Carlos was captured and executed by Spanish officers. Felipe succeeded him as chief.\n\n==Background and succession==\n[[File:FLMap-Calusa-core&domain.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Approximate Calusa core territory (red) and sphere of influence (blue) in Carlos' time]]\n\nDuring Carlos' time, the Calusa were a major power in Florida.

[[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]] says ''Senquene'' was the name of Carlos II's father and predecessor (Hann 5). However, Lewis (32) and Marquardt (104\u2013106) refer to the original king (Carlos II's father's brother) as \"Senquene\". Goggin and Sturtevant, Widmer, and McGoun follow Fontaneda in giving Senquene as the name of Carlos II's father.</ref> Their sister was married to the war chief (a position known to the Spanish as \"captain general\") with whom she had a son, who was eventually known to the Spanish as Felipe. The king had no sons of his own. As the Calusa, unusually among [[Southeastern tribes]], apparently practiced [[patrilineal succession]], the king named Felipe his heir. He formally adopted Felipe and married him to his daughter. However, the king died while Felipe was still too young to rule. Senquene and Felipe's father agreed that Senquene should rule temporarily until Felipe came of age. After Senquene took the kingship, Carlos was born. Senquene reneged on his vow to step down; he named Carlos his successor and had the previous king's daughter divorced from Felipe and remarried to Carlos. He placated Felipe's enraged family by naming Felipe the next captain general and arranging a marriage to one of his own daughters. This development caused unease for many Calusa, who saw it as a usurpation.<ref name=McGoun16/><ref>Hann 267\u2013269.</ref><ref name=Widmer6>Widmer 1988:6.</ref>\n\nCarlos II had an older sister, later baptized Antonia, whom he loved greatly. By the time of contact with the Spanish, Antonia was one of Carlos' wives (according to Spanish reports Calusa chiefs were expected to take their sister as one of their wives). His queen or principal wife, whose name is unknown, was the sister of Felipe.<ref name=Widmer6/> Carlos had several other wives, many of whom were daughters of his [[vassal|vassal chiefs]].<ref>McGoun 1993: 34.</ref>\n\n==Kingship==\nCarlos likely rose to the kingship in the 1550s; William Marquart suggests 1556 based on events that happened that year. Carlos' succession evidently inspired challenges from other powerful chiefdoms. In 1556, the daughter of Oathchaqua, chief of the [[Ais people|Ais]] of [[Cape Canaveral]], set out for Calusa to cement an alliance between their peoples by marrying Carlos. During the journey, she was captured by the chief of the [[Surruque]] or Serrope, who took her as his own wife. In doing so, Chief Surruque challenged Carlos' authority, disrupted the key alliance and trading route between the Calusa and Ais, and positioned himself as a significant power. A few years later, the [[Tocobaga]] of [[Tampa Bay]] asserted themselves by capturing twelve Calusa nobles, including the sister of Carlos' wife. Beset with problems, Carlos struggled to respond.<ref>Marquardt 1987:106</ref>\n\nCarlos was king at the time of contact with the Spanish under [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s]]. Avil\u00e9s arrived in the Calusa region in 1565, five weeks after establishing the settlement of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in northeast Florida and ejecting the French [[Huguenot]]s from their settlement of [[Fort Caroline]]. The Spanish landed at Carlos' capital, Calos, probably on [[Mound Key]], in September of that year.<ref>McGoun 1993: 9.</ref> Men\u00e9ndez' primary goal in the voyage was to secure the release of Spanish shipwreck survivors living among the Calusa, including his son Juan.<ref>McGoun, p. 9\u201311.</ref>\n\nCarlos jumped at the chance for an alliance with the powerful foreigners. He hoped such an alliance would help against his people's enemies, in particular the Tocabaga. He also may have hoped it would give him the upper hand in his rivalry with Felipe, whom the Spanish chronicler Gonzalo Sol\u00eds de Mer\u00e1s wrote was even more feared by his people than Carlos himself.<ref>McGoun, p. 12.</ref> According to historian Stephen Edward Reilly, this power struggle was the primary reason Carlos pursued an alliance with the Spanish.<ref>McGoun, pp. 12\u201313.</ref>\n\nCarlos attempted to solidify the alliance with the Spanish by offering to wed his sister Antonia to Men\u00e9ndez, who very reluctantly accepted. He allowed the Spanish to establish a small outpost and a [[Jesuit]] mission, [[San Ant\u00f3n de Carlos]], near the main town of Calos.<ref name=McGoun14>McGoun, p. 14.</ref> He also sent several prominent Calusa, including Felipe, a certain Sebastian, and Sebastian's son Pedro (relatives of Carlos), on a trip to [[Havana]]. However, relations with the Spanish soon soured. Carlos did reluctantly release his captive shipwreck survivors, but was angered when Men\u00e9ndez refused to aid him against the Tocobaga. He was further dismayed when Men\u00e9ndez put off consummating his marriage to Antonia (Sol\u00eds de Mer\u00e1s is unclear as to whether they ever consummated the union).<ref>McGoun, p. 13.</ref>\n\n==Death and aftermath==\nThereafter, the relationship took a violent turn, as Carlos repeatedly plotted against the Spanish. He attempted three times to assassinate Men\u00e9ndez. After Men\u00e9ndez's departure, the Calusa were continuously hostile towards the Spanish outpost and its commander, Francisco de Reinoso. Reinoso wanted to fight back, but was prevented from doing so by Father Juan de Rogel, who led Mission San Ant\u00f3n. In Spring 1567, Reinoso managed to compel Rogel to journey to Havana, allowing him to strike against the Calusa. Reinoso had Carlos captured and killed, along with his advisers, and installed Felipe in his place.<ref name=\"McGoun14\"/>\n\nFelipe proved a stronger king than Carlos, and therefore a greater danger to the Spanish. Though he appeased the Spanish by ostensibly converting to Christianity, he did not abandon the traditional religious practice or the power it afforded him. In 1569, the Calusa attacked the landing party of [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez]]. Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez repelled the attack and had Felipe and twenty of his supporters killed. Pedro, whom Spanish sources call Carlos' \"first cousin\", succeeded Felipe as chief of the Calusa. Pedro was no more compliant than his predecessors had been, and the Spanish abandoned the region.<ref>McGoun, pp. 15\u201316 and note.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last= Goggin |first= John M. |author-link=John Mann Goggin|last2= Sturtevant |first2= William C.|author-link2=William C.

It features the origin of the Fantastic Four and the team's first battle with the evil [[Doctor Doom]]. Executive-produced by low-budget specialist [[Roger Corman]] and [[Bernd Eichinger]], the film was ultimately [[List of unproduced Marvel Comics projects|never released officially]], but illegal copies began circulating after a few years.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom]] are college friends who use the opportunity of a passing comet to try an experiment; however, the experiment goes wrong, leaving Victor believed dead. [[Invisible Woman|Susan]] and [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] are two children living with their mother, who has a boarding house where Reed lives. [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]] is a family friend and a college buddy of Reed's.\n\nTen years later, Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben go up into an experimental spacecraft of Reed's as the same comet passes by Earth. They are hit by cosmic rays from it, due to a necessary diamond being exchanged for an imitation by the Jeweler.\n\nUpon crash-landing on Earth, the four discover that the cosmic rays gave them [[Superpower (ability)|special powers]]: Reed's bodily structure has become elastic, Sue can become invisible, Johnny can generate fire on demand and Ben has transformed into a creature with stone-like skin: the Thing. They are later captured by Victor's men, who pose as Marines, and meet villainous monarch Dr. Doom. After escaping from Doom's men, the four regroup at the [[Baxter Building]], trying to decide what to do now that they have gained superpowers. An angry Ben leaves the group to go out on his own, feeling he has become a freak of nature. He is found by homeless men and joins them in the lair of the Jeweler.\n\nThe Jeweler has his henchmen kidnap blind artist [[Alicia Masters]], whom he plans to force into being his bride and intends to use the stolen diamond as his wedding gift to her. Doom has his own plans for the diamond and sends his henchmen to the Jeweler's lair to make a deal with him, to no avail. Doom, displeased, seizes the diamond himself as a gun battle breaks out between The Jeweler's and Doom's men. Ben enters the fray, only for Doom to take Alicia as his hostage. Ben threatens to 'clobber' Doom, only for Alicia to beg his not to risk it and confesses her love for him. Her confession reverts Ben to human form, causing him to flee out onto the city streets. Frustrated at his helplessness, he reverts to the Thing.\n\nBen returns to his friends; by now, Reed has learned that Doom is actually Victor. Doom contacts them and threatens to use the diamond to power a laser cannon that will destroy [[New York City]], unless they surrender to him. Realizing they are the only ones who can stop Doom, they don costumes and travel to Doom's castle. There, the Fantastic Four battle a series of Doom's military. Doom fires his laser as Reed has a final battle with him, which ends with Doom being knocked off a balcony wall. He manages to grab hold of the wall and Reed attempts to rescue him, only for Doom's gauntlet to come loose and him falling into the fog below. His gauntlet, still on the balcony, starts to move on its own. Johnny becomes the Human Torch and flies off to stand between the laser's shot and the city, pushing the beam into outer space. Ben frees Alicia and finally introduces himself to her. She feels the rocky surface of his face but is not fazed by his altered appearance. Thereafter, the Four dedicate themselves to fighting evil, and Reed and Sue marry.\n\n==Cast ==\n* [[Alex Hyde-White]] as [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic]]\n* [[Rebecca Staab]] as [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm-Richards / Invisible Woman]]\n** [[Mercedes McNab]] as Young Sue Storm\n* [[Jay Underwood]] as [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm / Human Torch]]\n** [[Phillip Van Dyke]] as Young Johnny Storm\n* [[Michael Bailey Smith]] as Ben Grimm\n** [[Carl Ciarfalio]] as [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]\n* [[Joseph Culp]] as [[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom]]\n* [[Kat Green]] as [[Alicia Masters]]\n* [[Ian Trigger]] as The Jeweler\n* [[George Gaynes]] as Professor\n* Annie Gagen as May Storm\n\n==Production==\nIn 1983, German producer [[Bernd Eichinger]] met with [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Stan Lee]] at Lee's [[Los Angeles]] home to explore obtaining an option for a movie based on the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref name=itop109>{{cite news | title = Fantastic Faux! | first = Robert | last = Ito | work = [[Los Angeles (magazine)|Los Angeles]] | date = March 2005 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=SF8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA109&dq=%22selling+the+character's+option+to+Universal%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FJbjUPe3KMy70AHlwoDAAw&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22selling%20the%20character's%20option%20to%20Universal%22&f=false 109] }}</ref> The option was not available until three years later, when Eichinger's production company [[Constantin Film]] obtained it for a price the producer called \"not enormous\" and which has been estimated to be $250,000.<ref name=Itop110>Ito, p.

It features the origin of the Fantastic Four and the team's first battle with the evil [[Doctor Doom]]. Executive-produced by low-budget specialist [[Roger Corman]] and [[Bernd Eichinger]], the film was ultimately [[List of unproduced Marvel Comics projects|never released officially]], but illegal copies began circulating after a few years.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom]] are college friends who use the opportunity of a passing comet to try an experiment; however, the experiment goes wrong, leaving Victor believed dead. [[Invisible Woman|Susan]] and [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] are two children living with their mother, who has a boarding house where Reed lives. [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]] is a family friend and a college buddy of Reed's.\n\nTen years later, Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben go up into an experimental spacecraft of Reed's as the same comet passes by Earth. They are hit by cosmic rays from it, due to a necessary diamond being exchanged for an imitation by the Jeweler.\n\nUpon crash-landing on Earth, the four discover that the cosmic rays gave them [[Superpower (ability)|special powers]]: Reed's bodily structure has become elastic, Sue can become invisible, Johnny can generate fire on demand and Ben has transformed into a creature with stone-like skin: the Thing. They are later captured by Victor's men, who pose as Marines, and meet villainous monarch Dr. Doom. After escaping from Doom's men, the four regroup at the [[Baxter Building]], trying to decide what to do now that they have gained superpowers. An angry Ben leaves the group to go out on his own, feeling he has become a freak of nature. He is found by homeless men and joins them in the lair of the Jeweler.\n\nThe Jeweler has his henchmen kidnap blind artist [[Alicia Masters]], whom he plans to force into being his bride and intends to use the stolen diamond as his wedding gift to her. Doom has his own plans for the diamond and sends his henchmen to the Jeweler's lair to make a deal with him, to no avail. Doom, displeased, seizes the diamond himself as a gun battle breaks out between The Jeweler's and Doom's men. Ben enters the fray, only for Doom to take Alicia as his hostage. Ben threatens to 'clobber' Doom, only for Alicia to beg his not to risk it and confesses her love for him. Her confession reverts Ben to human form, causing him to flee out onto the city streets. Frustrated at his helplessness, he reverts to the Thing.\n\nBen returns to his friends; by now, Reed has learned that Doom is actually Victor. Doom contacts them and threatens to use the diamond to power a laser cannon that will destroy [[New York City]], unless they surrender to him. Realizing they are the only ones who can stop Doom, they don costumes and travel to Doom's castle. There, the Fantastic Four battle a series of Doom's military. Doom fires his laser as Reed has a final battle with him, which ends with Doom being knocked off a balcony wall. He manages to grab hold of the wall and Reed attempts to rescue him, only for Doom's gauntlet to come loose and him falling into the fog below. His gauntlet, still on the balcony, starts to move on its own. Johnny becomes the Human Torch and flies off to stand between the laser's shot and the city, pushing the beam into outer space. Ben frees Alicia and finally introduces himself to her. She feels the rocky surface of his face but is not fazed by his altered appearance. Thereafter, the Four dedicate themselves to fighting evil, and Reed and Sue marry.\n\n==Cast ==\n* [[Alex Hyde-White]] as [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic]]\n* [[Rebecca Staab]] as [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm-Richards / Invisible Woman]]\n** [[Mercedes McNab]] as Young Sue Storm\n* [[Jay Underwood]] as [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm / Human Torch]]\n** [[Phillip Van Dyke]] as Young Johnny Storm\n* [[Michael Bailey Smith]] as Ben Grimm\n** [[Carl Ciarfalio]] as [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]\n* [[Joseph Culp]] as [[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom]]\n* [[Kat Green]] as [[Alicia Masters]]\n* [[Ian Trigger]] as The Jeweler\n* [[George Gaynes]] as Professor\n* Annie Gagen as May Storm\n\n==Production==\nIn 1983, German producer [[Bernd Eichinger]] met with [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Stan Lee]] at Lee's [[Los Angeles]] home to explore obtaining an option for a movie based on the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref name=itop109>{{cite news | title = Fantastic Faux! | first = Robert | last = Ito | work = [[Los Angeles (magazine)|Los Angeles]] | date = March 2005 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=SF8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA109&dq=%22selling+the+character's+option+to+Universal%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FJbjUPe3KMy70AHlwoDAAw&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22selling%20the%20character's%20option%20to%20Universal%22&f=false 109] }}</ref> The option was not available until three years later, when Eichinger's production company [[Constantin Film]] obtained it for a price the producer called \"not enormous\" and which has been estimated to be $250,000.<ref name=Itop110>Ito, p.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=aU0hCAS2-08C&pg=RA1-PA224 \"Indian Temple Architecture.\"] At Google Books. Accessed 30 March 2009.</ref> The temple was built on a stepped plan. It had an open hall and sanctuary, now in ruins. The sculptural decoration included flowers, garlands, torana, animals, birds and deities. It was especially elaborate in the upper portion of the walls. The temple walls are also decorated with thin [[pilaster]]s. The open hall has lathe turned pillars.\n\n===Veerabhadra Temple===\nThe Veerabhadra temple is also located at the Hangal fort. Although highly decorated, it is in need of restoration work.<ref>[http://www.shaivam.org/siddhanta/spka.htm \"Karnataka Temples.\"] Shaivam.org Accessed 12 January 2009.</ref>\n\n===Billeshwara Temple===\n[[File:Hangal Billeshwara temple 1.JPG|180px|thumb|right|Billeshwara temple]]\nThe Billeshwara temple is in the [[Hoysala]] style. This temple has elaborately carved jambs on the doorframe of the ''garbhagudi''. At the bottom of each side, there are five carved figures. [[Manmatha]] is in the central projection. [[Rati]] is at his side. [[Daksha]] (the goat headed deity) is also present and all are flanked by attendants. The temple has a sanctuary face which is incomplete. The temple outer walls are decorated with designs of temple towers and carved diamond shaped depressions. The square panels show carved serpents with intertwined tails, animals, musicians, and foliage.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-color:transparent; background: transparent; width: 100%;

The urbanized area around Corbin extends into [[Laurel County, Kentucky|Laurel County]]; this area is not incorporated into the city limits due to a state law prohibiting cities from being in more than two counties, but it is served by some of the city's public services. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city population was 7,304, with 21,132 living in the \"[[Urbanized Area|urban cluster]]\" that includes King Corbin and [[North King Corbin, Kentucky|North King Corbin]]. King Corbin is on [[Interstate 75 in Kentucky|Interstate 75]], about halfway between [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Col Sanders Restaurant.png|left|thumb|200px|The [[Harland Sanders Caf\u00e9 and Museum]]]]\nThe first settlement in the Corbin area was known as Lynn Camp Station and the first post office was called Cummins, for community founder Nelson Cummins. It was discovered in 1885 that both Cummins and Lynn Camp were already in use as names for Kentucky post offices and postmaster James Eaton was asked to select another name. He chose Corbin, for the Rev. James Corbin Floyd, a local minister.<ref>''Corbin-Times Tribune'', 1906. James Eaton is quoted as saying he named the town for Rev. Floyd, \"the finest man I know.\"</ref> The town was incorporated under that name in 1905.\n\nCorbin has a troubled racial past, including a [[Corbin, Kentucky race riot of 1919|race riot in late October 1919]] in which a white mob forced nearly all the town's 200 black residents onto a freight train out of town, and a [[sundown town]] policy until the late 20th century.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7772527 NPR].</ref> The event is the subject of a 1991 documentary, ''Trouble Behind''.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Corbin has a total area of {{convert|7.9|mi2|abbr=on}}, with only a tiny fraction of {{convert|0.044|mi2|abbr=on}}, or 0.56%, consisting of water.\n\nCorbin lies in the [[Cumberland Plateau]] region of [[Appalachia]] in southeastern Kentucky, along [[Interstate 75 in Kentucky|Interstate 75]] and [[U.S. Route 25W]]. I-75 provides access to the city from exit 25, leading north 89 miles (143 km) to [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] and south 86 miles (138 km) to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Tennessee]]. U.S. 25W runs through the center of town, leading north 14 miles (23 km) to [[London, Kentucky|London]] (via [[U.S. Route 25 in Kentucky|U.S. Route 25]]) and south 21 miles (34 km) to [[Williamsburg, Kentucky|Williamsburg]].  \n\nThe Pine Mountain Overthrust Fault, a [[geologic fault]] system several miles to the east, produces occasional [[earthquake|tremors]], the most recent in 2008.\n\n===Climate===\nCorbin exhibits a [[humid subtropical climate]], typical of southeastern [[Kentucky]]. The region experiences four distinct seasons. Winters are cool to cold, with mild periods. Summers are generally hot and humid, with variable spring and fall seasons. Precipitation is common year round, but more prevalent in the summer months. Corbin's climate is somewhat moderated by the surrounding mountains. \n \n{{Weather box \n|location = Corbin, Kentucky\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 74\n|Feb record high F = 81\n|Mar record high F = 87\n|Apr record high F = 90\n|May record high F = 91\n|Jun record high F = 98\n|Jul record high F = 101\n|Aug record high F = 102\n|Sep record high F = 97\n|Oct record high F = 92\n|Nov record high F = 82\n|Dec record high F = 78\n|year record high F = 102\n|Jan high F = 44\n|Feb high F = 49\n|Mar high F = 58\n|Apr high F = 68\n|May high F = 75\n|Jun high F = 83\n|Jul high F = 86\n|Aug high F = 85\n|Sep high F = 79\n|Oct high F = 69\n|Nov high F = 58\n|Dec high F = 48\n|year high F = 66.8\n|Jan low F = 25\n|Feb low F = 28\n|Mar low F = 36\n|Apr low F = 43\n|May low F = 52\n|Jun low F = 61\n|Jul low F = 66\n|Aug low F = 64\n|Sep low F = 57\n|Oct low F = 44\n|Nov low F = 36\n|Dec low F = 29\n|year low F = 45\n|Jan record low F = \u221225\n|Feb record low F = \u221211\n|Mar record low F = \u221212\n|Apr record low F = 19\n|May record low F = 28\n|Jun record low F = 34\n|Jul record low F = 45\n|Aug record low F = 44\n|Sep record low F = 32\n|Oct record low F = 18\n|Nov record low F = 2\n|Dec record low F = \u221217\n|year record low F = \u221225\n|Jan precipitation inch = 4.01\n|Feb precipitation inch = 3.72\n|Mar precipitation inch = 4.61\n|Apr precipitation inch = 4.01\n|May precipitation inch = 4.69\n|Jun precipitation inch = 4.24\n|Jul precipitation inch = 4.39\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.36\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.37\n|Oct precipitation inch = 2.80\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.90\n|Dec precipitation inch = 4.31\n|year precipitation inch = 47.41\n|source 1 = [[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]].<ref name=climate>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/USKY0797=month_bottomnav_undeclared\n|title=MONTHLY AVERAGES for Corbin, KY|publisher=[[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]]|accessdate=May 27, 2010}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1900= 1544\n|1910= 2589\n|1920= 3406\n|1930= 8036\n|1940= 7893\n|1950= 7744\n|1960= 7119\n|1970= 7474\n|1980= 8075\n|1990= 7419\n|2000= 7742\n|2010= 7304\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=7261\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[File:London KY MSA.png|thumb|right|250px|Location of the London MSA]]\n\nCorbin is in the [[London, Kentucky micropolitan area]], whose current boundaries were established in 2013 by the U.S. [[Office of Management and Budget]] in coordination with the [[United States Census Bureau]].<ref name=\"OMB_10-02\">{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b-13-01.pdf |title=OMB Bulletin No. 13-01: Revised Delineations of Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and Combined Statistical Areas, and Guidance on Uses of the Delineations of These Areas |publisher=[[United States Office of Management and Budget]] |date=February 28, 2013 |accessdate=February 20, 2016}}</ref> Previously, the London micropolitan area had consisted solely of Laurel County, while the Whitley County portion of Corbin was the principal city of its own micropolitan area that consisted solely of that county.

NIBROC often features free performances by popular musical acts such as [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[Joan Jett and The Blackhearts]], [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]], [[Foghat]], [[Jefferson Starship|Starship]], [[Percy Sledge]], [[The Turtles]], and [[The Marshall Tucker Band]]. In episode 10 of the American reality-documentary television series ''[[On the Road with Austin & Santino]]'' on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] entitled \"We Love a Parade\", the fashion designers visit Corbin to custom-design a dress for a local woman participating in the NIBROC parade.\n\nDespite being in [[Dry county|dry counties]] ([[Knox County, Kentucky|Knox]] and [[Whitley County, Kentucky|Whitley]]), the city of Corbin allows full retail alcohol sales, following a successful local option election on February 14, 2012. The city had previously voted in 2004 to allow sales of alcohol by the drink in larger restaurants.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thetimestribune.com/x913137168/Corbin-says-Yes |title=Corbin says 'Yes' |first=Jeff |last=Noble |newspaper=[[The Times-Tribune (Corbin, Kentucky)|The Times-Tribune]] |location=Corbin, Kentucky |date=February 15, 2012 |access-date=April 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nCorbin has an association with [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], having been the location of the chain's first restaurant, opened in 1930. Corbin appears in the animated cartoon ''South Park''{{'}}s episode \"Medicinal Fried Chicken\", wherein [[Eric Cartman]] visits the town to meet with Harland Sanders. Corbin is depicted as located in a lush rain forest in parody of the 1983 film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', wherein [[Tony Montana]] and Omar Suarez visit [[Bolivia]] to meet with a drug kingpin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimestribune.com/features/x993485348/Corbin-gets-mention-in-South-Park-episode|title=Corbin gets mention in 'South Park' episode|work=The Times-Tribune.com|access-date=July 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Government==\nCorbin is governed by a mayor and [[city commission]]; along with a city manager who runs the day-to-day operations of the departments; currently Marlon Sams is city manager. Since it does not have a mayor/alderman form of government, Corbin is considered home rule-class under Kentucky's city classification system that took effect in 2015. Susie Razmus is the current mayor. Trent Knuckles, David Grigsby Hart, Ed Tye, and Andrew Pennington are its four current commissioners.{{when|date=March 2018}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thetimestribune.com/elections/x691733682/Shelton-Tye-re-elected-Joe-White-loses-seat|title=Shelton, Tye re-elected, Joe White loses seat|work=The Times-Tribune.com|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCorbin is one of the few cities in Kentucky that lie in two counties\u2014Whitley and Knox. Many built-up areas in neighboring Laurel County have a Corbin postal address but lie outside the city limits. This arrangement has created some problems with taxes and census records. The city receives a portion of the occupational tax collected in Whitley County, but Knox County has refused to give Corbin any tax collected there. On March 10, 2008, the City Commission voted to file a lawsuit against Knox County to receive a portion of the tax collected within city limits.<ref>{{cite news |title=Corbin to sue Knox County. |date=March 11, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Times-Tribune (Corbin)|Times-Tribune]] |last=Swindler |first=Samantha |page=1A}}</ref> On May 23, 2014, the Kentucky Court of Appeals ruled that the \"Stivers amendment\", passed as part of KY HB 499 \"Tax Amnesty\" legislation in 2012, did not violate the state's constitution. The measure essentially canceled the effect of court rulings that would have enabled Corbin to keep all the revenue from the tax generated inside the city limits. Corbin's mayor, Willard McBurney, vowed to carry the fight to the state Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Knuckles|first1=Trent|title=Corbin loses occupational tax case appeal|url=http://thenewsjournal.net/details.cfm?id=8228|accessdate=July 17, 2015|work=The News Journal|date=June 11, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717045341/http://thenewsjournal.net/details.cfm?id=8228#comments|archivedate=July 17, 2015|location=Corbin, KY, USA}}</ref>\n\nCorbin is in [[Kentucky's 5th congressional district]].\n\n==Education==\nCorbin, like many communities of its size in southeastern Kentucky, has an independent school system (in Kentucky, a [[Public education|public school]] system not affiliated with a county; most such districts are associated with individual cities). The district was officially established in 1916 and the 100th class graduated in 2017. The [[Corbin Independent School District]] includes:\n* Corbin Preschool Center\n* Corbin Primary (grades K-2) (Currently housed by newest building in the district that was rebuilt entirely)\n* Corbin Elementary (grades 3-4)\n* Corbin Intermediate (grades 5-6) \n* Corbin Middle (grades 7-8) (Currently housed by oldest building in the district) \n* [[Corbin High School|Corbin High]] (grades 9-12)  \n* Corbin Vocational School\n* Corbin new middle school at the former St. Camillus location opened for students August 2018 (grades 6-8)\n\nThe community and school system place considerable emphasis on the success of academics and high school athletic teams. Corbin \"Redhound\" sports are important social events within the community.\n\nIn 2004, [[Eastern Kentucky University]] opened an extension campus in Corbin.\n\nThe annual ''Battle for the Brass Lantern'', a college football rivalry game between the [[University of the Cumberlands]] and [[Union College (Kentucky)|Union College]], was played at Corbin High School's stadium in 2006 and 2007, as a neutral field roughly equidistant from the two campuses.

Established in 1908 by the Sisters of Divine Providence, the school has been successful as both a boarding school for national and international students and as a [[Montessori]] school. Its original schoolhouse, built in 1913, was demolished in summer 2008. The new school building is still situated atop a prominent hill overlooking the town, providing a striking backdrop to the streets of downtown Corbin. The school closed in 2012 after 99 years of service. The property and grounds of the school were sold to the Corbin School System to house a new Corbin Middle School due to rapidly increasing student population and age of the current building.\n\nCorbin has a [[public library|lending library]], the Corbin Public Library.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://kdla.ky.gov/librarians/pages/librarydirectory.aspx | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111202017/https://kdla.ky.gov/librarians/pages/librarydirectory.aspx | url-status=dead | archive-date=11 January 2019 | title=Kentucky Public Library Directory | publisher=Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives | accessdate=7 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\nCorbin straddles [[Interstate 75 (Kentucky)|Interstate 75]] and [[U.S. Route 25 in Kentucky|U.S. Highway 25]] (which splits into [[US 25E (KY)|US 25E]] and [[US 25W (KY)|US 25W]] in North Corbin).

The urbanized area around Corbin extends into [[Laurel County, Kentucky|Laurel County]]; this area is not incorporated into the city limits due to a state law prohibiting cities from being in more than two counties, but it is served by some of the city's public services. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city population was 7,304, with 21,132 living in the \"[[Urbanized Area|urban cluster]]\" that includes Corbin and [[North Corbin, Kentucky|North Corbin]]. Corbin is on [[Interstate 75 in Kentucky|Interstate 75]], about halfway between [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Col Sanders Restaurant.png|left|thumb|200px|The [[Harland Sanders Caf\u00e9 and Museum]]]]\nThe first settlement in the Corbin area was known as Lynn Camp Station and the first post office was called Cummins, for community founder Nelson Cummins. It was discovered in 1885 that both Cummins and Lynn Camp were already in use as names for Kentucky post offices and postmaster James Eaton was asked to select another name. He chose Corbin, for the Rev. James Corbin Floyd, a local minister.<ref>''Corbin-Times Tribune'', 1906. James Eaton is quoted as saying he named the town for Rev. Floyd, \"the finest man I know.\"</ref> The town was incorporated under that name in 1905.\n\nCorbin has a troubled racial past, including a [[Corbin, Kentucky race riot of 1919|race riot in late October 1919]] in which a white mob forced nearly all the town's 200 black residents onto a freight train out of town, and a [[sundown town]] policy until the late 20th century.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7772527 NPR].</ref> The event is the subject of a 1991 documentary, ''Trouble Behind''.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Corbin has a total area of {{convert|7.9|mi2|abbr=on}}, with only a tiny fraction of {{convert|0.044|mi2|abbr=on}}, or 0.56%, consisting of water.\n\nCorbin lies in the [[Cumberland Plateau]] region of [[Appalachia]] in southeastern Kentucky, along [[Interstate 75 in Kentucky|Interstate 75]] and [[U.S. Route 25W]]. I-75 provides access to the city from exit 25, leading north 89 miles (143 km) to [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] and south 86 miles (138 km) to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Tennessee]]. U.S. 25W runs through the center of town, leading north 14 miles (23 km) to [[London, Kentucky|London]] (via [[U.S. Route 25 in Kentucky|U.S. Route 25]]) and south 21 miles (34 km) to [[Williamsburg, Kentucky|Williamsburg]].  \n\nThe Pine Mountain Overthrust Fault, a [[geologic fault]] system several miles to the east, produces occasional [[earthquake|tremors]], the most recent in 2008.\n\n===Climate===\nCorbin exhibits a [[humid subtropical climate]], typical of southeastern [[Kentucky]]. The region experiences four distinct seasons. Winters are cool to cold, with mild periods. Summers are generally hot and humid, with variable spring and fall seasons. Precipitation is common year round, but more prevalent in the summer months.

The [[population density]] was 920.1 people per square mile (355.3/km\u00b2). There were 3,507 housing units at an average density of 441.8 per square mile (170.6/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 97.41% [[White American|White]] (96.69% [[Non-Hispanic whites|non-Hispanic]]), 0.26% [[African American]], 0.31% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] or [[Alaska Natives|Alaska Native]], 0.64% [[Asian American|Asian]], 0.26% from [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census#Race|other races]], and 1.11% from [[Multiracial American|two or more races]].

[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics or Latinos]] of any race were 1.19% of the population.\n\nThere were 3,093 households out of which 29.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 16.0% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.2% had a male householder with no wife present, and 38.5% were non-families. 34.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 16.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.27 and the average family size was 2.91.\n\nThe age distribution was 22.5% under 18, 8.5% from 18 to 24, 22.9% from 25 to 44, 25.3% from 45 to 64, and 20.8% who were 65 or older.

While the railroad (presently [[CSX]]) continues to play an important role, the decline of the rail industry in the latter half of the 20th century, as well as the loss of some manufacturing jobs, has prompted the community to begin diversifying its economy.\n\n==Culture==\nEach year in early August, Corbin hosts a festival called NIBROC (''Corbin'' spelled backwards) featuring open-air concerts, carnival attractions, a beauty pageant, parade, and other events. The festival is featured, if anachronistically, in the play ''Last Train to Nibroc'' by [[Arlene Hutton]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2007/04/11/theater/reviews/11tril.html?_r=0|title=Three Plays Portray a Couple Bound by Love and Conflict|newspaper=New York Times|first= Ginia |last=Bellafante|date=April 11, 2007}}</ref> (Though the play is set in the 1940s, the festival itself only dates to 1952.)

In episode 10 of the American reality-documentary television series ''[[On the Road with Austin & Santino]]'' on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] entitled \"We Love a Parade\", the fashion designers visit Corbin to custom-design a dress for a local woman participating in the NIBROC parade.\n\nDespite being in [[Dry county|dry counties]] ([[Knox County, Kentucky|Knox]] and [[Whitley County, Kentucky|Whitley]]), the city of Corbin allows full retail alcohol sales, following a successful local option election on February 14, 2012.

Since it does not have a mayor/alderman form of government, Corbin is considered home rule-class under Kentucky's city classification system that took effect in 2015.

Many built-up areas in neighboring Laurel County have a Corbin postal address but lie outside the city limits. This arrangement has created some problems with taxes and census records. The city receives a portion of the occupational tax collected in Whitley County, but Knox County has refused to give Corbin any tax collected there. On March 10, 2008, the City Commission voted to file a lawsuit against Knox County to receive a portion of the tax collected within city limits.<ref>{{cite news |title=Corbin to sue Knox County. |date=March 11, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Times-Tribune (Corbin)|Times-Tribune]] |last=Swindler |first=Samantha |page=1A}}</ref> On May 23, 2014, the Kentucky Court of Appeals ruled that the \"Stivers amendment\", passed as part of KY HB 499 \"Tax Amnesty\" legislation in 2012, did not violate the state's constitution.

The district was officially established in 1916 and the 100th class graduated in 2017. The [[Corbin Independent School District]] includes:\n* Corbin Preschool Center\n* Corbin Primary (grades K-2) (Currently housed by newest building in the district that was rebuilt entirely)\n* Corbin Elementary (grades 3-4)\n* Corbin Intermediate (grades 5-6) \n* Corbin Middle (grades 7-8) (Currently housed by oldest building in the district) \n* [[Corbin High School|Corbin High]] (grades 9-12)  \n* Corbin Vocational School\n* Corbin new middle school at the former St. Camillus location opened for students August 2018 (grades 6-8)\n\nThe community and school system place considerable emphasis on the success of academics and high school athletic teams. Corbin \"Redhound\" sports are important social events within the community.\n\nIn 2004, [[Eastern Kentucky University]] opened an extension campus in Corbin.\n\nThe annual ''Battle for the Brass Lantern'', a college football rivalry game between the [[University of the Cumberlands]] and [[Union College (Kentucky)|Union College]], was played at Corbin High School's stadium in 2006 and 2007, as a neutral field roughly equidistant from the two campuses.

Established in 1908 by the Sisters of Divine Providence, the school has been successful as both a boarding school for national and international students and as a [[Montessori]] school. Its original schoolhouse, built in 1913, was demolished in summer 2008. The new school building is still situated atop a prominent hill overlooking the town, providing a striking backdrop to the streets of downtown Corbin. The school closed in 2012 after 99 years of service. The property and grounds of the school were sold to the Corbin School System to house a new Corbin Middle School due to rapidly increasing student population and age of the current building.\n\nCorbin has a [[public library|lending library]], the Corbin Public Library.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://kdla.ky.gov/librarians/pages/librarydirectory.aspx | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111202017/https://kdla.ky.gov/librarians/pages/librarydirectory.aspx | url-status=dead | archive-date=11 January 2019 | title=Kentucky Public Library Directory | publisher=Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives | accessdate=7 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\nCorbin straddles [[Interstate 75 (Kentucky)|Interstate 75]] and [[U.S. Route 25 in Kentucky|U.S. Highway 25]] (which splits into [[US 25E (KY)|US 25E]] and [[US 25W (KY)|US 25W]] in North Corbin).
