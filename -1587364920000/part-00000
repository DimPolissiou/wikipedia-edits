Born in [[Sunderland]], England, Wight lived in Glasgow during his childhood and teenage years. After graduating from [[Glasgow Veterinary College]] in 1939, Wight moved back to England and was a veterinarian in the [[Yorkshire Dales]] for almost fifty years. He used this experience to write a series of eight books set in 1930s\u20131950s England about animals and their owners. He is best known for these semi-autobiographical works, which began with ''If Only They Could Talk'', published in 1970.\n\nThere have been multiple television and film adaptions of Wight's books, including the 1975 film ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (film)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' and the [[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|BBC television series of the same name]], which ran for a total of 90 episodes.\n\n==Personal life==\nJames Alfred Wight was born on 3 October 1916 in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], [[County Durham]], England to James (1890\u20131960) and Hannah Bell (1890\u20131980) Wight.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/james-herriot-9336867 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226215236/http://www.biography.com/people/james-herriot-9336867 |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 February 2012 |title=James Herriot Biography |website=Biography.com |accessdate=5 December 2015 }}</ref> Shortly after their wedding, the Wights moved from Brandling Street, Sunderland, to [[Glasgow]], Scotland, where James took work as a ship plater and as a pianist for a local cinema, while Hannah was a singer and a dressmaker.<ref name=\"memoir\">Wight, Jim. 2000.

Two years later, in 1930, he decided to become a veterinarian after the principal of [[Glasgow Veterinary College]] gave a lecture at his high school.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Herriot |first1=James |title=James Herriot's Dog Stories |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-92558-1 |pages=xi\u2013xii}}</ref> Wight studied for six years at Glasgow Veterinary College, and qualified as a veterinary surgeon in December 1939 at age 23.<ref name=\"tti\"/>\n\nWight's first position, which he accepted in January 1940, was at a veterinary practice in Sunderland. He moved to work in a rural practice the following July, based at 23 Kirkgate in [[Thirsk]], Yorkshire, near the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and [[North York Moors]]. The practice owner, [[Donald Sinclair (veterinarian)|Donald Sinclair]], had enlisted in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and needed someone to look after the practice while he was away. He offered Wight a salaried partnership in the practice, which was an excellent position at that time for a young veterinarian with little experience.

He joined his wife at her parents' house, where she had lived since he left Thirsk. They lived there until the summer of 1945, when they moved back to 23 Kirkgate after Sinclair and his wife moved to another location. In May 1949, Wight obtained a full partnership with Sinclair.{{r|memoir|p=162}} In 1953, the family moved to a house on Topcliffe Road, Thirsk, opposite the secondary school.

At that time, books written by veterinary surgeons were considered advertisements of their services, so Wight took \"James Herriot\" as his pen name after seeing Scottish goalkeeper [[Jim Herriot]] play for [[Birmingham City F.C.]] in a televised game against [[Manchester United F.C.]]. ''If Only They Could Talk'' was published in the United Kingdom in 1970 by [[Michael Joseph Ltd]], but sales were slow until [[Thomas McCormack (writer)|Thomas McCormack]] of [[St. Martin's Press]] in New York City received a copy and arranged to have the first two books published as a single volume in the United States. Wight named the volume ''All Creatures Great and Small'' from the second line of the hymn \"[[All Things Bright and Beautiful]]\".{{r|memoir|p=271}} The resulting book was a huge success, spawning numerous sequels and movies and a television adaptation. \n\nWight's books are partially autobiographical, with many of the stories loosely based on real events or people. The stories are set in the fictional town of [[Darrowby]], which is a composite of Thirsk and its nearby market towns [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]], [[Leyburn]], and [[Middleham]].<ref>''James Herriot's Yorkshire'' (1979), James Herriot, St. Martin's</ref> Wight renamed Donald Sinclair and his brother [[Brian Sinclair (veterinary surgeon)|Brian]] as Siegfried and Tristan Farnon respectively, and used the name \"Helen Alderson\" for his wife Joan Danbury.  Wight's son James stated in his memoir that many of the stories which are set in the 1930s\u20131950s in the books were inspired by cases that Wight attended in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\"memoir\" /> \n\nThe books also document a transitional period in Britain's veterinary profession. Agriculture was moving from the use of draught animals (primarily horses) to the use of mechanical tractors, and medical science was on the verge of discovering antibiotics and other drugs that eliminated many of the ancient remedies still in use. These and other sociological factors (such as increased affluence) prompted a large-scale shift in veterinary practice over the course of the 20th century. At the beginning of the century, virtually all of a veterinarian's time was spent working with large animals such as horses, cattle and other livestock. By 2000, the majority of vets practised mostly on dogs, cats, and other pets belonging to a population having a larger disposable income. Wight (as Herriot) occasionally steps out of his narrative to comment on the primitive state of veterinary medicine at the time of the story he is relating.<ref name=\"thelordgodmadethemall:caesarian\">{{cite book|last1=Herriot|first1=James|title=The Lord God Made Them All|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|pages=62\u201376}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''If Only They Could Talk'', Wight wrote seven more books. In the United States, the first six books of the original series were thought too short to publish independently and were collected into omnibus volumes: the final two books were published separately. The last book of the series, ''Every Living Thing'', immediately went into the top 10 best-seller list in Britain and had an 865,000 copy first edition printing in the United States.<ref name=\"But it did happen to a vet\">Margolis, Jonathan (12 December 2002 ''Time Magazine''{{Failed verification|date=March 2012}}<!--no such issue date, no such title in the magazine's online article index--></ref> \n\n[[File:AllCreaturesGreatAndSmallSet-1-GCR 7908.JPG|thumb|Part of the [[BBC]] TV set for ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' on permanent display at the [[World of James Herriot]] museum in Thirsk, North Yorkshire]]\n\n==Film and television adaptions==\nWight's books have been adapted for film and television, including the 1975 film ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (film)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' followed by ''[[It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet]]'' in 1976, and the long-running [[BBC]] television series ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]''.

Wight married Joan Catherine Anderson Danbury on 5 November 1941 at [[St Mary's Church, Thirsk]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Herriot|first1=James|title=All Things Bright and Beautiful|date=1973|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York}}</ref> They had two children: James Alexander (born 13 February 1943), who also became a veterinarian and was a partner in the practice, and Rosemary (born 1947), who became a doctor. \n\n[[File:Herriot sign 9667.jpg|thumb|upright|Wight's original practice at 23 Kirkgate, Thirsk]]\n\n[[File:James-Herriot-Surgery-Exterior-GCR 7884.JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Herriot's former surgery|Wight's former surgery at 23 Kirkgate, [[Thirsk]]]]\n\nWight enlisted in the RAF in November 1942. He did well in his training, and was one of the first men in his regiment to fly solo. After undergoing surgery on an [[anal fistula]] in July 1943, he was deemed unfit to fly combat aircraft and was discharged as a [[leading aircraftman]]. He joined his wife at her parents' house, where she had lived since he left Thirsk. They lived there until the summer of 1945, when they moved back to 23 Kirkgate after Sinclair and his wife moved to another location. In May 1949, Wight obtained a full partnership with Sinclair.{{r|memoir|p=162}} In 1953, the family moved to a house on Topcliffe Road, Thirsk, opposite the secondary school.

At that time, books written by veterinary surgeons were considered advertisements of their services, so Wight took \"James Herriot\" as his pen name after seeing Scottish goalkeeper [[Jim Herriot]] play for [[Birmingham City F.C.]] in a televised game against [[Manchester United F.C.]]. ''If Only They Could Talk'' was published in the United Kingdom in 1970 by [[Michael Joseph Ltd]], but sales were slow until [[Thomas McCormack (writer)|Thomas McCormack]] of [[St. Martin's Press]] in New York City received a copy and arranged to have the first two books published as a single volume in the United States. Wight named the volume ''All Creatures Great and Small'' from the second line of the hymn \"[[All Things Bright and Beautiful]]\".{{r|memoir|p=271}} The resulting book was a huge success, spawning numerous sequels and movies and a television adaptation. \n\nWight's books are partially autobiographical, with many of the stories loosely based on real events or people. The stories are set in the fictional town of [[Darrowby]], which is a composite of Thirsk and its nearby market towns [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]], [[Leyburn]], and [[Middleham]].<ref>''James Herriot's Yorkshire'' (1979), James Herriot, St. Martin's</ref> Wight renamed Donald Sinclair and his brother [[Brian Sinclair (veterinary surgeon)|Brian]] as Siegfried and Tristan Farnon respectively, and used the name \"Helen Alderson\" for his wife Joan Danbury.  Wight's son James stated in his memoir that many of the stories which are set in the 1930s\u20131950s in the books were inspired by cases that Wight attended in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\"memoir\" /> \n\nThe books also document a transitional period in Britain's veterinary profession. Agriculture was moving from the use of draught animals (primarily horses) to the use of mechanical tractors, and medical science was on the verge of discovering antibiotics and other drugs that eliminated many of the ancient remedies still in use. These and other sociological factors (such as increased affluence) prompted a large-scale shift in veterinary practice over the course of the 20th century. At the beginning of the century, virtually all of a veterinarian's time was spent working with large animals such as horses, cattle and other livestock. By 2000, the majority of vets practised mostly on dogs, cats, and other pets belonging to a population having a larger disposable income. Wight (as Herriot) occasionally steps out of his narrative to comment on the primitive state of veterinary medicine at the time of the story he is relating.<ref name=\"thelordgodmadethemall:caesarian\">{{cite book|last1=Herriot|first1=James|title=The Lord God Made Them All|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|pages=62\u201376}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''If Only They Could Talk'', Wight wrote seven more books. In the United States, the first six books of the original series were thought too short to publish independently and were collected into omnibus volumes: the final two books were published separately. The last book of the series, ''Every Living Thing'', immediately went into the top 10 best-seller list in Britain and had an 865,000 copy first edition printing in the United States.<ref name=\"But it did happen to a vet\">Margolis, Jonathan (12 December 2002 ''Time Magazine''{{Failed verification|date=March 2012}}<!--no such issue date, no such title in the magazine's online article index--></ref> \n\n[[File:AllCreaturesGreatAndSmallSet-1-GCR 7908.JPG|thumb|Part of the [[BBC]] TV set for ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' on permanent display at the [[World of James Herriot]] museum in Thirsk, North Yorkshire]]\n\n==Film and television adaptions==\nWight's books have been adapted for film and television, including the 1975 film ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (film)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' followed by ''[[It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet]]'' in 1976, and the long-running [[BBC]] television series ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]''.

(A Man After Midnight).ogg\n | description = \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\"\n}}\n}}\n\n\"'''Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)'''\" is a song by Swedish band [[ABBA]]. It was recorded in August 1979 in order to help promote their North American and European tour of that year, and was released on ABBA's ''[[Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits Vol. 2]]'' album as the brand new track.\n\n==Original version==\n\n===History===\n\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\" was written and composed by [[Benny Andersson]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]], with the lead vocal sung by [[Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog]]. F\u00e4ltskog, as the narrator, weaves the image of a lonely young woman who longs for a romantic relationship and views her loneliness as a forbidding darkness of night, even drawing parallels to how the happy endings of movie stars are so different from her own existence.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} The melody line of the song was played on an [[ARP Odyssey]] synthesizer.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= John |last= Twells |title= The 14 most important synths in electronic music history \u2013 and the musicians who use them |magazine= [[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]] |date= 15 September 2016 |accessdate= 2 June 2019 |url= https://www.factmag.com/2016/09/15/14-most-important-synths/}}</ref>\n\nThe song was recorded at Polar Music Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, in August 1979, and was ready for release in October of that year, in conjunction with the group's tour of North America and Europe.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nOriginally, ABBA had recorded another song, \"Rubber Ball Man\", which was planned as a single. It featured the typical \"ABBA-arrangement\" with both F\u00e4ltskog and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] on lead vocals and the use of classical strings. This song was also performed by the group during rehearsals for its 1979 tour as \"Under My Sun\". However, the group felt that \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!\", with its disco sound, would be a better choice, and thus, \"Rubber Ball Man\" remained nothing more than a demo.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Single version===\n{{unreferenced section|date = June 2019}}\nThe single version of this song, which was released in its full length of 4:48 everywhere else in the world, was released in the United States and Canada in an edited format, being just 3:36 in length. This was done by removing the first half of the opening instrumental, the first four of the eight bars of the instrumental bridge between the second and final chorus, and fading the song out early. It is believed{{by whom|date=June 2019}} the edit was done by [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], ABBA's North American record label and not Polar, hence the reason why it was available only in the US and Canada. This single version has never appeared on any commercial CD issued by Polar/Universal to date and along with the US promo edit of \"[[Chiquitita]]\", it marked the only time Atlantic ever commercially released an edited version of an ABBA single while they had the North American rights to release ABBA recordings.\n\nThe single was never released by Polar Music in the group's native Sweden, instead being featured on the ''[[Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits Vol. 2]]'' album, which did get a Swedish release. While Polar released the single in neighbouring Norway, Denmark, and Finland, copies of these versions were not made available in the Swedish record stores, who thus arranged to import copies of the United Kingdom version on Epic Records. Sales of these imports were sufficient for the single to reach no. 16 on the sales chart in Sweden.\n\n===Spanish version===\n\"'''\u00a1Dame! \u00a1Dame! \u00a1Dame!'''\" is the Spanish-language version of the song. The song was released as a single to promote ''[[Gracias Por La M\u00fasica (album)|Gracias Por La M\u00fasica]]'' in Latin America and other Spanish-speaking countries.\n\n===Reception===\n\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\" was another highly successful song for ABBA. It hit no. 1 in Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, and Switzerland, while reaching the Top 3 in Austria, Germany, The United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Norway. It also proved to be ABBA's most successful song in Japan, hitting no. 17.\n\n===Charts and certifications===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Weekly charts====\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1979\u20131980)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite web|title= Forum \u2013 ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts \u2013 CHART POSITIONS PRE 1989 |publisher= Australian-charts.com.

It was recorded in August 1979 in order to help promote their North American and European tour of that year, and was released on ABBA's ''[[Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits Vol. 2]]'' album as the brand new track.\n\n==Original version==\n\n===History===\n\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\" was written and composed by [[Benny Andersson]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]], with the lead vocal sung by [[Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog]]. F\u00e4ltskog, as the narrator, weaves the image of a lonely young woman who longs for a romantic relationship and views her loneliness as a forbidding darkness of night, even drawing parallels to how the happy endings of movie stars are so different from her own existence.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} The melody line of the song was played on an [[ARP Odyssey]] synthesizer.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= John |last= Twells |title= The 14 most important synths in electronic music history \u2013 and the musicians who use them |magazine= [[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]] |date= 15 September 2016 |accessdate= 2 June 2019 |url= https://www.factmag.com/2016/09/15/14-most-important-synths/}}</ref>\n\nThe song was recorded at Polar Music Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, in August 1979, and was ready for release in October of that year, in conjunction with the group's tour of North America and Europe.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nOriginally, ABBA had recorded another song, \"Rubber Ball Man\", which was planned as a single. It featured the typical \"ABBA-arrangement\" with both F\u00e4ltskog and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] on lead vocals and the use of classical strings. This song was also performed by the group during rehearsals for its 1979 tour as \"Under My Sun\". However, the group felt that \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!\", with its disco sound, would be a better choice, and thus, \"Rubber Ball Man\" remained nothing more than a demo.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Single version===\n{{unreferenced section|date = June 2019}}\nThe single version of this song, which was released in its full length of 4:48 everywhere else in the world, was released in the United States and Canada in an edited format, being just 3:36 in length. This was done by removing the first half of the opening instrumental, the first four of the eight bars of the instrumental bridge between the second and final chorus, and fading the song out early. It is believed{{by whom|date=June 2019}} the edit was done by [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], ABBA's North American record label and not Polar, hence the reason why it was available only in the US and Canada. This single version has never appeared on any commercial CD issued by Polar/Universal to date and along with the US promo edit of \"[[Chiquitita]]\", it marked the only time Atlantic ever commercially released an edited version of an ABBA single while they had the North American rights to release ABBA recordings.\n\nThe single was never released by Polar Music in the group's native Sweden, instead being featured on the ''[[Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits Vol. 2]]'' album, which did get a Swedish release. While Polar released the single in neighbouring Norway, Denmark, and Finland, copies of these versions were not made available in the Swedish record stores, who thus arranged to import copies of the United Kingdom version on Epic Records. Sales of these imports were sufficient for the single to reach no. 16 on the sales chart in Sweden.\n\n===Spanish version===\n\"'''\u00a1Dame! \u00a1Dame! \u00a1Dame!'''\" is the Spanish-language version of the song. The song was released as a single to promote ''[[Gracias Por La M\u00fasica (album)|Gracias Por La M\u00fasica]]'' in Latin America and other Spanish-speaking countries.\n\n===Reception===\n\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\" was another highly successful song for ABBA. It hit no. 1 in Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, and Switzerland, while reaching the Top 3 in Austria, Germany, The United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Norway. It also proved to be ABBA's most successful song in Japan, hitting no. 17.\n\n===Charts and certifications===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Weekly charts====\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1979\u20131980)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite web|title= Forum \u2013 ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts \u2013 CHART POSITIONS PRE 1989 |publisher= Australian-charts.com.

The song peaked at no. 51 in Switzerland, no. 27 in the Netherlands, no. 20 in Mexico, and no. 22 in Argentina and Chile.\n\n\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\" was recorded in Spanish for the Latin American promotion that started in early 2000.\n\n===Music video===\nThe music video was directed by Sebastian Reed, and it was filmed in Sweden.\n\nThe video starts with the boys entering a [[warehouse]], where they find a crystal ball. Inside, there is an \"alternate world\" where they perform the song. Part of the video also features the band at a [[bowling|bowling alley]] where they play a few games against each other.\n\nThe video had high rotation on several music channels, but it was not as successful as the first singles.\n\nThe version of the song used on the video is the Radio Version, which is shorter and includes different beats and sounds to the album version.\n\n===Releases===\n'''European 2-track CD single'''\n#\"Gimme!

East of 101\u00b0W dome complexes, lava flows, and large calderas that produced significant quantities of ignimbrites (>50&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>) of [[Dacite|dacitic]] to [[Rhyolite|rhyolitic]] composition can be found dating between 7.5 and 6 Ma. There is an absence of silicic volcanism between these regions during the whole Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt history. Since the late Miocene, silicic volcanism migrated trenchward over 200&nbsp;km in the eastern sector (east of 101\u00b0W) and 100&nbsp;km in the western sector (West of 103\u00b0W).<ref name=\"FOEMM\"/><ref name=\"F\"/><ref name=\"FPF\"/><ref name=\"AGL\"/>\n* 4) Since the late Pliocene, the style and composition of volcanism in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt became more diverse. In several areas, volumetrically dominant calc-alkaline rocks are associated with modest volumes of intraplate-like lavas or other potassium rich rocks, accompanied by Quaternary rhyolitic [[peralkaline rock]]s. This modern arc consists of a frontal belt dominated by [[Flux melting|flux]] and slab melting and a rear belt characterized by the [[Igneous differentiation|differentiated]] rocks stated previously.<ref name=\"FOEMM\"/><ref name=\"FMM\"/> Absent since ~9 Ma, [[stratovolcano]]es began to be created in the last 1 Ma ~100&nbsp;km behind the volcanic front in the Western Sector, oriented West - Northwest and East - Southeast. In the eastern sector, all stratovolcanoes are found within the volcanic front. One exception to the location of these stratovolcanoes is the [[Volc\u00e1n de Colima|Colima volcanic complex]], which is positioned south of the southern tip of the Cocos and Rivera slab tear and is the largest volcanic edifice in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.<ref name=\"FOEMM\"/> In addition to stratovolcanoes, monogenetic volcanic fields are also characteristic for this episode, the most prominent being the [[Michoac\u00e1n\u2013Guanajuato volcanic field]].\n\n===Cause of flat slab subduction===\n[[Flat slab subduction]] can commonly be explained by [[oceanic plateau]] subduction and a fast overriding plate. Central Mexico's flat subduction is not evident. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic belt's flat slab is confined between ~101\u00b0W and 96\u00b0W; this region may be explained by thicker [[continental crust]]. Existence of thick strong crust combined with decreasing fluid input contributed to narrowing the asthenospheric wedge, increasing viscosity and suction forces, which led to flat subduction\u2014preventing the [[oceanic plate]] from entering the mantle.<ref name=\"FOEMM\"/><ref name=\"Bunch\">{{cite journal|last1=P\u00e9rez-Campos|first1=Xyoli|last2=Kim|first2=YoungHee|last3=Huske|first3=Allen|last4=Davis|first4=Paul|last5=Clayton|first5=Robert|last6=Iglesias|first6=Arturo|last7=Pacheco|first7=Javier|last8=Singh|first8=Shri|last9=Manea|first9=Vlad|last10=Gurnis|first10=Michael|title=Horizontal subduction and truncation of the Cocos Plate beneath central Mexico|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=35|issue=18|pages=L18303|doi=10.1029/2008GL035127|bibcode=2008GeoRL..3518303P|year=2008|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/12265/1/PERgrl08.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Region===\nFrom the west, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt runs from  [[Colima]] and [[Jalisco]] east through northern [[Michoac\u00e1n]], southern [[Guanajuato]], southern [[Quer\u00e9taro]], [[Mexico (state)|M\u00e9xico State]], southern [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]], the [[Mexico City|Distrito Federal]], northern [[Morelos]], [[Puebla]], and [[Tlaxcala]], to central [[Veracruz]].\n\nThe [[Mexican Plateau]] lies to the north, bounded by the  [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] to the west and [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] to the east.

The ''Engleriana'' subgenus is found only in East Asia, distinctive for their low branches, often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark. The better known ''Fagus'' subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark. The European beech (''Fagus sylvatica'') is the most commonly cultivated.\n\nBeeches are [[monoecious]], bearing both male and female [[flower]]s on the same plant. The small flowers are unisexual, the female flowers borne in pairs, the male flowers wind-pollinating [[catkin]]s. They are produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear. The fruit of the beech tree, known as beechnuts or mast, is found in small burrs that drop from the tree in autumn. They are  small, roughly triangular and edible, with a bitter, astringent, or in some cases, mild and nut-like taste. They have a high enough fat content that they can be pressed for edible oil.\n\nThe European species ''Fagus sylvatica'' yields a utility timber that is tough but dimensionally unstable. It is widely used for furniture framing and carcase construction, flooring and engineering purposes, in plywood and in household items like plates, but rarely as a decorative wood. The timber can be used to build chalets, houses, and log cabins.\n\nBeech wood also makes excellent [[firewood]], easily split and burning for many hours with bright but calm flames. Slats of washed beech wood are spread around the bottom of fermentation tanks for [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] [[beer]]. Beech logs are burned to dry the [[malt]] used in some German [[smoked beer]]s, giving the beers their typical flavor. Beech is also used to smoke [[Westphalian ham]], various sausages, and some cheeses.\n\n<br />\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe name of the tree (Latin ''fagus'', whence the species name; cognate with English \"beech\") is of Indo-European origin, and played an important role in early debates on the geographical origins of the [[Indo-European people]]. [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c6\u03b7\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 is from the same root, but the word was transferred to the [[oak]] tree (e.g. Iliad 16.767) as a result of the absence of beech trees in [[Greece]].<ref>Robert Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Leiden and Boston 2010, pp. 1565\u20136</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nRecent classification systems of the genus recognize 10 to 13 species in two distinct subgenera, ''Engleriana'' and ''Fagus''.<ref>Denk, Thomas with Guido Grimm and Vera Hemleben. 2005.

Ph.D. Dissertation, City University of New York.</ref> The ''Engleriana'' subgenus is found only in East Asia, and is notably distinct from the ''Fagus'' subgenus in that these beeches are low-branching trees, often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark. Further differentiating characteristics include the whitish bloom on the underside of the leaves, the visible tertiary leaf veins, and a long, smooth cupule-peduncle. ''[[Fagus japonica]]'', ''[[Fagus engleriana]]'', and the species ''F. okamotoi'', proposed by the botanist Chung-Fu Shen in 1992, comprise this subgenus.<ref name=\"Shen, Chung-Fu 1992\" /> The better known ''Fagus'' subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark. \n\nThis group includes ''[[Fagus sylvatica]]'', ''[[Fagus grandifolia]]'', ''[[Fagus crenata]]'', ''[[Fagus lucida]]'', ''[[Fagus longipetiolata]]'', and ''[[Fagus hayatae]]''.<ref name=\"Shen, Chung-Fu 1992\" /> The classification of the European beech, ''Fagus sylvatica'' is complex, with a variety of different names proposed for different species and subspecies within this region (for example ''[[Fagus taurica]]'', ''[[Fagus orientalis]]'', and ''Fagus moesica''<ref>Gomory, D. with L. Paule, R. Brus, P. Zhelev, Z. Tomovic, and J. Gracan. 1999. Genetic differentiation and phylogeny of beech on the Balkan peninsula. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 12: 746-752.</ref>). Research suggests that beeches in Eurasia differentiated fairly late in evolutionary history, during the Miocene. The populations in this area represent a range of often overlapping morphotypes, though genetic analysis does not clearly support separate species.<ref>Denk, Thomas with Guido Grimm, K. Stogerer, M. Langer, Vera Hemleben 2002. The evolutionary history of ''Fagus'' in western Eurasia: Evidence from genes, morphology and the fossil record.

The leaves of beech trees are entire or sparsely toothed, from {{convert|5|\u2013|15|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4|\u2013|10|cm|abbr=on}} broad. Beeches are [[monoecious]], bearing both male and female [[flower]]s on the same plant. The small flowers are unisexual, the female flowers borne in pairs, the male flowers wind-pollinating [[catkin]]s. They are produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear. \n\nThe bark is smooth and light grey. The [[fruit]] is a small, sharply three-angled [[nut (fruit)|nut]] {{convert|10|\u2013|15|mm|abbr=on}} long, borne singly or in pairs in soft-spined husks {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2.5|cm|abbr=on}} long, known as cupules. The husk can have a variety of spine- to scale-like appendages, the character of which is, in addition to leaf shape, one of the primary ways beeches are differentiated.<ref name=\"Shen, Chung-Fu 1992\" /> The nuts are edible, though bitter (though not nearly as bitter as [[acorn]]s) with a high [[tannin]] content, and are called beechnuts or beechmast.\n\n== Habitat ==\nBeech grows on a wide range of soil types, acidic or basic, provided they are not waterlogged. The tree canopy casts dense shade, and carpets the ground thickly with leaf litter.\n\nIn [[North America]], they often form [[Beech-maple forest|beech-maple]] [[climax community|climax]] forests by partnering with the [[sugar maple]].\n\nThe [[beech blight aphid]] (''Grylloprociphilus imbricator'') is a common pest of American beech trees. Beeches are also used as [[list of Lepidoptera that feed on beeches|food plants]] by some species of [[Lepidoptera]].\n\nBeech bark is extremely thin and scars easily. Since the beech tree has such delicate bark, carvings, such as lovers' initials and other forms of graffiti, remain because the tree is unable to heal itself.<ref>Lawrence, Gale. A Field Guide to the Familiar: Learning to Observe the Natural World. Hanover: University Press of New England, 1984. 75-76.

[[Oxford University Press]]</ref> The tallest and longest hedge in the world (according to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'') is the [[Meikleour Beech Hedges|Meikleour Beech Hedge]] in [[Meikleour]], [[Perth and Kinross]], [[Scotland]].\n\n=== Continental Europe ===\n[[File:Grib skov.jpg|thumb|left|European beech (''Fagus sylvatica'')]]\n[[File:Beechnuts during autumn.jpg|thumb|Beechnuts in [[autumn]]]]\n[[File:Olympus8.jpg|right|thumb|Beech forest on [[Mount Olympus]] in Greece]]\n\nThe common European beech (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]'') grows naturally in [[Denmark]] and southern [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] up to about the 57\u201359\u00b0N. The most northern known naturally growing (not planted) beech trees are found in a small grove north of [[Bergen]] on the west coast of Norway with the [[North Sea]] nearby. Near the city of [[Larvik]] is the largest naturally occurring [[B\u00f8keskogen|beech]] forest in Norway. Planted beeches are grown much farther north along the Norwegian coast.\n\nSome research suggests that early agriculture patterns supported the spread of beech in continental Europe. Research has linked the establishment of beech stands in Scandinavia and Germany with cultivation and fire disturbance, i.e. early agricultural practices. Other areas which have a long history of cultivation, Bulgaria for example, do not exhibit this pattern, so  how much human activity has influenced the spread of beech trees is as yet unclear.<ref>Bradshaw, R.H.W. with N. Kito and T. Giesecke. 2010. Factors influencing the Holocene history of Fagus. Forest Ecology and Management 259:2204-2212.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Atget - Beech Tree - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''Beech Tree'' photographed by [[Eug\u00e8ne Atget]], ''circa'' 1910\u20131915]]\nAs a naturally growing forest tree, it marks the important border between the European deciduous forest zone and the northern pine forest zone. This border is important for wildlife and fauna, and is a sharp line along the Swedish western coast, which gets broader toward the south. In Denmark and Scania, at the southernmost peak of the Scandinavian peninsula, south-west of the natural [[spruce]] boundary, it is the most common forest tree. In Norway, the beech migration was very recent, and the species has not reached its distribution potential. Thus, the occurrence of oak in Norway is used as an indicator of the border between the temperate deciduous forest and the boreal spruce \u2013 pine forest.\n\n''Fagus sylvatica'' is one of the most common hardwood trees in north central Europe, in France alone comprising about 15% of all nonconifers.\n\nThe primeval beech forests of the Carpathians are also an example of a singular, complete, and comprehensive forest dominated by a single tree species - the beech tree. Forest dynamics here were allowed to proceed without interruption or interference since the last ice age. Nowadays, they are amongst the last pure beech forests in Europe to document the undisturbed postglacial repopulation of the species, which also includes the unbroken existence of typical animals and plants.\n\n=== North America ===\n[[File:Beech with Branches.jpg|thumb|upright|North American beech (''[[Fagus grandifolia]]''), seen in [[autumn]]]]\n\nThe American beech (''[[Fagus grandifolia]]'') occurs across much of the eastern United States and southeastern [[Canada]], with a disjunct population in [[Mexico]]. It is the only ''Fagus'' species in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Prior to the [[Pleistocene]] Ice Age, it is believed to have spanned the entire width of the continent from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Pacific]], but now is confined to east of the Great Plains. ''F. grandifolia'' tolerates hotter climates than European species, but is not planted much as an ornamental due to slower growth and less resistance to urban pollution. It most commonly occurs as an overstory component in the northern part of its range with sugar maple, transitioning to other forest types further south such as beech-magnolia. American beech is rarely encountered in developed areas unless as a remnant of a forest that was cut down for land development.\n\n=== Asia ===\n[[File:Fagus engleriana - Morris Arboretum - DSC00475.JPG|thumb|left|Chinese beech (''[[Fagus engleriana]]'')]]\n\nEast Asia is home to five species of ''Fagus'', only one of which (''F. crenata'') is occasionally planted in Western countries. Smaller than ''F. sylvatica'' and ''F. grandifolia'', Japanese beech is one of the most common hardwoods in its native range.\n\n== Uses ==\nBeech wood is an excellent [[firewood]], easily split and burning for many hours with bright but calm flames.

The ''Engleriana'' subgenus is found only in East Asia, distinctive for their low branches, often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark. The better known ''Fagus'' subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark. The European beech (''Fagus sylvatica'') is the most commonly cultivated.\n\nBeeches are [[monoecious]], bearing both male and female [[flower]]s on the same plant. The small flowers are unisexual, the female flowers borne in pairs, the male flowers wind-pollinating [[catkin]]s. They are produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear. The fruit of the beech tree, known as beechnuts or mast, is found in small burrs that drop from the tree in autumn.

Slats of washed beech wood are spread around the bottom of fermentation tanks for [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] [[beer]]. Beech logs are burned to dry the [[malt]] used in some German [[smoked beer]]s, giving the beers their typical flavor. Beech is also used to smoke [[Westphalian ham]], various sausages, and some cheeses.\n\n<br />\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe name of the tree (Latin ''fagus'', whence the species name; cognate with English \"beech\") is of Indo-European origin, and played an important role in early debates on the geographical origins of the [[Indo-European people]]. [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c6\u03b7\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 is from the same root, but the word was transferred to the [[oak]] tree (e.g. Iliad 16.767) as a result of the absence of beech trees in [[Greece]].<ref>Robert Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Leiden and Boston 2010, pp. 1565\u20136</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nRecent classification systems of the genus recognize 10 to 13 species in two distinct subgenera, ''Engleriana'' and ''Fagus''.<ref>Denk, Thomas with Guido Grimm and Vera Hemleben. 2005.

Further differentiating characteristics include the whitish bloom on the underside of the leaves, the visible tertiary leaf veins, and a long, smooth cupule-peduncle. ''[[Fagus japonica]]'', ''[[Fagus engleriana]]'', and the species ''F. okamotoi'', proposed by the botanist Chung-Fu Shen in 1992, comprise this subgenus.<ref name=\"Shen, Chung-Fu 1992\" /> The better known ''Fagus'' subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark. \n\nThis group includes ''[[Fagus sylvatica]]'', ''[[Fagus grandifolia]]'', ''[[Fagus crenata]]'', ''[[Fagus lucida]]'', ''[[Fagus longipetiolata]]'', and ''[[Fagus hayatae]]''.<ref name=\"Shen, Chung-Fu 1992\" /> The classification of the European beech, ''Fagus sylvatica'' is complex, with a variety of different names proposed for different species and subspecies within this region (for example ''[[Fagus taurica]]'', ''[[Fagus orientalis]]'', and ''Fagus moesica''<ref>Gomory, D. with L.

The leaves of beech trees are entire or sparsely toothed, from {{convert|5|\u2013|15|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4|\u2013|10|cm|abbr=on}} broad. Beeches are [[monoecious]], bearing both male and female [[flower]]s on the same plant. The small flowers are unisexual, the female flowers borne in pairs, the male flowers wind-pollinating [[catkin]]s. They are produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear. \n\nThe bark is smooth and light grey. The [[fruit]] is a small, sharply three-angled [[nut (fruit)|nut]] {{convert|10|\u2013|15|mm|abbr=on}} long, borne singly or in pairs in soft-spined husks {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2.5|cm|abbr=on}} long, known as cupules. The husk can have a variety of spine- to scale-like appendages, the character of which is, in addition to leaf shape, one of the primary ways beeches are differentiated.<ref name=\"Shen, Chung-Fu 1992\" /> The nuts are edible, though bitter (though not nearly as bitter as [[acorn]]s) with a high [[tannin]] content, and are called beechnuts or beechmast.\n\n== Habitat ==\nBeech grows on a wide range of soil types, acidic or basic, provided they are not waterlogged. The tree canopy casts dense shade, and carpets the ground thickly with leaf litter.\n\nIn [[North America]], they often form [[Beech-maple forest|beech-maple]] [[climax community|climax]] forests by partnering with the [[sugar maple]].\n\nThe [[beech blight aphid]] (''Grylloprociphilus imbricator'') is a common pest of American beech trees. Beeches are also used as [[list of Lepidoptera that feed on beeches|food plants]] by some species of [[Lepidoptera]].\n\nBeech bark is extremely thin and scars easily. Since the beech tree has such delicate bark, carvings, such as lovers' initials and other forms of graffiti, remain because the tree is unable to heal itself.<ref>Lawrence, Gale.

Planted beeches are grown much farther north along the Norwegian coast.\n\nSome research suggests that early agriculture patterns supported the spread of beech in continental Europe. Research has linked the establishment of beech stands in Scandinavia and Germany with cultivation and fire disturbance, i.e. early agricultural practices. Other areas which have a long history of cultivation, Bulgaria for example, do not exhibit this pattern, so  how much human activity has influenced the spread of beech trees is as yet unclear.<ref>Bradshaw, R.H.W. with N.

Forest Ecology and Management 259:2204-2212.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Atget - Beech Tree - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''Beech Tree'' photographed by [[Eug\u00e8ne Atget]], ''circa'' 1910\u20131915]]\nAs a naturally growing forest tree, it marks the important border between the European deciduous forest zone and the northern pine forest zone. This border is important for wildlife and fauna, and is a sharp line along the Swedish western coast, which gets broader toward the south. In Denmark and Scania, at the southernmost peak of the Scandinavian peninsula, south-west of the natural [[spruce]] boundary, it is the most common forest tree. In Norway, the beech migration was very recent, and the species has not reached its distribution potential. Thus, the occurrence of oak in Norway is used as an indicator of the border between the temperate deciduous forest and the boreal spruce \u2013 pine forest.\n\n''Fagus sylvatica'' is one of the most common hardwood trees in north central Europe, in France alone comprising about 15% of all nonconifers.\n\nThe primeval beech forests of the Carpathians are also an example of a singular, complete, and comprehensive forest dominated by a single tree species - the beech tree. Forest dynamics here were allowed to proceed without interruption or interference since the last ice age. Nowadays, they are amongst the last pure beech forests in Europe to document the undisturbed postglacial repopulation of the species, which also includes the unbroken existence of typical animals and plants.\n\n=== North America ===\n[[File:Beech with Branches.jpg|thumb|upright|North American beech (''[[Fagus grandifolia]]''), seen in [[autumn]]]]\n\nThe American beech (''[[Fagus grandifolia]]'') occurs across much of the eastern United States and southeastern [[Canada]], with a disjunct population in [[Mexico]]. It is the only ''Fagus'' species in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Prior to the [[Pleistocene]] Ice Age, it is believed to have spanned the entire width of the continent from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Pacific]], but now is confined to east of the Great Plains. ''F. grandifolia'' tolerates hotter climates than European species, but is not planted much as an ornamental due to slower growth and less resistance to urban pollution. It most commonly occurs as an overstory component in the northern part of its range with sugar maple, transitioning to other forest types further south such as beech-magnolia. American beech is rarely encountered in developed areas unless as a remnant of a forest that was cut down for land development.\n\n=== Asia ===\n[[File:Fagus engleriana - Morris Arboretum - DSC00475.JPG|thumb|left|Chinese beech (''[[Fagus engleriana]]'')]]\n\nEast Asia is home to five species of ''Fagus'', only one of which (''F. crenata'') is occasionally planted in Western countries. Smaller than ''F. sylvatica'' and ''F. grandifolia'', Japanese beech is one of the most common hardwoods in its native range.\n\n== Uses ==\nBeech wood is an excellent [[firewood]], easily split and burning for many hours with bright but calm flames. Slats of beech wood are washed in caustic soda to leach out any flavor or aroma characteristics and are spread around the bottom of fermentation tanks for [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] [[beer]]. This provides a complex surface on which the yeast can settle, so that it does not pile up, preventing yeast [[autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] which would contribute off-flavors to the beer.  Beech logs are burned to dry the [[malt]] used in some German [[smoked beer]]s, giving the beers their typical flavor.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} Beech is also used to smoke [[Westphalian ham]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.germanfoods.org/consumer/facts/guidetoham.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-17 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123232931/http://www.germanfoods.org/consumer/facts/guidetoham.cfm |archivedate=2012-11-23 |df= }}</ref> various sausages,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cookthink.com/reference/823/What_is_andouille |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512015109/http://www.cookthink.com/reference/823/What_is_andouille |archive-date=2012-05-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and some cheeses.\n\nSome [[drum]]s are made from beech, which has a tone between those of [[maple]] and [[birch]], the two most popular drum woods.\n\nThe textile [[Modal (textile)|modal]] is a kind of [[rayon]] often made wholly from reconstituted [[cellulose]] of pulped beech wood.<ref>holistic-interior-designs.com, ''[http://www.holistic-interior-designs.com/modal-fabric.html Modal Fabric]'', retrieved 9 October 2011</ref><ref>uniformreuse.co.uk, ''[http://www.uniformreuse.co.uk/fabric_modal.html?KeepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=460&width=800 Modal data sheet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024015844/http://www.uniformreuse.co.uk/fabric_modal.html?KeepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=460&width=800 |date=2011-10-24 }}'', retrieved 9 October 2011</ref><ref>fabricstockexchange.com, ''[http://www.fabricstockexchange.com/blog/resources/fiber-dictionary/ Modal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925102655/http://fabricstockexchange.com/blog/resources/fiber-dictionary/ |date=2011-09-25 }}'' (dictionary entry), retrieved 9 October 2011</ref>\n\nThe European species ''Fagus sylvatica'' yields a utility timber that is tough but dimensionally unstable. It weighs about 720&nbsp;kg per cubic metre and is widely used for furniture framing and carcase construction, flooring and engineering purposes, in plywood and in household items like plates, but rarely as a decorative wood. The timber can be used to build chalets, houses, and log cabins.\n\nBeech wood is used for the stocks of military rifles when traditionally preferred woods such as [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] are scarce or unavailable or as a lower-cost alternative.<ref name=Walter>Walter J.

They are  small, roughly triangular and edible, with a bitter, astringent, or in some cases, mild and nut-like taste. They have a high enough fat content that they can be pressed for edible oil. Fresh from the tree, beech leaves in spring are a fine salad vegetable, as sweet as a mild [[cabbage]], though much softer in texture.<ref>Food for free (2004)</ref> The young leaves can be steeped in gin for several weeks, the liquor strained off and sweetened to give a light green/yellow liqueur called [[beech leaf noyau]]. As Pliny the Elder noted it in Natural History, it was beechnut that saved the people of Chios from starvation when the town was besieged. The Roman natural philosopher wrote: \"(...) there are considerable modifications in the flavour of their fruit. That of the beech is the sweetest of all; so much so, that, according to Cornelius Alexander, the people of the city of Chios, when besieged, supported themselves wholly on mast\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://interestingearth.com/how_did_beech_mast_save_the_people_of_chios.html|title=How did beech mast save the people of Chios? - Interesting Earth|website=interestingearth.com|access-date=2019-10-07}}</ref>\n\nIn antiquity, the barks of beech tree were used by [[Indo-European people]] for writing-related purposes, especially in religious context.<ref>{{cite book|author= Saskia Pronk-Tiethoff |title= The Germanic loanwords in Proto-Slavic |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0iWLAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA81 |date= 25 October 2013 |publisher= Rodopi |isbn= 978-94-012-0984-7 |pages= 81}}</ref> Beech wood tablets were a common writing material in Germanic societies before the development of [[paper]].

Many varieties are in cultivation, notably the weeping beech ''F. sylvatica'' 'Pendula', several varieties of copper or purple beech, the fern-leaved beech ''F. sylvatica'' 'Asplenifolia', and the tricolour beech ''F. sylvatica'' 'roseomarginata'. The strikingly columnar Dawyck beech (''F. sylvatica'' 'Dawyck') occurs in green, gold, and purple forms, named after [[Dawyck Botanic Garden]] in the Scottish Borders, one of the four garden sites of the [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]]. Europe is also home to the lesser-known Oriental beech (''F. orientalis'') and Crimean beech (''F. taurica'').\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe]]\n* [[English Lowlands beech forests]]\n* [[Sylvatic]]a ecology cycle 'Sylvatic' means 'occurring in or affecting woodland'\n* [[The Weeping Beech]]\n*[[Beech leaf disease]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Fagus|beeches}}\n{{Wikispecies|Fagus|''Fagus''}}\n{{Wiktionary|beech}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/|title=WCSP |work= World Checklist of Selected Plant Families \u2013 Fagus}}\n* {{cite web|last=Eichhorn|first=Markus|title=The Beech Tree|url=http://www.test-tube.org.uk/trees/video_beech.htm|work=Test Tube|publisher=[[Brady Haran]] for the [[University of Nottingham]]|date=October 2010}}\n* [https://www.eatweeds.co.uk/beech-fagus-sylvatica Traditional and Modern Use of Beech]\n\n{{Nuts}}\n{{Woodworking}}\n{{Taxonbar|from1=Q25403|from2=Q14920699}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Fagus| ]]\n[[Category:Edible nuts and seeds]]\n", "name_user": "Elmo Twinge", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beech"}
