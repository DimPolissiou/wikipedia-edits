Ostrom was a professor at [[Yale University]] where he was the Curator Emeritus of [[vertebrate paleontology]] at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]], which has an impressive fossil collection originally started by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. He died from complications of [[Alzheimer's disease]] at the age of 77 in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/21/AR2005072102218.html|title=Dinosaur Expert John Ostrom Dies|last=Schudel|first=Matt|date=July 22, 2005|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref>\n\n== Key Discoveries ==\n\nIn the field of paleontology, Ostrom is responsible for the following key discoveries:\n\n=== Warm-blooded ''Deinonychus'' ===\n\nHis 1964 discovery of additional ''[[Deinonychus]]'' fossils is considered one of the most important fossil finds in history.<ref>[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/saurischia/dromaeosauridae.html Dromaeosauridae<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ''Deinonychus'' was an active predator that clearly killed its prey by leaping and slashing or stabbing with its \"terrible claw\". Evidence of a truly active lifestyle included long strings of [[muscle]] running along the tail, making it a stiff counterbalance for jumping and running. The conclusion that at least some dinosaurs had a high metabolism, and were thus in some cases [[warm-blooded]], was popularized by his student [[Robert T. Bakker]]. This helped to change the impression of dinosaurs as the sluggish, slow, [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] lizards which had prevailed since the turn of the century.\n\nThis changed how dinosaurs are depicted by both professional dinosaur illustrators, and in the public eye. The find is also credited with triggering the \"[[dinosaur renaissance]]\", a term coined in a 1975 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'' by Bakker to describe the renewed debates causing an influx of interest in paleontology, which has lasted from the 1970s to the present and has doubled recorded dinosaur diversity.\n\n=== ''Archaeopteryx'' and the origin of flight, and hadrosaur herds ===\nOstrom's interest in the dinosaur-bird connection started with his study of what is now known as the [[Haarlem]] ''Archaeopteryx''. Discovered in 1855, it was actually the first specimen recovered but, incorrectly labeled as ''[[Pterodactylus]] crassipes'', it languished in the [[Teylers Museum]] in the [[Netherlands]] until Ostrom's 1970 paper (and 1972 description) correctly identified it as one of only eight \"first birds\" (counting the solitary feather).\n\nOstrom's reading of fossilized ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' [[fossil trackway|trackway]]s also led him to the conclusion that these duckbilled dinosaurs traveled in herds.\n\n== Cultural Influence ==\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20060527061919/http://athena.english.vt.edu/~hagedorn/TechnicalWriting/Archaeoptryx.html John Ostrom's work on the functional morphology] of dinosaurs found that the claws and tendon scars in the tail would indicate a running position. And so the whole posture of bipedal dinosaurs changed to one of agile, fast-running, fearsome predators. This inspired a new generation of dinosaur movies and also museums worldwide changed their dinosaur bone displays.\n\nIn 1966 John H. Ostrom was instrumental in the establishment of [[Dinosaur State Park and Arboretum|Dinosaur State Park]] in Rocky Hill, Connecticut (\"because the governor was besieged by letters from schoolchildren swayed into dino-mania by Ostrom\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-2005-07-23-0507230017-story.html|title=BRINGING SHALE TO LIFE|last=Carlson|first=Barbara|date=July 23, 2005|website=courant.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref>).\n\n== Dinosaur Dig Sites ==\n\nJohn Ostrom set up a full-time [http://www.dinochecker.com/dinosaurs/TENONTOSAURUS dig site at the Big Horn Basin, Wyoming] in the 1960s, as well he spent a lot of time digging at Rocky Hill.\n\n== Scientific classification == \n* In 1970 John Ostrom gave ''[[Microvenator celer]]'' its formal name (meaning \"fast small hunter\"). \n* Also in 1970 he named ''[[Tenontosaurus tilletti]]'' (meaning \"tendon lizard\").\n* In 1993 [[James Kirkland (paleontologist)|James Kirkland]], Robert Gaston, and Donald Burge named a fossil ''[[Utahraptor ostrommaysorum]]'' for John Ostrom and Chris Mays. The largest discovered example of this species is 23 feet long and had an estimated live weight over 1000 pounds.\n* In 1998 [[Catherine Forster]] named a fossil ''[[Rahonavis ostromi]]'' (meaning \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060527061919/http://athena.english.vt.edu/~hagedorn/TechnicalWriting/Archaeoptryx.html Ostrom's menace from the clouds]\") in honour of John Ostrom. The fossil is that of a primitive winged creature with a two-foot wingspan, feathers and a sickle-shaped claw on its second toe designed for slashing prey, similar to ''Deinonychus'' and ''Archaeopteryx''.\n* In 2017, ''[[Ostromia]]'' (a new genus named for the Haarlem specimen, formerly of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'') was named in his honor.\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n===Sources===\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527061919/http://athena.english.vt.edu/~hagedorn/TechnicalWriting/Archaeoptryx.html |date=May 27, 2006 |title=\"''Archaeopteryx''\" }}.

London: Witherby.</ref> Ostrom showed that dinosaurs were more like big non-flying [[bird]]s than they were like [[lizard]]s (or \"saurians\").\n\nThe first of Ostrom's broad-based reviews of the [[osteology]] and [[phylogeny]] of the primitive bird ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' appeared in 1976. His reaction to the eventual discovery of [[feathered dinosaur]]s in [[China]], after years of acrimonious debate, was bittersweet.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/2001-05-05/news/0105050807_1_birds-and-dinosaurs-archaeopteryx-well-preserved-dinosaur At last, his theory flies].

He planned to be a physician like his father, but he changed his mind after reading [[George Gaylord Simpson]]'s book ''The Meaning of Evolution''. He enrolled at [[Columbia University]] and studied with [[Edwin H. Colbert]].\nThe type species [[Utahraptor ostrommaysorum]] was named in his honour.\nIn 1952 he married Nancy Grace Hartman (d. 2003) and they had two daughters: Karen and Alicia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-2005-07-19-0507180588-story.html|title=OSTROM, DR.

Ostrom was a professor at [[Yale University]] where he was the Curator Emeritus of [[vertebrate paleontology]] at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]], which has an impressive fossil collection originally started by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. He died from complications of [[Alzheimer's disease]] at the age of 77 in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/21/AR2005072102218.html|title=Dinosaur Expert John Ostrom Dies|last=Schudel|first=Matt|date=July 22, 2005|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref>\n\n== Key Discoveries ==\n\nIn the field of paleontology, Ostrom is responsible for the following key discoveries:\n\n=== Warm-blooded ''Deinonychus'' ===\n\nHis 1964 discovery of additional ''[[Deinonychus]]'' fossils is considered one of the most important fossil finds in history.<ref>[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/saurischia/dromaeosauridae.html Dromaeosauridae<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ''Deinonychus'' was an active predator that clearly killed its prey by leaping and slashing or stabbing with its \"terrible claw\". Evidence of a truly active lifestyle included long strings of [[muscle]] running along the tail, making it a stiff counterbalance for jumping and running. The conclusion that at least some dinosaurs had a high metabolism, and were thus in some cases [[warm-blooded]], was popularized by his student [[Robert T. Bakker]]. This helped to change the impression of dinosaurs as the sluggish, slow, [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] lizards which had prevailed since the turn of the century.\n\nThis changed how dinosaurs are depicted by both professional dinosaur illustrators, and in the public eye. The find is also credited with triggering the \"[[dinosaur renaissance]]\", a term coined in a 1975 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'' by Bakker to describe the renewed debates causing an influx of interest in paleontology, which has lasted from the 1970s to the present and has doubled recorded dinosaur diversity.\n\n=== ''Archaeopteryx'' and the origin of flight, and hadrosaur herds ===\nOstrom's interest in the dinosaur-bird connection started with his study of what is now known as the [[Haarlem]] ''Archaeopteryx''. Discovered in 1855, it was actually the first specimen recovered but, incorrectly labeled as ''[[Pterodactylus]] crassipes'', it languished in the [[Teylers Museum]] in the [[Netherlands]] until Ostrom's 1970 paper (and 1972 description) correctly identified it as one of only eight \"first birds\" (counting the solitary feather).\n\nOstrom's reading of fossilized ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' [[fossil trackway|trackway]]s also led him to the conclusion that these duckbilled dinosaurs traveled in herds.\n\n== Cultural Influence ==\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20060527061919/http://athena.english.vt.edu/~hagedorn/TechnicalWriting/Archaeoptryx.html John Ostrom's work on the functional morphology] of dinosaurs found that the claws and tendon scars in the tail would indicate a running position. And so the whole posture of bipedal dinosaurs changed to one of agile, fast-running, fearsome predators. This inspired a new generation of dinosaur movies and also museums worldwide changed their dinosaur bone displays.\n\nIn 1966 John H. Ostrom was instrumental in the establishment of [[Dinosaur State Park and Arboretum|Dinosaur State Park]] in Rocky Hill, Connecticut (\"because the governor was besieged by letters from schoolchildren swayed into dino-mania by Ostrom\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-2005-07-23-0507230017-story.html|title=BRINGING SHALE TO LIFE|last=Carlson|first=Barbara|date=July 23, 2005|website=courant.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref>).\n\n== Dinosaur Dig Sites ==\n\nJohn Ostrom set up a full-time [http://www.dinochecker.com/dinosaurs/TENONTOSAURUS dig site at the Big Horn Basin, Wyoming] in the 1960s, as well he spent a lot of time digging at Rocky Hill.\n\n== Scientific classification == \n* In 1970 John Ostrom gave ''[[Microvenator celer]]'' its formal name (meaning \"fast small hunter\"). \n* Also in 1970 he named ''[[Tenontosaurus tilletti]]'' (meaning \"tendon lizard\").\n* In 1993 [[James Kirkland (paleontologist)|James Kirkland]], Robert Gaston, and Donald Burge named a fossil ''[[Utahraptor ostrommaysorum]]'' for John Ostrom and Chris Mays. The largest discovered example of this species is 23 feet long and had an estimated live weight over 1000 pounds.\n* In 1998 [[Catherine Forster]] named a fossil ''[[Rahonavis ostromi]]'' (meaning \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060527061919/http://athena.english.vt.edu/~hagedorn/TechnicalWriting/Archaeoptryx.html Ostrom's menace from the clouds]\") in honour of John Ostrom. The fossil is that of a primitive winged creature with a two-foot wingspan, feathers and a sickle-shaped claw on its second toe designed for slashing prey, similar to ''Deinonychus'' and ''Archaeopteryx''.\n* In 2017, ''[[Ostromia]]'' (a new genus named for the Haarlem specimen, formerly of [[Archaeopteryx]]) was named in his honor.\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n===Sources===\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527061919/http://athena.english.vt.edu/~hagedorn/TechnicalWriting/Archaeoptryx.html |date=May 27, 2006 |title=\"''Archaeopteryx''\" }}.

This presents one downfall to the studying of plant taxa through starch grain analysis.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> Moving on, the ability for long term storage of starch grains for an energy source utilized by plants, makes starch grains a valuable source of study within an archaeological context.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> Starch is stored in the [[amyloplasts]], a specialized organelle found within plant cells, as starch grains.<ref name=Cortella>{{cite journal |last1=Cortella |first1=A.R. |last2=Pochettino |first2=M.L. |title=Starch Grain Anaalysis as a Microscopic Diagnostic Feature in the Identification  fo Plant Material |journal=JSTOR |date=January 4, 1994 |volume=Economic Botany 48(2) |issue=The New York Botanical Garden Press |pages=171-181}}</ref> The starch grain is specifically important for study due to the fact that it is commonly found in most plants, its long-lasting nature, as well as the diverse forms and structures that they can take based on which taxa they belong to.<ref name=Cortella />\n\n==Starch Grain Lab Techniques==\n====Staining Solutions====\nStaining solutions are one way to make comparative analysis of starch granules more accessible, depending on what type of stain is specifically used. For example, as stated by Kov\u00e1rn\u00edk and Benes, [[Lugol's solution]] stains the grains a dark blue color, in order to distinguish the starch grain from other common structures that can appear similar in size and shape.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> In addition to this technique, the use of CongoRed dye marks the damage, making it easier to study, compare, and to anlayze differences in the damage of particular taxa. Specifically, the intensity of the red color depends on how damaged the grain is.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> Lastly, [[Trypan blue]] is another way to stain grain damage within starch grains, only staining the damaged grains, not the undamaged.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> Specifically, it can be important to incorporate the staining process into an analysis due to the fact that there are several other structures found naturally that have similar characteristics to starch when compared under a microscope.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes />  \n\n====Starch Extraction in the Context of Archaeological Tools====\nThere are several ways to go about extracting the starch granules from stone tools. One technique as explained by Kov\u00e1rnik and Benes described as the most common, is through pipetting the surface of the objects on the most common areas in which starch grains are found, for example fissures, or others divetts on the artifact.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> The water droplets from the pipetting technique are then collected onto slides to be utilized in comparative analysis. This is a common technique for the use of understanding specifically how stone tools were used, and what types of plants were being exploited during the time being studied.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> \n\nAnother common approach is to dislodge the starch grains through [[sonication]], which is a laboratory technique that uses sound waves to \"agitate particles\" in order to convert an electrical signal into a vibration which in turn breaks down a substance.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gillespie |first1=Clair |title=How Does Sonication Work |url=https://sciencing.com/sonication |website=Sciencing |accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref> In terms of starch grain analysis, the starch grains are released by use of an ultrasonic bath and the distilled water containing the sample particles is then [[centrifuged]]. This is the process in which the specimens are spun and separated by density as a result of [[centripetal force]], or due to the fictitious [[centrifugal force]] that is felt by the specimens due to their reference frame.<ref name=centrifuge>{{cite web |title=Centrifuge |url=https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/centrifuge |website=vocabulary.com}}</ref> Utilizing this force allows for the separation of [[solutions]] of different densities.<ref name=centrifuge /> Thus the least dense component, consisting of the starch grain particles is separated and a microscopic slide can be prepared.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes />\n\n====Starch Grain: Dental Calculus Removal Methods====\nStarch grain analysis through dental calculus can provide a plethora of information when it come to diet reconstruction of past societies.<ref name=Tao,etal. /> Specifically, dental calculus is a layering found on the teeth that is formed from [[Dental plaque|plaque]], \"after mineralization.\"<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes />\n\nIn a study conducted by Tao et. al, the research group followed the methods laid out by Piperno and Dillehay in 2008 and Li et al. in 2010.<ref name=Tao,etal. /> In these specific examples, they ground the dental calculus by use of [[mortar and pestle]], and centrifuged the mixture containing the dental calculus as well as small amounts of [[Calgon]] in order to break the particles into a dispersed state.<ref name=Tao,etal. /> Once the extracts were dissolved in [[hydrochloride]] and rinsed with [[acetone]], the residues were extracted and comparative analysis could begin.<ref name=Tao,etal. /> This is just one way in which to go about extracting starch grain residues from dental calculus, with another example being the use of sonification as described above.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes />\n\n====Starch Grain: Comparative Structures====\nThere are several structures that are observed when doing comparative analysis to determine the plant taxa in which the starch grain belongs. First, starting on a slightly larger scale, the granule types such as simple, compound, or semi-compound, sizes, and shapes are observed.<ref name=Clarissa>{{cite web |last1=Cagnato |first1=Clarissa |title=Starch Grain Analysis |url=clarissacagnato.weebly.com/starch-grain-analysis.html |website=Paleoethnobotany </ref> Next there is the [[hilum (botany)|hilum]], which is the area in which protein layers are deposited.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mozdy |first1=Michael |title=In the Tiny World of Starch Grains, Bigger is Better |website=Natural History Museum of Utah |publisher=NMHU Utah </ref> Hilums differ in their positioning on the starch granule and this positioning can differ between taxa.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> In addition to the hilum, \"lamellas\" are observed which are the different growth layers in which are only sometimes visible microscopically.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> The fissures can also be observed, however these are only common in some starch grains, not all.<ref name=Clarissa />\nIn total, starch grain analysis through the use of a computer database is the primary way in which starch grains are differentiated.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> This is helpful in terms of a supplemental approach to understanding plant exploitation of past societies. \n \n==Usefulness==\nStarch grain analysis is not a perfect science, however, plant starch grain analysis is a diagnostic feature of multiple applications according to the peculiarities and to the origin of the plant material.<ref name=\"CortellaPochettino1994\">{{cite journal |last1=Cortella |first1=A.

Factors such as heat and water absorption may affect the structure of the grains, making  identification more difficult. Even if the  remains are well preserved, water logging, dehydration, desiccation or damage from  fungi can destroy the starch. In some cases, even within the same species, starch grains can differ in shape and size and the size of the grain affects its survivability in the archaeological record.<ref>Field, J. Cosgrove, R.

Canberra. 228-238</ref>\n\n== Biology of starch ==\n{{see also|Starch#Energy store of plants}}\n[[Starch]] is produced in plants as a form of energy storage through the process of [[photosynthesis]]. When the plant is in need of energy, the stored starch is converted back into [[glucose]].<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|p=35,36}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Microscopy}}\n[[File:St\u00e4rkemehl 800 fach Polfilter.jpg|thumb|right|Starch, 800x magnified, under polarized light, showing characteristic [[extinction cross]]]]\nStarch grains are typically microscopically identified with either optical or electron microscopy. Starch grains can become clearer if they are stained a darker color with [[Iodine]] Stains. Logol's Iodine is one, used for [[staining]] starch because iodine reagents easily bind to starch but less easily to other materials. Features that allow identification of starch grains include:  presence of hilum (core of the grain), lamellae (or growth layers), birefringence, and extinction cross (a cross shape, visible on grains under revolving polarized light) which are visible with a [[microscope]] and shape and size.<ref name=\"Cagnato\" />\n\n===Low magnification===\nArchaeological research focused on residue adhering to [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] start at lower magnifications, commonly using a [[stereoscope]]. Most data obtained at this stage is [[Qualitative data|qualitative]], an important first stage to fuller analysis. Magnifications of between x10 and x50 are sufficient to locate target residues, describe features and confirm internal structures of the identified [[Residue (chemistry)|residues]].<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|p=47,48}}</ref>\n\n===High magnification===\nModern light, high powered [[microscope]]s have an internal light source, allowing illumination with both transmitted and reflected light. These microscopes can provide a magnification of up to x1000: good enough to provide clear images of starch [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] as small as a few micrometres in diameter.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|p=48,49}}</ref>\n\nStarch granules show different sizes. For example;\n* Tapioca starch: 5-35&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]]\n* Potato starch: 15-100&nbsp;\u00b5m\n* Maize starch: 5-25&nbsp;\u00b5m\n* Rice starch: 3-8&nbsp;\u00b5m\nbut all are generally under 100 micrometres in size, and are, therefore, best observed under compound microscopes equipped with various lighting conditions and magnifications from x200 to x800.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|p=47}}</ref>\n\nThe starch grains are also compared to standard reference collections for comparison. \nArchaeologists and researchers can consider four issues in classification of the plant(s) and its use(s): \n* Determination of whether evidence for the utilization of plants is present\n* Study of the assemblage variation\n* Determination of the presence of particular plant species\n* Assign percentages of starch granules within a sample to a particular [[taxon]], and present [[Numerical data|quantitative data]] regarding relative abundance within the sample. Identification of ancient starch is fairly easily for the first three levels of [[Taxonomy (biology)|classification]], whilst the fourth level requires continued improvement in the description, classification, and identification of individual starch granules.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|pp=115\u2013143}}</ref>\n\n== Starch in sediments ==\nStarch granules retrieved from [[sediment]]s are used to reconstruct the [[habitat]]s associated with human [[land use]]. Such studies address two areas of interest to the archaeologist:\n* [[landscapes]]; specifically the reconstruction of historical [[plant communities]] at the widest scale of the environment\n* specific contexts, such as [[Human settlement|settlements]] or activity areas; focusing on individual [[archaeological site]]s, or separate contexts within them, with the goal of identify specific human activities at a particular location.\nThe stages involved in the analysis of starch from sediments are; [[Core sample|sampling]], [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] of starch, [[Microscope slide#Mounting|slide mounting]] and viewing, and interpretation.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|p=145}}</ref>\n\n===Sampling===\nSampling a sediment core or stratigraphic profile to gather information about an environment requires a detailed understanding of the way the sediments were formed.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|pp=145\u2013151}}</ref>\n\n===Extraction===\nMost extraction techniques follow a general methodology of: \n* sample preparation (sieving, drying, or soaking)\n* [[wikt:disaggregation|disaggregation]] and [[wikt:deflocculation|deflocculation]] to break up the elements of the sample into single particles\n* removal of undesired particles (sands, silts, minerals, organics).\n* chemicals preservation of the starch granules.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|pp=151\u2013161}}</ref>\n\n===Slide mounting and viewing===\nStarch granules are mounted onto a slide, using a variety of [[Mounting media#Mounting media|mounting medias]] including, but not limited, to water, glycerol, and glycerine jelly. It is important that the material is dried thoroughly before being mounted to ensure that no further degradation of the sample occurs. \nThe slide is then viewed, as appropriate, for identification and counting.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|pp=161\u2013163}}</ref>\n\n===Interpretation===\nAfter the starch granules have been examined, the findings are then recorded and interpreted with respect to the research questions that are being investigated.\n\n== Starch on artifacts ==\nArtifacts collect starch granules and protect them from decay due to [[microorganisms]], thus providing excellent conditions for long-term preservation. The analysis may focus on the function of the tool, to examine a broader range of human behaviour but starch analysis also allows insights into craft activities involving the preparation of adhesives, medicines, or other nonfood items.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|pp=185\u2013189}}</ref>\n\n== Modified starch ==\nStarch can also be investigated when it is not in its raw form. For example, [[Modified starch]] is created when the morphological or physico-chemical structure of native starch is disrupted in some way, such as in [[food preparation]]. The most common way to modify starch is to apply heat. [[Earth oven|Cooking pits]], [[hearth#Archaeological features|hearths]], and ovens that may have come into contact with starchy material yield  modified starches which can provide other insights.\n\nModified starch is only likely to be preserved under specific conditions, such as [[arid|arid regions]] because of its susceptibility to organic decay. Studies of ancient modified starch aid understanding of ancient food technology, variations in cuisine among different [[social group]]s, as well as provide an understanding the function of ancient food-processing equipment.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|p=205}}</ref>\n\nPreserved forms of modified starch include:\n* Discrete desiccated macroremains: coherent foods that are not attached to any other object and are among the most easily recognizable ancient starchy prepared foodstuffs. They can be either the intended final prepared food, like loaves of bread, or intermediate products of the food processing sequence, like starch-rich, chaffy lumps{{clarify|date=May 2011}}.\n* Attached desiccated residues: collections of starchy foodstuffs adhered to a container or vessel. The ability to identify these residues is affected by the quantity and appearance of the residue, as well as the awareness of the excavators. Residues containing obvious plant tissue are most easily recognizable, while thin smears are not as easy to recognize.\n* Charred residues: normally the result of accidental overcooking and can be preserved as discrete fragments or remain stuck to the cooking vessel. Due to their charred nature, these residues are very difficult to identify.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Starch]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Hather, J.G.

This presents one downfall to the studying of plant taxa through starch grain analysis.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> Moving on, the ability for long term storage of starch grains for an energy source utilized by plants, makes starch grains a valuable source of study within an archaeological context.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> Starch is stored in the [[amyloplasts]], a specialized organelle found within plant cells, as starch grains.<ref name=Cortella>{{cite journal |last1=Cortella |first1=A.R. |last2=Pochettino |first2=M.L. |title=Starch Grain Anaalysis as a Microscopic Diagnostic Feature in the Identification  fo Plant Material |journal=JSTOR |date=January 4, 1994 |volume=Economic Botany 48(2) |issue=The New York Botanicl Garden Press |pages=171-181}}</ref> The starch grain is specifically important for study due to the fact that it is commonly found in most plants, its long-lasting nature, as well as the diverse forms and structures that they can take based on which taxa they belong to.<ref name=Cortella />\n\n==Starch Grain Lab Techniques==\n====Staining Solutions====\nStaining solutions are one way to make comparative analysis of starch granules more accesible, depending on what type of stain is specifically used. For example, as stated by Kov\u00e1rn\u00edk and Benes, [[Lugol's solution]] stains the grains a dark blue color, in order to distinguish the starch grain from other common structures that can appear similar in size and shape.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> In addition to this technique, the use of CongoRed dye marks the damage, making it easier to study, compare, and to anlayze differences in the damage of particular taxa. Specifically, the intensity of the red color depends on how damaged the grain is.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> Lastly, [[Trypan blue]] is another way to stain grain damage within starch grains, only staining the damaged grains, not the undamaged.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> Specifically, it can be important to incorporate the staining process into an analysis due to the fact that there are several other structures found naturally that have similar characteristics to starch when compared under a microscope.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes />  \n\n====Starch Extraction in the Context of Archaeological Tools====\nThere are several ways to go about extracting the starch granules from stone tools. One technique as explained by Kov\u00e1rnik and Benes described as the most common, is through pipetting the surface of the objects on the most common areas in which starch grains are found, for example fissures, or others divetts on the artifact.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> The water droplettes from the pipetting technique are then collected onto slides to be utilized in comparative analysis. This is a common technique for the use of understanding specifically how stone tools were used, and what types of plants were being exploited during the time being studied.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> \n\nAnother common approach is to dislodge the starch grains through [[sonication]], which is a labarotory technique that uses sound waves to \"agitate particles\" in order to convert an electrical signal into a vibration which in turn breaks down a substance.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gillespie |first1=Clair |title=How Does Sonication Work |url=https://sciencing.com/sonication |website=Sciencing |accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref> In terms of starch grain analysis, the starch grains are released by use of an ultrasonic bath and the distilled water containing the sample particles is then [[centrifuged]]. This is the process in which the specimens are spun and separated by density as a result of [[centripetal force]], or due to the ficticious [[centrifugal force]] that is felt by the specimens due to their reference frame.<ref name=centrifuge>{{cite web |title=Centrifuge |url=https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/centrifuge |website=vocabulary.com}}</ref> Utilizing this force allows for the seperation of [[solutions]] of different densities.<ref name=centrifuge /> Thus the least dense component, consisiting of the starch grain particles is seperated and a microscopic slide can be prepared.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes />\n\n====Starch Grain: Dental Calculus Removal Methods====\nStarch grain analysis through dental calculus can provide a plethora of information when it come to diet reconstruction of past societies.<ref name=Tao,etal. /> Specifically, dental calculus is a layering found on the teeth that is formed from [[Dental plaque|plaque]], \"after mineralization.\"<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes />\n\nIn a study conducted by Tao et. al, the research group followed the methods laid out by Piperno and Dillehay in 2008 and Li et al. in 2010.<ref name=Tao,etal. /> In these specific examples, they ground the dental calculus by use of [[mortar and pestle]], and centrifuged the mixture containing the dental calculus as well as small amounts of [[Calgon]] in order to break the particles into a dispersed state.<ref name=Tao,etal. /> Once the extracts were dissolved in [[hydrochloride]] and rinsed with [[acetone]], the residues were extracted and comparative analysis could begin.<ref name=Tao,etal. /> This is just one way in which to go about extracting starch grain residues from dental calculus, with another example being the use of sonification as described above.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes />\n\n====Starch Grain: Comparative Structures====\nThere are several structures that are observed when doing comparative analysis to determine the plant taxa in which the starch grain belongs. First, starting on a slightly larger scale, the granule types such as simple, compound, or semi-compound, sizes, and shapes are observed.<ref name=Clarissa>{{cite web |last1=Cagnato |first1=Clarissa |title=Starch Grain Analysis |url=clarissacagnato.weebly.com/starch-grain-analysis.html |website=Paleoethnobotany </ref> Next there is the [[hilum (botany)|hilum]], which is the area in which protein layers are deposited.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mozdy |first1=Michael |title=In the Tiny WOrld of Starch Grains, Bigger is Better |website=Natural History Museum of Utah |publisher=NMHU Utah </ref> Hilums differ in their positioning on the starch granule and this positioning can differ between taxa.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> In addition to the hilum, \"lamellas\" are observed which are the different growth layers in which are only sometimes visible microscopically.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> The fissures can also be observed, however these are only common in some starch grains, not all.<ref name=Clarissa />\nIn total, starch grain analysis through the use of a computer database is the primary way in which starch grains are differentiated.<ref name=Kov\u00e1rn\u00edl,Benes /> This is helpful in terms of a supplemental approach to understanding plant exploitation of past societies. \n \n==Usefulness==\nStarch grain analysis is not a perfect science, however, plant starch grain analysis is a diagnostic feature of multiple applications according to the peculiarities and to the origin of the plant material.<ref name=\"CortellaPochettino1994\">{{cite journal |last1=Cortella |first1=A.

Factors such as heat and water absorption may affect the structure of the grains, making  identification more difficult. Even if the  remains are well preserved, water logging, dehydration, desiccation or damage from  fungi can destroy the starch. In some cases, even within the same species, starch grains can differ in shape and size and the size of the grain affects its survivability in the archaeological record.<ref>Field, J. Cosgrove, R.

Canberra. 228-238</ref>\n\n== Biology of starch ==\n{{see also|Starch#Energy store of plants}}\n[[Starch]] is produced in plants as a form of energy storage through the process of [[photosynthesis]]. When the plant is in need of energy, the stored starch is converted back into [[glucose]].<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|p=35,36}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Microscopy}}\n[[File:St\u00e4rkemehl 800 fach Polfilter.jpg|thumb|right|Starch, 800x magnified, under polarized light, showing characteristic [[extinction cross]]]]\nStarch grains are typically microscopically identified with either optical or electron microscopy. Starch grains can become clearer if they are stained a darker color with [[Iodine]] Stains. Logol's Iodine is one, used for [[staining]] starch because iodine reagents easily bind to starch but less easily to other materials. Features that allow identification of starch grains include:  presence of hilum (core of the grain), lamellae (or growth layers), birefringence, and extinction cross (a cross shape, visible on grains under revolving polarized light) which are visible with a [[microscope]] and shape and size.<ref name=\"Cagnato\" />\n\n===Low magnification===\nArchaeological research focused on residue adhering to [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] start at lower magnifications, commonly using a [[stereoscope]]. Most data obtained at this stage is [[Qualitative data|qualitative]], an important first stage to fuller analysis. Magnifications of between x10 and x50 are sufficient to locate target residues, describe features and confirm internal structures of the identified [[Residue (chemistry)|residues]].<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|p=47,48}}</ref>\n\n===High magnification===\nModern light, high powered [[microscope]]s have an internal light source, allowing illumination with both transmitted and reflected light. These microscopes can provide a magnification of up to x1000: good enough to provide clear images of starch [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] as small as a few micrometres in diameter.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|p=48,49}}</ref>\n\nStarch granules show different sizes. For example;\n* Tapioca starch: 5-35&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]]\n* Potato starch: 15-100&nbsp;\u00b5m\n* Maize starch: 5-25&nbsp;\u00b5m\n* Rice starch: 3-8&nbsp;\u00b5m\nbut all are generally under 100 micrometres in size, and are, therefore, best observed under compound microscopes equipped with various lighting conditions and magnifications from x200 to x800.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|p=47}}</ref>\n\nThe starch grains are also compared to standard reference collections for comparison. \nArchaeologists and researchers can consider four issues in classification of the plant(s) and its use(s): \n* Determination of whether evidence for the utilization of plants is present\n* Study of the assemblage variation\n* Determination of the presence of particular plant species\n* Assign percentages of starch granules within a sample to a particular [[taxon]], and present [[Numerical data|quantitative data]] regarding relative abundance within the sample. Identification of ancient starch is fairly easily for the first three levels of [[Taxonomy (biology)|classification]], whilst the fourth level requires continued improvement in the description, classification, and identification of individual starch granules.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|pp=115\u2013143}}</ref>\n\n== Starch in sediments ==\nStarch granules retrieved from [[sediment]]s are used to reconstruct the [[habitat]]s associated with human [[land use]]. Such studies address two areas of interest to the archaeologist:\n* [[landscapes]]; specifically the reconstruction of historical [[plant communities]] at the widest scale of the environment\n* specific contexts, such as [[Human settlement|settlements]] or activity areas; focusing on individual [[archaeological site]]s, or separate contexts within them, with the goal of identify specific human activities at a particular location.\nThe stages involved in the analysis of starch from sediments are; [[Core sample|sampling]], [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] of starch, [[Microscope slide#Mounting|slide mounting]] and viewing, and interpretation.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|p=145}}</ref>\n\n===Sampling===\nSampling a sediment core or stratigraphic profile to gather information about an environment requires a detailed understanding of the way the sediments were formed.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|pp=145\u2013151}}</ref>\n\n===Extraction===\nMost extraction techniques follow a general methodology of: \n* sample preparation (sieving, drying, or soaking)\n* [[wikt:disaggregation|disaggregation]] and [[wikt:deflocculation|deflocculation]] to break up the elements of the sample into single particles\n* removal of undesired particles (sands, silts, minerals, organics).\n* chemicals preservation of the starch granules.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|pp=151\u2013161}}</ref>\n\n===Slide mounting and viewing===\nStarch granules are mounted onto a slide, using a variety of [[Mounting media#Mounting media|mounting medias]] including, but not limited, to water, glycerol, and glycerine jelly. It is important that the material is dried thoroughly before being mounted to ensure that no further degradation of the sample occurs. \nThe slide is then viewed, as appropriate, for identification and counting.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|pp=161\u2013163}}</ref>\n\n===Interpretation===\nAfter the starch granules have been examined, the findings are then recorded and interpreted with respect to the research questions that are being investigated.\n\n== Starch on artifacts ==\nArtifacts collect starch granules and protect them from decay due to [[microorganisms]], thus providing excellent conditions for long-term preservation. The analysis may focus on the function of the tool, to examine a broader range of human behaviour but starch analysis also allows insights into craft activities involving the preparation of adhesives, medicines, or other nonfood items.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|pp=185\u2013189}}</ref>\n\n== Modified starch ==\nStarch can also be investigated when it is not in its raw form. For example, [[Modified starch]] is created when the morphological or physico-chemical structure of native starch is disrupted in some way, such as in [[food preparation]]. The most common way to modify starch is to apply heat. [[Earth oven|Cooking pits]], [[hearth#Archaeological features|hearths]], and ovens that may have come into contact with starchy material yield  modified starches which can provide other insights.\n\nModified starch is only likely to be preserved under specific conditions, such as [[arid|arid regions]] because of its susceptibility to organic decay. Studies of ancient modified starch aid understanding of ancient food technology, variations in cuisine among different [[social group]]s, as well as provide an understanding the function of ancient food-processing equipment.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|p=205}}</ref>\n\nPreserved forms of modified starch include:\n* Discrete desiccated macroremains: coherent foods that are not attached to any other object and are among the most easily recognizable ancient starchy prepared foodstuffs. They can be either the intended final prepared food, like loaves of bread, or intermediate products of the food processing sequence, like starch-rich, chaffy lumps{{clarify|date=May 2011}}.\n* Attached desiccated residues: collections of starchy foodstuffs adhered to a container or vessel. The ability to identify these residues is affected by the quantity and appearance of the residue, as well as the awareness of the excavators. Residues containing obvious plant tissue are most easily recognizable, while thin smears are not as easy to recognize.\n* Charred residues: normally the result of accidental overcooking and can be preserved as discrete fragments or remain stuck to the cooking vessel. Due to their charred nature, these residues are very difficult to identify.<ref>{{harvnb|Torrence|2006|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Starch]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Hather, J.G.

In addition to being worn as an undershirt, it is also often worn at home due to its effectiveness in providing relief from the country's humid climate.\n\nIn [[Bengal]], it is called a '''sando-genji''' or just '''genji'''. In much of [[India]], it is known as a '''banian''' and is used extensively as an undershirt to absorb sweat and prevent its penetration to outer layers of clothing. \n\nIn addition to athletic usage, tank tops have traditionally been used as undershirts, especially with suits and dress shirts. They are sometimes worn alone without a dress shirt or top shirt during very warm and/or humid weather, mainly in North America where the climate is warmer and more humid in the summer. Tank tops are often worn alone under very casual settings, as lounge wear, and/or while completing yard work or other chores around the home.\n\n[[File:Indian lady in sleeveless top.png|thumb|240px|A woman wearing sleeveless top.]]\n\nThe build of a tank top is simple: the neck and armholes are often reinforced for durability. One usually has large armholes and neck holes and a neckline that can reach down as far as the bottom of the chest. (Women's tank tops have smaller holes, to conceal their [[breast]]s). They are also sometimes made long to make tucking into a pair of [[jeans]]/[[shorts]] easier. In almost all cases, they are buttonless, collarless, and pocketless. A tank top worn as an undershirt is designed for a tight fit and is often made of [[Ribbing (knitting)|ribbed]] [[cotton]].\n\nA tank top consists of a sleeveless shirt with low neck and different shoulder straps width.

In France, it is commonly called a '''marcel''' after Marcel Eisenberg, who first started large-scale production of the shirts for [[Paris]]ian [[Material handling|porters]] during the mid-19th century, or more formally a '''d\u00e9bardeur''', meaning \"docker\", \"porter\" or \"[[stevedore]]\".\n\nIn [[Russia]], it is generally referred as '''Mayka''',<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.endic.ru/ozhegov/Majka-14946.html | title=definition of \u041c\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430 at Ojegov's Dictionary | publisher=endic.ru | accessdate=9 November 2019}} </ref> but is also known as '''Alcoholichka'''.\n\nIn the Philippines, a sleeveless shirt is called a '''sando'''. In addition to being worn as an undershirt, it is also often worn at home due to its effectiveness in providing relief from the country's humid climate.\n\nIn [[Bengal]], it is called a '''sando-genji''' or just '''genji'''. In much of [[India]], it is known as a '''banian''' and is used extensively as an undershirt to absorb sweat and prevent its penetration to outer layers of clothing. \n\nIn addition to athletic usage, tank tops have traditionally been used as undershirts, especially with suits and dress shirts. They are sometimes worn alone without a dress shirt or top shirt during very warm and/or humid weather, mainly in North America where the climate is warmer and more humid in the summer. Tank tops are often worn alone under very casual settings, as lounge wear, and/or while completing yard work or other chores around the home.\n\n[[File:Indian lady in sleeveless top.png|thumb|240px|A woman wearing sleeveless top.]]\n\nThe build of a tank top is simple: the neck and armholes are often reinforced for durability. One usually has large armholes and neck holes and a neckline that can reach down as far as the bottom of the chest. (Women's tank tops have smaller holes, to conceal their [[breast]]s). They are also sometimes made long to make tucking into a pair of [[jeans]]/[[shorts]] easier. In almost all cases, they are buttonless, collarless, and pocketless. A tank top worn as an undershirt is designed for a tight fit and is often made of [[Ribbing (knitting)|ribbed]] [[cotton]].\n\nA tank top consists of a sleeveless shirt with low neck and different shoulder straps width. It is named after ''[[Maillot|tank suits]]'', one-piece bathing suits of the 1920s worn in tanks or swimming pools.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tank+top | title=definition of tank top by The Free Dictionary | publisher=Farlex | accessdate=June 5, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606033329/http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tank+top | archive-date=June 6, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> The upper garment is worn commonly by both men and women.\n\nIn the UK, a tank top is the local name for a ''sleeveless jersey''.\n\n===Camisole===\n{{Main|Camisole}}\n[[File:Tank top.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[camisole]] being used as a blouse.]]\n\nA camisole, also called just '''cami''', is a sleeveless [[undergarment]] for women, normally extending to the waist. They often have [[spaghetti strap]]s. Originally worn as an undershirt, like the A-shirt they have become increasingly used as warm-weather outerwear. The camisole is usually made of satin, nylon, or cotton.\n\n===Dudou===\n{{main|Dudou|Y\u1ebfm}}\nA [[dudou]] (\"belly cover\"), known as a [[y\u1ebfm|yem]] in [[Vietnamese clothing|Vietnamese]] contexts, is an item of [[Chinese clothing|East Asian]] and [[Vietnamese clothing|Southeast Asian]] clothing resembling a [[silk]] [[apron]] or [[bib (garment)|bib]] but traditionally used as an [[undershirt]] or [[bodice]] to flatten the figure and, [[traditional Chinese medicine|medicinally]], to preserve [[stomach]] ''[[qi]]''. Beginning around the year 2000, Western and Chinese fashion has also begun incorporating them as a sleeveless and backless shirt for women.\n\n===Halter top===\n{{Main|Halterneck}}\nA halter top is a sleeveless shirt in which a strap goes around the back of the neck, leaving the upper back uncovered. Halter tops are worn mainly by girls and women.\n\n===Muscle shirt===\nA sleeveless T-shirt, also called a '''muscle shirt''', is the same design as a [[T-shirt]], but without sleeves. Some sleeveless T-shirts, which possess smaller, narrower arm holes, can be worn by both women and men, but those with larger, wider arm holes are primarily worn by men, since the larger arm holes would expose the female [[breast]] under certain circumstances. They are often worn during athletic activities or as casual wear during warmer weather. They are colloquially known as '''shooter shirts''' in the southern United States. They were quite popular in the 1980s and were commonly associated with surfers and [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilder]]s (hence the name \"muscle\" shirt) and often bore the names and logos of gyms.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Such shirts without logos are now more commonly worn as casual wear.\n\n===Tube top===\n{{Main|Tube top}}\nA '''tube top''' is a shirt with no sleeves or shoulders, essentially a tube that wraps around a woman's torso.

Most steels with more than 2.5% carbon content are made using [[powder metallurgy]].\n\n==Heat treatment==\n[[File:Heat transfer steel diag2.png|thumb|right|Iron-carbon [[phase diagram]], showing the temperature and carbon ranges for certain types of heat treatments.]]\n{{main|Heat treatment}}\n\nThe purpose of heat treating carbon steel is to change the mechanical properties of steel, usually ductility, hardness, yield strength, or impact resistance. Note that the electrical and thermal conductivity are only slightly altered. As with most strengthening techniques for steel, [[Young's modulus]] (elasticity) is unaffected. All treatments of steel trade ductility for increased strength and vice versa. Iron has a higher solubility for carbon in the [[austenite]] phase; therefore all heat treatments, except spheroidizing and process annealing, start by heating the steel to a temperature at which the austenitic phase can exist. The steel is then quenched (heat drawn out) at a moderate to low rate allowing carbon to diffuse out of the austenite forming iron-carbide (cementite) and leaving ferrite, or at a high rate, trapping the carbon within the iron thus forming martensite. The rate at which the steel is cooled through the [[eutectoid]] temperature (about 727&nbsp;\u00b0C) affects the rate at which carbon diffuses out of austenite and forms cementite. Generally speaking, cooling swiftly will leave iron carbide finely dispersed and produce a fine grained [[pearlite]] and cooling slowly will give a coarser pearlite. Cooling a hypoeutectoid steel (less than 0.77 wt% C) results in a lamellar-pearlitic structure of iron carbide layers with \u03b1-[[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] (nearly pure iron) between. If it is hypereutectoid steel (more than 0.77 wt% C) then the structure is full pearlite with small grains (larger than the pearlite lamella) of [[cementite]] formed on the grain boundaries. A eutectoid steel (0.77% carbon) will have a pearlite structure throughout the grains with no cementite at the boundaries. The relative amounts of constituents are found using the [[lever rule]]. The following is a list of the types of heat treatments possible:\n\n*'''Spheroidizing''': Spheroidite forms when carbon steel is heated to approximately 700&nbsp;\u00b0C for over 30 hours. Spheroidite can form at lower temperatures but the time needed drastically increases, as this is a diffusion-controlled process. The result is a structure of rods or spheres of cementite within primary structure (ferrite or pearlite, depending on which side of the eutectoid you are on). The purpose is to soften higher carbon steels and allow more formability. This is the softest and most ductile form of steel.<ref>Smith, p. 388</ref>\n*'''[[Annealing (metallurgy)|Full annealing]]''': Carbon steel is heated to approximately 40&nbsp;\u00b0C above Ac3{{?}} or Acm{{?}} for 1 hour; this ensures all the [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] transforms into [[austenite]] (although [[cementite]] might still exist if the carbon content is greater than the eutectoid). The steel must then be cooled slowly, in the realm of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (36&nbsp;\u00b0F) per hour. Usually it is just furnace cooled, where the furnace is turned off with the steel still inside. This results in a coarse pearlitic structure, which means the \"bands\" of [[pearlite]] are thick.<ref name=Alvarenga>{{cite journal |vauthors=Alvarenga HD, Van de Putte T, Van Steenberge N, Sietsma J, Terryn H |title=Influence of Carbide Morphology and Microstructure on the Kinetics of Superficial Decarburization of C-Mn Steels |journal=Metall Mater Trans A |volume=46 |pages=123\u2013133 |date=Apr 2009 |doi=10.1007/s11661-014-2600-y }}</ref> Fully annealed steel is soft and [[ductile]], with no internal stresses, which is often necessary for cost-effective forming. Only spheroidized steel is softer and more ductile.<ref>Smith, p. 386</ref>\n*'''Process annealing''': A process used to relieve stress in a cold-worked carbon steel with less than 0.3% C. The steel is usually heated to 550\u2013650&nbsp;\u00b0C for 1 hour, but sometimes temperatures as high as 700&nbsp;\u00b0C. The image rightward{{clarify|date=June 2016}} shows the area where process annealing occurs.\n*'''Isothermal annealing''': It is a process in which hypoeutectoid steel is heated above the upper critical temperature. This temperature is maintained for a time and then reduced to below the lower critical temperature and is again maintained. It is then cooled to room temperature. This method eliminates any temperature gradient.\n*'''Normalizing''': Carbon steel is heated to approximately 55&nbsp;\u00b0C above Ac3 or Acm for 1 hour; this ensures the steel completely transforms to austenite. The steel is then air-cooled, which is a cooling rate of approximately {{convert|38|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} per minute. This results in a fine pearlitic structure, and a more-uniform structure. Normalized steel has a higher strength than annealed steel; it has a relatively high strength and hardness.<ref>Smith, pp. 386\u2013387</ref>\n*'''[[Quenching]]''': Carbon steel with at least 0.4 wt% C is heated to normalizing temperatures and then rapidly cooled (quenched) in water, brine, or oil to the critical temperature. The critical temperature is dependent on the carbon content, but as a general rule is lower as the carbon content increases. This results in a martensitic structure; a form of steel that possesses a super-saturated carbon content in a deformed body-centered cubic (BCC) crystalline structure, properly termed body-centered tetragonal (BCT), with much internal stress. Thus quenched steel is extremely hard but [[brittle]], usually too brittle for practical purposes. These internal stresses may cause stress cracks on the surface. Quenched steel is approximately three times harder (four with more carbon) than normalized steel.<ref>Smith, pp. 373\u2013377</ref>\n*'''[[Martempering]] (Marquenching)''': Martempering is not actually a tempering procedure, hence the term \"marquenching\". It is a form of isothermal heat treatment applied after an initial quench, typically in a molten salt bath, at a temperature just above the \"martensite start temperature\". At this temperature, residual stresses within the material are relieved and some bainite may be formed from the retained austenite which did not have time to transform into anything else. In industry, this is a process used to control the ductility and hardness of a material. With longer marquenching, the ductility increases with a minimal loss in strength; the steel is held in this solution until the inner and outer temperatures of the part equalize. Then the steel is cooled at a moderate speed to keep the temperature gradient minimal. Not only does this process reduce internal stresses and stress cracks, but it also increases the impact resistance.<ref>Smith, pp. 389\u2013390</ref>\n*'''[[Tempering (metallurgy)|Tempering]]''': This is the most common heat treatment encountered, because the final properties can be precisely determined by the temperature and time of the tempering. Tempering involves reheating quenched steel to a temperature below the [[eutectoid]] temperature then cooling. The elevated temperature allows very small amounts of spheroidite to form, which restores ductility, but reduces hardness. Actual temperatures and times are carefully chosen for each composition.<ref>Smith, pp. 387\u2013388</ref>\n*'''[[Austempering]]''': The austempering process is the same as martempering, except the quench is interrupted and the steel is held in the molten salt bath at temperatures between 205&nbsp;\u00b0C and 540&nbsp;\u00b0C, and then cooled at a moderate rate. The resulting steel, called bainite, produces an acicular microstructure in the steel that has great strength (but less than martensite), greater ductility, higher impact resistance, and less distortion than martensite steel. The disadvantage of austempering is it can be used only on a few steels, and it requires a special salt bath.<ref>Smith, p. 391</ref>\n\n==Case hardening==\n{{main|Case hardening}}\nCase hardening processes harden only the exterior of the steel part, creating a hard, wear resistant skin (the \"case\") but preserving a tough and ductile interior. Carbon steels are not very [[hardenability|hardenable]] meaning they can not be hardened throughout thick sections. Alloy steels have a better hardenability, so they can be through-hardened and do not require case hardening. This property of carbon steel can be beneficial, because it gives the surface good wear characteristics but leaves the core tough.\n\n==Forging temperature of steel==\n<ref name=Mat_hand>{{cite book|last=Brady|first=George S.|title=Materials Handbook|year=1997|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-07-007084-9|edition=14th|author2=Clauser, Henry R.|author3=Vaccari A., John|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/materialshandboo14geor}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Note that the electrical and thermal conductivity are only slightly altered. As with most strengthening techniques for steel, [[Young's modulus]] (elasticity) is unaffected. All treatments of steel trade ductility for increased strength and vice versa. Iron has a higher solubility for carbon in the [[austenite]] phase; therefore all heat treatments, except spheroidizing and process annealing, start by heating the steel to a temperature at which the austenitic phase can exist. The steel is then quenched (heat drawn out) at a moderate to low rate allowing carbon to diffuse out of the austenite forming iron-carbide (cementite) and leaving ferrite, or at a high rate, trapping the carbon within the iron thus forming martensite. The rate at which the steel is cooled through the [[eutectoid]] temperature (about 727&nbsp;\u00b0C) affects the rate at which carbon diffuses out of austenite and forms cementite. Generally speaking, cooling swiftly will leave iron carbide finely dispersed and produce a fine grained [[pearlite]] and cooling slowly will give a coarser pearlite. Cooling a hypoeutectoid steel (less than 0.77 wt% C) results in a lamellar-pearlitic structure of iron carbide layers with \u03b1-[[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] (nearly pure iron) between. If it is hypereutectoid steel (more than 0.77 wt% C) then the structure is full pearlite with small grains (larger than the pearlite lamella) of [[cementite]] formed on the grain boundaries. A eutectoid steel (0.77% carbon) will have a pearlite structure throughout the grains with no cementite at the boundaries. The relative amounts of constituents are found using the [[lever rule]]. The following is a list of the types of heat treatments possible:\n\n*'''Spheroidizing''': Spheroidite forms when carbon steel is heated to approximately 700&nbsp;\u00b0C for over 30 hours. Spheroidite can form at lower temperatures but the time needed drastically increases, as this is a diffusion-controlled process. The result is a structure of rods or spheres of cementite within primary structure (ferrite or pearlite, depending on which side of the eutectoid you are on). The purpose is to soften higher carbon steels and allow more formability. This is the softest and most ductile form of steel. The adjacent image shows where spheroidizing usually occurs.<ref>Smith, p. 388</ref>\n*'''[[Annealing (metallurgy)|Full annealing]]''': Carbon steel is heated to approximately 40&nbsp;\u00b0C above Ac3{{?}} or Acm{{?}} for 1 hour; this ensures all the [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] transforms into [[austenite]] (although [[cementite]] might still exist if the carbon content is greater than the eutectoid). The steel must then be cooled slowly, in the realm of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (36&nbsp;\u00b0F) per hour. Usually it is just furnace cooled, where the furnace is turned off with the steel still inside. This results in a coarse pearlitic structure, which means the \"bands\" of [[pearlite]] are thick.<ref name=Alvarenga>{{cite journal |vauthors=Alvarenga HD, Van de Putte T, Van Steenberge N, Sietsma J, Terryn H |title=Influence of Carbide Morphology and Microstructure on the Kinetics of Superficial Decarburization of C-Mn Steels |journal=Metall Mater Trans A |volume=46 |pages=123\u2013133 |date=Apr 2009 |doi=10.1007/s11661-014-2600-y }}</ref> Fully annealed steel is soft and [[ductile]], with no internal stresses, which is often necessary for cost-effective forming. Only spheroidized steel is softer and more ductile.<ref>Smith, p. 386</ref>\n*'''Process annealing''': A process used to relieve stress in a cold-worked carbon steel with less than 0.3% C. The steel is usually heated to 550\u2013650&nbsp;\u00b0C for 1 hour, but sometimes temperatures as high as 700&nbsp;\u00b0C. The image rightward{{clarify|date=June 2016}} shows the area where process annealing occurs.\n*'''Isothermal annealing''': It is a process in which hypoeutectoid steel is heated above the upper critical temperature. This temperature is maintained for a time and then reduced to below the lower critical temperature and is again maintained. It is then cooled to room temperature. This method eliminates any temperature gradient.\n*'''Normalizing''': Carbon steel is heated to approximately 55&nbsp;\u00b0C above Ac3 or Acm for 1 hour; this ensures the steel completely transforms to austenite. The steel is then air-cooled, which is a cooling rate of approximately {{convert|38|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} per minute. This results in a fine pearlitic structure, and a more-uniform structure. Normalized steel has a higher strength than annealed steel; it has a relatively high strength and hardness.<ref>Smith, pp. 386\u2013387</ref>\n*'''[[Quenching]]''': Carbon steel with at least 0.4 wt% C is heated to normalizing temperatures and then rapidly cooled (quenched) in water, brine, or oil to the critical temperature. The critical temperature is dependent on the carbon content, but as a general rule is lower as the carbon content increases. This results in a martensitic structure; a form of steel that possesses a super-saturated carbon content in a deformed body-centered cubic (BCC) crystalline structure, properly termed body-centered tetragonal (BCT), with much internal stress. Thus quenched steel is extremely hard but [[brittle]], usually too brittle for practical purposes. These internal stresses may cause stress cracks on the surface. Quenched steel is approximately three times harder (four with more carbon) than normalized steel.<ref>Smith, pp. 373\u2013377</ref>\n*'''[[Martempering]] (Marquenching)''': Martempering is not actually a tempering procedure, hence the term \"marquenching\". It is a form of isothermal heat treatment applied after an initial quench, typically in a molten salt bath, at a temperature just above the \"martensite start temperature\". At this temperature, residual stresses within the material are relieved and some bainite may be formed from the retained austenite which did not have time to transform into anything else. In industry, this is a process used to control the ductility and hardness of a material. With longer marquenching, the ductility increases with a minimal loss in strength; the steel is held in this solution until the inner and outer temperatures of the part equalize. Then the steel is cooled at a moderate speed to keep the temperature gradient minimal. Not only does this process reduce internal stresses and stress cracks, but it also increases the impact resistance.<ref>Smith, pp. 389\u2013390</ref>\n*'''[[Tempering (metallurgy)|Tempering]]''': This is the most common heat treatment encountered, because the final properties can be precisely determined by the temperature and time of the tempering. Tempering involves reheating quenched steel to a temperature below the [[eutectoid]] temperature then cooling. The elevated temperature allows very small amounts of spheroidite to form, which restores ductility, but reduces hardness. Actual temperatures and times are carefully chosen for each composition.<ref>Smith, pp. 387\u2013388</ref>\n*'''[[Austempering]]''': The austempering process is the same as martempering, except the quench is interrupted and the steel is held in the molten salt bath at temperatures between 205&nbsp;\u00b0C and 540&nbsp;\u00b0C, and then cooled at a moderate rate. The resulting steel, called bainite, produces an acicular microstructure in the steel that has great strength (but less than martensite), greater ductility, higher impact resistance, and less distortion than martensite steel. The disadvantage of austempering is it can be used only on a few steels, and it requires a special salt bath.<ref>Smith, p. 391</ref>\n\n==Case hardening==\n{{main|Case hardening}}\nCase hardening processes harden only the exterior of the steel part, creating a hard, wear resistant skin (the \"case\") but preserving a tough and ductile interior. Carbon steels are not very [[hardenability|hardenable]] meaning they can not be hardened throughout thick sections. Alloy steels have a better hardenability, so they can be through-hardened and do not require case hardening. This property of carbon steel can be beneficial, because it gives the surface good wear characteristics but leaves the core tough.\n\n==Forging temperature of steel==\n<ref name=Mat_hand>{{cite book|last=Brady|first=George S.|title=Materials Handbook|year=1997|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-07-007084-9|edition=14th|author2=Clauser, Henry R.|author3=Vaccari A., John|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/materialshandboo14geor}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
