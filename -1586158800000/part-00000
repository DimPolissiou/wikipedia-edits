The stories formed the basis for [[Sharpe (TV series)|an ITV television series]] featuring [[Sean Bean]] in the title role.\n\nCornwell's series is composed of several novels and short stories, and charts Sharpe's progress in the [[British Army]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He begins in ''[[Sharpe's Tiger]]'' as a [[private (rank)|private]] in the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|33rd Regiment of Foot]] who becomes a sergeant by the end of the book; he is an ensign in the [[74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot|74th Regiment]] during ''[[Sharpe's Trafalgar]]'' who is transferred to the newly formed [[95th Rifles]] as a second lieutenant. He is gradually promoted through the ranks, finally becoming a [[lieutenant colonel]] in ''[[Sharpe's Waterloo]]''.\n\nThe character of Sharpe is born a guttersnipe in the [[Rookery (slum)|rookeries]] of London, and the stories dramatize his struggle for acceptance and respect from his fellow officers and from the men whom he commands. He is commissioned an officer on the battlefield and has to fight class prejudice in an army where an officer's rank is often [[Sale of commissions|bought]]. He is an experienced soldier, unlike many of the officers with whom he serves. His adventures result in his improbable presence at nearly every important event in the British Empire at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries.\n\nSharpe is described as \"brilliant but wayward\" in ''[[Sharpe's Sword]]'', and he is portrayed by the author as a \"loose cannon\". He is a highly skilled leader of light troops who takes part in a range of historical events during the Napoleonic Wars and other conflicts, including the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. He is considered dangerous to have as an enemy; he is a skilled marksman and grows to be a good swordsman. The books were published in non-chronological order, but in most of them he is a rifle officer armed with a [[1796 Heavy Cavalry Sword]] and a [[Baker rifle]], although he has also acquired a pistol by ''[[Sharpe's Waterloo]]''. He is described as being six feet tall with an angular, tanned face, long black hair, and blue eyes. His most obvious physical characteristic is a deep scar on his right cheek which pulls at his right eye, giving his face a mocking expression when relaxed; this disappears when he smiles, which is not too frequently. By the end of the series, he has had two wives and three children.\n\n==Early years==\nRichard Sharpe was born in [[London]] circa 26 June 1777 (he believes that he may be 22 during the early months of 1799) to a prostitute residing in \"Cat Lane\", and a French smuggler. When Sharpe is three, his mother is killed in the [[Gordon Riots]], leaving him an orphan.\n\nWith no other known relatives to claim him, Sharpe is deposited in Jem Hocking's foundling home at Brewhouse Lane, [[Wapping]], where he spends his days picking his assigned quota of [[oakum]]. He is malnourished and regularly beaten, resulting in his being undersized for his age. Because of this, he is eventually sold to a master [[chimney sweep]] to train as an apprentice at the relatively late age of 12. Fearing the high mortality rate among apprentice sweeps (who are forced to climb inside chimneys and remove the soot by hand), Sharpe flees to the [[Rookery (slum)|Rookery]] of [[St Giles, London|St Giles]] (a form of slum), and is taken in by prostitute (and later bar-owner) Maggie Joyce. He stays under Maggie's protection for three years, learning various forms of thieving.\n\nAfter killing a gang leader during a fight over Maggie, he escapes from [[London]] to [[Yorkshire]] at the age of fifteen (by creating this back story, [[Bernard Cornwell]] made the actor Sean Bean's Yorkshire accent part of the [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] of the series). It is possible that Sharpe learned to play cricket in Yorkshire, as in ''[[Sharpe's Waterloo]]'' the Duke of Wellington attests that \"Sharpe bowls fiendish\". He also plays while training with the Rifles at [[Shorncliffe Redoubt]] (''[[Sharpe's Fury]])''.\n\nWithin six months of his arrival in Yorkshire, Sharpe kills a second man, the landlord of the tavern where he is working, in a fight over a local girl.\n\nTo avoid arrest, Sharpe takes the \"[[King's shilling]]\", joining the [[33rd Regiment of Foot|33rd Foot]], as a result of the blandishments of [[recruiting sergeant]] [[Obadiah Hakeswill]]. The regiment (popularly known as \"The Havercakes\", due to the [[oatcake]] the recruiting sergeants display on their bayonets to attract hungry potential recruits) is first sent to [[Flanders]] in 1794, where Sharpe fights in his first battle, at [[Battle of Boxtel|Boxtel]]. The next year, he and his regiment are posted to [[India]] under the command of the [[British East India Company]].\n\n==India==\nIn 1799, Sharpe is sentenced to 2,000 lashes (effectively a death sentence) for striking a sergeant, with the connivance of his company commander, [[List of Sharpe series characters#Charles Morris|Captain Charles Morris]], but is released after only 200 by executive order (''[[Sharpe's Tiger]]''). He is assigned to accompany Lieutenant [[William Lawford]] on a secret mission to rescue Lawford's uncle, head of [[British East India Company]] intelligence, Colonel Hector McCandless. They join the [[Tippoo Sultan]]'s army, posing as British deserters, but are later exposed and imprisoned. Lawford teaches Sharpe to read and write while they languish in the Tippoo's dungeon. Sharpe escapes during the [[Siege of Seringapatam (1799)|Siege of Seringapatam]] and destroys a mine meant to devastate the British army. He then kills the Tippoo Sultan unobserved and steals a fortune of jewels from the corpse. He is promoted to [[sergeant]] for his efforts.\n\nSharpe serves four uneventful years as a sergeant. In 1803, he is the sole survivor of a massacre of the garrison of a small fort carried out by a [[turncoat]] Company officer, [[William Dodd (fiction)|William Dodd]] (''[[Sharpe's Triumph]]''). As a result, he is taken by McCandless on a mission to identify and capture Dodd. Their search takes them first to the siege of [[Ahmednuggur]] and then the [[Battle of Assaye]]. At Assaye, the greatly outnumbered British force is commanded by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] (the future Duke of Wellington). When Wellesley's orderly is killed in the early stages of the battle, Sharpe takes his place, and so is at hand when Wellesley is unhorsed alone and among the enemy.  Sharpe single-handedly saves the general's life, killing numerous soldiers and holding the rest at bay until help finally arrives. He is rewarded with a [[battlefield commission]] for this act of bravery and joins the [[74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot|74th Regiment]] as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]].\n\nBoth Sharpe and his new colleagues find it difficult to adjust to Sharpe's new status and role, and his superiors in the 74th arrange for him to be transferred to the newly formed [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|95th Rifles Regiment]]. Before leaving India, he takes part in the assault on [[Gawilghur]], commanding troops in action for the first time. Once inside the fortress, Sharpe finally confronts Dodd and kills him, receiving a scar on his right cheek (''[[Sharpe's Fortress]]'').\n\n==Campaigns in Europe==\nWhile travelling from India to England to take up his post in the 95th Rifles, in 1805, Sharpe is caught up in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], his first direct encounter with [[France]] and its European allies as an Infantry officer. On the journey he also meets and falls in love with Lady Grace Hale, the wife of a politician (''[[Sharpe's Trafalgar]]'').\n\nGrace sets up home with Sharpe at [[Shorncliffe, Kent|Shorncliffe]], but dies giving birth to their child, who survives her by only a few hours. Sharpe's fortune is assumed by the lawyers to be part of Grace's estate and seized.  Sharpe falls into a deep depression, worsened by conflict with other officers in the Rifles, who relegate him to the role of [[quartermaster]], and leave him behind when the regiment is posted to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] in 1807. Sharpe, unable to sell his commission, plans to desert.  He returns to [[Wapping]] to rob and kill Jem Hocking, the abusive master of the foundling home where Sharpe was raised. Before Sharpe can disappear with the stolen cash, he encounters [[Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet|General Baird]], a former colleague from India, who recruits him to protect John Lavisser, a Foreign Office agent sent to negotiate with the Danish [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Crown Prince]]. Lavisser betrays Sharpe, and forces him into hiding in [[Copenhagen]], where he witnesses the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|bombardment of the city]] and the British capture of the [[Denmark|Danish]] fleet (''[[Sharpe's Prey]]''). In ''Sharpe's Prey'', Sharpe is now referred to as a second lieutenant because, as a light infantry unit of the British army, there are no [[Colours, standards and guidons|Colours]] and thus no ensigns in the Rifles.\n\n[[File:2 95th riflemen in various fighting stances.JPG|thumb|200px|95th Rifles [[Historical reenactment|reenactors]].]]\n\nIn ''[[Sharpe's Rifles]]'', Sharpe is said to have fought against the French in Portugal at [[Battle of Roli\u00e7a|Roli\u00e7a]] and [[Battle of Vimeiro|Vimeiro]], both in August 1808. Sharpe is now a lieutenant in the 95th Rifles, having been promoted, most likely thanks to seniority. This view is further supported by the promotion of Warren Dunnett. In ''Sharpe's Prey'', Dunnett is a captain, while in ''Sharpe's Rifles'', Dunnett is a major. This means that the old major of the Second Battalion in the 95th Rifles died in 1807. Dunnett, being the senior captain, took his place. The senior lieutenant in the battalion became a captain and Sharpe, as the senior second lieutenant, became a lieutenant. The promotion takes place after ''Sharpe's Prey'', but before ''Sharpe's Rifles''.\n\nBy early 1809, Sharpe is in [[Spain]] with the 95th Rifles, undertaking the terrible hardships of the rearguard of the [[Battle of Corunna|retreat to Corunna]]. Captain Murray is mortally wounded during the battle, and leaves his heavy cavalry sword to Sharpe, giving him his signature weapon used in all the subsequent books.  Cut off from the main body of the army, he is forced to take command of a handful of surviving but mutinous riflemen (including [[Patrick Harper]]), while protecting a small party of English missionaries and assisting Spanish [[Guerrilla|partisans]] in the temporary liberation of the city of [[Santiago de Compostela]] (''Sharpe's Rifles'').

The rank was unofficial insomuch as it was used only within the company, with commanding officers able to promote and demote at will those who were chosen to wear the single white armband which denoted Chosen Men. They were usually spared ordinary duties, and often went on to become NCOs.\n\nIn the [[Sharpe (TV series)|Sharpe television series]], the rank of Chosen Man is used to denote a special unit within the company, where all the riflemen are Chosen Men.\n\nAfter making their way to Portugal, and taking part in the [[Second Battle of Porto|Battle of the Douro]], Sharpe and his surviving 30 riflemen are attached to the Light Company of the [[South Essex Regiment|South Essex]] (a fictional regiment) as part of Wellesley's [[Peninsular War|Peninsula Army]].

[[List of Sharpe series characters#60th Royal American Rifles|The Royal American 60th Rifles]] under the command of [[Captain William Fredrickson]] were often attached to Sharpe's Company for additional support.\n\nSharpe takes part in a number of notable actions, either with the South Essex, or on detached duty for Major [[Michael Hogan (fictional character)|Michael Hogan]], Wellesley's head of intelligence.  These include the capture of a [[French Imperial Eagle]] at the [[Battle of Talavera]] in 1809, and storming of the breaches at [[Siege of Badajoz (1812)|Badajoz]]. He also takes an active role in the [[Siege of Almeida (1810)|first siege of Almeida]], the [[Battle of Bussaco]], and of [[Battle of Barossa|Barossa]], [[Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo (1812)|Ciudad Rodrigo]], [[Battle of Fuentes de Onoro|Fuentes de Onoro]], [[Battle of Salamanca|Salamanca]], [[Battle of Vitoria|Vitoria]] and [[Battle of Toulouse (1814)|Toulouse]].\n\nOver this period he rises in rank from [[lieutenant]] through [[captain (land)|captain]] to [[major]], eventually taking unofficial command of the entire regiment. In parallel Sharpe's friend and colleague, Harper, rises from rifleman to [[regimental sergeant major]].\n\nHis intelligence work for Hogan and Wellesley brings him the long-lasting enmity of the fictional French [[spymaster]] [[Pierre Ducos]], who conspires several times to destroy Sharpe's career, reputation and life.\n\nSharpe possibly appears in [[Simon Scarrow]]'s ''[[The Fields of Death]]'', although his surname is not confirmed.  A major in the 95th Rifles called Richard and who, \"unusually for an officer... carries a rifle like his men\" delivers captured French orders to the Duke of Wellington indicating the enemy's intention to fall back to Vitoria.\n\nPrior to the [[Battle of Waterloo]], Sharpe is appointed aide to the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and is promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].  Disgusted by the Prince's dangerous incompetence during the course of the battle, Sharpe deserts his post (after making an attempt on the prince's life), but comes to the aid of his old regiment, Prince of Wales Own Volunteers (formerly the South Essex), steadying the line and preventing a French breakthrough. Wellesley then gives him command of the unit for the remainder of the battle (''[[Sharpe's Waterloo]]'').\n\n==Retirement==\nIn 1820 Sharpe, now retired and living as a farmer in [[Normandy]], is commissioned by the Countess of Mouromorto to find her husband, Don Blas Vivar, who has disappeared in the Spanish colony of [[Chile]]; both she and her husband had encountered Sharpe in 1809, during the events leading up to the assault on Santiago de Compostella.\n\nAccompanied by his old companion, Patrick Harper, Sharpe travels to South America, and becomes involved in the [[Chilean War of Independence]] along with [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]]. ''En route'' Sharpe finally meets [[Napoleon]], in exile on [[St Helena]].\n\n==Equipment==\nDuring the earliest (chronological) books Sharpe is a redcoated Private and later Sergeant, and so his uniform and weapons largely are in line with Army regulations.  His first sword and officer's sash are taken from the dead in the wake of the battle of Assaye, although no specifics are given on the weapon.\n\nBy the time of [[Sharpe's Prey]] as a junior Rifle officer, although carrying a regulation curved sabre, Sharpe has begun carrying a [[Baker rifle]] as well, and is noted to prefer a heavier sword like the cutlass used by the Navy.\n\nIn [[Sharpe's Rifles]] Sharpe acquires his signature weapon, a [[1796 Heavy Cavalry Sword]], and clothing for the first time.  Captain Murray, mortally wounded in the Corunna retreat, leaves his Heavy Cavalry sword to Sharpe who had broken his own sword in the battle.  In the final battle of the novel Harper kills a French Chasseur, and Sharpe takes his overalls and boots which he wears with his Rifleman's green jacket from then on.  As Sharpe, like the majority of his men, also carries a French ox-hide pack more of his equipment is French than British.  Sharpe continues to wear his green jacket even whilst serving in a redcoat battalion out of pride in the elite regiment, as do Harper and all of the other riflemen.\n\nSharpe's sword is once again broken in the novel of the same name, and Sharpe gravely wounded with all of his equipment lost.  A new Heavy Cavalry sword is acquired by Harper and refurbished and sharpened by him as a gift to Sharpe to aid in his recovery.  Even after defeating Colonel Leroux and taking his sword, Sharpe continues to use the sword made for him by Harper, and also takes Leroux's overalls and boots to replace his old pair.\n\nSharpe also possesses a telescope from the time he is made an officer.  His first was a gift from Wellington after the Battle of Assaye and is inscribed \"In Gratitude, AW.  September 23rd 1803.\"  It is destroyed by Pierre Ducos in [[Sharpe's Honour]] and he is gifted another that belonged to Joseph Bonaparte, which he carries for the remainder of the series.\n\n==Relationships and family==\nSharpe, the son of a prostitute, has almost no memory of his mother, and no knowledge of his father. The author, Bernard Cornwell, in answer to a query on his website, wrote a riddle which he claims contains the father's identity: \"Take you out, put me in and a horse appears in this happy person!\".  Bernard announced on 27 Jul 18, on his website that Sharpe's father was a French Smuggler and that is all he knows!\n\nSharpe is both a romantic and a womanizer; In ''Sharpe's Rifles'', Harper notes that \"He'll fall in love with anything in a petticoat. I've seen his type before. Got the sense of a half-witted sheep when it comes to women.\"\n\nIn India Sharpe asks for permission to marry Mary Bickerstaff, who later leaves him (''Sharpe's Tiger''), and has a brief affair with Simone Joubert, who bolts with gems he left with her for safe keeping (''Sharpe's Triumph'', ''Sharpe's Fortress'').\n\nHis relationship with Lady Grace Hale in 1805 has a more lasting impact; the birth of his first child, who dies only a few hours after his mother, leaves Sharpe deeply distressed. Sharpe also conceives a child with Astrid Skovgaard in Copenhagen, but she is murdered by British spymaster Lord Pumphrey (''Sharpe's Trafalgar'', ''Sharpe's Prey'').\n\nDuring the early years of the Peninsula Campaign Sharpe's affections are torn between a Portuguese courtesan, [[Josefina Lacosta]], and the partisan leader [[Teresa Moreno]] (''Sharpe's Eagle'', ''Sharpe's Gold''). Teresa bears Sharpe a daughter, Antonia (''Sharpe's Company''), in 1811, and marries Sharpe in 1812, but is murdered a year later by the renegade Obadiah Hakeswill (''Sharpe's Enemy''). Sharpe leaves his daughter to be raised by Teresa's family, and, as far as is known, never sees her again.\n\nOver the same period Sharpe also conducts affairs with an English [[governess]], Sarah Fry (''Sharpe's Escape''), Caterina Veronica Blazquez, a blackmailing prostitute (''Sharpe's Fury''), and the French spy H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Leroux (''Sharpe's Sword'', ''Sharpe's Honour'').\n\nFor some years Sharpe carried a small portrait of [[Jane Gibbons]], taken from her brother's murdered body (''Sharpe's Eagle''). In 1813, he returns to England to fetch reinforcements, and meets, elopes with, and marries Jane (''Sharpe's Regiment'').  Sharpe remains faithful to his second wife, until she herself proves disloyal; when Sharpe is falsely accused of theft and murder, she embarks on an [[adulterous]] affair with Sharpe's former friend [[Lord John Rossendale]] and steals the fortune Sharpe had accumulated in London. It is while searching for evidence to clear his name that Sharpe meets and falls in love with [[Lucille Castineau (nee Lassan)]], the widow of a French officer killed in Russia (''Sharpe's Revenge'', ''Sharpe's Waterloo'').\n\nAlthough unable to marry while Jane lives, Sharpe settles with Lucille on her family estate in Normandy and raises two children, Patrick-Henri, who becomes a French cavalry officer (and a character in Bernand Cornwell's ''[[The Starbuck Chronicles]]''), and Dominique, who ultimately marries an English [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]].\n\nBy 1861, Patrick-Henri, then a colonel in the Imperial Guard Cavalry observing the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] armies during the [[American Civil War]], mentions that his mother is \"very lonely\", so it may be assumed that Sharpe has died sometime before that date. (The ''Sharpe Companion'' gives Sharpe's year of death as 1860, though this is never stated in any of the books). This is contradicted in the television adaptation ''[[Sharpe's Challenge]]'', set in 1817, in which Sharpe claims that Lucille has already died.\n\n==Promotions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Date\n!

So take it forward!\"\n| ''Sharpe's Waterloo''\n|}\n\n==Historical achievements==\nDespite being a fictional hero, Sharpe is often portrayed as the driving force in a number of pivotal historical events. Cornwell frankly admits to taking license with history, placing Sharpe in the place of another man whose identity is lost to history, or sometimes \"stealing another man's thunder\". Such accomplishments include:\n\n*Disabling a booby trap laid for the British soldiers assaulting [[Battle of Seringapatam|Seringapatam]] (Cornwell points out in the novel's historical note that there never actually was such a booby trap, and the event was based on a British shell that struck a magazine in the city days earlier);\n*Killing the [[Tippoo Sultan]] and looting his corpse (the identity of the soldier who killed the Sultan was never revealed, probably because he did not wish to admit to looting his jewels);\n*Saving [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]]'s life at the [[Battle of Assaye]] (Wellesley was unhorsed and forced to defend himself from [[Maratha Empire|Mahratta]] artillerymen for a few crucial moments; Cornwell notes that if any soldier or officer had saved his life during this fight, he would almost certainly have rewarded him with a promotion);\n*Storming the walls of the inner fortress at [[Gawilghur]] and opening the gates to the besieging forces;\n*Sighting the boats that allowed Wellesley's forces to ambush Marshal [[Nicolas Soult]]'s forces at the [[Second Battle of Porto]];\n*Being the first British soldier to capture an [[French Imperial Eagle|Imperial Eagle]], at the [[Battle of Talavera]] (in reality, the first French Eagle to be captured by the British was at the [[Battle of Barrossa]] in 1811);\n*Successfully assaulting the central breach at [[Battle of Badajoz (1812)|Badajoz]];\n*Deliberately triggering the massive explosion that destroyed the fortress of [[Siege of Almeida (1810)|Almeida]] (usually attributed to accident, combined with careless British handling of their munitions store);\n*Carrying the news of Napoleon's invasion of [[Belgium]] to Wellington at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]], during the [[Waterloo Campaign]] (historically the bearer of the message was one of the Prince of Orange's ADCs: Lieutenant Henry Webster, 9th Light Dragoons);\n* Firing the shot that wounded [[William II of the Netherlands|the Prince of Orange]] during the [[Battle of Waterloo]], forcing him to retire from the field (in reality, this shot was most likely fired by a French skirmisher);\n* Taking command of a regiment driving off the advance of the [[French Imperial Guard]] at the Battle of Waterloo.\n\n==Novels, short stories, and non-fiction==\n\nThe first book was written in 1981, with Richard Sharpe in Spain at the Talavera Campaign in 1809. The next seven books were written in order up to ''Sharpe's Siege'' in 1814. The  novel ''Sharpe's Rifles'' was written next, set earlier in 1809 at the time of the retreat from Corunna, Spain. The next four books follow on from ''Sharpe's Siege'' up to ''Sharpe's Devil'', set in 1820\u201321. Then came ''Sharpe's Battle'' set between ''Sharpe's Gold'' and ''Sharpe's Company'' (set in 1811). Cornwell then moved to the beginning of Sharpe's army career in British India with ''Sharpe's Tiger'' set in 1799, beginning a series of three books, closing with ''Sharpe's Prey'' set in 1807. Cornwell followed this with two novels and four short stories which lie between ''Sharpe's Rifles'' (1809) and ''Sharpe's Devil'' (1820\u201321).\n\nCornwell published the non-fiction book ''[[Waterloo: The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles]]'' in September 2014, timely for the 200th anniversary of the [[Battle of Waterloo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/c/bernard-cornwell/battle-of-waterloo.htm |title=Waterloo: The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles |author=Bernard Cornwell |publisher=Fantastic Fiction |accessdate=9 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709030237/http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/c/bernard-cornwell/battle-of-waterloo.htm |archivedate=9 July 2014 }}</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The stories formed the basis for [[Sharpe (TV series)|an ITV television series]] featuring [[Sean Bean]] in the title role.\n\nCornwell's series is composed of several novels and short stories, and charts Sharpe's progress in the [[British Army]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He begins in ''[[Sharpe's Tiger]]'' as a [[private (rank)|private]] in the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|33rd Regiment of Foot]] who becomes a sergeant by the end of the book; he is an ensign in the [[74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot|74th Regiment]] during ''[[Sharpe's Trafalgar]]'' who is transferred to the newly formed [[95th Rifles]] as a second lieutenant. He is gradually promoted through the ranks, finally becoming a [[lieutenant colonel]] in ''[[Sharpe's Waterloo]]''.\n\nThe character of Sharpe is born a guttersnipe in the [[Rookery (slum)|rookeries]] of London, and the stories dramatize his struggle for acceptance and respect from his fellow officers and from the men whom he commands. He is commissioned an officer on the battlefield and has to fight class prejudice in an army where an officer's rank is often [[Sale of commissions|bought]]. He is an experienced soldier, unlike many of the officers with whom he serves. His adventures result in his improbable presence at nearly every important event in the British Empire at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries.\n\nSharpe is described as \"brilliant but wayward\" in ''[[Sharpe's Sword]]'', and he is portrayed by the author as a \"loose cannon\". He is a highly skilled leader of light troops who takes part in a range of historical events during the Napoleonic Wars and other conflicts, including the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. He is considered dangerous to have as an enemy; he is a skilled marksman and grows to be a good swordsman. The books were published in non-chronological order, but in most of them he is a rifle officer armed with a [[1796 Heavy Cavalry Sword]] and a [[Baker rifle]], although he has also acquired a pistol by ''[[Sharpe's Waterloo]]''. He is described as being six feet tall with an angular, tanned face, long black hair, and blue eyes. His most obvious physical characteristic is a deep scar on his right cheek which pulls at his right eye, giving his face a mocking expression when relaxed; this disappears when he smiles, which is not too frequently. By the end of the series, he has had two wives and three children.\n\n==Early years==\nRichard Sharpe was born in [[London]] circa 26 June 1777 (he believes that he may be 22 during the early months of 1799) to a prostitute residing in \"Cat Lane\", and a French smuggler. When Sharpe is three, his mother is killed in the [[Gordon Riots]], leaving him an orphan.\n\nWith no other known relatives to claim him, Sharpe is deposited in Jem Hocking's foundling home at Brewhouse Lane, [[Wapping]], where he spends his days picking his assigned quota of [[oakum]]. He is malnourished and regularly beaten, resulting in his being undersized for his age. Because of this, he is eventually sold to a master [[chimney sweep]] to train as an apprentice at the relatively late age of 12. Fearing the high mortality rate among apprentice sweeps (who are forced to climb inside chimneys and remove the soot by hand), Sharpe flees to the [[Rookery (slum)|Rookery]] of [[St Giles, London|St Giles]] (a form of slum), and is taken in by prostitute (and later bar-owner) Maggie Joyce. He stays under Maggie's protection for three years, learning various forms of thieving.\n\nAfter killing a gang leader during a fight over Maggie, he escapes from [[London]] to [[Yorkshire]] at the age of fifteen (by creating this back story, [[Bernard Cornwell]] made the actor Sean Bean's Yorkshire accent part of the [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] of the series). It is possible that Sharpe learned to play cricket in Yorkshire, as in ''[[Sharpe's Waterloo]]'' the Duke of Wellington attests that \"Sharpe bowls fiendish\". He also played while training with the Rifles at [[Shorncliffe Redoubt]] (''[[Sharpe's Fury]])''.\n\nWithin six months of his arrival in Yorkshire, Sharpe kills a second man, the landlord of the tavern where he is working, in a fight over a local girl.\n\nTo avoid arrest, Sharpe takes the \"[[King's shilling]]\", joining the [[33rd Regiment of Foot|33rd Foot]], as a result of the blandishments of [[recruiting sergeant]] [[Obadiah Hakeswill]]. The regiment (popularly known as \"The Havercakes\", due to the [[oatcake]] the recruiting sergeants display on their bayonets to attract hungry potential recruits) is first sent to [[Flanders]] in 1794, where Sharpe fights in his first battle, at [[Battle of Boxtel|Boxtel]]. The next year, he and his regiment are posted to [[India]] under the command of the [[British East India Company]].\n\n==India==\nIn 1799, Sharpe is sentenced to 2,000 lashes (effectively a death sentence) for striking a sergeant, with the connivance of his company commander, [[List of Sharpe series characters#Charles Morris|Captain Charles Morris]], but is released after only 200 by executive order (''[[Sharpe's Tiger]]''). He is assigned to accompany Lieutenant [[William Lawford]] on a secret mission to rescue Lawford's uncle, head of [[British East India Company]] intelligence, Colonel Hector McCandless. They join the [[Tippoo Sultan]]'s army, posing as British deserters, but are later exposed and imprisoned. Lawford teaches Sharpe to read and write while they languish in the Tippoo's dungeon. Sharpe escapes during the [[Siege of Seringapatam (1799)|Siege of Seringapatam]] and destroys a mine meant to devastate the British army. He then kills the Tippoo Sultan unobserved and steals a fortune of jewels from the corpse. He is promoted to [[sergeant]] for his efforts.\n\nSharpe serves four uneventful years as a sergeant. In 1803, he is the sole survivor of a massacre of the garrison of a small fort carried out by a [[turncoat]] Company officer, [[William Dodd (fiction)|William Dodd]] (''[[Sharpe's Triumph]]''). As a result, he is taken by McCandless on a mission to identify and capture Dodd. Their search takes them first to the siege of [[Ahmednuggur]] and then the [[Battle of Assaye]]. At Assaye, the greatly outnumbered British force is commanded by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] (the future Duke of Wellington). When Wellesley's orderly is killed in the early stages of the battle, Sharpe takes his place, and so is at hand when Wellesley is unhorsed alone and among the enemy.  Sharpe single-handedly saves the general's life, killing numerous soldiers and holding the rest at bay until help finally arrives. He is rewarded with a [[battlefield commission]] for this act of bravery and joins the [[74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot|74th Regiment]] as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]].\n\nBoth Sharpe and his new colleagues find it difficult to adjust to Sharpe's new status and role, and his superiors in the 74th arrange for him to be transferred to the newly formed [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|95th Rifles Regiment]]. Before leaving India, he takes part in the assault on [[Gawilghur]], commanding troops in action for the first time. Once inside the fortress, Sharpe finally confronts Dodd and kills him, receiving a scar on his right cheek (''[[Sharpe's Fortress]]'').\n\n==Campaigns in Europe==\nWhile travelling from India to England to take up his post in the 95th Rifles, in 1805, Sharpe is caught up in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], his first direct encounter with [[France]] and its European allies as an Infantry officer. On the journey he also meets and falls in love with Lady Grace Hale, the wife of a politician (''[[Sharpe's Trafalgar]]'').\n\nGrace sets up home with Sharpe at [[Shorncliffe, Kent|Shorncliffe]], but dies giving birth to their child, who survives her by only a few hours. Sharpe's fortune is assumed by the lawyers to be part of Grace's estate and seized.  Sharpe falls into a deep depression, worsened by conflict with other officers in the Rifles, who relegate him to the role of [[quartermaster]], and leave him behind when the regiment is posted to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] in 1807. Sharpe, unable to sell his commission, plans to desert.  He returns to [[Wapping]] to rob and kill Jem Hocking, the abusive master of the foundling home where Sharpe was raised. Before Sharpe can disappear with the stolen cash, he encounters [[Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet|General Baird]], a former colleague from India, who recruits him to protect John Lavisser, a Foreign Office agent sent to negotiate with the Danish [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Crown Prince]]. Lavisser betrays Sharpe, and forces him into hiding in [[Copenhagen]], where he witnesses the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|bombardment of the city]] and the British capture of the [[Denmark|Danish]] fleet (''[[Sharpe's Prey]]''). In ''Sharpe's Prey'', Sharpe is now referred to as a second lieutenant because, as a light infantry unit of the British army, there are no [[Colours, standards and guidons|Colours]] and thus no ensigns in the Rifles.\n\n[[File:2 95th riflemen in various fighting stances.JPG|thumb|200px|95th Rifles [[Historical reenactment|reenactors]].]]\n\nIn ''[[Sharpe's Rifles]]'', Sharpe is said to have fought against the French in Portugal at [[Battle of Roli\u00e7a|Roli\u00e7a]] and [[Battle of Vimeiro|Vimeiro]], both in August 1808. Sharpe is now a lieutenant in the 95th Rifles, having been promoted, most likely thanks to seniority. This view is further supported by the promotion of Warren Dunnett. In ''Sharpe's Prey'', Dunnett is a captain, while in ''Sharpe's Rifles'', Dunnett is a major. This means that the old major of the Second Battalion in the 95th Rifles died in 1807. Dunnett, being the senior captain, took his place. The senior lieutenant in the battalion became a captain and Sharpe, as the senior second lieutenant, became a lieutenant. The promotion takes place after ''Sharpe's Prey'', but before ''Sharpe's Rifles''.\n\nBy early 1809, Sharpe is in [[Spain]] with the 95th Rifles, undertaking the terrible hardships of the rearguard of the [[Battle of Corunna|retreat to Corunna]]. Captain Murray is mortally wounded during the battle, and leaves his heavy cavalry sword to Sharpe, giving him his signature weapon used in all the subsequent books.  Cut off from the main body of the army, he is forced to take command of a handful of surviving but mutinous riflemen (including [[Patrick Harper]]), while protecting a small party of English missionaries and assisting Spanish [[Guerrilla|partisans]] in the temporary liberation of the city of [[Santiago de Compostela]] (''Sharpe's Rifles'').

Chosen Men were the Napoleonic era's equivalent of today's lance corporal.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Whilst one step below non-commissioned officer (NCO), the Chosen Man was selected from the ranks to lead a sub-unit of a company, often for their intelligence and ability. The rank was unofficial insomuch as it was used only within the company, with commanding officers able to promote and demote at will those who were chosen to wear the single white armband which denoted Chosen Men. They were usually spared ordinary duties, and often went on to become NCOs.\n\nIn the [[Sharpe (TV series)|Sharpe television series]], the rank of Chosen Man is used to denote a special unit within the company, where all the riflemen are Chosen Men.\n\nAfter making their way to Portugal, and taking part in the [[Second Battle of Porto|Battle of the Douro]], Sharpe and his surviving 30 riflemen are attached to the Light Company of the [[South Essex Regiment|South Essex]] (a fictional regiment) as part of Wellesley's [[Peninsular War|Peninsula Army]].

[[List of Sharpe series characters#60th Royal American Rifles|The Royal American 60th Rifles]] under the command of [[Captain William Fredrickson]] were often attached to Sharpe's Company for additional support.\n\nSharpe takes part in a number of notable actions, either with the South Essex, or on detached duty for Major [[Michael Hogan (fictional character)|Michael Hogan]], Wellesley's head of intelligence.  These include the capture of a [[French Imperial Eagle]] at the [[Battle of Talavera]] in 1809, and storming of the breaches at [[Siege of Badajoz (1812)|Badajoz]]. He also takes an active role in the [[Siege of Almeida (1810)|first siege of Almeida]], the [[Battle of Bussaco]], and of [[Battle of Barossa|Barossa]], [[Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo (1812)|Ciudad Rodrigo]], [[Battle of Fuentes de Onoro|Fuentes de Onoro]], [[Battle of Salamanca|Salamanca]], [[Battle of Vitoria|Vitoria]] and [[Battle of Toulouse (1814)|Toulouse]].\n\nOver this period he rises in rank from [[lieutenant]] through [[captain (land)|captain]] to [[major]], eventually taking unofficial command of the entire regiment. In parallel Sharpe's friend and colleague, Harper, rises from rifleman to [[regimental sergeant major]].\n\nHis intelligence work for Hogan and Wellesley brings him the long-lasting enmity of the fictional French [[spymaster]] [[Pierre Ducos]], who conspires several times to destroy Sharpe's career, reputation and life.\n\nSharpe possibly appears in [[Simon Scarrow]]'s ''[[The Fields of Death]]'', although his surname is not confirmed.  A major in the 95th Rifles called Richard and who, \"unusually for an officer... carries a rifle like his men\" delivers captured French orders to the Duke of Wellington indicating the enemy's intention to fall back to Vitoria.\n\nPrior to the [[Battle of Waterloo]], Sharpe is appointed aide to the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and is promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].  Disgusted by the Prince's dangerous incompetence during the course of the battle, Sharpe deserts his post (after making an attempt on the prince's life), but comes to the aid of his old regiment, Prince of Wales Own Volunteers (formerly the South Essex), steadying the line and preventing a French breakthrough. Wellesley then gives him command of the unit for the remainder of the battle (''[[Sharpe's Waterloo]]'').\n\n==Retirement==\nIn 1820 Sharpe, now retired and living as a farmer in [[Normandy]], is commissioned by the Countess of Mouromorto to find her husband, Don Blas Vivar, who has disappeared in the Spanish colony of [[Chile]]; both she and her husband had encountered Sharpe in 1809, during the events leading up to the assault on Santiago de Compostella.\n\nAccompanied by his old companion, Patrick Harper, Sharpe travels to South America, and becomes involved in the [[Chilean War of Independence]] along with [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]]. ''En route'' Sharpe finally meets [[Napoleon]], in exile on [[St Helena]].\n\n==Equipment==\nDuring the earliest (chronological) books Sharpe is a redcoated Private and later Sergeant, and so his uniform and weapons largely are in line with Army regulations.  His first sword and officer's sash are taken from the dead in the wake of the battle of Assaye, although no specifics are given on the weapon.\n\nBy the time of [[Sharpe's Prey]] as a junior Rifle officer, although carrying a regulation curved sabre, Sharpe has begun carrying a [[Baker rifle]] as well, and is noted to prefer a heavier sword like the cutlass used by the Navy.\n\nIn [[Sharpe's Rifles]] Sharpe acquires his signature weapon, a [[1796 Heavy Cavalry Sword]], and clothing for the first time.  Captain Murray, mortally wounded in the Corunna retreat, leaves his Heavy Cavalry sword to Sharpe who had broken his own sword in the battle.  In the final battle of the novel Harper kills a French Chasseur, and Sharpe takes his overalls and boots which he wears with his Rifleman's green jacket from then on.  As Sharpe, like the majority of his men, also carries a French ox-hide pack more of his equipment is French than British.  Sharpe continues to wear his green jacket even whilst serving in a redcoat battalion out of pride in the elite regiment, as do Harper and all of the other riflemen.\n\nSharpe's sword is once again broken in the novel of the same name, and Sharpe gravely wounded with all of his equipment lost.  A new Heavy Cavalry sword is acquired by Harper and refurbished and sharpened by him as a gift to Sharpe to aid in his recovery.  Even after defeating Colonel Leroux and taking his sword, Sharpe continues to use the sword made for him by Harper, and also takes Leroux's overalls and boots to replace his old pair.\n\nSharpe also possesses a telescope from the time he is made an officer.  His first was a gift from Wellington after the Battle of Assaye and is inscribed \"In Gratitude, AW.  September 23rd 1803.\"  It is destroyed by Pierre Ducos in [[Sharpe's Honour]] and he is gifted another that belonged to Joseph Bonaparte, which he carries for the remainder of the series.\n\n==Relationships and family==\nSharpe, the son of a prostitute, has almost no memory of his mother, and no knowledge of his father. The author, Bernard Cornwell, in answer to a query on his website, wrote a riddle which he claims contains the father's identity: \"Take you out, put me in and a horse appears in this happy person!\".  Bernard announced on 27 Jul 18, on his website that Sharpe's father was a French Smuggler and that is all he knows!\n\nSharpe is both a romantic and a womanizer; In ''Sharpe's Rifles'', Harper notes that \"He'll fall in love with anything in a petticoat. I've seen his type before. Got the sense of a half-witted sheep when it comes to women.\"\n\nIn India Sharpe asks for permission to marry Mary Bickerstaff, who later leaves him (''Sharpe's Tiger''), and has a brief affair with Simone Joubert, who bolts with gems he left with her for safe keeping (''Sharpe's Triumph'', ''Sharpe's Fortress'').\n\nHis relationship with Lady Grace Hale in 1805 has a more lasting impact; the birth of his first child, who dies only a few hours after his mother, leaves Sharpe deeply distressed. Sharpe also conceives a child with Astrid Skovgaard in Copenhagen, but she is murdered by British spymaster Lord Pumphrey (''Sharpe's Trafalgar'', ''Sharpe's Prey'').\n\nDuring the early years of the Peninsula Campaign Sharpe's affections are torn between a Portuguese courtesan, [[Josefina Lacosta]], and the partisan leader [[Teresa Moreno]] (''Sharpe's Eagle'', ''Sharpe's Gold''). Teresa bears Sharpe a daughter, Antonia (''Sharpe's Company''), in 1811, and marries Sharpe in 1812, but is murdered a year later by the renegade Obadiah Hakeswill (''Sharpe's Enemy''). Sharpe leaves his daughter to be raised by Teresa's family, and, as far as is known, never sees her again.\n\nOver the same period Sharpe also conducts affairs with an English [[governess]], Sarah Fry (''Sharpe's Escape''), Caterina Veronica Blazquez, a blackmailing prostitute (''Sharpe's Fury''), and the French spy H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Leroux (''Sharpe's Sword'', ''Sharpe's Honour'').\n\nFor some years Sharpe carried a small portrait of [[Jane Gibbons]], taken from her brother's murdered body (''Sharpe's Eagle''). In 1813, he returns to England to fetch reinforcements, and meets, elopes with, and marries Jane (''Sharpe's Regiment'').  Sharpe remains faithful to his second wife, until she herself proves disloyal; when Sharpe is falsely accused of theft and murder, she embarks on an [[adulterous]] affair with Sharpe's former friend [[Lord John Rossendale]] and steals the fortune Sharpe had accumulated in London. It is while searching for evidence to clear his name that Sharpe meets and falls in love with [[Lucille Castineau (nee Lassan)]], the widow of a French officer killed in Russia (''Sharpe's Revenge'', ''Sharpe's Waterloo'').\n\nAlthough unable to marry while Jane lives, Sharpe settles with Lucille on her family estate in Normandy and raises two children, Patrick-Henri, who becomes a French cavalry officer (and a character in Bernand Cornwell's ''[[The Starbuck Chronicles]]''), and Dominique, who ultimately marries an English [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]].\n\nBy 1861, Patrick-Henri, then a colonel in the Imperial Guard Cavalry observing the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] armies during the [[American Civil War]], mentions that his mother is \"very lonely\", so it may be assumed that Sharpe has died sometime before that date. (The ''Sharpe Companion'' gives Sharpe's year of death as 1860, though this is never stated in any of the books). This is contradicted in the television adaptation ''[[Sharpe's Challenge]]'', set in 1817, in which Sharpe claims that Lucille has already died.\n\n==Promotions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Date\n!

So take it forward!\"\n| ''Sharpe's Waterloo''\n|}\n\n==Historical achievements==\nDespite being a fictional hero, Sharpe is often portrayed as the driving force in a number of pivotal historical events. Cornwell frankly admits to taking license with history, placing Sharpe in the place of another man whose identity is lost to history, or sometimes \"stealing another man's thunder\". Such accomplishments include:\n\n*Disabling a booby trap laid for the British soldiers assaulting [[Battle of Seringapatam|Seringapatam]] (Cornwell points out in the novel's historical note that there never actually was such a booby trap, and the event was based on a British shell that struck a magazine in the city days earlier);\n*Killing the [[Tippoo Sultan]] and looting his corpse (the identity of the soldier who killed the Sultan was never revealed, probably because he did not wish to admit to looting his jewels);\n*Saving [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]]'s life at the [[Battle of Assaye]] (Wellesley was unhorsed and forced to defend himself from [[Maratha Empire|Mahratta]] artillerymen for a few crucial moments; Cornwell notes that if any soldier or officer had saved his life during this fight, he would almost certainly have rewarded him with a promotion);\n*Storming the walls of the inner fortress at [[Gawilghur]] and opening the gates to the besieging forces;\n*Sighting the boats that allowed Wellesley's forces to ambush Marshal [[Nicolas Soult]]'s forces at the [[Second Battle of Porto]];\n*Being the first British soldier to capture an [[French Imperial Eagle|Imperial Eagle]], at the [[Battle of Talavera]] (in reality, the first French Eagle to be captured by the British was at the [[Battle of Barrossa]] in 1811);\n*Successfully assaulting the central breach at [[Battle of Badajoz (1812)|Badajoz]];\n*Deliberately triggering the massive explosion that destroyed the fortress of [[Siege of Almeida (1810)|Almeida]] (usually attributed to accident, combined with careless British handling of their munitions store);\n*Carrying the news of Napoleon's invasion of [[Belgium]] to Wellington at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]], during the [[Waterloo Campaign]] (historically the bearer of the message was one of the Prince of Orange's ADCs: Lieutenant Henry Webster, 9th Light Dragoons);\n* Firing the shot that wounded [[William II of the Netherlands|the Prince of Orange]] during the [[Battle of Waterloo]], forcing him to retire from the field (in reality, this shot was most likely fired by a French skirmisher);\n* Taking command of a regiment driving off the advance of the [[French Imperial Guard]] at the Battle of Waterloo.\n\n==Novels, short stories, and non-fiction==\n\nThe first book was written in 1981, with Richard Sharpe in Spain at the Talavera Campaign in 1809. The next seven books were written in order up to ''Sharpe's Siege'' in 1814. The  novel ''Sharpe's Rifles'' was written next, set earlier in 1809 at the time of the retreat from Corunna, Spain. The next four books follow on from ''Sharpe's Siege'' up to ''Sharpe's Devil'', set in 1820\u201321. Then came ''Sharpe's Battle'' set between ''Sharpe's Gold'' and ''Sharpe's Company'' (set in 1811). Cornwell then moved to the beginning of Sharpe's army career in British India with ''Sharpe's Tiger'' set in 1799, beginning a series of three books, closing with ''Sharpe's Prey'' set in 1807. Cornwell followed this with two novels and four short stories which lie between ''Sharpe's Rifles'' (1809) and ''Sharpe's Devil'' (1820\u201321).\n\nCornwell published the non-fiction book ''[[Waterloo: The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles]]'' in September 2014, timely for the 200th anniversary of the [[Battle of Waterloo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/c/bernard-cornwell/battle-of-waterloo.htm |title=Waterloo: The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles |author=Bernard Cornwell |publisher=Fantastic Fiction |accessdate=9 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709030237/http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/c/bernard-cornwell/battle-of-waterloo.htm |archivedate=9 July 2014 }}</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
