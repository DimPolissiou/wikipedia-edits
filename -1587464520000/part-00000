Almost immediately after his death in 323 BC a body of legend began to accumulate about his exploits and life which, over the centuries, became increasingly fantastic as well as allegorical. Collectively this tradition is called the ''Alexander romance'' and some [[recension]]s feature such vivid episodes as Alexander ascending through the air to [[Paradise]], journeying to the bottom of the sea in a glass bubble, and journeying through the [[Land of Darkness]] in search of the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] (Fountain of Youth).\n\nThe earliest [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts of the ''Alexander romance'', as they have survived, indicate that it was composed at [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century. The original text was lost but was the source of some eighty different versions written in twenty-four different languages.<ref>[[#McGinn1998|McGinn 1998]].</ref>  As the ''Alexander romance'' persisted in popularity over the centuries, it was assumed by various neighbouring people. Of particular significance was its incorporation into Jewish and later Christian legendary traditions. In the Jewish tradition Alexander was initially a figure of [[satire]], representing the vain or covetous ruler who is ignorant of larger spiritual truths. Yet their belief in a just, all-powerful God forced Jewish interpreters of the Alexander tradition to come to terms with Alexander's undeniable temporal success. Why would a just, all-powerful God show such favour to an unrighteous ruler? This [[Problem of evil|theological need]], plus acculturation to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], led to a more positive Jewish interpretation of the Alexander legacy. In its most neutral form this was typified by having Alexander show deference to either the Jewish people or the symbols of their faith. In having the great conqueror thus acknowledge the essential truth of the Jews' religious, intellectual, or ethical traditions, the prestige of Alexander was harnessed to the cause of Jewish [[ethnocentrism]]. Eventually Jewish writers would almost completely co-opt Alexander, depicting him as a [[Righteous among the Nations|righteous gentile]] or even a believing monotheist.<ref>[[#Jewish Encyclopedia|Broyd\u00e9 1906]].</ref>\n\nThe Christianized peoples of the [[Near East]], inheritors of both the Hellenic as well as Judaic strands of the ''Alexander romance'', further theologized Alexander until in some stories he was depicted as a [[saint]]. The Christian legends turned the ancient Greek conqueror Alexander III into Alexander ''\"the Believing King\"'', implying that he was a believer in monotheism. Eventually elements of the ''Alexander romance'' were combined with [[Biblical]] legends such as [[Gog and Magog]].\n\nDuring the period of history during which the ''Alexander romance'' was written, little was known about the true [[historical Alexander the Great]] as most of the history of his conquests had been preserved in the form of folklore and legends.

Several Syriac manuscripts of the ''[[Alexander romance]]'' exist, dating from the 7th century. The [[:Category:Greek\u2013Syriac translators|Greek\u2013Syriac translators]] are generally credited with introducing the works of the ancient Greeks to pre-[[Islamic]] [[Arabia]].]]\nThe legendary Alexander material originated as early as the time of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] (305 BC to 30 BC)  and its unknown authors are sometimes referred to as the ''[[Pseudo-Callisthenes]]'' (not to be confused with [[Callisthenes of Olynthus]], who was Alexander's official historian). The earliest surviving manuscript of the ''Alexander romance'', called the \u03b1 ([[alpha]]) [[recension]], can be dated to the 3rd century AD and was written in [[Greek language|Greek]] in [[Alexandria]]:\n\n<blockquote>There have been many theories regarding the date and sources of this curious work [the ''Alexander romance'']. According to the most recent authority, ... it was compiled by a Greco-Egyptian writing in Alexandria about A.D. 300. The sources on which the anonymous author drew were twofold. On the one hand he made use of a `romanticized history of Alexander of a highly rhetorical type depending on the [[Cleitarchus]] tradition, and with this he amalgamated a collection of imaginary letters derived from an ''Epistolary Romance of Alexander'' written in the first century B.C. He also included two long letters from Alexander to his mother [[Olympias]] and his tutor [[Aristotle]]  describing his marvellous adventures in India and at the end of the World. These are the literary expression of a living popular tradition and as such are the most remarkable and interesting part of the work.<ref name=Brock1970/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Greek language|Greek]] variants of the ''Alexander romance'' continued to evolve until, in the 4th century, the Greek legend was translated into [[Latin]] by [[Julius Valerius Alexander Polemius]] (where it is called the ''[[Res gestae Alexandri Magni]]'') and from Latin it spread to all major [[vernacular]] languages of [[Europe]] in the Middle Ages. Around the same as its translation into Latin, the Greek text was also translated into the [[Syriac language]] and from Syriac it spread to eastern cultures and languages as far afield as China and Southeast Asia.<ref>HANAWAY, WILLIAM L.

The Syriac legend, as it has survived, consists of five distinct manuscripts, including a [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] religious legend concerning Alexander and a sermon about Alexander ascribed to the Syriac poet-theologian [[Jacob of Serugh]] (451\u2013521 AD, also called Mar Jacob), which according to Reinink was composed around 629\u2013636.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Reign of Heraclius: Crisis & Confrontation|last=Reinink |display-authors=etal |publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=35|quote=A syriac metrical homily ascribed to Jacob of Serug, the so called Alexanderlied, was composed between 629 - 636}}</ref> The Syriac Christian legend concentrates on Alexander's journey to the end of the World, where he constructs the ''[[Gates of Alexander]]'' to enclose the evil nations of ''[[Gog and Magog]]'', while the sermon describes his journey to the ''[[Land of Darkness]]'' to discover the ''[[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]'' (Fountain of Youth). These legends concerning Alexander are remarkably similar to the story of Dhul-Qarnayn found in the Quran.<ref name=stoneman2003>[[#Stoneman2003|Stoneman 2003]].</ref>\n\nOne of the five Syriac manuscripts, dated to the 18th century, has a version of the Syriac legend that has been  generally dated to between 629 AD and 636 AD. There is evidence in the legend of  \"''[[ex eventu]]'' knowledge of the [[Khazar]] invasion of [[Armenia]] in A.D. 629,\"<ref>[[#Czegledy1954|Czegl\u00e9dy 1954]].</ref><ref>[[#Czegledy1957|Czegl\u00e9dy 1957]].</ref> which suggests that the legend must have been burdened with additions by a [[redaction|redactor]] sometime around 629 AD.  The legend   appears to have been composed as [[propaganda]] in support of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (575\u2013641 AD) shortly after he defeated the Persians in the [[Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602\u2013628]]. It is notable that this manuscript fails to mention the Islamic conquest of [[Jerusalem]] in 636 AD by [[Muhammad]]'s (570\u2013632 AD) successor, [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] (590\u2013644 AD). This fact means that the legend might have been recorded before the \"cataclysmic event\"` that was the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]] and the resulting [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|surrender of Jerusalem]] in November 636 AD. That the [[Byzantine\u2013Arab Wars]] would have been referenced in the legend, had it been written after 636 AD, is supported by the fact that in 692 AD a Syriac Christian adaption of the ''Alexander romance'' called the ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'' was indeed written as a response to the Muslim invasions and was [[pseudepigraphy|falsely attributed]] to [[Methodius of Olympus|St Methodius]] (?\u2013311 AD); this ''Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius'' equated the evil nations of ''Gog and Magog'' with the Muslim invaders and shaped the [[eschatology|eschatological]] imagination of [[Christendom]] for centuries.<ref name=stoneman2003/>\n\nThe manuscripts also contain evidence of lost texts. For example, there is some evidence of a lost pre-Islamic [[Arabic]] version of the translation that is thought to have been an intermediary between the Syriac Christian and the [[Ethiopic]] Christian translations.<ref>[[#Doufikar2003|Doufikar-Aerts 2003]].</ref> There is also evidence that the Syriac translation was not directly based on the Greek recensions but was based on a lost [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] (pre-Islamic Persian) intermediary.<ref name=Brock1970>[[#Brock1970|Brock 1970]].</ref>\n\nOne scholar (Kevin van Bladel)<ref name=KvBALitQ2008:175-203>[[#KvBALitQ2008|van Bladel, \"Alexander Legend in the Qur'an \", 2008]]: p.175-203</ref> who finds striking similarities between the Quranic verses 18:83-102 and the Syriac legend in support of Emperor [[Heraclius]], dates the work to 629-630 AD or before Muhammad's death, not 629-636 AD.<ref name=KvBALitQ2008:178-79/> The Syriac legend matches many details in the five parts of the verses (Alexander being the two horned one, journey to edge of the world, punishment of evil doers, Gog and Magog, etc.) and also \"makes some sense of the cryptic Qur'anic story\" being 21 pages (in one edition)<ref name=KvBALitQ2008:178-79>[[#KvBALitQ2008|van Bladel, \"Alexander Legend in the Qur'an \", 2008]]: p.178-79</ref> not 20 verses.

In the prophecy, [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] has a vision of a ram with two long horns and verse 20 explains that ''\"The ram which thou sawest having two horns is the kings of [[Medes|Media]] and [[Persia]].\"'':\n\n<blockquote>[[Josephus]] [37\u2013100 AD], in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' xi, 8, 5 tells of a visit that Alexander is purported to have made to [[Jerusalem]], where he met the high priest Jaddua and the assembled Jews, and was shown the book of Daniel in which it was prophesied that some one of the Greeks would overthrow the empire of Persia. Alexander believed himself to be the one indicated, and was pleased. The pertinent passage in Daniel would seem to be VIII. 3\u20138 which tells of the overthrow of the two-horned ram by the one-horned goat, the one horn of the goat being broken in the encounter ...The interpretation of this is given further ...  \"The ram which thou sawest that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.

And Alexander said unto him, ' ''Thou didst call me by the name Two-horned,'' but my name is Alexander ... and I thought that thou hadst cursed me by calling me by this name.'

They represent him as a god, as a son of a god, as a prophet and propagandist of the Most High, as something approaching the role of a messiah, and also as the champion of Allah. They represent him as a world conqueror, who subjugated the two horns or ends of the world, the lands of the rising and of the setting sun ...<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\"/></blockquote>\n\nFor these reasons, among others, the Quran's Arabic epithet \"Dhul-Qarnayn,\" literally meaning \"the two-horned one,\" is interpreted as a reference to Alexander the Great.\n\n===Alexander's Wall===\n[[File:Iranischer Meister 001.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Iranian art|Persian]] painting from the 16th century illustrating the building of the wall with the help of the [[jinn]]]]\n\n====Early accounts of Alexander's Wall====\nThe  building of gates in the [[Caucasus Mountains]] by Alexander to repel the barbarian peoples identified with Gog and Magog has ancient provenance and the wall is  known as the [[Gates of Alexander]] or the [[Caspian Gates]]. The name Caspian Gates originally applied to the narrow region at the southeast corner of the [[Caspian Sea]], through which Alexander actually marched in the pursuit of [[Bessus]] in 329 BC, although he did not stop to fortify it. It was transferred to the passes through the Caucasus, on the other side of the Caspian, by the more fanciful historians of Alexander. The Jewish historian [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] (37\u2013100 AD) mentions that:\n\n<blockquote>...a nation of the Alans, whom we have previously mentioned elsewhere as being [[Scythians]] ... travelled through a passage which King Alexander [the Great] shut up with iron gates.<ref>''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'', VII, vii, Flavius Josephus</ref></blockquote>\n\nJosephus also records that the people of Magog, the Magogites, were synonymous with the Scythians.<ref>''[[The Antiquities of the Jews]]'', I, vi, Flavius Josephus</ref> According to Andrew Runni Anderson,<ref>[[#Anderson1932|Anderson 1932]].</ref> this merely indicates that the main elements of the story were already in place six centuries before the Quran's revelation, not that the story itself was known in the cohesive form apparent in the Quranic account. Similarly, [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] (347\u2013420 AD), in his ''Letter 77'', mentions that,\n\n<blockquote>The hordes of the Huns had poured forth all the way from [[Sea of Azov|Maeotis]] (they had their haunts between the icy [[Tanais]] and the rude [[Massagetae]], ''where the [[gates of Alexander]] keep back the wild peoples behind the Caucasus'').<ref>Letter 77 \"To Oceanus\", 8, Saint Jerome</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his Commentary on [[Ezekiel]] (38:2), Jerome identifies the nations located beyond the [[Caucasus mountains]] and near [[Sea of Azov|Lake Maeotis]] as Gog and Magog.  Thus the [[Gates of Alexander]] legend  was combined with the legend of [[Gog and Magog]] from the [[Book of Revelation]]. It has been suggested that the incorporation of the Gog and Magog legend into the ''Alexander romance'' was prompted by the [[Hunnic Empire#Early campaigns|invasion of the Huns]] across the [[Caucasus]] mountains in 395 AD into [[Armenia]] and [[Syria]].<ref>''Gog and Magog : Ezekiel 38-39 as pre-text for Revelation 19,17 and 20,7\u201310'', Sverre B\u00f8e, Mohr Siebec, 2001 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=vettpBoVOX4C&pg=PA223&lpg=PA223&dq=huns+caucasus+barrier+395&source=bl&ots=OzcMrWCevB&sig=YF72Rf6ypxYmGIySA3wsAbzftBc&hl=en&ei=eq_SSsG8C5PIlAex5_SoCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=huns%20caucasus%20barrier%20395&f=false see excerpt]) ({{ISBN|978-3-16-147520-7}})</ref>\n\n====Alexander's Wall in Christian legends====\n{{Main|Gates of Alexander}}\nChristian legends speak of the Caspian Gates (Gates of Alexander), also known as Alexander's wall, built by Alexander the Great in the [[Caucasus mountains]]. Several variations of the legend can be found. In the story, Alexander the Great built a gate of iron between two mountains, at the end of the [[flat Earth|Earth]], to prevent the armies of [[Gog and Magog]] from ravaging the plains. The Christian legend was written in [[Syria]] shortly before the Quran's writing and closely parallels the story of Dhul-Qarnayn.<ref>[[#Southgate1978|Southgate 1978]].</ref> The legend describes an [[apocryphal]] letter from Alexander to his mother, wherein he writes:\n\n<blockquote>I petitioned the exalted Deity, and he heard my prayer. And the exalted Deity commanded the two mountains and they moved and approached each other to a distance of twelve [[ell]]s, and there I made ... copper gates 12 ells broad, and 60 ells high, and smeared them over within and without with copper ... so that neither fire nor iron, nor any other means should be able to loosen the copper; ... Within these gates, I made another construction of stones ... And having done this I finished the construction by putting mixed tin and lead over the stones, and smearing .... over the whole, so that no one might be able to do anything against the gates. I called them the Caspian Gates. Twenty and two Kings did I shut up therein.<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThese [[pseudepigraphic]] letters from Alexander to his mother Olympias and his tutor Aristotle, describing his marvellous adventures at the end of the World, date back to the original Greek [[Alexander romance|recension \u03b1]] written in the 4th century in Alexandria.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the Gates of Alexander story was included in travel literature such as the ''[[Travels of Marco Polo]]'' (1254\u20131324 AD) and the ''[[Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]''. The ''Alexander romance'' identified the Gates of Alexander, variously, with the [[Pass of Dariel]], the [[Derbent|Pass of Derbent]], the [[Great Wall of Gorgan]] and even the [[Great Wall of China]]. In the legend's original form, Alexander's Gates are located at the Pass of Dariel. In later versions of the Christian legends,  dated to around the time of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (575\u2013641 AD), the Gates are instead located in [[Derbent]], a city  situated on a narrow strip of land between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus mountains, where an ancient [[Sassanid]] fortification was mistakenly identified with the wall built by Alexander. In the ''[[Travels of Marco Polo]]'', the wall in Derbent is identified with the Gates of Alexander. The [[Gates of Alexander]] are most commonly identified with the [[Caspian Gates of Derbent]] whose thirty north-looking towers used to stretch for forty kilometres between the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains]], effectively blocking the passage across the Caucasus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Bretschneider1876|Bretschneider 1876]].</ref> Later historians would regard these legends as false:\n\n<blockquote>The gate itself had wandered from the Caspian Gates to the pass of Dariel, from the pass of Dariel to the pass of Derbend [Derbent], as well as to the far north; nay, it had travelled even as far as remote eastern or north-eastern Asia, gathering in strength and increasing in size as it went, and actually carrying the mountains of Caspia with it. Then, as the full light of modern day come on, the ''Alexander Romance'' ceased to be regarded as history, and with it Alexander's Gate passed into the realm of [[fairy]]land.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book |editor1-first= Andrew Runni |editor1-last= Anderson |title= Alexander's Gate, Gog and Magog, and the enclosed nations |date=January 1932  |publisher= [[Medieval Academy of America]] |location= [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |isbn= 978-0-910956-07-9}}\n</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the Muslim world, several expeditions were undertaken to try to find and study Alexanders's wall, specifically the [[Caspian Gates of Derbent]].

The expedition was led by [[Sallam-ul-Tarjuman]], whose observations were recorded by [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] and by [[Ibn Kathir]]:\n\n<blockquote>...this expedition reached ... the Caspian territory. From there they arrived at Derbent and saw the wall [of Dhul-Qarnayn].<ref name=\"al-Hamawi\">Mu'jam-ul-Buldan, Yaqut al-Hamawi</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe Muslim geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] further confirmed the same view in a number of places in his book on geography; for instance under the heading \"Khazar\" (Caspian) he writes:\n\n<blockquote>This territory adjoins the Wall of Dhul-Qarnain just behind Bab-ul-Abwab, which is also called Derbent.<ref name=\"al-Hamawi\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] (763 \u2013 809 AD) even spent some time living in Derbent.  Not all Muslim travellers and scholars, however, associated Dhul-Qarnayn's wall with the Caspian Gates of Derbent. For example, the Muslim explorer [[Ibn Battuta]] (1304\u20131369 AD) travelled to China on order of the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] and he comments in his travel log that \"Between it [the city of [[Quanzhou|Zaitun]] in [[Fujian]]] and the rampart of Yajuj and Majuj [Gog and Magog] is sixty days' travel.\"<ref name=\"F. Beckingham p. 896\">[[Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|H. A. R. Gibb]] and C. F. Beckingham, trans. ''The Travels of Ibn Battuta, A.D. 1325\u20131354'' (Vol. IV).

In Islamic [[eschatology]], before the Day of Judgement Gog and Magog will destroy this gate, allowing them to ravage the Earth, as it is described in the Quran:\n\n:Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose [from their barrier], and they swiftly swarm from every mound.  And the true promise [Day of Resurrection] shall draw near [of fulfilment]. Then [when mankind is resurrected from their graves], you shall see the eyes of the disbelievers fixedly stare in horror.  [They will say,] \u2018Woe to us!  We were indeed heedless of this; nay, but we were wrongdoers.\u2019 (Quran 21:96\u201397. Note that the phrases in square brackets are not in the Arabic original.)\n\n====Gog and Magog in Christian legends====\n[[File:Radkarte MKL1888.png|thumb|200px|Example of a [[T and O map|T-O map]] appearing in a German encyclopedia published by [[Joseph Meyer (publisher)|Joseph Meyer]] (1796-1856 AD). The T-O map was the first printed map in Europe. The map shows a disc shaped Earth surrounded by [[Oceanus]], with the location [[Gog and Magog]] to the north, and [[Paropamisadae]] mountains ([[Hindu Kush]]) to the east in Asia. In the Christian legends, Alexander built the wall against Gog and Magog in the north, near the Caspian sea, and then went to the ends of the earth at the Paropamisadae, where it was supposed that the sun rises.]]\n\nIn the Syriac Christian legends, Alexander the Great encloses the Gog and Magog horde behind a mighty gate between two mountains, preventing Gog and Magog from invading the Earth. In addition, it is written in the Christian legend that in the [[end time]]s God will cause the Gate of Gog and Magog to be destroyed, allowing the Gog and Magog horde to ravage the Earth;\n\n<blockquote>The Lord spake by the hand of the angel, [saying] ...The gate of the north shall be opened on the day of the end of the world, and on that day shall evil go forth on the wicked ... The earth shall quake and this door [gate] which thou [Alexander] hast made be opened ... and anger with fierce wrath shall rise up on mankind and the earth ... shall be laid waste ... And the nations that is within this gate shall be roused up, and also the host of Agog and the peoples of Magog [Gog and Magog] shall be gathered together. These peoples, the fiercest of all creatures.<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThe Christian Syriac legend describes a [[flat Earth]] orbited by the [[sun]] and surrounded by the [[Paropamisadae]] (Hindu Kush) mountains. The Paropamisadae mountains are  in turn surrounded by a narrow tract of land which is followed by a treacherous Ocean sea called [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]]. It is within this tract of land between the [[Paropamisadae]] mountains and [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]] that Alexander encloses Gog and Magog, so that they could not cross the mountains and invade the Earth. The legend describes \"the old wise men\" explaining this [[geography]] and [[cosmology]] of the Earth to Alexander, and then Alexander setting out to enclose Gog and Magog behind a mighty gate between a narrow passage at the end of the flat Earth:\n\n<blockquote>The old men say, \"Look, my lord the king, and see a wonder, this mountain which God has set as a great boundary.\" King Alexander the son of Philip said, \"How far is the extent of this mountain?\" The old men say, \"Beyond India it extends in its appearance.\" The king said, \"How far does this side come?\" The old men say, \"Unto all the end of the earth.\" And wonder seized the great king at the council of the old men ... And he had it in his mind to make there a great gate. His mind was full of spiritual thoughts, while taking advice from the old men, the dwellers in the land. He looked at the mountain which encircled the whole world ... The king said, \"Where have the hosts [of Gog and Magog] come forth to plunder the land and all the world from of old?\" They show him a place in the middle of the mountains, a narrow pass which had been constructed by God ...<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\n[[Flat Earth#Early Christian Church|Flat Earth beliefs in the Early Christian Church]] varied and the Fathers of the Church shared different approaches. Those of them who were more close to [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]'s visions, like [[Origen]], shared peacefully the belief in a [[spherical Earth]]. A second tradition, including [[St Basil]] and [[St Augustine]], accepted the idea of the round Earth and the radial gravity, but in a critical way. In particular they pointed out a number of doubts about the [[antipodes]] and the physical reasons of the radial gravity. However, a flat Earth approach was more or less shared by all the Fathers coming from the Syriac area, who were more inclined to follow the letter of the [[Old Testament]]. [[Diodore of Tarsus]] (?\u2013390 AD), [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] (6th century), and [[Chrysostom]] (347\u2013407 AD) belonged to this flat Earth tradition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Leone Montagnini, \"La questione della forma della Terra.

In his 9th century work ''[[Expositio in Matthaeum Evangelistam]]'', the [[Benedictine]] monk [[Christian of Stavelot]]  refers to the Khazars as [[Huns|Hunnic]] descendants of Gog and Magog, and says they are ''\"circumcised and observing all [the laws of] Judaism\"'';<ref>Kevin Alan Brook. ''The Jews of Khazaria.'' 2nd ed. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc, 2006.</ref> the Khazars were a [[Central Asia]]n people with a long association with [[Judaism]]. A [[Georgian people|Georgian]] tradition, echoed in a chronicle, also identifies the Khazars with Gog and Magog, stating they are ''\"wild men with hideous faces and the manners of wild beasts, eaters of blood.\"''<ref>Schultze (1905), p. 23.{{Verify source|date=May 2009}}</ref>\n\nEarly Muslim scholars writing about Dhul-Qarnayn also associated Gog and Magog with the Khazars. [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301\u20131373 CE), the famous commentator of the Quran, identified Gog and Magog with the Khazars who lived between the Black and [[Caspian Sea]] in his work ''[[Al-Bidayah wa al-Nihayah]]'' (''The Beginning and the End'').<ref>[[Ibn Kathir]], ''Al-Bidayah wa'l-Nihayah (The Beginning and the End)''</ref><ref>Ibn Kathir, \"Stories of the Prophets\", page 54. Riyadh, SA Maktaba Dar-us-Salam, 2003</ref> The Muslim explorer [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]], in his travelogue regarding his diplomatic mission in 921 AD to [[Volga Bulgars]] (a [[vassal]] of the [[khazaria|Khazarian Empire]]), noted the beliefs about Gog and Magog being the ancestors of the Khazars.<ref>''Collection of Geographical Works by Ibn al-Faqih, Ibn Fadlan, Abu Dulaf Al-Khazraji'', ed. Fuat Sezgin, Frankfurt am Main, 1987</ref>\n\nThus Muslim scholars associated the Khazars with Dhul-Qarnayn just as the Christian legends associated the Khazars with Alexander the Great.\n\n===The rising place of the Sun===\n{{Primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}\nA peculiar aspect of the story of Dhul-Qarnayn, in the Quran, is that it describes Dhul-Qarnayn travelling to \"the rising place of the Sun\" and the \"setting place of the Sun,\" where he saw the Sun sets into a murky (or boiling) spring of water (or mud). Dhul-Qarnayn also finds a people living by the \"rising place of the Sun,\" and finds that these people somehow have \"no shelter.\"\n\nIn his commentary of the Quran, [[Ibn Kathir]]  (1301\u20131373 CE) explains that verse 18:89 is referring to the furthest point that could be travelled west:\n\n<blockquote>(Until, when he reached the setting place of the sun,) means, he followed a route until ''he reached the furthest point that could be reached in the direction of the sun's setting, which is the west of the earth.'' As for the idea of his reaching the place in the sky where the sun sets, this is something impossible, and the tales told by storytellers that he traveled so far to the west that the sun set behind him are not true at all. Most of these stories come from the myths of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] and the fabrications and lies of their heretics.<ref>Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah Al-Kahf 18:89, ''His traveling and reaching the Place where the Sun sets (the West)'' ([http://www.theholybook.org/content/view/7823/2/ link])</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn this commentary Ibn Kathir differentiates between the end of the Earth and the supposed \"place in the sky\" where the sun sets (the \"resting place\" of the sun. Ibn Kathir contends that Dhul-Qarnayn did reach the farthest place that could be travelled west but not the \"resting place\" of the sun and he goes on to mention that the [[People of the Book]] (Jews and Christians) tell myths about Dhul-Qarnayn travelling so far beyond the end of the Earth that the sun was \"behind him.\" This shows that Ibn Kathir was aware of the Christian legends and it suggests that Ibn Kathir considered Christian myths about Alexander to be referring to the same figure as the Dhul-Qarnayn mentioned in the Qu'an.\n\nA similar theme is elaborated upon in several places in the Islamic [[hadith]] literature, in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]:\n\n<blockquote>It is narrated ... that the Messenger of Allah one day said: Do you know where the sun goes? They replied: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Verily it (the sun) glides till it reaches its resting place under the Throne [of Allah]. Then it falls prostrate and remains there until it is asked: Rise up and go to the place whence you came, and it goes back and continues emerging out from its rising place...<ref>Sahih Muslim 1:297</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe setting place of the sun is also commented on by [[Al-Tabari]] (838-923 AD) and [[Al-Qurtubi]] (1214\u20131273 AD) and, like [[Ibn Kathir]], they showed some reservations towards the literal idea of the sun setting in a muddy spring but held to the basic theme of Dhul-Qarnayn reaching the ends of the Earth.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hockney|first1=Mike|title=World, Underworld, Overworld, Dreamworld|date=2014|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc.|isbn=9781326016579}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=June 2018}}\n\nThat the Earth must be spherical was known since at least the time of [[Pythagoras]] (570\u2013495 BC), but this knowledge did not reach ancient folklore such as the ''Alexander romance'' where Alexander travels to the ends of a flat Earth. It is notable that, unlike the Babylonians, Greeks, and Indians, the [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabs]] had no scientific astronomy. Their knowledge of astronomy was limited to measuring time based on empirical observations of the \"rising and setting\" of the sun, moon, and particular stars. This area of astronomical study was known as ''anwa'' and continued to be developed after [[Islamization]] by the Arabs.<ref name=\"Dallal\">Dallal, Ahmad (1999), \"Science, Medicine and Technology\", in Esposito, John, The Oxford History of Islam, Oxford University Press, New York, pg. 162</ref>  [[Astronomy in medieval Islam]] began in the 8th century and the first major Muslim work of astronomy was ''Zij al-Sindh'' written in 830 by [[Muhammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b|al-Khwarizmi]].  The work is significant as it introduced the [[Ptolemaic system]] into Islamic sciences (the Ptolemaic system was ultimately replaced by the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in Europe).\n\n====The rising place of the Sun in the Alexander legends====\n<div style=\"float:right\">\n{{Gallery\n|lines=15\n|File:Map homer world.jpg|Rendition of [[Homer]]'s view of the world (prior to 900 BC). The Homeric conception of the world involved a flat, circular Earth, surrounded by mountains and by [[Oceanus]],  the world-ocean of [[classical antiquity]], considered to be an enormous river encircling the world. The Sun emerges from underneath the Earth, travelling along the fixed dome of the sky, and is shown rising from Oceanus.\n}}</div>\n\n<blockquote> The place of his [the Sun's] rising is over the sea, and the people who dwell there, when he is about to rise, flee away and hide themselves in the sea, that they be not burnt by his rays; and he passes through the midst of heaven to the place where he enters the window of heaven; and wherever he passes there are terrible mountains, and those who dwell there have caves hollowed out in the rocks, and as soon as they see the Sun passing [over them], men and birds flee away from before him and hide in the caves ... And when the Sun enters the window of heaven, he [it] straight away bows down and makes obeisance before God his Creator; and he travels and descends the whole night through the heavens, until at length he finds himself where he [the Sun] rises ... So the whole camp mounted, and Alexander and his troops went up between the fetid sea and the bright sea to the place where the Sun enters the window of heaven; for the Sun is the servant of the Lord, and neither by night nor by day does he cease from his travelling.<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThe Christian legend is much more detailed than the Quran's version and elaborates at length about the [[cosmology]] of the Earth that is implied by the story:\n\n<blockquote>He [Alexander] said to them [the nobles]:  \"This thought has arisen in my mind, and I am wondering what is the extent of the earth, and how high the heavens are ... and upon what the heavens are fixed ... Now this I desire to go and see, upon what the heavens rest, and what surrounds all creation.\" The nobles answered and said to the king, ... \"As to the thing, my lord, which thy majesty desires to go and see, namely, upon what the heaveans rest, and what surrounds the earth, the terrible seas which surround the world will not give thee a passage; because there are eleven bright seas, on which the ships of men sail, and beyond these there is about ten miles of dry land, and beyond these ten miles there is the foetid sea, [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]] (the Ocean), which surrounds all creation. Men are not able to come near to this foetid sea ... Its waters are like poison and if men swim therein, they die at once.\"<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThis ancient [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] of a legendary figure travelling to the end of Earth is also found in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], which can be dated to c. 2000 BC, making it one of the earliest known works of literary writing.<ref name=Markaz>Sattari J., \"A study on the epic of Gilgamesh and the legend of Alexander.\" Markaz Publications 2001 (In Persian)</ref> In the [[epic poem]], in tablet nine, Gilgamesh sets out on a quest for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] to seek immortality. Gilgamesh travels far to the east, to the mountain passes at the ends of the earth where he grapples and slays monstrous mountain lions, bears and others. Eventually he comes to the twin peaks of Mount Mashu at the end of the earth, from where the sun rises from the other world, the gate of which is guarded by two terrible scorpion-beings. They allow him to proceed through the gate after Gilgamesh convinces them to let him pass, stating his divinity and desperation, and he travels through the dark tunnel where the sun travels every night. Just before the sun is about to catch up with him, and with the North Wind and ice lashing him, he reaches the end. The world at the end of the tunnel is a bright wonderland full of trees with leaves of jewels. The 17th chapter of the apocryphal [[Book of Enoch]] describes a journey to the far west where the fire of the west receives every setting of the sun and a river of fire empties into the great western sea.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/boe020.htm |title = The Book of Enoch: Enoch's Journeys through the Earth and Sheol: Chapter XVII}}</ref> Chapters 72\u201380 describe the risings and settings of the sun through 12 portals of heaven in the east and west.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/boe075.htm |title = The Book of Enoch: The Book of the Courses of the Heavenly Luminaries: Chapter LXXII}}</ref> The myth of a flat Earth surrounded by an Ocean into which the sun sets is also found in the [[Iliad]], the famous epic poem written by [[Homer]] and dated to c. 900 BC. The story of creation in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:10, (dated c. 900\u2013550 BC) is also considered by scholars to be describing a flat Earth surrounded by a sea.<ref>[[#Seely1997|Seely 1997]].</ref>\n\nThe ancient Greek historian [[Herodotus]] (484\u2013425 BC) also gave an account of the eastern \"end of the Earth,\" in his descriptions of India. He reported that in India the sun's heat is extremely intense in the morning, instead of noon being the hottest time of day. It has been argued that he based this on his belief that since India is located at the extreme east of a flat Earth, it would only be logical if the morning were unbearably hot due to the sun's proximity.<ref>How, Walter W. and Wells, J. A Commentary on Herodotus. Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1912. vol 1. p. 290.</ref>\n\n===Alexander's travels===\n[[File:Map-alexander-empire.png|thumb|right|Map of Alexander's travels. Alexander never marched far west of his native [[Macedon]] and his advances eastward ended at the fringes of India.]]\n\nThe Quran and the ''Alexander romance'' both have it that Dhul-Qarnayn (or Alexander) travelled a great deal. In the Quran's story of Dhul-Qarnayn, \"God gave him unto every thing a road\" (or more literally, \"We gave him the means of everything\" 18:84) He travels as far as the ends of the Earth, to the place on the Earth where the Sun sets (the west) and the place on the Earth where the Sun rises (the east). The Quran portrays him travelling to the \"setting of the sun.\" Muslim interpretations of these verses are varied, but classical Muslim scholars seemed to have been of the opinion that Dhul-Qarnayn's journey was real, not [[allegorical]], and that Dhul-Qarnayn's wall is also a real, physical wall somewhere on Earth.\n\nIn the Christian legends, Alexander travels to the places of the setting and rising of the Sun and this is meant to say that he travelled to the ends of the [[flat Earth]] and thus he had traversed the entire world. This legendary account served to convey the theme of Alexander's exploits as a great conqueror. Alexander was indeed a great conqueror, having ruled the largest empire in [[ancient history]] by the time he was 25 years old. However, the true historical extent of Alexander's travels are known to be greatly exaggerated in legends. For example, legend has it that upon reaching India,\n\n<blockquote>... said Alexander 'Truly, then, all the inhabited world is mine. West, north, east, south, there is nothing more for me to conquer.' Then he sat down and wept because there were not other worlds for him to conquer.<ref>[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=baldwin&book=thirty&story=alexander Thirty Most Famous Stories Retold], James Baldwin (1841\u20131925)</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn reality, while Alexander did travel a great deal, he did not travel further west than [[ancient Libya]] and did not travel further east than the fringes of India. According to historians, Alexander invaded India following his desire to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea.\" However, when he reached the [[Hyphasis River]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in 326 BC, his army nearly [[mutiny|mutinied]] and refused to march further east, exhausted by years of campaigning. Alexander's desire to reach \"the ends of the Earth\" was instilled by his tutor [[Aristotle]]:\n\n<blockquote>Alexander derived his concept of `Asia' from the teaching of Aristotle, for whom `the inhabited earth' was surrounded by `the Great sea' Ocean, and was divided into three areas \u2013 `Europe, Libya and Asia.' Thus the earth was not round but flat, and `Asia' was limited on the west by the [[Tanais]] (Don), the inland sea and the Nile, and on the east by `India' and `the Great Sea' ... he was mistaken in supposing that from the ridge of the [[Paropamisadae]] (Hindu Kush) one would see `the outer sea' and that `India' was a small peninsula running east into that sea.<ref>[[#Hammond1998|Hammond 1998]].</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis view of the world taught by Aristotle and followed by Alexander is apparent in Aristotle's ''[[Meteorologica]]'', a treatise on earth sciences where he discusses the \"length\" and \"width\" of \"the inhabited earth.\" However, Aristotle knew that the Earth is spherical and even provided observational proof of this fact. Aristotle's cosmological view was that the Earth is round but he prescribed to the notion of an \"inhabited Earth,\" surrounded by the Ocean, and an \"uninhabited Earth\" (though exactly how much of this was understood by his student Alexander the Great is not known).\n\n==Islamic depictions of Alexander the Great==\n\n===Arabic traditions===\n[[File:secret of secrets a.jpg|thumb|174px|right|Manuscript of the 9th-century Arabic work ''[[Secretum Secretorum]]'' (\"Secret of Secrets\"), an encyclopedic treatise on a wide range of topics including [[physiognomy]], [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[medicine]]. This work includes a series of supposed letters from [[Aristotle]], addressed to Alexander. The Arabic manuscript was translated into [[Latin]] in the 12th century and was influential in Europe during the [[High Middle Ages]] ]]\n\nAlexander the Great features prominently in early Arabic literature. There are many surviving versions of the ''Alexander romance'' in Arabic that were written after the conquest of Islam. It is also thought that pre-Islamic [[Arabic]] versions of the ''Alexander romance'' may have existed.<ref name=doufikar-aertis>Doufikar-Aerts, Faustina (2003). ''The Last Days of Alexander in an Arabic Popular Romance of Al-Iskandar.'' in ''The Ancient Novel and Beyond'' by Panayotakis, Zimmerman and Keulen.</ref>\n\nThe earliest surviving Arabic narrative of the Alexander romance was composed by [[Umara ibn Zayd]] (767\u2013815 AD). In the tale, Alexander travels a great deal, builds the Wall against Gog and Magog, searches for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] (Fountain of Youth), and encounters angels who give him a   \"wonder-stone\" that both weighs more than any other stone but is also as light as dust. This wonder-stone is meant to admonish Alexander for his ambitions and indicate that his lust for conquest and eternal life will not end until his death. The story of the wonder-stone is not found in the Syriac Christian legend, but is found in Jewish [[Talmudic]] traditions about Alexander as well as in Persian traditions.<ref name=stoneman2003/><ref>Southgate, Minoo.

''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 97, No. 3, (July \u2013 September 1977), pp. 278-\u2013284</ref>\n\nA [[Arabian peninsula|South Arabian]] Alexander legend was written by the [[Yemen]]ite traditionist [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] (?\u2013732 AD) and this legend was later incorporated in a book by [[Ibn Hisham]] (?\u2013833 AD) regarding the history of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] in ancient Yemen. In the Yemenite variation, Dhul-Qarnayn is identified with an ancient king of Yemen named [[Tubba']], rather than Alexander the Great, but the Arabic story still describes the story of Alexander's Wall against Gog and Magog and his quest for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]. The story also mentions that Dhul-Qarnayn (Tubba') visited a castle with glass walls and visited the [[Brahmins]] of India. The South Arabian legend was composed within the context of the division between the South Arabs and North Arabs that began with the [[Battle of Marj Rahit (684)|Battle of Marj Rahit]] in 684 AD and consolidated over two centuries.<ref name=stoneman2003/>\n\nThe ''Alexander romance'' also had an important influence on Arabic [[wisdom literature]]. In ''[[Secretum Secretorum]]'' (\"Secret of Secrets\", in Arabic ''Kitab sirr al-asrar''), an encyclopedic Arabic treatise on a wide range of topics such as [[Public administration|statecraft]], [[ethics]], [[physiognomy]], [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[medicine]], Alexander appears as a speaker and subject of wise sayings and as a correspondent with figures such as [[Aristotle]]. The origins of the treatise are uncertain. No [[Greek language|Greek]] original exists, though there are claims in the Arabic treatise that it was translated from the Greek into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and from Syriac into Arabic by a well-known 9th century translator, [[Yahya ibn al-Bitriq]] (?\u2013815 AD). It appears, however, that the treatise was actually composed originally in Arabic.\n\nIn another example of Arabic wisdom literature relating to Alexander, [[Ibn al-Nadim]] (?\u2013997 AD) refers to a work on [[divination]] titled ''The Drawing of Lots by Dhul-Qarnain'' and to a second work on divination by arrows titled ''The gift of Alexander'', but only the titles of these works have survived.\n\nNotably, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mu'tasim]] (794\u2013842 AD) had ordered the translation of the ''[[Thesaurus Alexandri]]'', a work on [[elixirs]] and [[amulets]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] into Arabic. The Greek work ''Thesaurus Alexandri'' was attributed to [[Hermes]] (the great messenger of the gods in [[Greek mythology]]) and similarly contained supposed letters from Aristotle addressed to Alexander.<ref name=stoneman2003/><ref>Yucesoy, Hayrettin. ''Messianic Beliefs & Imperial Politics in Medieval Islam: The Abbasid Caliphate in the Early Ninth Century''. 2009. University of South Carolina. pp. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nA more direct Arabic translation of the ''Alexander romance,'' called ''Sirat Al-Iskandar'', was discovered in [[Constantinople]], at the [[Hagia Sophia]], and is dated to the 13th century. This version includes the letter from Alexander to his mother about his travels in India and at the end of the World. It also includes features which occur exclusively in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version. The Arabic legend also retains certain [[pagan]] elements of the story, which are sometimes modified to suit the Islamic message:\n\n<blockquote>It is quite remarkable that some characteristics belonging to a pre-Islamic 'pagan' entourage, have survived in the text ... For example, Alexander orders an offering of sacrificial animals at the temple of [[Hercules]]. In the Arabic letter the name of the deity has been replaced by ''[[Allah]]'' ... Another passage in the account of the palace of Shoshan or Sus, gives a description of the large silver jars, which were alleged to have capacity of three hundred and sixty measures of wine. Alexander puts this assertion to the test, having one of the jars filled with wine and poured out for his soldiers during a banquet. This exact specification has been maintained, heedless of the Islamic ban on the use of wine ... These retouched borrowings are highly significant in this text, because the Arabic Alexander figure is portrayed as a propagator of Islamic monotheism.<ref name=doufikar-aertis/></blockquote>\n\nAnother piece of Arabic Alexander literature is the ''Laments (or Sayings) of the Philosophers''. These are a collection of remarks supposedly made by some philosophers gathered at the tomb of Alexander after his death. This legend was originally written in the 6th century in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and was later translated into [[Arabic]] and expanded upon. The ''Laments of the Philosophers'' eventually gained enormous popularity in Europe:<ref name=Brock1970/>\n\n<blockquote>[The 'Sayings of the Philosophers' are] remarks of the philosophers gathered at the tomb of Alexander, who utter a series of [[Apophthegmata Patrum|apophthegms]] on the theme of the brevity of life and the transience of human achievement ... a work entitled 'Sayings of the Philosophers' was first composed in Syriac in the sixth century; a longer Arabic version was composed by [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq|Hunayan Ibn Ishaq]] (809-973) the distinguished scholar-translator, and a still longer one by al-Mubashshir ibn Fatiq (who also wrote a book about Alexander) around 1053. Hunayan's version was translated into Spanish ... in the late thirteenth century.<ref>Hofmann, Heinz. ''Latin fiction: the Latin novel in context.'' Routledge, 1999. p.245</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Arabic ''Alexander romance'' also had an influence on a wider range of Arabic literature. It has been noted that some features of the Arabic Alexander legends found their way into ''[[Sinbad the Sailor|The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor]]'', a medieval story-cycle of Arabic origin. Sinbad, the hero of the epic, is a fictional [[sailor]] from [[Basrah]], living during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. During his voyages throughout the seas east of Africa and south of Asia, he has fantastic adventures going to magical places, meeting monsters, and encountering supernatural phenomena. As a separate example of this influence on Arabic literature, the legend of Alexander's search for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] is found in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', a collection of [[Middle East]]ern and [[South Asia]]n stories and [[Folklore|folktales]] compiled in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].<ref name=stoneman2003/>\n\n===Andalusian traditions===\n[[File:Poema de Yusuf.jpg|thumb|Manuscript of a 14th-century poem (''Poema de Yu\u00e7uf'') written in [[Aljamiado]] (Spanish and [[Mozarabic]] language [[transliterated]] in [[Arabic alphabet]]).]]\n\nAfter the [[Umayyad]] Muslim conquest of [[Al-Andalus]] (Spain) in 711 AD, Muslim literature flourished under the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] (929 to 1031 AD). An  [[Arabic]] derivative of the ''Alexander romance'' was produced, called ''Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn'' (''Tales of Dhul-Qarnayn'').<ref name=Zuwiyya2001/> The material was later incorporated into ''[[Qisas Al-Anbiya]]'' (''Tales of the Prophets''):\n\n<blockquote>By the turn of the first millennium C.E., the romance of Alexander in Arabic had a core centered on the Greek legendary material ... Interwoven later into this narrative in the ''Tales of the Prophets'' literature were episodes of an apparent Arab-Islamic elaboration: the construction of a great barrier to keep the people of Gog and Magog from harassing the people of the civilized world until Judgement Day, the voyage to the end of the Earth to witness the sun set in a pool of boiling mud, and Dhu al-Qarnayn's expedition into the [[Land of Darkness]] in search of the [[Fountain of Youth|Fountain of Life]] accompanied by his companion [[Al-Khidir|Khidir]] (\"the Green-One\").<ref name=Zuwiyya2009/></blockquote>\n\nBy 1236 AD, the [[Reconquista]] was essentially completed and Europeans had retaken the [[Iberian peninsula]] from the Muslims, but the [[Emirate of Granada]], a small Muslim vassal of the Christian [[Kingdom of Castile]], remained in Spain until 1492 AD. During the Reconquista, Muslims were forced to either convert to [[Catholicism]] or leave the peninsula. The descendants of Muslims who converted to Christianity were called the [[Morisco]]s (meaning \"[[Moors|Moor]]-like\") and were suspecting of secretly practicing Islam. The Moriscos used a language called [[Aljamiado]], which was a dialect of the Spanish language ([[Mozarabic]]) but was written using the [[Arabic alphabet]]. Aljamiado played a very important role in preserving Islam and the Arabic language in the life of the Moriscos; prayers and the sayings of Muhammad were translated into Aljamiado transcriptions of the Spanish language, while keeping all Quranic verses in the original Arabic. During this period, a version of the Alexander legend was written in the Aljamaido language, building on the Arabic ''Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn'' legends as well as [[Romance language]] versions of the ''Alexander romance''.<ref>Zuwiyya, David Z. \"Translation and the Arat of Recreation: The legend of Alexander the Great from the ''Pseudo-Callisthenes'' to the Aljamiado-Morisco ''Rrekontamiento del rrey Alisandre''\" in ''Sensus de sensu: Estudios filol\u00f3gicos de traducci\u00f3n''.

For example, Pseudo-Callisthenes is the source of many incidents in the ''[[Shahnama]]'' written by [[Ferdowsi]] (935\u20131020 AD) in [[New Persian]]. Persian sources on the Alexander legend devised a mythical genealogy for him whereby his mother was a concubine of [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]], making him the half-brother of the last Achaemenid [[shah]], [[Darius III of Persia|Darius]]. By the 12th century such important writers as [[Nizami Ganjavi]] (from [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Azerbaijan]]) were making him the subject of their [[Epic poetry|epic poems]]. The Muslim traditions also elaborated the legend that Alexander the Great had been the companion of [[Aristotle]] and the direct student of [[Plato]].\n\nThere is also evidence that the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translation of the ''Alexander romance'', dating to the 6th century, was not directly based on the Greek recensions but was based on a lost  [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] (pre-Islamic Persian) manuscript.<ref name=doufikar-aertis/>\n\n===Central Asian traditions===\n\nCertain Muslim people of [[Central Asia]], specifically [[Bulgars|Bulgar]], [[Tatar]] and [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] peoples of the [[Volga]]-[[Ural (region)|Ural]] region (within what is today [[Tatarstan]] in the [[Russian Federation]]), carried on a rich tradition of the Alexander legend well into the 19th century. The region was conquered by the [[Abbasid]] Caliphate in the early 10th century. In these legends, Alexander is referred to as ''[[Alexander III of Macedon|Iskandar]] Dhul-Qarnayn'' (Alexander the Two Horned), and is \"depicted as founder of local cities and an ancestor of local figures.\" The local folklore about ''Iskandar Dhul-Qarnayn'' played in an important role in communal identity:\n\n<blockquote>The conversion of the [[Volga Bulghars]] to Islam is commonly dated to the first decades of the 10th century, and by the middle of the 12th century, it is apparent that Islamic historical figures and Islamic forms of communal validation had become important factors for Bulghar communal and political cohesion. The [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] traveler Ab\u016b Hamid al-Gharn\u0101ti who visited Bulghar in the 1150s, noted that Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn passed through Bulghar, that is, the [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga-Kama]] region, on his way to build the iron walls that contained Y\u0101'j\u016bj and M\u0101'j\u016bj [Gog and Magog] within the [[land of darkness]] ... while Najib al-Hamad\u0101ni reports that the rulers of Bulghar claimed descent from Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn.<ref name=frank>{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=Allen J. |year=2000 |title=Historical Legends of the Volga-Ural Muslims concerning Alexander the Great, the City of Yelabuga, and B\u0101chm\u0101n Kh\u0101n |journal= Revue des mondes musulmans et de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e |volume=89-90 |issue=89\u201390 |pages=89\u2013107 |doi=10.4000/remmm.274|doi-access=free }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ''Iskandar Dhul-Qanryan'' legends played an important role in the conversion narrative of the Volga Bulgar Muslims:\n\n<blockquote>There are numerous digressions dealing with the founding of the Bulghar conversion narrative, and legends concerning Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn [Alexander Dhul-Qarnayn]  and [[Socrates]]. According to the account, Socrates was born a Christian in [[Samarqand]] and went to Greece to serve Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn (Iskandar R\u016bmi). Together, they went to the [[Land of Darkness]] (diy\u0101r-i zulmat) to seek the [[Fountain of Youth]] (\u0101b-i hay\u0101t). In the northern lands they built a city and called it Bulghar.<ref name=frank/> </blockquote>\n\nIn 1577 AD the [[Tsardom of Russia]] annexed control of the region and Bulgar Muslim writings concerning Dhul-Qarnayn do not appear again until the 18th and 19th centuries, which saw a resurgence of local ''Iskandar Dhul-Qarnayn'' legends as a source of Muslim and ethnic identity:\n\n<blockquote>It was only at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries that we begin to see historical legends concerning Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn reemerge among [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga-Kama]] Muslims, at least in written form, and it was not until the 19th century that such legends were recorded from local Muslim oral tradition. In one of his earliest historical works, entitled Ghil\u0101lat al-Zam\u0101n and written in 1877 the Tatar theologian, Shih\u0101b al-D\u012bn Marj\u0101n\u012b wrote that according to Arabic and other Muslim writings, as well as according to popular legends, the city of Bulghar was founded by Alexander the Great.<ref name=frank/> </blockquote>\n\n== Orientalist and western views ==\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] studying the Quran began researching the identity of Dhul-Qarnayn. Theodor N\u00f6ldeke, believed that Dhul-Qarnayn was none other than Alexander the Great as mentioned in versions of the ''Alexander romance'' and related literature in Syriac (a dialect of [[Aramaic|Middle Aramaic]]).<ref>[[#Noldeke|N\u00f6ldeke]].</ref> The Syriac manuscripts were translated into English in 1889 by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]].<ref name=budge1889>[[#Budge1889|Budge 1889]].</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century [[Andrew Runni Anderson]] wrote a series of articles on the question in the ''Transactions of the [[American Philological Association]]''.<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\">[[#Anderson1927|Anderson 1927]].</ref> The findings of the [[philologists]] imply that the source of the Quran's story of Dhul-Qarnayn is the ''Alexander romance'', a thoroughly embellished compilation of Alexander's exploits from [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and early [[Christianity|Christian]] sources, which underwent numerous expansions and revisions for two-thousand years, throughout [[ancient history|Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"Edwards 2002\"/>\n\nAs can be seen in the following quotation from Edwards, secular [[philologists]] studying ancient [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] [[legend]]s about Alexander the Great also came to the conclusion that Dhul-Qarnayn is an ancient [[epithet]] for Alexander the Great. Edwards says, <blockquote>Alexander's association with two horns and with the building of the gate against Gog and Magog occurs much earlier than the Quran and persists in the beliefs of all three of these religions [Judaism, Christianity and Islam]. The denial of Alexander's identity as Dhul-Qarnain is the denial of a common heritage shared by the cultures which shape the modern world\u2014both in the east and the west. The popularity of the legend of Alexander the Great proves that these cultures share a history which suggests that perhaps they are not so different after all.<ref name=\"Edwards 2002\">[[#Edwards2002|Edwards 2002]].</ref></blockquote>Although modern academics have found that the oldest Alexander romance does not contain the episode where Alexander build the gates against Gog and Magog,<blockquote>The Syriac tradition is one of the most interesting versions of the many existing oriental redactions of the Romance. It dates from the 7th century and goes back on a quite similar Vorlage of the Greek recensio vetusta (n).4 The Syrian redactor, probably an East Syrian Christian, added a certain number of until then unknown episodes to the text. The episode of Alexander's building a wall against Gog and Magog, however, is not found in the oldest Greek, Latin, Armenian and Syriac versions of the Romance.<ref>Van Donzel, Emeri J., and Andrea Schmidt.

Almost immediately after his death in 323 BC a body of legend began to accumulate about his exploits and life which, over the centuries, became increasingly fantastic as well as allegorical. Collectively this tradition is called the ''Alexander romance'' and some [[recension]]s feature such vivid episodes as Alexander ascending through the air to [[Paradise]], journeying to the bottom of the sea in a glass bubble, and journeying through the [[Land of Darkness]] in search of the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] (Fountain of Youth).\n\nThe earliest [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts of the ''Alexander romance'', as they have survived, indicate that it was composed at [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century. The original text was lost but was the source of some eighty different versions written in twenty-four different languages.<ref>[[#McGinn1998|McGinn 1998]].</ref>  As the ''Alexander romance'' persisted in popularity over the centuries, it was assumed by various neighbouring people. Of particular significance was its incorporation into Jewish and later Christian legendary traditions. In the Jewish tradition Alexander was initially a figure of [[satire]], representing the vain or covetous ruler who is ignorant of larger spiritual truths. Yet their belief in a just, all-powerful God forced Jewish interpreters of the Alexander tradition to come to terms with Alexander's undeniable temporal success. Why would a just, all-powerful God show such favour to an unrighteous ruler? This [[Problem of evil|theological need]], plus acculturation to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], led to a more positive Jewish interpretation of the Alexander legacy. In its most neutral form this was typified by having Alexander show deference to either the Jewish people or the symbols of their faith. In having the great conqueror thus acknowledge the essential truth of the Jews' religious, intellectual, or ethical traditions, the prestige of Alexander was harnessed to the cause of Jewish [[ethnocentrism]]. Eventually Jewish writers would almost completely co-opt Alexander, depicting him as a [[Righteous among the Nations|righteous gentile]] or even a believing monotheist.<ref>[[#Jewish Encyclopedia|Broyd\u00e9 1906]].</ref>\n\nThe Christianized peoples of the [[Near East]], inheritors of both the Hellenic as well as Judaic strands of the ''Alexander romance'', further theologized Alexander until in some stories he was depicted as a [[saint]]. The Christian legends turned the ancient Greek conqueror Alexander III into Alexander ''\"the Believing King\"'', implying that he was a believer in monotheism. Eventually elements of the ''Alexander romance'' were combined with [[Biblical]] legends such as [[Gog and Magog]].\n\nDuring the period of history during which the ''Alexander romance'' was written, little was known about the true [[historical Alexander the Great]] as most of the history of his conquests had been preserved in the form of folklore and legends. It was not until the [[Renaissance]] (1300\u20131600 AD) that the true history of Alexander III was rediscovered:\n\n<blockquote>Since the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC there has been no age in history, whether in the West or in the East, in which his name and exploits have not been familiar. And yet not only have all contemporary records been lost but even the work based on those records though written some four and a half centuries after his death, the ''[[Anabasis Alexandri|Anabasis]]'' of [[Arrian]], was totally unknown to the writers of the Middle Ages and became available to Western scholarship only with the Revival of Learning [the Renaissance].  The perpetuation of Alexander's fame through so many ages and amongst so many peoples is due in the main to the innumerable recensions and transmogrifications of a work known as the ''Alexander Romance'' or ''Pseudo-Callisthenes''.<ref name=\"Boyle 1974\">[[#Boyle1974|Boyle 1974]].</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Dating and origins of the Alexander legends===\n[[File:Syriac Sert\u00e2 book script.jpg|thumb|250px|An 11th-century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[manuscript]].

Syriac  became the vehicle of [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christianity]] and culture, spreading throughout [[Asia]]. Before [[Arabic]] became the dominant language, Syriac was a major language among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christian communities of the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. Several Syriac manuscripts of the ''[[Alexander romance]]'' exist, dating from the 7th century. The [[:Category:Greek\u2013Syriac translators|Greek\u2013Syriac translators]] are generally credited with introducing the works of the ancient Greeks to pre-[[Islamic]] [[Arabia]].]]\nThe legendary Alexander material originated as early as the time of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] (305 BC to 30 BC)  and its unknown authors are sometimes referred to as the ''[[Pseudo-Callisthenes]]'' (not to be confused with [[Callisthenes of Olynthus]], who was Alexander's official historian). The earliest surviving manuscript of the ''Alexander romance'', called the \u03b1 ([[alpha]]) [[recension]], can be dated to the 3rd century AD and was written in [[Greek language|Greek]] in [[Alexandria]]:\n\n<blockquote>There have been many theories regarding the date and sources of this curious work [the ''Alexander romance'']. According to the most recent authority, ... it was compiled by a Greco-Egyptian writing in Alexandria about A.D. 300. The sources on which the anonymous author drew were twofold. On the one hand he made use of a `romanticized history of Alexander of a highly rhetorical type depending on the [[Cleitarchus]] tradition, and with this he amalgamated a collection of imaginary letters derived from an ''Epistolary Romance of Alexander'' written in the first century B.C. He also included two long letters from Alexander to his mother [[Olympias]] and his tutor [[Aristotle]]  describing his marvellous adventures in India and at the end of the World. These are the literary expression of a living popular tradition and as such are the most remarkable and interesting part of the work.<ref name=Brock1970/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Greek language|Greek]] variants of the ''Alexander romance'' continued to evolve until, in the 4th century, the Greek legend was translated into [[Latin]] by [[Julius Valerius Alexander Polemius]] (where it is called the ''[[Res gestae Alexandri Magni]]'') and from Latin it spread to all major [[vernacular]] languages of [[Europe]] in the Middle Ages. Around the same as its translation into Latin, the Greek text was also translated into the [[Syriac language]] and from Syriac it spread to eastern cultures and languages as far afield as China and Southeast Asia.<ref>HANAWAY, WILLIAM L. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama ESKANDAR-N\u0100MA]. Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica.</ref> The Syriac legend was the source of an [[Arabic]] variant called the ''Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn'' (''Tales of Dhul-Qarnayn'')<ref name=Zuwiyya2001>[[#Zuwiyya2001|Zuwiyya 2001]]</ref> and a [[Persian language|Persian]] variant  called the ''[[Iskandarnamah]]'' (''Book of Alexander''), as well as [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Ethiopic]] translations.<ref name=Zuwiyya2009>[[#Zuwiyya2009|Zuwiyya 2009]].</ref>\n\nThe version recorded in Syriac is of particular importance because it was current in the [[Middle East]] during the time of the Quran's writing and is regarded as being closely related to the [[literary]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] origins of the story of Dhul-Qarnayn in the Quran. The Syriac legend, as it has survived, consists of five distinct manuscripts, including a [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] religious legend concerning Alexander and a sermon about Alexander ascribed to the Syriac poet-theologian [[Jacob of Serugh]] (451\u2013521 AD, also called Mar Jacob), which according to Reinink was composed around 629\u2013636.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Reign of Heraclius: Crisis & Confrontation|last=Reinink |display-authors=etal |publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=35|quote=A syriac metrical homily ascribed to Jacob of Serug, the so called Alexanderlied, was composed between 629 - 636}}</ref> The Syriac Christian legend concentrates on Alexander's journey to the end of the World, where he constructs the ''[[Gates of Alexander]]'' to enclose the evil nations of ''[[Gog and Magog]]'', while the sermon describes his journey to the ''[[Land of Darkness]]'' to discover the ''[[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]'' (Fountain of Youth). These legends concerning Alexander are remarkably similar to the story of Dhul-Qarnayn found in the Quran.<ref name=stoneman2003>[[#Stoneman2003|Stoneman 2003]].</ref>\n\nOne of the five Syriac manuscripts, dated to the 18th century, has a version of the Syriac legend that has been  generally dated to between 629 AD and 636 AD. There is evidence in the legend of  \"''[[ex eventu]]'' knowledge of the [[Khazar]] invasion of [[Armenia]] in A.D. 629,\"<ref>[[#Czegledy1954|Czegl\u00e9dy 1954]].</ref><ref>[[#Czegledy1957|Czegl\u00e9dy 1957]].</ref> which suggests that the legend must have been burdened with additions by a [[redaction|redactor]] sometime around 629 AD.  The legend   appears to have been composed as [[propaganda]] in support of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (575\u2013641 AD) shortly after he defeated the Persians in the [[Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602\u2013628]]. It is notable that this manuscript fails to mention the Islamic conquest of [[Jerusalem]] in 636 AD by [[Muhammad]]'s (570\u2013632 AD) successor, [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] (590\u2013644 AD). This fact means that the legend might have been recorded before the \"cataclysmic event\"` that was the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]] and the resulting [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|surrender of Jerusalem]] in November 636 AD. That the [[Byzantine\u2013Arab Wars]] would have been referenced in the legend, had it been written after 636 AD, is supported by the fact that in 692 AD a Syriac Christian adaption of the ''Alexander romance'' called the ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'' was indeed written as a response to the Muslim invasions and was [[pseudepigraphy|falsely attributed]] to [[Methodius of Olympus|St Methodius]] (?\u2013311 AD); this ''Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius'' equated the evil nations of ''Gog and Magog'' with the Muslim invaders and shaped the [[eschatology|eschatological]] imagination of [[Christendom]] for centuries.<ref name=stoneman2003/>\n\nThe manuscripts also contain evidence of lost texts.

The combined [[deity]] Zeus-Ammon was a distinct figure in ancient Greek mythology. According to five historians of antiquity ([[Arrian]], [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], [[Diodorus]], [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], and [[Plutarch]]), Alexander visited the [[Oracle]] of Ammon at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] in the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] desert and rumours spread that the Oracle had revealed Alexander's father to be the [[deity]] Ammon, rather than Philip.<ref name=coin>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124716/coin/15880/From-the-Persian-Wars-to-Alexander-the-Great-490-336-bc|title=Coin: from the Persian Wars to Alexander the Great, 490\u2013336 bc|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>[[#Green2007|Green 2007]]. p.382</ref><ref name=plutarch>Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plut.+Caes.+27.1 ''Alexander'', 27]</ref> Alexander styled himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon and even demanded to be worshiped as a god:\n\n<blockquote>He seems to have become convinced of the reality of his own [[divinity]] and to have required its acceptance by others ...

Amongst the artifacts excavated at this site were four silver gilded [[phalera (military decoration)|phalera]] (ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] military medals). Two of the four medals are identical and depict the head of a bearded man with two horns, while the other two medals are also identical and depict the head of a clean-shaven man with two horns.

Volume 4, Number 1.</ref>\n\nAlexander has also been identified, since ancient times, with the horned figure in the [[Old Testament]] in the prophecy of [[Daniel 8]] who overthrows the kings of Media and Persia. In the prophecy, [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] has a vision of a ram with two long horns and verse 20 explains that ''\"The ram which thou sawest having two horns is the kings of [[Medes|Media]] and [[Persia]].\"'':\n\n<blockquote>[[Josephus]] [37\u2013100 AD], in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' xi, 8, 5 tells of a visit that Alexander is purported to have made to [[Jerusalem]], where he met the high priest Jaddua and the assembled Jews, and was shown the book of Daniel in which it was prophesied that some one of the Greeks would overthrow the empire of Persia. Alexander believed himself to be the one indicated, and was pleased. The pertinent passage in Daniel would seem to be VIII. 3\u20138 which tells of the overthrow of the two-horned ram by the one-horned goat, the one horn of the goat being broken in the encounter ...The interpretation of this is given further ...  \"The ram which thou sawest that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece.\" This identification is accepted by the church fathers ...<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Christian [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version of the ''Alexander romance,'' in the sermon by [[Jacob of Serugh]], describes Alexander as having been given horns of iron by God. The legend describes Alexander (as a Christian king) bowing himself in prayer, saying:\n\n<blockquote>O God ... I know in my mind that thou hast exalted me above all kings, and ''thou hast made me horns upon my head, wherewith I might thrust down the kingdoms of the world''...I will magnify thy name, O Lord, forever ... And if the Messiah, who is the Son of God [Jesus], comes in my days, I and my troops will worship Him...<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhile the ''Syriac Legend'' references the horns of Alexander, it consistently refers to the hero by his Greek name, not using a variant epithet.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing| isbn = 978-1-78673-131-9| last = Zadeh| first = Travis| title = Mapping Frontiers Across Medieval Islam: Geography, Translation and the 'Abbasid Empire| date = 28 February 2017|page=241}}</ref> The use of the Islamic epithet \"Dhu al-Qarnayn\", the \"two-horned\", first occurred in the Quran.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = University of Toronto Press| isbn = 978-1-4426-4466-3| last = Faustina Doufikar-Aerts| title = Alexander the Great in the Middle Ages: Transcultural Perspectives| chapter = Coptic Miniature Painting in the Arabic Alexander Romance| date = 2016|page=169}}</ref>\n\nIn Christian Alexander legends written in [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] (an ancient [[South Semitic]] language) between the 14th and the 16th century, Alexander the Great is always explicitly referred to using the [[epithet]] the \"Two Horned.\" A passage from the Ethiopic Christian legend describes the [[Angel of the Lord]] calling Alexander by this name:\n\n<blockquote>Then God, may He be blessed and exalted! put it into the heart of the Angel to call ''Alexander 'Two-horned,' '' ... And Alexander said unto him, ' ''Thou didst call me by the name Two-horned,'' but my name is Alexander ... and I thought that thou hadst cursed me by calling me by this name.' The angel spake unto him, saying, 'O man, I did not curse thee by ''the name by which thou and the works that thou doest are known.''

They represent him as a god, as a son of a god, as a prophet and propagandist of the Most High, as something approaching the role of a messiah, and also as the champion of Allah. They represent him as a world conqueror, who subjugated the two horns or ends of the world, the lands of the rising and of the setting sun ...<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\"/></blockquote>\n\nFor these reasons, among others, the Quran's Arabic epithet \"Dhul-Qarnayn,\" literally meaning \"the two-horned one,\" is interpreted as a reference to Alexander the Great.\n\n===Alexander's Wall===\n[[File:Iranischer Meister 001.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Iranian art|Persian]] painting from the 16th century illustrating the building of the wall with the help of the [[jinn]]]]\n\n====Early accounts of Alexander's Wall====\nThe  building of gates in the [[Caucasus Mountains]] by Alexander to repel the barbarian peoples identified with Gog and Magog has ancient provenance and the wall is  known as the [[Gates of Alexander]] or the [[Caspian Gates]]. The name Caspian Gates originally applied to the narrow region at the southeast corner of the [[Caspian Sea]], through which Alexander actually marched in the pursuit of [[Bessus]] in 329 BC, although he did not stop to fortify it. It was transferred to the passes through the Caucasus, on the other side of the Caspian, by the more fanciful historians of Alexander. The Jewish historian [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] (37\u2013100 AD) mentions that:\n\n<blockquote>...a nation of the Alans, whom we have previously mentioned elsewhere as being [[Scythians]] ... travelled through a passage which King Alexander [the Great] shut up with iron gates.<ref>''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'', VII, vii, Flavius Josephus</ref></blockquote>\n\nJosephus also records that the people of Magog, the Magogites, were synonymous with the Scythians.<ref>''[[The Antiquities of the Jews]]'', I, vi, Flavius Josephus</ref> According to Andrew Runni Anderson,<ref>[[#Anderson1932|Anderson 1932]].</ref> this merely indicates that the main elements of the story were already in place six centuries before the Quran's revelation, not that the story itself was known in the cohesive form apparent in the Quranic account. Similarly, [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] (347\u2013420 AD), in his ''Letter 77'', mentions that,\n\n<blockquote>The hordes of the Huns had poured forth all the way from [[Sea of Azov|Maeotis]] (they had their haunts between the icy [[Tanais]] and the rude [[Massagetae]], ''where the [[gates of Alexander]] keep back the wild peoples behind the Caucasus'').<ref>Letter 77 \"To Oceanus\", 8, Saint Jerome</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his Commentary on [[Ezekiel]] (38:2), Jerome identifies the nations located beyond the [[Caucasus mountains]] and near [[Sea of Azov|Lake Maeotis]] as Gog and Magog.  Thus the [[Gates of Alexander]] legend  was combined with the legend of [[Gog and Magog]] from the [[Book of Revelation]]. It has been suggested that the incorporation of the Gog and Magog legend into the ''Alexander romance'' was prompted by the [[Hunnic Empire#Early campaigns|invasion of the Huns]] across the [[Caucasus]] mountains in 395 AD into [[Armenia]] and [[Syria]].<ref>''Gog and Magog : Ezekiel 38-39 as pre-text for Revelation 19,17 and 20,7\u201310'', Sverre B\u00f8e, Mohr Siebec, 2001 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=vettpBoVOX4C&pg=PA223&lpg=PA223&dq=huns+caucasus+barrier+395&source=bl&ots=OzcMrWCevB&sig=YF72Rf6ypxYmGIySA3wsAbzftBc&hl=en&ei=eq_SSsG8C5PIlAex5_SoCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=huns%20caucasus%20barrier%20395&f=false see excerpt]) ({{ISBN|978-3-16-147520-7}})</ref>\n\n====Alexander's Wall in Christian legends====\n{{Main|Gates of Alexander}}\nChristian legends speak of the Caspian Gates (Gates of Alexander), also known as Alexander's wall, built by Alexander the Great in the [[Caucasus mountains]]. Several variations of the legend can be found. In the story, Alexander the Great built a gate of iron between two mountains, at the end of the [[flat Earth|Earth]], to prevent the armies of [[Gog and Magog]] from ravaging the plains. The Christian legend was written in [[Syria]] shortly before the Quran's writing and closely parallels the story of Dhul-Qarnayn.<ref>[[#Southgate1978|Southgate 1978]].</ref> The legend describes an [[apocryphal]] letter from Alexander to his mother, wherein he writes:\n\n<blockquote>I petitioned the exalted Deity, and he heard my prayer. And the exalted Deity commanded the two mountains and they moved and approached each other to a distance of twelve [[ell]]s, and there I made ... copper gates 12 ells broad, and 60 ells high, and smeared them over within and without with copper ... so that neither fire nor iron, nor any other means should be able to loosen the copper; ... Within these gates, I made another construction of stones ... And having done this I finished the construction by putting mixed tin and lead over the stones, and smearing .... over the whole, so that no one might be able to do anything against the gates. I called them the Caspian Gates. Twenty and two Kings did I shut up therein.<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThese [[pseudepigraphic]] letters from Alexander to his mother Olympias and his tutor Aristotle, describing his marvellous adventures at the end of the World, date back to the original Greek [[Alexander romance|recension \u03b1]] written in the 4th century in Alexandria. The letters are \"the literary expression of a living popular tradition\" that had been evolving for at least three centuries before the Quran was written.<ref name=\"Boyle 1974\"/>\n\n====Medieval accounts of Alexander's Wall====\n[[File:Derbent wall.jpg|thumb|200px|The wall of the citadel in [[Derbent]], Russia. Built by the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] kings, it was often identified with the \"[[Gates of Alexander]]\". The [[Caliph]] [[Umar]], as well as later Caliphs, sent expeditions to Derbent to seek out this wall.]]\n\nSeveral historical figures, both Muslim and Christian, searched for Alexander's Gate and several different identifications were made with actual walls. During the [[Middle Ages]], the Gates of Alexander story was included in travel literature such as the ''[[Travels of Marco Polo]]'' (1254\u20131324 AD) and the ''[[Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]''. The ''Alexander romance'' identified the Gates of Alexander, variously, with the [[Pass of Dariel]], the [[Derbent|Pass of Derbent]], the [[Great Wall of Gorgan]] and even the [[Great Wall of China]]. In the legend's original form, Alexander's Gates are located at the Pass of Dariel. In later versions of the Christian legends,  dated to around the time of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (575\u2013641 AD), the Gates are instead located in [[Derbent]], a city  situated on a narrow strip of land between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus mountains, where an ancient [[Sassanid]] fortification was mistakenly identified with the wall built by Alexander. In the ''[[Travels of Marco Polo]]'', the wall in Derbent is identified with the Gates of Alexander. The [[Gates of Alexander]] are most commonly identified with the [[Caspian Gates of Derbent]] whose thirty north-looking towers used to stretch for forty kilometres between the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains]], effectively blocking the passage across the Caucasus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Bretschneider1876|Bretschneider 1876]].</ref> Later historians would regard these legends as false:\n\n<blockquote>The gate itself had wandered from the Caspian Gates to the pass of Dariel, from the pass of Dariel to the pass of Derbend [Derbent], as well as to the far north; nay, it had travelled even as far as remote eastern or north-eastern Asia, gathering in strength and increasing in size as it went, and actually carrying the mountains of Caspia with it. Then, as the full light of modern day come on, the ''Alexander Romance'' ceased to be regarded as history, and with it Alexander's Gate passed into the realm of [[fairy]]land.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book |editor1-first= Andrew Runni |editor1-last= Anderson |title= Alexander's Gate, Gog and Magog, and the enclosed nations |date=January 1932  |publisher= [[Medieval Academy of America]] |location= [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |isbn= 978-0-910956-07-9}}\n</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the Muslim world, several expeditions were undertaken to try to find and study Alexanders's wall, specifically the [[Caspian Gates of Derbent]]. An early expedition to  Derbent was ordered by the Caliph [[Umar]] (586\u2013644 AD) himself, during the [[Arab conquest of Armenia]] where they heard about Alexander's Wall in Derbent from the conquered Christian Armenians. Umar's expedition was recorded by the renowned [[tafsir|exegetes of the Quran]], [[Al-Tabarani]] (873\u2013970 AD) and [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301\u20131373 AD), and by the Muslim geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] (1179\u20131229 AD):\n\n<blockquote>... [[Umar]] sent ... in 22 A.H. [643 AD] ... an expedition to Derbent [Russia] ... `Abdur Rahman bin Rabi`ah [was appointed] as the chief of his vanguard. When 'Abdur Rehman entered [[Eastern Armenia|Armenia]], the ruler Shehrbaz surrendered without fighting. Then when `Abdur Rehman wanted to advance towards Derbent, Shehrbaz [ruler of Armenia] informed him that he had already gathered full information about the wall built by Dhul-Qarnain, through a man, who could supply all the necessary details ...<ref name=\"Tabari\">[[Tafsir al-Tabari]], Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Vol. III, pp. 235\u2013239</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwo hundred years later, the [[Abbasid]] Caliph [[Al-Wathiq]] (?\u2013847 AD) dispatched an expedition to study the wall of Dhul-Qarnain in Derbent, Russia. The expedition was led by [[Sallam-ul-Tarjuman]], whose observations were recorded by [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] and by [[Ibn Kathir]]:\n\n<blockquote>...this expedition reached ... the Caspian territory. From there they arrived at Derbent and saw the wall [of Dhul-Qarnayn].<ref name=\"al-Hamawi\">Mu'jam-ul-Buldan, Yaqut al-Hamawi</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe Muslim geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] further confirmed the same view in a number of places in his book on geography; for instance under the heading \"Khazar\" (Caspian) he writes:\n\n<blockquote>This territory adjoins the Wall of Dhul-Qarnain just behind Bab-ul-Abwab, which is also called Derbent.<ref name=\"al-Hamawi\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] (763 \u2013 809 AD) even spent some time living in Derbent.  Not all Muslim travellers and scholars, however, associated Dhul-Qarnayn's wall with the Caspian Gates of Derbent. For example, the Muslim explorer [[Ibn Battuta]] (1304\u20131369 AD) travelled to China on order of the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] and he comments in his travel log that \"Between it [the city of [[Quanzhou|Zaitun]] in [[Fujian]]] and the rampart of Yajuj and Majuj [Gog and Magog] is sixty days' travel.\"<ref name=\"F.

In Islamic [[eschatology]], before the Day of Judgement Gog and Magog will destroy this gate, allowing them to ravage the Earth, as it is described in the Quran:\n\n:Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose [from their barrier], and they swiftly swarm from every mound.  And the true promise [Day of Resurrection] shall draw near [of fulfilment]. Then [when mankind is resurrected from their graves], you shall see the eyes of the disbelievers fixedly stare in horror.  [They will say,] \u2018Woe to us!  We were indeed heedless of this; nay, but we were wrongdoers.\u2019 (Quran 21:96\u201397. Note that the phrases in square brackets are not in the Arabic original.)\n\n====Gog and Magog in Christian legends====\n[[File:Radkarte MKL1888.png|thumb|200px|Example of a [[T and O map|T-O map]] appearing in a German encyclopedia published by [[Joseph Meyer (publisher)|Joseph Meyer]] (1796-1856 AD). The T-O map was the first printed map in Europe. The map shows a disc shaped Earth surrounded by [[Oceanus]], with the location [[Gog and Magog]] to the north, and [[Paropamisadae]] mountains ([[Hindu Kush]]) to the east in Asia. In the Christian legends, Alexander built the wall against Gog and Magog in the north, near the Caspian sea, and then went to the ends of the earth at the Paropamisadae, where it was supposed that the sun rises.]]\n\nIn the Syriac Christian legends, Alexander the Great encloses the Gog and Magog horde behind a mighty gate between two mountains, preventing Gog and Magog from invading the Earth. In addition, it is written in the Christian legend that in the [[end time]]s God will cause the Gate of Gog and Magog to be destroyed, allowing the Gog and Magog horde to ravage the Earth;\n\n<blockquote>The Lord spake by the hand of the angel, [saying] ...The gate of the north shall be opened on the day of the end of the world, and on that day shall evil go forth on the wicked ... The earth shall quake and this door [gate] which thou [Alexander] hast made be opened ... and anger with fierce wrath shall rise up on mankind and the earth ... shall be laid waste ... And the nations that is within this gate shall be roused up, and also the host of Agog and the peoples of Magog [Gog and Magog] shall be gathered together. These peoples, the fiercest of all creatures.<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThe Christian Syriac legend describes a [[flat Earth]] orbited by the [[sun]] and surrounded by the [[Paropamisadae]] (Hindu Kush) mountains. The Paropamisadae mountains are  in turn surrounded by a narrow tract of land which is followed by a treacherous Ocean sea called [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]]. It is within this tract of land between the [[Paropamisadae]] mountains and [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]] that Alexander encloses Gog and Magog, so that they could not cross the mountains and invade the Earth. The legend describes \"the old wise men\" explaining this [[geography]] and [[cosmology]] of the Earth to Alexander, and then Alexander setting out to enclose Gog and Magog behind a mighty gate between a narrow passage at the end of the flat Earth:\n\n<blockquote>The old men say, \"Look, my lord the king, and see a wonder, this mountain which God has set as a great boundary.\" King Alexander the son of Philip said, \"How far is the extent of this mountain?\" The old men say, \"Beyond India it extends in its appearance.\" The king said, \"How far does this side come?\" The old men say, \"Unto all the end of the earth.\" And wonder seized the great king at the council of the old men ... And he had it in his mind to make there a great gate. His mind was full of spiritual thoughts, while taking advice from the old men, the dwellers in the land. He looked at the mountain which encircled the whole world ... The king said, \"Where have the hosts [of Gog and Magog] come forth to plunder the land and all the world from of old?\" They show him a place in the middle of the mountains, a narrow pass which had been constructed by God ...<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\n[[Flat Earth#Early Christian Church|Flat Earth beliefs in the Early Christian Church]] varied and the Fathers of the Church shared different approaches. Those of them who were more close to [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]'s visions, like [[Origen]], shared peacefully the belief in a [[spherical Earth]]. A second tradition, including [[St Basil]] and [[St Augustine]], accepted the idea of the round Earth and the radial gravity, but in a critical way. In particular they pointed out a number of doubts about the [[antipodes]] and the physical reasons of the radial gravity. However, a flat Earth approach was more or less shared by all the Fathers coming from the Syriac area, who were more inclined to follow the letter of the [[Old Testament]]. [[Diodore of Tarsus]] (?\u2013390 AD), [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] (6th century), and [[Chrysostom]] (347\u2013407 AD) belonged to this flat Earth tradition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Leone Montagnini, \"La questione della forma della Terra.

A [[Georgian people|Georgian]] tradition, echoed in a chronicle, also identifies the Khazars with Gog and Magog, stating they are ''\"wild men with hideous faces and the manners of wild beasts, eaters of blood.\"''<ref>Schultze (1905), p. 23.{{Verify source|date=May 2009}}</ref>\n\nEarly Muslim scholars writing about Dhul-Qarnayn also associated Gog and Magog with the Khazars. [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301\u20131373 CE), the famous commentator of the Quran, identified Gog and Magog with the Khazars who lived between the Black and [[Caspian Sea]] in his work ''[[Al-Bidayah wa al-Nihayah]]'' (''The Beginning and the End'').<ref>[[Ibn Kathir]], ''Al-Bidayah wa'l-Nihayah (The Beginning and the End)''</ref><ref>Ibn Kathir, \"Stories of the Prophets\", page 54.

Fuat Sezgin, Frankfurt am Main, 1987</ref>\n\nThus Muslim scholars associated the Khazars with Dhul-Qarnayn just as the Christian legends associated the Khazars with Alexander the Great.\n\n===The rising place of the Sun===\n{{Primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}\nA peculiar aspect of the story of Dhul-Qarnayn, in the Quran, is that it describes Dhul-Qarnayn travelling to \"the rising place of the Sun\" and the \"setting place of the Sun,\" where he saw the Sun sets into a murky (or boiling) spring of water (or mud). Dhul-Qarnayn also finds a people living by the \"rising place of the Sun,\" and finds that these people somehow have \"no shelter.\"\n\nIn his commentary of the Quran, [[Ibn Kathir]]  (1301\u20131373 CE) explains that verse 18:89 is referring to the furthest point that could be travelled west:\n\n<blockquote>(Until, when he reached the setting place of the sun,) means, he followed a route until ''he reached the furthest point that could be reached in the direction of the sun's setting, which is the west of the earth.'' As for the idea of his reaching the place in the sky where the sun sets, this is something impossible, and the tales told by storytellers that he traveled so far to the west that the sun set behind him are not true at all. Most of these stories come from the myths of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] and the fabrications and lies of their heretics.<ref>Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah Al-Kahf 18:89, ''His traveling and reaching the Place where the Sun sets (the West)'' ([http://www.theholybook.org/content/view/7823/2/ link])</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn this commentary Ibn Kathir differentiates between the end of the Earth and the supposed \"place in the sky\" where the sun sets (the \"resting place\" of the sun. Ibn Kathir contends that Dhul-Qarnayn did reach the farthest place that could be travelled west but not the \"resting place\" of the sun and he goes on to mention that the [[People of the Book]] (Jews and Christians) tell myths about Dhul-Qarnayn travelling so far beyond the end of the Earth that the sun was \"behind him.\" This shows that Ibn Kathir was aware of the Christian legends and it suggests that Ibn Kathir considered Christian myths about Alexander to be referring to the same figure as the Dhul-Qarnayn mentioned in the Qu'an.\n\nA similar theme is elaborated upon in several places in the Islamic [[hadith]] literature, in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]:\n\n<blockquote>It is narrated ... that the Messenger of Allah one day said: Do you know where the sun goes? They replied: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Verily it (the sun) glides till it reaches its resting place under the Throne [of Allah]. Then it falls prostrate and remains there until it is asked: Rise up and go to the place whence you came, and it goes back and continues emerging out from its rising place...<ref>Sahih Muslim 1:297</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe setting place of the sun is also commented on by [[Al-Tabari]] (838-923 AD) and [[Al-Qurtubi]] (1214\u20131273 AD) and, like [[Ibn Kathir]], they showed some reservations towards the literal idea of the sun setting in a muddy spring but held to the basic theme of Dhul-Qarnayn reaching the ends of the Earth.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hockney|first1=Mike|title=World, Underworld, Overworld, Dreamworld|date=2014|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc.|isbn=9781326016579}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=June 2018}}\n\nThat the Earth must be spherical was known since at least the time of [[Pythagoras]] (570\u2013495 BC), but this knowledge did not reach ancient folklore such as the ''Alexander romance'' where Alexander travels to the ends of a flat Earth. It is notable that, unlike the Babylonians, Greeks, and Indians, the [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabs]] had no scientific astronomy. Their knowledge of astronomy was limited to measuring time based on empirical observations of the \"rising and setting\" of the sun, moon, and particular stars. This area of astronomical study was known as ''anwa'' and continued to be developed after [[Islamization]] by the Arabs.<ref name=\"Dallal\">Dallal, Ahmad (1999), \"Science, Medicine and Technology\", in Esposito, John, The Oxford History of Islam, Oxford University Press, New York, pg. 162</ref>  [[Astronomy in medieval Islam]] began in the 8th century and the first major Muslim work of astronomy was ''Zij al-Sindh'' written in 830 by [[Muhammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b|al-Khwarizmi]].  The work is significant as it introduced the [[Ptolemaic system]] into Islamic sciences (the Ptolemaic system was ultimately replaced by the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in Europe).\n\n====The rising place of the Sun in the Alexander legends====\n<div style=\"float:right\">\n{{Gallery\n|lines=15\n|File:Map homer world.jpg|Rendition of [[Homer]]'s view of the world (prior to 900 BC).

The Sun emerges from underneath the Earth, travelling along the fixed dome of the sky, and is shown rising from Oceanus.\n}}</div>\n\n<blockquote> The place of his [the Sun's] rising is over the sea, and the people who dwell there, when he is about to rise, flee away and hide themselves in the sea, that they be not burnt by his rays; and he passes through the midst of heaven to the place where he enters the window of heaven; and wherever he passes there are terrible mountains, and those who dwell there have caves hollowed out in the rocks, and as soon as they see the Sun passing [over them], men and birds flee away from before him and hide in the caves ... And when the Sun enters the window of heaven, he [it] straight away bows down and makes obeisance before God his Creator; and he travels and descends the whole night through the heavens, until at length he finds himself where he [the Sun] rises ... So the whole camp mounted, and Alexander and his troops went up between the fetid sea and the bright sea to the place where the Sun enters the window of heaven; for the Sun is the servant of the Lord, and neither by night nor by day does he cease from his travelling.<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThe Christian legend is much more detailed than the Quran's version and elaborates at length about the [[cosmology]] of the Earth that is implied by the story:\n\n<blockquote>He [Alexander] said to them [the nobles]:  \"This thought has arisen in my mind, and I am wondering what is the extent of the earth, and how high the heavens are ... and upon what the heavens are fixed ... Now this I desire to go and see, upon what the heavens rest, and what surrounds all creation.\" The nobles answered and said to the king, ... \"As to the thing, my lord, which thy majesty desires to go and see, namely, upon what the heaveans rest, and what surrounds the earth, the terrible seas which surround the world will not give thee a passage; because there are eleven bright seas, on which the ships of men sail, and beyond these there is about ten miles of dry land, and beyond these ten miles there is the foetid sea, [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]] (the Ocean), which surrounds all creation. Men are not able to come near to this foetid sea ... Its waters are like poison and if men swim therein, they die at once.\"<ref name=budge1889/></blockquote>\n\nThis ancient [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] of a legendary figure travelling to the end of Earth is also found in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], which can be dated to c. 2000 BC, making it one of the earliest known works of literary writing.<ref name=Markaz>Sattari J., \"A study on the epic of Gilgamesh and the legend of Alexander.\" Markaz Publications 2001 (In Persian)</ref> In the [[epic poem]], in tablet nine, Gilgamesh sets out on a quest for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] to seek immortality. Gilgamesh travels far to the east, to the mountain passes at the ends of the earth where he grapples and slays monstrous mountain lions, bears and others. Eventually he comes to the twin peaks of Mount Mashu at the end of the earth, from where the sun rises from the other world, the gate of which is guarded by two terrible scorpion-beings. They allow him to proceed through the gate after Gilgamesh convinces them to let him pass, stating his divinity and desperation, and he travels through the dark tunnel where the sun travels every night. Just before the sun is about to catch up with him, and with the North Wind and ice lashing him, he reaches the end. The world at the end of the tunnel is a bright wonderland full of trees with leaves of jewels. The 17th chapter of the apocryphal [[Book of Enoch]] describes a journey to the far west where the fire of the west receives every setting of the sun and a river of fire empties into the great western sea.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/boe020.htm |title = The Book of Enoch: Enoch's Journeys through the Earth and Sheol: Chapter XVII}}</ref> Chapters 72\u201380 describe the risings and settings of the sun through 12 portals of heaven in the east and west.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/boe075.htm |title = The Book of Enoch: The Book of the Courses of the Heavenly Luminaries: Chapter LXXII}}</ref> The myth of a flat Earth surrounded by an Ocean into which the sun sets is also found in the [[Iliad]], the famous epic poem written by [[Homer]] and dated to c. 900 BC.

He reported that in India the sun's heat is extremely intense in the morning, instead of noon being the hottest time of day. It has been argued that he based this on his belief that since India is located at the extreme east of a flat Earth, it would only be logical if the morning were unbearably hot due to the sun's proximity.<ref>How, Walter W. and Wells, J. A Commentary on Herodotus. Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1912. vol 1. p. 290.</ref>\n\n===Alexander's travels===\n[[File:Map-alexander-empire.png|thumb|right|Map of Alexander's travels. Alexander never marched far west of his native [[Macedon]] and his advances eastward ended at the fringes of India.]]\n\nThe Quran and the ''Alexander romance'' both have it that Dhul-Qarnayn (or Alexander) travelled a great deal. In the Quran's story of Dhul-Qarnayn, \"God gave him unto every thing a road\" (or more literally, \"We gave him the means of everything\" 18:84) He travels as far as the ends of the Earth, to the place on the Earth where the Sun sets (the west) and the place on the Earth where the Sun rises (the east). The Quran portrays him travelling to the \"setting of the sun.\" Muslim interpretations of these verses are varied, but classical Muslim scholars seemed to have been of the opinion that Dhul-Qarnayn's journey was real, not [[allegorical]], and that Dhul-Qarnayn's wall is also a real, physical wall somewhere on Earth.\n\nIn the Christian legends, Alexander travels to the places of the setting and rising of the Sun and this is meant to say that he travelled to the ends of the [[flat Earth]] and thus he had traversed the entire world. This legendary account served to convey the theme of Alexander's exploits as a great conqueror. Alexander was indeed a great conqueror, having ruled the largest empire in [[ancient history]] by the time he was 25 years old. However, the true historical extent of Alexander's travels are known to be greatly exaggerated in legends. For example, legend has it that upon reaching India,\n\n<blockquote>... said Alexander 'Truly, then, all the inhabited world is mine. West, north, east, south, there is nothing more for me to conquer.' Then he sat down and wept because there were not other worlds for him to conquer.<ref>[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=baldwin&book=thirty&story=alexander Thirty Most Famous Stories Retold], James Baldwin (1841\u20131925)</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn reality, while Alexander did travel a great deal, he did not travel further west than [[ancient Libya]] and did not travel further east than the fringes of India. According to historians, Alexander invaded India following his desire to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea.\" However, when he reached the [[Hyphasis River]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in 326 BC, his army nearly [[mutiny|mutinied]] and refused to march further east, exhausted by years of campaigning. Alexander's desire to reach \"the ends of the Earth\" was instilled by his tutor [[Aristotle]]:\n\n<blockquote>Alexander derived his concept of `Asia' from the teaching of Aristotle, for whom `the inhabited earth' was surrounded by `the Great sea' Ocean, and was divided into three areas \u2013 `Europe, Libya and Asia.' Thus the earth was not round but flat, and `Asia' was limited on the west by the [[Tanais]] (Don), the inland sea and the Nile, and on the east by `India' and `the Great Sea' ... he was mistaken in supposing that from the ridge of the [[Paropamisadae]] (Hindu Kush) one would see `the outer sea' and that `India' was a small peninsula running east into that sea.<ref>[[#Hammond1998|Hammond 1998]].</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis view of the world taught by Aristotle and followed by Alexander is apparent in Aristotle's ''[[Meteorologica]]'', a treatise on earth sciences where he discusses the \"length\" and \"width\" of \"the inhabited earth.\" However, Aristotle knew that the Earth is spherical and even provided observational proof of this fact. Aristotle's cosmological view was that the Earth is round but he prescribed to the notion of an \"inhabited Earth,\" surrounded by the Ocean, and an \"uninhabited Earth\" (though exactly how much of this was understood by his student Alexander the Great is not known).\n\n==Islamic depictions of Alexander the Great==\n\n===Arabic traditions===\n[[File:secret of secrets a.jpg|thumb|174px|right|Manuscript of the 9th-century Arabic work ''[[Secretum Secretorum]]'' (\"Secret of Secrets\"), an encyclopedic treatise on a wide range of topics including [[physiognomy]], [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[medicine]]. This work includes a series of supposed letters from [[Aristotle]], addressed to Alexander. The Arabic manuscript was translated into [[Latin]] in the 12th century and was influential in Europe during the [[High Middle Ages]] ]]\n\nAlexander the Great features prominently in early Arabic literature. There are many surviving versions of the ''Alexander romance'' in Arabic that were written after the conquest of Islam. It is also thought that pre-Islamic [[Arabic]] versions of the ''Alexander romance'' may have existed.<ref name=doufikar-aertis>Doufikar-Aerts, Faustina (2003). ''The Last Days of Alexander in an Arabic Popular Romance of Al-Iskandar.'' in ''The Ancient Novel and Beyond'' by Panayotakis, Zimmerman and Keulen.</ref>\n\nThe earliest surviving Arabic narrative of the Alexander romance was composed by [[Umara ibn Zayd]] (767\u2013815 AD). In the tale, Alexander travels a great deal, builds the Wall against Gog and Magog, searches for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] (Fountain of Youth), and encounters angels who give him a   \"wonder-stone\" that both weighs more than any other stone but is also as light as dust. This wonder-stone is meant to admonish Alexander for his ambitions and indicate that his lust for conquest and eternal life will not end until his death. The story of the wonder-stone is not found in the Syriac Christian legend, but is found in Jewish [[Talmudic]] traditions about Alexander as well as in Persian traditions.<ref name=stoneman2003/><ref>Southgate, Minoo.

In the Yemenite variation, Dhul-Qarnayn is identified with an ancient king of Yemen named [[Tubba']], rather than Alexander the Great, but the Arabic story still describes the story of Alexander's Wall against Gog and Magog and his quest for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]. The story also mentions that Dhul-Qarnayn (Tubba') visited a castle with glass walls and visited the [[Brahmins]] of India. The South Arabian legend was composed within the context of the division between the South Arabs and North Arabs that began with the [[Battle of Marj Rahit (684)|Battle of Marj Rahit]] in 684 AD and consolidated over two centuries.<ref name=stoneman2003/>\n\nThe ''Alexander romance'' also had an important influence on Arabic [[wisdom literature]]. In ''[[Secretum Secretorum]]'' (\"Secret of Secrets\", in Arabic ''Kitab sirr al-asrar''), an encyclopedic Arabic treatise on a wide range of topics such as [[Public administration|statecraft]], [[ethics]], [[physiognomy]], [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[medicine]], Alexander appears as a speaker and subject of wise sayings and as a correspondent with figures such as [[Aristotle]]. The origins of the treatise are uncertain. No [[Greek language|Greek]] original exists, though there are claims in the Arabic treatise that it was translated from the Greek into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and from Syriac into Arabic by a well-known 9th century translator, [[Yahya ibn al-Bitriq]] (?\u2013815 AD). It appears, however, that the treatise was actually composed originally in Arabic.\n\nIn another example of Arabic wisdom literature relating to Alexander, [[Ibn al-Nadim]] (?\u2013997 AD) refers to a work on [[divination]] titled ''The Drawing of Lots by Dhul-Qarnain'' and to a second work on divination by arrows titled ''The gift of Alexander'', but only the titles of these works have survived.\n\nNotably, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mu'tasim]] (794\u2013842 AD) had ordered the translation of the ''[[Thesaurus Alexandri]]'', a work on [[elixirs]] and [[amulets]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] into Arabic. The Greek work ''Thesaurus Alexandri'' was attributed to [[Hermes]] (the great messenger of the gods in [[Greek mythology]]) and similarly contained supposed letters from Aristotle addressed to Alexander.<ref name=stoneman2003/><ref>Yucesoy, Hayrettin. ''Messianic Beliefs & Imperial Politics in Medieval Islam: The Abbasid Caliphate in the Early Ninth Century''. 2009. University of South Carolina. pp. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nA more direct Arabic translation of the ''Alexander romance,'' called ''Sirat Al-Iskandar'', was discovered in [[Constantinople]], at the [[Hagia Sophia]], and is dated to the 13th century. This version includes the letter from Alexander to his mother about his travels in India and at the end of the World. It also includes features which occur exclusively in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version. The Arabic legend also retains certain [[pagan]] elements of the story, which are sometimes modified to suit the Islamic message:\n\n<blockquote>It is quite remarkable that some characteristics belonging to a pre-Islamic 'pagan' entourage, have survived in the text ... For example, Alexander orders an offering of sacrificial animals at the temple of [[Hercules]]. In the Arabic letter the name of the deity has been replaced by ''[[Allah]]'' ... Another passage in the account of the palace of Shoshan or Sus, gives a description of the large silver jars, which were alleged to have capacity of three hundred and sixty measures of wine. Alexander puts this assertion to the test, having one of the jars filled with wine and poured out for his soldiers during a banquet. This exact specification has been maintained, heedless of the Islamic ban on the use of wine ... These retouched borrowings are highly significant in this text, because the Arabic Alexander figure is portrayed as a propagator of Islamic monotheism.<ref name=doufikar-aertis/></blockquote>\n\nAnother piece of Arabic Alexander literature is the ''Laments (or Sayings) of the Philosophers''. These are a collection of remarks supposedly made by some philosophers gathered at the tomb of Alexander after his death. This legend was originally written in the 6th century in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and was later translated into [[Arabic]] and expanded upon. The ''Laments of the Philosophers'' eventually gained enormous popularity in Europe:<ref name=Brock1970/>\n\n<blockquote>[The 'Sayings of the Philosophers' are] remarks of the philosophers gathered at the tomb of Alexander, who utter a series of [[Apophthegmata Patrum|apophthegms]] on the theme of the brevity of life and the transience of human achievement ... a work entitled 'Sayings of the Philosophers' was first composed in Syriac in the sixth century; a longer Arabic version was composed by [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq|Hunayan Ibn Ishaq]] (809-973) the distinguished scholar-translator, and a still longer one by al-Mubashshir ibn Fatiq (who also wrote a book about Alexander) around 1053. Hunayan's version was translated into Spanish ... in the late thirteenth century.<ref>Hofmann, Heinz. ''Latin fiction: the Latin novel in context.'' Routledge, 1999. p.245</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Arabic ''Alexander romance'' also had an influence on a wider range of Arabic literature. It has been noted that some features of the Arabic Alexander legends found their way into ''[[Sinbad the Sailor|The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor]]'', a medieval story-cycle of Arabic origin. Sinbad, the hero of the epic, is a fictional [[sailor]] from [[Basrah]], living during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. During his voyages throughout the seas east of Africa and south of Asia, he has fantastic adventures going to magical places, meeting monsters, and encountering supernatural phenomena. As a separate example of this influence on Arabic literature, the legend of Alexander's search for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] is found in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', a collection of [[Middle East]]ern and [[South Asia]]n stories and [[Folklore|folktales]] compiled in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].<ref name=stoneman2003/>\n\n===Andalusian traditions===\n[[File:Poema de Yusuf.jpg|thumb|Manuscript of a 14th-century poem (''Poema de Yu\u00e7uf'') written in [[Aljamiado]] (Spanish and [[Mozarabic]] language [[transliterated]] in [[Arabic alphabet]]).]]\n\nAfter the [[Umayyad]] Muslim conquest of [[Al-Andalus]] (Spain) in 711 AD, Muslim literature flourished under the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] (929 to 1031 AD). An  [[Arabic]] derivative of the ''Alexander romance'' was produced, called ''Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn'' (''Tales of Dhul-Qarnayn'').<ref name=Zuwiyya2001/> The material was later incorporated into ''[[Qisas Al-Anbiya]]'' (''Tales of the Prophets''):\n\n<blockquote>By the turn of the first millennium C.E., the romance of Alexander in Arabic had a core centered on the Greek legendary material ... Interwoven later into this narrative in the ''Tales of the Prophets'' literature were episodes of an apparent Arab-Islamic elaboration: the construction of a great barrier to keep the people of Gog and Magog from harassing the people of the civilized world until Judgement Day, the voyage to the end of the Earth to witness the sun set in a pool of boiling mud, and Dhu al-Qarnayn's expedition into the [[Land of Darkness]] in search of the [[Fountain of Youth|Fountain of Life]] accompanied by his companion [[Al-Khidir|Khidir]] (\"the Green-One\").<ref name=Zuwiyya2009/></blockquote>\n\nBy 1236 AD, the [[Reconquista]] was essentially completed and Europeans had retaken the [[Iberian peninsula]] from the Muslims, but the [[Emirate of Granada]], a small Muslim vassal of the Christian [[Kingdom of Castile]], remained in Spain until 1492 AD. During the Reconquista, Muslims were forced to either convert to [[Catholicism]] or leave the peninsula. The descendants of Muslims who converted to Christianity were called the [[Morisco]]s (meaning \"[[Moors|Moor]]-like\") and were suspecting of secretly practicing Islam. The Moriscos used a language called [[Aljamiado]], which was a dialect of the Spanish language ([[Mozarabic]]) but was written using the [[Arabic alphabet]]. Aljamiado played a very important role in preserving Islam and the Arabic language in the life of the Moriscos; prayers and the sayings of Muhammad were translated into Aljamiado transcriptions of the Spanish language, while keeping all Quranic verses in the original Arabic. During this period, a version of the Alexander legend was written in the Aljamaido language, building on the Arabic ''Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn'' legends as well as [[Romance language]] versions of the ''Alexander romance''.<ref>Zuwiyya, David Z. \"Translation and the Arat of Recreation: The legend of Alexander the Great from the ''Pseudo-Callisthenes'' to the Aljamiado-Morisco ''Rrekontamiento del rrey Alisandre''\" in ''Sensus de sensu: Estudios filol\u00f3gicos de traducci\u00f3n''.

For example, Pseudo-Callisthenes is the source of many incidents in the ''[[Shahnama]]'' written by [[Ferdowsi]] (935\u20131020 AD) in [[New Persian]]. Persian sources on the Alexander legend devised a mythical genealogy for him whereby his mother was a concubine of [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]], making him the half-brother of the last Achaemenid [[shah]], [[Darius III of Persia|Darius]]. By the 12th century such important writers as [[Nizami Ganjavi]] (from [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Azerbaijan]]) were making him the subject of their [[Epic poetry|epic poems]]. The Muslim traditions also elaborated the legend that Alexander the Great had been the companion of [[Aristotle]] and the direct student of [[Plato]].\n\nThere is also evidence that the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translation of the ''Alexander romance'', dating to the 6th century, was not directly based on the Greek recensions but was based on a lost  [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] (pre-Islamic Persian) manuscript.<ref name=doufikar-aertis/>\n\n===Central Asian traditions===\n\nCertain Muslim people of [[Central Asia]], specifically [[Bulgars|Bulgar]], [[Tatar]] and [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] peoples of the [[Volga]]-[[Ural (region)|Ural]] region (within what is today [[Tatarstan]] in the [[Russian Federation]]), carried on a rich tradition of the Alexander legend well into the 19th century. The region was conquered by the [[Abbasid]] Caliphate in the early 10th century. In these legends, Alexander is referred to as ''[[Alexander III of Macedon|Iskandar]] Dhul-Qarnayn'' (Alexander the Two Horned), and is \"depicted as founder of local cities and an ancestor of local figures.\" The local folklore about ''Iskandar Dhul-Qarnayn'' played in an important role in communal identity:\n\n<blockquote>The conversion of the [[Volga Bulghars]] to Islam is commonly dated to the first decades of the 10th century, and by the middle of the 12th century, it is apparent that Islamic historical figures and Islamic forms of communal validation had become important factors for Bulghar communal and political cohesion. The [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] traveler Ab\u016b Hamid al-Gharn\u0101ti who visited Bulghar in the 1150s, noted that Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn passed through Bulghar, that is, the [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga-Kama]] region, on his way to build the iron walls that contained Y\u0101'j\u016bj and M\u0101'j\u016bj [Gog and Magog] within the [[land of darkness]] ... while Najib al-Hamad\u0101ni reports that the rulers of Bulghar claimed descent from Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn.<ref name=frank>{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=Allen J. |year=2000 |title=Historical Legends of the Volga-Ural Muslims concerning Alexander the Great, the City of Yelabuga, and B\u0101chm\u0101n Kh\u0101n |journal= Revue des mondes musulmans et de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e |volume=89-90 |issue=89\u201390 |pages=89\u2013107 |doi=10.4000/remmm.274|doi-access=free }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ''Iskandar Dhul-Qanryan'' legends played an important role in the conversion narrative of the Volga Bulgar Muslims:\n\n<blockquote>There are numerous digressions dealing with the founding of the Bulghar conversion narrative, and legends concerning Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn [Alexander Dhul-Qarnayn]  and [[Socrates]]. According to the account, Socrates was born a Christian in [[Samarqand]] and went to Greece to serve Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn (Iskandar R\u016bmi). Together, they went to the [[Land of Darkness]] (diy\u0101r-i zulmat) to seek the [[Fountain of Youth]] (\u0101b-i hay\u0101t). In the northern lands they built a city and called it Bulghar.<ref name=frank/> </blockquote>\n\nIn 1577 AD the [[Tsardom of Russia]] annexed control of the region and Bulgar Muslim writings concerning Dhul-Qarnayn do not appear again until the 18th and 19th centuries, which saw a resurgence of local ''Iskandar Dhul-Qarnayn'' legends as a source of Muslim and ethnic identity:\n\n<blockquote>It was only at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries that we begin to see historical legends concerning Iskandar Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn reemerge among [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga-Kama]] Muslims, at least in written form, and it was not until the 19th century that such legends were recorded from local Muslim oral tradition. In one of his earliest historical works, entitled Ghil\u0101lat al-Zam\u0101n and written in 1877 the Tatar theologian, Shih\u0101b al-D\u012bn Marj\u0101n\u012b wrote that according to Arabic and other Muslim writings, as well as according to popular legends, the city of Bulghar was founded by Alexander the Great.<ref name=frank/> </blockquote>\n\n== Orientalist and western views ==\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] studying the Quran began researching the identity of Dhul-Qarnayn. Theodor N\u00f6ldeke, believed that Dhul-Qarnayn was none other than Alexander the Great as mentioned in versions of the ''Alexander romance'' and related literature in Syriac (a dialect of [[Aramaic|Middle Aramaic]]).<ref>[[#Noldeke|N\u00f6ldeke]].</ref> The Syriac manuscripts were translated into English in 1889 by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]].<ref name=budge1889>[[#Budge1889|Budge 1889]].</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century [[Andrew Runni Anderson]] wrote a series of articles on the question in the ''Transactions of the [[American Philological Association]]''.<ref name=\"Anderson 1927\">[[#Anderson1927|Anderson 1927]].</ref> The findings of the [[philologists]] imply that the source of the Quran's story of Dhul-Qarnayn is the ''Alexander romance'', a thoroughly embellished compilation of Alexander's exploits from [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and early [[Christianity|Christian]] sources, which underwent numerous expansions and revisions for two-thousand years, throughout [[ancient history|Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"Edwards 2002\"/>\n\nAs can be seen in the following quotation from Edwards, secular [[philologists]] studying ancient [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] [[legend]]s about Alexander the Great also came to the conclusion that Dhul-Qarnayn is an ancient [[epithet]] for Alexander the Great. Edwards says, <blockquote>Alexander's association with two horns and with the building of the gate against Gog and Magog occurs much earlier than the Quran and persists in the beliefs of all three of these religions [Judaism, Christianity and Islam]. The denial of Alexander's identity as Dhul-Qarnain is the denial of a common heritage shared by the cultures which shape the modern world\u2014both in the east and the west. The popularity of the legend of Alexander the Great proves that these cultures share a history which suggests that perhaps they are not so different after all.<ref name=\"Edwards 2002\">[[#Edwards2002|Edwards 2002]].</ref></blockquote>Although modern academics have found that the oldest Alexander romance does not contain the episode where Alexander build the gates against Gog and Magog,<blockquote>The Syriac tradition is one of the most interesting versions of the many existing oriental redactions of the Romance. It dates from the 7th century and goes back on a quite similar Vorlage of the Greek recensio vetusta (n).4 The Syrian redactor, probably an East Syrian Christian, added a certain number of until then unknown episodes to the text. The episode of Alexander's building a wall against Gog and Magog, however, is not found in the oldest Greek, Latin, Armenian and Syriac versions of the Romance.<ref>Van Donzel, Emeri J., and Andrea Schmidt.

He was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Hitler]]'s [[National Socialism]], and in 1932 he published the antisemitic newspaper \"Der St\u00fcrmer\" in [[Timi\u0219oara]], an imitation of the German [[Nazi]] publication.

Karl von M\u00f6ller's grandfather volunteered in the [[German Campaign of 1813|Wars of Liberation]] and was disarmed in [[Sibiu]] (Transylvania). His father came to Vienna from Sibiu. Karl von M\u00f6ller was born in Vienna, where he attended the cadet school and the war school after high school. During the First World War, he moved as a major and chief of staff of the 34th Infantry Division, Banater Division, first to the Serbian and then to the Galician front. Von M\u00f6ller led from 1916 as a lieutenant colonel and later as colonel Hungarian Infantry Regiment No. 65 on the Eastern Front. He was awarded the [[Order of Leopold]].\n\n==Military career==\n\nAfter graduating from cadet school and from the Military Academy in [[Vienna]], he was appointed as a senior state officer{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and served in several garrisons.
