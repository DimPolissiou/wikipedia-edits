Her father, [[Gorazd Sotler]], was a sculptor, a pupil of the prominent Croatian sculptor [[Antun Augustin\u010di\u0107|Antun Augustin\u010di\u010d]] and her mother worked for Slovenia's leading newspaper and printing company, [[Delo (newspaper)|Delo]]. Alenka received her first informal training in drawing and sculpture in her father's studio. She studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana (1976\u20131981) and successfully finished her postgraduate study in painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana in 1983. From 1988, she works as freelance painter/ illustrator for the best Slovene and foreign publishers and magazines, including Mladinska knjiga, the largest and leading Slovene publisher. In 2011, she was awarded the title of Assistant Professor of Painting by the University of Ljubljana.\n\nShe has illustrated more than 50 books and produced many illustrations for children's magazines. An important part of her output is devoted to fairytales, both modern ([[Oscar Wilde]], [[Svetlana Makarovi\u010d]]) and classic (Folk Tales from Around the World, [[Brothers Grimm]]). Her black-white illustrations for Folk Tales from Around the World signalled her mastery and a number of awards followed. Her work is inventive, visually appealing and drawn with faultless confidence. She is contemporary in style but also well-versed in the history of visual imagery and the imagery of power, meaning and clarity. In recent years she has mainly illustrated poetry and fairytales and made original graphics/engravings for collections of poems by [[Malcolm de Chazal]], and works on paper inspired by literature and poetry.\n\nToday, she lives and works in Ljubljana.\n\n==Awards==\n* 2016\n** Illustrators 58 Gold Medal, [[Society of Illustrators]], New York, USA\n* 2014\n** [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] nomination, Mexico City, Mexico\n* 2013\n** [[Pre\u0161eren Award]] (Small), Republic of Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia\n* 2012\n** Merit /3x3 Illustration ProShow No.9 / 3x3 The Magazine of Contemporary Illustration, New York, USA \n** [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] nomination, Denmark\n* 2011\n** \"Getting Inside The Outsider\", House of Illustration and The Folio Society's Inaugural Book Illustration Competition finalist, London, UK \n** The White Ravens for the book The Emperor and the Rose, [[Internationale Jugendbibliothek]], M\u00fcnchen, Germany\n* 2010\n** [[Hinko Smrekar Award]] at the 9th Slovenian Biennial of Illustration, Ljubljana, Slovenia \n** Merit at the 3x3 Magazine International Professional Show, New York, USA \n** Grand Prix at the 3rd Croatian Biennal of Illustration, Zagreb, Croatia \n** The [[Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award]] nomination, Stockholm, Sweden\n* 2008\n** International Board on Books for Young People ([[IBBY]]) Honour List, Denmark \n** Italija, Bologna, Award of Excellence, Bologna Book Fair, Italy \n** Hinko Smrekar Award at the 8th Slovenian Biennial of Illustration, Ljubljana, Slovenia\n* 2007\n** [[Levstik]] Award for Illustration, Ljubljana, Slovenia \n** Certificate of Merit for being selected for the 49th Annual Exhibition at the SI New York, USA \n** Golden Apple at the Biennial of Illustrations Bratislava 2007, Bratislava, Slovakia\n* 2006\n** Certificate of Merit for being selected for the 48th Annual Exhibition at the SI New York, USA \n** First Prize for illustration at the 6th Slovenian Biennial of Illustration in Slovenia \n** Award for the most beautiful book at the Slovenian Book Fair, Ljubljana, Slovenia\n* 2005\n** Award of Excellence for being selected in the Emperor's New Illustrations, [[Bologna Book Fair]], Italy \n** Certificate of Merit for being selected for the 47th Annual Exhibition at the SI New York, USA\n* 2002\n** First Prize for illustration at the 5th Slovenian Biennial of Illustration in Slovenia\n* 2001\n** Award of Excellence at the BEIJ01 \u2013 Biennial of European Illustration in Japan\n* 1999\n** Trojlistok Grand Prix of the Children's Jury at the Biennial of Illustrations Bratislava, Slovakia\n* 1993\n** [[Hinko Smrekar Award]] at the 1st Slovenian Biennial of Illustration in Slovenia\n* 1981\n** [[Pre\u0161ern Award]] for students, Ljubljana, Slovenia\n\n==Selected Illustrated Works==\n* ''Pesem za liro'' (Poem for Lyra), written by [[Bina \u0160tampe \u017dmavc]], 2016\n* ''Ljubim tvoj medeni srh'' (I Love Your Honey Shudder), written by [[Mateja Blaznik]], 2014\n* ''Za\u0161to se baka ljuti?'fg' (Why Is Granny Angry?), written by [[Lela B.

The 1958 result was helped by an alliance with [[Maurice Duplessis]]'s formidable provincial electoral machine. But by the [[1962 Canadian federal election|1962 election]], Duplessis had died and his ''[[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'' party was out of office and in disarray, and Diefenbaker's support in Quebec had evaporated.  The Mulroney-era resurgence also collapsed entirely when he retired from politics.\n\nThe ''[[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'' was formed for the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 election]] in the aftermath of the failure of the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]], and has won more seats in Quebec than the Liberals in every election it has run in. The number of seats won by the Bloc has declined in each successive election from 1993 to 1997 to 2000. The party has now had a resurgence due to the [[2004 Canadian sponsorship scandal|sponsorship scandal]] and the unpopularity of [[Jean Charest]]'s provincial [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] government, which influences support for the federal Liberals even though the two parties are independent of one another.\n\nPolls show the Bloc with a strong lead, and they may return to the number of seats they had in 1993.  However, the Liberals are likely to dominate in many parts of Montreal. Ridings where Anglophone voters are a significant factor are among the safest Liberal seats in all of Canada.\n\nThe other two major federal parties, the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) are not expected to win any seats and are struggling to move out of single digits in the polls.  The NDP in particular has historically never had any electoral success in Quebec up to that point.\n\n====Eastern Quebec====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Eastern Quebec}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-e}}\n\n====C\u00f4te-Nord and Saguenay====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the C\u00f4te-Nord and Saguenay}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-cn}}\n\n====Quebec City====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Quebec City}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-qc}}\n\n====Central Quebec====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Central Quebec}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-c}}\n\n====Eastern Townships====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the Eastern Townships}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-et}}\n\n====Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-mt}}\n\n====Eastern Montreal====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Eastern Montreal}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-me}}\n\n====Western Montreal====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Western Montreal}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-mw}}\n\n====Northern Montreal and Laval====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Northern Montreal and Laval}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-mn}}\n\n====Laurentides, Outaouais and Northern Quebec====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the Laurentides, Outaouais and Northern Quebec}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-lo}}\n\n===Ontario===\n[[Image:Flag of Ontario.svg|150px|left]] Ontario was predicted to be the battle ground of this election. Most pundits believed that this is where the election was lost for the Conservatives. Ontario is home to more than one third of all of Canada's ridings. In the last three elections, right wing vote splitting has resulted in just six riding losses for the Liberals, compared to 299 riding wins. However, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives have merged, and they should win many seats in Ontario, especially in rural ridings in midwestern Ontario, Central-eastern Ontario, and Central Ontario. The NDP has some support in various pockets in Ontario in the past, but has only won one riding in the last three elections, and one more in a by-election, both in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]]. However, the NDP was expected to do well not only in Windsor, but in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Downtown [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa Centre]], and possibly even in [[Northern Ontario]].\n\n====Ottawa====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Ottawa}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/on-o}}\n\n====Eastern Ontario====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Eastern Ontario}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/on-e}}\n\n====Central Ontario====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Central Ontario}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/on-c}}\n\n====Southern Durham and York====\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=80%|Profile & Notes\n!colspan=2|Electoral History\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke rowspan=8 valign=top|This sprawling and rapidly growing [[suburban]] area to the north and east of the City of [[Toronto]] encompasses the eastern portion of what Canadian political watchers in the early nineties dubbed the \"[[905 belt]]\"\u2014a swath of middle class suburban voters roughly corresponding to the same boundaries of the [[North American area code 905|905 Area Code]] that can be readily tipped from the Liberal to the Conservative column.  905's buy-in on the provincial level to [[Mike Harris]]'s [[Common Sense Revolution]] secured him two conservative majority governments, while its rejection of the Tories in 2002 paved the way for [[Dalton McGuinty]]'s landslide. 905 solidly supported the Chr\u00e9tien Liberals, but Conservatives hope that the absence of vote-splitting and rising national fortunes can lead to substantial pickups on election night.\n\n'''Notes:'''<small>\n<br />1 - [[Ivan Grose|Grose]] lost nomination\n<br />2 - [[Elinor Caplan|Caplan]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral;

Now that they have merged, the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] are targeting several ridings in the area in this election. In Hamilton, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democrats]] is looking for major gains as well. They held the seat of [[Hamilton Mountain]] twice. Traditionally, Liberal support has been concentrated in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Welland, Ontario|Welland]] and in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]].

Brant is where the NDP did will with popular MP [[Derek Blackburn]] from 1971 to 1993. However, the NDP have been unable to duplicate this success in this area, and are unlikely to do so. The Conservatives won every other seat except for three seats in 1979, 1980, 1984, and 1988 sweeping the area (except for Brant) in 1984 and 1979. The three seats that went Liberal were Guelph and Kitchener (1980) and Haldimand-Norfolk (1988). Since the collapse of the Conservatives, and vote splitting the Liberals swept this area in 1993, 1997 and 2000. However, with a united right, this is unlikely to be duplicated a fourth time.\n<br />'''Notes:''' \n<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Jane Stewart (politician)|Stewart]] not seeking re-election\n<br />2 -  [[John Baird Finlay|Finlay]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral;

The Liberals do well in the cities of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[London, Ontario|London]], and Conservatives do well in the rural areas of Kent County, Essex County, Lambton County, Elgin County, and Middlesex County. The NDP also has done well in the past, and currently in Windsor and London, where unions are strong. The NDP was elected in both Windsor-Walkerville and London-Fanshawe in 1984 and 1988, and hold both Windsor seats currently. The Liberas swept all but the riding of Elgin in 1980, the Conservatives swept all but the two Windsor ridings in 1984, and one London riding. The Liberals swept every single riding here in 1993 and 1997, and all but the riding of Windsor-St. Clair in 2000. \n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:lightcoral;

The Conservatives have only won a combined total of 9 seats in Northern Ontario since 1979, 4 of which in the very Conservative Parry Sound Muskoka. The NDP has consistently done well here, finishing either first or second, even if it means not winning seats. They are especially strong in Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Nickel Belt, and Sault Ste. Marie, but have also won seats in Kenora-Rainy River, Thunder Bay-Nipigon, and Timmins Chapleau. The only bad showing by the Liberals since 1979 came in 1984, where they still managed 3 of 12 seats winning in Algoma, Sudbury, and Cochrane despite a national Conservative landslide.\n<br />'''Notes:'''<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Bob Nault|Nault]] not seeking re-election\n<br />2 -  [[Bob Wood (Liberal)|Wood]] not seeking re-election\n<br />3 -  [[Stan Dromisky|Dromisky]] not seeking re-election\n<br />4 -  [[R\u00e9ginald B\u00e9lair|B\u00e9lair]] and [[Ben Serr\u00e9|Serr\u00e9]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown;

This is especially true in the city of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]] where most Manitobans live. However, due to vote splitting in recent elections, neither the Progressive Conservatives or the Canadian Alliance/Reform Party have been able to win in Winnipeg. In rural Manitoba, the Liberals are usually shut out of elections (exception in 1993). Conservative support is normally in the more populous south, with NDP support in the sparsely populated north, which usually only means one seat.\n\n====Rural Manitoba====\n  {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=100%|Profile & Notes\n!colspan=2|Electoral History\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke rowspan=8 valign=top|\n\nRural Manitoba is traditionally very Conservative, sith some NDP leanings.  Vote splitting only effected this area in 1993, when the Liberals nearly swept the region, winning all but one seat. In 1997 they could keep one. The Progressive Conservatives did their best here, out of all of western Canada, winning the riding of Brandon-Souris in both 1997 and 2000. The NDP's strength lies in the riding of [[Churchill (electoral district)|Churchill]], in northern Manitoba where they have consistently won in.\n\n'''Notes:'''<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Rick Borotsik|Borotsik]] not seeking re-election\n<br />2 -  [[Howard Hilstrom|Hilstrom]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown;

Traditionally, Saskatchewan has been a two-way race between the Conservatives, and later the Reform/Alliance and the NDP. Recent vote splitting has allowed the Liberals to come through and win a few seats in this polarized province. Urban Saskatchewan has tended to vote NDP and rural Saskatchewan has tended to vote Conservative. This is especially true in provincial politics, where riding boundaries more reflect the urban/rural divide. Both Saskatoon and Regina, Saskatchewans largest cities are split into 4 ridings each. All eight of these ridings are generally split evenly between rural and urban.

You need only look at the results of the ridings here in the last century to prove this. Alberta has long been a Progressive Conservative province, but with the collapse of the party in 1993, Albertans went to the Reform Party of Canada (later the Canadian Alliance) for their vote. Edmonton seems to be the only exception to this. The Liberals have won in Edmonton six times since 1993, and the NDP has won in Edmonton as well.\n\n====Rural Alberta====\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=100%|Profile & Notes\n!colspan=2|Electoral History\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke rowspan=8 valign=top|This region is unarguably the most Conservative region in Canada.

The two Liberal incumbents are both in close races, and the new Conservative Party of Canada could possibly sweep Edmonton, and therefore all of Alberta. \n<br />'''Notes:'''\n<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Deborah Grey|Grey]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:cornflowerblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''2004'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:cadetblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[2000 Canadian federal election|2000]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:mediumseagreen; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1997 Canadian federal election|1997]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:mediumseagreen; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span> \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1993 Canadian federal election|1993]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown; font-size:135%;\">\u2022</span><span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span> \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1988 Canadian federal election|1988]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>  \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1984 Canadian federal election|1984]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>   \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1980 Canadian federal election|1980]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1979 Canadian federal election|1979]]'''\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=16% rowspan=2|Electoral District\n!colspan=5|Candidates\n!width=14% rowspan=2|Incumbent\n|-\n!width=14% bgcolor=lightcoral|<br />[[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=cornflowerblue|<br />[[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=sandybrown|<br />[[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democrats]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=yellowgreen|<br />[[Green Party of Canada|Green]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=gainsboro|Other\t\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke|[[Edmonton\u2014Beaumont]]\n|bgcolor=lightcoral|[[David Kilgour]] <br /> 17,555\n|[[Tim Uppal]] <br /> 17,421\n|Paul Reikie <br /> 3,975\n|Michael Garfinkle <br /> 1,911\n|[[Naomi Rankin]] (Comm.) <br /> 135\n|bgcolor=lightcoral|David Kilgour\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke|[[Edmonton Centre]]\n|bgcolor=lightcoral|'''[[Anne McLellan]]''' <br /> 22,560\n|[[Laurie Hawn]] <br /> 21,839\n|Meghan McMaster <br /> 4,836\n|[[David J.

British Columbia has a history of voting against the government. This has meant the NDP in the 1980s and the Reform/Canadian Alliance in the 1990s. More recently, regional trends have started to appear in B.C. The interior votes very Conservative, as the Canadian Alliance swept this area in 2000. B.C. has in the past been a province that would swing from one extreme to the other going for the right wing Social Credit to the left wing NDP in the past, in not only federal elections but provincial elections. The NDP also does well in British Columbia, or at least has in the past. Recently, they have been reduced to seats in the Vancouver area. There is hope that they will return to more traditional NDP seats on Vancouver Island, and in the interior. The Liberals have also won a few seats in B.C. recently, an area they have traditionally done very poor. Their strengths are in Victoria and in Vancouver.\n\n====Interior B.C.====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the British Columbia Interior}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/bc-in}}\n\n====Fraser Valley and Southern Lower Mainland====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the Fraser Valley and Southern Lower Mainland}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/bc-fv}}\n\n====Vancouver and Northern Lower Mainland====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Vancouver and the Northern Lower Mainland}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/bc-vn}}\n\n====Vancouver Island====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Vancouver Island}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/bc-vi}}\n\n===Nunavut===\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/nu}}\n\n===Northwest Territories===\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/nt}}\n\n===Yukon===\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/yk}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=ele&document=index&dir=38e/loc&lang=e&textonly=false Complete List of Official Candidates&mdash;Elections Canada]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090705085708/http://www.electionalmanac.com/canada/ Election Almanac - Canada Federal Election]\n* http://www.electionprediction.org/2004_fed/\n\n{{See also|list of Canada's electoral districts}}\n\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004A}}\n\n[[Category:2004 Canadian federal election]]\n", "text_old": "This is a seat by seat list of '''candidates in the 2004 Canadian election'''.\n\nFor more information about the election see [[2004 Canadian federal election]].\n\n==2004 federal redistribution==\nDue to the 2001 census, Canada's 301 electoral districts increased to 308 as of April 1, 2004.

The 1958 result was helped by an alliance with [[Maurice Duplessis]]'s formidable provincial electoral machine. But by the [[1962 Canadian federal election|1962 election]], Duplessis had died and his ''[[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'' party was out of office and in disarray, and Diefenbaker's support in Quebec had evaporated.  The Mulroney-era resurgence also collapsed entirely when he retired from politics.\n\nThe ''[[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'' was formed for the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 election]] in the aftermath of the failure of the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]], and has won more seats in Quebec than the Liberals in every election it has run in. The number of seats won by the Bloc has declined in each successive election from 1993 to 1997 to 2000. The party has now had a resurgence due to the [[2004 Canadian sponsorship scandal|sponsorship scandal]] and the unpopularity of [[Jean Charest]]'s provincial [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] government, which influences support for the federal Liberals even though the two parties are independent of one another.\n\nPolls show the Bloc with a strong lead, and they may return to the number of seats they had in 1993.  However, the Liberals are likely to dominate in many parts of Montreal. Ridings where Anglophone voters are a significant factor are among the safest Liberal seats in all of Canada.\n\nThe other two major federal parties, the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) are not expected to win any seats and are struggling to move out of single digits in the polls.  The NDP in particular has historically never had any electoral success in Quebec up to that point.\n\n====Eastern Quebec====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Eastern Quebec}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-e}}\n\n====C\u00f4te-Nord and Saguenay====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the C\u00f4te-Nord and Saguenay}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-cn}}\n\n====Quebec City====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Quebec City}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-qc}}\n\n====Central Quebec====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Central Quebec}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-c}}\n\n====Eastern Townships====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the Eastern Townships}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-et}}\n\n====Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-mt}}\n\n====Eastern Montreal====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Eastern Montreal}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-me}}\n\n====Western Montreal====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Western Montreal}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-mw}}\n\n====Northern Montreal and Laval====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Northern Montreal and Laval}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-mn}}\n\n====Laurentides, Outaouais and Northern Quebec====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the Laurentides, Outaouais and Northern Quebec}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-lo}}\n\n===Ontario===\n[[Image:Flag of Ontario.svg|150px|left]] Ontario was predicted to be the battle ground of this election. Most pundits believed that this is where the election was lost for the Conservatives. Ontario is home to more than one third of all of Canada's ridings. In the last three elections, right wing vote splitting has resulted in just six riding losses for the Liberals, compared to 299 riding wins. However, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives have merged, and they should win many seats in Ontario, especially in rural ridings in midwestern Ontario, Central-eastern Ontario, and Central Ontario. The NDP has some support in various pockets in Ontario in the past, but has only won one riding in the last three elections, and one more in a by-election, both in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]]. However, the NDP was expected to do well not only in Windsor, but in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Downtown [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa Centre]], and possibly even in [[Northern Ontario]].\n\n====Ottawa====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Ottawa}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/on-o}}\n\n====Eastern Ontario====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Eastern Ontario}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/on-e}}\n\n====Central Ontario====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Central Ontario}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/on-c}}\n\n====Southern Durham and York====\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=80%|Profile & Notes\n!colspan=2|Electoral History\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke rowspan=8 valign=top|This sprawling and rapidly growing [[suburban]] area to the north and east of the City of [[Toronto]] encompasses the eastern portion of what Canadian political watchers in the early nineties dubbed the \"[[905 belt]]\"\u2014a swath of middle class suburban voters roughly corresponding to the same boundaries of the [[North American area code 905|905 Area Code]] that can be readily tipped from the Liberal to the Conservative column.  905's buy-in on the provincial level to [[Mike Harris]]'s [[Common Sense Revolution]] secured him two conservative majority governments, while its rejection of the Tories in 2002 paved the way for [[Dalton McGuinty]]'s landslide. 905 solidly supported the Chr\u00e9tien Liberals, but Conservatives hope that the absence of vote-splitting and rising national fortunes can lead to substantial pickups on election night.\n\n'''Notes:'''<small>\n<br />1 - [[Ivan Grose|Grose]] lost nomination\n<br />2 - [[Elinor Caplan|Caplan]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral;

Brant is where the NDP did will with popular MP [[Derek Blackburn]] from 1971 to 1993. However, the NDP have been unable to duplicate this success in this area, and are unlikely to do so. The Conservatives won every other seat except for three seats in 1979, 1980, 1984, and 1988 sweeping the area (except for Brant) in 1984 and 1979. The three seats that went Liberal were Guelph and Kitchener (1980) and Haldimand-Norfolk (1988). Since the collapse of the Conservatives, and vote splitting the Liberals swept this area in 1993, 1997 and 2000. However, with a united right, this is unlikely to be duplicated a fourth time.\n<br />'''Notes:''' \n<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Jane Stewart (politician)|Stewart]] not seeking re-election\n<br />2 -  [[John Baird Finlay|Finlay]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral;

The Liberals do well in the cities of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[London, Ontario|London]], and Conservatives do well in the rural areas of Kent County, Essex County, Lambton County, Elgin County, and Middlesex County. The NDP also has done well in the past, and currently in Windsor and London, where unions are strong. The NDP was elected in both Windsor-Walkerville and London-Fanshawe in 1984 and 1988, and hold both Windsor seats currently. The Liberas swept all but the riding of Elgin in 1980, the Conservatives swept all but the two Windsor ridings in 1984, and one London riding. The Liberals swept every single riding here in 1993 and 1997, and all but the riding of Windsor-St. Clair in 2000. \n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:lightcoral;

The Conservatives have only won a combined total of 9 seats in Northern Ontario since 1979, 4 of which in the very Conservative Parry Sound Muskoka. The NDP has consistently done well here, finishing either first or second, even if it means not winning seats. They are especially strong in Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Nickel Belt, and Sault Ste. Marie, but have also won seats in Kenora-Rainy River, Thunder Bay-Nipigon, and Timmins Chapleau. The only bad showing by the Liberals since 1979 came in 1984, where they still managed 3 of 12 seats winning in Algoma, Sudbury, and Cochrane despite a national Conservative landslide.\n<br />'''Notes:'''<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Bob Nault|Nault]] not seeking re-election\n<br />2 -  [[Bob Wood (Liberal)|Wood]] not seeking re-election\n<br />3 -  [[Stan Dromisky|Dromisky]] not seeking re-election\n<br />4 -  [[R\u00e9ginald B\u00e9lair|B\u00e9lair]] and [[Ben Serr\u00e9|Serr\u00e9]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown;

This is especially true in the city of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]] where most Manitobans live. However, due to vote splitting in recent elections, neither the Progressive Conservatives or the Canadian Alliance/Reform Party have been able to win in Winnipeg. In rural Manitoba, the Liberals are usually shut out of elections (exception in 1993). Conservative support is normally in the more populous south, with NDP support in the sparsely populated north, which usually only means one seat.\n\n====Rural Manitoba====\n  {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=100%|Profile & Notes\n!colspan=2|Electoral History\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke rowspan=8 valign=top|\n\nRural Manitoba is traditionally very Conservative, sith some NDP leanings.  Vote splitting only effected this area in 1993, when the Liberals nearly swept the region, winning all but one seat. In 1997 they could keep one. The Progressive Conservatives did their best here, out of all of western Canada, winning the riding of Brandon-Souris in both 1997 and 2000. The NDP's strength lies in the riding of [[Churchill (electoral district)|Churchill]], in northern Manitoba where they have consistently won in.\n\n'''Notes:'''<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Rick Borotsik|Borotsik]] not seeking re-election\n<br />2 -  [[Howard Hilstrom|Hilstrom]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown;

Traditionally, Saskatchewan has been a two-way race between the Conservatives, and later the Reform/Alliance and the NDP. Recent vote splitting has allowed the Liberals to come through and win a few seats in this polarized province. Urban Saskatchewan has tended to vote NDP and rural Saskatchewan has tended to vote Conservative. This is especially true in provincial politics, where riding boundaries more reflect the urban/rural divide. Both Saskatoon and Regina, Saskatchewans largest cities are split into 4 ridings each. All eight of these ridings are generally split evenly between rural and urban. Northern Saskatchewan has in the past been the stand-alone region of rural Saskatchewan, usually voting for the NDP.\n\n====Southern Saskatchewan====\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=100%|Profile & Notes\n!colspan=2|Electoral History\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke rowspan=8 valign=top|\n\nSouthern Saskatchewan is traditionally split between the NDP and the Conservatives.

Much like the rest of Alberta, Edmonton usually always votes for the leading right wing party of the day. This is the one area of Alberta where the Liberals have been able to win anything in recent years, winning two seats in both 1997 and 2000, and four seats in 1993. The NDP have also won a seat in Edmonton, doing so in 1988. The two Liberal incumbents are both in close races, and the new Conservative Party of Canada could possibly sweep Edmonton, and therefore all of Alberta. \n<br />'''Notes:'''\n<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Deborah Grey|Grey]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:cornflowerblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''2004'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:cadetblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[2000 Canadian federal election|2000]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:mediumseagreen; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1997 Canadian federal election|1997]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:mediumseagreen; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span> \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1993 Canadian federal election|1993]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown; font-size:135%;\">\u2022</span><span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span> \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1988 Canadian federal election|1988]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>  \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1984 Canadian federal election|1984]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>   \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1980 Canadian federal election|1980]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1979 Canadian federal election|1979]]'''\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=16% rowspan=2|Electoral District\n!colspan=5|Candidates\n!width=14% rowspan=2|Incumbent\n|-\n!width=14% bgcolor=lightcoral|<br />[[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=cornflowerblue|<br />[[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=sandybrown|<br />[[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democrats]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=yellowgreen|<br />[[Green Party of Canada|Green]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=gainsboro|Other\t\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke|[[Edmonton\u2014Beaumont]]\n|bgcolor=lightcoral|[[David Kilgour]] <br /> 17,555\n|[[Tim Uppal]] <br /> 17,421\n|Paul Reikie <br /> 3,975\n|Michael Garfinkle <br /> 1,911\n|[[Naomi Rankin]] (Comm.) <br /> 135\n|bgcolor=lightcoral|David Kilgour\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke|[[Edmonton Centre]]\n|bgcolor=lightcoral|'''[[Anne McLellan]]''' <br /> 22,560\n|[[Laurie Hawn]] <br /> 21,839\n|Meghan McMaster <br /> 4,836\n|[[David J.

British Columbia has a history of voting against the government. This has meant the NDP in the 1980s and the Reform/Canadian Alliance in the 1990s. More recently, regional trends have started to appear in B.C. The interior votes very Conservative, as the Canadian Alliance swept this area in 2000. B.C. has in the past been a province that would swing from one extreme to the other going for the right wing Social Credit to the left wing NDP in the past, in not only federal elections but provincial elections. The NDP also does well in British Columbia, or at least has in the past. Recently, they have been reduced to seats in the Vancouver area. There is hope that they will return to more traditional NDP seats on Vancouver Island, and in the interior. The Liberals have also won a few seats in B.C. recently, an area they have traditionally done very poor. Their strengths are in Victoria and in Vancouver.\n\n====Interior B.C.====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the British Columbia Interior}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/bc-in}}\n\n====Fraser Valley and Southern Lower Mainland====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the Fraser Valley and Southern Lower Mainland}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/bc-fv}}\n\n====Vancouver and Northern Lower Mainland====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Vancouver and the Northern Lower Mainland}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/bc-vn}}\n\n====Vancouver Island====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Vancouver Island}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/bc-vi}}\n\n===Nunavut===\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/nu}}\n\n===Northwest Territories===\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/nt}}\n\n===Yukon===\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/yk}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=ele&document=index&dir=38e/loc&lang=e&textonly=false Complete List of Official Candidates&mdash;Elections Canada]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090705085708/http://www.electionalmanac.com/canada/ Election Almanac - Canada Federal Election]\n* http://www.electionprediction.org/2004_fed/\n\n{{See also|list of Canada's electoral districts}}\n\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004A}}\n\n[[Category:2004 Canadian federal election]]\n", "name_user": "WOSlinker", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix span tags", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_2004_Canadian_federal_election_by_riding"}

L\u00f3pez Obrador defined the first three transformations as the [[Mexican War of Independence]] (1810-1821), the [[Reform War]] (1858-1861) and the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910-1917).<ref name=\"que\">{{cite web|website=BBC News Mundo|title=AMLO presidente: \u00bfqu\u00e9 es la \"Cuarta Transformaci\u00f3n\" que propone Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador para M\u00e9xico?|date=Nov 26, 2018|accessdate=Jan 22, 2020|language=es|trans-title=AMLO president: What is the \"Fourth Transformation\" proposed by Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador for Mexico?|url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-45712329}}</ref>\n\nThe ''privileged abuses'' Lopez Obrador refers to have to do with high salaries and the luxurious enjoyed by high government officials in a country where half the population lives in poverty. AMLO wants to lower salaries for not only the [[President of Mexico|president]] but also [[Cabinet of Mexico|Cabinet]] members and high-level bureaucrats, justices of the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Supreme Court (SCJN)]], [[Congress of the Union|legislators]], and members of independent agencies such as the [[Instituto Nacional Electoral|electoral commission (INE)]] and the [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography|census office (INEGI)]]. In addition to salaries, AMLO mentions luxury vehicles including airplanes and helicopters; expensive private health insurance in addition to the [[Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers|program for government officials (ISSSTE)]]; expense accounts for bodyguards, gasoline, cell phones, and food; and a lack of transparency.<ref name=\"abusivos\">{{cite web|website=BBC News Mundo|title=M\u00e9xico: los \"abusivos\" privilegios en el gobierno que AMLO quiere eliminar con su plan de austeridad|author=Alberto N\u00e1jar|date=July 25, 2018|language=es|trans-title= Mexico: the \"abusive\" privileges in the government that AMLO wants to eliminate with its austerity plan|url= https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-44949439}}</ref>\n\n==Defining the Fourth Transformation==\n{{See also|Desafuero of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador}}\n{{quote|\"Based on what we have achieved, we will seek to undertake a peaceful and orderly transformation, yes, but no less profound than Independence, the Reformation, and the Revolution; we have not made all this effort for mere cosmetic changes, by far, and much less to stay with more of the same.\" \u2014 Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador<ref name=\"cuarta\">{{cite web |website=Naci\u00f3n 321 |title=\u00bfQu\u00e9 es la cuarta transformaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico que presume AMLO?|date=Dec 1, 2018|language=es|trans-title= What is the fourth transformation of Mexico that AMLO presumes?|url= https://www.nacion321.com/elecciones/que-es-la-cuarta-transformacion-de-mexico-que-presume-amlo}}</ref>}}\n\nIn a speech given at the end of his [[2018 Mexican general election|campaign for president]], Lopez Obrador spelled out what he means by the Fourth Transformation. He called for a nation of laws wherein nothing is outside the law and no one is above the law. He said the security services would be reformed so that no one was spied upon and religion, ideas, and the right to descent would be respected. AMLO called for a true democracy guaranteeing free elections and prison for electoral fraud. He called for an end of corruption and said the law should apply not only to government officials but also to their families. He said he would reform the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution]] so that even the [[Desafuero of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador|president could be prosecuted]] for corruption. He called for a [[popular consultation]] process after three years to determine whether the president should be recalled. He insisted that luxuries, such as high salaries for government officials, the presidential airplane and [[Los Pinos|official residence]], bodyguards, and presidential pensions should be cut or eliminated.<ref name=\"cuarta\"/>\n\nAMLO also called for increased attention to the needs of rural communities, revitalization of the construction industry, improvements in the energy sector, pensions for elderly Mexicans, free medicine, and improved education with access for all.<ref name=\"cuarta\"/>\n\n''[[Forbes|Forbes Mexico]],'' in a September 2018 article said that the Fourth Transformation presents an opportunity for Mexico to move forward as a true democracy. It could not depend on one political party and must move beyond campaign slogans. The authors, Nicola Morfini and Bernardo Sainz Mart\u00ednez of the [[Instituto Panamericano de Alta Direcci\u00f3n de Empresa|Pan American Institute for High Business Management (IPADE)]], argue that Mexico is at a crossroads: the large margin of victory by ''[[Juntos Haremos Historia]]'' in the 2018 election makes true change possible while also highlighting the possibility of regression. They warn that if decision-making depends exclusively on [[National Regeneration Movement|National Regeneration Movement (Morena)]], the legislature could lose power as it did under the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)]].

He called for a nation of laws wherein nothing is outside the law and no one is above the law. He said the security services would be reformed so that no one was spied upon and religion, ideas, and the right to descent would be respected. AMLO called for a true democracy guaranteeing free elections and prison for electoral fraud. He called for an end of corruption and said the law should apply not only to government officials but also to their families. He said he would reform the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution]] so that even the [[Desafuero of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador|president could be prosecuted]] for corruption. He called for a [[popular consultation]] process after three years to determine whether the president should be recalled.

The authors, Nicola Morfini and Bernardo Sainz Mart\u00ednez of the [[Instituto Panamericano de Alta Direcci\u00f3n de Empresa|Pan American Institute for High Business Management (IPADE)]], argue that Mexico is at a crossroads: the large margin of victory by ''[[Juntos Haremos Historia]]'' in the 2018 election makes true change possible while also highlighting the possibility of regression. They warn that if decision-making depends exclusively on [[National Regeneration Movement|National Regeneration Movement (Morena)]], the legislature could lose power as it did under the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)]]. Given the high poverty levels in the country, the authors suggest that popular democracy may be easily manipulated. They point out that many members of Morena were once members of PRI, which should have a moderating effect on political changes.

These influences, along with the liberal environment of [[Greenwich Village]], served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.\n\nVery few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s.

Police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, but officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn. Tensions between [[New York City Police Department|New York City police]] and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening, and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents quickly organized into activist groups to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gay men and lesbians to be open about their [[sexual orientation]] without fear of being arrested.\n\nAfter the Stonewall riots, gay men and lesbians in New York City faced gender, race, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gay men and lesbians. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world.

Gay men and lesbians were [[lavender scare|included]] in this list by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] on the theory that they were susceptible to [[blackmail]]. In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by [[Clyde R.

Cities performed \"sweeps\" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.<ref>Adam, p. 59.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] listed homosexuality in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (''DSM'') as a mental disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent\u2013child relationships.

[[Los Angeles]] area homosexuals created the [[Mattachine Society]] in 1950, in the home of communist activist [[Harry Hay]].<ref>Marcus, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist \"sexual deviants\" with legal troubles.<ref>Adam, pp. 62\u201363.</ref> Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gay men and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals.<ref>Adam, pp. 63\u201364.</ref><ref>Marcus, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Soon after, several women in [[San Francisco]] met in their living rooms to form the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB) for lesbians.<ref>Marcus, p. 21.</ref> Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine, and urged their members to assimilate into general society.<ref>Gallo, pp. 1\u20135, 11.</ref>\n\nOne of the first challenges to [[political repression|government repression]] came in 1953. An organization named [[ONE, Inc.]] published a magazine called ''ONE''. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexual people in heterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually [[One, Inc. v. Olesen|went to the Supreme Court]], which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.<ref>Marcus, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[Homophile]] organizations\u2014as homosexual groups self-identified in this era\u2014grew in number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. [[Frank Kameny]] founded the Mattachine of [[Washington, D.C.]] He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at [[mental health professional]]s, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal.<ref>Marcus, pp. 80\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn 1965, news on [[Cuba]]n prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine New York and D.C. to organize protests at the [[United Nations]] and the [[White House]].

A cohort of poets, later named the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]\u2014both Greenwich Village residents\u2014also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.<ref>Adam, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, a campaign to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]], who was concerned about the image of the city in preparation for the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]]. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.<ref>Carter, pp. 29\u201337.</ref> [[Entrapment]] usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together\u2014or the officer bought the man a drink\u2014he was arrested for [[solicitation]]. One story in the ''[[New York Post]]'' described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested.<ref>Carter, p. 46.</ref> Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.<ref>Duberman, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly-elected mayor [[John Lindsay]] to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City. They had a more difficult time with the [[Alcohol laws of New York|New York State Liquor Authority]] (SLA). While no laws prohibited serving homosexuals, courts allowed the SLA discretion in approving and revoking liquor licenses for businesses that might become \"disorderly\".<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/><ref>Carter, p. 48.</ref> Despite the high population of gay men and lesbians who called Greenwich Village home, very few places existed, other than bars, where they were able to congregate openly without being harassed or arrested. In 1966 the New York Mattachine held a \"sip-in\" at a Greenwich Village bar named [[Julius (New York City)|Julius]], which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the discrimination homosexuals faced.<ref>Jackson, Sharyn (June 17, 2008).

The legal drinking age was 18, and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called \"Lily Law\", \"Alice Blue Gown\", or \"Betty Badge\"<ref name=\"duberman187\">Duberman, p. 187.</ref>), visitors would have to be known by the doorman, or look gay. The entrance fee on weekends was $3, for which the customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for two drinks. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private \"bottle club\", but rarely signed their real names.<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or [[black light]]s.

We're taking the place!\"<ref name=\"Carter, p. 137.\">Carter, p. 137.</ref> Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.&nbsp;194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate.\n\nHistorian [[David Carter (historian)|David Carter]] presents information<ref>Carter, pp. 96\u2013103</ref> indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay [[Wall Street]] customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205&nbsp;people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered,\n\n<blockquote>\"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room in the back of the bar. [[Maria Ritter (person)|Maria Ritter]], then known as male to her family, recalled, \"My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!\"<ref name=\"carter142\">Carter, p. 142.</ref> Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by \"feeling some of them up inappropriately\" while frisking them.<ref>Carter, p. 141.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=30em | align=left |quote=When did you ever see a fag fight back?...

Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required to wait in line for about 15&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=\"carter142\"/> Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150&nbsp;people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: \"Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic.\"<ref>Teal, p. 2.</ref>\n\nWhen the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the crowd\u2014most of whom were homosexual\u2014had grown to at least ten times the number of people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet.<ref>Carter, p. 147.</ref> Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, \"Gay power!\", someone began singing \"[[We Shall Overcome]]\", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with \"growing and intensive hostility\".<ref>Carter, pp. 147\u2013148.</ref> An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo. Author [[Edmund White]], who had been passing by, recalled, \"Everyone's restless, angry, and high-spirited.

At least one was already bleeding when taken out of the bar (Carter, pp. 152\u2013153). Craig Rodwell (in Duberman, p. 197) claims the arrest of the woman was not the primary event that triggered the violence, but one of several simultaneous occurrences: \"there was just ... a flash of group\u2014of mass\u2014anger.\"</ref>), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, \"Why don't you guys do something?\" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon,<ref>Carter, p. 152.</ref> the crowd became a mob and went \"berserk\": \"It was at that moment that the scene became explosive.\"<ref>Carter, p. 151.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The night they busted Stonewall | author=Lucian K.

No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot, although one sarcastic account by a heterosexual publication suggested it. (Carter, p. 260.) Although [[Sylvia Rivera]] recalls she was saddened and amazed by the turnout at Garland's funeral on Friday, June 27, she said that she did not feel like going out much but changed her mind later. (Duberman, pp. 190\u2013191.) Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square, and said, \"When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing.\" (Deitcher, p. 72.)</ref> Michael Fader explained,\n\n<blockquote>We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around\u2014it's like standing your ground for the first time and in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away.

Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if he might have to use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt [[Charcoal lighter fluid|lighter fluid]] into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, [[siren (alarm)|sirens]] were heard and fire trucks arrived.

One officer's eye was cut, and a few others were bruised from being struck by flying debris. [[Bob Kohler]], who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive: \"I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over... The cops were totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because everybody else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill.\"<ref>Carter, p. 175.</ref> With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, \"Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon.\" His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, \"All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously.\"<ref>Carter, p. 174.</ref>\n\nThe TPF formed a [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] and attempted to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police.

All three papers covered the riots; the ''Daily News'' placed coverage on the front page. News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors that it had been organized by the [[Students for a Democratic Society]], the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], or triggered by \"a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes\".<ref name=\"teal4\"/> All day Saturday, June 28, people came to stare at the burned and blackened Stonewall Inn.

Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other. [[Craig Rodwell]] and his partner [[Fred Sargeant]] took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\" The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the \"intolerable situation\".<ref>Duberman, p. 205.</ref><ref>Teal, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nNot everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and many members of the Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. [[Randy Wicker]], who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the \"screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap.\"<ref>Duberman, p. 207.</ref> Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a \"sleaze joint\", as advantageous to the Village.<ref>Duberman, p. 206.</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday, however, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: \"forces of faggotry\", \"limp wrists\", and \"Sunday fag follies\".<ref name=\"Truscott\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uuwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K4wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6710,4693&dq=stonewall+inn&hl=en|title=Gay Power Comes to Sheridan Square|last=Truscott|first=Lucian|date=July 3, 1969|work=The Village Voice|page=1|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Carter (p. 201) attributes the anger at ''The Village Voice'' reports to its focus on the effeminate behavior of the participants, with the exclusion of any kind of bravery.

Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people.<ref>Duberman, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref><ref>Carter, pp. 203\u2013205.</ref> The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: \"The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have had it with oppression.\"<ref>Carter, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], called the [[Annual Reminder]]. Organizers [[Craig Rodwell]], [[Frank Kameny]], [[Randy Wicker]], [[Barbara Gittings]], and [[Kay Lahusen]], who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines.<ref>Marcus, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref> This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \"None of that! None of that!\" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches.<ref name=\"carter216-217\">Carter, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref><ref name=\"duberman210\">Duberman, p. 210.</ref> Participant [[Lilli Vincenz]] remembered, \"It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered.\"<ref name=\"carter216-217\"/> Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.<ref>Duberman, p. 211.</ref>\n\n[[File:Demonstration, with Gay Liberation Front Banner.jpg|thumb|Gay rights demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]], including members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). The GLF in the UK held its first meeting in a basement classroom at the [[London School of Economics]] on October 13, 1970. The organization was very informal, instituting marches and other activities, leading to the first British Gay Pride March in 1972.]]\n\n===Gay Liberation Front===\nAlthough the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, \"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\">LaFrank, p. 17.</ref><ref group=note>\"Hairpin drop\" was [[gay slang]] that meant to drop hints about one's sexual orientation. (LaFrank, p. 17.)</ref> When a Mattachine officer suggested an \"amicable and sweet\" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \"Sweet! ''Bullshit!'' That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play.\"<ref name=\"teal19\">Teal, p. 19.</ref> With a flyer announcing: \"Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!\",<ref name=\"teal19\"/> the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use \"gay\" in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.<ref>Clendinen, p. 31.</ref>\n\nThe rise of militancy became apparent to [[Frank Kameny]] and [[Barbara Gittings]]\u2014who had worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles\u2014when they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group. A young GLF member demanded to know who they were and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, \"I'm gay. That's why I'm here.\"<ref>Marcus, p. 136.</ref> The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|antiwar]] demonstrators with the ideal that they \"could work to restructure American society\".<ref>Duberman, p. 216.</ref> They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the [[New York Women's House of Detention|Women's House of Detention]] in support of [[Afeni Shakur]], and other radical [[New Left]] causes. Four months after the group formed, however, it disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.<ref>Carter, pp. 220\u2013221.</ref>\n\n===Gay Activists Alliance===\nWithin six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called ''Gay''; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city\u2014''The Village Voice''\u2014refused to print the word \"gay\" in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers.<ref>Clendinen, p. 40.</ref> Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: ''Come Out!'' and ''Gay Power''; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000.<ref name=\"carter242\">Carter, p. 242.</ref><ref>Duberman, p. 235.</ref>\n\nGLF members organized several same-sex dances, but GLF meetings were chaotic. When Bob Kohler asked for clothes and money to help the homeless youth who had participated in the riots, many of whom slept in Christopher Park or Sheridan Square, the response was a discussion on the downfall of [[capitalism]].<ref>Carter, p. 220.</ref> In late December 1969, several people who had visited GLF meetings and left out of frustration formed the [[Gay Activists Alliance]] (GAA). The GAA was to be entirely focused on gay issues, and more orderly. Their constitution started, \"We as liberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our dignity and value as human beings.\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> The GAA developed and perfected a confrontational tactic called a [[Zap (action)|zap]], where they would catch a politician off guard during a public relations opportunity, and force him or her to acknowledge gay and lesbian rights.

In March 1970, Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An after-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit was soon raided, and 167&nbsp;people were arrested. One of them was [[Diego Vi\u00f1ales]], an Argentinian national so frightened that he might be [[Deportation|deported]] as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} spike fence.<ref>Carter, pp. 238\u2013239.</ref> ''The New York Daily News'' printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page.

An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government.<ref>Cain, pp. 91\u201392.</ref> Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, \"By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred.\"<ref>Carter, p. 251.</ref>\n\nSimilar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as \"one of the greatest mistakes of his life\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\">Clendinen, p. 25.</ref> The image of gay people retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, \"stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\"/> Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, \"Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale.\"<ref>LaFrank, p. 21.</ref> David Carter, in his article \"What made Stonewall different\", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=David |title=What made Stonewall Different |journal=The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide |volume=16 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=11\u201313 |url=http://www.glreview.org/article/article-509/}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Unlikely community===\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.<ref>Adam, p. 82.</ref> People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]]. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place.<ref>Marcus, pp. 152\u2013155.</ref> Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after [[Barbara Gittings]] exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist [[Jean O'Leary]] protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by [[cross-dressers]] and [[drag queen]]s in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Lee Brewster]] jumped on the stage and shouted \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and ''these bitches'' tell us to quit being ourselves!\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.<ref name=\"duberman236\">Duberman, p. 236.</ref>\n\nO'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too difficult to attain.<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [[Tarrytown, New York|upstate New York]],<ref name=RiveraWholeInterview95>{{cite video |url=https://vimeo.com/35975275|title=Randy Wicker Interviews Sylvia Rivera on the Pier|time=Repeatedly throughout interview}} September 21, 1995.

Accessed July 24, 2015.</ref> The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \"Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\"<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> \"It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?\"<ref>Marcus, p. 156.</ref>\n\nO'Leary was referring to the [[Lavender Menace]], a description by [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]] for attempts by members of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, [[Rita Mae Brown]] and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.<ref>Adam, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe growth of [[lesbian feminism]] in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men.<ref name=\"faderman211-212\">Faderman, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> The issues most important to gay men\u2014[[entrapment]] and public solicitation\u2014were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what [[Adrienne Rich]] termed \"the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars\".<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/> Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, explaining \"It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena.\"<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, gay activism had significant successes. One of the first and most important was the \"zap\" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). At a conference on [[behavior modification]], during a film demonstrating the use of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] to decrease same-sex attraction, [[Morris Kight]] and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of \"Torture!\" and \"Barbarism!\"<ref name=\"williams\">Williams & Retter, p. 121.</ref> They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them. Although 20&nbsp;psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that homosexual people were not mentally ill.<ref name=\"williams\"/> When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought [[John E. Fryer]], a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger. In December 1973\u2014in large part due to the efforts of gay activists\u2014the APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]''.<ref>Marcus, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Cain, p. 65.</ref>\n\nGay men and lesbians came together to work in [[grassroots]] political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named [[Save Our Children]] staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in [[Dade County, Florida]]. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the [[Briggs Initiative]], designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated.<ref>Cain, p. 275.</ref> Reaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.<ref>Fejes, p. 214.</ref> The subsequent 1979 [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] was timed to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots.<ref name=\"Ghaziani\">Ghaziani, Amin. 2008. ''The Dividends of Dissent: How Conflict and Culture Work in Lesbian and Gay Marches on Washington''. The University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of prior gay subculture===\n\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior [[LGBT culture|gay and lesbian culture]], such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian [[Martin Duberman]] writes, \"The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\"<ref>Duberman, p. xv.</ref> Sociologist [[Barry D. Adam|Barry Adam]] notes, \"Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?\"<ref name=\"adam93\">Adam, p. 93.</ref> In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of [[butch and femme]] that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: \"all role playing is sick.\"<ref>Adam, p. 94.</ref> Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior.<ref>Faderman, p. 232.</ref> Some women, according to [[Lillian Faderman]], were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.<ref>Faderman, pp. 210, 266.</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Bronski highlights the \"attack on pre-Stonewall culture\", particularly [[Gay male pulp fiction|gay pulp fiction]] for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as \"an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men\",<ref>Bronski, p. 16.</ref> have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as political correctness, Bronski writes, \"gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of the past.\"<ref>Bronski, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Lasting impact and recognition===\n[[File:Stonewall Inn New York 002.JPG|thumb|alt=A color photograph of the Stonewall taken recently, showing a smaller plate glass window in a portion of the 1969 building|The Stonewall, a bar in part of the building where the [[Stonewall Inn]] was located. The building and the surrounding streets have been declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].]]\n\nThe riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \"exploitation and degradation\".<ref>Carter, p. 264.</ref> The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the \"ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality\".<ref>Carter, p. 266.</ref> Historian Nicholas Edsall writes,\n\n<blockquote>Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.<ref>Edsall, p. 333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and [[Adam Nagourney]] write,\n\n<blockquote>a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.<ref>Clendinen, p. 12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Lillian Faderman]] calls the riots the \"shot heard round the world\", explaining, \"The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they.\"<ref>Faderman, p. 195.</ref>\n[[File:Stonewall Inn raid sign pride weekend 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The sign left by police following the raid is now on display just inside the entrance]]\n\n[[Joan Nestle]] co-founded the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]] in 1974, and credits \"its creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\"/> Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism to the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes,\n\n<blockquote>I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall.<ref>Deitcher, p. 74.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe events of the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first instances of gay men and lesbians fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' [[Black Cat Tavern]] in 1967.<ref>Witt ''et al.'', p. 210</ref> However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the [[Lower Manhattan]] raid was a factor: it was across the street from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police.<ref name=\"armstrong\">Armstrong, Elizabeth&nbsp;A., Crage, Suzanna&nbsp;M.

These influences, along with the liberal environment of [[Greenwich Village]], served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.\n\nVery few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s. Those that did were often bars, although bar owners and managers were rarely gay.

Police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, but officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn. Tensions between [[New York City Police Department|New York City police]] and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening, and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents quickly organized into activist groups to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gay men and lesbians to be open about their [[sexual orientation]] without fear of being arrested.\n\nAfter the Stonewall riots, gay men and lesbians in New York City faced gender, race, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gay men and lesbians. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world.

Gay men and lesbians were [[lavender scare|included]] in this list by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] on the theory that they were susceptible to [[blackmail]]. In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by [[Clyde R.

Cities performed \"sweeps\" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.<ref>Adam, p. 59.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] listed homosexuality in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (''DSM'') as a mental disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent\u2013child relationships.

An organization named [[ONE, Inc.]] published a magazine called ''ONE''. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexual people in heterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually [[One, Inc. v. Olesen|went to the Supreme Court]], which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.<ref>Marcus, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[Homophile]] organizations\u2014as homosexual groups self-identified in this era\u2014grew in number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. [[Frank Kameny]] founded the Mattachine of [[Washington, D.C.]] He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at [[mental health professional]]s, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal.<ref>Marcus, pp. 80\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn 1965, news on [[Cuba]]n prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine New York and D.C. to organize protests at the [[United Nations]] and the [[White House]].

A cohort of poets, later named the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]\u2014both Greenwich Village residents\u2014also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality.

Wagner, Jr.]], who was concerned about the image of the city in preparation for the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]]. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.<ref>Carter, pp. 29\u201337.</ref> [[Entrapment]] usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together\u2014or the officer bought the man a drink\u2014he was arrested for [[solicitation]]. One story in the ''[[New York Post]]'' described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested.<ref>Carter, p. 46.</ref> Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.<ref>Duberman, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly-elected mayor [[John Lindsay]] to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City.

The legal drinking age was 18, and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called \"Lily Law\", \"Alice Blue Gown\", or \"Betty Badge\"<ref name=\"duberman187\">Duberman, p. 187.</ref>), visitors would have to be known by the doorman, or look gay. The entrance fee on weekends was $3, for which the customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for two drinks. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private \"bottle club\", but rarely signed their real names.<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or [[black light]]s. If police were spotted, regular white lights were turned on, signaling that everyone should stop dancing or touching.<ref name=\"duberman187\"/> In the rear of the bar was a smaller room frequented by \"queens\"; it was one of two bars where effeminate men who wore makeup and teased their hair (though dressed in men's clothing) could go.<ref name=\"duberman189\">Duberman, p. 189.</ref> Only a few [[Transvestism|transvestite]]s, or men in full [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], were allowed in by the bouncers. The customers were \"98 percent male\" but a few lesbians sometimes came to the bar. Younger homeless adolescent males, who slept in nearby [[Christopher Park]], would often try to get in so customers would buy them drinks.<ref>Duberman, p. 188.</ref> The age of the clientele ranged between the upper teens and early thirties, and the racial mix was evenly distributed among white, black, and Hispanic patrons.<ref name=\"duberman189\"/><ref>Deitcher, p. 70.</ref> Because of its even mix of people, its location, and the attraction of dancing, the Stonewall Inn was known by many as \"''the'' gay bar in the city\".<ref>Carter p. 74.</ref>\n\nPolice raids on gay bars were frequent\u2014occurring on average once a month for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car down the block, to facilitate resuming business as quickly as possible if alcohol was seized.<ref name=\"duberman183\"/><ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished.<ref name=\"duberman192-193\">Duberman, pp. 192\u2013193.</ref> During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their [[Conscription|draft card]]s as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested.<ref name=\"duberman192-193\"/> The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars\u2014including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots<ref>Carter, pp. 124\u2013125.</ref>\u2014and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.<ref name=\"teal4\"/><ref name=\"nyt62969\">{{Cite news |last=Eskow |first=Dennis |title=4 Policemen Hurt in 'Village' Raid: Melee Near Sheridan Square Follows Action at Bar |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0DE5DB1639EF3BBC4151DFB0668382679EDE |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 29, 1969 |page=33}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\n==Riots==\n\n===Police raid===\n[[File:Layout of the Stonewall Inn 1969-en.svg|thumb|alt=A color digital illustration of the station layout of the Stonewall Inn in 1969: a rectangular building with the front along Christopher Street; the entrance opens to a lobby where patrons could go to the larger part of the bar to the right that also featured a larger dance floor.

We're taking the place!\"<ref name=\"Carter, p. 137.\">Carter, p. 137.</ref> Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.&nbsp;194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate.\n\nHistorian [[David Carter (historian)|David Carter]] presents information<ref>Carter, pp. 96\u2013103</ref> indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay [[Wall Street]] customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205&nbsp;people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered,\n\n<blockquote>\"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room in the back of the bar. [[Maria Ritter (person)|Maria Ritter]], then known as male to her family, recalled, \"My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!\"<ref name=\"carter142\">Carter, p. 142.</ref> Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by \"feeling some of them up inappropriately\" while frisking them.<ref>Carter, p. 141.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=30em | align=left |quote=When did you ever see a fag fight back?...

Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required to wait in line for about 15&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=\"carter142\"/> Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150&nbsp;people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: \"Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic.\"<ref>Teal, p. 2.</ref>\n\nWhen the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the crowd\u2014most of whom were homosexual\u2014had grown to at least ten times the number of people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet.<ref>Carter, p. 147.</ref> Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, \"Gay power!\", someone began singing \"[[We Shall Overcome]]\", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with \"growing and intensive hostility\".<ref>Carter, pp. 147\u2013148.</ref> An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo. Author [[Edmund White]], who had been passing by, recalled, \"Everyone's restless, angry, and high-spirited. No one has a slogan, no one even has an attitude, but something's brewing.\"<ref>Carter, p. 148.</ref> Pennies, then beer bottles, were thrown at the wagon as a rumor spread through the crowd that patrons still inside the bar were being beaten.\n\nA scuffle broke out when a woman in handcuffs was escorted from the door of the bar to the waiting police wagon several times. She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as \"a typical New York butch\" and \"a dyke\u2013stone butch\", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]] for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight.<ref>Duberman, p. 196.</ref> Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown ([[Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie]] has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary<ref name=Chu>{{cite web|last=Chu |first=Grace |url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/77167-an-interview-with-lesbian-stonewall-veteran-storm-delarverie|title=An interview with lesbian Stonewall veteran Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie |publisher=AfterEllen.com |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Accounts of people who witnessed the scene, including letters and news reports of the woman who fought with police, conflicted.

At least one was already bleeding when taken out of the bar (Carter, pp. 152\u2013153). Craig Rodwell (in Duberman, p. 197) claims the arrest of the woman was not the primary event that triggered the violence, but one of several simultaneous occurrences: \"there was just ... a flash of group\u2014of mass\u2014anger.\"</ref>), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, \"Why don't you guys do something?\" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon,<ref>Carter, p. 152.</ref> the crowd became a mob and went \"berserk\": \"It was at that moment that the scene became explosive.\"<ref>Carter, p. 151.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The night they busted Stonewall | author=Lucian K.

Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses).<ref group=note>Witness Morty Manford stated, \"There's no doubt in my mind that those people were deliberately left unguarded.

Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because \"they didn't pay off the cops\", to which someone else yelled \"Let's pay them off!\"<ref name=\"carter156\">Carter, p. 156.</ref> Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted \"Pigs!\" and \"Faggot cops!\" Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600&nbsp;people, grabbed several people, including folk singer and mentor of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Dave Van Ronk]]\u2014who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: \"As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in...

No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot, although one sarcastic account by a heterosexual publication suggested it. (Carter, p. 260.) Although [[Sylvia Rivera]] recalls she was saddened and amazed by the turnout at Garland's funeral on Friday, June 27, she said that she did not feel like going out much but changed her mind later. (Duberman, pp. 190\u2013191.) Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square, and said, \"When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing.\" (Deitcher, p. 72.)</ref> Michael Fader explained,\n\n<blockquote>We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around\u2014it's like standing your ground for the first time and in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.<ref>Carter, p. 160.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Stonewall riots.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white photograph showing the backs of three uniformed police officers and a man with short-cropped hair in a suit pushing back a crowd of young men with longer hair dressed in jeans and contemporary clothing for the late 1960s, arguing and defying the police; other people in the background on a stoop are watching|This photograph appeared in the front page of ''[[The New York Daily News]]'' on Sunday, June 29, 1969, showing the \"street kids\" who were the first to fight with the police.]]\n\nThe only known photograph taken during the first night of the riots shows the homeless youth who slept in nearby Christopher Park, scuffling with police.<ref>Carter, p. 162.</ref> The Mattachine Society newsletter a month later offered its explanation of why the riots occurred: \"It catered largely to a group of people who are not welcome in, or cannot afford, other places of homosexual social gathering...

Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if he might have to use it against the mob or the police.

More than a hundred police were present from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth [[Organization of the New York City Police Department#Police precincts|Precinct]]s, but after 2:00&nbsp;a.m. the TPF arrived again. Kick lines and police chases waxed and waned; when police captured demonstrators, whom the majority of witnesses described as \"sissies\" or \"swishes\", the crowd surged to recapture them.<ref>Carter, p. 191.</ref> Street battling ensued again until 4:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref name=\"duberman204-205\">Duberman, pp. 204\u2013205.</ref>\n\n[[Beat Generation|Beat]] poet and longtime Greenwich Village resident [[Allen Ginsberg]] lived on Christopher Street, and happened upon the jubilant chaos. After he learned of the riot that had occurred the previous evening, he stated, \"Gay power! Isn't that great!... It's about time we did something to assert ourselves\", and visited the open Stonewall Inn for the first time. While walking home, he declared to Lucian Truscott, \"You know, the guys there were so beautiful\u2014they've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10&nbsp;years ago.\"<ref>Teal, p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Leaflets, press coverage, and more violence===\nActivity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday and Tuesday, partly due to rain. Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other. [[Craig Rodwell]] and his partner [[Fred Sargeant]] took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\" The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the \"intolerable situation\".<ref>Duberman, p. 205.</ref><ref>Teal, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nNot everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and many members of the Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. [[Randy Wicker]], who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the \"screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap.\"<ref>Duberman, p. 207.</ref> Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a \"sleaze joint\", as advantageous to the Village.<ref>Duberman, p. 206.</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday, however, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: \"forces of faggotry\", \"limp wrists\", and \"Sunday fag follies\".<ref name=\"Truscott\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uuwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K4wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6710,4693&dq=stonewall+inn&hl=en|title=Gay Power Comes to Sheridan Square|last=Truscott|first=Lucian|date=July 3, 1969|work=The Village Voice|page=1|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Carter (p. 201) attributes the anger at ''The Village Voice'' reports to its focus on the effeminate behavior of the participants, with the exclusion of any kind of bravery.

Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people.<ref>Duberman, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref><ref>Carter, pp. 203\u2013205.</ref> The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: \"The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have had it with oppression.\"<ref>Carter, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], called the [[Annual Reminder]]. Organizers [[Craig Rodwell]], [[Frank Kameny]], [[Randy Wicker]], [[Barbara Gittings]], and [[Kay Lahusen]], who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines.<ref>Marcus, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref> This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \"None of that! None of that!\" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches.<ref name=\"carter216-217\">Carter, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref><ref name=\"duberman210\">Duberman, p. 210.</ref> Participant [[Lilli Vincenz]] remembered, \"It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered.\"<ref name=\"carter216-217\"/> Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.<ref>Duberman, p. 211.</ref>\n\n[[File:Demonstration, with Gay Liberation Front Banner.jpg|thumb|Gay rights demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]], including members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). The GLF in the UK held its first meeting in a basement classroom at the [[London School of Economics]] on October 13, 1970. The organization was very informal, instituting marches and other activities, leading to the first British Gay Pride March in 1972.]]\n\n===Gay Liberation Front===\nAlthough the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, \"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\">LaFrank, p. 17.</ref><ref group=note>\"Hairpin drop\" was [[gay slang]] that meant to drop hints about one's sexual orientation. (LaFrank, p. 17.)</ref> When a Mattachine officer suggested an \"amicable and sweet\" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \"Sweet! ''Bullshit!'' That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play.\"<ref name=\"teal19\">Teal, p. 19.</ref> With a flyer announcing: \"Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!\",<ref name=\"teal19\"/> the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use \"gay\" in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.<ref>Clendinen, p. 31.</ref>\n\nThe rise of militancy became apparent to [[Frank Kameny]] and [[Barbara Gittings]]\u2014who had worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles\u2014when they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group. A young GLF member demanded to know who they were and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, \"I'm gay. That's why I'm here.\"<ref>Marcus, p. 136.</ref> The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|antiwar]] demonstrators with the ideal that they \"could work to restructure American society\".<ref>Duberman, p. 216.</ref> They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the [[New York Women's House of Detention|Women's House of Detention]] in support of [[Afeni Shakur]], and other radical [[New Left]] causes. Four months after the group formed, however, it disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.<ref>Carter, pp. 220\u2013221.</ref>\n\n===Gay Activists Alliance===\nWithin six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called ''Gay''; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city\u2014''The Village Voice''\u2014refused to print the word \"gay\" in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers.<ref>Clendinen, p. 40.</ref> Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: ''Come Out!'' and ''Gay Power''; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000.<ref name=\"carter242\">Carter, p. 242.</ref><ref>Duberman, p. 235.</ref>\n\nGLF members organized several same-sex dances, but GLF meetings were chaotic. When Bob Kohler asked for clothes and money to help the homeless youth who had participated in the riots, many of whom slept in Christopher Park or Sheridan Square, the response was a discussion on the downfall of [[capitalism]].<ref>Carter, p. 220.</ref> In late December 1969, several people who had visited GLF meetings and left out of frustration formed the [[Gay Activists Alliance]] (GAA). The GAA was to be entirely focused on gay issues, and more orderly. Their constitution started, \"We as liberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our dignity and value as human beings.\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> The GAA developed and perfected a confrontational tactic called a [[Zap (action)|zap]], where they would catch a politician off guard during a public relations opportunity, and force him or her to acknowledge gay and lesbian rights. City councilmen were zapped, and Mayor [[John Lindsay]] was zapped several times\u2014once on television when GAA members made up the majority of the audience.<ref>Carter, pp. 245\u2013246.</ref>\n\nRaids on gay bars did not stop after the Stonewall riots. In March 1970, Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An after-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit was soon raided, and 167&nbsp;people were arrested. One of them was [[Diego Vi\u00f1ales]], an Argentinian national so frightened that he might be [[Deportation|deported]] as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} spike fence.<ref>Carter, pp. 238\u2013239.</ref> ''The New York Daily News'' printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the Sixth Precinct in which hundreds of gay men, lesbians, and liberal sympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF.<ref name=\"carter242\"/> They also sponsored a letter-writing campaign to Mayor Lindsay in which the Greenwich Village [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and Congressman [[Ed Koch]] sent pleas to end raids on gay bars in the city.<ref>Teal, pp. 106\u2013108.</ref>\n\nThe Stonewall Inn lasted only a few weeks after the riot. By October 1969 it was up for rent. Village residents surmised it was too notorious a location, and Rodwell's boycott discouraged business.<ref>Carter, p. 252.</ref>\n\n===Gay Pride===\n{{main|NYC Pride March#Origins}}\n\nChristopher Street Liberation Day on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street; with simultaneous Gay Pride marches in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Chicago]], these were the first [[Pride parade|Gay Pride marches]] in U.S. history.<ref>Duberman, pp. 278\u2013279.</ref><ref>De la Croix, Sukie (2007).

The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers.<ref>Clendinen, pp. 62\u201364.</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15&nbsp;city blocks.<ref name=\"fosburgh\">Fosburgh, Lacey (June 29, 1970).

An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government.<ref>Cain, pp. 91\u201392.</ref> Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, \"By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred.\"<ref>Carter, p. 251.</ref>\n\nSimilar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as \"one of the greatest mistakes of his life\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\">Clendinen, p. 25.</ref> The image of gay people retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, \"stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\"/> Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, \"Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale.\"<ref>LaFrank, p. 21.</ref> David Carter, in his article \"What made Stonewall different\", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=David |title=What made Stonewall Different |journal=The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide |volume=16 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=11\u201313 |url=http://www.glreview.org/article/article-509/}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Unlikely community===\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.<ref>Adam, p. 82.</ref> People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]]. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place.<ref>Marcus, pp. 152\u2013155.</ref> Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after [[Barbara Gittings]] exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist [[Jean O'Leary]] protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by [[cross-dressers]] and [[drag queen]]s in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Lee Brewster]] jumped on the stage and shouted \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and ''these bitches'' tell us to quit being ourselves!\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.<ref name=\"duberman236\">Duberman, p. 236.</ref>\n\nO'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too difficult to attain.<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [[Tarrytown, New York|upstate New York]],<ref name=RiveraWholeInterview95>{{cite video |url=https://vimeo.com/35975275|title=Randy Wicker Interviews Sylvia Rivera on the Pier|time=Repeatedly throughout interview}} September 21, 1995.

Accessed July 24, 2015.</ref> The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \"Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\"<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> \"It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?\"<ref>Marcus, p. 156.</ref>\n\nO'Leary was referring to the [[Lavender Menace]], a description by [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]] for attempts by members of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, [[Rita Mae Brown]] and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.<ref>Adam, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe growth of [[lesbian feminism]] in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men.<ref name=\"faderman211-212\">Faderman, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> The issues most important to gay men\u2014[[entrapment]] and public solicitation\u2014were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what [[Adrienne Rich]] termed \"the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars\".<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/> Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, explaining \"It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena.\"<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, gay activism had significant successes. One of the first and most important was the \"zap\" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). At a conference on [[behavior modification]], during a film demonstrating the use of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] to decrease same-sex attraction, [[Morris Kight]] and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of \"Torture!\" and \"Barbarism!\"<ref name=\"williams\">Williams & Retter, p. 121.</ref> They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them. Although 20&nbsp;psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that homosexual people were not mentally ill.<ref name=\"williams\"/> When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought [[John E. Fryer]], a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger. In December 1973\u2014in large part due to the efforts of gay activists\u2014the APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]''.<ref>Marcus, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Cain, p. 65.</ref>\n\nGay men and lesbians came together to work in [[grassroots]] political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named [[Save Our Children]] staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in [[Dade County, Florida]]. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the [[Briggs Initiative]], designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated.<ref>Cain, p. 275.</ref> Reaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.<ref>Fejes, p. 214.</ref> The subsequent 1979 [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] was timed to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots.<ref name=\"Ghaziani\">Ghaziani, Amin. 2008. ''The Dividends of Dissent: How Conflict and Culture Work in Lesbian and Gay Marches on Washington''. The University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of prior gay subculture===\n\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior [[LGBT culture|gay and lesbian culture]], such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian [[Martin Duberman]] writes, \"The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\"<ref>Duberman, p. xv.</ref> Sociologist [[Barry D. Adam|Barry Adam]] notes, \"Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?\"<ref name=\"adam93\">Adam, p. 93.</ref> In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of [[butch and femme]] that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: \"all role playing is sick.\"<ref>Adam, p. 94.</ref> Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior.<ref>Faderman, p. 232.</ref> Some women, according to [[Lillian Faderman]], were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.<ref>Faderman, pp. 210, 266.</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Bronski highlights the \"attack on pre-Stonewall culture\", particularly [[Gay male pulp fiction|gay pulp fiction]] for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as \"an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men\",<ref>Bronski, p. 16.</ref> have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as political correctness, Bronski writes, \"gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of the past.\"<ref>Bronski, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Lasting impact and recognition===\n[[File:Stonewall Inn New York 002.JPG|thumb|alt=A color photograph of the Stonewall taken recently, showing a smaller plate glass window in a portion of the 1969 building|The Stonewall, a bar in part of the building where the [[Stonewall Inn]] was located. The building and the surrounding streets have been declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].]]\n\nThe riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \"exploitation and degradation\".<ref>Carter, p. 264.</ref> The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the \"ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality\".<ref>Carter, p. 266.</ref> Historian Nicholas Edsall writes,\n\n<blockquote>Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.<ref>Edsall, p. 333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and [[Adam Nagourney]] write,\n\n<blockquote>a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.<ref>Clendinen, p. 12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Lillian Faderman]] calls the riots the \"shot heard round the world\", explaining, \"The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they.\"<ref>Faderman, p. 195.</ref>\n[[File:Stonewall Inn raid sign pride weekend 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The sign left by police following the raid is now on display just inside the entrance]]\n\n[[Joan Nestle]] co-founded the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]] in 1974, and credits \"its creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\"/> Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism to the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes,\n\n<blockquote>I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure...

Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' [[Black Cat Tavern]] in 1967.<ref>Witt ''et al.'', p. 210</ref> However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the [[Lower Manhattan]] raid was a factor: it was across the street from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police.<ref name=\"armstrong\">Armstrong, Elizabeth&nbsp;A., Crage, Suzanna&nbsp;M.

''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        \n\n''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W.

Together they make up the subgenus called \u201cCitharoedus\u201d, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n<br />\n\n== Morphology ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />.

Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. \n<br />\n\n== Reproduction ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R.

Spawning occurs at dusk and eggs are released and fertilized in the water column <ref name=\":7\" />. \n\n== Habitat and Range ==\nThe Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hern\u00e1ndez, Sebasti\u00e1n, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>.

The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30\u00b0N - 30\u00b0S, 77\u00b0E - 124\u00b0W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991).

They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  \n\n== Habitat Threats ==\nThere are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n\n\nThese changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n\nAnother adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.''

Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities\u2019 limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />\n\n== Diet and Feeding ==\n''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2).

Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />.

It is the second installment in the [[Krrish (franchise)|''Krrish'' franchise]], being the continuation to ''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]'', and relates the story of Krishna, the son of the previous film's protagonists, who inherits his father's superhuman abilities. After falling in love with Priya, he follows her to Singapore, where he takes on the persona of \"Krrish\" to keep his identity secret while saving children from a burning circus. From that moment on he is regarded as a superhero, and must later thwart the plans of the evil Dr. Arya, who has a connection to Krishna's father, Rohit, the protagonist of the previous film.\n\n''Krrish '' was conceived to be a film of global significance and a trendsetter in Indian cinema, with visual effects on par with those from Hollywood. To that end, the effects team was aided by Hollywood's Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, and the stunts were choreographed by Chinese martial arts film expert [[Ching Siu-Tung|Tony Ching]]. The music was composed by [[Rajesh Roshan]], with the background score by [[Salim-Sulaiman]]. Filming was done to a large extent in Singapore as well as India.\n\nThe film was released worldwide on 23 June 2006 at a budget of {{INR}}400 million<ref name=\"Budget\"/> and on 1000 prints, both near-record amounts for an Indian film at the time. ''Krrish'' received mixed reviews from critics in India, but got a record opening week at the box office. A [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Krrish'' grossed a worldwide total of {{INR}}1.26 billion,<ref name=\"Kr\"/> becoming the [[List of Bollywood films of 2006|third highest earning Indian film of 2006]].\n\n''Krrish'' was nominated for eight [[Filmfare Awards]], including [[Filmfare Best Film Award|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Best Director Award|Best Director]], [[Filmfare Best Actor Award|Best Actor]] for Roshan, and [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award|Best Supporting Actress]] for Rekha, winning three, including [[Filmfare Best Special Effects Award|Best Special Effects]]. At the [[8th IIFA Awards|2007 IIFA Awards]], the film received nine nominations and won three, with one being [[IIFA Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Roshan. It also won the [[National Film Award for Best Special Effects]]. The third film in the series, ''[[Krrish 3]]'' was released in 2013.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Hatnote|The plot of the film connects with the predecessor. For more information on the predecessor's plot, see [[Koi... Mil Gaya#Plot|Koi... Mil Gaya]].}}\nFive-year-old Krishna Mehra, son of the late scientist Rohit Mehra, undergoes an [[intelligence quotient]] test by a professor, who suspects that he has superpowers, due to Krishna answering all the questions flawlessly. His grandmother Sonia takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna meets vacationing friends Priya and Honey when Krishna's friend Bahadur takes the girls' camping crew near his home to camp. Krishna saves Priya from a [[Hang gliding|hang glider]] accident and falls in love with her when spending time with her.\n\nAfter returning home to [[Singapore]], Priya and Honey are fired by their boss for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. To keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Sonia objects to this, saying that people will want to exploit his abilities. She then explains the events of [[Koi... Mil Gaya|the previous film]], and that Rohit was hired by scientist Siddhant Arya to design a computer that could see the future to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. Rohit later discovered that the purpose of the computer was not for good, so he destroyed it. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of trauma shortly thereafter. Krishna promises Sonia that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself; Honey and Priya are fired again.\n\nKrishna meets circus performer Kristian Li, who attempts to raise funds to pay for his young sister's leg surgery. He invites Krishna and Priya to his circus, where a fire breaks out during the performance. Several children remain trapped in the blaze. To save the children without revealing his abilities, Krishna dons a broken black mask and puts his jacket on inside-out, creating the persona of \"Krrish\". Later, when Kristian sees Krrish fighting some goons and removing his mask, he discovers his friend Krishna is Krrish. As Krrish is being offered a reward for his deeds, Krishna asks Kristian to assume the identity, so that he can pay for his sister's surgery.\n\nMeanwhile, Priya discovers that Krishna is Krrish upon seeing the footage from her video camera. She and Honey decide to release the footage on TV to make Krishna a star. Krishna arrives and overhears them talking about how Priya had lied to him, and how they will reveal his identity. Just before Priya confesses to Honey that she has genuinely fallen in love with Krishna, he leaves, dejected.\n\nAfter being confronted by Krishna at his apartment they talked what she said, Priya realises her mistake and stops her boss from revealing Krrish's identity. She then meets Vikram Sinha, who has been searching for Krishna for years. He tells them that Rohit is still alive; after completing the computer, he and Rohit tested it and saw Siddhant holding Rohit at gunpoint. Rohit understood that Siddhant was going to kill him and then use the computer for his own selfish needs. He was able to destroy it, before being taken prisoner by Siddhant.\n\nIn the present, Siddhant has rebuilt the computer after many years. He uses it to reveal his future and sees Krrish killing him. Siddhant then kills Kristian, thinking that he is Krrish. Krishna later follows Siddhant to his island lair. When Siddhant looks into the future again, he sees the same thing and is shocked to see Krrish still alive and on his island.\n\nWhen Krrish enters the compound, there is a vicious fight with Siddhant's thugs. Krrish eventually defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. However, Vikram is shot dead by Siddhant. Krrish eventually wounds Siddhant fatally. Before Siddhant dies, Krrish reveals himself as Krishna. After revealing to Rohit that he is his son, Krishna takes Priya and his father back to India, reuniting him with Sonia.

It is the second installment in the [[Krrish (franchise)|''Krrish'' franchise]], being the continuation to ''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]'', and relates the story of Krishna, the son of the previous film's protagonists, who inherits his father's superhuman abilities. After falling in love with Priya, he follows her to Singapore, where he takes on the persona of \"Krrish\" to keep his identity secret while saving children from a burning circus. From that moment on he is regarded as a superhero, and must later thwart the plans of the evil Dr. Arya, who has a connection to Krishna's father, Rohit, the protagonist of the previous film.\n\n''Krrish '' was conceived to be a film of global significance and a trendsetter in Indian cinema, with visual effects on par with those from Hollywood. To that end, the effects team was aided by Hollywood's Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, and the stunts were choreographed by Chinese martial arts film expert [[Ching Siu-Tung|Tony Ching]]. The music was composed by [[Rajesh Roshan]], with the background score by [[Salim-Sulaiman]]. Filming was done to a large extent in Singapore as well as India.\n\nThe film was released worldwide on 23 June 2006 at a budget of {{INR}}400 million<ref name=\"Budget\"/> and on 1000 prints, both near-record amounts for an Indian film at the time. ''Krrish'' received mixed reviews from critics in India, but got a record opening week at the box office. A [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Krrish'' grossed a worldwide total of {{INR}}1.26 billion,<ref name=\"Kr\"/> becoming the [[List of Bollywood films of 2006|third highest earning Indian film of 2006]].\n\n''Krrish'' was nominated for eight [[Filmfare Awards]], including [[Filmfare Best Film Award|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Best Director Award|Best Director]], [[Filmfare Best Actor Award|Best Actor]] for Roshan, and [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award|Best Supporting Actress]] for Rekha, winning three, including [[Filmfare Best Special Effects Award|Best Special Effects]]. At the [[8th IIFA Awards|2007 IIFA Awards]], the film received nine nominations and won three, with one being [[IIFA Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Roshan. It also won the [[National Film Award for Best Special Effects]]. The third film in the series, ''[[Krrish 3]]'' was released in 2013.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Hatnote|The plot of the film connects with the predecessor. For more information on the predecessor's plot, see [[Koi... Mil Gaya#Plot|Koi... Mil Gaya]].}}\nFive-year-old Krishna Mehra, son of the late scientist Rohit Mehra, undergoes an [[intelligence quotient]] test by a professor, who suspects that he has superpowers, due to Krishna answering all the questions flawlessly. His grandmother Sonia takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna meets vacationing friends Priya and Honey when Krishna's friend Bahadur takes the girls' camping crew near his home to camp. Krishna saves Priya from a [[Hang gliding|hang glider]] accident and falls in love with her when spending time with her.\n\nAfter returning home to [[Singapore]], Priya and Honey are fired by their boss for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. To keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Sonia objects to this, saying that people will want to exploit his abilities. She then explains the events of [[Koi... Mil Gaya|the previous film]], and that Rohit was hired by scientist Siddhant Arya to design a computer that could see the future to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. Rohit later discovered that the purpose of the computer was not for good, so he destroyed it. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of trauma shortly thereafter. Krishna promises Sonia that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself; Honey and Priya are fired again.\n\nKrishna meets circus performer Kristian Li, who attempts to raise funds to pay for his young sister's leg surgery. He invites Krishna and Priya to his circus, where a fire breaks out during the performance. Several children remain trapped in the blaze. To save the children without revealing his abilities, Krishna dons a broken black mask and puts his jacket on inside-out, creating the persona of \"Krrish\". Later, when Kristian sees Krrish fighting some goons and removing his mask, he discovers his friend Krishna is Krrish. As Krrish is being offered a reward for his deeds, Krishna asks Kristian to assume the identity, so that he can pay for his sister's surgery.\n\nMeanwhile, Priya discovers that Krishna is Krrish upon seeing the footage from her video camera. She and Honey decide to release the footage on TV to make Krishna a star. Krishna arrives and overhears them talking about how Priya had lied to him, and how they will reveal his identity. Just before Priya confesses to Honey that she has genuinely fallen in love with Krishna, he leaves, dejected.\n\nAfter being confronted by Krishna at his apartment they talked what she said, Priya realises her mistake and stops her boss from revealing Krrish's identity. She then meets Vikram Sinha, who has been searching for Krishna for years. He tells them that Rohit is still alive; after completing the computer, he and Rohit tested it and saw Siddhant holding Rohit at gunpoint. Rohit understood that Siddhant was going to kill him and then use the computer for his own selfish needs. He was able to destroy it, before being taken prisoner by Siddhant.\n\nIn the present, Siddhant has rebuilt the computer after many years. He uses it to reveal his future and sees Krrish killing him. Siddhant then kills Kristian, thinking that he is Krrish. Krishna later follows Siddhant to his island lair. When Siddhant looks into the future again, he sees the same thing and is shocked to see Krrish still alive and on his island.\n\nWhen Krrish enters the compound, there is a vicious fight with Siddhant's thugs. Krrish eventually defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. However, Vikram is shot dead by Siddhant. Krrish eventually wounds Siddhant fatally. Before Siddhant dies, Krrish reveals himself as Krishna. After revealing to Rohit that he is his son, Krishna takes Priya and his father back to India, reuniting him with Sonia. Rohit then uses his father's special computer to contact his alien friend Jadoo, whose spaceship is later seen from a distance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hrithik Roshan]] as Rohit Mehra and Krishna \"Krrish\" Mehra\n* [[Naseeruddin Shah]] as Dr. Siddhant Arya\n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as Priya Mehra / Priya Kalyanan, Krishna's love interest\n* [[Rekha]] as Sonia Mehra, Rohit's mother and Krishna's grandmother\n* [[Manini Mishra (actress)|Manini Mishra]] as Honey Arora, Priya's best friend\n* [[Sharat Saxena]] as Vikram Sinha\n* [[Archana Puran Singh]] as Nayantara, Priya and Honey's boss\n* Bin Xia as Kristian Li\n* [[Hemant Pandey]] as Bahadur\n* [[Puneet Issar]] as Komal Singh\n\n===Cameo=== \n*[[Akash Khurana]] as Catholic school principal\n*[[Kiran Juneja]] as Amisha Kalyanan, Priya's mother\n*Yu Xuan as Kristian Li's little sister\n*[[Preity Zinta]] as Nisha Mehra ; Krishna's mother\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn November 2004, the Roshans confirmed he would produce a sequel to ''[[Koi...
